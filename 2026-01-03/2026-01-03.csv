            • Venezuela attack: President Donald Trump said the US will indefinitely “run the country” of Venezuela after capturing President Nicolás Maduro in a large-scale military operation today. Trump claimed the US would do so until a “proper and judicious transition” occurs, but he did not provide further details. The US embargo on Venezuelan oil will remain in place, Trump said.
    


            • Maduro will face charges: Trump posted a photo of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima after his capture. The Venezuelan authoritarian leader is expected to arrive today in New York, where he will face drugs and weapons charges.
    


            • About the operation: Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were dragged from their bedroom by elite US forces during the raid, sources told CNN. Trump said no US service members were killed, though some were injured when a helicopter was hit during the attack.
    


            • What happens next: Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado has called for the country's opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia to be installed, while Venezuela's foreign minister insists Maduro remains the country's leader. 



            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was given “multiple very, very, very generous offers” to leave power, but “chose instead to act like a wild man” and “play around.”
    


            Speaking to the press Saturday after a US military operation that apprehended Maduro, Rubio said the Venezuelan leader had “multiple opportunities to find his way somewhere else.”
    


            “Instead, he wanted to play big boy,” Rubio said.
    


            President Donald Trump told Fox News Saturday that Maduro “wanted to negotiate at the end” and was “trying hard to make a deal.”
    


            “I didn't want to negotiate. I said, ‘Nope, we got to do it,'” Trump said.
    


            Rubio reiterated Saturday that Maduro was “a fugitive of American justice” and an illegitimate leader with a $50 million bounty.
    


            “I guess we saved $50 million,” he quipped, turning to Trump, who responded, “we should make sure.”
    


            “Don't let anybody claim it, nobody deserves it but us,” Trump added.
    


            US President Donald Trump said he did not talk about Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro during a recent phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
    


            “We never spoke about Maduro,” Trump told reporters at a news conference today.
    


            Trump added that he is “not thrilled with Putin” at the moment, saying, “He's killing too many people.”
    


Remember: Russia has remained a key ally of the Maduro regime in the face of Trump's campaign against the Venezuelan government.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued the US military mission that saw strikes in Venezuela and the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro was “not the kind of mission that you can do congressional notification on.”
    


            “It was a trigger-based mission in which conditions had to be met night after night. We watched and monitored that for number of days. So it's just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say, ‘Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days,'” Rubio told reporters in Florida on Saturday.
    


            “It's just not the kind of mission that you can pre-notify because it endangers the mission,” he said. He also said it was “largely a law enforcement function.”
    


            President Donald Trump added that “Congress has a tendency to leak.”
    


            CNN reported, according to numerous sources, that the administration notified congressional leadership and key committees about the operation after the fact.
    


            White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair in a previous interview that US strikes inside Venezuela would require congressional approval.
    


            During the operation in Venezuela early Saturday morning, “a handful of troops sustained bullet and shrapnel wounds, but none are life-threatening,” a source briefed on the matter told CNN.
    


            President Donald Trump told Fox News on Saturday that “a couple of guys were hit. But they came back and they're supposed to be in pretty good shape.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Saturday the United States military could have killed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro during its overnight operation if necessary.
    


                    “It could have happened,” Trump told reporters at a news conference at his Florida estate. “He was trying to get into a safe place. You know, the safe place's all steel, and he wasn't able to make it to the door because our guys were so fast.” 
                





            Trump reiterated how the US military “went through the opposition so fast,” while also noting that “there was a lot of opposition.”
    


            “People were wondering, do we get them by surprise? Sort of surprised, but they were waiting for something. It was a lot of opposition. There was a lot of gunfire,” he said.
    


            Maduro is aboard the USS Iwo Jima ship, and Trump posted an image of him in US custody shortly before the news conference began.
    


            President Donald Trump offered some more details on who is in charge in Venezuela after the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, saying that top US officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth would work with a “team” to help run the country.
    


            “It's largely going to be, for a period of time, the people that are standing right behind me. We're going to be running it. We're going to be bringing it back,” Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago club.
    


            The president was standing in front of Rubio, Hegseth, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine.
    


            He later clarified that Rubio and Hegseth would be a “team that's working with the people of Venezuela to make sure that we have Venezuela right,” raising the possibility of a power vacuum in the US' absence.
    


            Trump did not rule out the possibility of US military involvement, saying, “We're not afraid of boots in the ground.”
    


            He also said there are plans to “rebuild the oil infrastructure,” which he said would be “paid for by the oil companies directly.” Venezuela has massive reserves of crude oil.
    


            Trump did not provide a specific timeline but suggested the US would remain on site until the country is “put back on track.”
    


            Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine on Saturday described the operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro as an extensive meticulously planned operation that took months to prepare for and hours to carry out on the ground.
    


            Speaking at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Caine described the mission as a collaboration involving all branches of the military and intelligence agencies that requires months of preparation.
    


            That included tracking Maduro to “understand how he moved, where he lived, where he traveled, what he ate, what he wore,” Caine said.
    


            CNN previously reported that the CIA had installed a small team inside Venezeula over the summer to keep close watch on Maduro's activities.
    


            Late on Friday night, Caine added, more than 150 aircraft launched from 20 different bases on land and sea across the Western Hemisphere. Among them were helicopters carrying an extraction force that began their flight into Venezuela at just 100 feet above the water.
    


            The helicopters, safeguarded by a series of strikes carried out in the area, arrived at Maduro's compound around 1 a.m. ET. The effort to capture Maduro and his wife required multiple “self defense engagements” as the forces came under fire, Caine said, before flying out of Venezuela around 3:29 ET.
    


            Maduro and his wife were subsequently transferred to the USS Iwo Jima, where they're now on their way to New York to stand trial.
    


            “Failure of one component of this well-oiled machine would have endangered the entire mission, and failure is never an option for America's joint force,” Caine said.
    


            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine said Saturday that one US aircraft was struck during the operation to capture Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela but remained operational throughout the mission.
    


            “One of our aircraft was hit, but remained flyable, and as the president said earlier today, all of our aircraft came home, and that aircraft remained flyable during the rest of the mission, as the operation unfolded at the compound,” Caine said, speaking at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago alongside President Donald Trump.
    


            Caine also highlighted the role of intelligence teams in supporting the mission in real time.
    


            “Our air and ground intelligence teams provided real-time updates to the ground force, ensuring those forces could safely navigate the complex environment without unnecessary risk.”
    


            He added that US forces encountered resistance as they exited the country.
    


            “There were multiple self-defense engagements as the force began to withdraw out of Venezuela,” Caine said.
    


            US forces will remain in the region following large-scale strikes on Venezuela and the capture of President Nicolás Maduro overnight, said Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
    


                    “As we stand here this morning, our forces remain in the region at a high state of readiness, prepared to project power, defend themselves and our interests in the region,” he said at a news conference at President Donald Trump's Florida estate.
                





            Caine called the US operation a “testament to the dedication and unwavering commitment to justice and our resolve to hold accountable those who threaten peace and stability,” thanking those who carried out the mission.
    


            President Donald Trump said his administration has “superseded” the principles laid out in the Monroe Doctrine, which he said is sometimes referred to as the “Donroe Document.”
    


            “For decades, other administrations have neglected or even contributed to these growing security threats in the Western Hemisphere. Under the Trump administration, we are reasserting American power in a very powerful way in our home region,” Trump said.
    


            Trump also offered justification for the United States intervening, stating that Venezuela was “increasingly hosting foreign adversaries in our region and acquiring menacing offensive weapons that could threaten US interests and lives.” He added that Venezuela used those weapons last night.
    


            “All of these actions were in gross violation of the core principles of American foreign policy, dating back more than two centuries,” Trump said. “Not anymore.”
    


            Demonstrations are planned in cities across the US today against military action in Venezuela, after the US conducted a large-scale strike on the city of Caracas and captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
    


            “We need to take to the streets and say no to another endless war! The people of this country do not want another war! A U.S. war would cause death and destruction for the people of Venezuela,” the Answer Coalition, one group organizing the protests, wrote in a news release.
    


            Demonstrations are planned for Chicago, New York's Times Square, outside the White House in Washington, DC, along with city halls and statehouses across the country this afternoon.
    


            Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is expected to arrive in New York today and is likely to be taken to the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, a source tells CNN.
    


            The earliest he would be presented in court at the Southern District of New York in Manhattan is Monday, the source said.
    


            Maduro was indicted in SDNY in 2020, and a superseding indictment there was unveiled Saturday.
    


            President Donald Trump said Saturday that the US embargo on Venezuelan oil remains in place following the capture of Nicolás Maduro, while delivering a sharp warning to other political and military figures tied to the regime.
    


            Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida that the United States is maintaining economic and military pressure on Venezuela as it assesses next steps.
    


                    “Very importantly, the embargo on all Venezuelan oil remains in full effect. The American armada remains poised in position, and the United States retains all military options until United States' demands have been fully met and fully satisfied,” the president said.
                





            Trump also issued a direct warning to leaders associated with Maduro.
    


            “All political and military figures in Venezuela should understand what happened to Maduro can happen to them, and it will happen to them if they aren't just fair, even to their people,” he said.
    


            Trump said Maduro's removal marked a turning point for the country.
    


            “The dictator and terrorist, Maduro, is finally gone in Venezuela. People are free. They're free again. It's been a long time for them, but they're free,” he said.
    


            Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, who is aboard the USS Iwo Jima headed to New York, is expected to briefly stop at the US military base in Guantanamo Bay, before being transferred to New York, two sources familiar with the plans tell CNN.
    


            Part of the consideration is that this allows the transfer to made more quickly, according to a source. By putting him on plane there, officials can take him directly to New York instead of having to first present him at another court.
    


            The base, sometimes referred to as “Gitmo,” is located in southeastern Cuba, on the coast of Guantánamo Bay.
    


            The overnight mission to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was dubbed Operation Absolute Resolve, Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Saturday.
    


            “The operation, known as Operation Absolute Resolve, was discreet, precise and conducted during the darkest hours of January 2, and was the culmination of months of planning and rehearsal — an operation that frankly only the United States military could undertake,” he said.
    


            President Donald Trump said Saturday that the United States was prepared to mount a second attack on Venezuela if need be — though he suggested it was no longer necessary after military personnel were able to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in an overnight raid.
    


            “We were prepared to do a second wave if we needed to do so — we actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary, but now it's probably not,” Trump said in remarks from Palm Beach, Florida, on Saturday as he recounted the operation.
    


            “The first wave, if you'd like to call it that, the first attack was so successful, we probably don't have to do a second, but we're prepared to do a second wave, a much bigger wave, actually,” he continued.
    


            The president reiterated comments that the operation conducted in the early hours of Saturday morning, which saw elite US forces drag Maduro and his wife from their bedroom, was as “pinpoint” operation.
    


            And he added that subsequent military operations in Venezuela were in the planning phase but that the administration “probably won't have to do” them.
    


            President Donald Trump on Saturday praised the US operation that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, calling it a success and emphasizing that no American service members were killed and no US military equipment was lost.
    


            Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago club in South Florida, Trump described the operation as highly effective and said it involved extensive US military assets.
    


                    “If you would have seen what I saw last night, you would have been very impressed. I'm not sure that you'll ever get to see it, but it was an incredible thing to see not a single American service member was killed and not a single piece of American equipment was lost,” he said.
                





            “We had many helicopters, many planes, many, many people involved in that fight,” the president added.
    


            President Donald Trump said Saturday that the lights in Caracas were shut off as the Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro was captured overnight, praising those involved for executing the mission.
    


            “No nation in the world could achieve what America achieved yesterday, or frankly, in just a short period of time, all Venezuelan military capacities were rendered powerless as the men and women of our military, working with us, law enforcement, successfully captured Maduro in the dead of night. It was dark, the lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have,” Trump said in a news conference moments ago.
    


            “It was dark and it was deadly,” Trump added.
    


            President Donald Trump said Saturday that the US is “going to run” Venezuela indefinitely in the aftermath of the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
    


            “We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” he said during a press conference from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. “We don't want to be involved with having someone else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years. So we are going to run the country.”
    


            Trump added that he determined the US should take charge of Venezuela to ensure that the eventual next leader has the “good of the Venezuelan people in mind. But he offered no timeline for how long such a transition of power was expected to take.
    


            “We're going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place,” he said.
    


            Trump also said he planned to authorize US oil companies to take over Venezuela's energy infrastructure, asserting that the corporations would “spend billions of dollars” on the project.
    


            “We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” he said.
    


            An elite unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigations assisted with capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, sources familiar with the operation told CNN.
    


            The agency's Hostage Rescue Team embedded with the United States military as part of the special operation, a source told CNN.
    


            The Hostage Rescue Team, often referred to as HRT, is a specialized unit that deploys in a range of situations, including “high-risk arrests, undercover operations, and surveillance operations,” according to the FBI.

US President Donald Trump has published a photo of Nicolas Maduro blindfolded and handcuffed on board a US warship. The Venezuelan leader is currently being shipped to New York together with his wife to face charges of a “narco-terrorism conspiracy.”  

Trump had previously confirmed that US forces carried out large-scale overnight airstrikes on the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, and taken Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores captive. Both will “soon face the full wrath of American justice,” according to US Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello Rondon has told the country's troops to “trust the leadership,” while Foreign Minister Yvan Gil has accused Washington of seeking to gain control of the Latin American nation's natural resources.

Numerous videos have emerged of a series of heavy explosions across Caracas. Footage showing attacks in two other parts of the country has also been geolocated. One clip features the outline of several US Chinook military helicopters swooping across the city at low altitude.

In a statement, Moscow has condemned the US “aggression,” called for “immediate clarification” on Maduro's whereabouts and lamented that “ideological hostility has triumphed over businesslike pragmatism.”

American Senator Mike Lee announced on his personal X account that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had told him that Washington does not foresee any further military operations at this time and that the Venezuelan president will stand trial in the US.

Multiple Western countries have expressed “concern” and claimed they are monitoring developments with their diplomatic teams in the Venezuelan capital. 

03 January 2026

The press conference is over now, but we will continue to recap some of Trump's key quotes.

Trump says he and his administration have not spoken with exiled Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado since the capture of Maduro.

“I think it would be very difficult for her [to return to lead Venezuela],” the US president claimed.

“She does not have the support in Venezuela; she is a very nice woman, but she does not have the support.”

“We're going to have our very large US oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country and we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so. So we were prepared to do a second wave,” Trump has said. 

❗️ ‘US Ready to Stage Second & Much Larger Attack on Venezuela if Needed' – Trump ‘We assumed a second wave would be necessary but now it is probably not.' https://t.co/lNuLPMJ2FOpic.twitter.com/SG07jpOK7x



“The US is the curse upon all of Latin America,” former US Army officer Stanislav Krapivnik has told RT, condemning the capture of Venezuela's president Nicolas Maduro.

He described the US government as “entirely rogue” and becoming “more and more desperate,” arguing its true aims are to control the Western hemisphere's resources and push out rival powers like Russia and China.

Trump has claimed Maduro was trying to “get into a safe place” during the US capture operation. “You know, the safe place is all steel. And he wasn't able to make it to the door because our guys were so fast. They went through the opposition so fast, and there was a lot of opposition,” he added.

The capture of Nicolas Maduro is “clear kidnapping” and a “criminal and terrorist act” which violates international law, the UN Charter, as well as the US's own internal laws, the Venezuelan ambassador to South Africa, Carlos Feo Acevedo, has told RT.

Acevedo confirmed that the Venezuelan authorities have no information about the whereabouts of President Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and has demanded “proof of life” from Washington.





Trump has made a comment on Colombian President Gustavo Petro's reaction to Maduro's capture, saying that the latter is “making cocaine,” which is being sent to the US, so Petro “does have to watch his ass.”

.@POTUS on Colombian President Gustavo Petro: ""He's making cocaine. They're sending it into the United States — so he does have to watch his ass."" https://t.co/mRqOsouW8Vpic.twitter.com/aJeFDbuylk



Secretary of State Marco Rubio is working on ‘dealing' with the vice president of Venezuela, Trump has said. “I understand she was just sworn in, but she was jsut picked by Maduro, So Marco [US Secretary of State Rubio] is working on that directly. He's just had a conversation with her and we think she's ready to do what we think is necessary to essentially make Venezuela great again,” he added.

Venezuelan opposition figure Maria Corina Machado, however, is “willing to do what's necessary.”



When asked about US presence in Venezuela and what he means by “running the country,” Trump said he was “designating people” and “talking to people” about it.

Trump is back at the podium, answering questions.

03 January 2026

Venezuela condemns the “serious military aggression” perpetrated against it by the US, the Latin American nation's foreign minister, Yvan Gil, has said in a statement.

The American strikes targeted civilian and military areas in Caracas and the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, he said.

These actions violate the UN charter, infringe upon Venezuela's sovereignty, endanger millions of people and threaten stability in the region, Gil stressed.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has imposed a state of emergency over the US attack, the Latin American nation's foreign minister, Yvan Gil, has said in a statement. “The entire country must activate to defeat this imperialist aggression,” he said.

""The objective of this attack is none other than to seize the strategic resources of Venezuela, particularly its oil and minerals... They will not succeed,” Gil insisted.

The US Embassy in Caracas has issued a Level 4 notice to American citizens, saying: “Do not travel to Venezuela for any reason.”



US President Donald Trump held a national security meeting at Mar-a-Lago before striking Venezuela, The New York Times has reported.

The White House hasn't yet confirmed it ordered the strikes.

The US has hit the Venezuelan parliament building, according to Colombian President Gustavo Petro. At least 11 sites in the country were attacked, he said.

Footage from Caracas has captured an explosion rocking the Cuartel de la Montana, the resting place of Hugo Chavez, who served as president of Venezuela between 2002 and his death in 2013.

Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez has labeled the US attack on Venezuela “state terrorism” and demanded an urgent response from the international community to the “criminal” act. “Our Zone Of Peace is being brutally assaulted,” he wrote on X.

A US official has told the Wall Street Journal that the White House will release an official statement on the attack against Venezuela after American forces leave the country's airspace.

The US Senate Armed Services Committee had not been notified by the White House about any military action against Venezuela, CNN has reported, citing an informed source.

Speaking to RT from Caracas, Jesus Rodriguez-Espinoza, a former Venezuelan diplomat and editor of the Orinoco Tribune, said that he believed the ultimate target of the strikes was Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

He added that while the US has the world's most powerful military, it would struggle to maintain a presence in Venezuela or impose a puppet government, which he said Washington had been attempting to do for decades.

”We have been preparing for this, and we are ready to defend Venezuela from any gringos that try to put boots on the ground,” he said.

MOSCOW, January 3. /TASS/. The United States is undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait by selling arms to Taiwan, Chinese Ambassador to Moscow Zhang Hanhui stated in an interview with TASS.

""The American side publicly announced plans to sell a large consignment of modern weapons to Taiwan, which grossly violates the one-China principle and the provisions of the three joint Sino-American communiques, seriously damages China's sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, significantly undermines peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and sends a profoundly false signal to separatist forces advocating for 'Taiwan independence,'"" he said.

The diplomat stressed that ""the Chinese side strongly objects to and condemns these actions"" and has already ""made a serious protest to the American side.""

MOSCOW, January 3. /TASS/. An act of armed aggression by the United States against Venezuela prompts deep concern and condemnation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

""Earlier today, the United States carried out an act of armed aggression against Venezuela. This has prompted deep concern and condemnation,"" the ministry said. ""The pretexts cited to justify such actions are untenable. Ideologized hostility has prevailed over pragmatic considerations, as well as over a willingness to build relations based on trust and predictability,"" the statement said.

The ministry emphasized that, under the current circumstances, ""it is crucial, above all, to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue."" ""We proceed from the assumption that all partners who may have claims against one another should seek ways to resolve their problems through dialogue-based solutions. We are ready to support them in this,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own fate without any destructive external interference, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. ""Latin America must remain a zone of peace, as it proclaimed itself in 2014. Venezuela, in turn, must be guaranteed the right to independently determine its own fate, free from any destructive — let alone military — interference from outside,"" the Foreign Ministry emphasized.

""We reaffirm our solidarity with the Venezuelan people and our support for the course of its Bolivarian leadership, aimed at protecting the country's national interests and sovereignty,"" the ministry said.

Russia is maintaining constant contact with the Venezuelan authorities, the ministry said. ""The Russian Embassy in Caracas <…> is maintaining constant contact with the Venezuelan authorities,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

""The Russian Embassy in Caracas is operating as normal, taking into account the current situation,"" the ministry added.

On January 3, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto said that the United States had attacked civilian and military facilities in Caracas, describing Washington's actions as military aggression. A state of emergency has been imposed in Venezuela. US President Donald Trump confirmed that the United States had carried out large-scale strikes on Venezuela. According to him, the country's leader, Nicolas Maduro, along with his wife, was captured and taken out of the country.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

US president made comments after US military special forces captured Venezuelan president and wife

Donald Trump has said the US will be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela's oil industry after launching a military attack that swept the country's authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, from power.

The president gave a phone interview to the conservative Fox News channel hours after a dramatic pre-dawn assault on Caracas and the surrounding region ended in the capture of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.

Asked about the future of Venezuela's oil industry, Trump replied: “We're gonna be very strongly involved in it. That's all. What can I say? We have the greatest oil companies in the world – the biggest, the greatest, and we're going to be very much involved in it.”

Maduro, a 63-year-old former bus driver handpicked by the dying Hugo Chávez to succeed him in 2013, has accused the US of seeking to take control of his nation's oil reserves, the biggest in the world.

At around 2am on Saturday, explosions rocked Caracas with blasts, aircraft and black smoke seen for about 90 minutes. The Venezuelan government said the attacks also took place in the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira.

Trump took a victory lap in his Fox News interview, remarking: “I've never seen anything like this. I was able to watch it in real time and I watched every aspect of it.”

Describing the moment that Maduro was captured, the president said: “He was in a house that was more like a fortress than a house. It had steel doors, it had what they call a safety space where it's solid steel … He was trying to get into it, but he got bumrushed so fast that he didn't.”

The raid had been planned for several days earlier but repeatedly delayed because of weather, Trump said. Some US forces were injured but he believes “we had nobody killed”.

“We were prepared to do a second wave. We were all set – and this was so lethal, this was so powerful, that we didn't have to … We were out there with an armada like nobody's ever seen before.”

Trump said Maduro and his wife had been whisked by helicopters to the USS Iwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship in the Caribbean, ahead of their transfer to New York. “They're on a ship, and they'll be heading into New York … They went by helicopter on a nice flight. I'm sure they loved it.”

In the run-up to the attack, Trump had sought a blockade of Venezuelan oil and expanded sanctions against the Maduro government, and staged more than two dozen strikes on vessels the US alleges were involved in trafficking drugs, killing more than 110 people.

Describing his discussions with Maduro in recent weeks, Trump recalled: “I said, ‘You have to give up. You have to surrender' – and he was close, but in the end, we had to do something that was really much more surgical, much more powerful … This was a very important symbol.”

It was unclear if the US would now stand back while other senior figures in Venezuela's ruling party – such as the vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez – fill the void or if there would be pressure for their removal as well.

Asked what is next for the Venezuelan people, Trump replied: “We're making that decision now. We can't take a chance on letting somebody else run it and just take over where he left off … We'll be involved in it very much. And we want to do liberty for the people.”

Maduro was indicted in US federal court in 2020 on narco-terrorism and other charges for running what prosecutors called a scheme to send tonnes of cocaine to the US through an alleged Cartel de los Soles. He has always denied the allegations.

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, wrote on X about Maduro and his wife. “They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.”

The US has not made such a direct intervention in its back-yard region since the invasion of Panama 37 years ago to depose the military leader Manuel Noriega over similar allegations.

Venezuela's ruling “Chavismo” movement, named for Maduro's revered predecessor Hugo Chávez, said civilians and military personnel died in Saturday's strikes but did not give figures.

The opposition, headed by recent Nobel peace prize winner María Corina Machado, had no immediate comment but has said for 18 months that it won the 2024 election and has a democratic right to take power.

Venezuelan allies Russia, Cuba and Iran were quick to condemn the strikes as a violation of sovereignty. Iran urged the UN security council to stop the “unlawful aggression”. Argentina's president, Javier Milei, lauded Venezuela's new “freedom”, while Mexico condemned the intervention and Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said it crossed “an unacceptable line”.

Maduro was captured by a team that included elite US special forces, including the US army's Delta Force, a US official told the Reuters news agency.

JD Vance, the US vice-president, posted on the X social media platform: “The president offered multiple off ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States. Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says. Kudos to our brave special operators who pulled off a truly impressive operation.”

Republican Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House of Representatives, said: “Today's military action in Venezuela was a decisive and justified operation that will protect American lives.”

But Democrats roundly condemned the intervention for illegally bypassing Congress. Mark Warner, vice-chair of the Senate select committee on ontelligence, said: “If the United States asserts the right to use military force to invade and capture foreign leaders it accuses of criminal conduct, what prevents China from claiming the same authority over Taiwan's leadership?

“What stops Vladimir Putin from asserting similar justification to abduct Ukraine's president? Once this line is crossed, the rules that restrain global chaos begin to collapse, and authoritarian regimes will be the first to exploit it.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The novelty of eating at a diner owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off in just a few months

Less than six months since it opened, Elon Musk's Tesla Diner has the feel of a ghost town. Gone is the Optimus robot serving popcorn, gone are the carnivore-diet-inspired “Epic Bacon” strips, gone are the hours-long, hundred-person lines wrapped around the block. Even the restaurant's all-star chef, Eric Greenspan, is gone. The Hollywood burger-and-fries shop seems like a shell of the bustling eatery it was when it opened in late July.

On a balmy Friday afternoon in December, the parking lot for Tesla car charging was, at best, half full. Inside what the company describes as a “retro-futuristic” diner, a handful of people trickled in, ordering burgers and hotdogs or asking for merch. The upstairs deck, AKA “Skypad”, was vacant except for a pair of employees stringing holiday lights. More staff was busy at work, buffing fingerprints off the chrome walls and taking out the trash, than there were customers. The diner was spotless.

The novelty of eating at a restaurant owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off. When the Tesla diner opened in summer, it brought in droves of the CEO's fans and curious onlookers. But then came the onsite anti-Musk protests, noise complaints from neighbors and customers who said menu items often sold out or, when they were available, were served soggy and cold.

Greenspan, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who helped launch the Mr Beast Burger chain, told the Los Angeles Times last month that he was leaving the Tesla Diner to focus on opening a Jewish deli called Mish. According to Eater, the chef removed his previous Instagram posts referencing the Tesla Diner as a newly minted ex-boyfriend might.

Greenspan has not publicly said why he left and did not return a request for comment. Tesla also did not return a request for comment.

Greenspan and other California restaurateurs who praised the Tesla Diner faced pushback for supporting Musk. The Tesla CEO is seen as a polarizing figure who donated nearly $300m to get Donald Trump elected and then led the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in its rapid and haphazard teardown of federal agencies. During a speech at Trump's inauguration, Musk made what rights groups have described as back-to-back Nazi salutes – something repeatedly portrayed in the picket signs held by Tesla Diner protesters.

Musk has been talking about the concept of a 50s-style Tesla diner in LA since at least 2018 as part of an idea to have amenities for waiting drivers connected to Supercharger stations. He touted the plans for it in 2023 as “Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging” and claimed the diner would launch later that year. When it finally did open in the summer of 2025, he called it “one of the coolest spots in LA” and vowed that if the concept went well Tesla would open diners in major cities around the world. So far, there is only one.

“This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it's worth visiting,” Musk said on Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, just two days after the diner opened. “It's a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape.”

The diner received immense media coverage upon opening but poor reviews from restaurant critics, who described the food as forgettable and the concept as little more than a corporate branding exercise. Its menu consisted of fast-food staples like a $13.50 smash burger, AKA “Tesla Giga Burger”, and an $8 milkshake, along with more internet-coded foods like the $12 maple-glazed “Epic Bacon” strips and a small-sized $8 “Wagyu Beef Chili Cup”.

A display case with Tesla merchandise featured a “levitating Cybertruck” figurine for $175 and a black hoodie emblazoned with a graphic of the diner for $95.

Tesla posted on X in October that it had sold 50,000 burgers since its opening – an average of a little over 700 a day. Musk proclaimed that month that the diner was a success and suggested that he would open others near Tesla offices in Palo Alto and Austin. Tesla has yet to announce any formal plans for expansion.

On social media, the wave of food influencers making TikTok and Instagram videos about the diner slowed in the months after its opening. Reviewers commenting on the $13 hotdog or posing next to the giant drive-in screens playing Star Trek are now relatively rare. Musk, who usually posts dozens of times a day on X, has only made scant mentions of the diner on the platform and didn't address it on Tesla's third quarter earnings call in October.

The diner also appears to have pivoted to hosting some events, including a “Holiday Bash on The Skypad” in mid-December featuring unlimited Tesla food and beverages, plus a live DJ, for $75 a ticket.

As the diner narrows its ambitions, some of the customer complaints have likewise waned. The pared down menu is fully stocked, and food came out hot and fast on the balmy Friday in December. One enthusiastic Yelp reviewer said she recently visited the diner on a Saturday night. She posted a photo of her meal, saying “the burger was solid and the fries were perfectly crispy”.

“Best part was that it wasn't crowded at all,” she added.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Trump is no longer bending the rules – he is demolishing them, with consequences far beyond Caracas

US strikes on Venezuela – live updates

Hardly anyone expected 2026 to be a year of peace, and it was barely three days old when the worst fears were confirmed.

The overnight strikes on Venezuela – and the abduction of its leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife – have driven another truck through international law and global norms. But that is not even the most concerning thing about it.

Donald Trump has been driving convoys of bulldozers through that increasingly fragile edifice since taking office nearly a year ago, and now it is mostly wreckage. The events overnight were preceded by airstrikes on small boats in the seas off Central America and the killing of their crews based on unproven allegations of drug trafficking, and the armed seizure of Venezuelan oil tankers on the high seas. It is not yet known how many people were killed in the capture of Maduro in the early hours of Saturday.

In terms of global stability, the worst thing about the Maduro rendition is that it worked.

Trump's belief in his own global omnipotence, and his desire to grab the territory and natural resources of other countries has been held in check until now by his fear of entanglement in foreign wars. He claimed (falsely) to have ended eight wars, and his greatest ambition in 2025 seemed to be winning the Nobel Peace prize. Less than a month ago he was brandishing a hastily confected substitute, the Fifa peace prize. That act of self-abasement by world football's governing body looks even more absurd now than it did when Trump grabbed the gold medal and put it around his own neck.

Trump's fear of foreign wars seems to be waning. He was clearly thrilled by the drama of the Maduro operation, and the efficiency of the American soldiers who carried it out. For an ageing president, growing more petulant, irascible and incoherent with every day in office – facing diminishing popularity and desperate to distract attention from the Epstein child-trafficking scandal – a tightening embrace of military power is an ominous development.

On Saturday morning, Trump seemed giddy with military success.

“A lot of good planning and a lot of great, great troops and great people,” Trump told the New York Times. “It was a brilliant operation, actually.”

The attack on Venezuela (which was initially planned for Christmas Day, according to one US report) suggests the allure of foreign lands, oil and minerals is now glimmering brighter than the Nobel prize.

It was mostly left to others in the Trump administration to cast the attack in legal language and suggest that Maduro was being “brought to justice”. The Venezuelan leader was indicted in the US at the end of the first Trump term on corruption, drug trafficking and other offences.

Maduro is a dictator who has run an authoritarian state since 2013 with the help of elections widely regarded as rigged. But the specific drug allegations made against him by the US are seen by most experts as flimsy, and would not represent convincing grounds under international or US law for the attack on Venezuela and Maduro's abduction. In repeated statements, Trump has made clear he is more covetous of Venezuela's oil (the largest proven reserves in the world) than motivated by a desire to bring Maduro before a court, or deliver democracy to the people of Venezuela.

The international laws and norms Trump has barged through had already been loosened by previous US administrations. The operation most closely resembles the 1990 invasion of Panama and forced surrender of its strongman, by the first Bush administration.

That was followed by the younger George Bush with the invasion of Iraq on false grounds, and his administration's broad use of rendition of torture. Barack Obama failed to hold his predecessor's administration to account and pursued his own legally questionable drone assassination campaign against suspected terrorists.

These are arguably discrete acts of hypocrisy by earlier presidents, who claimed exceptions from international laws in the pursuit of US interests, but mostly embraced global norms in the knowledge that the “rules-based system” overwhelmingly favoured America.

Trump has complete disdain for that system. He looks at the world through the eyes of a 19th-century imperialist, but with 21st-century weapons.

It is unclear how far Trump intends to go in Venezuela to advance his aims, and how far the current regime is able to resist, but a peaceful outcome seems a remote prospect.

What unfolded overnight in Venezuela will cause immediate anxiety to governments like Iran and Denmark, against whom Trump has expressed enthusiasm for taking radical action.

In recent days, Trump has said the US would come to the defence of Iranian anti-government protesters, and his officials have kept up a drumbeat of threats to take control of Greenland by any necessary means. Last month, the Danish Defence Intelligence Service labelled the US as a security risk, a declaration that would have been unthinkable just a short time ago for a Nato ally.

It accelerates the slide from a mostly rules-based world to one of competing spheres of influence, to be determined by armed might and the readiness to use it. One American commentator, David Rothkopf, called it the “Putinization of US foreign policy”.

Russian commentators have frequently suggested that Latin America lies in America's domain just as Ukraine was under the Russian shadow. Vladimir Putin thinks the same of much of eastern Europe. Xi Jinping will draw his own conclusions.

The peril made brutally clear in the first few days of 2026 is one that will ultimately be faced by everyone.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A magnitude 6.5 earthquake on Friday rattled Mexico's capital and a tourist hotspot on the Pacific coast, killing at least two people and causing moderate damage in a small town near the epicenter.

The US Geological Survey said the quake struck shortly before 8am near Acapulco, a major port and beach resort.

It was felt about 400km away to the north in Mexico City, where alarms sent people rushing into the street for safety, disrupting a holiday weekend.

A 60-year-old man died after falling while evacuating his second-floor apartment in the capital, local authorities said.

Twelve others were injured, city Mayor Clara Brugada wrote on social media, but there were no reports of major damage in the country's largest city.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was forced to evacuate the presidential palace during her regular morning press conference.

Mexico's National Seismological Service said the earthquake's epicenter was 14km southwest of the town of San Marcos in the state of Guerrero.

Sheinbaum said there were no immediate reports of major damage, but in San Marcos, the effects were visible.

A woman in her 50s “lost her life when her house collapsed on top of her,” Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado said. 

San Marcos Mayor Misael Lorenzo Castillo said about 50 houses were destroyed and “all the houses have cracks.” 

Mexico is situated between five tectonic plates and as such is one of the world's most-seismically active countries.

Karen Gomez, a 47-year-old office worker living on the 13th floor of an apartment building in Mexico City, said she was roused from her sleep by a street siren.

“I woke up in terror. My cellphone alert said it was a powerful earthquake.”

Kindergarten director Norma Ortega, 57, who lives in a 10th-floor apartment, said she felt her building shake.

In Acapulco, Ricardo, a tourist from the central Mexican state of Morelos, fled his hotel shirtless after sirens sounded.

The center of Mexico City is built on the muddy subsoil of what was once the bed of a lake, making it particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. 

The quakes most strongly felt usually originate off Guerrero state on the Pacific coast.

“The United States should prepare itself because Donald Trump will fall seriously ill,” Juan de Dios Garcia proclaimed as he gathered with other shamans on a beach in southern Lima, dressed in traditional Andean ponchos and headdresses, and sprinkling flowers on the sand.
The shamans carried large posters of world leaders, over which they crossed swords and burned incense, some of which they stomped on.

Sacred ancient gems linked to the Buddha were unveiled yesterday in India for the first time since their colonial-era removal.

The Piprahwa gems, a collection of more than 300 precious stones and ornaments believed to have been buried with relics of the Buddha at a stupa site in northern India, were formally displayed at an exhibition in New Delhi.

“This historic event marks the reunification of the Piprahwa gem relics of Lord Buddha, repatriated after 127 years,” the Indian Ministry of Culture said, adding that they are on display for the first time since British excavations in 1898 unearthed them and they were subsequently scattered across the world.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who opened the exhibition, said it was a “very special day for those passionate about history, culture and the ideals” of the Buddha.

The Buddha — who renounced material wealth to embrace and preach a life of non-attachment — founded a religion that now has more than 500 million adherents.

Born in what is now Nepal, he spent much of his life in northern India.

The gems, believed to date back to about 200BC, were unearthed in 1898 by British colonial engineer William Claxton Peppe in Piprahwa, India.

Indian authorities said an inscription on one of the caskets unearthed with the treasure confirmed the contents — which include bone fragments — as “relics of the Buddha.” 

While the majority were handed over to colonial authorities and some were housed in the Indian Museum in Kolkata, Peppe kept a treasure trove of jewels.

In May last year, Peppe's great-grandson, Chris Peppe, put the gems up for sale.

They were listed for auction by Sotheby's in Hong Kong, with a starting bid of US$1.2 million, with experts suggesting they could have made 10 times that.

The auction was canceled after the ministry issued a legal order calling the jewels the “inalienable religious and cultural heritage of India and the global Buddhist community.”

The gems were then bought by an Indian conglomerate, Godrej Industries Group, in partnership with the Indian government. The sale price was not disclosed.

“The Piprahwa gems are not just artifacts,” company vice-chairman Pirojsha Godrej said. “They are timeless symbols of peace, compassion and the shared heritage of humanity.”

Chris Peppe said his family was happy that the “gems will be available for the public” to see.

The exhibition in New Delhi brings together the recently returned jewels, other treasures stored in Kolkata and relics from later excavations in the 1970s.

Modi has in the past loaned parts of the Piprahwa collection for brief exhibitions to places with major Buddhist populations, including Russia's Kalmykia region and neighboring Bhutan.

The ministry said the return of the gems was part of Modi's “broader mission to reclaim and celebrate Bharat's [India's] ancient cultural and spiritual heritage from across the world.”

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday called on Israel to end a ban on humanitarian agencies that provided aid in Gaza, saying he was “deeply concerned” at the development.

Guterres “calls for this measure to be reversed, stressing that international non-governmental organizations [NGOs] are indispensable to life-saving humanitarian work and that the suspension risks undermining the fragile progress made during the ceasefire,” his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.

“This recent action will further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians,” he added.

Israel on Thursday suspended 37 foreign humanitarian organizations from accessing the Gaza Strip after they had refused to share lists of their Palestinian employees with government officials. 

The ban includes Doctors Without Borders, which has 1,200 staff members in the Palestinian territories — the majority of whom are in Gaza.

NGOs included in the ban have been ordered to cease their operations by March 1.

Several NGOs have said the requirements contravene international humanitarian law or endanger their independence.

Israel said the new regulation aims to prevent bodies it accuses of supporting terrorism from operating in the Palestinian territories.

On Thursday, 18 Israel-based left-wing NGOs denounced the decision to ban their international peers, saying “the new registration framework violates core humanitarian principles of independence and neutrality.”

A fragile ceasefire has been in place since October, following a deadly war waged by Israel in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

In November, authorities in Gaza said more than 70,000 people had been killed there since the war broke out.

Nearly 80 percent of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged by the war, according to UN data, leaving infrastructure decimated.

About 1.5 million of Gaza's more than 2 million residents have lost their homes, Palestinian NGO Network in Gaza director Amjad al-Shawa said.

“The United States should prepare itself because Donald Trump will fall seriously ill,” Juan de Dios Garcia proclaimed as he gathered with other shamans on a beach in southern Lima, dressed in traditional Andean ponchos and headdresses, and sprinkling flowers on the sand.
The shamans carried large posters of world leaders, over which they crossed swords and burned incense, some of which they stomped on.

Since proclaiming independence in 1945, the Southeast Asian country had continued to operate under a colonial framework widely criticized as outdated and misaligned with Indonesia's social values.

The move comes as US President Donald Trump has made threats in the past few months to retake control of the canal, claiming Beijing has too much influence in its operations.

European national security advisors arrived in Kyiv early on Jan. 3 to take part in a high-level meeting of the so-called Coalition of the Willing.

The visit follows a Dec. 30 statement by President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he announced a number of meetings set for early January, among them an advisor-level meeting in Kyiv and a leader-level gathering in France.

""A busy working day lies ahead: security and economic issues, work on framework documents, coordination of further steps with partners,"" National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov said.

Umerov said representatives from Germany, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Finland, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway, as well as NATO, the European Council, and the European Commission, will take part in the meetings.

The meetings come as Kyiv and its partners continue work on a draft peace plan aimed at ending Russia's war in Ukraine.

On Dec. 28, Zelensky met with U.S. President Donald Trump at his residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida.

The leaders discussed a draft agreement outlining security guarantees for Ukraine, as well as a 20-point plan for ending the war. The original U.S.-proposed 28-point plan had effectively pressured Kyiv to capitulate, reinforcing Russia's maximalist demands.

During a joint press conference with Zelensky on Dec. 28, Trump said the peace talks were in their ""final stages,"" without providing further details.

The meetings did not produce a breakthrough. After his conversation with Trump, Zelensky held a joint call with European leaders. Trump, in turn, also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country,"" Donald Trump said on Truth Social.

""We held consultations with Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, and I count on lawmakers' support,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 3.

""A busy working day lies ahead: security and economic issues, work on framework documents, coordination of further steps with partners,"" National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov said.

Russia launched 95 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. 

The bodies of a 3-year-old boy and a woman, likely his mother, were found in the rubble of an apartment building following Russian strikes. Search and rescue operations are still active at 3 a.m. local time, according to governor Syniehubov.

The number includes 750 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day, the General Staff said.



The news comes a few hours after Zelensky announced he would appoint Kyrylo Budanov, head of the military intelligence, to take charge of the President's Office.



Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko will soon give the president a list of possible candidates to replace Serhii Deineko as head of Ukraine's State Border Guard Service.

Following are reactions to Saturday's U.S. strikes on Venezuela.

RUSSIA FOREIGN MINISTRY

“This morning, the United States committed an act of armed aggression against Venezuela. This is deeply concerning and condemnable.”

“The pretexts used to justify such actions are unfounded. Ideological animosity has prevailed over business pragmatism and the willingness to build relationships ​based on trust and predictability.”

“In the current situation, it is important, first and foremost, to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of ‍the situation through dialogue.”

“Latin America must remain a zone of peace, as it declared itself to be in 2014. And Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, interference from outside.”

“We support the statement by the Venezuelan authorities and the leaders of Latin American countries calling for an immediate meeting of the UN Security Council.”

CHINA FOREIGN MINISTRY

China's ​foreign ministry said in ‍a statement that it condemned ‍the ​U.S. action in Venezuela, which it said violated international law.

“China is deeply shocked ⁠and strongly condemns the use of force by the U.S. against a sovereign ‌country and ‍the use of force ‍against the president ‌of a country,” ⁠the foreign ministry said.

“China ​firmly opposes such hegemonic behaviour by the U.S., which seriously violates international law, violates Venezuela's sovereignty, ​and threatens peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean. We urge the U.S. to ⁠abide by international law and ⁠the purposes and principles ‌of the UN Charter and stop violating the sovereignty and security of other countries.”

FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER

“The military operation that led to the capture of Nicolas Maduro violates the principle of not resorting to force, that underpins international law. France reiterates that no lasting political solution can be imposed from the outside and that only sovereign people themselves can decide their future,” Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot wrote on X.

CANADA FOREIGN MINISTER

Minister of Foreign Affairs Anita Anand said in a statement that Canada has refused to recognize the legitimacy of the Maduro regime and opposed the repression of the Venezuelan people.

“In keeping with our long-standing committment of upholding the rule of law and democracy, Canada calls on all parties to respect the international law and we stand by the people of Venezuela and their desire to live in a peaceful and democratic society.”

Ms. Anand said Canada is engaging with its international partners and monitoring developments closely. 

ARGENTINE PRESIDENT JAVIER MILEI

“FREEDOM MOVES FORWARD. LONG LIVE FREEDOM DAMMIT,” wrote Milei, a strong regional ally of Donald Trump.

Milei uploaded a video with his statement on X, where he is seen talking at a summit and describing Maduro as a threat for the region and backing the pressure ‍Trump was putting ​on Caracas.

“The time to have a timid approach on this subject has passed,” Milei had said, according to a video on his X account.

MEXICAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

“The Mexican government strongly condemns and rejects the military actions carried out unilaterally in recent hours by the armed forces of the United States of America against targets in the territory of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in clear violation of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations.”

“Mexico emphatically reiterates that dialogue and negotiation are the only legitimate and effective means of resolving existing differences, and therefore reaffirms its willingness to support any efforts to facilitate dialogue, mediation, or accompaniment that contribute to preserving regional peace and avoiding confrontation.”

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER KEIR STARMER

“I want to establish the facts first. I want to speak to President Trump. I want to speak to allies. I can be absolutely clear that we were not involved ... and I always say and believe we should all uphold international law,” Starmer said in a statement to British broadcasters.

BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA ON X:

“The bombings on Venezuelan ⁠territory and the capture of its president cross an unacceptable line. These acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela's sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community.”

“Attacking countries in flagrant violation of international law is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability, where the law of the strongest prevails over multilateralism.”

UKRAINE'S FOREIGN MINISTER ANDRII SYBIHA:

“Ukraine has consistently defended the right of nations to live freely, free of dictatorship, oppression, and human rights violations. The Maduro regime has violated all such principles in every respect.”

“We stand for further developments in accordance with the principles of international law, prioritising democracy, human rights, and the interests of Venezuelans.”

BELARUS PRESIDENT ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO

“The President of Belarus CATEGORICALLY CONDEMNS the act of American aggression against Venezuela. Alexander Lukashenko spoke about the consequences just recently in an interview with American journalists. In particular, he said that “it will be a second Vietnam. And the Americans don't need it,” Belta news agency cited Natalia Eismont, spokesperson for Lukashenko, as saying

ECUADOR PRESIDENT GABRIEL NOBOA

“The time is coming for all the narco-Chavista criminals. Their structure will finally collapse ‌across the entire continent,” he wrote on X.

“To Corina Machado, Edmundo Gonzalez, and the Venezuelan people: ‍it is time to reclaim your country. You have an ally in Ecuador.”

URUGUAY FOREIGN MINISTRY

“The Government of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay is following with close attention and serious concern the events that have been reported from Venezuela in recent hours, including U.S. air strikes against Venezuelan military installations and civilian infrastructure.”

“Uruguay ‍rejects, as it always has, military intervention by one country in the territory of another and reaffirms the importance of respecting international law and the UN Charter, in ‌particular the basic principle that States must refrain from resorting to the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”

PERU FOREIGN MINISTRY

“The Government of Peru calls for a prompt solution to the political situation in Venezuela, in ‍favor of a transition with full respect for international law and human rights, as well as attention to the legitimate and genuine aspirations of the Venezuelan people to live in ‌democracy with the support of the regional community.

“The illegitimate government of Nicolás Maduro violated the human rights of the Venezuelan people and subjected them to torture and arbitrary and illegal detentions, destroying the rule of law and causing an unprecedented migration crisis in the region.”

EUROPEAN UNION HIGH REPRESENTATIVE FOR ⁠FOREIGN AFFAIRS KAJA KALLAS:

“I have spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and our Ambassador in Caracas. The EU is closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela.”

“The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint.”

EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT URSULA VON DER LEYEN:

“Following ​very closely the situation in Venezuela. We stand by the people of Venezuela and support a peaceful and democratic transition. Any solution must respect international law and the UN Charter.”

CHILE'S PRESIDENT GABRIEL BORIC ON X:

“As the Government of Chile, we express our concern and condemnation of the military actions of the United States in Venezuela and call for a peaceful solution to the serious crisis affecting the country.”

“Chile reaffirms its commitment to the basic principles of international law, such as the prohibition of the use of force, non-intervention, the peaceful settlement of international disputes, and the territorial integrity of States.”

COLOMBIA'S PRESIDENT GUSTAVO PETRO ON X:

“The Government of the Republic of Colombia views with deep concern the reports of explosions and unusual air activity in recent hours in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, as well as the resulting escalation of tension in the region.

“Colombia reaffirms its unconditional commitment to the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, in particular respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, the prohibition of the use or threat of use ​of force, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes. In this regard, the Colombian Government rejects any unilateral military action that could aggravate the situation or put the civilian population at risk.

IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI:

“What matters is that when a person realizes the enemy is arrogantly trying to impose something on the country, on the officials, on the government, and on the nation, one must stand firmly against the enemy and bare one's chest in resistance. We will not yield to the enemy.”

“Relying on Almighty God, trusting in God, and with confidence in the support of the people, God willing and by divine grace, we will bring the enemy to its knees.”

SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTRY:

“Spain calls for de-escalation and moderation, and for action to always be taken in accordance with international law and the principles of the UN Charter.”

“In this regard, Spain is willing to offer its good offices to achieve a peaceful and negotiated solution to the current crisis.”

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO PRIME MINISTER KAMLA PERSAD-BISSESSAR

“Earlier this morning, Saturday 3rd January 2026, the United States commenced military operations within the territory of Venezuela.

“Trinidad and Tobago is NOT a participant in any of these ongoing military operations. Trinidad and Tobago continues to maintain peaceful relations with the people of Venezuela.”

RODERICH KIESEWETTER, PROMINENT MP FROM GERMANY'S CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION:

“With President Trump, the U.S. are abandoning the rules-based order that has shaped us since 1945.”

“The coup in Venezuela marks ⁠a return to the old U.S. doctrine from before 1940: a mindset of thinking in terms of spheres of influence, where the law of force rules, not international law.”

“Trump is destroying what was left of any trust in the U.S.”

JUERGEN HARDT, FOREIGN POLICY SPOKESMAN OF GERMAN CONSERVATIVES' PARLIAMENTARY GROUP:

“For many years, Maduro suppressed civil ⁠society in Venezuela and supported terrorism and drugs in the region as a tool of power to destabilise his opponents. This was a violation of international law. “

“From a human rights perspective, the end of his rule is good news.”

BRITAIN'S REFORM UK PARTY LEADER NIGEL FARAGE

“The American actions in Venezuela overnight are unorthodox and contrary to international law - but if they make China and Russia think twice, it may be a ‌good thing.”

“I hope the Venezuelan people can now turn a new leaf without Maduro.”

ITALIAN OPPOSITION PARTY LEADER AND FORMER PRIME MINISTER GIUSEPPE CONTE:

“The American aggression against Venezuela has no legal basis. We are facing a blatant violation of international law, which certifies the dominance of the strongest and best equipped militarily... I hope that the entire international community will make its voice heard and that everyone will understand that if rules only apply to enemies and not to friends, no one can feel safe anymore. Nor can the illiberal nature of a government's rule justify an attack to a sovereign state.”

UK CHATHAM HOUSE THINK TANK'S PROGRAMME DIRECTOR FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW, MARC WELLER

“International law prohibits the use of force as a means of national policy. Short of a U.N. Chapter VII mandate, force is only available in response to an armed attack or possibly to rescue a population under imminent threat of extermination.”

“Clearly, none of these requirements are fulfilled by the armed operation against Venezuela. The U.S. interest in repressing the drugs trade or claims that the Maduro government was in essence a criminal enterprise offers no legal justification.”

INDONESIA'S FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON, YVONNE MEWENGKANG:

Indonesia is monitoring developments in ‌Venezuela to ensure the safety of its citizens.”

“Indonesia also calls on all relevant parties to prioritize peaceful resolution through de-escalation and dialogue, while prioritizing the protection of civilians.”

“Indonesia emphasizes the importance of respecting international law and the principles of the UN Charter.”

Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro speaks during a ceremony to swear in new community-based organizations on Dec. 1, 2025.Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters

Nicolás Maduro ruled Venezuela with a heavy hand for more than 12 years, ‍presiding over deep economic and social crises and resisting pressure from domestic opponents and foreign governments for political change. His rule abruptly ended on Saturday when President Donald Trump announced U.S. forces had captured him and flown him out of the country.

U.S. strikes Venezuela and says its leader, Maduro, has been captured and flown out of the country

A 63-year-old socialist and the handpicked successor of the late Hugo Chavez, Maduro was long accused by critics both at home and abroad of being a ‍dictator who ​jailed or persecuted political opponents and repeatedly staged sham elections. Maduro, a salsa aficionado with a flair for theatrics, often called opposition politicians “fascist demons” and took pride in resisting U.S. pressure against him, even having his invocation to Trump of “yes peace, not war” remixed into an electronica song. He was sworn in for a third term in January 2025 following a 2024 election that was widely condemned as fraudulent by international observers and the opposition. Thousands of people who protested against the government's declaration of victory were jailed.

Venezuela's opposition, the United States and many other Western countries also considered Maduro's election win in 2018 to be a sham. His government's ⁠repressive measures were highlighted by the awarding of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

After Trump announced last October that he was authorizing CIA operations in the country, Maduro blasted “those demonic powers that aim to sink their claws into Venezuela to steal our oil.” Maduro has long denied U.S. accusations of connections to drug smuggling and corruption.

In August, Washington doubled its reward for Maduro's arrest to $50-million over allegations of drug trafficking and links to criminal groups.

Trump ratcheted up the pressure in recent months with a huge build-up of the U.S. military in the southern Caribbean, more than two dozen strikes ‌on vessels allegedly involved in trafficking drugs in the Pacific ‍Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and a ramping up of sanctions.

MADURO DENIED ACCUSATIONS OF RIGHTS ABUSES 

A U.N. Fact-Finding Mission found last month that the country's Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) committed serious ‍human rights violations and crimes against humanity over more than a decade in targeting political opponents.

Maduro long ‌denied abusing political and human rights, instead describing his government as being at odds with what he views as a decades-long imperialist campaign to topple ⁠Chavez's socialist movement and take Venezuela's oil.

He and his government called sanctions by the U.S. and others illegitimate measures that amounted to an “economic war” designed to cripple the country. His supporters hailed him as a hero who stood ​up to Washington in the tradition of Cuba's Fidel Castro.

Protesters led months of demonstrations in 2017 against Maduro's government, a period marked by accusations of torture, arbitrary arrests and abuse by security forces. Those protests left 125 people dead. Dozens more died during protests after Maduro's inauguration to his second term in 2019. After the 2024 election, the U.N. found that Maduro's government escalated repressive tactics to crush peaceful protests, with over two dozen dead and 2,400 arrests.

Maduro's rule was marked by an extended economic collapse in the once relatively affluent nation that prompted an exodus of some 7.7 million migrants.

Almost 82% of ​Venezuelans live in poverty, with 53% in extreme poverty, unable to buy even basic foodstuffs, a U.N. special rapporteur said in 2024 after visiting the country.

BUS DRIVER'S RISE TO POWER

Maduro was born into a working-class family on November 23, 1962, son of a trade union leader. He worked as a bus driver during the time army officer Chavez led a failed coup attempt in 1992.

He agitated for Chavez to be released from prison and backed his fervent leftist agenda in an era when socialism was well out of favor.

After Chavez's 1998 election, Maduro won a seat in the legislature and spent years championing his mentor's self-styled revolution against U.S. intervention in Latin America.

Adversaries took swipes at Maduro's working-class roots and portrayed him as a buffoonish cretin who did little more than slavishly repeat Chavez's bombast.

But the ⁠criticism made little dent in his meteoric rise: he became president of the National Assembly and later foreign minister. In that role he crisscrossed the globe to help build alliances with other ⁠developing countries through oil-financed assistance programs.

Maduro was narrowly elected president after Chavez died from cancer in 2013. But there was a gaping chasm between his own appeal and the legendary charisma of his predecessor.

His rule was quickly plagued by ‌bread lines and product shortages that smacked of Soviet-era collapse, largely due to his unwillingness to unwind lavish Chavez-era subsidies that were unsustainable after the oil boom came to an end.

As inflation soared in 2013, Maduro sent troops to occupy shops that sold home appliances and forced them to sell off their wares at fire-sale prices, helping fuel his popularity in the run-up to a nationwide election for mayors.

In 2018, militants attempted to assassinate him by sending explosives-laden drones over the top of a rally he was addressing on a Caracas avenue, leading him to reduce his spontaneous public appearances and limit live broadcasts of public events.

Throughout his career, Maduro was often flanked by ‌his wife, Cilia Flores, who held numerous high-ranking positions, including attorney general and chief of parliament, and was often seen as a power broker with as much influence as her spouse.

Trump said on Saturday Flores was also captured and flown out of the country.

The GOP-led North Carolina legislature has siphoned off some of the powers that traditionally belonged to the governor.

This story was originally published by
 ProPublica.


North Carolina voters have chosen Democrats in three straight elections for governor; the state's Republican-led legislature has countered by siphoning off some of the powers that traditionally came with the job.

These power grabs have had a profound effect on both democracy in the state and on the everyday lives of North Carolina residents, Democrats argue.

The changes are “weakening environmental protections, raising energy costs, and politicizing election administration,” Josh Stein, North Carolina's governor, said in a text message responding to questions from ProPublica.

Republican leaders in the General Assembly did not respond to requests for comment or emailed questions about the power shifts. In the past, they have defended these actions as reflecting the will of voters, with the senate president describing one key bill as balancing “appointment power between the legislative and executive branches.”

Former state Sen. Bob Rucho, a Republican picked to sit on the state elections board after lawmakers shifted control from Stein to the Republican state auditor, said the changes would fix problems created by Democrats.

“Republicans are very proud of what's been accomplished,” Rucho said. Shifting authority over the elections board, he argued, would “reestablish a level of confidence in the electoral process” that Democrats had lost.

ProPublica recently chronicled the nearly 10-year push to take over the board, which sets rules and settles disputes in elections in the closely divided swing state. Decisions made by the board's new leadership — particularly on the locations and numbers of early voting sites — could affect outcomes in the 2026 midterms.

Below, we examine how other power transfers driven by North Carolina's Republican legislature are reshaping everything from the regulations that protect residents' drinking water to the rates they pay for electricity to the culture of their state university system.

What it is: The Environmental Management Commission adopts rules that protect the state's air and water, such as those that regulate industries discharging potentially carcinogenic chemicals in rivers.

Power transfer: In October 2023, Republican legislators passed a law shifting the power to appoint the majority of the commission's members from the governor to themselves and the state's commissioner of agriculture, who is a Republican.

What's happened since: The new Republican-led commission has stymied several efforts by the state's Department of Environmental Quality to regulate a potentially harmful chemical, 1,4-dioxane, in drinking water.

Advocates for businesses, including the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce, had criticized some regulations and urged the commission to intervene. “Clean water is worth the cost, but regulators should not arbitrarily establish a level that is low for the sake of being low,” the chamber said in a press release.

The Southern Environmental Law Center, which has pressed the state to regulate the chemical, has said the commission's rulings are “crippling the state's ability to protect its waterways, drinking water sources, and communities from harmful pollution.”

What it is: The North Carolina Utilities Commission regulates the rates and services of the state's public utilities, which include providers of electricity, natural gas, water and telephone service. The commission also oversees movers, brokers, ferryboats and wastewater.

Power transfer: In June 2025, a trial court sided with the General Assembly in allowing a law passed in 2024 to take effect, removing the governor's power to appoint a majority of the commission's members and transferring that power to legislative leaders and the state treasurer, who is a Republican.

What's happened since: The state's primary utility, Duke Energy, has backed off from some plans to rely more on clean energy and retire coal-fired power plants. In November, the company said it would seek the commission's approval to raise rates by 15%.

In response to a new resource plan the company filed in October, the executive director of NC WARN, a climate and environmental justice nonprofit, said in a statement that Duke's actions would cause “power bills to double or triple over time” and increase carbon emissions. The state's governor and attorney general, both Democrats, have said they oppose the rate hike.

Garrett Poorman, a spokesperson for Duke Energy, said that the company is “focused on keeping costs as low as possible while meeting growing energy needs across our footprint” and that the company had recently lowered its forecasted costs.

The commission will decide whether to approve the proposed rate hikes in 2026.

What it is: The University of North Carolina System encompasses 17 institutions and more than 250,000 students, including at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, considered one of best in the nation.

Power transfer: Though the legislature has traditionally appointed the majority of the trustees for individual schools, the governor also made a share of these appointments.

In 2016, the legislature passed a law that eliminated the governor's ability to make university trustee appointments.

In 2023, changes inserted into the state budget bill gave the legislature power to appoint all of the members of the state board that oversees community colleges and most of those colleges' trustees. The governor had previously chosen some board members and trustees.

What's happened since: The system has created a center for conservative thought, repealed racial equity initiatives, suspended a left-leaning professor, gutted a civil rights center led by a professor long critical of Republican lawmakers and appointed politically connected Republicans to the boards.

Republicans say the moves are reversing the system's long-term leftward drift.

“Ultimately, the board stays in for a while, and you change administrators, and then start to moderate the culture of the UNC schools,” said David Lewis, a former Republican House member who helped drive the changes to the university system.

Democrats, including former Gov. Roy Cooper, have criticized the board changes as partisan meddling.

“These actions will ultimately hurt our state's economy and reputation,” Cooper said in a 2023 press release.

This article has been updated to include new statements from Donald Trump.

President Donald Trump announced early January 3 that the U.S. has captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro after a series of late night airstrikes on Caracas, Venezuela's capital, carried out by the U.S. military.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump boasted that the U.S. has “successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela” and said that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been “captured and flown out of the country.” 

Attorney General Pam Bondi said that Maduro has been charged with “Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy,” among other charges, in the Southern District of New York. She posted a copy of the indictment on social media.

On Saturday morning, in his first speech after the invasion, Trump said, “We are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.” He offered few details and no timeline regarding the American occupation of the country, but later said he was “not afraid of boots on the ground.” When asked by reporters about the potential cost of occupying Venezuela for an undefined period of time, Trump said, “It won't cost us anything because the money coming out of the ground is very substantial.” 

Throughout his comments, Trump repeatedly referenced Venezuela's vast oil reserves and said that U.S. oil interests would be heavily involved in the country's future. “We're going to have our very large United States oil companies — the biggest anywhere in the world — go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.”

Trump's comments were a sharp turn from the administration's reasoning for its months-long boat strike campaign that has killed over 100 civilians. Comparatively, he also spoke very little about the indictment, despite administration officials touting its charges against Maduro as the reasoning for Saturday morning's operation.

The reported kidnapping comes after the U.S. carried out late night airstrikes across Caracas, striking fear among the residents of the densely populated city. Reports say the strikes lasted about 30 minutes, and it's unclear whether there were casualties.

In a speech aired on state television, Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said the government has demanded proof of life from the U.S. Venezuelan officials have said that they aren't aware of Maduro's whereabouts. 

The Associated Press reports that, according to Venezuelan ruling party leader Nahum Fernández, Maduro and his wife were captured from their home in the Fuerte Tiuna military installation, which was bombed in the wave of airstrikes.

“There, they carried out what we could call a kidnapping of the president and the first lady of the country,” said Fernández.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said in a post on X that Secretary of State Marco Rubio claims the strikes were carried out to “protect” those carrying out the arrest, reported to be U.S. special operations forces. Lee said that the military action “likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack” — a framing that experts and lawmakers have said is a farce, as there is no evidence of an “imminent” threat from Venezuela.

Lee added that Rubio told him he anticipates no further actions against Venezuela with Maduro in U.S. custody.

In an interview on Fox News on Saturday morning, however, Trump suggested that the U.S. may carry out more strikes if Venezuelan officials continue to side with Maduro. “If they stay loyal, the future is really bad, really bad for them,” he said.

The U.S. has a long history of capturing world leaders in relation to drug charges, but not quite in this manner. Just last month, Trump condemned President Joe Biden's arrest of Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras who was out of office when he was extradited to the U.S., on drug charges in 2022, saying: “If somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.” The statement came as Trump pardoned Hernández, who had been sentenced to 45 years in prison.

Commentators noted that the capture most echoes the U.S. invasion of Panama, which began in December of 1989. Under President George H.W. Bush, U.S. forces captured the country's leader, Manuel Antonio Noriega, exactly 36 years ago on January 3. Noriega had been indicted for drug charges by a grand jury in the U.S. in 1988.

World leaders, legal experts, and U.S. lawmakers have widely condemned the strikes and reported kidnapping as a violation of international law, coming as an escalation after a series of boat strikes and oil tanker seizures that experts have already long deemed illegal. 

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo condemned the action in a statement and suggested that the U.S. has violated its obligations under the UN Charter to “refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.”

Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, said that the U.S.'s actions crossed a line. “Attacking countries, in flagrant violation of international law, is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability, where the law of the strongest prevails over multilateralism,” he said. 

Other countries, including Cuba, Iran, and Russia have similarly condemned the strikes and reported kidnapping. 

By contrast, the response out of Europe has been relatively muted. Kaja Kallas, the EU's top foreign affairs official, said that the EU is “closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela” but emphasized that the “EU has repeatedly stated that Mr. Maduro lacks legitimacy.” EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made a similar statement, and urged restraint in accordance with international law. “We stand by the people of Venezuela and support a peaceful and democratic transition,” she wrote.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer merely said that the U.K. was not involved in the action and declined to condemn the strikes when asked by reporters on Saturday.

While some Republican lawmakers celebrated the action, other members of Congress decried the bombardment and reported kidnapping.

“Secretaries Rubio and [Pete] Hegseth looked every Senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn't about regime change. I didn't trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” said Sen. Andy Kim (D-New Jersey) in a post on social media. 

Kim warned of potential blowback. “This strike doesn't represent strength. It's not sound foreign policy. It puts Americans at risk in Venezuela and the region, and it sends a horrible and disturbing signal to other powerful leaders across the globe that targeting a head of state is an acceptable policy for the U.S. government,” he said.

CNN reports that the Senate Armed Services Committee wasn't notified of the strikes or Maduro's reported kidnapping ahead of time. Some lawmakers have tried, in recent months, to assert Congress's war power authority to prevent further military actions against Venezuela, but these attempts have failed in the Republican-controlled chambers. The campaign has otherwise been marked by an unusual level of secrecy from the administration, members of Congress have said.

Legal experts have condemned the strikes as illegal under domestic and international law.

“I condemn the U.S.'s illegal aggression against Venezuela & the illegal abduction of its leader & his wife,” said Ben Saul, UN special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism. “Every Venezuelan life lost is a violation of the right to life. President Trump should be impeached & investigated for the alleged killings.”

“Donald Trump has launched an illegal and reckless regime change operation in Venezuela,” said Matt Duss, executive vice president of the Center for International Policy, in a statement. He called on Congress to take action against further strikes and hostilities.

“Trump was elected on a promise to end wars, not start them,” Duss went on. “His illegal aggression against Venezuela once again breaks that promise, and threatens to repeat some of the worst moral and strategic failures of past U.S. military adventurism, for which the American people and communities around the world have paid enormous costs.” 

The morning of the raid, the White House announced Trump would hold an address at 11 a.m. at Mar-a-Lago. However, he was more than half an hour to make his first public address, instead posting a video of footage that appeared to be from the military strikes set to Creedence Clearwater Revival's “Fortunate Son,” as well as a supposed picture of Maduro onboard the USS Iwo Jima, on Truth Social.

More than 64,000 children in Gaza have reportedly been killed or maimed since 2023. Many who survived are now orphans.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

Israel's genocidal war has destroyed families and livelihoods across Gaza, leaving more than 39,000 children orphaned, while the widespread destruction has deprived over 80 percent of the workforce of their sources of income. Amid deepening poverty and the absence of alternatives, an increasing number of children have been forced into the streets, resorting to begging as their only means of survival.

Some estimates indicate that hundreds of children in Gaza currently engage in street begging, a direct reflection of economic collapse, the loss of breadwinners, and weak social protection networks, amid the ongoing war and the destruction it has wreaked on families and the economic infrastructure alike.

In Al-Maghazi refugee camp I met 11-year-old Ahmed, who lost his home in northern Gaza after it was completely bombed. The house was part of the land seized by the occupation, preventing his family from erecting their tent in the original location of their home, forcing them to move to the southern part of the territory.

Ahmed has now become the sole provider for his small family after his father was killed in July while going to collect U.S.-backed humanitarian aid. He stood in one of the camp's streets on the day I met him, begging passersby as rain fell and his feet remained bare. When asked why he was on the street, he quietly told me: “I need three shekels to buy a loaf of bread.”

His sad gaze and young age reflect a harsh reality in which children are forced to beg to meet their families' basic needs after losing their breadwinner and witnessing most of their families' sources of income destroyed by the war.

During our conversation, Ahmed showed visible frustration when asked why he was on the street. He said, in a childlike tone of anger: “Why do I have to go out asking for shekels when I'm supposed to be studying and playing like other kids?” This candid response reflects his sense of frustration and anger at the situation imposed on his small life — a feeling shared by many children in the camps who have had to shoulder responsibilities for which they are far too young.

At the bus stop, my attention was drawn to 8-year-old Noor, whose sadness was immediately apparent. She lost her parents in an Israeli airstrike that destroyed their home, and after their death and the loss of her siblings, Noor now lives with her uncle under extremely difficult circumstances.

Amid deepening poverty and the absence of alternatives, an increasing number of children have been forced into the streets, resorting to begging as their only means of survival.

Her clothes were tattered, and she wasn't wearing a jacket despite the rainy weather. Noor explains that any funds she receives are saved to invest in small projects, such as selling water bottles to passersby, to help her uncle and provide for the family — a clear example of child labor prompted by war and poverty.

Noor's uncle, a married man with a family of seven, lost his source of income during the war and now lives with his entire family in a small tent within the camp. Despite his own family's hardships, he took on the responsibility of caring for 8-year-old Noor after her parents and siblings were killed in the bombing.

He described daily life for the family: “We live on aid, but it's never enough to cover our basic needs. My seven children need food and clothing, and Noor needs care, and I can't provide everything.”

He added about Noor's role: “Any money she earns from begging or selling small items is saved to help the family. Sometimes she sells water bottles or anything small she can manage. This is the only way we can survive.”

He continued: “Noor is very young, yet she has become the family's small provider. Every day brings new challenges — rain, a cramped tent, limited hope — but she tries to contribute in any way she can.”

This testimony illustrates the daily suffering of children who have lost their caregivers and the role of relatives who attempt to fill the gap, despite their own difficult circumstances. It also highlights how children like Noor are forced to take on responsibilities far beyond their age due the destruction of Gaza's economy and the mass murder of their guardians.

“Many of these children don't know what it means to play or study. Their lives are focused solely on survival.”

Children like Ahmed and Noor were supposed to be in school, attending lessons in a safe and stable environment. Before the war, Gaza had approximately 625,000 students with over 22,000 teachers, achieving high rates of 95 percent enrollment in primary education and 90 percent enrollment in secondary education, and a literacy rate of 97 percent, which is among the highest globally.

Amid the genocide, many schools were damaged or used as temporary shelters for displaced families, leading to a halt in regular education. Thousands of children lost access to schooling, directly affecting their academic achievement and daily routines. For Ahmed, being out of school means he is forced to beg to provide for his family, while missing even the most basic lessons, such as learning letters and numbers.

The damage that this unprecedented education loss has caused the children of Gaza is not limited to schooling; it also has long-term implications for their future and their ability to escape poverty.

Amid the narrow tents and muddy streets, the daily reality of children in the camps comes into focus. In every corner, children stand waiting for passersby, wearing tattered clothes and mostly barefoot, trying to obtain a small amount of money for food or other basic needs.

Samia, a resident of the camp who has witnessed the children begging, told me, “Many of these children don't know what it means to play or study. Their lives are focused solely on survival. Even the simplest things, like buying a loaf of bread or a bottle of water, have become a daily struggle.”

These recurring scenes in the camps reflect the scale of the crisis facing children in Gaza, where so many have lost their families, their homes, and their basic means of survival. For some, the streets have become a temporary solution to meet daily needs, robbing them of their childhoods.

The impact of begging is not limited to the loss of childhood; it also exposes children to exploitation, harsh labor, illiteracy, and psychological trauma that can have long-lasting effects. As the number of children forced into street begging increases, their opportunities for a normal and secure life diminish. Homes and infrastructure can be rebuilt, but a generation deprived of education and hope for the future cannot be restored as easily.

The international community has been aware of what has been happening in Gaza over the past two years, but has consistently failed to act to protect Palestinians. Human rights organizations stress the urgent need to intervene and ensure children's rights in accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the right to food and water, health care, education, a safe environment, and protection from violence and abuse. Immediate action is required to reduce the daily risks faced by Gaza's children. Global inaction allows their suffering to continue.

            The flames of Le Constellation touched far too many young people on New Year's Eve.
    


            Even so, the scars of that night already run much wider than the bar.
    


            In the days since the blaze, locals told CNN they were lost in the what ifs of that night: last-minute changes of plans, choosing to celebrate outside the crowded bar or with family instead of friends.
    


            “It should've been us”; “I was supposed to go too”; “My siblings were there the night before,” locals told us in the days after the fire.
    


            Now, those who were texting with presumed victims just hours before the disaster are glued to their phones: locked in a desperate wait for any information about friends who simply don't reply any more.
    


            On Saturday, Swiss police announced they had opened an investigation into the managers of the bar for negligent manslaughter, negligent bodily harm and negligent arson.
    


            Swiss police also identified four of the victims including two young women, aged 21 and 16, and two young men, 18 and 16.
    


            In a bar popular with teenagers, there's a growing realisation realization in Crans-Montana that many of the dead are some of the youngest in this community of locals and holidaymakers.
    


            For their friends – children themselves – the events of that night, beamed around social networks via horrifying videos of fiery panic, are all they talk about.
    


            “We ask what we would have done in their place,” 17-year-old Leonor Marques told CNN. “We only speak of that.”
    


            “I feel like even if we want to turn the page it's impossible,” she said, “The subject comes around and around.”
    


            Friday morning, as journalists and mourners gathered before Le Constellation, one scene captured the raw emotion still coursing through this small community.
    


            A father, his face soaked with tears, crumpled to his knees as he neared the bar.
    


            After a desperate scrabble for information, through two dark nights and a difficult day, he still didn't know if his son's body may lie in Le Constellation, his brother told CNN.
    


            According to Swiss officials, a handful of patients in hospital from the fire have still not yet been identified.
    


            Amid the unbearable wait for information, the days swing between hope and despair, the teenage cousin of one young man still missing since the fire said.
    


            “I mean, there's probably no chance” he's alive, she told CNN after nearly two full days of no news of his fate. She asked to remain anonymous out of respect for her family.
    


            For Leonor Marques, 17, who is still waiting on news of two friends she knew were at Le Constellation on Wednesday night, not knowing their fate is the most difficult.
    


            “I feel useless like I can do nothing,” she told CNN from Crans-Montana, “I don't know if they're alive dead, doing well or badly. I can't do anything. I can do absolutely nothing.”
    


            Amid the tragedy, she said she had to take took some comfort in knowing that two of her friends were in medically induced comas in a Lausanne hospital.
    


            “That's something,” she said.
    


            Surgical resident Amandine Chavanon, 25, holidaying in Crans-Montana was woken by her mother after her teenage brother called them from outside Le Constellation.
    


            Rushing to the scene to help, she spent hours triaging badly burned victims, offering life-saving aid alongside first responders and passersby.
    


            Focused on treating patients on the floor of the bank where she was inserting IV drips and calming burned survivors, identifying them wasn't their priority.
    


            “Evacuate, evacuate, evacuate” was what we were thinking, she told CNN, even as some of the first responders tried to keep track of the names of the dozens of wounded teenagers.
    


            Stumbling out of the bar, she said many of the young revellers, “didn't really know what's happening.”
    


            “I had a girl. I remember she was – the whole face was burnt, and she saw me, and she said, ‘I'm going home.' I just took her, and I said, ‘You're not going home.'”
    


            Working a New Year's Eve nightshift at a nearby hospital, doctor friends recounted to Chavanon having to turn away distraught parents looking for their children as they struggled to deal with the influx of patients.
    


            “It was just saving, saving, saving,” she said.
    


            As pictures emerged from the last moments in Le Constellation before the fire took hold, revellers can be seen dancing beneath a shower of sparks, flying out of champagne bottles lifted inches from the ceiling, coated in insulation foam.
    


            In video shot likely moments later, young people dance, laugh and film the flames as a young man bats in vain at the flames with a towel.
    


            With authorities directing their ongoing investigation at the role of the sparklers, testimony from survivors and those that rushed to help is beginning to fill in the picture of that fateful night.
    


            Paolo Campolo, a local resident being hailed for pulling revellers out of the burning bar, said that he had to force a rear door of the bar to free people trapped inside.
    


            Multiple teenagers CNN spoke to following the fire, who said they had visited Le Constellation many times, said and that a rear exit to the bar was usually locked.
    


            The French co-owner of the bar told Swiss newspaper Tribune de Genève Friday that the establishment had been inspected “three times in 10 years.”
    


            “Everything was done according to the rules,” Jacques Moretti he said.
    


            CNN previously reached out to both Moretti and co-owner Jessica Anne Jeanne Moretti through their businesses.
    


            In Crans-Montana, news of the living and the dead feels like the priority for many.
    


            Processing this disaster is not yet on people's minds.
    


            On Thursday evening, a father walked past the shrouded fences that now mark Le Constellation, his toddler perched on his shoulders.
    


            “What happened there?” she asked him, his face contorting as he searched for his reply, the weight of the tragedy too much to distil.
    


            “An accident, my dear,” he answered.

            On a Saturday morning in October, Park Jihyun woke up at 5:30 a.m. to go raving in Seoul.
    


            And much about her prep routine was counterintuitive.
    


            Instead of shimmying into a miniskirt, the 29-year-old pulled on a pair of running tights. Instead of slipping her feet into a set of precarious heels, she slipped into running shoes. And in lieu of hailing a cab to the party, she ran from her apartment to the venue in Yongsan-gu, arriving after an hour-long, 5-mile jog, ready to hit the dance floor.
    


            “It's just random people who meet for the first time. But as we start dancing together, it becomes crazier as time flies,” Park says.
    


            Since launching in May, the Seoul Morning Coffee Club's Coffee Rave has become a viral success, drawing hundreds of like-minded Seoulites from the comfort of their beds to dance at daybreak.
    


            Attendees, who have paid 20,000 won (about $14) for their ticket, start trickling in at 7 a.m., and line up for their drink of choice, often an iced Americano or a matcha. By 8 a.m., the DJ is pumping out hypnotic bass beats for an enthusiastic crowd of revelers who are jumping in unison in the clear, bright light of day, with nothing but caffeine to fuel their booze-free rave.
    


            “It's a fresh start to the day,” founder Park Jae-hyun (no relation to Park Jihyun) tells CNN. “Even though it's very early in the morning, everyone looks excited and happy, even without alcohol.”
    


            The concept of sober raves is not new. New York-based outfit Daybreaker and Morning Gloryville in London have been throwing these kinds of raves for more than a decade.
    


            But in recent years, the latest sub-genre of booze-free events has moved into community spaces like coffee shops and bakeries in major cities around the world, flipping the script on the traditional clubbing scene.
    


            From Brisbane to Mumbai, and Paris to Toronto, the movement has quickly gained traction among a segment of Gen Z-ers and younger Millennials who are drinking less and prioritizing sleep, health and wellness in their lives.
    


            Interestingly, however, one of the pioneers of the concept in France says this wasn't his goal when he launched his first bakery rave in Paris back in 2019.
    


            While living and working in cities like Miami and Los Angeles as a French DJ and music producer, Alexis Duvivier, better known as Aazar, said one of the things he missed most about home was French boulangeries, or bakeries.
    


            “It was such a big part of my culture in my everyday life here in France,” Duvivier said during an interview at a coffee shop in Paris. “It was the first thing I wanted to do when I went back or when I was there. I was always on the lookout for the best baguette or the best pain au chocolat. It's always been my personal little quest.”
    


            So when it came time to celebrate the release of his single “Diva” in 2019, Duvivier, 36, wanted to create a free event for his fans, merging his two passions — music and baked goods. He hosted his first early evening rave at The French Bastards in the 11th arrondissement, which had opened a year earlier and quickly distinguished itself from other bakeries for its irreverent and innovative menu.
    


            As Aazar spun for the crowds against a backdrop of baguettes, trays of free pastries were distributed to the revelers, making for fun, unusual visuals on social media.
    


            This year, clips of DJs Bob Sinclair and Peggy Gou playing for excited crowds also went viral, making The French Bastards one of the most unlikely rave hot spots in the French capital.
    


            But Duvivier says the concept was highly personal and was never intended to become a gimmicky social media trend.
    


            “I didn't choose a bakery because I was looking for an unusual location, but because for me it represents France and represents what I love,” said Duvivier, who also hosts events across Europe as Bakery Session.
    


            However, in the years since, the movement has grown bigger than Duvivier's initial intent, circling the globe and gaining momentum, as it reflects shifting global trends and responds to a set of unmet needs.
    


            “In Korea, there's a lot of competition and mental illness in society,” says Park, the Seoul Morning Coffee Club (SMCC) founder. “I want to help Koreans have a freer life … tell them to calm down, relax, take it easy and that everything is going to be fine.”
    


            While South Korea is not unique in dealing with the issue of deteriorating mental health, burnout and a loneliness epidemic in this fragmented, digital age, suffering is particularly acute in this country.
    


            The suicide rate in South Korea is highest among the countries tracked by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) at 23 suicides per 100,000 people in 2023 – more than double the OECD average. And it's a troubling title the country has held for more than a decade.
    


            In a country notorious for its hyper-competitive, status-centered social structure, work-life balance in South Korea can be difficult to manage, with long work hours and a cutthroat job market.
    


            But in recent years, younger generations have been increasingly rejecting the status quo, prioritizing their wellness and seeking community in offline events like those organized by the Seoul Morning Coffee Club (the group also hosts morning runs, book clubs and coffee chats) that allow them to blow off steam and boost their mental health.
    


            “Compared to other countries, a lot of Korean people are very self-conscious,” says Park Jihyun, who also volunteers as a coffee chat host. “But the coffee rave lets you be yourself and helps introverts and those who are self-conscious grow out of their shell.”
    


            While Seoul is known for its thrumming nightlife, the raves also cater to an underserved demographic in the city: morning people. And within this group, many tend to lead healthy, booze-free lifestyles, which can be isolating in a drinking culture where professional and personal relationships are often forged over a night of heavy drinking.
    


            For British content creator Freya Hawksley, 23, who has been living in Seoul for the past five years, the event is a win-win, both as a morning person and non-drinker.
    


            “When you're partying and drinking, your energy levels start really high and then deplete throughout the night,” Hawksley says. “But when you go to these morning parties, you actually gain energy. So you turn up to these raves at 7 a.m., you finish at 10 a.m., and you feel completely energized and ready for the day.”
    


            Seoul raves are also safe spaces: wholesome, family-friendly and multi-generational raves with babies and tots bopping to EDM alongside older adults.
    


            “As a woman, I feel so much safer,” she added.
    


            Hawksley was invited to the launch event as a friend of the organizers but has since returned on her own.
    


            It's a similar story in London, where DJs Manpal Bhullar (Mezz B), 32, and Vishal Kamle (Chndra), 31, brought sober, daytime raves to coffee shops earlier this year.
    


            “I'm at that age where I don't want to be out until the early morning, drinking and clubbing,” Kamle says. “It's built around us in a way, reflecting our era.”
    


            It's a surprising admission for the duo, who are used to playing late-night clubs as Lost in Kaydnce. But the founders of Coffee Gen say that London nightlife has changed over the years, becoming too commercialized, impersonal and prohibitively expensive.
    


            That disillusionment is shared by many young Britons. According to a 2025 consumer report from Night Time Industries Association UK published in February, 61% of the 2,000 respondents aged 18-30 reported going out less frequently in the last year, citing financial pressures, safety concerns and transportation barriers.
    


            The group has also warned that 40% of the UK's nightlife businesses faced closures without government intervention.
    


            Matthew Campoli, co-founder of The Coffee Party in Toronto, also points out that the new genre of sober raves has succeeded in shaking up a stale and stagnant nightlife scene that lost part of its luster after the pandemic.
    


            “I think there's a need for genuine connection again. Since the pandemic, there's been a gap. Social anxieties have developed and routines were crushed, and a lot of people started to prioritize themselves during that time which is why interests have shifted.”
    


            For Franklin Vaz, 33, the arrival of sober coffee raves in Toronto earlier this year aligned with his own lifestyle changes, as he had decided to quit alcohol altogether.
    


            But he still loved music. When one of his DJ friends who was spinning at a Coffee Party event told him about the gathering, Vaz jumped at the idea of joining like-minded people. He had no expectations, he says, and went to support his friend.
    


            While waiting to get his drink, however, Vaz became instantly smitten by the “radiant” face of a woman who was also waiting in line and struck up conversation. Turned out that both were avid runners and led clean lifestyles: two days later, they went on their first date where they ran the distance of a half marathon, 13 miles, together.
    


            “The conversation just flowed, so it was very exciting and very organic,” he says of meeting his now girlfriend.
    


            After attending the events as a guest, Vaz now works as an event helper at The Coffee Party.
    


            “The events are very motivating,” he adds. “The people there want to be the best versions of themselves. So it's pushed me to be the best version of myself too.”

            President Donald Trump wants to tamp down on public debates about his health.
    


            The oldest president to assume office has been dogged by questions about recent doctors' visits, bruises on his hands and whether he's fallen asleep during public events.
    


            Trump dismissed these concerns in an apparently impromptu interview with the Wall Street Journal this week, in which he blamed the visible bruises on a high daily dose of aspirin — more than his doctors recommend — and said he has plenty of energy.
    


            The president, who for years criticized former President Joe Biden's age and cognitive health, followed up Friday with a Truth Social post saying he had aced his “third straight” cognitive test.
    


            But the disclosures have done little to quell reemerging scrutiny of his health.
    


            In fact, here are five questions his most recent health disclosures have raised.
    


            The physician overseeing Trump's care and the recent pronouncement of exceptional health is Dr. Sean Barbabella, a Navy captain who was named to the role in March. Barbabella specialized in combat trauma and emergency care while in the military. He has defended Trump's recent advance medical imaging and a semiannual physical this year as routine screening and care.
    


            He is the latest in a line of personal physicians who have praised Trump's physical health and cognition.
    


            When Trump entered his first term, he kept on Dr. Ronny Jackson, who had served as President Barack Obama's personal physician and grew to be one of Trump's close personal advisers after a glowing news conference about the then-45th president's “incredible genes.”
    


            Jackson stepped down from his White House role in March 2018 when Trump nominated him to lead the Veterans Affairs Department. But he withdrew his nomination a month later amid allegations about his professional conduct while in the White House. He now serves in the House of Representatives as a Republican from Texas.
    


            Jackson was followed by Dr. Sean Conley, a Navy emergency physician who in 2019 said that Trump was “in very good health” and that he expected the president “will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond.”
    


            During the Covid-19 pandemic, Conley prescribed hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that had gained popularity among conservatives as an alternative — though unproven— therapy to aid against infection from the virus, as a preventive measure for Trump. In October 2020, when Trump contracted Covid-19, Conley oversaw his treatment.
    


            The White House physicians were preceded by Dr. Harold Bornstein, Trump's longtime personal physician in New York City. During his first presidential campaign, Bornstein proclaimed in an effusive letter that Trump “will be healthiest individual ever elected” president.
    


            Bornstein later claimed that Trump dictated that letter to him over the phone. After the election, he said Trump officials raided his office for the president's personal medical records, an account disputed by administration officials who said it was a routine handover of his private records.
    


            Bornstein told The New York Times at the time that the encounter took place two days after a February 2017 interview in which he told NBC News that the president takes Propecia, a prostate drug often prescribed for hair loss.
    


            The president said he takes a higher dose of aspirin than recommended by his doctors because “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart.” He blamed that high dose for the visible bruises on his hands in recent months.
    


            Aspirin used to be widely prescribed as a preventative for cardiovascular disease, but that has shifted. In 2019, medical experts advised against routine aspirin use unless a person has a heart condition or other health risks, citing the heightened risk of internal bleeding.
    


            When they do recommend preventive aspirin, doctors typically advise an 81 milligram dose, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. Trump told the Journal that he takes 325 milligram daily – about four times as much – and Barbabella said he is using it for cardiac prevention.
    


            “Low-dose aspirin is 81 milligrams once a day, and full-dose is 325 milligrams once a day,” said Dr. Fahmi Farah, an invasive cardiologist and medical director and CEO of Bentley Heart in Fort Worth, Texas.
    


            “Typically speaking, we do not recommend the full-dose aspirin. The full-dose aspirin has a lot more risk factors associated with it, and for the most part, those are GI risk factors. People who take full-dose aspirin are more prone to having GI bleeding, especially if they have ulcers and things like that,” Farah said. “The people we usually reserve the full-dose aspirin for are those who have serious conditions, like they have heart disease, or they have diagnosed atrial fibrillation, and they cannot be on a stronger blood thinner.”
    


            The White House has said the president has chronic venous insufficiency, a condition that can cause blood to pool in the veins, inducing swelling and aches in the lower legs. It is a common condition, particularly as people age, and can be worsened by lack of physical activity. In some cases, aspirin may also be used to help treat the condition.
    


            Freeman and the other doctors who spoke to CNN have not treated the president and do not have direct insight into his health.
    


            But “many cardiologists would question” a long-term high-dose regimen, “given increased bleeding risk,” said Dr. Vivek Cherian, a Chicago-based internal medicine physician.
    


            In a statement to CNN, Barbabella asserted that “President Trump's medical evaluations and laboratory results continue to show excellent metabolic health, and have revealed his cardiovascular health puts him 14 years younger than his age.”
    


            “Overall, the President remains in exceptional health and perfectly suited to execute his duties as Commander in Chief,” he said.
    


            Trump's interview with the Journal shed some more light on what the White House has called the “advanced imaging” he underwent in October. The president had told reporters that it was an MRI — a lengthier, more intensive scan focused on soft tissue — and was part of his routine physical. However, Trump told the Journal that he had a CT scan.
    


            Barbabella told CNN that both options, an MRI and a CT scan, were on the table “to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.” A CT scan was done, he said, and “was perfectly normal and revealed absolutely no abnormalities.”
    


            A cardiovascular CT scan is typically used to estimate long-term heart attack risk or rule out significant blockages, said Cherian, the Chicago-based internal medicine physician.
    


            “Bottom line, CT scans don't ‘prove' your heart is safe, but they can refine risk, guide prevention, reassure when normal and escalate care when abnormal,” Cherian told CNN in an email.
    


            In the new interview, Trump expressed regret about disclosing the scan in the first place. “In retrospect, it's too bad I took it because it gave them a little ammunition,” he told the Journal.
    


            Trump has been adamant for years that presidential and vice presidential candidates should undergo “cognitive assessments.” The president renewed this call Friday in a Truth Social post declaring that he had scored “100%” on his third cognitive test.
    


            “I strongly believe that anyone running for President, or Vice President, should be mandatorily forced to take a strong, meaningful, and proven Cognitive Examination,” he wrote.
    


            It is not clear what test he was referring to in his post, and the White House did not immediately return a request for comment. But in 2018, Trump took the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a 10-minute screening test used to detect mild cognitive impairment and early dementia.
    


            He took the test again in April 2025, reportedly scoring 30 out of 30.
    


            According to Cherian, “a normal or high score means no obvious cognitive impairment was detected,” he said. “It's important to note that the MoCA is not an IQ test and does not measure intelligence, judgment, decision-making, or overall cognitive fitness.”
    


            That Trump took to social media even after speaking to the Journal reflects his longtime defensiveness about his cognitive health – a point on which he often attacked his predecessor on the 2024 campaign trail.
    


            Trump “has nothing to hide, unlike his predecessor Joe Biden, who hid from the press and lied about his clear physical and mental decline,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.
    


            The president also told the Journal that he gets little sleep, finds most exercise boring and has not made changes to his diet, which has favored fast food such as McDonald's burgers and Filet-O-Fish.
    


            Farah, the invasive cardiologist in Fort Worth, found the details about sleep “alarming.”
    


            “It could be something as simple as sleep deprivation, but it could be something more serious,” she said. “It can have a lot of other effects on your overall health, especially your cardiovascular health. It can increase the risk of heart attack, arrhythmia, stroke, all of those things.”
    


            Trump attributes his health to “very good genetics.” But experts say this is just one piece of the puzzle, particularly as people age.
    


            “Your genes are part of the equation, for sure, but it's the environment you put them in,” including diet and exercise, said Freeman. “If we were honest and open about this in a more explicit way, we might actually be able to solve the problem of the American health crisis.”
    


            That message is the crux of the “Make America Healthy Again” agenda spearheaded by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Freeman pointed out.
    


            Kennedy “is trying his best to move the needle on nutrition, but it seems like the president doesn't seem to resonate with any of those things,” Freeman said. “It's a very interesting time where politics and health are crossing in ways that you never anticipate.”

SPRING CITY, Pa. (AP) — Tech companies and developers looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly losing fights in communities where people don't want to live next to them, or even near them.

Communities across the United States are reading about — and learning from — each other's battles against data center proposals that are fast multiplying in number and size to meet steep demand as developers branch out in search of faster connections to power sources.

In many cases, municipal boards are trying to figure out whether energy- and water-hungry data centers fit into their zoning framework. Some have entertained waivers or tried to write new ordinances. Some don't have zoning. 

But as more people hear about a data center coming to their community, once-sleepy municipal board meetings in farming towns and growing suburbs now feature crowded rooms of angry residents pressuring local officials to reject the requests.

“Would you want this built in your backyard?” Larry Shank asked supervisors last month in Pennsylvania's East Vincent Township. “Because that's where it's literally going, is in my backyard.”




A growing number of proposals are going down in defeat, sounding alarms across the data center constellation of Big Tech firms, real estate developers, electric utilities, labor unions and more. 

Andy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL, counted seven or eight deals he'd worked on in recent months that saw opponents going door-to-door, handing out shirts or putting signs in people's yards.

“It's becoming a huge problem,” Cvengros said.

Data Center Watch, a project of 10a Labs, an AI security consultancy, said it is seeing a sharp escalation in community, political and regulatory disruptions to data center development. 

Between April and June alone, its latest reporting period, it counted 20 proposals valued at $98 billion in 11 states that were blocked or delayed amid local opposition and state-level pushback. That amounts to two-thirds of the projects it was tracking.

Some environmental and consumer advocacy groups say they're fielding calls every day, and are working to educate communities on how to protect themselves.

“I've been doing this work for 16 years, worked on hundreds of campaigns I'd guess, and this by far is the biggest kind of local pushback I've ever seen here in Indiana,” said Bryce Gustafson of the Indianapolis-based Citizens Action Coalition.

In Indiana alone, Gustafson counted more than a dozen projects that lost rezoning petitions.

For some people angry over steep increases in electric bills, their patience is thin for data centers that could bring still-higher increases. 

Losing open space, farmland, forest or rural character is a big concern. So is the damage to quality of life, property values or health by on-site diesel generators kicking on or the constant hum of servers. Others worry that wells and aquifers could run dry.

Lawsuits are flying — both ways — over whether local governments violated their own rules.

Big Tech firms Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook — which are collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers across the globe — didn't answer Associated Press questions about the effect of community pushback.

Microsoft, however, has acknowledged the difficulties. In an October securities filing, it listed its operational risks as including “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development.”

Even with high-level support from state and federal governments, the pushback is having an impact.

Maxx Kossof, vice president of investment at Chicago-based developer The Missner Group, said developers worried about losing a zoning fight are considering selling properties once they secure a power source — a highly sought-after commodity that makes a proposal far more viable and valuable.

“You might as well take chips off the table,” Kossof said. “The thing is you could have power to a site and it's futile because you might not get the zoning. You might not get the community support.”

Some in the industry are frustrated, saying opponents are spreading falsehoods about data centers — such as polluting water and air — and are difficult to overcome.

Still, data center allies say they are urging developers to engage with the public earlier in the process, emphasize economic benefits, sow good will by supporting community initiatives and talk up efforts to conserve water and power and protect ratepayers.

“It's definitely a discussion that the industry is having internally about, ‘Hey, how do we do a better job of community engagement?'” said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition, a trade association that includes Big Tech firms and developers.

Winning over local officials, however, hasn't translated to winning over residents.

Developers pulled a project off an October agenda in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina, after Mayor John Higdon said he informed them it faced unanimous defeat.

The project would have funded half the city's budget and developers promised environmentally friendly features. But town meetings overflowed, and emails, texts and phone calls were overwhelmingly opposed, “999 to one against,” Higdon said.

Had council approved it, “every person that voted for it would no longer be in office,” the mayor said. “That's for sure.”

In Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, a proposed data center campus several times larger than the Mall of America is on hold amid challenges over whether the city's environmental review was adequate.

Residents found each other through social media and, from there, learned to organize, protest, door-knock and get their message out.

They say they felt betrayed and lied to when they discovered that state, county, city and utility officials knew about the proposal for an entire year before the city — responding to a public records request filed by the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy — released internal emails that confirmed it.

“It's the secrecy. The secrecy just drives people crazy,” said Jonathan Thornton, a realtor who lives across a road from the site.

Documents revealing the extent of the project emerged days before a city rezoning vote in October. Mortenson, which is developing it for a Fortune 50 company that it hasn't named, says it is considering changes based on public feedback and that “more engagement with the community is appropriate.”

Rebecca Gramdorf found out about it from a Duluth newspaper article, and immediately worried that it would spell the end of her six-acre vegetable farm.

She found other opponents online, ordered 100 yard signs and prepared for a struggle.

“I don't think this fight is over at all,” Gramdorf said.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The United States captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and flew him out of the country in an extraordinary military operation early Saturday that plucked a sitting leader from office. President Donald Trump insisted the U.S. government would run the country at least temporarily and would tap Venezuelan's vast oil reserves to sell “large amounts” to other countries.

The action marked the culmination of an escalating Trump administration pressure campaign on the South American country that consisted of months of strikes on boats officials said were smuggling drugs to the U.S. Behind the scenes, U.S. officials tracked Maduro's behavioral habits, including what he ate and where he slept, in preparing to execute an operation that resulted in one of the more stunning regime changes in modern history.

Maduro and his wife, seized overnight from their home on a military base, were aboard a U.S. warship on their way to New York, where they were to face criminal charges in connection with a Justice Department indictment accusing them of a role in narco-terrorism conspiracy. 




Trump said the U.S. planned to run Venezuela until a transition of power can take place. He claimed the American presence was already in place, though there were no immediate signs the U.S. was running the country. Venezuelan state TV continued to air pro-Maduro propaganda, broadcasting live images of supporters taking to the streets in Caracas in protest.

“We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago news conference where he boasted that this “extremely successful operation should serve as warning to anyone who would threaten American sovereignty or endanger American lives.”




The legal authority for the attack, which echoed the 1990 U.S. invasion of Panama that led to the surrender and seizure of leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, was not immediately clear. The U.S. government does not recognize Maduro, who last appeared on state television Friday while meeting with a delegation of Chinese officials in Caracas.

Maduro and other Venezuelan officials were indicted in 2020 on “narco-terrorism” conspiracy charges, but the Justice Department released a new indictment Saturday of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores that described the regime as a “corrupt, illegitimate government” fueled by a drug trafficking operation that flooded the U.S with cocaine.

Trump posted on his Truth Social account a photo that he said showed Maduro in custody, including blindfolded and in a sweatsuit.

Early Saturday, multiple explosions rang out and low-flying aircraft swept through the Venezuelan capital. Maduro's government accused the United States of attacking civilian and military installations, calling it an “imperialist attack” and urging citizens to take to the streets.

The attack lasted less than 30 minutes and the explosions — at least seven blasts — sent people rushing into the streets, while others took to social media to report what they'd seen and heard. Some Venezuelan civilians and members of the military were killed, said Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, without giving a number. Trump said some U.S. forces were injured in Venezuela but none were killed.

“We think, we develop, we train, we rehearse, we debrief, we rehearse again, and again. not to get it right, but to ensure we cannot get it wrong,” said Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Video obtained from Caracas and an unidentified coastal city showed tracers and smoke clouding the landscape as repeated muted explosions illuminated the night sky. Other footage showed cars passing on a highway as blasts illuminated the hills behind them. The videos were verified by The Associated Press.

Smoke was seen rising from the hangar of a military base in Caracas, while another military installation in the capital was without power.

Venezuelan ruling party leader Nahum Fernández told The Associated Press that Maduro and Flores were at their home within the Ft. Tiuna military installation when they were captured.

“That's where they bombed,” he said. “And, there, they carried out what we could call a kidnapping of the president and the first lady of the country.”

Under Venezuelan law, Rodríguez would take over from Maduro. There was no confirmation that had happened, though she did issue a statement after the strike, demanding proof of life for Maduro and his wife.

The strike followed a months-long Trump administration pressure campaign on the Venezuelan leader, including a major buildup of American forces in the waters off South America and attacks on boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean accused of carrying drugs. Last week, the CIA was behind a drone strike at a docking area believed to have been used by Venezuelan drug cartels — the first known direct operation on Venezuelan soil since the U.S. began strikes in September.

As of Friday, the number of known boat strikes was 35 and the number of people killed at least 115, according to the Trump administration. Trump said that the U.S. is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels and has justified the boat strikes as a necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the U.S.

Maduro has decried the U.S. military operations as a thinly veiled effort to oust him from power.

Venezuela's ruling party has held power since 1999, when Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chávez took office, promising to uplift poor people and later to implement a self-described socialist revolution. 

Maduro took over when Chávez died in 2013. His 2018 reelection was widely considered a sham because the main opposition parties were banned from participating. During the 2024 election, ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared him the winner hours after polls closed, but the opposition gathered overwhelming evidence that he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin.

In a demonstration of how polarizing a figure Maduro is, people variously took to the streets to deplore his capture and celebrate it.

At a protest in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas Mayor Carmen Meléndez joined a crowd demanding Maduro's return.

“Maduro, hold on, the people are rising up!” the crowd chanted. “We are here Nicolás Maduro. If you can hear us, we are here!”

Earlier, armed people and uniformed members of a civilian militia took to the streets of a Caracas neighborhood long considered a stronghold of the ruling party.

In other parts of the city, the streets remained empty hours after the attack, as residents absorbed events. Some areas remained without power, but vehicles moved freely.

“How do I feel? Scared, like everyone,” said Caracas resident Noris Prada, who sat on an empty avenue looking down at his phone. “Venezuelans woke up scared, many families couldn't sleep.”

In the Chilean capital of Santiago, people waved Venezuelan flags and banging pots and pans as vehicles passed by honking at them.

In Doral, Florida, home to the largest Venezuelan community in the U.S, people wrapped themselves in Venezuelan flags, ate fried snacks and cheered as music played. At one point, the crowd chanted “Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!”

The Armed Services committees in both houses of Congress, which have jurisdiction over military matters, have not been notified by the administration of any actions, according to a person familiar with the matter and granted anonymity to discuss it.

Lawmakers from both political parties in Congress have raised deep reservations and flat-out objections to the U.S. attacks on boats suspected of drug smuggling near the Venezuelan coast and Congress has not specifically approved an authorization for the use of military force for such operations in the region.

Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he had seen no evidence that would justify Trump striking Venezuela without approval from Congress and demanded an immediate briefing by the administration on “its plan to ensure stability in the region and its legal justification for this decision.”

Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said the military action and seizure of Maduro marks “a new dawn for Venezuela,” saying that “the tyrant is gone.” He posted on X hours after the strike. His boss, Rubio, reposted a post from July that said Maduro “is NOT the President of Venezuela and his regime is NOT the legitimate government.”

Cuba, a supporter of the Maduro government and a longtime adversary of the United States, called for the international community to respond to what President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez called “the criminal attack.” 

“Our zone of peace is being brutally assaulted,” he said on X. Iran's Foreign Ministry also condemned the strikes.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Four years after showing up late for the Beijing Olympics and missing one of his races because of a case of COVID-19, U.S. long track speedskater Casey Dawson is enjoying what he jokingly terms his “villain arc,” peaking at the right time ahead of the Milan Cortina Games.

Dawson secured a spot for next month in the men's 5,000 meters — an event he was forced to skip in 2022 while sick — by winning at that distance at the U.S. Olympic trials in 6 minutes, 12.857 seconds on Friday night.

“I actually got COVID two or three weeks before going to the competition. Tested positive for 50 straight tests,” said Dawson, a 25-year-old from Park City, Utah. “Couldn't go over to the Games. I missed the opening ceremonies. Missed the 5,000 meters. Showed up 12 hours before my 1,500 meters. So I kind of got a little screwed over from that point of view. But this time around, I'm just looking forward to getting there smoothly and just getting a little bit of redemption.”

And then, with a chuckle, Dawson added: “It's kind of fun to have, like, my villain arc, I would call it. Just coming back and having some fun.”

Ethan Cepuran was about 6 1/2 seconds back Friday, finishing next in 6:19.335.

The last American man to medal in the 5,000 at an Olympics was Chad Hedrick at the 2006 Turin Games.

Dawson already had secured the lone U.S. place for Milan in the men's 10,000 — a race not being contested at these trials — and also will be part of the trio for men's team pursuit at the Olympics.




Dawson, Cepuran and Emery Lehman took the bronze in that event in Beijing four years ago, set the world record in 2024 and claimed gold in the team pursuit at the world championships in March.

In the other race Friday, the women's 3,000, Greta Myers won in 4:06.799. As of now, the United States does not have a berth in Milan for that distance, but one of its athletes could end up in the field if another country relinquishes an opening.

“It's hard to wait,” said Myers, a 21-year-old from Lino Lakes, Minnesota. “But I'm very hopeful. I think it's at least a 50-50 chance that it'll happen.”

The U.S. Olympic roster for long track won't become official until the four-day trials at the Pettit National Ice Center wrap up on Monday. One element that could come into play is that the Americans are allowed to bring a maximum of eight men and six women to these Winter Games. 

The biggest star of the team — and the sport — is scheduled to make his trials debut Saturday in the men's 1,000 meters: Jordan Stolz. The 21-year-old from Kewaskum, a town about 40 miles north of Milwaukee, is not just competing at home this week; he's racing at the same rink where he first began taking lessons as a kid.

He made his Olympic debut at age 17 in Beijing four years ago, finishing 13th in the 500 and 14th in the 1,000.

At both the 2023 and 2024 world championships, Stolz earned titles in each of the 500, 1,000 and 1,500 meters.

He's already pre-qualified for the Olympics based on performances at those three distances. All he really needs to do to lock down berths on the squad for the Feb. 6-22 Milan Cortina Games is show up at the starting line this week.

The 500 and 1,500 are slated for Sunday, and the mass start is Monday.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the increase in sports betting and the concerns around betting scandals on ‘Special Report.'  

Former MLB All-Star Lenny Dykstra faces drug charges following a traffic stop by Pennsylvania State Police on New Year's Day.

Pennsylvania troopers found Dykstra, 62, with drugs and paraphernalia in his possession while a passenger in a vehicle that was pulled over in Pike County.

Pike County is about 25 miles east of Scranton, where Dykstra lives.

Police noted that charges were filed against Dykstra, though there was no specification on what drugs were allegedly found.

Dykstra's lawyer, Matthew Blit, said in a statement to The Associated Press that he believes these charges will be ""swiftly absolved"" as the vehicle did not belong to the ex-ballplayer.

Dykstra was also not accused of being under the influence of a substance at the scene, per Blit.

""To the extent charges are brought against him, they will be swiftly absolved,"" the statement read.

Dykstra has had legal woes in the past, including serving prison time in California for bankruptcy fraud. He was sentenced to more than six months after being found guilty of hiding baseball gloves and other items from his days in MLB.

Dykstra also served a three-year sentence for pleading no contest to Grand Theft Auto and providing a false financial statement, claiming he owed more than $31 million while only having $50,000 in assets. His prison sentences ran concurrent with each other.

Then, in April 2012, he pleaded no contest to exposing himself to women he met through Craiglist.

Finally, in 2019, Dykstra dealt with numerous legal problems, including pleading guilty on behalf of his company, Titan Equity Group, to illegally renting out rooms in a New Jersey home he owned. He agreed to pay around $3,000 in fines.

In the same year, Dykstra had drug and terrorist threat charges dropped following an altercation with an Uber driver. Police said at the time they found cocaine, MDMA and marijuana among Dykstra's belongings, though his lawyer claimed the incident to be ""overblown.""

Dykstra was a three-time All-Star during his 12-year MLB career, which began with the New York Mets and ended with the Philadelphia Phillies.

All three of Dykstra's All-Star seasons came in Philadelphia, where he was traded to from New York during the 1989 season.

Dykstra finished second in MVP voting during the 1993 season after leading the National League with 194 hits, 143 runs and 129 walks while slashing .305/.420/.382 with 44 doubles and 66 RBI.

Fox News contributor Hugh Hewitt discusses the legality of U.S. forces' capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and what lies ahead for the Venezuelan people.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro reportedly made a statement on television and radio early Saturday as the U.S. strikes against his country unfolded, describing them as an ""attack against the sovereignty of Venezuela."" 

The remarks came before President Donald Trump announced that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were ""captured and flown out of the country"" following a ""large scale strike"" carried out by the U.S. military. Attorney General Pam Bondi later said Maduro and Flores were indicted on charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy. 

In comments aired on state television and radio, Maduro alleged that U.S. forces attacked civilian and military sites in Venezuela's capital of Caracas, as well as the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, according to The Miami Herald.

""This is an attack against the sovereignty of Venezuela,"" Maduro reportedly said as he stood alongside military and government officials. ""It is an attempt to impose a colonial war and force political change by violence.""

Maduro also described the U.S. actions as a ""grave military aggression"" and violation of the United Nations charter, adding that it threatened peace across Latin America and the Caribbean, The Miami Herald reported. 

The U.S. has been carrying out a military campaign against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific in recent months.

Maduro's government cast the U.S. strikes on Saturday as part of a larger American effort to seize Venezuela's oil and mineral reserves, according to The Miami Herald. 

The newspaper reported that state TV broadcasted images of Venezuelan soldiers deploying to strategic infrastructure and officials holding emergency meetings.

As part of Maduro's response, he also signed a decree that declared a nationwide state of ""external disturbance,"" which gives his government sweeping powers during emergencies, including mobilizing security forces and limiting certain civil liberties, The Miami Herald added.

Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson provides details on President Donald Trump's announcement that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured and flown out of the country during what Trump described as a 'large-scale strike.'

The Venezuelan dictator captured by the Trump administration worked as a bus driver and union organizer before his ascent through the South American country's political system, where he ultimately became a wanted man by the U.S. with a $50 million reward for information leading to his arrest. 

Nicolás Maduro was ""captured and flown out of the country"" early Saturday following a ""large-scale strike"" by the U.S. military, according to President Donald Trump. 

The actions mark a stunning fall for Maduro, who was serving his third term as president of Venezuela. He led an administration that grappled with economic challenges, mass protests, disputed election results and allegations of narco-trafficking. 

Maduro was born in Venezuela's capital of Caracas on Nov. 23, 1962. As a young man, he was sent to communist Cuba in 1986 for a year of ideological instruction — his only studies after high school.

(Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters)

Upon returning home, Maduro found work as a bus driver and union organizer. He embraced the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez after the then-army paratrooper in 1992 staged a failed coup against an unpopular austerity government. Around the same time, he met his longtime partner, Cilia Flores, a lawyer for the jailed leader. 

After Chávez was freed and elected president in 1998, Maduro, a young lawmaker, helped push his agenda of redistributing the OPEC nation's oil wealth and political power. 

In 2000, Maduro was elected to Venezuela's National Assembly. He later became the president of the National Assembly in 2005.

Then in 2006, Chávez appointed Maduro as Venezuela's foreign minister. Six years later, Maduro was appointed as Venezuela's vice president. 

When Maduro took power in 2013 following his mentor's death from cancer, he struggled to bring order to the grief-stricken nation. Without ""El Comandante"" in charge, the economy entered a death spiral — shrinking 71% from 2012 to 2020, with inflation topping 130,000% — and opponents and rivals inside the government saw an opportunity. 

Less than a year into Maduro's presidency, hardliner opponents launched demonstrations demanding his exit.

Leaning heavily on Venezuela's security forces, Maduro crushed the protests. However, with supermarket shelves empty amid widespread shortages, they resumed with more intensity three years later, leaving more than 100 people dead. In 2018, the International Criminal Court initiated a criminal investigation into possible crimes against humanity. 

The crackdown continued into the 2018 presidential race, which the opposition boycotted when several of its leaders were barred from running. Dozens of countries led by the U.S. condemned Maduro's first re-election as illegitimate and recognized Juan Guaidó, the head of the National Assembly, as Venezuela's elected leader. 

""Since 2019, more than 50 countries, including the United States, have refused to recognize Maduro as Venezuela's head of state,"" the State Department said in a profile of Maduro on its website.

""Maduro helped manage and ultimately lead the Cartel of the Suns, a Venezuelan drug-trafficking organization comprised of high-ranking Venezuelan officials. As he gained power in Venezuela, Maduro participated in a corrupt and violent narco-terrorism conspiracy with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization,"" it added.

""Maduro negotiated multi-ton shipments of FARC-produced cocaine; directed the Cartel of the Suns to provide military-grade weapons to the FARC; coordinated with narcotics traffickers in Honduras and other countries to facilitate large-scale drug trafficking; and solicited assistance from FARC leadership in training an unsanctioned militia group that functioned, in essence, as an armed forces unit for the Cartel of the Suns,"" the State Department continued. 

""In March 2020, Maduro was charged in the Southern District of New York for narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices,"" it also said.

Maduro was re-elected again in 2024 in another disputed election. 

""Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo González Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela's July 28 presidential election,"" then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the time.

Maduro then delivered a fiery inauguration speech in January 2025, likening himself to a biblical David fighting Goliath and accusing his opponents and their supporters in the U.S. of trying to turn his inauguration into a ""world war."" 

He said his enemies' failure to block his inauguration to a third six-year term was ""a great victory"" for Venezuela's peace and national sovereignty. 

""I have not been made president by the government of the United States, nor by the pro-imperialist governments of Latin America,"" he said, after being draped with a sash in the red, yellow and blue of Venezuela's flag. ""I come from the people, I am of the people, and my power emanates from history and from the people. And to the people, I owe my whole life, body and soul."" 

Months later, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a $50 million reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest.

""Maduro uses foreign terrorist organizations like TdA (Tren de Aragua), Sinaloa and Cartel of the Suns (Cartel de Soles) to bring deadly violence to our country,"" Bondi said in a video message in August 2025. ""He is one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world and a threat to our national security.""

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, joins 'America's Newsroom' to weigh in on Jack Smith's deposition over secret subpoenas for lawmakers' phone records and looming Capitol Hill battles over Obamacare subsidies and healthcare.

Former special counsel Jack Smith used a closed-door deposition with House Republicans last month to defend his investigations into Donald Trump's alleged effort to subvert the 2020 presidential election and his alleged retention of certain classified documents, using the hours-long testimony to forcefully dispute the notion that his team had acted politically, and citing what he described as ample evidence to support the indictments that had been levied against Trump. 

""I made my decisions in the investigation without regard to President Trump's political association, activities, beliefs or candidacy in the 2024 presidential election,"" Smith told members of the House Judiciary Committee in the Dec. 17 interview.

The interview was Smith's first time appearing before Congress since he left his role as special counsel in 2024. And while much of the information was not new, the exchange was punctuated by sharp exchanges with Republicans on the panel, both on the strength of the case and on his own actions taken during the course of the probe — most recently, on the tolling records his team sought from a handful of Republican lawmakers over the course of the investigation. Republicans have assailed the records as being at odds with the speech or debate clause of the Constitution.  

""I made my decisions in the investigation without regard to President Trump's political association, activities, beliefs, or candidacy in the 2024 presidential election,"" Smith told the committee. ""We took actions based on what the facts, and the law required — the very lesson I learned early in my career as a prosecutor.""

Republicans on the panel ultimately opted to publish the redacted transcript on New Year's Eve, a decision that may have helped dull the impact of any news the 255-page document may have generated amid the broader hustle and bustle of the holiday season.

Here are some of the biggest moments and notable exchanges from the eight-hour hearing. 

 TRUMP STRIPS SECURITY CLEARANCES FROM LAW FIRM TIED TO JACK SMITH CASES

Smith was tapped by former Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 to investigate the alleged effort by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as well as Trump's keeping of allegedly classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach after leaving office in 2020. Smith had brought charges against Trump in both cases.

The charges were dropped after Trump's election, in keeping with a longstanding Justice Department policy that discourages investigating sitting presidents for federal criminal charges, and Smith resigned from his role shortly afterward.

If nothing else, Smith's Dec. 17 testimony underscored just how much has changed since Trump's reelection in 2024. 

Trump, for his part, has used his first year back in office to follow through on his promises to go after his perceived political ""enemies,"" including by revoking security clearances of many individuals, including employees of a D.C.-based law firm that represents Smith, and taking other punitive measures to punish or fire FBI agents involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, investigation.

During his testimony last month, Smith fiercely disputed the notion that Trump's remarks about the 2020 election results would be protected by the First Amendment. 

""Absololutely not,"" he said in response to a lawyer for Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee.

The lawyer then ticked through a ""long list of disputed elections"" in U.S. history and former presidents who have spoken out about ""what they believed to be fraud,"" or other issues regarding election integrity. ""I think you would agree that those types of statements are sort of at the core of the First Amendment rights of a presidential candidate, right?""

""There is no historical analog for what President Trump did in this case,"" Smith said immediately.

Smith told members that the special counsel ultimately gathered evidence against Trump that was, in his view, sufficient to secure a conviction.

""He made false statements to state legislatures, to his supporters in all sorts of contexts and was aware in the days leading up to Jan. 6th that his supporters were angry when he invited them, and then he directed them to the Capitol,"" Smith said of Trump' actions in the run-up to Jan. 6. 

""Now, once they were at the Capitol and once the attack on the Capitol happened, he refused to stop it. He instead issued a tweet that, without question in my mind, endangered the life of his own vice president,"" Smith added. ""And when the violence was going on, he had to be pushed repeatedly by his staff members to do anything to quell it.""

Other possible co-conspirators had not been charged, as Smith noted at one point during the interview. 

But Smith said in the testimony that his team had developed ""proof beyond a reasonable doubt"" that Trump had ""engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election and to prevent the lawful transfer of power.""

They'd also developed what he described as ""powerful evidence"" that Trump had willfully retained highly classified documents after leaving office in January 2021 at his private Mar-a-Lago residence, and had been obstructing the government's efforts to recover the records.

Smith said that, when the special counsel wound down in the wake of the 2024 elections, his team had not determined whether to charge the key Trump allies who may or may not have acted as co-conspirators, including Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and John Eastman.

""As we stated in the final report, we analyzed the evidence against different co-conspirators,"" Smith said. Smith reiterated his allegation that Trump was ""the most culpable"" and ""most responsible"" person for the alleged attempts to subvert the 2020 election results. 

He said the special counsel had ""determined that we did have evidence to charge people at a certain point in time."" 

But at the time the investigation was wound down, they had not made ""final determinations about that at the time that President Trump won reelection, meaning that our office was going to be closed down.""

FBI OUSTS FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, AGENT INVOLVED IN J6 PROSECUTIONS, WITH MORE EXPECTED

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo)

Smith used his opening remarks to lament the ousting of FBI agents and Justice Department officials involved in the Jan. 6 investigations.

""I am both saddened and angered that President Trump has sought revenge against career prosecutors, FBI agents, and support staff simply for doing their jobs and for having worked on those cases,"" Smith said.

His remarks came after the FBI in recent months ousted a handful of personnel involved in the Jan. 6 investigations, an effort individuals familiar with the action described to Fox News at the time as an act of ""retaliation.""

Thousands of FBI personnel in February were forced to fill out a sprawling questionnaire asking employees detailed questions about any role they may have played in the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riots — ranging from whether they had testified in any criminal trials to when they last participated in investigation-related activity.

FBI AGENTS SUE TRUMP DOJ TO BLOCK ANY PUBLIC IDENTIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED ON JAN. 6 INVESTIGATIONS

Smith was grilled during the deposition about the highly scrutinized subpoenas his team issued to phone companies for data belonging to House and Senate lawmakers as part of his investigation, saying they aligned with the Justice Department's policy at the time.

Smith said the Public Integrity Section had signed off on the subpoenas, a point corroborated by records previously released by Grassley's office. 

Those records also showed that the Public Integrity Section told prosecutors to be wary of concerns lawmakers could raise about the Constitution's speech or debate clause, which gives Congress members added protections.

The subpoenas to the phone companies were accompanied by gag orders blocking the lawmakers from learning about the existence of the subpoenas for at least one year. Smith said the D.C. federal court, which authorized the gag orders, would not have been aware that they applied to Congress members."" I don't think we identified that, because I don't think that was Department policy at the time,"" Smith said.

Asked during the deposition about who should be held accountable for lawmakers who felt that the seizure of a narrow set of their phone data was a constitutional violation, Smith said Trump should be held accountable.

""These records are people, in the case of the Senators, Donald Trump directed his co-conspirators to call these people to further delay the proceedings,"" Smith said.

""He chose to do that. If Donald Trump had chosen to call a number of Democratic senators, we would have gotten toll records for Democratic Senators. So responsibility for why these records, why we collected them, that's — that lies with Donald Trump,"" he said.

The U.S. military carried out a ""large-scale strike"" in Venezuela early Saturday morning and took Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife into custody, President Donald Trump confirmed.

The president wrote on Truth Social that the operation was successful and Maduro and his wife were ""captured and flown out of the country."" Trump said the operation was conducted with U.S. law enforcement and added that a news conference will take place at Mar-a-Lago at 11 a.m. on Saturday.

At least seven explosions could be heard in Venezuela's capital city of Caracas early Saturday morning, according to The Associated Press, and low-flying aircraft were seen flying over Caracas at about 2 a.m. local time.

The helicopters seen flying over Caracas were part of the U.S. Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the ""Night Stalkers.""

The Venezuelan government said in a statement that ""the civilian and military localities of the city of Caracas, capital of the Republic, and the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira"" were impacted by the attack.

The statement also accused the U.S. of committing a ""very serious military aggression"" against Venezuela and carrying out ""imperialist aggression.""

""The objective of this attack is none other than to seize Venezuela's strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals, attempting to break the Nation's political independence by force,"" the Government of Venezuela said in a statement. ""They will not succeed. After more than two hundred years of independence, the people and their legitimate Government remain steadfast in defense of sovereignty and the inalienable right to decide their own destiny.""

The statement also said the ""attempt to impose a colonial war to destroy the republican form of government and force a ‘regime change,' in alliance with the fascist oligarchy, will fail just like all previous attempts.""

Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau reacted to Trump's announcement, describing it as a ""new dawn for Venezuela.""

""The tyrant is gone,"" Landau posted on X. ""He will now — finally —face justice for his crimes.""

MADURO SAYS VENEZUELA IS 'READY' TO MAKE DEAL WITH US ON DRUGS AND OIL AFTER MILITARY STRIKES

The attack comes amid the U.S. military's targeting of alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, questioned the justification for the strike in a post on X early Saturday, writing, ""I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.""

Maduro said Thursday that his government was open to negotiating an agreement with the United States after months of American military pressure targeting drug trafficking networks tied to his government.

In a pre-taped interview with Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet that aired on state television, Maduro said Venezuela is ""ready"" to discuss a drug-trafficking deal with the U.S. He called on the countries to ""start talking seriously, with data in hand.""

""The U.S. government knows, because we've told many of their spokespeople, that if they want to seriously discuss an agreement to combat drug trafficking, we're ready,"" he said. ""If they want oil, Venezuela is ready for U.S. investment, like with Chevron, whenever they want it, wherever they want it and however they want it.""

The U.S. Embassy in Bogotá, Colombia, warned U.S. citizens on Saturday not to travel to Venezuela and advised those in the country to shelter in place.

A Travel Advisory from Dec. 3 states that all U.S. citizens in Venezuela are strongly advised to depart immediately. The Department of State withdrew all diplomatic personnel from U.S. Embassy Caracas and suspended operations in March 2019.

President Donald Trump is addressing the United States's overnight strikes on Venezuela during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

The press briefing is set to begin at 11 a.m. on Saturday morning. 

MADURO ‘CAPTURED' AND TAKEN OUT OF VENEZUELA AFTER US MILITARY OPERATION IN CARACAS: TRUMP

The U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife during the special operation, according to Trump, who said in his first television interview following the strikes that the U.S. would be “making the decision” about who should lead the country next.

“We'll be involved in it very much. And we want to do liberty for the people. We want to, you know, have a great relationship. I think the people of Venezuela are very, very happy because they love the United States. You know, they were run by, essentially, a dictatorship,” Trump said during an appearance on Fox and Friends.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The U.S. military “captured” Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro after a special forces military operation in Caracas, President Donald Trump announced.

“The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow,” he said in a post on Truth Social.

The operation is unprecedented in modern history, and marks the first time a head of state has been taken captive by a rival nation in an opening special forces operation.

Officials told CBS that Delta Force, the Army's most elite unit, was the one that carried out the operation.

The Venezuelan government hasn't yet acknowledged the alleged abduction of its head of state. It's unclear who is in charge of the country in Maduro's absence.

According to Venezuela's constitution, power should pass to Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez. Rodríguez will face even worse legitimacy issues than Maduro, however, and pressure from the democratic opposition is sure to increase. Venezuela's opposition holds that the exiled Edmundo Gonzalez is the rightful president of the country.

In a national address, Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez, denounced the U.S. operation as an “invasion” that “represents the most blatant outrage suffered by the country.”

Lopez's address marked the first public appearance of a Venezuelan official since the operation. He didn't address the apparent abduction of Maduro.

Trump provided further details of the operation in a brief phone interview with the New York Times.

“A lot of good planning and lot of great, great troops and great people,” Trump said. “It was a brilliant operation, actually.”

He said he would address concerns, such as whether he had sought congressional approval and what's next for Venezuela, at his 11 a.m. news conference at Mar-a-Lago.

Trump began ratcheting up pressure against Maduro shortly after taking office, putting a $50 million bounty on his head. Maduro was charged with widespread corruption, running a narcoterrorist group, and drug trafficking. Trump and his officials had gone so far as to repeatedly publicly threaten his life.

Maduro's fate in the U.S. is another matter. He may face charges in a U.S. court of law, given the allegations against him. His arrest is guaranteed to draw widespread outrage not just from Maduro's allies, including Russia, Iran, and China, but from other countries concerned with diplomatic norms as well.

In December, there were reports about a deal that would have Maduro step down, in exchange for him being allowed to live freely in Russia.

Videos of explosions hitting major military and government targets were posted across social media beginning at around 2 a.m. local time on Saturday. Simultaneously, videos showed helicopters of various types hovering over the city. Among these were reported sightings of CH-47 Chinook transport helicopters hovering over the city, apparently, the helicopters containing the special forces that took Maduro captive.

VENEZUELA DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY AFTER US OPERATION IN CARACAS

The operation lasted around one hour, with explosions reported from around 2 a.m. local time to 3 a.m. local time. No further strikes have been reported.

The U.S. attempted a similar operation in 1989 to capture Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega as part of Operation Just Cause. U.S. special operations soldiers, including Delta Force, raided several hideouts hoping to capture the drug trafficker, but came up empty-handed. Noriega later had to be coaxed out of the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See with heavy metal music, weeks after the invasion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Mamdani's collectivist vision for America","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/4399614/mamdani-collectivist-vision-for-america/","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT","

The most disturbing part of New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani's inauguration was not that he chose fellow socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to swear him in, nor that he was sworn in on the Quran, nor even his call to “replace the frigidity of rugged individualism with the warmth of collectivism,” although all of these a reason for dislike and repudiation.

His most disturbing words were those in which he described his support of collectivism, which come from South Africa's Freedom Charter.

“Beginning today, we will govern expansively and audaciously,” he declared. He reminded everyone that he “was elected as a democratic socialist” and promised to “govern as a democratic socialist.” And “to those who insist that the era of big government is over,” Mamdani said that under his leadership, “no longer will City Hall hesitate to use its power.”

Mamdani then asked, “Who does New York belong to?” before asserting that under past administrations, City Hall belonged “to the wealthy and well-connected.” Under Mamdani, New York would belong to “all who live in it,” a sentiment he said was inspired by the charter.

Considering that Mamdani is himself an immigrant from Africa and that his father was a Marxist professor, it is hardly surprising that he looks to foreign documents written by communists, rather than to our own founding documents, when identifying his model for governance.

The South African Freedom Charter is antithetical to the U.S. Constitution. It calls for the nationalization of mines, banks, and industry, land confiscation and redistribution, and direct majoritarian rule with no meaningful checks on government power.

We have seen how this model has played out. South Africa is increasingly a failed state. Unemployment hovers near 30%, youth joblessness is far higher, and rolling power outages from the collapsing electricity monopoly routinely shut down the economy. Its violent crime rates are among the world's worst, its infrastructure is decaying, corruption has hollowed out state institutions, and growth has stagnated for over a decade. Public services barely function, and emigration drains skills and capital.

This is Mamdani's vision for first New York and then the United States.

To be clear, the damage Mamdani can inflict as mayor is not unlimited. New York City is not a sovereign polity, and the mayor is not a president. Mamdani cannot simply confiscate property, nor can he create or raise income or sales taxes without approval from Albany.

But limited power is not the same thing as no power or harmlessness. Even within his constraints, a mayor committed to collectivist ideology can do serious damage to a city's quality of life, public safety, and economic vitality.

Mamdani will exert direct control over how aggressively city laws are enforced. He can tolerate the expansion of homeless encampments under the banner of compassion, degrading public spaces, and driving families and businesses away.

He can also weaken public safety. A mayor who views policing primarily as oppression rather than a public good will cut funding, restrict proactive policing, and signal hostility toward officers doing their jobs.

And while Mamdani cannot invent new taxes, he can still raise existing ones. Property taxes are set through the city budget process, and a mayor determined to run an expansive government can push the city council to approve higher levies. Those costs will not fall on an abstract class of “the rich,” but on renters, landlords, and businesses already struggling with high costs.

New York is not South Africa, and it is not yet doomed to South Africa's fate. But the lesson of the Freedom Charter is that when governments elevate collective claims over individual rights, disorder becomes normalized, corruption flourishes, and the middle class leaves.

Mamdani insists that his collectivism will be different, warmer, more humane. Every collectivist says that. The record suggests otherwise. What begins with moral certainty ends with coercion, mismanagement, and decline.

FIVE HOPES FOR THE NEW YEAR

At the end of his address, Mamdani acknowledged the stakes himself. “There are many who will be watching,” he said. “They want to know if the Left can govern.”

Yes, voters will be watching — and one can only hope they see Mamdani's vision for what it is and choose something else.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Republicans rally around Trump after Maduro capture as Democrats cry foul over its legality","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/4400179/republicans-rally-around-trump-maduro-capture-democrats-cry-foul/","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:19:18 GMT","

Republican lawmakers are praising President Donald Trump for his capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, while Democrats are raising questions about the legality of the U.S. special forces operation on foreign soil.

Republicans, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), underscored the importance of the moment for the Venezuelan people, describing Maduro as “an evil, narcoterrorist dictator.”

“It is in America's interest to bring justice to Maduro, an illegitimate narcoterrorist dictator with American blood on his hands,” Graham wrote Saturday on social media. “To President Trump and his team, you should take great pride in setting in motion the liberation of Venezuela.”

TRUMP FIRST YEAR REPORT CARD: A- PROMISE KEEPER OR ‘NIGHTMARE' FAILURE

As we celebrate this amazing achievement by our military commanded by @POTUS, we must remember the consequences of what has happened. An evil, narcoterrorist dictator has fallen, creating a path for freedom for the wonderful, highly intelligent, hard working people of Venezuela.…

Graham's message was amplified by the likes of Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), who emphasized how he had spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and reminded the public that Maduro was indicted in the U.S. almost six years ago for drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. 

“I just spoke to @SecRubio, who confirmed that Maduro is in U.S. custody and will face justice for his crimes against our citizens,” Cotton wrote.

Nicolas Maduro wasn't just an illegitimate dictator; he also ran a vast drug-trafficking operation. That's why he was indicted in U.S. court nearly six years ago for drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. I just spoke to @SecRubio, who confirmed that Maduro is in U.S. custody and…

Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) similarly shared his own conversation with Rubio, adding the secretary told him “the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant.”

TRUMP WARNS OF JANUARY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN OVER OBAMACARE

“This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,” Lee wrote.

Just got off the phone with @SecRubioHe informed me that Nicolás Maduro has been arrested by U.S. personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant… https://t.co/lXCxhPoKSZ

Regardless, Democratic reaction has focused on the legality of the operation, conducted overnight in Caracas by Delta Force, the Army's most elite unit, and confirmed by Trump on social media. 

Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, who was also taken in the raid, were indicted in the Southern District of New York in 2020, with Maduro charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machineguns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices against the U.S. 

TRUMP ADVISES THAT ANYONE BURNING AMERICAN FLAG WILL BE IMPRISONED FOR A YEAR

Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-MA) reiterated that Trump had “no authority to strike Venezuela, no strategy for a democratic transition, and no credibility that he won't just pardon the criminal Maduro like he did the Honduran president.” 

“After voting No in December, Republicans in Congress must now join Democrats to grab hold the steering wheel of Venezuela policy to prevent this capture from spiraling into a blood for oil war,” Auchincloss wrote.

I commanded Marines in Latin America – they deserve a commander in chief operating lawfully and strategically. The president has no authority to strike Venezuela, no strategy for a democratic transition, and no credibility that he won't just pardon the criminal Maduro like he did…

Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ) added that Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth told senators that Trump was not pursuing regime change in Venezuela. 

“I didn't trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” Kim wrote. “Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.”

Breaking:The U.S. has attacked Venezuela and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro. Read our full coverage.

The capture of Nicolás Maduro is a show of ambition that calls for an effective response.

When Donald Trump claims a success, two things quickly happen:

From the pro-Trump side, the American people hear a huge and unanimous whoop of triumph.

Because the Trump movement is a cult of personality, with no consistent principles and no concern for truth, many of its boosters don't care whether the success is real or phony. They don't care whether the advertised “success” actually happened the way Trump says it did. They don't care whether the so-called success achieves anything important or lasting. They don't care if there later turns out to be a corrupt underside. They celebrate peace plans that don't bring peace, trade deals that don't enhance trade. The Trump movement exists to glorify Trump, in all his erratic mania. Results in the real world don't matter.

From the anti-Trump side, meanwhile, the American people hear a nervous rustling of vague doubts.

Because the anti-Trump side tends to care about facts, it hesitates to speak before it knows what it's talking about. There's a decent likelihood that the president's story is a lie. But what kind of lie, covering up what truth? Because the truth takes time to come to light, the anti-Trump side will be slow to respond to the pro-Trump boast and brag.

Because most on the anti-Trump side care about institutions, they measure their words so they won't be misinterpreted as criticism of those parts of the U.S. government that preexisted Trump and—they hope—will survive him. Trump uses the military so often because he correctly assesses that respect for the courage and professionalism of its personnel will transfer to him.

Because the anti-Trump side cares about fairness, many of its most prominent figures hesitate to accuse Trump of corrupt motives until sufficient evidence emerges to support the accusation. That Trump has ordered the military to seize an alleged drug-trafficking Latin American head of state barely a month after he pardoned and released a convicted drug-trafficking Latin American head of state is suspicious, to say the least. But until and unless there's something to back those suspicions, and perhaps recalling the readiness of Trump's regulatory agencies to retaliate against Trump-critical speech, many on the anti-Trump side deem it unwise to voice them. The possibility that U.S. armed forces could have been deployed because Trump insiders bought into a shady scheme to grab Venezuelan oil seems far-fetched—yet it may be much more grounded in reality than any learned article concocting a Trump grand strategy.

Because the anti-Trump side defends the rule of law, it can be drawn into legalistic objections that sound pettifogging and irrelevant. Americans want the flow of drugs reduced. They don't much care how it's done. Many on the anti-Trump side are so rightly outraged by the anti-constitutionality and illegality of Trump's antidrug actions that they leave to later how useless those actions often are. Over Trump's first year in power, the price of cocaine in the United States has dropped steeply, the one price Trump has reduced. That trend suggests that Trump's multibillion-dollar operation against boats that may or may not be carrying drugs is wasteful and even counterproductive—but unless carefully stated, the arguments of the anti-Trump side can appear to emphasize legal forms over the lives Trump falsely claims to be saving.

Because the anti-Trump side includes progressives and others uncomfortable with American power, it often gets distracted by Trump's militaristic show—and fails to reckon with the president's inner weakness. When Trump officials briefed Congress and the press about Venezuela, they disavowed a goal of “regime change.” Now the U.S. has seized Nicolás Maduro, and some progressives have charged Trump officials with lying to them. But the real problem is that those officials may have been telling the truth. Just as Maduro's dictatorial regime allowed Venezuela's apparatus of repression to outlive its founder, Hugo Chávez, the removal of one regime figure now may merely transfer power to another. The United States government recognized Edmundo González as the rightful winner of Venezuela's 2024 presidential election. It will take more than an abduction to bring González to power, however. The progressive impulse to blame Trump for doing too much in Venezuela can obscure the reality that—for all the noise—Trump may not have done enough.

Because the anti-Trump side is preoccupied with domestic politics, it sometimes overlooks how Trump is corroding American leadership in the world. The Venezuelan regime is broadly unpopular in Latin America; its socialism of plunder has sent millions of desperate people into Colombia and other states. But U.S. intervention is deeply mistrusted in the region, associated much more closely with bringing dictators to power than with toppling them. The administration could have courted greater legitimacy for its actions by cooperating with regional partners, such as Colombia and Brazil, which have both tangled with the Maduro regime in the recent past. Refusing such cooperation is not merely an incidental vice of Trump's foreign policy. That vice is at its core. Military action in Venezuela today without allies may prefigure action tomorrow against allies—for example, to invade and annex Greenland. The big strategic idea of the second Trump administration is that major powers are entitled to dominate their neighbors: Russia to dominate Ukraine, China to dominate its neighborhood, and the U.S. to rule over Venezuela, Greenland, Panama, and ultimately Canada—Trump's desired “51st state.”

We'll all know more soon about the Venezuelan operation. But we know plenty already about the anti-Trump opposition. The qualities itemized above are not all faults. It's good to care about law, institutions, and facts. But even good qualities can produce bad outcomes if they are not self-understood, self-restrained, and directed in the service of good goals.

Trump thrives on the ineffectiveness of his opponents. The military operation in Venezuela is a warning that Trump's imperial ambitions are growing. He's building himself a triumphal arch in Washington. He craves gaudy acts to justify his monument to himself. He announced his operation first on his own wacky social-media platform, then on a phone call to Fox—as if his fan base were the only part of the nation to whom the president owed an explanation for his actions. Trump's ego poses clear and present dangers to American democracy and American world leadership. An ineffective anti-Trump movement is an indulgence American democracy cannot afford or accept.

Breaking:The U.S. has attacked Venezuela and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro. Read our full coverage.

All actions have consequences—even arbitrary and inscrutable ones.

Updated at 12:00 p.m. ET on January 3, 2026

The Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro's regime lasted 12 years before America ended it today. This seems to be what the monthslong American military pressure campaign on Venezuela was building toward—the strikes on boats carrying drugs in international waters, the seizure of oil tankers, and the CIA-engineered port explosion. Early this morning, military installations in Caracas started exploding. Hours later, President Donald Trump announced that he had ordered a “large scale strike against Venezuela”—and that America had captured Maduro and flown him out of the country.

The apparent goal is to have Maduro stand trial in America, facing, in the words of Attorney General Pam Bondi, “the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.” In 2020, Maduro was indicted on charges of cocaine and weapons trafficking by federal prosecutors. Having gone here, the Trump administration apparently wishes to go no further: Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, told Republican Senator Mike Lee that he “anticipates no further action in Venezuela.”

This is Trump's most audacious foreign-policy decision in either term of office—more significant than the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander, in 2020 or even the strike on Iranian nuclear facilities last year. But, alongside the rest of Trump's decisions, it is an incoherent one: The “America First” faction of the Republican Party denigrates regime change as a compulsion of neoconservatives—then pulls off a defenestration as spectacular as America's arrest of Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian dictator, in 1990. Maduro is an authoritarian and a blight to the Venezuelan people, certainly, but this administration is hardly one that finds all autocrats anathema. Trump wants to bring Maduro to justice for allegedly running a narcotrafficking empire while president of Venezuela not even two months after pardoning Juan Orlando Hernández—who ran a narcotrafficking empire while president of Honduras and had been sentenced to 45 years in prison by an American jury. Trump wants to muscularly intervene in Central and South American affairs—what some observers are calling the “Donroe Doctrine”—but also does not want to deal with the increased migration that often comes from rupturing regimes.

How do we make sense of this new American arbitrariness—willing to drop massive bombs on buried Iranian nuclear facilities and kidnap dictators, but unwilling to keep providing funds to the defense of Ukraine, even if this risks no actual American soldiers? One interpretation of “America First” foreign policy is as a halfway station between proper isolationism and neoconservatism: The Trump administration intervenes where it can do so easily and without immediate consequence, but shies away from long-term commitments and occupations. This interpretation was undercut by Trump's statement at his 11 a.m. address, however, that the U.S. is “going to run the country.”

A second interpretation of the Venezuelan operation is that Trump is inaugurating a return to spheres of influence. Trump rejects the rules-based international order set up after World War II (which placed America as its keystone), and he despises the globalists in the Washington foreign-policy blob and European capitals who still believe in it. In this view, great powers ought to be able to intervene in their own backyards. This is why America can do as it sees fit in Venezuela. It is also why Trump often seems more sympathetic to Russian President Vladimir Putin than to Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky. The return of spheres-of-influence thinking bodes poorly for the chances of America intervening if China were to invade Taiwan while Trump is still in office. The conflict would be seen as an intramural dispute—one that poses risks to American ships, soldiers, and submarines that are orders of magnitude greater than the risks posed by Trump's targets so far.

The Venezuelan incursion also reflects the central failing of American domestic politics: the continued declining relevance of Congress. Even though the prescribed constitutional order is to have Congress declare wars, President Trump has brazenly ignored this power. In this instance, it is hard to even begin to construct the legal basis for the military action. Vice President J. D. Vance suggested on X that this morning's incursion is legal because “Maduro has multiple indictments in the United States for narcoterrorism.” But as my colleague Conor Friedersdorf has noted, this logic would mean that the president can order an invasion of “any country where a national has an outstanding arrest warrant.”

Of course, circumventing the legislature is not a Trumpian innovation. Harry Truman described the Korean War as an American “international police action” to avoid needing a formal congressional declaration of war. George H. W. Bush's invasion of Panama in 1989, which culminated in the arrest of Noriega, was also not authorized by Congress. What is new about the Trump era is taking the blithe disregard for the other branches of government that American presidents have enjoyed in foreign affairs and seeking to apply it to spheres of governance, too—whether that is the declaration of tariffs, the deployment of the National Guard, or even the enforcement of ordinary laws. The administration has essentially ignored the law requiring the sale of TikTok. It is hard to imagine the current Congress, having allowed the president to encroach on all of these powers already, demanding actual justification for the administration's actions in Venezuela.

But as free as Congress leaves him, Trump may find that the rest of the world does not comply with his wish to intervene militarily and “run” a foreign country, whatever that may mean. Perhaps a democratic revolution in Venezuela will place an opposition leader like María Corina Machado in charge; or perhaps another authoritarian figure will try to inherit Maduro's regime—just as  Maduro was able to reconstitute the regime of Hugo Chávez. Colombia has already had millions of Venezuelans flee across its borders and is worried about further destabilization. The principles of Trump's foreign policy remain even harder to discern after the Venezuelan intervention than they did before it. But all actions have consequences—even arbitrary and inscrutable ones.

Breaking:The U.S. has attacked Venezuela and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro. Read our full coverage.

By going around Congress, the president is showing contempt for the will of the public.

Updated at 8:44 a.m. ET on January 3, 2026

This morning, President Trump unilaterally launched a regime-change war against Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, ordering strikes on multiple military targets in the country and seizing its leader and his wife. They were “captured and flown out of the country,” Trump stated on Truth Social. “They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,” Attorney General Pam Bondi stated, in something like an inversion of the notion that justice should be blind and impartial.

After Pearl Harbor, Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed Congress and asked it to declare war on Japan. Prior to waging regime-change wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, George W. Bush sought and secured authorizations to use military force. Those presidents asked for permission to conduct hostilities because the supreme law of the land, the Constitution, unambiguously vests the war power in Congress. And Congress voted to authorize force in part because a majority of Americans favored war.

Trump says he will speak to the nation at 11 a.m. eastern time and address his rationale for the attack. The president may point to the fact that the State Department has branded Maduro the head of a “narcoterrorist” state, and that in 2020 Maduro was indicted in the United States on charges that he oversaw a violent drug cartel. For months Trump has been seeking the ouster of Maduro, and aligning the United States with opposition figures who contest the legitimacy of his presidency.

But these accusations and the indictment wouldn't seem to constitute legal justification. Overnight, multiple members of Congress pointed out that Trump's new war is illegal because he received no permission to wage it, and it was not an emergency response to an attack on our homeland or the imminent threat of one.

The probable illegality of Trump's actions does not foreclose the possibility that his approach will improve life for Venezuelans. Like too many world leaders, Maduro is a brutal thug, and opposition figures have good reason to insist he isn't the country's legitimate leader. I hope and pray his ouster yields peace and prosperity, not blood-soaked anarchy or years of grinding factional violence.

But “toppling Maduro is the easy part,” Orlando J. Pérez, the author of Civil-Military Relations in Post-Conflict Societies, warned in November. “What follows is the hard strategic slog of policing a sprawling, heavily armed society where state services have collapsed and regime loyalists, criminal syndicates, and colectivos—pro-government armed groups that police neighborhoods and terrorize dissidents—all compete for turf.” Two groups of Colombian militants “operate openly from Venezuelan safe havens, running mining and smuggling routes,” he added. “They would not go quietly.”

If those challenges are overcome, Trump may lack the leadership qualities necessary for long-term success. Now that the United States has involved itself this way, its leaders are implicated in securing a stable postwar Venezuela and in staving off chaos that could destabilize the region. Yet Trump is best suited to military operations that are quick and discrete, like the strikes on the Iranian general Qassem Soleimani or Iran's nuclear sites, as they do not require sustained focus or resolve. He is most ill-suited, I think, to a regime-change war against a country with lucrative natural resources. I fear Trump will try to enrich himself, his family, or his allies, consistent with his lifelong pattern of self-interested behavior; I doubt he will be a fair-minded, trusted steward of Venezuelan oil. If he indulges in self-dealing, he could fuel anti-American resentment among Venezuelans and intensify opposition to any regime friendly to the United States and its interests.

Another problem confronting Trump as he goes to war is that his political coalition, and indeed his Cabinet, is divided between interventionists and noninterventionists. “The United States needs to stay out of Venezuela,” Tulsi Gabbard, his director of national intelligence, declared in 2019. “Let the Venezuelan people determine their future. We don't want other countries to choose our leaders—so we have to stop trying to choose theirs.”

Whether the outcome is ultimately good for Venezuelans, as I hope, or bad, Trump has betrayed Americans. He could have tried to persuade Congress or the public to give him permission to use force. He didn't bother. He chose war despite polls that found a large majority of Americans opposed it. Perhaps, like me, they fear America is about to repeat the mistakes of its interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, where brutal regimes were ousted, then ruinous power vacuums followed.

“I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force,” Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, posted. After a phone call with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he posted again: Rubio had informed him that Maduro “has been arrested by U.S. personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant,” he said. “This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack.” But surely the president can't invade any country where a national has an outstanding arrest warrant.

The real question isn't whether this action was legal; it is what to do about its illegality. Ignoring the law and the people's will in this fashion is a high crime. Any Congress inclined to impeach and remove Trump from office over Venezuela would be within their rights. That outcome is unlikely unless Democrats win the midterms. But Congress should enforce its war power. Otherwise, presidents of both parties will keep launching wars of choice with no regard for the will of people or our representatives. And anti-war voters will be radicalized by the dearth of democratic means to effect change.

War-weary voters who thought it was enough to elect a president who called the Iraq War “a stupid thing” and promised an “America First” foreign policy can now see for themselves that they were wrong. In 2026, as ever, only Congress can stop endless wars of choice. And if Trump faces no consequences for this one, he may well start another.

Breaking:The U.S. has attacked Venezuela and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro. Read our full coverage.

The competition between China and the United States is about more than technology.

Government officials in Hangzhou have grand ambitions to make their city in eastern China a global center for artificial intelligence—and the funds to try to make it happen. In June, they pledged $140 million to subsidize AI firms that operate in town. Not to be outdone, Shanghai promptly followed in July with its own $140 million subsidy program, and inaugurated an “AI innovation town” two months later with low-cost office space for start-ups in the sector. In the south, Shenzhen was already doling out $70 million a year to support local AI firms and research, while Chengdu, in the west, invested $42 million in a start-up called Zhipu AI to bring a new model-training center and research facility to the city.

This frenzied spending spree follows a playbook that has proved successful in many industries in China: The state acts as cheerleader, financier, and protector, uniting the country's bureaucrats, executives, and entrepreneurs in a mission that Beijing believes is vital to China's future.

China's top-down approach has made the country the envy of much of the world when it comes to industries such as manufacturing and infrastructure construction. But AI—and the technological innovation it demands—is something different. “The Chinese government is struggling to figure out how to support” the AI sector, Paul Triolo, a partner at the advisory firm Albright Stonebridge Group who specializes in Chinese technology, told me. The U.S. government, in contrast, “is trying to get out of the way and create an environment in which capital markets and these very innovative companies can run with the ball.”

Matteo Wong: The AI industry is radicalizing

That makes the contest for AI not just between engineers and algorithms but between China's centralized autocracy and America's decentralized democracy. It pits American private enterprise and its immense financial resources, talent, and creative energies against a Chinese government determined to dominate this new technology at any cost. The future of AI is too uncertain to know just yet which approach will win out. But as things stand, even the most disciplined and dedicated policy makers in China may struggle to compete with the wealth, expertise, and experience of America's private tech sector.

Given the ways in which AI promises to reshape nearly every aspect of our lives, the stakes for this race are high. Whichever country claims the lead could gain an edge not just technologically and economically, but also diplomatically, militarily, and in any area that relies on ingenuity.

In China, however, this race feels existential. After decades of robust growth, the country's investment-led economic engine is running on empty. The Communist Party plainly hopes that AI technology will offer a solution to the country's economic malaise—a way to restore growth without resorting to the kinds of reforms that might loosen the party's grip on power. With its society aging and public discontent mounting, Chinese leaders are keen to put AI to work. If their strategy fails, the divisions between the party and public may deepen, leading to even greater repression and a more uncertain future.

All AI companies are racing to develop smarter large language models and the expensive infrastructure to support them. But in the U.S., the strategy is primarily to build bigger and more powerful models as rapidly as possible, to hasten both the adoption and the profitability of AI. The ultimate ambition is to achieve “artificial general intelligence,” whereby a machine can match the cognition and problem-solving of a human brain.

In China, the prevailing assumption is that AI models are already good enough to deliver benefits now. In August, the State Council, China's top governing body, pledged to promote “the broad and deep integration of AI across all industries and areas of the economy and society” by 2035. China's leadership wants every civil servant, lab scientist, factory manager, corporate executive, and army general to be harnessing AI asap.

In the U.S., the hope is that artificial general intelligence “will provide a cross-sectoral advantage across the economy, across the military,” Scott Singer, a fellow who focuses on technology at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told me. “For China, it's much more about how a conventional, meaningful boost to your economic, and perhaps military, productivity creates competitiveness.”

China's leaders have had their eyes fixed on AI for nearly a decade. In 2017, the State Council introduced a national plan for AI development with the intention of “making China the world's primary AI innovation center.” The Chinese government has spent at least $200 billion over the past decade on supporting the AI sector. Adding related state funding for chips and other industries probably puts this sum at more than $300 billion, according to estimates from the Council on Foreign Relations using data from a study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. China now presents the only real threat to American leadership in AI.

This kind of state muscle is great for making steel and cars, but it doesn't necessarily work when it comes to conceiving and adopting something as complicated as AI. “It's much harder for the government to almost mandate or just push through adoption at a large scale” in AI versus other industries, Jeffrey Ding, a specialist on China's AI sector at George Washington University, told me. When it comes to infrastructure, “you can build the bridges; you can invest in high-speed rail.” But to get people to use AI systems, “it has to make sense for them from a profit perspective, from a market perspective.”

More perniciously, China's leaders have also refused to liberalize the country's antiquated financial system. Bureaucrats have stunted the development of stock markets, and their distrust of private enterprise has scared off investors and venture capitalists. This means that Chinese AI companies cannot raise the kinds of funds that their American competitors do with ease. According to an analysis by Ding based on data from a Chinese research institute, four top U.S. tech giants—Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon—have together invested over eight times more in data centers and other infrastructure necessary to support AI than China's seven leading internet companies combined. And state funding doesn't appear to be making up the difference.

China's AI sector is further hobbled by Washington's curbs on selling advanced American AI chips to Chinese companies, because China's semiconductor industry is not yet capable of producing equivalent alternatives. Over the objections of many national-security experts, President Donald Trump has allowed the U.S. semiconductor giant Nvidia to sell more AI chips to China, but he has maintained the ban on the most powerful American chips, at least for now. Chinese efforts to boost its own chip industry have fallen short.

These constraints place China's AI firms at a disadvantage. Experts generally agree that American AI models perform better than their Chinese competitors. Without sufficient investment or chips, the Chinese industry may never catch up. If an American firm does create an AI model that rivals human intelligence “using breakthrough technologies that others don't know, then they may really squash the rest of the world,” Kai-Fu Lee, the chairman of the venture-capital firm Sinovation Ventures and an AI expert in China, told me.

But the race is far from over. Despite these considerable obstacles, Chinese AI firms have proved adept at keeping pace with their richer U.S. peers. DeepSeek startled Silicon Valley last year with a model that rivals ChatGPT but built with far less money and computing muscle. The Chinese AI industry has also chosen to be “open source,” which means that the source code of models from DeepSeek and Alibaba is freely available to study, improve, and share, and is cheaper to use than U.S. alternatives, which are largely kept private.

“The American approach is like, I'm a genius; I'm going to win the Nobel prize; I'll invent something and beat everyone to it,” Lee said. “The Chinese approach is We're all good students; we're not geniuses; we're going to do our homework together.”

Michael Schuman: DeepSeek and the truth about Chinese tech

Chinese entrepreneurs and engineers are channeling their efforts into more practical applications of AI that promise a wider reach. About 70 percent of users of a Chinese AI-video generator called Kling, for example, are outside China. Chinese companies are also moving quickly to capitalize on the country's vast manufacturing capacity by deploying AI in everyday objects, such as cars, eyeglasses, toys, and transcription devices. Tom van Dillen, the managing partner of the Beijing-based technology consulting firm Greenkern, told me that 17 of the top 20 car brands in China have integrated DeepSeek's AI into their models. “The ability to take a lot of these new technologies and put them into use in creative ways is superior” in China than in the United States, he said.

Given the questions that plague the future of AI, what may seem like clear-cut comparative advantages may prove not to be. Perhaps China's aggressive state spending, open-source AI coding, and interest in ordinary use cases for the technology will ultimately give the country an edge over American firms that are expensively chasing revolutionary applications for a more theoretical product. Perhaps the sheer diversity of AI and its potential applications makes it wrong to conceive of this competition between the U.S. and China as a winner-takes-all binary.

Or perhaps this race will indeed reinforce which political and economic model best enables technological innovation: China's aggressive meddling or America's intensive enabling. The U.S. would seem to have the upper hand here, but it would be unwise to count China—and the Communist Party—out.

Breaking:The U.S. has attacked Venezuela and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro. Read our full coverage.

A decade into the Trump era, readers who were once hungry to learn about the man seem to have had their fill.

Not too long ago, books about Donald Trump were the safest bet in publishing. Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff's tell-all about Trump's chaotic first year in office, was a monster best seller in 2018, as were his subsequent Trump books in 2019 and 2021. Each volume of Bob Woodward's three-part chronicle of Trump's first term (Fear, Rage, and Peril) all reached the top of the New York Times nonfiction list. Insider accounts (such as Unhinged, by Omarosa Manigault Newman, briefly a Trump-administration official), polemics (Triggered, by Donald Trump Jr.), and other journalistic narratives captivated readers, too. All told, during his first term, at least 20 Trump-related books hit the top spot on the Times list.

Now the best-seller lists tell a different story: The Trump-book bubble has burst. This is no doubt partly the result of reader fatigue—there are only so many Trump books any one politics junkie can be expected to buy. But the president himself might be personally undermining the value proposition of books about his favorite subject. During his first term, Trump books promised juicy revelations about behind-the-scenes conflict, offensive comments made in private, and crazy plans narrowly averted. This time around, Trump's team seems united, his offensive outbursts are made in public, and the crazy plans aren't averted. There may just be less for the chroniclers to reveal.

Whatever the explanation, the numbers don't lie. Several solidly reported and well-reviewed volumes on Trump's interregnum and reelection, such as Meridith McGraw's Trump in Exile and Alex Isenstadt's Revenge: The Inside Story of Trump's Return to Power, didn't even dent the hardcover-nonfiction list. Another, 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, by three star politics reporters, briefly flashed onto the Times list before quickly vanishing. Even Wolff is no longer a sure thing. After three previous appearances atop the Times list, his account of the 2024 election, All or Nothing: How Trump Recaptured America, reached only No. 10 upon its debut. It fell off the list after a week and didn't return.

The once-reliable subgenre of Trump-the-conqueror volumes, designed to appeal to his base, has also lost its juice. After 10 years of Trump the politician, even readers who were once hungry to learn about the man they'd voted for seem to have had their fill. Newt Gingrich's Trump's Triumph lasted only two weeks on the nonfiction chart in June. Despite cable-news attention, The Greatest Comeback Ever, by the Fox News commentator Joe Concha, was a one-week wonder in May. So was the CNN pundit Scott Jennings's A Revolution of Common Sense, published in November. Eric Trump's Under Siege: My Family's Fight to Save Our Nation landed in the top spot in November, but lasted only three weeks on the list. The one certifiable hit has been Melania Trump's eponymous memoir.

“Coming out cold with a Trump book right now would probably be a tougher sell than it was five years ago,” the ABC News journalist Jonathan Karl told me. “The world is not obsessing about Trump's actions today the way they were during his first term. Many people have tuned out.” Karl is the author of several best-selling books about the Trump epoch. Despite well-attended promotional appearances, however, his most recent volume—Retribution: Donald Trump and the Campaign That Changed America—lasted only a week on the Times nonfiction list in November.

The hot topic in political publishing over the past year seems to have been Trump's 2024 opponents, not Trump—perhaps because readers were more interested in understanding how the Democrats botched things so badly. Original Sin, Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's account of Joe Biden's physical and cognitive decline, was a best seller for much of the summer. Kamala Harris's memoir about the 2024 election, 107 Days, is still on the chart after three months. No recent book about Trump has approached those numbers.

Kamala Harris: The constant battle

“These are some really terrific books with important reporting in them, but it just seems like the public is exhausted at the moment,” the New York Times White House reporter Peter Baker told me. “They're inundated with Trump at every hour of the day, and they may want to use their personal reading time for something more escapist.” Baker and his wife, the New Yorker columnist Susan Glasser, co-wrote The Divider: Trump in the White House 2017–2021, a top-selling title in 2022.

I have had my own encounter with the shifting economics of Trump-focused nonfiction. A proposal I wrote for a Trump-centric book last year was met with utter indifference. One editor responded to my agent with kind words for my pitch, but explained: “We've been struggling with books on Trump. I think readers have hit a wall with the relentless coverage of him and his policies. We're not seeing book sales on this subject so I'm going to pass.”

That's not to say there won't be more to come. Baker, for one, thinks the current lull is temporary. Ultimately, he said, “Trump is such a consequential figure for our society that there's still a lot of room for future books that capture his role in history.” Indeed, two of Baker's Times colleagues, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan, are at work on a book focusing on the first year of Trump's second term. The thing about Trump is that he's always “too much and never enough,” to quote the title of Mary Trump's 2020 book about her uncle. It sold more than a million copies.

Here's how tensions escalated between the US and Venezuela before Saturday's strikes.

President Donald Trump announced Saturday morning that the United States has captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, saying that the US had flown Maduro to a military ship off the country's coast and will be taking him to New York.

The capture of Maduro was part of a military operation that included “large-scale strikes” on Venezuela, Trump said.

It comes after months of escalating rhetoric and action from the US against Venezuela and speculation about US military action against the Venezuelan government. Since the fall, the US has been striking alleged drug boats. On December 30, the US government announced that the CIA had conducted a drone strike inside Venezuela.

Much is still unknown about Saturday's military operation, the future of Venezuela, and what the US might do next in the region. But understanding what might happen next starts with how the situation escalated to this point.

Venezuela's socialist regime has been a thorn in the side of US presidential administrations since the days of Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez, who first took power in 1999. Venezuela has opposed US influence in Latin America, and allied itself with US adversaries like Cuba, Iran, Russia, and numerous militant groups opposed to US policy.

Since 2013, when Chavez died and Maduro succeeded him, Venezuela's oil-dependent economy has been in a tailspin, with hyperinflation and mass unemployment. Organized crime and corruption are rampant, the government has cracked down on opposition parties and civil society, and Venezuelans have become the world's largest refugee population.

Most relevant for the current crisis, Venezuela has also become a major trans-shipment point for Andean cocaine bound for the US, West Africa, and Europe.

During Trump's first term as president, his administration took a variety of actions — overt and covert — to pressure Maduro to leave office. When he returned to office in 2025, Trump initially looked like he was going to try to have a more productive relationship with Maduro, seeking deals on detained US citizens, refugee returns, and access for US firms to Venezuela's oil fields.

But Trump soon put a stop to those early talks and dialed up the pressure on Maduro to leave. This was likely at least partly driven by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a longtime outspoken Maduro critic since his days in the Senate.

The US considers Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to be the head of a “narcoterrorist cartel.” Maduro's regime is undoubtedly corrupt and autocratic, but not all the US allegations hold up. The administration accuses Maduro of intentionally flooding the US with drugs and criminals, and of effectively controlling prison gangs like Tren de Aragua.

While the Venezuelan government has well-documented ties to crime, Maduro is almost certainly not personally directing drug shipments. Meanwhile, Tren de Aragua, a fixation of Trump's dating back to his presidential campaign, is almost certainly not involved in transnational trafficking. Trump has also suggested, misleadingly, that Venezuela is tied to fentanyl production.

Ultimately, different players in the Trump administration may be interested in Venezuela for different reasons, but as an emblematic country for migration, drug trafficking, and socialism, it sits within the Venn diagram of the administration's priorities.

The ability to actually change your life is a very modern kind of progress. Here how to make it real in 2026.

It's January 3. The gyms are suddenly crowded; the freshly bought journals are pristine; and suddenly, everyone you know is trying to learn Italian like they're about to become a deep-cover spy in Tuscany. It's the new year, new you, new everything.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

Or, at least, it is for a few days. January 9, the second Friday of the month this year, is colloquially known as “Quitter's Day,” because it's the date nearly half of all people abandon their New Year's resolutions.

It's enough to make you wonder why we bother in the first place. But the New Year is one of the few moments when our culture collectively agrees that it's normal to try to change. Behavioral scientists even have a name for it: the “fresh start effect,” the idea that temporal landmarks — a new year, a birthday, a Monday — can make people feel like they're opening a new chapter, which can translate into change.

The opportunity to change — whether it's a change of habits, change of skills, or change of communities, or even far bigger changes like changing careers or religion — is really a modern privilege. Even today, not everyone has that freedom, and no one has it equally, but for a huge slice of the people reading this story, our range of plausible life trajectories is far wider than it was for the vast bulk of human history, when life paths were far more limited and largely fixed at birth.

So, this New Year's, let's ignore the cynics and embrace the freedom to change. To help you along, I've gathered five evidence-based tactics designed to help your resolutions survive contact with real life and to help you take advantage of your historically unusual ability to chart your own life.

Why do most resolutions fail? Because they're vibes, not actual behavior. “Get in shape.” “Be healthier.” “Write more.” Those aren't actions; they're umbrella identities with disputed borders, which means every day trying to live up to them in all their vague glory becomes an enervating negotiation. How much “more” counts as “writing more”? Exactly what shape are you trying to get into, and how many edges can it have?

So, instead, make the goal so small — but so specific — that it can't be argued. Ten minutes of meditation, two pages of journaling, one lap around the park, one email to that friend you haven't seen in too long. The aim here is not to transform overnight; it's to get you repeating a behavior.

Here's a quick test: If you can't describe your habit in one sentence that includes the all-important words when and where, it's not ready yet. If this feels like lowering your standards, that's okay. What you're trying to do is lower the threshold for action, so you can build up from a solid foundation.

A resolution powered by motivation is basically a weather-dependent infrastructure plan. Sometimes that's literal (“it's too cold to get that run in”) and sometimes it's psychological (“I'm too down to get that run in”). If you're waiting to feel motivated, you're betting your habit on the one ingredient you control the least — whereas you can almost always increase “ability” by shrinking the task (see tip No. 1), and you can engineer the “prompt” by tying it to a stable cue.

So try this format:

After I [existing routine], I will [tiny habit].

Pick an anchor that's mechanical and reliable — coffee brewing, shower ending, laptop opening — not something fuzzy like “after dinner,” which changes shape depending on how chaotic your day is. The key is to contextualize your habits.

What's the biggest difference between disciplined and undisciplined people? Undisciplined people count on discipline; disciplined people count on plans.

What psychologists call implementation intentions — “If X happens, then I will do Y” — can help reinforce habits because they essentially act as pre-decisions. Instead of relying on non-renewable willpower (see tip No. 2), you decide in advance what you'll do when a reliable cue appears — or just as important, if a reliable problem pops up.

Write two if-then plans in advance:

The point here is to limit the pressure you're putting on your future self — who, after all, is the poor guy who has to fulfill all these resolutions — by planning ahead for what could go wrong.

A goal that lives only in your head is easy to renegotiate at 11:47 pm. Two simple ways to resist that temptation are feedback and accountability.

Self-monitoring shows up again and again as a core component of successful behavior change programs, with research demonstrating that more frequent tracking is consistently associated with better outcomes. This does not mean you have to become a quantified-self maximalist, though admittedly, I'm writing as someone who gets three separate sleep scores each night. But you do need a way to make the desired behavior visible.

Pick one metric you can record in under 30 seconds:

But, the real secret sauce of accountability is when you add in additional eyes. So enlist a witness:

“Hey — I'm doing X for January. Can I text you a ✅ when I do it? No need to respond.” (Just don't send this text at 11:47 pm.)

This is the modern, low-touch version of a very old technology to encourage good habits: regular meetings and structured belonging.

Let's end by going to the other side of the resolution spectrum: the big stuff — new career direction, a move to a different city, a spiritual shift. The common mistake is treating such massive changes as a binary, irreversible decision, which can cause you to freeze under the uncertainty.

Instead of thinking you have no choice but to stay or go, run a pilot — a time-boxed, reversible experiment that lets you try the change at a smaller scale before you reorganize your whole life around it. The point isn't to “prove” you'll succeed; it's to collect real information. What does this path actually feel like on a Tuesday? What obstacles show up? Do you get energy from it, or do you mostly dread it? Does it create momentum, or does it drain you?

Break it into four parts:

The point of all this is to make change less moralistic and more mechanical. You design a better default, then practice it until it feels like you.

If you're lucky enough to have some real freedom — the ability to choose new habits, new skills, maybe even a new path — that is itself a kind of progress worth recognizing. This New Year can just be the one where you cash in that psychological coupon gifted by many centuries of progress and build the kind of change that lasts through Quitter's Day and well beyond.

The fentanyl crisis gets more attention — but production and trade in cocaine is surging worldwide.

The Trump administration has been telling Americans that fentanyl is so widespread, it's a “weapon of mass destruction.“ But according to the Washington Post's Mexico City bureau chief Samantha Schmidt, fentanyl isn't the drug the administration should be paying attention to — it's cocaine.

Globally, supply and demand for the drug are surging, according to Schmidt. And that's happening amid a changed cocaine landscape, one that's evolved from the kingpin-run trade of the '80s. The drug might conjure images of Pablo Escobar and Al Pacino's Scarface, but today's reality is less the big bad coke boss and more like a proliferation of smaller outfits trafficking in cocaine.

As Schmidt told Today, Explained cohost Jonquilyn Hill, “It is a much more globalized business than before, and it works in an entirely new way that makes it much more difficult to combat.”

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

How big is the global cocaine trade right now?

Year after year it is breaking records. The land in Colombia that is used to cultivate cocaine is about more than five times the size than during the Pablo Escobar years. Today it is so much bigger, and we see both demand and supply surging in many parts of the world.

Seizures in Europe [are] growing to levels that now rival the United States as a main destination point. Pablo Escobar was killed in 1993, so up until that point, that was when the United States was really focused on cocaine and trying to tackle the cocaine trade and the cartels moving it.

But that was a very different era. Now it is globalized. We are talking about a proliferation of smaller, much more nimble, very strategic drug trafficking organizations across South America.

What's driving that growth?

We are seeing demand soaring in countries that previously were not considered main markets. Europe now is a top destination alongside the United States.

Some of it is also supply-side. We are seeing within Colombia just the amount of land with cocaine, and the productivity of that land, is so much higher than before. And when you talk to experts, some of that is explained by the way that they've created these cocaine enclaves where they not only have much more productive land, they grow a lot more of the crop (the base plant is called coca). It's way more productive, and they've managed to concentrate these enclaves near the borders and near the coasts so they can quickly move it out.

And before, we had one or two main armed groups that controlled the trade in Colombia. Now because of the peace negotiations in 2016 and the collapse of those peace negotiations and the aftermath of that, it's also sort of opened up the country to criminal networks from around the world.

We're talking about how the trade has expanded via cultivation methods and diversified markets and logistics. It feels like we're talking about any other kind of business.

Absolutely. Much of this is happening on legal container ships. Sometimes you do see these crazy stories about these submarines ending up in Australia, and these go-fast boats in the Caribbean, but a lot of times it's legal container ships that are leaving through legal ports.

A lot of what has also allowed this explosion in the cocaine trade is corruption. It's buying off people in the ports, in the police, in the courts. So it's going to be a lot harder to get rid of this when it has infiltrated every level of the state.

How is law enforcement dealing with this new era of the cocaine trade?

So the answer to that depends on whether you're talking about last year or this year under the Trump administration.

Last year I think the focus was on trying to dismantle the criminal structures from the top. Fast-forward to this year, and in the current moment we're in, the Trump administration has taken a vastly different approach. They have had this massive buildup of the military in particular, the Navy in the Caribbean, and in many parts of the waters in Latin America, and have been bombing drug boats at sea that they allege are drug traffickers moving drugs to the United States.

The Trump administration is saying that this is a threat, that these are “narco terrorists” flooding the United States with drugs, and they talk about it in a way that implies that fentanyl is moving on these boats when we know that it is predominantly cocaine.

We don't really hear the Trump administration talking about cocaine and the specifics of that trade as much as we hear them talk about the fentanyl crisis. So we're kind of conflating two things here.

Warren Buffett has officially retired as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO after six decades in charge. Close watchers say Greg Abel, who took the reins on New Year's Day, faces three key challenges.

Abel's biggest hurdle will be ""finding a way to intelligently allocate"" Berkshire's vast and growing cash pile, Alex Morris, the author of ""Buffett and Munger Unscripted"" and the founder of investment research service TSOH, told Business Insider.

Berkshire's trove of cash, Treasury bills, and other liquid assets recently breached $350 billion — a figure that exceeds the market values of Home Depot, Procter & Gamble, and General Electric.

Read more about the leadership transition underway at Berkshire Hathaway:

Abel could use Berkshire's war chest to fund stock buybacks, acquire other businesses, or pay dividends to shareholders, Morris said.

Yet Buffett hasn't found any of those to be fruitful avenues in recent years. Berkshire hasn't repurchased shares in its past five reported quarters, only paid a dividend on one occasion under Buffett, in 1967, and has made few material acquisitions in the past 15 years.

As a business icon and legendary investor, Buffett was given ""more of a pass"" by Wall Street and Berkshire shareholders for hoarding cash than Abel is likely to receive, Morris said.

""Finding a solution here is challenging,"" he continued, before suggesting Abel might consider a one-off special dividend.

Prior to becoming CEO, Abel headed up Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, including Berkshire Hathaway Energy and the BNSF Railway.

Abel is recognized as a world-class operator, but that's ""fundamentally different from identifying accretive acquisitions in the public and private markets,"" Luke Rahbari, the CEO of Equity Armor Investments, told Business Insider.

Buffett and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, designed Berkshire as a web of decentralized, autonomous subsidiaries, freeing them to spend much of their days reading corporate filings and searching for compelling investments.

""Greg Abel will not have the time to do this,"" David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland, told Business Insider.

Kass said the new boss will have a ""full plate"" overseeing Berkshire's subsidiaries, including insurers such as Geico for the first time, managing its roughly $300 billion stock portfolio, and making major allocation decisions outside of the company including acquisitions and other deals.

Buffett and Munger built Berkshire's culture around core values such as trust, honesty, patience, discipline, and long-term thinking.

They delegated ""almost to the point of abdication,"" they told shareholders in their Owner's Manual. The company had nearly 400,000 employees at the end of 2024, but only 27 worked in its Omaha headquarters, per its latest annual report.

Abel is expected to be a more hands-on manager than Buffett. He's already announced several leadership changes, including the appointment of Berkshire's first general counsel and a new divisional president.

""The challenge will be institutionalizing the culture while professionalizing a headquarters that has historically been intentionally lean,"" Rahbari said.

He added that Abel doesn't have Buffett's track record and will have to earn the trust awarded to his predecessor.

""Abel will have to navigate complex relationships with subsidiary management teams where the 'loyalty discount' previously given to Buffett may no longer apply,"" he said.

President Donald Trump said the U.S. is going to temporarily take over governing Venezuela after launching a large-scale surprise attack on the country overnight.

""We are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,"" Trump said in a press conference Saturday morning from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.

The Venezuela operation ""was one of the most stunning, effective and powerful displays of American military,"" Trump said. 

""Not a single American service member was killed, and not a single piece of American equipment was lost, many helicopters, many planes, many people involved in that fight,"" Trump also said.

U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The couple have been indicted in the Southern District of New York on drug-trafficking charges.

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, said the mission involved ""more than 150 aircraft launching across the western hemisphere in political coordination, all coming together in time and place to layer effects for a single purpose, to get an interdiction force into downtown Caracas, while maintaining the element of tactical surprise."" 

Trump said the U.S. would be in charge of Venezuela until there is a safe transition of leadership. He also said the U.S. would be running the country ""with a group"" and ""designating various people,"" without providing details. 

According to Trump, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as president and had been in contact with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 

""She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,"" Trump said. Rubio added that Congress was not briefed ahead of the operation.

A federal indictment charging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, his wife and four other people with narco-terrorism conspiracy and other charges was unsealed and posted online by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday morning after the couple's dramatic capture by American forces in their own country.

""For over 25 years, leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States,"" the indictment alleges.

The indictment was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. In addition to Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, the indictment also charges Maduro's son, Nicolas Ernesto Maduoro Guerra, Diosado Cabello Rondon, Ramon Rodriguez Chachin, and Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores. Read the indictment here.

""Nicolas Maduro Moros, the defendant, now sits atop a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking,"" the indictment said.

""That drug trafficking has enriched and entrenched Venezuela's political and military elite, including Minister of the Interior, Justice and Peace Diosado Cabello Rondon, the defendant, and former  Minister of the Interior and Justice Ramon Rodriguez Chachin, the defendant.""

Guerrero was identified as the leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

In addition to the narco-terrorism conspiracy charge, the indictment alleges four other criminal counts: cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machine guns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.

Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, blasted the attack on Venezuela and its rationale

""If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn't be tweeting that they've arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law,"" Massie wrote in a post on the social media site X.

In this article

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)

Warren Buffett told CNBC's Becky Quick he would rather have new Berkshire Hathaway CEO Greg Abel handle his money ""than any of the top investment advisers or any of the top CEOs in the United States.""

Buffett's shares in the company are currently valued at $147.5 billion, so by managing Berkshire, Abel will, in effect, also be managing almost all of Buffett's enormous net worth.

Quick interviewed Buffett in May, just a few days after he announced he planned to step down as CEO at year-end. Wednesday was his last day on the job, although he will remain chairman of the board and still plans to come to the office every day.

CNBC aired short excerpts on Friday from that conversation to help promote a special program later this month that will feature the entire interview.

In the clips, Buffett promised Abel will be ""the decider,"" and will be able to get more done in a week than he himself can accomplish in a month.

He praised Abel for not being a ""distorted individual,"" saying he ""lives what would look like a normal life"" even though he will run a company with 400 thousand employees that ""has a better chance ... of being here a hundred years from now than any company I can think of.""

And while Buffett won't be on stage at this May's annual meeting, he suggested to Becky that ""maybe you'll interview me"" during CNBC's coverage of the event.

Here's video of Becky's report on the interview from Friday's ""Squawk Box,"" along with the text of Buffett's interview excerpts.

WARREN BUFFETT: Everything will be the same. You know, I will come in.

I won't — I won't be up there speaking at the annual meeting, but I'll be in the directors' section.

Maybe you'll interview me at — (laughs) — at half-time or something of the sort, who knows?

But Greg will be the decider. [I] can't imagine how much more he can get accomplished in a week than I can [in] a month. I mean, he just —

And at the same time, he's not a distorted individual. You know, I mean, he — he likes to play ice hockey with his kids.

And ... he lives what would look like a normal life. And my guess is if the neighbors didn't know who know who he was, they wouldn't have any idea that — that on — on January 1st, he's going to be the decider on a company that — that employs close to 400 thousand people and has got plans around — to be around fifty or a hundred years from now.

And who knows what'll happen? But it has a better chance, I think, of being here a hundred years from now than any company I can think of.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARREN BUFFETT: And Greg's operated more than I have when you get right down to it.

I mean, he's gone over to England to run something. He went to — you know — we — he came to Omaha one time to run a business for a few years.

And it — he knows — there's no secret formula that — that — only CEOs have or anything of the sort.

So, I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States.

BECKY QUICK: That is a huge endorsement.

WARREN BUFFETT: It is a huge endorsement, but it's an endorsement we've made. (Laughs)

And — and I am going to have him handling the money of the, you know, in effect, I —

He knows business. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Later in the day on ""Money Matters,"" a section of the interview was replayed, followed by CNBC's Senior Markets Commentator Michael Santoli's thoughts on Berkshire's well-telegraphed transition to a new CEO.

The entire interview will be featured on a special program, ""Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy,"" scheduled to air on CNBC on Tuesday, January 13 at 7 pm ET.

Both classes of Berkshire Hathaway stock moved somewhat lower on the first trading day with Greg Abel as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.

The A shares closed Friday with a 1.4% drop while the B shares did slightly better, falling almost 1.2%.

The benchmark S&P 500 index, on the other hand, moved higher during 2026's first Wall Street session, but it ended with just a small gain of 0.2%.

That gives the S&P an extremely early lead of 1.60 percentage points over BRKA year-to-date.

With S&P dividends included, the metric Berkshire uses for comparisons in its annual reports, the lead is 1.62 percentage points.

For 2025, the S&P with dividends outperformed Berkshire's A shares by 7.0 percentage points.

Airlines canceled flights throughout the Caribbean on Saturday following U.S. strikes on Venezuela after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered commercial aircraft to avoid airspace in parts of the region.

President Donald Trump said Saturday the U.S. strikes resulted in the capture and removal of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro.

U.S. airlines canceled hundreds of flights to airports in Puerto Rico and Aruba, according to flight tallies from FlightAware and carriers' sites. The canceled flights included close to 300 flights to and from San Juan, Puerto Rico's Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, more than 40% of the day's schedule, according to FlightAware.

""American Airlines is aware of the airspace closures in the Eastern Caribbean that were issued in the middle of the night and is closely monitoring the situation with the FAA,"" the carrier said in a statement. ""We are making schedule adjustments as necessary with the safety and security of our customers and team members top of mind.""

Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways also showed cancellations in the Caribbean.

JetBlue, which has a large operation in the Caribbean, said it canceled about 215 flights ""due to airspace closures across the Caribbean related to military activity."" The airline noted that flights to the Dominican Republic and Jamaica were not affected by government restrictions.

It wasn't immediately clear how long the disruptions would last, though such broad restrictions are often temporary.

Airlines said they would waive change fees and fare differences for customers affected by the airspace closures who could fly later in the month.

Major U.S. airlines haven't served Venezuela directly for years. American was the last of the major U.S. carriers to stop flying to the country in 2019 amid unrest there.

Russia and Iran broadly condemned the U.S. attack on Venezuela early Saturday, while elsewhere, world leaders called for an immediate meeting of the UN Security Council.

The Russian foreign ministry called Saturday's strikes on Venezuela ""an act of armed aggression"" that is ""deeply concerning and condemnable.""

""The pretexts used to justify such actions are unfounded ...In the current situation, it is important, first and foremost, to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue.""

""Latin America must remain a zone of peace, as it declared itself to be in 2014. And Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, interference from outside.""

The ministry said it was joining Venezuelan authorities and leaders of Latin American countries in calling for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council.

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva condemned the U.S. military attack on its neighbor, Venezuela, and said the capture of his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro, crossed ""an unacceptable line.""

""These acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela's sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community,"" Lula said in a post on X.

Lula also called for a ""vigorous"" response from the United Nations, adding that Brazil remains open to promoting dialogue and cooperation.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said the U.S. is ""arrogantly trying to impose something on the country, on the officials, on the government, and on the nation"" of Venezuela.

""We will not yield to the enemy,"" he said.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro, in a social media post on X, called for a meeting of the UN Security Council, saying the U.S. attack is an ""aggression against the sovereignty of Venezuela and Latin America."" 

Petro said Colombia also said it is deploying forces to the border ""in case of a massive influx of refugees.""

Kaja Kallas, EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said in a post on X that the European Union is closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela.

""I have spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and our Ambassador in Caracas... The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition,"" she said. 

""Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint. The safety of EU citizens in the country is our top priority,"" Kallas added.

The United States' military operation runs counter to the principles of international law, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said.

""The military operation that led to the capture of Nicolas Maduro violates the principle of not resorting to force, that underpins international law. France reiterates that no lasting political solution can be imposed from the outside and that only sovereign people themselves can decide their future,"" wrote Barrot on X.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said international law must be respected.

""Dramatic development in Venezuela, which we are following closely. We need to get back on track toward de-escalation and dialogue,"" Rasmussen wrote on X.

In Germany, Roderich Kiesewetter, a prominent member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, called the U.S. attack a ""coup.""

""With President [Donald] Trump, the U.S. are abandoning the rules-based order that has shaped us since 1945,"" he said. ""The coup in Venezuela marks a return to the old U.S. doctrine from before 1940: a mindset of thinking in terms of spheres of influence, where the law of force rules, not international law.""

Kiesewetter added: ""Trump is destroying what was left of any trust in the U.S.""

Maxime Prevot, Belgium's deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, said the safety of its citizens in Venezuels is the European country's top priority.

""Our embassy in Bogotá, which is responsible for Venezuela, and our services in Brussels are fully mobilized. The situation is being closely monitored, in coordination with our European partners.""

The Spanish foreign ministry urged the U.S. to de-escalate hostilities. 

""In this regard, Spain is willing to offer its good offices to achieve a peaceful and negotiated solution to the current crisis,"" it said in a statement.

Giuseppe Conte, a former prime minister and current opposition party leader in Italy, said the U.S. operation ""has no legal basis."" 

""We are facing a blatant violation of international law, which certifies the dominance of the strongest and best equipped militarily... I hope that the entire international community will make its voice heard and that everyone will understand that if rules only apply to enemies and not to friends, no one can feel safe anymore. Nor can the illiberal nature of a government's rule justify an attack to a sovereign state.""

Yvonne Mewengkang, spokesperson for Indonesia's foreign ministry, said it is monitoring developments to ensure the safety of its citizens in Venezuela.

""Indonesia also calls on all relevant parties to prioritize peaceful resolution through de-escalation and dialogue, while prioritizing the protection of civilians.""

""Indonesia emphasizes the importance of respecting international law and the principles of the UN Charter.""

In Trinidad and Tobago, Prime Minister Kamala Persad-Bissessar made clear that the country is not participating in U.S. military operations in Venezuela. 

""Trinidad and Tobago continues to maintain peaceful relations with the people of Venezuela,"" Persad-Bissessar said.

U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife during a stunning, large-scale attack on their nation overnight. American authorities said Saturday morning that the couple had been indicted in New York on drug-trafficking charges.

The U.S. military operation was conducted in coordination with American law enforcement authorities, U.S. President Donald Trump said in an early morning post on Truth Social. 

""The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement,"" Trump said.

Trump is expected to discuss the attack on Venezuela in a press conference at 11 a.m. ET. Prior to the start of the press conference, the president apparently posted a video of the operation on Truth Social.  

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.

The Maduros have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of weapons and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices against the U.S., according to Bondi's post.

""They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,"" she wrote.

CBS News reported that the U.S. Army's elite Delta Force unit was involved in the capture of Maduro.

In an interview with ""Fox and Friends Weekend"" on Saturday, Trump said the U.S. suffered a few injuries but no deaths in the operation, and that U.S. forces waited four days to launch the attack due to weather conditions.

Trump also said Maduro and his wife were flown to the USS Iwo Jima following their capture and will head to New York to face the narco-terrorism charges. 

""They'll be heading to New York...They're on a ship, and they'll be heading into New York. The helicopter took them out,"" the president said.

The Pentagon declined to answer CNBC's queries and referred questions to the White House. The White House, which reposted Trump's Truth Social statement on its X account, didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who had earlier questioned whether the U.S. attack was constitutional, said in a X post on Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him the U.S. operation ""was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant.""

""This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,"" Lee added.

Rubio, meanwhile, responded to the operation on social media by reposting a statement he made in July 2025, stating: ""Maduro is NOT the President of Venezuela and his regime is NOT the legitimate government. Maduro is the head of the Cartel de Los Soles, a narco-terror organization which has taken possession of a country. And he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States.""

U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said in a post on X that Maduro would ""finally face justice for his crimes.""

There was no immediate confirmation from the Venezuelan government. 

Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's vice president, demanded that the U.S. provide proof that Maduro and his wife are alive, in an interview on state television station Venezolana de Televisión.

Maduro's official Facebook page posted a video stating that attacks occurred in the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, according to a Google translation of the Spanish-language statement.

The statement in the video added that the U.S. would fail in its goal of possessing Venezuela's oil and minerals, and that Maduro had declared a national emergency and mobilized defense forces.

The official spokesperson for Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who leads the  Venezuelan opposition, said in a post on X that it had no comment on the operation.

Trump told The New York Times that the operation was a result of ""a lot of good planning."" 

""It was a brilliant operation, actually,"" Trump told the Times.

Explosions were reported in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, at about 2 a.m. local time (0600 GMT), according to images circulating on social media that could not be independently verified.

Venezuelan state-run energy company PDVSA's oil production and refining were normal, and its key facilities had suffered no damage, according to an initial assessment, two sources with knowledge of the company's operations told Reuters.

The port of La Guaira near Caracas, one of the country's largest but is not used for oil operations, was reported to have suffered severe damage, Reuters reported.

Trump has repeatedly threatened action against Maduro. On Dec. 23, 2025, he said it would be ""smart"" for Maduro to leave power.

Trump last month announced a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of Venezuelan waters, saying the country was ""completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America.""

The strategy to pressure Maduro comes as the U.S. and Venezuela's opposition say Maduro rigged an election last year to stay in power. Trump has also accused Maduro of running a ""narco-state.""

Colombian President Gustavo Petro said in a post on X that Caracas was under attack and urged an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States and the United Nations.

Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Chavez in 2013, has said Washington is seeking control of its oil reserves, the largest in the world.

A company controlled by a Chinese national was ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday to unwind a $2.9 million acquisition of chip assets from a U.S. manufacturer, citing national security concerns.

The White House said in an executive order that HieFo Corporation, incorporated in Delaware, was ""controlled by a citizen of the People's Republic of China.""

HieFo acquired the digital chips and related wafer design, fabrication, and processing businesses of New Jersey-based Emcore on April 30, 2024, which included a semiconductor manufacturing facility, the Treasury Department said in a separate statement.

The potential diversion of the supply of indium phosphide chips manufactured by Emcore's digital chips business away from the U.S. was also identified as a national security risk, the Treasury Department added.

HieFo and Emcore did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

The Global Times, a Chinese government mouthpiece, citing an expert, said the divestment order ""reflects Washington's anxiety over technology competition with China"" as it was made without a convincing rationale.

The Treasury Department said the deal was not notified to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, prompting a review by its non-notified transactions team.

""CFIUS identified a national security risk arising from the transaction relating to potential access to EMCORE's intellectual property, proprietary know-how, and expertise,"" the Treasury Department said.

HieFo was ordered to divest all acquired assets within 180 days and to immediately restrict access to Emcore's technical information.

In a statement dated Sept. 2, 2024, HieFo said the deal would allow operations to continue at Emcore's facility in Alhambra, California, and that it had ""successfully engaged"" nearly all key scientists, engineers and operational staff.

HieFo was founded by Genzao Zhang and Harry Moore through a management buyout of wafer fabrication and chip-related assets from Emcore. Both founders list their start dates at HieFo as May 2024 on LinkedIn, when the acquisition closed.

The company claimed it had inherited more than 40 years of optoelectronic innovation in indium phosphide chip manufacturing.

Emcore manufactures navigation equipment such as gyroscopes and sensors used in commercial, industrial and defense applications, including autonomous navigation and weapons systems, according to its website.

The company was delisted from Nasdaq in early 2025 following its merger with aerospace manufacturing holding company Velocity One LP in November 2024.

SAN FRANCISCO — Inside Anthropic headquarters, President and co-founder Daniela Amodei keeps coming back to a phrase that's become a sort of governing principle for the artificial intelligence startup's entire strategy: Do more with less.

It's a direct challenge to the prevailing mood across Silicon Valley, where the biggest labs and their backers are treating scale as destiny. 

Firms are raising record sums, locking up chips years in advance, and pouring concrete across the American heartland for data centers in the belief that the company that builds the largest intelligence factory will win.

OpenAI has become the clearest example of that approach. 

The company has made roughly $1.4 trillion in headline compute and infrastructure commitments as it works with partners to stand up massive data center campuses and secure next-generation chips at a pace the industry has never seen.

Anthropic's pitch is that there's another way through the race, one where disciplined spending, algorithmic efficiency, and smarter deployment can keep you at the frontier without trying to outbuild everyone else.

""I think what we have always aimed to do at Anthropic is be as judicious with the resources that we have while still operating in this space where it's just a lot of compute,"" Amodei told CNBC. ""Anthropic has always had a fraction of what our competitors have had in terms of compute and capital, and yet, pretty consistently, we've had the most powerful, most performant models for the majority of the past several years.""

Daniela Amodei and her brother, Dario Amodei, who is Anthropic's CEO and a Baidu and Google alumni, helped build the very worldview they're now betting against.

Dario Amodei was among the researchers who helped popularize the scaling paradigm that has guided the modern model race. It is the strategy that increasing compute, data, model size, and capabilities tends to improve the model in a predictable way.

That pattern has effectively become the financial bedrock of the AI arms race. 

It underwrites hyperscaler capital spending, justifies towering chip valuations, and keeps private markets willing to assign enormous prices to companies that are still spending heavily to reach profitability.

But even as Anthropic has benefited from that logic, the company is trying to prove that the next phase of competition won't be decided only by who can afford the largest pre-training runs. 

Its strategy leans into higher-quality training data, post-training techniques that improve reasoning, and product choices designed to make models cheaper to run and easier to adopt at scale — the part of the AI business where the compute bill never stops.

To be clear, Anthropic isn't operating on a shoestring. The company has roughly $100 billion in compute commitments, and expects those requirements to keep rising if it wants to stay at the frontier. 

""The compute requirements for the future are very large,"" Daniela Amodei said. ""So our expectation is, yes, we will need more compute to be able to just stay at the frontier as we get bigger.""

Still, the company argues that the headline numbers flying around the sector are often not directly comparable — and that the industry's collective certainty about the ""right"" amount to spend is less solid than it sounds.

""A lot of the numbers that are thrown around are sort of not exactly apples to apples, because of just how the structure of some of these deals are kind of set up,"" she said, describing an environment where players feel pressure to commit early to secure hardware years down the line. 

The bigger truth, she added, is that even insiders who helped shape the scaling thesis have been surprised by how consistently performance and business growth have compounded.

""We have continued to be surprised, even as the people who pioneered this belief in scaling laws,"" Daniela Amodei said. ""Something that I hear from my colleagues a lot is, the exponential continues until it doesn't. And every year we've been like, 'Well, this can't possibly be the case that things will continue on the exponential' — and then every year it has.""

That line captures both the optimism and the anxiety of today's buildout. 

If the exponential keeps holding, then the companies that lock up power, chips and sites early may look prescient. If it breaks — or if adoption lags behind the pace of capability — then the players that overcommitted could be left carrying years of fixed costs and long-lead-time infrastructure built for demand that never arrives.

Daniela Amodei drew a distinction between the technology curve and the economic curve, an important nuance that tends to get conflated in the public debate. 

From a technological perspective, she said Anthropic doesn't see progress slowing down, based on what the company has observed so far. The more complicated question is how quickly businesses and consumers can integrate those capabilities into real workflows where procurement, change management, and human friction can slow even the best tool.

""Regardless of how good the technology is, it takes time for that to be used in a business or sort of personal context,"" she said. ""The real question to me is: How quickly can businesses in particular, but also individuals, leverage the technology?""

That enterprise emphasis is central to why Anthropic has become such a closely watched bellwether for the broader generative AI trade. 

The company has positioned itself as an enterprise-first model provider, with much of its revenue tied to other companies paying to plug Claude into workflows, products, and internal systems — usage that can be stickier than a consumer app, where churn can rise once the novelty fades.

Anthropic said revenue has grown tenfold year over year for three straight years. And it has built a distribution footprint that's unusual in a market defined by fierce rivalry. The Claude model is available across the major cloud platforms, including through partners that are also building and selling competing models.

Daniela Amodei framed that presence less as détente and more as a reflection of customer pull, with large enterprises wanting optionality across clouds, and cloud providers wanting to offer what their biggest customers are asking to buy.

In practice, that multicloud posture is also a way to compete without making a single infrastructure bet. 

If OpenAI is attempting to anchor a vast buildout around bespoke campuses and dedicated capacity, Anthropic is trying to remain flexible, shifting where it runs based on cost, availability, and customer demand, while focusing internal energy on improving model efficiency and performance per unit of compute.

As 2026 begins, the divide matters for another reason: Both companies are being pushed toward the discipline of public-market readiness while still operating in a private-market world where compute needs are growing faster than certainty.

Anthropic and OpenAI have not announced IPO timelines, but both are making moves that look like preparation, adding finance, governance, forecasting, and an operating cadence that can withstand public scrutiny. 

At the same time, both are still raising fresh capital and striking ever-larger compute arrangements to fund the next leg of model development.

That sets up a real test of strategy rather than rhetoric. 

If the market keeps funding scale, OpenAI's approach may remain the industry standard. If investors start demanding greater efficiency, Anthropic's ""do more with less"" posture could put them at an advantage.

In that sense, Anthropic's contrarian bet isn't that scaling doesn't work. It's that scaling isn't the only lever that matters, and that the winner of the next phase may be the lab that can keep improving while spending in a way the real economy can sustain.

""The exponential continues until it doesn't,"" Daniela Amodei said. The question for 2026 is what happens to the AI arms race — and to the companies building it — if the industry's favorite curve finally stops behaving.

Canada's transport regulator has asked Air India to investigate an incident of a pilot who was removed from a plane before it was due to take off and found to be under the influence of alcohol, a person familiar with the matter said.

Two breathalyser tests conducted by Canadian police at Vancouver International Airport showed the pilot was unfit for duty, the person said on Friday. The incident was labelled as a ""serious matter"" by Transport Canada in a letter to Air India and authorities are likely to pursue enforcement action, the person added.

The person requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. In a statement on Saturday, Transport Canada said it would engage with Air India and India's aviation regulator to ensure ""appropriate follow-up actions"" are taken.

In a statement, Air India said the flight from Vancouver to Delhi on December 23 experienced a last-minute delay due to the incident, adding that an alternate pilot was brought in to operate the flight. The airline said Canadian authorities raised concerns about the pilot's fitness for duty but did not provide details.

""The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations,"" Air India said.

""Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy.""

The aircraft was a Boeing 777, a model that can seat up to 344 passengers, according to the websites of Flightradar24 and Air India.

The letter from Transport Canada official Ajit Oommen has asked Air India to provide its findings and details of steps taken to prevent future occurrences by January 26, the person familiar with the matter said.

Air India has been under intense scrutiny since the June 12 crash of a Boeing Dreamliner killed 260 people. India's aviation regulator has flagged multiple safety lapses at the airline, which was previously owned by the government until 2022.

Pilots at Air India, owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, have also come under scrutiny. This week, India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) sent warning notices to four Air India pilots, flagging ""serious safety concerns"" related to regulatory compliance and flight crew decision-making.

The DGCA said the pilots accepted an aircraft for operation last year despite prior knowledge of ""repeated snags"" and ""existing systems degradations,"" according to warning notices dated December 29 seen by Reuters. The aircraft is a Boeing 787 used for long-haul flights, according to Flightradar24.

The DGCA has proposed tightened rules on alcohol testing for crew members, including one that would have a pilot lose their license permanently after three positive tests. Current rules require post-flight breath-analyzer examinations for each trip to be carried out at the first port of landing in India.

Canadian rules state that a pilot cannot operate an aircraft within 12 hours of consuming an alcoholic beverage. Violation of those rules can lead to judicial or administrative enforcement actions, including fines.

As news spread Saturday of President Donald Trump's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a split screen emerged in Congress: Republicans largely celebrated the military operation, while Democrats condemned the president's actions and questioned their legality. 

After months of pressure on Maduro, Trump announced on Truth Social that the U.S. had assisted in a ""large scale strike"" against the country and its leader, who was captured along with his wife, Cilia Flores, and brought to the U.S. 

""Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war,"" Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., said in a post to X on Saturday.

The Constitution grants Congress primary authority to declare war. The War Powers Resolution, passed in 1973 in response to the Vietnam War, limits the president's ability to unilaterally take military action and requires the president to consult with Congress when troops are deployed.

But lawmakers said the president did not seek approval and did not brief Congress on his plans.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement called the decision to take military action in Venezuela without congressional authorization ""reckless.""

""The administration has assured me three separate times that it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela. Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,"" Schumer said.

Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told MSNOW that he had ""no briefing or heads up. I received all information from the news media at this point."" 

And Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, was among those who cheered the capture of Maduro, but said Congress had not been given any forewarning.

""And that's probably one reason why it didn't leak over these four days,"" Cotton said, in an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" on Saturday. ""Congress isn't notified when the FBI is going to arrest a drug trafficker or cyber criminal here in the United States. Nor should Congress be notified when the executive branch is executing arrests on indicted persons.""

Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday said in a post on X that Maduro and his wife have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.

They have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of weapons and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices against the U.S., according to Bondi's post.

Trump seemed to shrug off concerns about the constitutionality of the attack during a call-in to ""Fox & Friends.""

""The Democrats maybe they'll take a shot... all they do is complain,"" Trump said. ""They should say, 'great job.' They shouldn't say, 'Oh gee, maybe it's not constitutional.' You know, the same old stuff that we've been hearing for years and years and years."" 

The president also said that the attack originally had been planned for earlier in the week but was rescheduled due to weather. No U.S. soldiers were killed in the operation, he said.

During a press conference on Saturday from Mar-a-Lago, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said members of Congress were called immediately after the mission, which he said was ""largely a law enforcement function."" Notifying members ahead of the action could have jeopardized the mission, he said.

""This was not the kind of mission that you can do congressional notification on. It was a trigger-based mission... it's just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say, 'Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days,"" Rubio said. 

""Congress has a tendency to leak. This would not be good. If they leaked... I think it would have been maybe a very different result,"" Trump said at the press conference. 

""Congress will leak, and we don't want leakers,"" he continued.

The Trump administration has ramped-up pressure on the Venezuelan government in recent months, alleging that Maduro is the head of a narco-terror organization. He recently ordered a complete blockade on sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country and has been targeting alleged Venezuelan drug boats.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement that he had spoken ""in the last several hours"" with Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and that the White House was working to schedule briefings with members when Congress is back in session next week.

""President Trump is putting American lives first, succeeding where others have failed, and under his leadership the United States will no longer allow criminal regimes to profit from wreaking havoc and destruction on our country,"" Johnson said.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., called the operation an ""important first step to bring [Maduro] to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States."" Neither Thune nor Johnson, through their offices, responded when asked if Republican leaders had been briefed ahead of the attack.

""I spoke to Secretary Rubio early this morning, and I look forward to receiving further briefings from the administration on this operation as part of its comprehensive counternarcotics strategy when the Senate returns to Washington next week,"" Thune said.

As news of the attack on Venezuela broke early Saturday, there was at least some Republican skepticism.

""I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force,"" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, posted to X.

Hours later, and after a phone call with Rubio, Lee had changed his tune.

""This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,"" Lee said in a subsequent post.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Ga., the former Trump ally who had a falling-out with the president and is resigning from Congress on Jan. 5, was part of a small group within the GOP who questioned the attack. 

""(W)hy is it ok for America to militarily invade, bomb, and arrest a foreign leader but Russia is evil for invading Ukraine and China is bad for aggression against Taiwan? Is it only ok if we do it? (I'm not endorsing Russia or China),"" Greene posted to X on Saturday.

And Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a frequent foil to Trump, questioned the constitutionality of Trump's removal of Maduro.

""If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn't be tweeting that they've arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law,"" Massie posted to X.

Democrats, meanwhile, called for more answers and questioned what might come next for Venezuela, where Maduro has ruled for more than a decade.

""Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, but I have seen no evidence that his presidency poses a threat that would justify military action without Congressional authorization, nor have I heard a strategy for the day after and how we will prevent Venezuela from descending into chaos,"" Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., ranking member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement.

""Secretary Rubio repeatedly denied to Congress that the Administration intended to force regime change in Venezuela. The Administration must immediately brief Congress on its plan to ensure stability in the region,"" Himes continued.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in a statement on Saturday, also said Trump did not properly notify Congress of the military action. He questioned how many American troops would remain on the ground and who would run Venezuela now that Maduro has been deposed.

""Pursuant to the Constitution, the framers gave Congress the sole power to declare war as the branch of government closest to the American people,"" Jeffries said. ""The House and Senate must be briefed immediately and compelling evidence to explain and justify this unauthorized use of military force should be presented forthwith.""

Bitcoin BTCUSD dropped below $90,000 on Saturday as crypto markets reacted to the US military action in Venezuela.

Key points:

Bitcoin attempts to hold recent gains as the US mounts an attack on Venezuela's capital, Caracas.

Traders remain optimistic about the outlook for BTC price action if certain levels hold.

Gold starts to flag on low timeframes as Bitcoin's gains tap 5% since Christmas.

Bitcoin faces “geopolitical pressure” at $90,000

Data from TradingView showed BTC price action reversing after highs near $90,940 on Bitstamp. 

News that the US had launched airstrikes in the Venezuelan capital Caracas were followed by an announcement from President Donald Trump on Truth Social in which he said that Venezuela's President had been captured and “flown out of the country.” 

With traditional markets closed, BTCUSD attempted to preserve some early-year gains ahead of futures returning Sunday.

“We're seeing some short-term selling pressure due to the ongoing US action against Venezuela, but I remain bullish in the near term,” analytics account @Wealthmanager reacted in a post on X.

 

Wealthmanager noted that CME Group's Bitcoin futures market had closed the week above $90,000, potentially providing a new “gap” and corresponding price target to the upside.

Crypto analyst Lennaert Snyder agreed that much hinged on the return of TradFi next week.

“There's a lot of geopolitical tension and next week the big players will return. So we'll probably see more volatility on Bitcoin after the weekend,” he told X followers. 

Crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe, meanwhile, described Bitcoin's latest move as a “classic” Venezuela reaction, maintaining a bullish outlook.

“The direction is clear for January: up we go, as long as Bitcoin remains above the 21-Day MA,” he concluded, referring to the 21-day simple moving average at $87,850. 

BTC price begins to avenge gold bull run

Bulls also looked to Bitcoin's relatively strong performance against gold over the New Year period.

After reaching new all-time highs of $4,551 per ounce on Dec. 26, XAU/USD fell by up to 6% before steadying. At the same time, BTCUSD gained up to 5%.

“An important thing to remember is that the last time Bitcoin started its parabolic rally was after Gold made the top,” trading and analytics resource Bull Theory commented on the topic.

 

As Cointelegraph reported, gold finished 2025 as the year's best-performing major asset, with Bitcoin conversely bringing up the rear despite its own all-time highs in October.

Bitcoin's price recovery was stopped earlier on Saturday morning as the asset dropped from its multi-week peak of $91,000 to under $90,000.

The latest rejection came after reports emerged about several explosions felt across Venezuela's capital, Caracas, which were linked to potential strikes by the United States.

The cause has not been confirmed yet, but US President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned Venezuela of ground strikes, and deployed a navy task force in the Caribbean. Additionally, the BBC reported that the Trump administration was aware of the explosions today, but there's no official statement yet.

The CNN added that several areas of the city were left without power after the explosions, and agency journalists said they could hear the sound of an aircraft.

Although the strikes have not been confirmed to be initiated by the US, BTC's price felt the consequences immediately after the reports started to go live. The asset, which has been prone to experience enhanced volatility in times of attacks between different nations, stood at around $90,500 after it touched $91,000 yesterday.

However, it dumped by over a grand within less than an hour following the first BBC and CNN reports and now sits at $89,500.

Real estate guru Grant Cardone has framed Bitcoin as a generation-defining innovation.

Cardone in a Sunday X post compared Bitcoin to the printing press, automobiles, telephone and the internet, innovations that shaped generations and moved civilization forward. He said these innovations had taken decades to be widely adopted, adding that he expected the same with Bitcoin.

“Bitcoin is a technological invention to advance money,” he said. “Change takes a moment – time validates great innovations.”

Cardone's remarks come as 2025 has challenged Bitcoin's “digital gold” and bull market thesis.

While Bitcoin did surge to a new record price of $126,000 this year, it has since shed most of those gains to most recently trade around $88,000, down 11% in 2025 on the back of tariff panic and jitters around tech stocks.

Cardone turned pro-Bitcoin over the past year, touting the digital asset as a store of value. And he has launched several funds that combine it with real estate, allowing real estate investors to capture its volatility and liquidity.

Cardone said he intends to launch 10 of these funds in total, combining 10,000 BTC with 15,000 apartment units.

Cardone Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Benzinga.

So far, Cardone has launched only three of his planned Bitcoin and real estate funds: the 10X Space Coast Bitcoin Fund, the 10X Miami River Fund, and the 10X Boca Raton Bitcoin Fund.

The 10X Space Coast Bitcoin Fund and the 10X Miami River Fund, launched in December 2024 and May, respectively, have both been oversubscribed. The 10X Space Coast Bitcoin Fund combined 300 apartment units in Melbourne, Florida with $15 million worth of Bitcoin, while the 10X Miami River Fund combined 346 apartments on the Miami River in South Florida with $300 million worth of the asset.

The 10X Boca Raton Bitcoin Fund intends to combine $100 million with 366 apartment units.

Cardone has continued to accumulate Bitcoin amid its recent price struggles, welcoming the opportunity to pick up the asset for cheap with limited orders.

Last month, Cardone disclosed that he had emblazoned the Bitcoin logo on the belly of his private jet as a sign of his commitment.

“I'm not bullish on Real Estate & BTC, I'm committed,” he said at the time.

Oops, something went wrong

Tom Lee's BitMine has locked up nearly $1.6 billion of its Ethereum treasury in staking contracts in just one week, positioning the firm as a major network validator. 

The move further shifts BitMine from a passive ETH holder as it prepares for a major expansion of its authorized share count.

The corporate holder deposited an additional 82,560 ETH into staking protocols on January 2, according to blockchain data tracked by Lookonchain.

https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/2007288618604450262?s=46

This latest tranche brings its total staked inventory to approximately 544,064 ETH—roughly 13% of its 4.07 million ETH stockpile.

By committing these assets to the consensus layer, BitMine aims to generate yield on its holdings. The move effectively turns its balance sheet into a productive instrument rather than a static store of value.

However, the maneuver coincides with a sweeping proposal to restructure the company's capital base to fund what management describes as an Ethereum ""supercycle.""

In a January 2 post on X, BitMine Chairman Tom Lee requested approval to increase the company's authorized shares from 500 million to 50 billion.

While Lee framed the hundredfold increase as a mechanism to facilitate future stock splits and keep the share price near $25, the sheer scale of the authorization suggests broader ambitions.

He notes that a 50 billion share ceiling provides BitMine with an enormous runway to conduct At-The-Market (ATM) equity offerings.

This structure would allow BitMine to sell new stock to fund additional Ethereum purchases aggressively.

He argued that BitMine could take advantage of the NAV premium, or the gap between the share price and the value of its underlying assets.

However, it could also dilute existing shareholders.

Nonetheless, Lee outlined scenarios in which ETH could reach $250,000, driven by Wall Street's tokenization trends.

""We believe Ethereum is the future of finance. A supercycle drive by Wall Street re-engineering on the blockchain. Major Wall Street leaders agree. BlackRock's Larry Fink said tokenization is the next evolution of global markets. And the vast majority of tokenization is happening on Ethereum,"" Lee said.

At those valuations, BitMine argues its implied share price could reach $5,000, necessitating splits of up to 100-for-1 to maintain retail accessibility.

With the S&P 500's bullish kickoff, smart money is flowing into these high-volume blockchain stocks, hunting for big growth.

In this guide, we spotlight 7 high-volume blockchain stocks ready to ride the wave. Each one boasts millions of shares traded daily, deep blockchain ties, solid recent performance, and huge upside potential. Whether you're a crypto fan or tech stock chaser, these picks could supercharge your portfolio in 2025.

The S&P 500's strong open isn't happening in a vacuum. Lower interest rates, robust corporate earnings, and cooling inflation are fueling the rally. Crypto markets are syncing up too. Bitcoin smashed records in late 2024 and shows no signs of slowing. Ethereum's latest upgrades are drawing fresh hype. Blockchain companies cash in on this momentum.

Key drivers include:

We focused on stocks with average daily volume over 5 million shares. This ensures smooth trading and real market demand. Let's dive into the top 7.

Coinbase leads the pack as America's biggest crypto exchange. It offers hundreds of coins, easy trading tools, and secure wallets. Revenue pours in from trading fees, which spike during bull runs.

Volume spotlight: Often 10+ million shares daily.

Why surge now? Bitcoin ETFs rely on Coinbase for custody. User numbers are exploding. Last quarter's earnings crushed expectations. With S&P tailwinds, analysts eye 50%+ gains in 2025. Regulation risks exist, but recent approvals pave the way forward.

MicroStrategy isn't just software—it's a bitcoin powerhouse. CEO Michael Saylor has loaded up over 250,000 BTC. The stock moves like supercharged bitcoin.

Volume spotlight: Spikes to 20+ million shares on hot days.

Why surge now? They use debt wisely to buy more BTC. If bitcoin hits $100K, MSTR could double fast. It trades at a premium to its holdings, but long-term holders win big. S&P strength boosts risk-on plays like this.

MARA is all about bitcoin mining. They deploy massive rigs and chase top hashrate. Cheap Texas energy keeps costs low and profits high.

Volume spotlight: 40-50 million shares daily—insanely liquid.

Why surge now? Efficient post-halving ops give them an edge. Rapid expansion plans. Bitcoin rallies lift miners hard. Owns its own sites, cutting hosting risks. Expect volatility, but rewards match.

RIOT builds huge facilities for bitcoin mining. Texas location slashes energy bills. Hashrate doubled in 2024.

Volume spotlight: 30+ million shares average.

Why surge now? Targets 100 EH/s by mid-2025. Direct bitcoin price link. S&P inflows favor miners. Bonus: Plans to pivot into AI computing for extra revenue streams.

CleanSpark mines with renewables like solar and hydro. ESG fans flock here. Stock rocketed 300% in 2024.

Volume spotlight: 15-20 million shares daily.

Why surge now? Snaps up cheap distressed miners. Momentum rolls into 2025. Carbon credits could add new income. S&P positivity amplifies the upside.

IREN runs efficient miners in Canada using hydro power. Zero debt, plenty of cash for growth.

Volume spotlight: Around 10 million shares, trending up.

Why surge now? Stock doubled lately. Aims for 20 EH/s. Clean balance sheet shines in tough times. Blockchain bull market fuels it higher.

Bitfarms spans Canada, U.S., and South America. Smart site choices avoid energy spikes. Fresh leadership focuses on efficiency.

Volume spotlight: 8-12 million shares daily.

Why surge now? Push to 21 EH/s soon. Bitcoin surges benefit all miners, but flexible ops give Bitfarms an edge. High volume signals building interest.

These stocks pack punch, but swings are real. Bitcoin dips crush miners. Regs could tighten. Still, high volume reduces some liquidity risks. Monitor daily volume—rising trades mean momentum builds.

The <7 High-Volume Blockchain Stocks> are primed as the S&P 500 sets a bullish tone. From Coinbase's exchange dominance to miners like MARA and RIOT chasing bitcoin glory, these picks blend liquidity, growth, and crypto exposure. Track bitcoin prices, ETF flows, and volume spikes. Do your homework, pick your favorites, and ride the 2025 surge.

Canton Network has positioned itself as the primary blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance institutions. 

The platform processes over $280 billion daily through major financial players. Wall Street's adoption of blockchain technology appears to be materializing through private, institutional-grade networks rather than public alternatives.

Broadridge Financial Solutions operates as a critical backbone for global financial markets. The $26 billion company handles approximately $10 trillion in daily transactions. 

The firm deployed its Distributed Ledger Repo platform on Canton Network in 2023. This platform now processes over $280 billion in daily repo market volumes.

The DLR platform enables instantaneous settlement of financial collateral between banking institutions. Banks can track lending activities, bond ownership, and cash settlements in real time. Traditional settlement processes often require multiple days to complete transactions. Canton's infrastructure reduces this timeline to seconds through atomic capabilities.

Broadridge serves 19 of the 24 major players in the repo market. The company continues migrating legacy operations to the blockchain-based system. 

Industry observers note that tokenized assets represent legally binding economic claims. These digital representations mirror traditional financial instruments in economic value.

Canton's architecture employs DAML programming language for enhanced privacy features. Bank A and Bank B can transact while keeping operations invisible to others. 

This privacy-focused design addresses regulatory requirements and competitive concerns. Public blockchains cannot offer the confidentiality that traditional finance demands.

The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation received SEC approval to tokenize US Treasuries. DTCC manages over $100 trillion in assets under custody. Approximately $30 trillion of these assets consist of US Treasury securities. This regulatory clearance enables tokenization of Depository Trust Company assets.

Goldman Sachs built its bond tokenization platform GS DAP on Canton Network. Nasdaq integrated its Calypso platform with Canton for collateral management. 

The Calypso system serves over 95 percent of major banking institutions. Banks now manage tokenized collateral within existing risk management software.

Additional participants include Bank of America, Santander, Tradeweb, DRW, and Citadel. These institutions utilize Canton for real-time collateral operations and 24/7 market access. 

The network facilitates settlement of tokenized treasuries against stablecoin instruments. Traditional settlement systems cannot match this operational efficiency and speed.

Digital Asset Holdings raised over $450 million to develop Canton Network. Strategic investors include Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, and Citadel. 

Circle and other blockchain firms also participated in funding rounds. These investors actively use the network rather than functioning as passive providers.

Canton succeeded where previous attempts failed by offering neutral infrastructure. Competing institutions avoided proprietary systems controlled by rivals. 

The platform coordinates major players through shared private blockchain infrastructure. Analysts suggest 2026 could mark institutional blockchain adoption reaching critical mass.

In December 2021, a digital record linked to a computer-generated picture of a robot samurai sold at auction for an amount of cryptocurrency then worth over $1.8 million.

These were the heady final months of the worldwide craze for ""non-fungible tokens"" — or NFTs to you and me. NFTs, on its most basic level, is the ownership of a digital piece of work, such as art or music. They could include memes or even actual pieces of art. Advocates promised that they would revolutionize art patronage while making millions of ordinary people filthy rich in a matter of months.

Sotheby's and Christies sold NFTs for millions of dollars apiece. Jimmy Fallon hyped ‘Bored Apes' on The Tonight Show. Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton, Louis Vuitton, YouTube, and the University of California-Berkeley all got stuck in. Exactly what NFTs were, or how they worked, was often lost in the mania.

Yet within a year, the NFT market had dramatically collapsed, taking many people's money and hopes with it. Estimated trading volumes dropped from $4 billion to around $800 million, and research suggests that 95 percent of NFTs are now worthless.

Today, the highest price anyone has offered for that $1.8 million robot samurai NFT in the past 12 months is just 0.0554 Ether, equivalent to $2,852 as of December 17.

Even after all that, however, some advocates insist that the underlying technology still has important uses, and dream that it may yet rise from the ashes.

So what the hell happened to NFTs? And could they ever make a comeback?

On March 11, 2021, the venerable British auction house Christies announced that it had sold its first ever NFT for a staggering $69 million.

The associated artwork was titled Everydays: the First 5000 Days, by the online artist known as Beeple (aka Michael Winkelmann). In theory, he was now one of the three most valuable living artists on Earth.

You'll notice, though, that I didn't say anything about Beeple actually selling an artwork. That's because he didn't. And this distinction is key to understanding why NFTs went so wrong.

For centuries, the art world has struggled to maintain reliable records of ownership in the face of war, disaster and forgery. And in May 2014, two men at a New York City hackathon — artist Kevin McCoy and tech entrepreneur Anil Dash — attempted to make their own modest contribution by harnessing a nascent digital technology called blockchains.

A blockchain is basically a way to create and maintain permanent transaction logs without relying on centralized institutions. Each new entry is verified by a network of computers that check each other's work, wielding unbreakable encryption to resist tampering.

That's how cryptocurrencies, such as Ether and Bitcoin, can operate without any input from banks or governments. It's also how NFTs were meant to help verify art ownership.

""The idea behind NFTs was, and is, profound,"" wrote Anil Dash in 2021. ""Technology should be enabling artists to exercise control over their work, to more easily sell it, to more strongly protect against others appropriating it without permission.

The idea was to create a unique digital certificate of art ownership that could always be traced back all the way to its original creator. Selling these certificates could give digital artists a new way to fund their art, and collectors a new way to buy in.

Others quickly expanded the idea, coining the term ""non-fungible token"" in 2017 to distinguish these certificates from, say, a Bitcoin (which is interchangeable with any other Bitcoin).

But the new NFT industry — which Dash was not part of, and has repeatedly denounced — never solved some basic problems with the concept. 

Who owns the Mona Lisa? Back in 2018, the blockchain start-up Verisart briefly listed the answer as a British coder named Terence Eden.

Eden's stunt was simple and easy to fix. Still, it raised the question: how do you know that the original seller of an NFT was actually representing the real artist? Wouldn't you need some kind of trusted institution to make and maintain that link?

As Eden pointed out at the time: “There's no way to permanently attach a digital certificate to a physical work of art... it's almost as if we can't just throw technology at the social problem of trust.”

Another question: Does buying an NFT actually come with any rights over the artwork itself? If not, what is the buyer even getting? Also, who's going to police fraud and impersonation? Who will protect consumers from account hacks, given that blockchain transactions (unlike bank transfers) are irreversible?

As money and enthusiasm began to pour into NFTs in the wake of Covid-19, major marketplaces largely just shrugged and fell back on ""buyer beware."" Artist verification remained weak; many NFTs conferred no rights; and all too many NFT advocates chose relentless hype over caution.

Digital trading cards! Merchandise and collectibles! Rapidly rising art prices! You too could ride this rocket to the moon if only you get in right now!

The result was an unprecedented wave of scams, fraud and outright cyber-theft, affecting both artists and buyers. Many NFTs never even contained a copy of the artwork they were meant to be tied to. They just had hyperlinks, which often went dead within a year or two.

All too often, the art itself was also dire, replicating the modern “AI slop” aesthetic years or months before the release of ChatGPT.

""Nothing went the way it was supposed to,"" wrote Dash in 2021, likening the whole affair to an exploitative ""gold rush.""

Meanwhile, famed (and famously expensive) British conceptual artist Damien Hirst created NFTs for thousands of his paintings, then burned the originals. “I'm not burning my art,” he declared. “I'm transforming it into NFTs.”

In 2022, as predicted by so many critics, the NFT market began to crash. 

In April, an NFT of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's first ever tweet — which had fetched $2.9 million the previous March — went on sale again, but the highest bid was $280. By July, daily NFT sales had plummeted by more than 90 percent. 

Among the biggest losers were celebrities who had bought in late in the hype cycle. Justin Bieber's 'Bored Ape' NFT cost around $1.3 millions in Ether; Eminem's version cost just under $460,000. As of Dec. 17, 2025, the highest recent offer for either is around $2,800.

Then there's Logan Paul, who promised that his forthcoming NFT-based video game CryptoZoo would let you earn money just by playing it. That never happened, leading to a class action lawsuit and Paul offering to partially refund customers.

Most victims were less famous. ""I still hold the vast majority of [my NFTs] – I couldn't sell most even if I wanted to,"" collector Joseph Skewes told Vice News in 2023. ""From the peak, the loss is upwards of $50,000."" 

Another collector in Florida, who asked to be anonymous, said he'd come out of the first crash unscathed but then managed to lose up to $400,000 trying to recapture the magic afterwards.

Some of the biggest NFT ""whales"" — often crypto entrepreneurs — seem to be doing fine, as are those that merely rode the dragon while it was in flight.

""We were very much about getting in and getting out within 24 hours,"" prolific NFT trader Collin Li told The Australian Financial Review in July. 

In September, Christies admitted defeat and closed its digital art department. Bitcoin prices have rebounded since the crash of '22, and Ether prices partially rebounded; NFTs never did.

As for Anil Dash, he never took a financial stake in NFTs, but the mess still follows him. “My son mockingly calls me ‘NFT guy' because he knows it's the most horrible epithet I could ever be saddled with,” he said on Bluesky in 2023:

Even so, there are people who still carry a torch. Jane Rolls and G.T. Sewell of Melbourne, Australia, told the Review that they remain about $250,000 down, but continue to make and buy NFTs because they believe the long-term future is bright.

According to Fast Company, while many NFT companies perished, other firms continue to find ways to integrate NFTs, including Louis Vuitton and various video game developers. Disney's official tie-in NFTs sell at respectable prices, as do the NBA's.

Notably, many of the ongoing projects rely on the heft of a big institution to guarantee authenticity. That suggests NFTs can have their uses, as long as someone is actually policing them — although it's a fair cry from the futuristic vision of “decentralized” digital items free from corporate control that some NFT boosters promised.

""I think everything's working out the right way,” longtime NFT magnate Roham Gharegozlou told Fast Company. ""There were speculative excesses within the industry, but I think that also was a stress test for everything to come.""

NFT supply has hit 1.34B as sales plunge. Digital art fades, while gaming NFTs thrive through real utility and play-to-own adoption.

The NFT space is currently facing a harsh reality check. A new year has begun, and the total number of NFTs minted across all blockchains has surged to a staggering 1.34 billion. 

However, investors are jumping ship and sales revenue has been down. Is this the end of the NFT space?

This decline in NFT sales revenue is a 25% increase from the previous year. 

It also shows that creators are still pumping out content at an incredible pace despite the lack of demand from buyers. 

While the supply is at an all-time high, the actual sales revenue for the past year dropped to just $5.63 billion. This is a heavy decline from the $8.9 billion recorded in 2024. 

LATEST: ⚡️ The NFT market expanded to over 1.34 billion tokens in 2025 while total sales fell 37% to $5.6 billion, with average prices dropping to $96 from $124 year-over-year, according to CryptoSlam. pic.twitter.com/RLUuzrsJQG

— CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) January 1, 2026



Even worse, the average price of an NFT has also tumbled from $124 to roughly $96.

This data now shows the NFT market as one that is “oversupplied and under-demanded”, and gone are the days when Bored Ape NFTs sold for millions of dollars.

Yet while all of this is happening, the lights are still on, and the volume is actually growing. 

One of the biggest reasons for the “no buyers”problem is the collapse of the Profile Picture (PFP) and digital art segments. 

In 2021 and 2022, projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks dominated the headlines. Today, the floor prices for many of these “blue chip” collections have dropped by as much as 75%. 

Investors who once bought these assets for their rarity are now finding it nearly impossible to find a secondary buyer.

The market has so far moved away from the “culture coin” era. 

People are no longer willing to pay high premiums for static images that offer no functional use, and according to data from CryptoSlam, the number of unique purchasers per month has remained low for most of the past year. 

This is a clear sign that the “hype” buyers have left the building, and are leaving behind a mountain of 1.34 billion unsold tokens.

While digital art is gathering dust, NFTs in the gaming space are moving faster than ever. 

The global NFT gaming market was valued at roughly $6.1 billion last year. This happened because, unlike a piece of digital art, a gaming NFT has a specific job, whether it be a sword, a skin or a piece of virtual land.

GM Gamers

I accumulate $GUNZ by selling Items. The market isn't very active, but sales… pic.twitter.com/zBriqEedSx

— Coinisan (@Coinisan) January 3, 2026



This “utility” (or use case) is what keeps the market alive. Gamers are not buying these items to “flip” them to the next person, even though that is still possible. 

They are buying them to use, and this creates a cycle of demand that does not rely on purely speculative hype. 

Major platforms like OpenSea and Magic Eden have also recognised this trend and are moving away from being “art galleries” to “gaming hubs”.

The focus used to be on Play to Earn games in the early days of Blockchain gaming.

Games like Axie Infinity allowed players to make a living, but these models collapsed when token prices fell. This year, the industry has so far moved toward “Play-to-Own” (P2O). 

In this model, the focus is on fun first, and the NFTs are a reward for engagement, rather than a financial obligation.

This simple change has brought back the players and companies like Mythical Inc. and Splinterlands have built massive communities of tech-savvy gamers who value digital ownership. 

In North America, roughly 30% of NFT gamers now view blockchain titles as their main form of entertainment. 

They are not looking for a quick profit, and are looking for a deeper connection to the games they love.","{'href': 'https://www.livebitcoinnews.com', 'title': 'Live Bitcoin News'}","cryptocurrency"

RLUSD exemplifies what the next generation of stablecoins should be: fully aligned with regulatory standards while delivering the speed, efficiency, and versatility that the crypto ecosystem demands. 

Backed by oversight from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and operating under conditional approval from the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), RLUSD meets rigorous compliance criteria that few stablecoins can claim. 

Therefore, this dual-layer regulatory alignment provides institutional and retail participants with unprecedented confidence, ensuring that RLUSD is not only reliable but also legally robust.

Well, Ripple is redefining the stablecoin market. While many digital assets navigate regulatory gray areas, RLUSD proves that innovation can coexist with bank-grade security and compliance, offering a blueprint for stablecoins to seamlessly bridge traditional finance and the evolving blockchain ecosystem.

As a result, RLUSD is now going multichain with Wormhole NTT, enabling seamless interoperability across blockchains while maintaining full regulatory compliance. This expansion unlocks a stable, liquid, and secure digital currency for businesses and investors, supporting cross-border payments, DeFi, and next-generation Web3 applications at scale.

As digital assets evolve, regulated, resilient, and interoperable stablecoins are essential. RLUSD positions Ripple at the forefront of this transformation. With NYDFS oversight, conditional federal approval, and multichain functionality, RLUSD delivers unmatched compliance while enabling seamless value transfer across the digital economy.

RLUSD embodies the next generation of stablecoins: secure, compliant, and universally connected. Ripple's vision proves that regulatory rigor and technological innovation can advance together.

RLUSD isn't just a stablecoin, it's the blueprint for the future of digital finance. Backed by national bank-grade oversight, conditional federal approval, and multichain interoperability, it delivers a secure, compliant, and versatile asset for the next era of global finance. 

By uniting regulatory rigor with blockchain innovation, RLUSD sets a new standard for trust, transparency, and seamless cross-chain value transfer, empowering a truly connected digital economy.

Bit Digital Inc.'s stocks have been trading up by 7.42% driven by significant positive market sentiment and exciting growth prospects.



Live Update At 14:04:29 EST: On Friday, January 02, 2026 Bit Digital Inc. stock [NASDAQ: BTBT] is trending up by 7.42%! Discover the key drivers behind this movement as well as our expert analysis in the detailed breakdown below.

When evaluating trading opportunities, it's important to approach them with a checklist mindset. As Tim Bohen, lead trainer with StocksToTrade says, “A good trade setup checks all the boxes—volume, trend, catalyst. Don't trade if you're missing pieces of the puzzle.” This emphasizes the need for thorough research and strategy. By ensuring all criteria are met, traders can better position themselves for successful outcomes. It's crucial to avoid rushing into trades without a comprehensive plan that includes analyzing market trends, examining current trading volumes, and identifying any catalysts that might influence stock movements.

Bit Digital experienced notable market activities recently. Let's delve into their earnings, key ratios, and financial trends. In their latest earnings report, Bit Digital shows profitability growth with a pre-tax profit margin of 34%. This suggests a well-performing strategy that may sustain shareholder value. 

On financial strength, they display a leverage ratio of 1.3, showing modest borrowing compared to their equity – a good point for potential investors.

From the balance sheet, with total assets over $1.13B, the company appears structurally sound. Still, fluctuating stock prices reflect market responses to industry trends and crypto's volatility. They remain reliant on their Ethereum and AI investments, facing the challenge of navigating these fast-evolving sectors.

The news highlights Bit Digital's accumulated Ethereum holdings and their strategy, possibly boding well for stock valuation in crypto-favoring moments. Yet, the fast-paced crypto world requires cautious navigation. Keeping the company agile in AI and crypto could be key to ensuring they continually adapt and excel.

A glance at recent strategic changes reveals intentional moves aimed at strengthening governance and securing competitive edge in Ethereum markets. Amanda Cassatt's board appointment exemplifies this direction. Her expertise in blockchain and digital assets introduces fresh perspectives and might boost investor confidence.

Furthermore, Bit Digital's Ethereum treasury strategies, which include staking rewards and increased holdings, reflect a calculated focus on crypto. This aligns with broader market trends and Bitcoin's steady rise. While market volatility could challenge Bit Digital, their strategic choices may mitigate impacts, supporting resilience against unfavorable market conditions and potential price shocks.

Their involvement in Ethereum underscores adaptability to market signals and appetite for digital currency advancement – attributes central to staying relevant.

Examining Bit Digital's potential, it's crucial to highlight both opportunities and challenges. With digital currency gaining mainstream acceptance, their Ethereum investments could see significant future value. However, market whims demand caution. Crypto projects often face rapid shifts, regulatory scrutiny, and competitive landscape changes.

While Bit Digital's calculated moves in crypto promise potential returns, unexpected downturns in these markets may necessitate swift strategic adjustments. On the earnings front, despite good quarterly figures, stock price fluctuations emphasize market unease.

Investors must balance optimism with realism. While the buzz around their industry's growth is undeniable, Bit Digital's success depends on the precise execution of its strategies to harness market transitions skillfully.

Amanda Cassatt Joins Board: Bringing rich blockchain and marketing chops, Cassatt's induction onto Bit Digital's board is meaningful. Her strategic vision may steer Bit Digital's operations in new and promising directions, especially focusing on Ethereum and AI.

Ethereum Fortification: Bit Digital's significant Ethereum holdings, new acquisitions, and staking plans hint at a bullish stance towards digital currency. This underlines a thoughtful strategy adapting to global financial evolutions where virtual currencies play major roles.

Treasury and Staking Gains: An early December report revealed impressive Ethereum treasuries, spotlighting Bit Digital's strategic bet on crypto's future. This aligns with broader blockchain trends, emphasizing financial system evolution where blockchain elements are increasingly prominent.



Bit Digital is clearly a company in motion. Navigating the volatile seas of crypto and AI requires not just vision, but agility and a firm grasp of market dynamics. Standing at this precipice, where both concern and potential coalesce, Bit Digital must leverage its key assets – strategic leadership, effective governance, and a nimble approach amidst market shifts. 

With their substantial and growing Ethereum presence, and potential market demand shifts in favor of digital currencies, they are positioned well. Still, it's a position fraught with risks that experienced oversight will need to manage diligently. As Tim Bohen, lead trainer with StocksToTrade says, “I focus on momentum that's visible right now. Speculation on future moves is outside my playbook.” This perspective aligns well with Bit Digital's need for a responsive strategy that capitalizes on current trends. It's a balancing act – one vital to their trajectory.

""There is essentially no legitimate use for crypto.""

Photo Credit: TikTok 


Viewers of a TikTok clip about cryptocurrency are locked in a heated debate after a famous economist claimed no one is using crypto for anything legitimate. Aside from contentions on the legality and practicality of use, some viewers have also raised concerns about its environmental impact.

In the video, TikTok creator Hasan Minhaj (@hasanminhaj) shared a segment of his interview with Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman — who offered a blunt assessment of digital currencies: ""There is essentially no legitimate use for crypto, and nobody is using it for anything legitimate.""

Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman thinks crypto is a cult 

In Krugman's opinion, crypto is either a speculative asset or a vehicle for crime. He further supposes that angry rebuttals to his statement would likely be because the crypto community is a cult.

Crypto users were quick to dispute Krugman's claims. They argued that crypto has legitimate uses in countries with unstable banking systems and is useful for global transfers. They've also countered that fiat currency is used more for crime than crypto.

Still, more people are wary of crypto, even comparing it to MLM or Ponzi schemes. And, beyond the issue of real-world usefulness, its environmental impact is harder to ignore. 

An analysis by the International Energy Agency showed that crypto mining, along with data centers and AI, used almost 2% of the world's electricity in 2022. As the demand for these technologies increases, the IEA forecasts this energy consumption to double by 2026 — requiring enough extra electricity to power an entire country.

Kelvin is the Apple of space heaters, designed for energy efficiency and maximum comfort. It's completely silent and intelligently controlled, with setup taking just 5 minutes.

Built from premium materials like aluminum and glass, Kelvin works beautifully as a full-home heating system or as the perfect solution for that one room that never feels warm enough.

On the flip side, new technologies and more sustainable energy sources are helping minimize the crypto impact. Newer proof-of-stake blockchains, for instance, can be powered by clean electricity, use far less energy, and produce less air pollution, as shown in the CCRI Crypto Sustainability Metrics.

As crypto technology evolves, there may still be a path toward a future where it serves clear and practical purposes without putting such a heavy strain on the grid. For now, there are still alternatives for investors to consider, like clean economy stocks and cleaner banks. 

The posted video is less about settling the crypto question and more about revealing just how divided people are over what this technology is really for and what it's costing the planet. 

""And it's bad for the environment,"" one viewer commented.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Pi Network Price, Ethereum Price USD, Next Big Crypto","https://blockchainreporter.net/vitaliks-zk-technology-support-puts-zero-knowledge-proof-zkp-ahead-while-ethereum-and-pi-network-price-play-catch-up/","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:07:11 GMT","

Right now, traders are on the hunt for the next big crypto, especially as many big names turn increasingly bearish. The Pi Network price is navigating volatility as the ecosystem undergoes the Testnet2 to Protocol v23 upgrade, a transition that required a temporary suspension of wallet services. At the same time, the Ethereum price in USD continues to reflect heavy spot accumulation, with leverage also increasing.

Then there is the new project, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP), which stands out for a different reason. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin's recent call to use zero-knowledge proofs in content ranking systems has drawn more attention toward how these tools are applied in practice.

In that context, ZKP is already operating a live, on-chain presale auction that resets every 24 hours. With real activity underway and a structure aligned with current protocol discussions, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is making its mark as the potential next big crypto.

Recent updates linked to the Pi Network price relate mainly to network maintenance rather than trading activity. Pi Network is upgrading Testnet2 to Protocol v23, which requires temporary wallet maintenance and brief service pauses across parts of the ecosystem. 

The upgrade includes integration with Stellar Core v23 and is part of ongoing work to support smart contracts and system operations.

The Pi core team had stated that such pauses can occur during protocol upgrades. Wallet access and some exchange-related services were affected, with platforms such as OKX pausing certain Pi operations during this period.

Separate updates have also mentioned limited testing of new wallet features in some regions. At this stage, the Pi Network price reflects a development period centered on technical updates rather than market movement.

The Ethereum price USD reflects mixed positioning from both longer-term holders and shorter-term traders. On-chain data shows Bitmine, linked to Tom Lee, accumulating more than 48,000 ETH, valued at over $140 million, which points to gradual spot accumulation rather than distribution. 

At the same time, leverage participation has increased, including a 25x leveraged position opened using $1.2 million USDC on HyperLiquid after a prior liquidation.

Futures data shows continued market-order buying, while funding rates have moved higher, indicating a concentration of long positions. Liquidation data also highlights clusters of leveraged exposure below recent trading ranges.

This pattern suggests active positioning but limited confirmation from longer-term network demand data signals. Overall, the Ethereum price USD reflects higher sensitivity to leverage and positioning conditions rather than changes in underlying network use.

Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is gaining attention as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin continues to highlight the role of zero-knowledge proofs in public systems, placing it early in discussions around the next big crypto. 

In a recent post, Buterin argued that social platforms should use ZK proofs and blockchain records to ensure content ranking follows clear rules without exposing private data. He also pointed to on-chain time stamping and delayed code disclosure as ways to limit censorship and manipulation.

Now, the Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) project applies zero-knowledge methods within an active network, where participation and verification already take place on the chain. This includes a live presale auction and a working hardware system. The first Proof Pod has already been delivered, showing that parts of the network are operating beyond theory.

The presale auction releases 200 million ZKP coins every 24 hours, with allocations based on proportional participation rather than fixed pricing. Results are recorded on-chain, daily wallet limits reduce concentrated influence, and no private rounds are involved. The closing value from each presale auction also feeds directly into network operations, as it becomes the foundation for the Proof Pod rewards the following day.

With these elements already running and closely aligned with how privacy and fairness are now being discussed at the protocol level, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) continues to strengthen its position as the next big crypto for buyers tracking systems that are active today.

Each project in this comparison reflects a different phase. The Pi Network price is shaped by protocol upgrades and temporary wallet maintenance, keeping focus on infrastructure rather than market activity. Ethereum remains heavily traded, but the Ethereum price USD reflects higher sensitivity to leverage and positioning, which increases risk during active trading periods.

Meanwhile, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) enters the next big crypto discussion from a position of execution. As privacy and fairness move higher in industry focus, reinforced by Vitalik Buterin's emphasis on zero-knowledge proofs, investor attention is shifting toward ZKP, which is already live. ZKP is running a public on-chain presale auction supported by active infrastructure and real participation. With daily presale auction cycles resetting and network activity already in place, ZKP stands out as the next big crypto for buyers focused on timing, structure, and visible progress.

1. What is Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)?

Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a blockchain network that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify actions without revealing private data. It focuses on fairness, privacy, and verifiable activity on-chain.

2. Why is Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) linked to Vitalik Buterin's comments?

Vitalik Buterin recently highlighted how zero-knowledge proofs can improve fairness and transparency in public systems. ZKP is already applying these ideas within a live network.

3. How does the Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) presale auction work?

ZKP uses a daily on-chain presale auction where 200 million tokens are distributed every 24 hours. Tokens are allocated based on proportional participation, not fixed pricing.

4. What makes Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) different from other projects?

ZKP already has live systems in place, including an active auction and delivered Proof Pods. This shows practical operation rather than future plans.

5. Why is Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) considered the next big crypto?

Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is often discussed as the next big crypto because it combines active infrastructure, daily price discovery, and real use of zero-knowledge proofs, while many networks are still transitioning.

The U.S. carried out a ""large scale"" strike against Venezuela and its President Nicolas Maduro, Donald Trump announced early Saturday morning. Maduro and his wife, Trump continued, were captured and flown out of the country.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi later announced that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had each been indicted in the Southern District of New York over various drug trafficking and weapons charges.

Crypto prices took a modest hit around 2 a.m. ET on reports of military operations in Venezuela, with bitcoin BTC$89,493.41 dipping about 0.5% to $89,300. At press time, just shy of 9 a.m. ET, BTC had returned to just below $90,000.

President Trump has scheduled a news conference for 11 a.m. ET.

XRP surged to $2.02 after buyers forced a clean break through $1.96 on strong volume, flipping a key ceiling into support and putting the focus on whether the token can hold above $2.00 long enough to trigger a second leg higher.

The move lands as traders re-engage with large-cap alts after a choppy stretch that repeatedly rejected XRP above the $2.00 handle. For XRP specifically, the $1.96 level has acted as a recurring decision point in recent sessions — rallies that cleared it briefly often struggled to hold, while failures at the level attracted fast selling.

That makes the quality of the breakout the story this time: rather than a thin, stop-driven pop, the rally came with sustained volume, suggesting larger participants were active. With positioning still sensitive into early January, XRP's ability to stay above $2.00 could influence whether sidelined traders step back in or treat the move as another sell-the-rip opportunity.

XRP jumped 8.7% from $1.8766 to $2.0227 over the 24-hour session ending Jan. 3, with the breakout gaining traction at 17:00 UTC, when volume surged to 154.4M — about 142% above the session average — and price pushed decisively through $1.96.

That level is the inflection point. Clearing $1.96 turned the prior ceiling into a potential floor, and XRP followed through into the $2.00–$2.03 band rather than immediately snapping back below it. Price then established a new support pocket near $2.01–$2.03, which traders will treat as the “must-hold” zone if this breakout is going to stick.

Late-session action showed the first real test: XRP pulled back from a $2.031 high to about $2.023, drawing 1.59M in volume during the dip. Importantly, that pullback stayed controlled — a ~0.4% retracement — and didn't turn into a cascade back through $2.00. That's the profile traders want to see after a breakout: digestion, not immediate rejection.

This move is now about holding the flip, not chasing the breakout.

The levels are clean:

Bottom line: $2.00 is the headline level, but $1.96 is the real line in the sand. If bulls defend both, the tape can build a continuation move. If not, this slides back into the same range the market just escaped.

XRP rose above $2 on Friday for the first time since mid-December, extending a strong start to 2026 as traders pointed to steady spot ETF inflows and improving U.S. regulatory sentiment.

Data cited by SoSoValue showed U.S. spot XRP ETFs took in $13.59 million on Jan. 2, pushing total inflows since launch to $1.18 billion. The steady demand has helped tilt near-term supply and demand dynamics in XRP's favor, even as broader crypto benchmarks remain rangebound.

The move also comes as traders reassess the regulatory backdrop after SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw's departure, which some market participants viewed as clearing the way for a more crypto-friendly policy stance. 

Crenshaw had been among the most vocal skeptics of crypto spot ETFs and had opposed the SEC dropping its appeal in the Ripple case, according to market commentary.

Speculation around upcoming legislation added to the momentum. Traders pointed to a possible Market Structure Bill markup on Jan. 15, which has kept policy expectations elevated into the first quarter and contributed to the token's outperformance.

XRP's strength stood out against mixed flows in other major crypto ETFs. 

The same data set cited by analysts showed weaker demand for bitcoin funds over the period, reinforcing the view that XRP's rally is being driven more by token-specific catalysts than a broad risk-on move.

XRP was last trading just over $2, up around 8%, while bitcoin hovered just over $90,000 and ether traded around $3,000, both only modestly higher on the day.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Archaeologists Found a Smoking Gun Behind the End of the Maya Kingdom's Reign","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a69907801/maya-kingdom-collapse-burning-event-discovered/","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 14:41:00 GMT","

How burned artifacts offer a window into the dismantling of a dynasty.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Archaeologists discovered clues to a fire in Guatemala from between 733 and 881 AD that they say represents a key turning point in Maya rule—a very public turning point. 

The discovery at the Maya site of Ucanal in Guatemala “marked a public dismantling of an old regime”—a rather pivotal moment in the collapse of rulers and key point in political power that isn't often shown so clearly from an archeological find, the authors write in a study published in the journal Antiquity.

The event in question occurred at the capital of the K'anwitznal kingdom near a burial site. The bodies and their ornaments—items include a jewel-adorned stone mask, fragments of a greenstone diadem, and jade ornaments—were moved from a tomb to a public burning site, where fire engulfed some of the centuries-old items for all to see. 

“This event marked a moment of change in the kingdom and in the lowlands,” the authors write. “Rather than examine this fire-burning event as a bookend to Maya history, we view it as a pivot point around which the K'anwitznal polity reinvented itself and the city of Ucanal went on to a flourishing of activities.” 

The new leadership regime welcomed a non-royal leader called Papmalil, and there is little in the written record indicating how he came to power. “Papmalil's rule was not only seminal because of his possible foreign origins—perhaps breaking the succession of ruling dynasts at the site—but also because his rule shifted political dynamics in the southern Maya lowlands.” 

The study's authors, led by Christina Halperin at the University of Montreal, state that Papmalil appears to have ushered in an era of prosperity. Substantial construction occurred in both the civic-ceremonial core and outer residential zones of the city following the power shift. 

That new era may have had a dramatic beginning.

The team discovered the fire event during 2022 excavations in the construction fill of a temple-pyramid situated in a public plaza, and the evidence shows that there was no effort to protect the burial deposit. The team believes that at least four adults were part of the burn remains, and that the fire reached a temperature of over 800°C. Included with the bodies were 1,470 fragments of greenstone pendants, beads, plaques, and mosaics, along with large blades—all representing a “single burning event.” The quantity and quality of the burnt and broken ornaments indicate they came from a royal tomb, likely belonging to multiple individuals. 

The team said evidence indicates that the human bone and ornaments had once been part of the contents of a Late Classic royal tomb, and the deposit was part of a fire-entering rite that “marked the symbolic and literal destruction of an earlier K'anwitznal dynastic line.” 

The authors state that the event “appears to have bene an act of desecration: it was dumped at the edge of a crude wall used as a construction pen and no effort was made to protect the fragmented bones and ornaments from the tomb blocks deposited on top of them as construction fill.” It all likely made for a “dramatic public affair” meant to be charged with emotion. “It could dramatically mark,” they wrote, “the dismantling of an ancient regime.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A hidden brain problem may be an early warning for Alzheimer's","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251228020016.htm","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 06:14:55 GMT","

Scientists from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) have found that the brain's waste removal system often becomes blocked in people who show early signs of Alzheimer's disease. These blockages interfere with the brain's ability to clear harmful substances and may appear well before clear dementia symptoms develop.

The clogged pathways are known as ""enlarged perivascular spaces,"" and the findings suggest they could serve as an early warning signal for Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia.

""Since these brain anomalies can be visually identified on routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans performed to evaluate cognitive decline, identifying them could complement existing methods to detect Alzheimer's earlier, without having to do and pay for additional tests,"" said Associate Professor Nagaendran Kandiah from NTU's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), who led the study.

Justin Ong, a fifth-year LKCMedicine student and the study's first author, emphasized the importance of early detection. He noted that identifying Alzheimer's sooner gives doctors more time to intervene and potentially slow the progression of symptoms such as memory loss, reduced thinking speed, and mood changes. The research was conducted as part of LKCMedicine's Scholarly Project module in the School's Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery programme.

Why Studying Asian Populations Matters

The study stands out because it focuses on Asian populations, an area that has been underrepresented in Alzheimer's research. Most existing studies have concentrated on Caucasian participants, which may limit how broadly their findings apply.

The NTU team examined nearly 1,000 people in Singapore from different ethnic backgrounds that reflect the country's population. Participants included individuals with normal cognitive function as well as those experiencing mild thinking difficulties.

Research has shown that dementia does not affect all ethnic groups in the same way, making region specific studies essential.

""For example, among Caucasians with dementia, past studies show that the prevalence of a major risk gene, apolipoprotein E4, linked to Alzheimer's is around 50 to 60 percent. But among Singapore dementia patients, it is less than 20 percent,"" said Assoc Prof Kandiah, who is also Director of the Dementia Research Centre (Singapore) in LKCMedicine. Because of these differences, findings in one population may not directly apply to another.

How the Brain Clears Toxic Waste

Inside the brain, blood vessels are surrounded by small channels called perivascular spaces. These spaces help drain toxic waste products, including beta amyloid and tau proteins, which are found in high levels in people with Alzheimer's disease.

When the brain's waste removal system becomes less efficient, these spaces can enlarge and become visible on MRI scans. Until now, it was unclear whether this change was directly linked to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.

To answer this question, the NTU researchers compared enlarged perivascular spaces with multiple established indicators of Alzheimer's. They also examined how these clogged drainage pathways relate to well known disease markers such as beta amyloid buildup and damage to the brain's white matter, the network of nerve fibers that connects different brain regions.

Comparing Healthy Brains and Early Cognitive Decline

The study included nearly 350 participants with normal thinking abilities, including memory, reasoning, decision making, and focus. The remaining participants showed signs of early cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment, a condition that often precedes dementia.

Previous research has shown that people with mild cognitive impairment face a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, which is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain.

After analyzing MRI scans, the researchers found that participants with mild cognitive impairment were more likely to have enlarged perivascular spaces than those with no cognitive problems.

Blood Markers Strengthen the Link

In addition to brain scans, the scientists measured seven Alzheimer's related biochemicals in participants' blood, including beta amyloid and tau proteins. Elevated levels of these substances are considered warning signs of Alzheimer's disease.

Enlarged perivascular spaces were linked to four of the seven biochemical measurements. This suggests that people with clogged brain drains are more likely to have increased amyloid plaques, tau tangles, and damage to brain cells, placing them at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's.

The researchers also looked at white matter damage, a widely used indicator of Alzheimer's, and found it was associated with six of the seven blood markers. However, further analysis revealed something unexpected.

Among participants with mild cognitive impairment, the connection between Alzheimer's related biochemicals and enlarged perivascular spaces was stronger than the connection with white matter damage. This finding points to clogged brain drainage as a particularly early signal of Alzheimer's disease.

Implications for Diagnosis and Treatment

These insights may help doctors make more informed decisions about early treatment strategies, potentially slowing disease progression before lasting brain damage occurs.

""The findings carry substantial clinical implications,"" said Assoc Prof Kandiah. ""Although white matter damage is more widely used in clinical practice to evaluate for dementia, as it is easily recognised on MRI scans, our results suggest that enlarged perivascular spaces may hold unique value in detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease.""

Dr. Rachel Cheong Chin Yee, a Senior Consultant and Deputy Head at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital's Department of Geriatric Medicine, said the study highlights the role of small blood vessel changes in Alzheimer's development.

""These findings are significant because they suggest that brain scans showing enlarged perivascular spaces could potentially help identify people at higher risk of Alzheimer's disease, even before symptoms appear,"" said Dr. Cheong, who was not involved in the research.

Rethinking Brain Vessel Disease and Alzheimer's

Dr. Chong Yao Feng, a Consultant at the National University Hospital's Division of Neurology who was also not involved in the study, noted that cerebrovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease have traditionally been viewed as separate conditions.

""The study's findings are intriguing as they demonstrate that both diseases do interact in a synergistic manner,"" said Dr. Chong, who is also a Clinical Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.

As a result, doctors reviewing MRI scans should be cautious about assuming cognitive symptoms are caused only by blood vessel problems when markers such as enlarged perivascular spaces are present. These features may also signal a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease.

""Doctors will then have to use their clinical judgement of the patient's scan and symptoms, as well as discuss with the patient, to determine if more checks are needed to confirm whether a patient has Alzheimer's disease or not,"" said Dr. Chong.

What Comes Next

The NTU research team plans to track participants over time to determine how many eventually develop Alzheimer's dementia. This follow up will help confirm whether enlarged perivascular spaces can reliably predict progression to dementia.

If future studies in other populations reach similar conclusions, identifying clogged brain drains on MRI scans could become a routine tool for detecting Alzheimer's risk much earlier than is currently possible.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists discover why mental disorders so often overlap","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251223084855.htm","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 07:30:03 GMT","

A large international team of scientists is shedding new light on a long-standing puzzle in mental health: why many people are diagnosed with more than one psychiatric disorder over their lifetime. In research published December 10 in the journal Nature, the group presents the most extensive and detailed investigation so far into the shared genetic foundations of 14 psychiatric conditions.

The work was led by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium's Cross-Disorder Working Group. The group is co-chaired by Kenneth Kendler, M.D., a professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Virginia Commonwealth University's School of Medicine, and Jordan Smoller, M.D., a professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

Genetics and the Challenge of Defining Mental Illness

For most people diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, that diagnosis is rarely the only one they will receive. Many go on to develop a second or even third condition, which complicates how mental illnesses are classified and treated. Life experiences and environment clearly shape mental health risk, but genetics also play an important role in determining why disorders so often overlap.

To better understand those genetic influences, researchers analyzed data from more than 6 million people. Their findings reveal that the 14 psychiatric disorders studied are not genetically isolated. Instead, they fall into five broad groups that share substantial genetic similarities. This clearer picture of genetic overlap could eventually help clinicians tailor care more effectively for patients with complex diagnoses.

What Genetics Can Reveal About Psychiatric Disorders

""Psychiatry is the only medical specialty with no definitive laboratory tests. We can't give a blood test to tell whether someone has depression -- we have to rely on symptoms and signs. And that's true for almost every psychiatric disorder,"" said Kendler, a world-renowned researcher for his pioneering studies in psychiatric genetics. ""Genetics is a developing tool that allows us to understand the relationships between disorders. The findings from this study reflect the most comprehensive analysis of psychiatric genomic data to date and shed new light on why individuals with one psychiatric disorder often have a second or third.""

The study examined genetic material from more than 1 million people diagnosed with a childhood- or adult-onset psychiatric disorder, along with data from 5 million individuals without any diagnosed condition. By identifying genetic markers that appear more frequently in people with specific disorders, scientists can better pinpoint the biological factors that contribute to mental illness.

Shared Variants and Genetic Hot Spots

Using several complementary analytical methods, the research team explored the genetic structure of all 14 psychiatric disorders. This approach uncovered 428 genetic variants linked to more than one condition. The analysis also identified 101 areas on chromosomes that acted as ""hot spots"" where these shared genetic variants were especially concentrated.

Statistical modeling allowed the researchers to group the disorders based on genetic similarity. The five groups identified were:

Which Disorders Share the Most Genetic Risk

Some conditions showed especially strong genetic connections. Major depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder shared about 90% of their genetic risk. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder also showed substantial overlap, sharing roughly 66% of their genetic markers.

The researchers also found that disorders with shared genetic risk often followed similar biological patterns. These similarities included when shared genes were active during human development and which types of brain cells were affected. For example, genes active in oligodendrocytes, an important component of the central nervous system, were more closely linked to internalizing disorders. In contrast, genes expressed in excitatory neurons, which stimulate other neurons, were more strongly associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Implications for Diagnosis and Treatment

According to the researchers, these results provide a strong scientific foundation for how psychiatric disorders are defined. The findings may also guide future efforts to develop new treatments or adapt existing therapies for conditions that commonly occur together.

""I feel very proud to be a part of this effort,"" Kendler said. ""This work really shows that we gain more for our field and for those suffering from mental illness when we come together to tackle these scientific challenges.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists tested intermittent fasting without eating less and found no metabolic benefit","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251228020018.htm","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 09:12:25 GMT","

A new study from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke (DIfE) and Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin challenges a widely held belief about intermittent fasting. The research shows that time-restricted eating does not lead to measurable improvements in metabolic or cardiovascular health when calorie intake remains unchanged. However, the timing of meals did affect the body's internal clocks. These findings come from the ChronoFast study led by Prof. Olga Ramich and were published in Science Translational Medicine.

Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a form of intermittent fasting that limits daily food intake to a window of no more than ten hours, followed by a fasting period of at least 14 hours. The approach has become popular as a simple strategy to support weight management and metabolic health. Animal studies show that TRE can protect rodents from diet-related obesity and metabolic problems. In humans, earlier studies have reported benefits such as improved insulin sensitivity, healthier blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and modest reductions in body weight and body fat. As a result, TRE has been widely viewed as a promising tool for preventing insulin resistance and diabetes.

Conflicting Evidence From Earlier Studies

Despite its popularity, past research on TRE has produced mixed results. Many studies have not been able to determine whether observed health improvements came from shorter eating windows, unintentional calorie reduction, or a combination of both. In addition, most earlier trials did not carefully track calorie intake or control for other factors that could influence metabolic outcomes.

To address these gaps, Prof. Olga Ramich, Head of the Department of Molecular Metabolism and Precision Nutrition at the DIfE and Professor at the Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin, designed the ChronoFast trial. The goal was to test whether an eight-hour eating window could improve insulin sensitivity and other metabolic markers when calorie intake was kept constant.

How the ChronoFast Study Was Conducted

The study used a randomized crossover design and included 31 women with overweight or obesity. Each participant followed two different eating schedules for two weeks at a time. One schedule involved early time-restricted eating between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.(eTRE). The other followed a later schedule from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. (lTRE). Throughout both phases, participants ate nearly identical meals with the same calorie and nutrient content (isocaloric).

Researchers collected blood samples during four clinic visits and performed oral glucose tolerance tests to assess glucose and fat metabolism. Continuous glucose monitoring tracked blood sugar levels over 24 hours while food intake was recorded in detail. Physical activity was monitored using a motion sensor. In collaboration with Prof. Achim Kramer from the Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin, the team also examined changes in the body's internal clock using isolated blood cells.

Measuring the Body's Internal Clock

Human biology follows internally generated rhythms that roughly align with the length of a day, which is why they are known as circadian clocks (Latin: circa and dia). These rhythms help regulate nearly every physiological process, including sleep and metabolism. Almost all cells in the body contain their own internal clock, which can be influenced by light, physical activity, and food timing.

To measure individual circadian phases, Prof. Dr. Achim Kramer developed the BodyTime assay. This test requires only a single blood sample and provides an objective snapshot of a person's internal timing. The ChronoFast study used this method and confirmed that eating schedules can shift internal clocks in humans.

No Metabolic Improvements Found

Despite expectations based on earlier research, the ChronoFast study found no clinically meaningful changes in insulin sensitivity, blood sugar, blood fats, or inflammatory markers after the two-week interventions. ""Our results suggest that the health benefits observed in earlier studies were likely due to unintended calorie reduction, rather than the shortened eating period itself,"" explains Ramich.

While metabolic measures remained largely unchanged, the timing of meals did affect circadian rhythms. Analysis of blood cells showed that the internal clock shifted by an average of 40 minutes during the late eating schedule compared to the early schedule. Participants following the later eating window also went to bed and woke up later. ""The timing of food intake acts as a cue for our biological rhythms -- similar to light,"" says first author Beeke Peters.

Calories and Individual Timing May Matter Most

The findings highlight the importance of calorie balance in achieving health benefits from intermittent fasting. ""Those who want to lose weight or improve their metabolism should pay attention not only to the clock, but also to their energy balance,"" Ramich concludes.

Future research will need to explore whether combining time-restricted eating with reduced calorie intake produces stronger benefits. Scientists also aim to better understand how individual factors, including chronotype and genetics, may influence how people respond to different eating schedules.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Age does not stop nerve healing after spinal cord injury","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251228013705.htm","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 08:52:03 GMT","

A study published on December 23, 2025, in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, examined how age may influence recovery following a spinal cord injury.

""With population growth and improvements in medicine, the number of people diagnosed with spinal cord injury is increasing and the average age at the time of injury is rising,"" said study author Chiara Pavese, MD, PhD, of the University of Pavia in Pavia, Italy. ""Despite substantial advances in medicine and surgery over the past decades, the rate of recovery after spinal cord injury has remained the same. Our results may help researchers design studies tailored by people's age to evaluate new therapies and approaches for people with spinal cord injury.""

Nerve Function Recovers Regardless of Age

The researchers found that age did not appear to affect neurological recovery. Older participants regained motor strength and sensory abilities, such as feeling light touch or a pin prick, at levels similar to younger individuals.

These findings suggest that the body's ability to recover nerve function after a spinal cord injury remains largely consistent across different age groups.

Everyday Function Declines With Increasing Age

While nerve recovery was not linked to age, functional recovery showed a different pattern. Older adults experienced greater difficulty regaining independence in daily activities, including feeding, bathing, managing bladder and bowel function, and moving around.

They also showed poorer improvement on walking assessments. These tests measured how quickly a person could walk a short distance, either independently or with assistance such as a cane.

Tracking Recovery in More Than 2,000 Patients

The study included 2,171 people with spinal cord injuries, with an average age of 47. All participants were admitted to spinal care units involved in the European Multicenter Study about Spinal Cord Injury.

Researchers followed participants for one year after their injuries and repeatedly assessed their physical and functional abilities. They then analyzed how age was related to the degree of recovery over that period.

Functional Scores Show Clear Age-Related Differences

No connection was found between age and neurological outcomes, including strength in the arms and legs or sensory responses.

In contrast, functional recovery differed notably by age. Independence in daily activities was measured on a scale from zero to 100, with higher scores reflecting better function. At the time of admission to a spinal care unit, participants had an average score of 31. After one year, the average score increased to 35.

The researchers found that each additional decade of age was linked to a 4.3 point decrease in improvement on this scale. Older participants also showed less progress on every walking-related test compared with younger participants.

These findings remained consistent after accounting for the type of spinal cord injury and its severity.

Recovery Challenges Increase After Age 70

The study identified a particularly noticeable drop in functional recovery among people older than 70.

""People older than 70 need specific approaches to rehabilitation that take into account other conditions they may be living with, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or osteoporosis, and help them with recovery that applies to their daily lives,"" Pavese said.

Study Limitations and Funding

One limitation noted by the researchers was that many individuals included in the original database were no longer part of the study after one year. Limited information was available about why these participants dropped out or whether they died during that time.

Because those who left the study may have differed from those who remained, this could have influenced the results.

The study was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Wings for Life Research Foundation, European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation and Italian Ministry of Health.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New antibiotic pill shows promise against drug-resistant gonorrhea","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251227004149.htm","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 08:21:25 GMT","

Researchers are testing a new oral medication called zoliflodacin that could offer a simpler way to treat gonorrhea, especially strains that no longer respond well to existing antibiotics. In a late-stage phase 3 clinical trial published in The Lancet, scientists found that a single dose of this pill worked just as well as the current standard treatment used today.

Phase 3 trials are the final and largest testing stage before a drug can be approved. They are designed to confirm how well a treatment works and to closely monitor safety in large groups of people. In this case, the results suggest zoliflodacin may be ready to become a real-world option.

Why Gonorrhea Is Becoming Harder to Treat

Gonorrhea is one of the most widespread sexually transmitted infections in the world, with more than 82 million new cases each year. It is caused by a bacterium that infects the reproductive tract and can also affect the throat and rectum. If left untreated, it can lead to serious health problems, including infertility.

One of the biggest challenges in treating gonorrhea is antibiotic resistance. Over time, bacteria can adapt and survive drugs that once killed them. As a result, doctors have fewer effective treatment options. The current recommended therapy relies on two antibiotics: an injection of ceftriaxone followed by an oral dose of azithromycin. This approach works, but it requires access to injections and careful medical supervision.

How the New Treatment Performed in Trials

The new study included more than 900 participants across five countries (USA, South Africa, Thailand, Belgium, and the Netherlands). Volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either zoliflodacin or the standard two-drug treatment.

The results were encouraging. More than 90 percent of genital infections were cured with the single-dose pill. Researchers also found that the drug was generally well tolerated. Side effects were similar to those already seen with existing gonorrhea treatments, and no serious safety concerns were reported during the trial.

What FDA Review Could Mean Going Forward

Zoliflodacin is now under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency responsible for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of new medications in the United States. Approval would allow the drug to be prescribed more widely.

According to the study authors, access to a one-dose oral treatment could make a major difference worldwide. It could simplify care, support community-led treatment programs, reduce reliance on injections, and help slow the spread of drug-resistant gonorrhea. If approved, the medication could play an important role in protecting reproductive health for millions of people around the globe.

At around 2 am local time in Caracas, Venezuela, US helicopters flew overhead while explosions resounded below. A few hours later, US president Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife had been “captured and flown out of the Country.” US attorney general Pam Bondi followed with a post on X that Maduro and his wife had been indicted in the Southern District of New York and would “soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.”

It has been a stunning series of events, with unknown repercussions for the global world order. If you asked ChatGPT about it this morning, it told you that you're making it up.

WIRED asked leading chatbots ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini the same question a little before 9 am ET. In all cases, we used the free, default version of the service, since that's what the majority of users experience. We also asked AI search platform Perplexity, which advertises “accurate, trusted, and real-time answers to any question.” (While Perplexity Pro users have access to a wide range of third-party AI models, the default, free search experience routes users to different models based on a variety of factors.)

The question was: Why did the United States invade Venezuela and capture its leader Nicolás Maduro? The responses were decidedly mixed.

Credit to Anthropic and Google, whose respective Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Gemini 3 models gave timely responses. Gemini confirmed that the attack had taken place, gave context around the US claims of “narcoterrorism” and US military buildup in the region prior to the attack, and acknowledged the Venezuela government's position that all of this is pretext for accessing Venezuela's significant oil and mineral reserves. It cited 15 sources along the way, ranging from Wikipedia to The Guardian to the Council on Foreign Relations.

Claude initially balked. “I don't have any information about the United States invading Venezuela or capturing Nicolás Maduro. This hasn't happened as of my knowledge cutoff in January 2025,” it responded. It then took an important next step: “Let me search for current information about Venezuela and Maduro to see if there have been any recent developments.”

The chatbot then listed 10 news sources—including NBC News but also Breitbart—and gave a brisk four-paragraph summary of the morning's events, providing a link to a new source after nearly every sentence.

ChatGPT did not course-correct. Instead, it emphatically refuted that Maduro had been captured at all. “That didn't happen,” it wrote. “The United States has not invaded Venezuela, and Nicolás Maduro has not been captured.” It then rationalized:

""What's likely going on is a mix-up with real events that are often described in dramatic or misleading ways online. Here's what actually has happened:

❌ No U.S. military invasion of Venezuela

❌ No arrest or capture of Nicolás Maduro

❌ No overthrow of the Venezuelan government by U.S. forces

Maduro is still in power in Venezuela.""

It went on to detail recent tensions between the US and Venezuela and explained that “confusion” can happen because of “sensational headlines,” “social media misinformation,” and “confusing sanctions, charges, or rhetoric with actual military action.”

Perplexity was similarly scolding. “The premise of your question is not supported by credible reporting or official records: there has been no invasion of Venezuela by the United States that resulted in capturing Nicolás Maduro,” it responded. “In fact, the U.S. has not successfully invaded or apprehended Maduro, and he remains the Venezuelan president as of late 2025. If you're seeing sensational claims, they likely originate from misinformation or hypothetical scenarios rather than factual events.”

“Perplexity never claims to be 100 percent accurate, but we do claim to be the only AI company focused on building more accurate AI,” says Perplexity spokesperson Beejoli Shah. OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

To be clear, this is expected behavior. ChatGPT 5.1's “knowledge cutoff”—the point at which it no longer has new training data to draw from—is September 30, 2024. (Its more advanced model, ChatGPT 5.2, extends that cutoff to August 31, 2025.) Claude Sonnet 4.5 has a “reliable knowledge cutoff” of January 2025, though its training data is recent to July of last year. It was able to answer the Maduro question because it also has a web search tool for tapping into real-time content. Gemini 3 models have a knowledge cutoff of January 2025 as well but unsurprisingly tap into Google search for queries requiring more up-to-date information. And Perplexity is only as good as the model it's tapping into—although it's again unclear which one that was in this case.

“Pure LLMs are inevitably stuck in the past, tied to when they are trained, and deeply limited in their inherent abilities to reason, search the web, ‘think' critically, etc.,” says Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and author of Taming Silicon Valley: How We Can Ensure That AI Works for Us. While human intervention can fix glaring problems like the Maduro response, Marcus says, that doesn't address the underlying problem. “The unreliability of LLMs in the face of novelty is one of the core reasons why businesses shouldn't trust LLMs.”

The good news, at least, is that people don't seem to be relying on AI as a primary news source quite yet. According to a survey from the Pew Research Center released in October, 9 percent of Americans say they get their news sometimes or often from AI chatbots, and 75 percent said they never get news that way. It also seems unlikely that many people would take ChatGPT's word over the entirety of the news media, the Trump administration, and objective reality itself.

But as chatbots become more ingrained in people's lives, remembering that they're likely to be stuck in the past will be paramount to navigating interactions with them. And it's always worth noting how confidently wrong a chatbot can be—a trait that's not limited to breaking news.

One of the changes that we've seen in phones over recent years has been more control over the file systems. Having previously hidden away a lot of the local storage structure, Android and iOS now both give you easy access to it so you can manage your files similar to how you would on Windows or macOS.

It reflects a few gradual changes in the phones that we carry around with us, including increasing amounts of onboard storage space, increasingly complex apps, and increasingly sophisticated operating systems. Links with cloud storage platforms are also now more common than ever, which adds to the need for local file management tools.

While there are several file managers to use, particularly on Android, we're going to focus on the tools that come built into Android and iOS, and what you can do with them. Besides giving you a better idea of what files you've got and where they are, these apps will also help you free up space on your devices.

If you own an Android phone of some description, you'll find the Files app from Google is preinstalled. Open the app and you should see recently saved files first, then different file categories that you can browse through, including Downloads, Images, Videos, and Documents. You can also search for files using the box at the top.

Farther down the screen, you can access every folder on your file via the Internal storage button and every cloud storage account you've connected to Android via the Other storage button. There's also access to your Safe folder here, which is a special folder you can protect with a PIN and use to store particularly sensitive files.

Once you're within a specific folder or file category, you're able to tap on any file to open it—for formats that cannot be opened within the Files app itself, you'll be prompted to choose a different app on your phone to handle it. Tap the grid or list icon in the top right corner to change the folder view, and the three dots (also top right), then Sort by to change the order in which files are shown. New folders can be added from the same menu.

Tap the three dots next to any file to open up a menu that shows a wealth of options related to that file. Among the actions you can take here are renaming, sharing, moving, and copying the file, as well as shifting it to the Trash folder (where it will stay for 30 days before being permanently deleted).

From this menu, you're also able to see more info for a file and back it up to cloud storage. If you need to select multiple files to take action on together, tap and hold on the first file you want to pick until the checkboxes appear, then select any others you need. You can then use the three dots (top right) to find actions like move, copy, and delete.

One other useful feature in the Files app: From the opening screen, tap the menu button (three horizontal lines, top left), then choose Clean to see suggestions for files you can delete to free up space. These might include downloads, large files, unused apps, duplicate files, and screenshots, for example.

Over on the iPhone, file management duties are handled by the Files app developed by Apple. There are three main tabs here to navigate between: Recents (recently created or edited files), Shared (shared files), and Browse (which gives you access to all the files and folders on iOS).

Whenever you're in a folder somewhere in Files, you can tap the three dots (top right) to find the view options for that folder: You can change the order the files are shown in, and switch between the Icons and List views. The same menu has a Select option, which you can use for picking and taking action on several files at once, and a New Folder option.

The Browse tab is the most useful part of the Files app: From here you can jump to numerous local and cloud locations, including iCloud Drive, On My iPhone, and any other third-party cloud storage accounts you've connected to iOS. Recently deleted files and tagged files can be accessed from here too.

Right at the top there's a search box you can use for looking for specific files. Otherwise, tap on any of the locations to browse through the folders. For a lot of file types, such as PDF documents and image files, you can simply tap a file to open it. For other formats, Files might launch a separate app on your iPhone, such as Pages or Numbers.

To access file operations, press and hold on a file. If you've selected multiple files, use the icons and the three dots at the bottom of the screen. You're able to rename, copy, move, share, and delete files from these menus. (Deleted files will go to the Recently Deleted folder for 30 days before being permanently erased.)

For files that are synced with iCloud Drive, you also have the option of downloading files permanently to your device. This takes up more storage space of course, but it means you can get at these files more quickly, and without an internet connection. This only appears when you're browsing through the iCloud Drive section of Files: Any files that aren't stored locally have a small cloud symbol next to them, and you can manage their status with a long press on the file icon itself.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How to Protect Your iPhone or Android Device From Spyware","https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protect-your-iphone-or-android-device-from-spyware/","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT","

In December, hundreds of iPhone and Android users received a threat notification, warning them their device had been targeted by spyware. Days later, Apple and Google patched security holes that experts think were used to plant the stealthy malware on a select group of devices.

Spyware is so dangerous because the adversary is able to see and hear everything you do on your smartphone, including via encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal. But it tends to be extremely targeted against dissidents, journalists, politicians, and business leaders operating in certain sectors.

The malware has hit a number of high-profile people, including former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Hanan Elatr, wife of murdered Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi—who were both compromised by NSO Group's Pegasus spyware.

Today, spyware remains just as prolific in these circles, but experts think its impact could be widening. In early December, as Google issued its threat notification, the tech firm's researchers detailed how an exploit chain was used to install Predator spyware surreptitiously onto a device.

It came after an alert issued by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), warning users that adversaries are “actively leveraging” commercial spyware to target mobile messaging applications.

As the risk increases, what can you do to protect your Android device or Apple iPhone?

Spyware often hits smartphones in so-called zero-click attacks, meaning your phone can become infected without clicking a link, downloading a malicious image, or any other kind of user interaction.

The attack cannot be mitigated via the usual routes. If the malware has infected your smartphone, adversaries can “read messages, observe keystrokes, take screenshots, monitor notifications, and access banking apps,” according to Pieter Arntz, a senior malware researcher at security firm Malwarebytes.

With full system access, spyware can “exfiltrate data such as emails and texts, send messages, steal credentials, and log in to cloud systems,” says Rocky Cole, cofounder of iVerify, an app that helps users to detect spyware.

Aside from zero-click attacks, spyware can infect a device when someone clicks on a compromised link sent over text, email, or social media. Meanwhile, the malware can hide in malicious apps that appear to be legit. It can also be concealed in an image file and downloaded via a message, or get onto your smartphone due to vulnerabilities in your browser.

Infection usually starts through malicious links and fake apps, but it is also taking place via “more subtle methods,” says Richard LaTulip, a field CISO at security company Recorded Future, which collaborated with Google's threat intelligence team on the Predator spyware findings.

LaTulip cites the example of recent research on malicious browser extensions affecting millions of users that shows “how seemingly harmless tools can become surveillance devices.”

These techniques, often developed by nation-state adversaries linked to governments, indicate a trend toward “more covert, persistent, and device-level compromises,” he says.

Over the past few years, spyware has become a growing issue. Governments and the companies that make the malware say the surveillance tools are used to target only criminals and terrorists, or for national security purposes.

“But the truth is that human rights activists, journalists, and many others across the world have been unlawfully targeted with spyware,” Rebecca White, Amnesty International's researcher on targeted surveillance, tells WIRED. “In this way, spyware can be used as a tool of repression—to silence people speaking truth to power.”

Thai activist Niraphorn Onnkhaow is a prime example. Between 2020 and 2021, at the height of Thailand's pro-democracy protests, Onnkhaow was targeted 14 times by Pegasus spyware. Soon afterward, she decided to end her role in the protest movement amid fears that her private data could be weaponized against her.

“Data can be weaponized and lead to more abuse, online and offline—especially for people who already face discrimination based on their identity; for example, on the basis of gender or race,” White says.

Beyond activists, mobile spyware appears to be targeting a wider subset of people, often within a business environment. The malware is hitting “a wide range of society,” from government officials to financial IT workers, says iVerify's Cole. “Increasingly, it's used beyond intelligence gathering, to steal credentials for enterprise access.”

Spyware is difficult to detect—especially sophisticated strains such as Pegasus and Predator, which are typically only discovered via forensic analysis. But you might notice some subtle signs, such as your device overheating or slowing down, or your camera or mic activating when they're not supposed to be in use.

While advanced spyware may leave little to no visible trace, sudden drops in performance or changes in connectivity can serve as early warning signs, says LaTulip.

One more obvious indicator of being hit by a sophisticated campaign is an official threat notification from Apple, Meta, or Google. This “should be taken seriously,” White says.

Another sign is leaked private information that you haven't shared previously, or if colleagues or friends have been compromised.

The most reliable way to mitigate spyware is to prevent your device being taken over in the first place. If you think you may be at risk, Apple offers Lockdown Mode, which includes a higher level of security with reduced functionality that has improved over time as the feature has been updated. For example, it blocks most message attachments and incoming FaceTime calls.

To enable Lockdown Mode on your iPhone, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode and tap Turn On Lockdown Mode.

Ivan Krstić, vice president of Apple security engineering and architecture, tells WIRED there “has never been a successful, widespread malware attack” against the iPhone. The only system-level iOS attacks Apple has seen in the wild come from mercenary spyware, according to the iPhone maker. In other words, iPhones have been infected with spyware, but only the most sophisticated type, Krstić says.

Krstić describes how mercenary spyware is “historically associated with state actors and costs millions of dollars to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices.” He adds that Apple has continued to develop new methods for combating spyware, including Lockdown Mode and Memory Integrity Enforcement.” Introduced alongside the latest iPhone line-up, Memory Integrity Enforcement is a “comprehensive, always-on memory-safety protection,” which helps prevent memory corruption exploits often used in spyware attack chains.

Krstić is confident about Memory Integrity Enforcement's advancements, claiming that the new feature is “the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.”

Google offers spyware protection for Android called Advanced Protection, which has been enhanced in Android 16 with intrusion logging, USB protection and the option to disable auto-reconnect to insecure networks. It can be enabled via your Settings > Security & Privacy > Other Settings > Advanced Protection.

In addition to using anti-spyware features, all users should be mindful of clicking links from strangers, says White. “Pay attention to changes in devices' functioning. Using a reputable VPN can help prevent some forms of surveillance and censorship,” she says. “Evaluate any new requests for social media followers before accepting. Visit Amnesty's secure onion website, privately and anonymously, using the Tor network's browser.”

More generally, exercise “strict control” over what gets installed on your device, adds Arntz.

At the same time, avoid side-loading on Android and ensure your mobile operating system and apps are fully updated. “Patches often close the same vulnerabilities that spyware relies on,” warns LaTulip.

Experts say spyware can be temporarily disrupted by turning your smartphone off and on again. However, if the malware does get on your device, the best course of action is to ditch it altogether.

Alongside Amnesty, several organizations can support members of civil society concerned they have been targeted with spyware, such as Access Now and Reporters Without Borders.

Above all, operate with a healthy skepticism, says LaTulip. “Assume compromise is possible, but avoid the paranoia that shuts down normal use.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Stop Using Your Keyboard and Start Using This Simple, Free Speech-to-Text App","https://www.wired.com/story/handy-free-speech-to-text-app/","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

If old sci-fi shows are anything to go by, we're all using our computers wrong. We're still typing with our fingers, like cave people, instead of talking out loud the way the future was supposed to be. Have you ever seen Picard touch a keyboard? Of course not.

And it's odd because our computers are all capable of turning speech into text by default. The problem? It just doesn't work very well. Or, at least, it didn't. In recent years AI models like Nvidia's Parakeet and OpenAI's Whisper, both open source, have made great strides in turning human voices into text. Both excel at correctly adding things like punctuation and capitalization, and you can run them right on your computer. Using these models is the closest I've felt to recording a captain's log—it just works.

The problem? They're both a little complicated to set up. That's where Handy comes in. This is a dead-simple, totally free application that can set up either of these models on your computer and give you a keyboard shortcut to use it. It was created by CJ Pais after he broke his finger, rendering him unable to type. He wanted a totally free, and radically simple, way to use existing AI speech-to-text tools.

To get started simply download Handy—there are versions offered for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Run the application and you'll be asked which model you want to use.

The default, Parakeet V3, is a great place to start—I didn't feel the need to try out other models after using it.

It will take a bit for the model to download, but when it does you can start using the application by pressing and holding the keyboard shortcut. By default it's Control-Space on Windows and Linux or Option-Space on macOS. You'll see an overlay at the bottom of the screen, letting you know that you're being recorded and transcribed. Holding the keyboard shortcut you can talk for as long as you like—when you're done the text will show up in whatever text box is currently active.

I've been using this to write the article today, and an impressive thing is I don't even have to turn my music off—the models are good at filtering it out. I don't know if that would work in all environments, granted, but my music was pretty loud, and it worked well. I even tried speaking a few sentences in French and Spanish—it worked (and, I imagine, would work even better if my pronunciation weren't horrible).

Honestly, for most people, this is all you need to do—download the application, choose a model, and use it whenever you'd otherwise be typing something. But you can customize things a little.

You can pick a custom keyboard shortcut, and you can decide to simply press that shortcut instead of pressing and holding it. You can also choose which microphone you want to use and whether there should be audio feedback at the beginning and end of recording.

The advanced settings let you refine things a little further, starting the software when your computer boots up and changing how long the models stay open on your computer. You can also add custom words, useful if you regularly say a name or word the model seems to constantly mis-transcribe.

Most people, though, won't need to think about any of this—and that's what's great about this software. It does the job and otherwise stays out of the way. And, because it's completely free, it also doesn't bother you about things like upgrading, which is a nice change of pace in the world of AI-based technology.

If you're at all curious about talking instead of typing, I can't recommend Handy enough. Give it a shot. Personally, I'll probably keep using my keyboard to write articles—I type faster than I can think. But if I ever hurt my hand in any way, I'm going to be very thankful this tool exists.

At this moment in time, the President has bombed Caracas (presumably under the War Powers Act [1]) and claims to have captured Maduro.From here, there are paths that wind up marginally good and many that end up somewhat catastrophically.

The Stranger Things finale hit theaters on New Year's Eve. Yet despite doing pretty good with that one-day release, it seems Netflix still isn't a fan of the theatrical experience when it doesn't need to be.

Because of the cast's contractual terms for residuals, there aren't box office numbers to report for screenings, but Deadline and other outlets reported the finale made $25 million-$30 million worth of concession cash in its 620 screenings across North America. That concession money technically means the episode beat out KPop Demon Hunters as Netflix's highest theatrical owner for 2025. The finale is also a particular win for AMC, which didn't screen KPop during that movie's time(s) in theaters, but reported more than half of all Stranger Things fans watched it at an AMC theater.

You'd think this would be good news as the streamer's looking to snatch up Warner Bros.—which had a pretty strong big screen run in 2025—and honor that studio's policy of putting its movies in theaters, but sources speaking to Deadline claim Netflix is considering a 17-day window for any of its potential films. That's less than half of the 45-day standard adhered to by WB and other Hollywood studios, and AMC and other theatrical chains would very much prefer that standard maintained. Exhibitors would also love for more theatrical runs from Netflix, with the Stranger finale working as a possible “olive branch” to help get that ball rolling.

But if that alleged 17-day window happens, it'd “steamroll” the movie theater business and be bad for everyone in general. At time of writing, Netflix hasn't disclosed any moves it aims to make should it get to acquire WB, instead keeping to its stance in December that things will currently be business as usual. But common sense and the streamer's own past will tell you that things will be anything but, and eventually, that other shoe will drop.

A PR nightmare that could've easily been avoided.

A couple of days ago, Corsair's webstore listed a 48GB kit of Dominator Titanium DDR5 RAM for just $239.99 — a price too reasonable to be true given the worldwide shortage. Naturally, many people swept up this deal, but instead of receiving a confirmation, they got a different message after checkout. Corsair cancelled all the orders, citing a listing error while apologizing for the inconvenience via email.

The post below is Corsair's official statement on the matter, posted on Reddit and X. The company says the SKU was priced incorrectly, and that it was never in stock to begin with, despite showing a pre-order button to buyers. Moreover, Corsair clarifies that it doesn't sell memory based on pre-orders at the moment, so this was entirely an oversight.

Customers affected by this will be fully refunded and issued a compensatory coupon on top. According to reports online, that was initially a 15% storewide discount that was (mistakenly, again) set to expire on October 31, 2025, so Corsair later added a blanket 40% off for future RAM orders as well. Unfortunately, by then, the damage had already been done.

NOTICE: DRAM Cancellations - Webstore Pricing ErrorOn January 1, our webstore mistakenly listed an out-of-stock memory kit - DOMINATOR TITANIUM RGB 48GB (2x24GB) DDR5 6400MT/s CL36 (SKU: CMP48GX5M2B6400C36) at an incorrect price. Due to an internal systems error, the item…January 2, 2026

Complaints started popping up on Corsair's official subreddit, where the mods made matters worse by turning off comments and deleting certain posts. Over on the r/pcmasterrace subreddit, one customer reeling from the cancellation has already amassed over 16,000 upvotes, where the OP claims the same RAM kit is now price-hiked to $500+, though we couldn't confirm that since it's actually marked out-of-stock now.

While the community backlash has been scathing, there have been some divisive comments, wondering how this is unfair, so it's important to highlight what actually went wrong. Let's be real: that $240 ask for such a premium DDR5 RAM kit was already a bit of a stretch even without the DRAM shortage; with that in place, it was definitely impossible.

However, the onus is on Corsair, since it still listed the kit at that price, mistake or not, which means the company had to honor the sale once the product was in the customer's cart and had passed checkout. You'll find anecdotes in the comment threads saying that stores like Micro Center will simply let you keep the incorrectly-priced item, since it was never your mistake.

Instead, by cancelling those orders, Corsair created a PR nightmare for itself. The funny bit is that just a few hours before this fiasco unfolded, the company had cancelled an order for a prebuilt PC worth $3,500, only to raise its price by $800 afterward. The community, therefore, was already on high alert, so for Corsair to pull off something like this was quite brave, for lack of a better term.

Some of you might still point to rising DRAM prices, and while that's a fair assumption, the issue isn't jacking up prices after these orders; it's that the brand outright cancelled them all. Corsair doesn't sell memory to AI data centers; its entire business is consumer-facing, so it lives and dies on reputation, which has now been tainted.

Corsair made things right for the disappointed gamer.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A Redditor posted on the r/Corsair subreddit, complaining that the company cancelled their $3,499 pre-built PC order on New Year's Day, only to discover that the unit had been raised to $4,299 the following day. Senior_Ball_9068 said on the post, “I believe that they cancelled my order exactly because they raised the price.” This is a massive $700 price hike, especially at a time when memory prices are hitting record highs, leading to significant disappointment for users.

Thankfully, a Community Captain took notice and messaged the user to get their order number and get to the bottom of things. According to u/CorsairLucky, “The order was flagged by our fraud detection system and was canceled as a result. On January 1st, our Holiday Deals promo pricing ended, and the normal pricing was reinstated. But we'll be getting OP taken care of!”

It seems that Corsair sent a coupon to u/Senior_Ball_9068, allowing them to repurchase their order at the sale price. More than that, they'll also monitor the order, ensuring it reaches the Redditor so they can enjoy the new year with a brand-new gaming rig.

This is a commendable move by Corsair, especially given that the OP wasn't at fault. And while we're unsure whether they reached out to Corsair customer service to fix the issue, it seems their Reddit post gained a lot of traction, catching the company's attention. The Redditor ordered the Corsair Vengeance a5100 gaming PC, which comes with an AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, 32GB (2x16GB) of DDR5-6400, and a 2TB M.2 NVMe SSD. The original $4,299 is indeed too much for a build like this, but the $3,499 sale price seems reasonable.

We looked at the specifications for the gaming PC and built something close using PCPartPicker. The total price of the custom build should be around $3,120. While many enthusiasts will not pay the $380 premium that Corsair charges for its pre-built PC, the Redditor said that they prefer that because they “never had the experience of building a PC myself” and that they did not want to “break…something up in the process.”

And even though others say that it's easy to learn building one from scratch, it's probably something that the OP doesn't want to risk, and that they're willing to pay extra for the privilege of not having to think which parts to order, worry about putting it together, and the peace of mind of warranty coverage for the entire PC.

Gigabyte is capitalizing on the resurgence in demand for AM4.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Gigabyte is capitalizing on the ongoing resurgence in demand for AM4 motherboards as DDR5 RAM prices continue to rise. Spotted by TechPowerUp, the board maker has released four brand new boards, two on the A520 chipset and two on the B550 chipset, featuring a mix of Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX variants.

Most of the four boards are new iterations of existing models sporting minor upgrades to make them more modern, such as the addition of ARGB lighting or WiFi support. The Aorus B550I Pro AX 1.4 is the most premium board of the bunch, featuring a Mini-ITX form factor and, as the name implies, onboard Wi-Fi 6E. The board also comes with an 8-phase VRM power delivery system, PCIe 4.0 support, dual NVMe PCIe 4.0 slots, 2.5Gb Ethernet, dual HDMI ports, and USB 3.2 Gen 2 support. This variant is a revision upgrade over the Aorus B550I Pro AX 1.3 with no changes according to the spec sheet.

The B550M H ARGB is a new Micro-ATX variant based on the Ultra Durable series, featuring ARGB lighting compatibility, which the outgoing B550M H and B550M S2H models lack. The ARGB trim also features some other modifications, including the removal of the DVI port in favor of a DisplayPort connector. The graphics on the motherboard are also slightly different. The board features two DDR4 slots and PCIe 4.0 support via a single M.2 connector.

The A520I AC rev 1.5 is yet another revision update, just like the Aorus model above. But unlike that board, this A520 board does come with one change over its older counterparts. Gigabyte changed the Wi-Fi card from an Intel AC 3168 Wi-Fi 5 card to a Realtek AW-CB304NF Wi-Fi 5 card. Other than that, the two boards are seemingly identical. The A520I AC sports a mini-ITX form factor with a six-phase VRM power delivery setup, six USB ports in the rear, and a single PCIe 3.0 M.2 slot.

The A520M H ARGB is likely the cheapest board of the bunch, and also has a noteworthy amount of changes from the vanilla A520M H. The rear I/O removes a DVI port in favor of a DisplayPort connector, new headers are added for ARGB support, and the board removes a single PCIe x1 slot at the bottom, leaving just a single PCIe x16 and one PCIe x1 slot. The board features six USB ports in the rear, two DDR4 slots, and a single M.2 slot running at PCIe 3.0 speeds.

Gigabyte's focus back on AM4 is more evidence that buyers are flocking back to AMD's almost 10-year-old socket to build new systems as everyone weathers the storm of skyrocketing DDR5 consumer memory prices. AM4 is the only AMD socket that supports DDR4 memory. Despite DDR4 memory production having mostly ceased already, DDR5 memory prices have shot up so quickly that they have overtaken average DDR4 pricing, even at DDR4's elevated prices (from lack of production). You can still buy a 2x8GB (16GB) kit of DDR4 memory for just under $100 and a 2x16GB (32GB) kit for around $160-$180.

We really started to see consumers shift their focus to AM4 in mid-December, when Ryzen 7 5800X3D prices on eBay skyrocketed above Ryzen 7 9800X3D prices. Even now, Amazon's best-sellers list is dominated by AM4-based Ryzen 5000 CPUs, with the Ryzen 7 5800XT ranking 4th. Even AMD's old Zen 2-based Ryzen 5 3600 is in the list, ranking as Amazon's 6th most popular CPU sold.

The end of text fringing on QD-OLED?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Samsung's QD-OLED technology has gone head-to-head against LG's WOLED with one distinct advantage: better color volume. By using a blue emitter and quantum dots, the company turns an otherwise reductive filtering process into an additive outcome. As a side effect, they employ unconventional subpixel layouts, which make QD-OLEDs suffer from inferior text clarity. Fortunately, Samsung Display is finally addressing this at CES 2026.

The company has just announced mass production of the ""world's first 360Hz V-Stripe QD-OLED,"" with a new 34-inch ultrawide panel. The V-Stripe refers to the subpixels being arranged vertically, like on a typical LCD, which Windows' font engine is most comfortable with. For years, QD-OLEDs have relied on triangular subpixel arrangements, leading to poor text clarity and fringing visible at the edges.

Samsung's ""V-Stripe"" naming convention is a bit confusing because it may imply a V-shaped layout. However, TFT Central confirmed that it refers to red, green, and blue subpixels arranged vertically next to each other, like upright pillars. Then, whole pixels are aligned horizontally next to each other. This should significantly reduce text fringing and improve clarity at even lower resolutions.

The Reddit post above sheds more light on this new panel, courtesy of a hands-on article from para.de that's since been deleted. The red subpixel is the largest here because it carries a disproportionate share of perceived brightness — especially important in QD-OLED — while the blue subpixel is kept smallest because it's inefficient, ages fastest, and has to be almost babied to protect the panel's lifetime.

Samsung is not out to fundamentally change panel physics; rather, it's an attempt to make the subpixel spacing even again. Even before this, the issue had been greatly alleviated by brute-forcing pixel density. Higher resolutions on the same-sized panels have increased the PPI to the point where it masks inconsistencies in the subpixel layout.

Still, the problem was never truly eliminated from the root, and Samsung's 34-inch ultrawide panels, in particular, had been stuck on older tech that lacked these improvements. They're not 4K or 5K-class panels like some other QD-OLED displays, so the upgrade matters most here.

""By leveraging QD-OLED's top emission structure, which offers brightness advantages, along with improvements in organic material efficiency and design optimization, we were able to mass-produce a high-performance monitor display that integrates four key features: the 'V-Stripe' pixel structure, an ultra-wide aspect ratio, a high refresh rate, and enhanced brightness."" — Samsung Display spokesperson

Speaking of which, the other specs of this new panel are nothing to scoff at either. We're looking at a 34-inch ultrawide panel with a 1800R curvature and a fast 360 Hz refresh rate. Samsung Display has also achieved 1,300 nits of peak brightness for the first time on a QD-OLED panel, and monitors using it will be certified for HDR True Black 500, meaning 500 nits of peak brightness across 100% of the panel.

This new panel will debut at CES with options from a range of brands, including Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI, who've been supplied these panels since December 2025. That puts a retail launch at least a few months away, and even then, this will be one expensive monitor. No word on pricing yet, but we should learn more very soon.

Deep-tech giant YPlasma is preparing to announce a new solid-state cooling solution for laptops at CES 2026. According to a blog post the company published, the new cooler design can cool laptop devices at an ""ultra-quiet"" 17 dBA using the world's first DBD plasma actuators for consumer electronics. The company also announced that this same cooling design will be used to address the cooling needs of power-hungry AI-focused servers.

This new cooler design uses ""Dielectric Barrier Discharge plasma actuators"" to generate airflow without any moving components. According to YPlasma's literature review of the technology: ""Wind is generated by ionizing a thin layer of ambient gas adjacent to a dielectric surface..."" YPlasma's coolers are taking advantage of corona discharge, an electrohydrodynamic phenomenon, to generate wind using electricity.

The solid-state nature of this cooler design also enabled YPlasma to make it incredibly tinny. The cooler's actuators can measure as thin as 200 microns, making it allegedly well-suited for integration directly onto heat sinks or internal components.

What makes YPlasma's design different from Frore System's AirJet solid-state coolers is the integration of plasma into the cooling solution. YPlasma claims that others have explored ionic cooling using corona discharge, but it has made strides in making it safe for consumer use. A big part of this is the use of a dielectric barrier to limit harmful ozone byproducts from being exposed to the surrounding environment.

If this cooling design sounds at all familiar, Frore Systems developed the world's first solid-state cooler a few years back and has since seen its cooler designs implemented in small-form-factor PCs and laptops. Solid-state cooling is a new, growing category of cooler designs that can cool electronics without any moving parts, providing super-quiet operation and low energy consumption in incredibly small form factors. But instead of using plasma, the AirJet uses ultrasonic frequencies to generate airflow.

YPlasma has not released any precise statistics on the cooling capabilities of its new solid-state laptop cooler, but it's likely to be as competitive as Frore System's solid-state AirJet coolers, based on YPlasma's claim that its cooling tech will be an effective solution for power-hungry AI servers. The company will have a live demo of the device at CES 2026 starting at 4 PM on January 7th.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Brain aging: Creative pursuits may help support brain health","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/dancing-reading-and-video-games-could-help-delay-brain-aging","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 06:40:16 GMT","

Past research shows that engaging in creative activities, such as arts and crafts, dancing, playing a musical instrument, reading, gardening, and even playing video games, can help keep the brain healthy as we age. 

“As populations age, more and more people live long enough to experience cognitive decline and dementia, which are very costly not only for health systems but also for families and caregivers,” Aneta Brzezicka, PhD, psychologist and head of the Center for Neurocognitive Research at SWPS University in Poland, told Medical News Today.

“If we can identify everyday activities that help the brain stay ‘younger' for longer, we may be able to delay the onset of problems with memory, attention, and independence, and improve quality of life in older age,” Brzezicka noted.

She is the co-author of a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications, which found that not only can creative pursuits help with brain health, they may also help delay brain aging. 

For this study, researchers analyzed health data, including neuroimaging, from more than 1,400 participants from 13 countries.

Within the participant group, some were considered experts in dancing the tango, musicians, visual artists, and action video game players. 

“Creative and artistic activities — such as dancing, making music, drawing, or even playing complex strategy video games — naturally combine many ingredients that are beneficial for the brain: They are cognitively demanding, emotionally engaging, often social, and they require fine motor coordination,” Brzezicka explained.

“There has been a lot of interest in the arts and creativity as tools to promote well-being, but we still know very little about whether they are linked to slower biological aging of the brain itself,” she added.

Scientists also utilized computational models called “brain clocks” to help them estimate each participant's brain age. 

“A brain clock is a mathematical model, an algorithm, that learns how brain activity typically changes with age, and then uses this knowledge to estimate how old a new brain looks,” Brzezicka detailed. “In our case, we trained the clock on EEG (electroencephalogram) and MEG (magnetoencephalography) recordings from more than 1,200 people aged 17 to 91 from different countries.”

“When we feed a new person's brain electrical activity into this model, it gives us a predicted ‘brain age',” she continued.

“If this predicted age is higher than their actual age, it suggests accelerated brain aging; if it is lower, it suggests their brain is aging more slowly. The difference between predicted and real age is what we call the ‘brain age gap',” said Brzezicka.

At the study's conclusion, researchers found that people who participated in creative activities tended to have a younger brain age. And the youngest brain ages were seen in participants who had spent years developing their skills in a particular activity. 

“Across all four domains — tango dancing, music, visual arts, and strategy video games — experts had brain-activity patterns that the algorithm judged to be on average about 4 to 7 years ‘younger' than well-matched non-experts of the same age, sex, and education. This effect was seen in brain networks that are vulnerable to aging, especially fronto-parietal regions involved in attention, coordination, and complex decision-making.” 

– Aneta Brzezicka, PhD

“We observed it not only in long-term experts in tango, music, and visual arts, but also in the group involved in our video-game training study, where participants were taught to play a complex strategy game,” Brzezicka told us.

“The significance is that very different forms of creativity seem to converge on a similar brain benefit. Of course, our study is correlational, so we cannot yet say that creative activity causes slower brain aging, but the pattern is robust and consistent across domains,” she added.

Additionally, scientists discovered that study participants who only engaged in several weeks of target training for about 30 hours in total still provided measurable changes in brain-age indicators. 

“In a training study, people with little previous gaming experience completed about 30 hours of StarCraft II practice,” Brzezicka explained. “After training, their brain-age estimates shifted by roughly three years in the ‘younger' direction, and they also improved both in-game performance and on an attention task, whereas an active control group did not show such changes.” 

“This tells us two important things,” she continued. “First, that the adult brain remains highly plastic and can show measurable changes over a relatively short period of intensive training.“ 

“And second, that brain clocks are sensitive enough to pick up these changes,“ said Brzezicka. “The sample was modest, so we need larger trials, but it suggests that you do not need to be a lifelong expert to potentially gain some brain-health benefits.”

MNT had the opportunity to speak with Raphael Wald, PsyD, a neuropsychologist at the Marcus Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida, about this study. 

“The results of this study reinforce our understanding of the importance of keeping our minds active across a range of activities,” Wald, who was not involved in this research, commented.

“Many people equate intelligence with math and writing, but creativity is a crucial component. Creativity forces us to think abstractly. While math and fact-based knowledge often have one correct response, creative pursuits help push us to forge new ways of thinking,” he noted.

MNT also spoke with Megan Glenn, PsyD, clinical neuropsychologist in Center for Memory and Healthy Aging at Hackensack Meridian Neuroscience Institute at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, likewise not involved in the study.

Glenn commented that her first reaction was feeling intrigued that long-term creative expertise showed such a strong brain-protective effect, which contrasts with the common advice to simply learn any new skill.

“The study's focus on younger participants is a crucial insight; it suggests these benefits are not just for older adults but are about building brain resilience and a ‘cognitive reserve' early in life,” Glenn continued. “This highlights a powerful, proactive strategy for public health, emphasizing that cultivating creative passions can be a long-term investment in preventing accelerated brain aging.”

For those who may want to start participating in some creative pursuits, Glenn suggested first focusing on what genuinely brings them joy or sparks curiosity, as we are far more likely to stick with an activity we love. 

“Explore local resources like community centers, libraries, and online groups for classes or clubs in areas like music, dance, or art,” she suggested. “The key is to start small and choose an activity that feels like play, not a chore, to ensure it becomes a sustainable and rewarding part of your life.” 

And Wald reminded readers that you do not have to be an expert at an artistic pursuit to benefit from it cognitively. 

“If all you can do is fingerpaint, then that is great!” he added. “It's not in the level of skill, it's in the trying.”

ATLANTA – U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team head coach Ciara Crinion has named 20 players for a training camp and two matches in Spain, with the trip running from Jan. 6-15.

The USA will face the Germany U-17 WNT on Jan. 11 in Albir, Spain before taking on the Denmark U-17 WNT on Jan. 14 at Camilo Cano Stadium in La Nucia, Spain.

Seventeen of players named were born in 2009, the birth year cut-off for players to be eligible for the 2026 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, which will be staged in Morocco. Midfielder Loradana Paletta was born in 2011 with midfielder Gigi Zuniga and goalkeeper Avellina Saunders born in 2010.

Seven players on the roster for the Spain trip helped the USA win the 2024 Concacaf Girls' U-15 Championship: forwards Carolina Reyna, Maddie DiMaria, Amari Manning and Deus Stanislaus, midfielders Mia Corona and Paletta, and goalkeeper Ella McNeal. That team was coached by Crinion.

Five players on the roster come from California, three hail from Missouri, one from Kansas, and three from New Jersey.

The camp is part of the Federation's continued focus on the U.S. Way philosophy, which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Morocco's World Cup coup","https://en.as.com/soccer/moroccos-world-cup-coup-f202601-n/","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:24:36 GMT","

According to the agency Hespress, the 2029 Club World Cup, which has also drawn bids from Brazil, the United States, Qatar, and Spain, is “99 percent” likely to be held in Morocco.

A year ago, FIFA opened an office in Rabat to oversee several aspects of the 2030 World Cup, which Morocco will co-host alongside Spain and Portugal. That move could now pave the way for another major tournament to be staged on Moroccan soil the year before: the 2029 Club World Cup.

Hespress reports that the tournament featuring the world's top club sides, and the event that will crown a successor to reigning champion Chelsea, is all but set to take place in Morocco. Despite strong interest from the United States, Brazil, and Qatar, FIFA is said to view Morocco as an ideal host, positioning the event as a launchpad ahead of the national-team World Cup in 2030.

بات المغرب المرشح الأبرز لاحتضان كأس العالم للأندية 2029، في ظل معطيات قوية متداولة داخل كواليس كرة القدم القارية والدولية، تؤكد تقدمه الكبير على باقي الملفات المرشحة، وفق ما أفادت به مصادر مطلعة لهسبورت.وأكد مصدر خاص، متتبع لكواليس الجامعة الملكية المغربية لكرة القدم، وملفات… pic.twitter.com/efQevy2w1q

“Morocco has become the leading candidate to host the 2029 Club World Cup, based on strong indicators circulating in continental and international football,” Hespress said, citing informed sources. One private source familiar with the inner workings of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation and the files of both the African and international federations told Hesport that Morocco's chances of hosting the 2029 edition stand at around 99 percent, while noting that the final decision still depends on an official announcement from FIFA.

“The general trend within decision-making circles has become clear,” the same sources added. FIFA is believed to see hosting the 2029 Club World Cup as an advanced test run of Morocco's infrastructure and organizational capacity, including stadiums, logistics, and its accumulated experience in staging global-scale competitions.

Traditionally, the year before a men's World Cup featured the Confederations Cup, held in the same country as a dress rehearsal for the main event.

In 2025, FIFA shifted to an expanded Club World Cup, staged in the United States for its inaugural edition. The U.S. is also set to be one of the host nations for the next World Cup. In other words, FIFA would be following the same model with Morocco in 2029 ahead of 2030. The US, despite having the resources to host the tournament, would be left out under that scenario.

Morocco is likely to host the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup, according to Moroccan outlet Le Desk. The proposal has gained internal support within FIFA, although a final decision has not yet been announced.

FIFA has been highly impressed by Morocco's organization and delivery while hosting the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in 2025, further strengthening the country's reputation as a reliable host for major international football events.

Morocco's progress across all levels of the game has also been praised. This includes achievements by the senior national team, the U-20 squad, performances in the Arab Cup, and continued development in women's football.

In recent years, the country has successfully staged several high-profile Confederation of African Football (CAF) and FIFA tournaments, earning recognition for its modern stadiums, efficient logistics, and strong football culture.

Morocco is also set to co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal, highlighting FIFA's growing confidence in its organisational capabilities.

The 2029 FIFA Club World Cup is expected to bring together elite clubs from around the world. Hosting the tournament just one year before the 2030 World Cup would further underline Morocco's rising influence in global football.

The most recent Club World Cup was hosted by the United States and won by Chelsea.

When a footballer retires, many fans wonder about the next step in their career. For most, finding a new job within the game seems to be the most natural route – so it is no surprise when a player goes on to try their hand at management.

However, not all stars follow the path of coaching top clubs or one of their former sides. Some take the road less travelled, venturing into areas far removed from the glitz and glamour of Europe's biggest leagues.

Some appear where you least expect but with the biggest World Cup ever this summer you may well recognise a few faces you haven't seen for a while.

Here are some of the best examples of ex-players in unexpected roles as head coach....

Fabio Cannavaro is widely regarded as one of the greatest centre backs of all time. The Italian defender captained Italy to World Cup glory in 2006 and is one of just three defenders to have won the Ballon d'Or trophy.

Cannavaro enjoyed stints at some of Europe's biggest clubs, including Juventus and Real Madrid. However, in retirement, he chose a path few would have predicted – taking charge of Uzbekistan for their first ever World Cup.

Cannavaro's appointment came despite the fact that Uzbek-born Timur Kapadze led the nation to qualify for its first ever World Cup tournament.

Signing a two-year-contract for the White Wolves, Cannavaro will be hoping that his bold move results in success for the Central Asian country.

Fabio Cannavaro won the World Cup in 2006 and will now take Uzbekistan to the tournament

Nolberto Solano - better known as Nobby - is considered a cult hero by Newcastle United fans, who remember him for his impressive left foot and love of playing the trumpet.

However, since retiring, Solano has hung up the boots and placed the trumpet to one side to try his hand in management. Having taken charge of several clubs since retiring in 2012, Solano's most recent step into the managerial role of Pakistan has surprised many.

Pakistan, who are ranked 199th in the FIFA world rankings at the time of writing, aspire to qualify for the 2030 World Cup, but are also focused on establishing professional domestic leagues for both men and women in the meantime.

Solano's first task was to lead Pakistan's Under 23 side into the U23 Asian Cup, however, following an 8-1 defeat to Iraq, and subsequent defeats to Cambodia and Oman, it is clear that a big task lies ahead for the Peruvian.

Nobby Solano was popular at Newcastle and here, performs with his salsa band in 2005

Benni McCarthy's playing career was decorated with high-profile achievements, including winning the Champions League with Porto, a league title with Ajax, and successful spells in the Premier League with Blackburn and West Ham. Following his retirement in 2013, McCarthy took on a number of coaching roles, including the position of a first-team striker's coach at Manchester United from 2022-2024.

Since March 2025, McCarthy has been the head coach of Kenya, a team with a history consisting of suspensions from international football in 2004 and 2006 and from the African Cup of Nations in 2023.

Currently sitting 113th in the FIFA world rankings and having never qualified for the World Cup, Kenya will be hoping that the experienced McCarthy can lead them to success on the international stage at some point.

Benni McCarthy was forwards coach at Old Trafford between 2002 and 2024

Dwight Yorke is mainly remembered as a Manchester United treble winner, for his deadly partnership with Andy Cole and his off-the-pitch partying which earned him the nickname ‘all-night Dwight'.

However, Yorke's post-playing career has seen him demonstrate his professionalism, taking on the head coach role of his home nation Trinidad and Tobago.

As a player Yorke was part of an exciting Trinidad and Tobago team that qualified for the 2006 World Cup. Following his transition into a manager, Yorke has returned home to take charge of the side, bringing his world-class experience with him.

Despite the relative obscurity of Caribbean football on the global stage, Yorke is determined to make an impact. His Premier League pedigree and experience on the international stage allows him to instill ambition and optimism in his squad.

Dwight Yorke formed a fine United partnership with Andy Cole, and is now boss of Trinidad

Fellow Trinidad and Tobago legend Stern John was once one of the most prolific strikers in Major League Soccer and enjoyed stints in England with several clubs, including Nottingham Forrest and Crystal Palace.

John is currently the manager of Caribbean Island country St. Lucia's national team. Despite being a member of CONCACAF – the Confederation of North, Central America and the Caribbean, since 1986, the team has never qualified for the Gold Cup.

Having guided the club to a six-place rise in the FIFA rankings, John- who appeared at the 2006 World Cup with Trinidad & Tobago - will be looking to elevate the small Caribbean island on the international stage.

Stern John  represented Trinidad as a player but is now boss of Caribbean rival St Lucia

Sylvinho, the former Brazilian international - who played for European giants Arsenal, Barcelona, and Inter Milan - is the current head coach of Albania.

Known for his defensive intelligence and attacking full-back runs as a player, he is now bringing his tactical acumen to a national side eager to punch above its weight in Europe.

Adding extra firepower to Sylvinho's setup is former Premier League winner Pablo Zabaleta, who is part of his coaching staff. Zabaleta brings crucial insight to the Albania players, thanks to his experience playing at the highest level.

Having guided Albania to the group stage of the 2024 Euro Championship, Sylvinho will be looking to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, with a crucial qualifying match taking place against Poland next March.

Sylvinho joined Barcelona in 2004 after leaving Celtic, and is now manager of Albania

 The leaked Black Stars jersey is yet to be confirmed by the GFA

The Black Stars jersey for the 2026 World Cup has surfaced online through a leak by Opaleak on X on January 2, 2025.

The jersey features a clean white base accented with bold, abstract line patterns in red, yellow, and green, symbolising Ghana's national colors and cultural vibrancy.

At the center of the chest sits the iconic black star, a powerful emblem of national pride and identity, while the Ghana Football Association crest is positioned beside it. 

A black cobweb‑like design appears in the middle, representing the famous Kwaku Ananse motif.

Ghana drawn in Group L for 2026 FIFA World Cup

The colors and design reflect Ghana's indigenous traditions and national heritage, showcasing them to the world.

However, neither manufacturers PUMA nor the Ghana Football Association (GFA) have confirmed the release of the jersey, as assessments are still ongoing.

The image has, however, sparked mixed reactions on social media, with some football fans commending the design for reflecting Ghanaian culture.

Others also criticised the jersey design, arguing that it is too busy and should have been simplified to avoid being overly colorful.

The Black Stars have been placed in Group L and will battle England, Croatia, and Panama for a place in the knockout phase of the 2026 World Cup.

Ghana will play two matches in the United States and one in Canada.

See the jersey below:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Rasmus Hojlund reborn: How Antonio Conte got Man Utd misfit firing again for Napoli","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/rasmus-hojlund-reborn-how-napoli-coach-antonio-conte-got-man-utd-misfit-firing-again/blt89a571154c8d6234","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 08:00:00 GMT","

After Napoli beat Bologna on December 22 to win the Supercoppa Italiana, Rasmus Hojlund posted a picture of him holding the trophy, accompanied by the words, ""What a great decision looks like."" Unsurprisingly, some Manchester United fans didn't react well to the perceived slight on their club. One comment on Hojlund's Instagram photo with more than 14,000 likes sarcastically congratulated the Dane for finding his 'level' before adding, ""[The] Premier League is too difficult for amateurs.""

The idea that it's easier for strikers to score goals in Serie A is obviously debatable but the online trolls were perfectly entitled to point out that leaving United hadn't really been Hojlund's ""decision"". Throughout the summer, he was very vocal about his desire to stay and ""fight for his spot"" - only to be forced out of Old Trafford by manager Ruben Amorim following the £74 million ($99.5m) acquisition of Benjamin Sesko.

However, even if Hojlund ultimately had little say in his United exit, what's already abundantly clear is that moving to Napoli was the best thing he could have done. ""There were more storied clubs interested"" in his services, according to the Partenopei's sporting director Giovanni Manna. But Hojlund felt a move to the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona was ""exactly what I need right now in my career"" - and it's already proven an inspired choice.

Indeed, a permanent £38m ($51m) move, which is dependent upon Champions League qualification is pretty much ""a formality"" in Manna's eyes - because while Sesko is now struggling even more than the Dane ever did under Amorim, Hojlund has been reborn in Italy thanks to Antonio Conte...

When Hojlund scored on his Napoli debut, Antonio Conte quipped that he had been hoping all along that signing the forward would bring his team the same good fortune as another Old Trafford outcast, Scott McTominay, who had played a starring role in the Partenopei's surprise title triumph in his first season at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.

Luck had had nothing to do with it, though. Conte may be a divisive figure in football but he's also an astute judge of a player's (sometimes hidden) attributes, as well as a magnificent man-manager. McTominay has openly admitted that he felt he had been ""misprofiled"" in Manchester, repeatedly used as a defensive midfielder - and even a centre-back on occasion. Conte, though, could see that the Scot had ""goals in his DNA"" and he couldn't have been more correct, with McTominay scoring 13 times during last season's Scudetto success.

Of course, Conte also has previous when it comes to revitalising a No.9 that has flopped at Old Trafford.

When the Italian finally got the chance to work with Romelu Lukaku at Inter after three previous attempts to sign the striker during his time in charge of Juventus and Chelsea, he transformed the big Belgian into one of the most effective forwards in world football by improving his play with his back to goal.

Crucially, Conte is just as confident that he can do something similar with Hojlund.

""He's a 22-year-old who was on the sidelines at Manchester United,"" the Napoli boss enthused after Hojlund's winner against Genoa on October 5. ""He has significant room for improvement. He needs to work because he has the potential to become a star, and he's proving it.""

There's no denying that Hojlund underwhelmed during his two-year spell at United. At one point during his second season, he went 21 games without a goal - during which time his first touch deserted him and his hold-up play fell apart. Rio Ferdinand was among those that felt Hojlund had also become far too concerned with trying to outmuscle opponents.

""I get frustrated watching because he's always trying to fight the defender and have contact,"" the former United centre-back told TNT Sports. ""Sometimes [you should] release yourself from contact so when you have someone against you, it's easier to take the ball and get into areas where you'll affect the game, in between the posts and in the box.""

It hadn't always been like that, though. There were flashes of the potential star United thought they were buying from Atalanta during a debut campaign in which he became the youngest player in Premier League history to score in six consecutive games.

Furthermore, despite looking utterly bereft of confidence by the tail end of last season, Hojlund remained steadfast in his belief that he could ""deliver goals"" on a consistent basis for United.

""I feel like I've matured a lot, and I feel like I'm ready for what's coming,"" he told reporters in July. ""I'm still very young. People forget that sometimes. Not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22.

""But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better at the basics.""

There's certainly been a noticeable improvement in his link-up play at Napoli, with David Neres having already scored three times from Hojlund assists so far this season.

""Conte gives him confidence and is making him grow,"" Luca Nigriello, a scout and member of the Sport Entertainment Group agency that represents the Denmark international, told TuttoNapoli. ""Rasmus plays, makes mistakes, and learns. He has become hungrier, more consistent. He is a chameleon who adapts to what the team asks and he is also learning new things. He has always been a striker of depth, as seen at Atalanta. Now he is adding movements that are more typical of the penalty area, more like a central reference point, almost like Lukaku.""

Unsurprisingly, Conte is thrilled with the way in which Hojlund is learning how to better lead the line by bringing others into the game at every opportunity - not least because his beloved Lukaku has missed the majority of the season so far through injury.

""Since Hojlund first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role,"" Conte explained, ""because he's starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.""

Of course, all No.9s are judged by their strike-rate and, as Hojlund pointed out in a slightly strange ketchup analogy, the goals are starting to flow again for him.

Hojlund's overall tally of nine goals is hardly remarkable - even if does mean he's already just one away from matching his entire 2024-25 tally for United - but what is noteworthy is that Sunday's decisive double at Cremonese means he's now netted five times in his last five appearances in all competitions.

Consequently, the past comparisons with Erling Haaland no longer seem quite so farcical, with even Kevin De Bruyne stating Hojlund is ""quite similar"" to his fellow Scandinavian striker.

""Both are left-footed and like to attack space,"" the former Manchester City attacking midfielder said, ""and I think that Rasmus has a lot of quality.""

It's obviously a shame that De Bruyne picked up a potential season-ending injury while converting a penalty against Inter two months ago, breaking up a surprisingly promising partnership.

As Hojlund himself wrote after the October 1 win over Sporting CP at the Maradona, ""'Hojlund scores twice in the Champions League after two assists from Kevin de Bruyne' was not on my 2025 bingo card!""

However, Hojlund has continued to thrive without De Bruyne's through-balls and that's clearly down to the ""fact that he is now on a well-functioning team"", as Denmark coach Brian Riemer put it, while Sesko is being starved of service at Amorim's United.

""I honestly believe Hojlund could have been a 25-goal-a-season striker for Manchester United,"" Old Trafford icon Peter Schmeichel told Sky Bet. ""The problem wasn't him – it was the way the team played. The system didn't suit him.

""When players like [Alejandro] Garnacho or [Marcus] Rashford got the ball, they looked only to shoot. The ball into the number nine never came, even though Rasmus was making really good runs.

""The fans saw it. They loved him because he fought, he ran, he gave everything, and he had to play every game because there were no other strikers.

""Of course, when you don't score as a striker, people point to it again and again. But what more could he do without service? I've seen what he can do when he's on form and gets the right service.""

He's certainly getting that at Napoli, and now making the very most of the opportunities coming his way.

Christian Vieri is adamant that Hojlund has it in him to become ""one of the best five strikers in the world"". ""He can score goals, but he knows how to attack deep and wear down defences,"" the ex-Italy striker told the Gazzetta dello Sport. ""He has a strong left foot and is great with his head and his physicality.""

Giampaolo Pazzini, meanwhile, says Hojlund is, thanks to Conte, the ""strongest striker in Serie A alongside Lautaro Martinez"".

""He has undergone an incredible transformation since his arrival,"" the former Inter and AC Milan striker told Sport Mediaset. ""He has always been a good player, but with great instinct, great power, he was something of a wild horse.

""But Conte took him, educated him and raised him. Now he's a fantastic striker because he plays for the team, he doesn't make a single mistake, he never gets anticipated, he plays short, he plays long, he's vicious in front of goal.

""Now he's decisive throughout the match and you also find him helping out in the defensive phase.""

Hojlund certainly has an impressive work ethic - which is unsurprising for someone that idolises Cristiano Ronaldo. Compatriot Christian Eriksen has argued that Hojlund deserves his current good run of form not only because of everything ""he went through at United"" but also all of the effort he's put in on and off the pitch.

It was also telling that when he opened his Napoli account, a number of his former United team-mates, including Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire, were quick to congratulate him on an Instagram post entitled ""First day at the new job didn't disappoint"".

There have been ups and downs since then but when Hojlund says joining Conte's Napoli was exactly what he needed at this particular point in his career, it's impossible to disagree. Leaving United may not have been his decision but it's unquestionably proven a blessing in disguise.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Gianluigi Donnarumma brutally trolled by Sunderland player after raging Man City goalkeeper 'ran length of pitch' to spark post-match bust-up as Pep Guardiola played peacemaker","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/gianluigi-donnarumma-trolled-sunderland-raging-man-city-goalkeeper-post-match-bust-up-pep-guardiola/blt6a83982d218b04ed","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:48:47 GMT","

Sunderland stalwart Luke O'Nien has brutally trolled Manchester City goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma following their heated post-match clash at the Stadium of Light. The Mackems defender didn't play in the goalless Premier League draw but still found time to wind up the Italian stopper, while manager Pep Guardiola appeared to play the role of peacemaker after the game.

Despite racking up an expected goals tally of 2.25, their highest in a Premier League game in which they failed to score since March 2022, City were unable to break down a Sunderland side who claimed a hard-fought point. The result saw Guardiola's team slip four points behind league leaders Arsenal, something the manager was not best pleased about.

He said after the contest: ""It is a tough place to come. The amount of chances we missed in the six-yard box, not difficult ones... We didn't do what we talked about in the first half but in general it was a really good game. It was better second half, the guys did everything. They are a bit heads down, but we have to be heads up because in three days we have a difficult game against Chelsea. We created enough chances and we played well second half. The commitment and the desire in the first half was different. We created enough - the two chances from Savinho in the second half, Jeremy [Doku], Josko [Gvardiol], Phil [Foden] and Erling [Haaland]. We had a lot but, unfortunately, we could not do it.""

City were, naturally, frustrated at failing to pick up all three points on New Year's Day and it was evident that their frustrations got the better of them when Italy international Donnarumma squared up to unused substitute O'Nien at full-time, having been irked by some timewasting on the touchline. The former Paris Saint-Germain man lost his cool, at a time when manager Guardiola tried to diffuse the situation, as Sunderland fans mocked the big Italian. 

And now, the Mackems hero has gone viral for his cheeky comments aimed at Donnarumma on Instagram. He wrote on Friday: ""Nice of their big man to run the length of the pitch to wish me a happy new year. Top man @donnarumma.""

Few fancied Sunderland to stay up this season after all three promoted sides have been relegated for two campaigns in a row. But Regis Le Bris has got the north east outfit flying high in the Premier League, and much of that has been down to their excellent home form. The seventh-placed Black Cats are unbeaten in their own backyard this term, winning five and drawing five of their fixtures. That has included draws with Arsenal, City, Aston Villa, and more, something Le Bris is proud of. 

He said: ""It was a good game against a really strong opponent who are one of the best in Europe. It was important to defend properly. We showed we can defend high and when they came a bit higher with their quality we had to manage the ball in the final third. They created many chances but the character was good. Even when we were on the edge we had one foot, one head, something to protect the ball. It was important to escape their counter-press. They were excellent a few weeks ago at the Etihad and it was impossible to escape their counter-press. We did well with that. We are growing and learning from  different experiences. It's a question of experience as the standards in our team are high. They want to get better. If you stay at the same level, the league is going so fast that you'll be finished. They are still ambitious. They're [the home crowd] really important, especially in defensive moments. They push us, it's important for our game.""

Second-placed City will hope to bounce back from this disappointing result when they host Chelsea at the Etihad on Sunday, whereas Sunderland travel to Tottenham on the same day. If results go their way, the Black Cats could climb to fifth in the table, while City can cut the gap to Arsenal to one point if they win and the Gunners lose.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Xabi Alonso explains Real Madrid's decision to send Endrick out on loan after Brazilian completes Lyon transfer","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/xabi-alonso-real-madrid-endrick-lyon-transfer/blt01d230694fc2d10f","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:01:39 GMT","

Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso has revealed Endrick's ambition was behind the decision to allow him to join Lyon on loan for the remainder of the season. The Brazil star has been frustrated at his lack of playing time at the Bernabeu and has been granted his wish to leave in a bid to secure a place in the squad for this year's World Cup in North America, Canada and Mexico. 

Endrick signed for Real Madrid in the summer of 2024 from Palmeiras after an impressive spell in Brazil where he won back-to-back league titles. In his debut season with Los Blancos, he made 37 appearances across all competitions, including 22 in La Liga, scoring seven goals. However, the current season has seen a dramatic reduction in playing time under Alonso. Since recovering from a hamstring injury that sidelined him for several months, Endrick featured just three times across all competitions for a total of just over 100 minutes in La Liga and Champions League, without scoring. 

The fierce competition for places with star forwards Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Jr. has meant opportunities were scarce, with the manager often preferring Gonzalo Garcia as a back-up striker. This lack of involvement caused visible frustration for the young star, who ultimately made the decision to seek a loan move for the sake of his development, something his boss understands. 

Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Alonso said: ""Endrick, at this stage of his career, after coming from Brazil to Europe, needs playing time, and I understand why he made that decision and why the club wanted to invest in his development and experience in a competitive league like the French one, at a club where he'll get more minutes. If that allows him to grow as a player... Real Madrid does a great job with players who develop at other clubs and then perform well for the first team. We've seen it, and if that happens, I understand why Bobby and the club made that decision, and we'll be following him very closely, eager for him to progress and improve.

""We shouldn't just focus on the short term, but also look at the medium term and when the talks are taking place. The decision has been made and there's no going back. Endrick is there, we're following him very closely, and we'll approach the Super Cup with great confidence in the players we have.""

Endrick has earned 14 caps and scored three goals for the senior Brazil national team, but recently expressed a genuine ""fear"" of missing out on the tournament if he remained on the bench at Real. In an interview with Brazil legend Romario, the 19-year-old sensation said: ""To be honest, what goes through my head a lot is that I'm afraid I won't be in the 2026 World Cup. Of course it's difficult, being in the biggest club in the world, with the best players and not having the opportunity to always play. But whenever I play, I can show a bit of my game to be in the national team. I hope that next year I can be in the national team and, God willing, we will win the World Cup.""

Endrick's move to Lyon, where he is expected to play a prominent role, is designed to be a temporary but vital chapter in his career. He has reportedly told everyone at Real Madrid that he will return and succeed at the club, viewing his story in Spain as far from over.

Endrick has made an immediate off-field impact since joining, breaking the club's social media records for his announcement video. Coach Paulo Fonseca has confirmed his new signing is adapting well in training and is highly motivated, though his debut was delayed due to a registration issue and wasn't named in the squad to face Monaco, and is now expected against Lille in the French Cup on January 11. 

Fonseca explained: ""I think he is very good. He started training this week, the adaptation is going very well. He is a player we need, he is different. The whole group welcomed him. I spoke with him, he is very satisfied and we are also pleased to have him with us, with his quality. He is in good physical shape, he worked in Madrid but he is not ready to play 90 minutes. He has had a good training session, he is motivated.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Philadelphia 76ers head to Madison Square Garden to face the New York Knicks, with the Knicks expected to be modest home favorites.

New York has been strong at home behind Jalen Brunson's steady scoring and late-game control, while the 76ers continue to lean heavily on Tyrese Maxey's shot creation and pace, especially if Joel Embiid's status is managed or limited. From a betting angle, Brunson over 28.5 points is a popular prop against a Philly defense that can struggle at the point of attack, while Maxey over 26.5 points and over 6.5 assists draw interest given his expanded role.

On the glass, Josh Hart over 8.5 rebounds is worth a look due to his minutes and hustle, while Embiid (if active) over 10.5 rebounds would be firmly in play. The Knicks' consistency and depth make them a lean on the spread and moneyline, but if Philadelphia pushes tempo, the over 229.5 offers value in what profiles as a high-scoring Eastern Conference showdown.

The line opened with Seattle as a slight favorite with the moneyline near Seahawks -120 / 49ers to +110 and the spread around Seahawks -1.5 to 49ers +1.5, indicating a tight divisional battle with massive playoff seeding implications.

Key player props to consider include Jaxon Smith‑Njigba Over receiving yards given his elite recent form and favorable matchups, and Brock Purdy Over 1.5 passing touchdowns if weapons like Christian McCaffrey and George Kittle suit up; conversely, Sam Darnold Under 1.5 passing TDs is plausible given Seattle's defense and conservative offensive scripts.

Trend angles: Seattle's strong road success and stout defense make them a playable spread lean, while San Francisco's home field and offensive balance give value on the home moneyline or plus‑spread, and the total around 49.5 offers a spot to choose under in a physical NFC West tilt.

Pittsburgh enters with a capable offense and one of the league's top power plays, but they've been inconsistent and have split recent results, whereas Detroit has been strong in recent form and has beaten Pittsburgh in previous meetings.

For props, consider total goals Over 6.5 if you're expecting a back‑and‑forth game; these teams combine for over that mark on plenty of occasions.

On the moneyline and spread, Detroit +1.5 offers value if you think the home club keeps this tight, while the Penguins ML is best if you trust Pittsburgh's attack to outscore Detroit outright.

Check out our soccer expert's Bournemouth vs Arsenal predictions, prior to Saturday's 12:30pm ET Premier League clash (1/3).

AFC Bournemouth have dropped near the bottom of the EPL table after a promising start to the season. Can they withstand a visit from Arsenal?

All odds are courtesy of US Sportsbooks, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change.

Arsenal have scored first and led at half time in five of their last seven meetings with Bournemouth. Furthermore, the Gunners have netted first in five consecutive Premier League matches during the 2025/26 season.

Therefore, the Gunners are likely to open the scoring in the first half on Saturday evening. The betting markets suggest a 41.67% probability that Arsenal will lead at the halftime interval and eventually win the match.

The absence of Antoine Semenyo is expected to reduce Bournemouth's offensive threat significantly. Semenyo has registered 12 goal contributions in 17 EPL appearances so far this season. This form appears to have led to the Ghanaian's transfer to the Etihad Stadium, which will happen as soon as the January transfer window opens.

Six of the last seven meetings between Bournemouth and Arsenal have featured three or more goals. Additionally, both teams have scored in five of Bournemouth's last seven EPL matches.

Historically, 67% of the 18 head-to-head meetings between these clubs have produced over 2.5 goals. Currently, betting markets estimate a 58.82% chance of this happening again on Saturday.

Given Bournemouth's open style and Arsenal's fluidity, this is the value bet from this trio of Bournemouth vs Arsenal predictions for Saturday evening.

Goal distribution data reveals an interesting pattern for both teams. Bournemouth have scored 15 of their 27 home goals in the second half of matches. Conversely, Arsenal have conceded seven of their 11 away goals during the final 45 minutes.

The betting markets indicate a 50% probability that the second half of this match will feature more goals than the first. The statistics suggest that both sides have performed better in the second half of matches in 25/26.

The hosts have been in poor form since late October. Before their match against Chelsea on December 30, the Cherries were winless in nine consecutive games. Their defensive performance has been a primary concern, with the team conceding between two and three goals in several recent away fixtures.

Bournemouth are expected to be without the services of Antoine Semenyo for this encounter. Semenyo is reportedly joining Manchester City, who intend to activate his £65 million release clause. Therefore, Iraola will likely rely on Evanilson to lead the line, supported by the likes of Kluivert and Kroupi from the bench.

Arsenal are under pressure as Manchester City and Aston Villa remain close in the standings. However, Mikel Arteta's squad has shown resilience. Following a defeat to Villa, they secured several consecutive victories leading up to their home match against the same opponents on December 30.

Despite defensive injury concerns, the Gunners continue to achieve positive results. Declan Rice had to play as a makeshift right back for their 2-1 win at Brighton. One positive is that Gabriel Magalhaes is close to returning to the starting XI after an injury lay-off.

AFC Bournemouth expected lineup: Petrovic, Truffert, Smith, Diakite, Senesi, Cook, Scott, Jimenez, Tavernier, Kluivert, Evanilson

Arsenal expected lineup: Raya, Lewis-Skelly, Gabriel, Saliba, Rice, Merino, Zubimendi, Odegaard, Saka, Eze, Gyokeres","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Gauff does double duty to seal opening victory for United States","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/united-states-argentina-united-cup-2026-saturday","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 14:26:15 GMT","

Coco Gauff did double duty for the United States on Saturday at the United Cup, where she teamed with Christian Harrison to help earn the defending champion a 2-1 win against Argentina in Group A.

Sebastian Baez had given Argentina a surprise lead in the tie when he upset World No. 6 Taylor Fritz for his second Top 10 win. However, Gauff ensured the United States made a winning start to its campaign at the mixed-teams event in Perth, defeating Solana Sierra and then joining forces with Harrison to clinch a decisive 6-4, 6-1 victory against Maria Lourdes Carle and Guido Andreozzi.

In an impressive doubles display, Gauff and Harrison dictated for large periods. They dominated the baseline exchanges and were sharper around the net to prevail after 63 minutes. The United States is now 1-0 in Group A and will next play Spain.



Gauff's meeting with Sierra was the first encounter between the two on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, and Sierra's first-ever top 10 matchup in her career. 

 “I feel like I can play even better too, which is even more exciting,” Gauff said on-court after the match. “It's always tough starting the first match of the season, especially against an opponent like her and someone who played yesterday. I'm really happy with how I managed all those emotions.” 

With a pair of break points and three holds of serve, Gauff sprinted out to a 5-0 lead, and she saved two break-point opportunities of Sierra's. The Argentinian No. 1 did get on the board, much to the delight of the Perth crowd, with a hold of serve in the sixth game. 

After two double faults, Gauff regrouped and won four consecutive points to take the first set in just a half hour, which she limited Sierra to just seven points on her serve. 

The second set would be a replica that saw Gauff, who went undefeated in singles at last year's United Cup, win 6-1 and secure the double breadstick victory. 

A win for Argentina in mixed doubles guarantees a first-place finish in Group A and their first quarterfinal in three tries at the event following their win over Spain Friday. 

Earlier, Baez upset World No. 6 Fritz 4-6, 7-5, 6-4.

The 25-year-old defeated Spain's Jaume Munar in his opening match at the mixed-teams event on Friday and backed that up with one of the best performances of his career against Fritz, who showed signs of rustiness throughout the two hours and 35-minute clash.

 “I am so happy right now,” Baez said. “We have been searching for this feeling for many years and I am happy to give this point to Argentina. Thank you to the crowd. I felt very comfortable today.”

Baez had lost his previous five Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings against Fritz but rallied from a set and a break down to give Argentina a 1-0 lead. The No. 45 player in the PIF ATP Live Rankings crucially saved a break point when serving for the match at 5-4 in the third set, sealing victory with a simple volley into the open court. Argentina defeated Spain 3-0 in its opening Group A tie.

 Two years is a long time in tennis, as Flavio Cobolli can testify. 

 At the 2024 Australian Open, the Italian arrived as an unheralded World No. 100 who was bidding to qualify for the main draw at a major for the first time. Cobolli did just that at Melbourne Park, before defeating Nicolas Jarry in a five-set epic to earn his maiden main draw Grand Slam triumph. It is a moment he returns to again and again. 

 “When I have time, I watch that match,” Cobolli told ATPTour.com in Perth, where he is preparing to compete on Australian soil once again, this time as the World No. 22 and a two-time ATP Tour champion at the United Cup. “I played great tennis in qualies, but I was new on the Tour. I played against Nico [Jarry] and there was a big crowd for him, not for me. 

 “It was tight. No one knew me there and I played like a new guy on the Tour, but when I remember that moment, I remember a guy that was happy on the court. Like I am now. So I'm trying to keep this feeling in the ‘new' part of my career also.” 

 The ‘new' part of his career that Cobolli refers to has seen him emerge as a consistent Top 30 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. The Italian even broke the Top 20 for a three-week stint last July and August after reaching his maiden major quarter-final at Wimbledon. 

 “It was only two years ago, but I feel I am now on the Tour like I wanted,” said Cobolli, comparing the video of him taking on Jarry in Melbourne to his current feeling. “When I look back, it's always great to remember these things and I don't want to forget where I've come from. 

 “When I watch [the video], I think what a kid I was. When I watch my matches now and I see where I am, I feel like I'm very different from two years ago.” 



 In 2025, Cobolli racked up a 34-27 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and lifted his first two ATP Tour crowns (both on clay) in Bucharest and Hamburg, respectively. That return represented a significant turnaround for the Italian, who won his first two matches of the year at the United Cup but by late March was 2-8 at tour-level as he struggled for form and fitness. 

 “I know that 2025 was a great year, but it didn't start how I wanted because [after the United Cup] I didn't win a match until the first title in Bucharest,” said Cobolli, who this year will spearhead Team Italy's group-stage bid alongside WTA No. 8 Jasmine Paolini. “The goal for this year is to be ready to start the season like I want, because last year I was injured also. This year I'm ready and in shape. We have practised a lot, and we are ready to start. 

 “The goal for me is to be ready for the first match of the year. I love to play in this competition and play with Jas and the other players in the team. I think we can have a great competition here.”

 Cobolli and his team focused on several areas of his game in the offseason in the hope he can push past his career high of World No. 17 this year. 
 “We worked a lot on the return, because we haven't worked a lot on it as my return has always been very good,” explained the 23-year-old. “But with this level, with these guys that serve as they do, it's a thing you have to improve a lot. Also my serve and my volley game. These are the three things that I worked on a lot. 
 “The percentage of my serve [will be important] for sure, and my game when I attack. My volley is not the best shot that I have. The way I finish volleys is going to be a goal for this year.” 
 Cobolli hopes to use the relative stability he has found inside the Top 30 over the past seven months to play a lighter schedule with an emphasis on the Tour's biggest events. With improved results at the majors and the ATP Masters 1000s, he believes he can make it to his next rankings goal. 
 “The goal for this year is to improve and to play a little bit less than last year for sure,” he said ahead of his opening singles match against Stan Wawrinka in Perth. “To be part of the big stages as much as I can. The dream is to be Top 10, but it's tough and I know there are many players that are working for that also. So it's going to be tough, but when I think about myself and my team, we will see what happens. For sure it's going to be a great year.”

Australia survived a stern test into the early hours of Sunday morning at the United Cup.

Storm Hunter and John-Patrick Smith rallied past Viktor Durasovic and Ulrikke Eikeri 4-6, 6-1, 10-4 in a deciding mixed doubles to secure Australia's 2-1 triumph against Norway.

“I'll tell you what, Storm set it up big time there… I was just on the court, I was participating,” Smith said. “She was returning well, she was moving well. She had really good control on all her shots. It was a great win and a great comeback as well. It's never easy playing against a good team.""

Hunter had started the night on a positive note for the home country, stepping in for an ill Maya Joint to defeat Malene Helgo in singles. She then returned to the court for the critical doubles alongside United Cup debutant Smith.

In the first set, the Norwegians swung freely to put pressure on the Australians. But Hunter and Smith started well in the second set and never looked back.

“I think we just became a bit more aggressive and just wanted to play on our terms and brought the energy a little bit more,” Hunter said. “We went after it and in mixed doubles anything can happen. We had a few chances in the first set, didn't quite get them, so in the second we were able to convert them.”

Casper Ruud made a big statement in the second match of the tie when he cruised past home star Alex de Minaur 6-3, 6-3 in one hour and 34 minutes to level the tie.

“I'm happy to get a great start,"" Ruud told ATP No. 1 Club member Jim Courier in his on-court interview. ""To beat Alex here in Australia is one of the toughest challenges we have in tennis, so I'm super happy to have that on my resume now.”

Ruud played aggressively and decisively, preventing De Minaur from finding any rhythm. The former No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings saved all five break points he faced and consistently put pressure on the Australian's serve, earning 10 break chances and converting three.

""It's a great start a new season,"" Ruud said. ""I think we've all seen Alex in better shape than he was today. He was doing a few unforced errors that typically he doesn't, so I got some free points here and there. You saw in the beginning he was struggling with his serve, so I got a free break and just built from there.""

Hunter, 31, returned to competition last season after missing nearly a year between March 2024 and March 2025 because of an Achilles tendon injury that required surgery. She stepped in as a last-minute replacement on Saturday for Australia No. 1 Joint, who was sidelined because of illness.

The experienced left hander made a fast start against the 26-year-old Helgo, who is competing in the United Cup for the fourth time. Hunter broke serve twice in the opening set to take it 6-2.

Helgo, ranked No. 532 and seeking her first WTA Tour victory, raced to a 4-1 lead in the second set before Hunter — a former world No. 1 doubles player and a Grand Slam mixed doubles champion — rallied to level the set at 5-5.

Helgo saved three break points in a crucial 11th game to hold for a 6-5 lead, but Hunter held serve to force a tie-break. The Australian then dominated the tie-break to seal a 6-2, 7-6(3) victory.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Triple Z's double victory: Zhang does double duty to lead China past Belgium at United Cup","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/belgium-china-united-cup-2026-saturday","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 07:41:15 GMT","

Triple Z earned double the wins to propel China past Belgium 2-1 Saturday at the United Cup.

After Zhang Zhizhen survived a thrilling singles match against Zizou Bergs, Zhang partnered Zhu Lin past Bergs and Elise Mertens 5-7, 7-6(5), 10-6 in the deciding mixed doubles inside Ken Rosewall Arena.

""In doubles we just needed to win a set plus a super tie-break ,"" Zhang said. ""We just really [used] the first set to try to play more and to try more things in the service games and then to be prepared for the second set and hopefully the third set.""

China let slip a 5-1 lead in the second set and Belgium was within two points of clinching the tie twice — at 6-5 30/30 in the second set and then at 5/5 in the second-set tie-break.

Zhang dominated play in many of the key moments, but in the critical 5/5 point, Zhu showed great defensive volleys to avoid giving Belgium match point. They then surged to the lead in the Match Tie-break and were able to close out the clash after captain Wu Di called timeout at 9/6 before Zhang's final serve.

""It was the first time we've played mixed doubles together and thank you to Triple Z, I got a good partner today,"" Lin said. ""He just played a three-hour match and then continued to play mixed doubles with me. It wasn't easy. It was a great performance today and thank you for all the crowd and for the support, it really means a lot to us."" 

Zhang battled past Bergs 6-7(2), 7-6(3), 7-5 in two hours and 53 minutes to level the tie and keep his country's hopes alive.

“I think he was serving really well and then I didn't have a chance,” Zhang said in his on-court interview. “Second serves he was making 180 kilometres [an hour], which I couldn't react to that fast. But I'm super happy that I was surviving [for the] team until the end. I didn't give up and kept the same patience. We were both playing a really good match today.”





There was not a service break in the match until 5-5 in the deciding set, when Bergs missed an inside-out forehand to allow Zhang to serve out the match.

The Chinese star, who missed six months last season due to a shoulder injury, hit 12 aces and did not face a break point to survive Bergs' 18-ace barrage. Zhang, the former No. 31 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, earned 10 break points in the match and finally converted nearly three hours into the showdown.



Mertens got Belgium off to a strong start on the first day of play in Sydney by beating China's Zhu 6-2, 6-2 in Group B action.

The top-ranked player from her country on the WTA Tour, Mertens kicked off her 12th WTA tour-level season in style with a one-hour, 18-minute victory — her fourth in five career meetings with former World No. 31 Zhu. 

The 31-year-old from China had a resurgent second half of 2025 after seeing her position in the PIF WTA Rankings plummet due to an elbow injury. Ranked No. 493 in August, she reached the fourth round of the WTA 1000 event in Montreal, and begins 2026 ranked No. 168. But, on the whole, Mertens proved too much for the Chinese No. 6 to handle.

She broke serve six times in victory, won five of the first six games, and four straight from 1-1 in the second set, even though she landed less than than 50 per cent of first serves in set two.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Wawrinka stands tall in United Cup classic to seal Perth victory for Switzerland","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/switzerland-france-united-cup-2026-saturday","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 10:07:30 GMT","

 Stan Wawrinka made a winning start to his final year on the ATP Tour in dramatic circumstances on Saturday in Perth. 

 With his 5-7, 7-6(5), 7-6(5) victory against Arthur Rinderknech, Wawrinka sealed victory for Switzerland in its United Cup opener with France. Belinda Benic had earlier eased past Leolia Jeanjean 6-2, 6-4 to give her team the perfect start to the Group C encounter, and she later returned for a mixed doubles win alongside Jakub Paul to complete a 3-0 clean sweep for the Swiss. 

 ""It's amazing to start the year like this for me,"" said Wawrinka, who announced in December that 2026 would be his final season as a pro, after his three-hour, 18-minute triumph at RAC Arena. ""It's my first time in Perth. A lot of support today, so it was an amazing feeling to play such a difficult match A tough condition, of course. More than three hours, so doesn't help, but super happy with the fight, with the performance, and to help the Swiss team to get to 2-0 up.""

 Rinderknech and Wawrinka's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting was hard-fought throughout. Rinderknech held serve from 0/40 at 4-4 before going on to clinch the opening set with a break in the 12th game, before Wawrinka stayed ice cool to take the second in a tie-break. The trademark backhand down-the-line winner he produced to seal the set had the Perth crowd on its feet as the match moved into a decider. 

 After an early exchange of breaks in the third set, Wawrinka claimed his first win against a Top 50 opponent on hard courts since 2024 by edging Rinderknech in a deciding tie-break. 

 The No. 29 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Rinderknech is aiming to build on a career-best 2025 season. He notched 27 tour-level victories, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, a tally which includes his run to the final at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Yet he was unable to find the consistency in his big-serving game to overcome former World No. 3 Wawrinka, who has now recorded an ATP Tour win in 23 different seasons (2003, 2005-25). 



Prior to Wawrinka's win, Switzerland couldn't have asked for a much better start to its United Cup campaign than the one Bencic delivered. The 28-year-old dropped the opening game against France's Leolia Jeanjean, but never trailed again, rolling to a 6-2, 6-4 win at RAC Arena in 1 hour and 31 minutes. 

Bencic controlled the matchup from the outset in the pair's first meeting, dominating at the net, where she won 23 of 29 points, and reinforcing that edge with strong serving. She won 78 per cent of her first-serve points to stifle most of the pressure Jeanjean managed to generate, and sealed the victory with a backhand winner down the line. 

“The last game was tricky with the Australian sun,” Bencic said after the match. “I think this is really one of the only places — to play in Australia — where you get into this situation. So I should have done better somehow. So I'm gonna find some solutions next time.”

Bencic is coming off a resurgent 2025 season in which she was named WTA Comeback Player of the Year, climbing from World No. 421 in January to No. 11 in the year-end rankings in her first full season after maternity leave.

“Last year, we didn't expect it to go so well,” Bencic said. “Of course, I don't think the work is done yet. I'm extremely happy to receive the Comeback Player of the Year award, and now it's time to do more work and try to get better.”

 Bencic returned to court after Wawrinka's epic triumph to team with Paul for a 6-2, 5-7, 10-2 mixed doubles triumph against Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah and Edouard Roger-Vasselin. Switzerland will aim to back up its 3-0 opening win by downing Italy on Sunday in Perth.

 Arthur Fils will not compete in January while he continues his recovery from a back injury. 

 The Frenchman confirmed on his YouTube channel that he has withdrawn from Hong Kong, Adelaide and the Australian Open. The stress fracture first forced him to withdraw from a tournament before his third-round match at Roland Garros last May. 



 Fils made an initial comeback in August at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers in Toronto, but that proved to be his final event of the 2025 season after he felt ‘a warning sign' in his back in Canada. 

 A three-time ATP Tour titlist, the 21-year-old Fils is the current No. 39 in the PIF ATP Rankings. He reached his career high of No. 14 last April.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Zhang Zhizhen's path back from a shoulder injury & completely changing his forehand","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/zhang-united-cup-2025-feature","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 01:26:07 GMT","

A Chinese history maker is back at the United Cup.

The first Chinese man to crack the Top 100 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Zhang Zhizhen, is again representing his country on the global stage at the United Cup. But this edition is different for the 29-year-old righty.

Zhang is No. 410 in the world after an injury-mired 2025 season during which he struggled with a shoulder injury, which dates back to when he was 15.

“I do believe sometimes during the years, a few days, I felt the shoulder was painful, but I thought the problem was gone,” Zhang told ATPTour.com. “It seemed like that last year, I felt maybe in two weeks the problem will be gone. But it was still there and we did an MRI with an injection to see the problem.”

The former World No. 31 began feeling pain in the front of his shoulder in February when he competed in Doha and Dubai. It began to subside and then became a bigger issue the following month when he traveled to the United States for the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.

The imaging showed that his injury was actually inside the shoulder and closer to the back of it rather than in the front. He would not play a competitive match for more than six months.

The next two months, Zhang did not play tennis at all. Instead, the Chinese standout did fitness every day, played on his computer and spent time with family.

“But most of the time I was running,” Zhang said with a smile.

“In those moments sometimes I was missing a bit to play tennis. I knew when the tennis would start it would get a little bit easier. To do the fitness part, the exercises, only one session of the fitness part was really tough. So I wish I had some tennis, but I could not in that moment.”





The only time Zhang left Shanghai during the period was in late April to attend the Laureus World Sports Awards in Madrid. The bulk of his time was spent staying in shape, improving his conditioning and biding his time.

Zhang began playing tennis lightly in July and did not feel too comfortable on the court when he began.

“But at least I was moving all the time on the tennis court, so I didn't really forget about the court size,” Zhang said. “It was still okay. But to play rallies was a little bit different.”

What he was able to do was change his game. Zhang believes that his forehand swing path was what caused his injury, so the time away allowed him to totally alter his swing.

“This forehand, I wanted to change already. It was even a better moment to change completely,” Zhang said. “Without this shoulder injury, I think we wouldn't change that and make such a big difference. We would do smaller changes to help, but now we changed everything.

“Preparation, using the power, how to transfer the power and a little bit the motion of the swing, which is everything. To be more natural and more like everyone.”

Zhang, who returned for three tournaments in China in September, will try to show the progress he has made at the United Cup. China takes on Belgium Saturday in Sydney.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Medvedev, Musetti learn Brisbane & Hong Kong paths","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/brisbane-hong-kong-2026-draw","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 09:42:13 GMT","

Daniil Medvedev, Tommy Paul and Joao Fonseca are among the stars set to kick off the 2026 season this coming week at the Brisbane International presented by ANZ, where the draw was made on Saturday.

Top seed Medvedev is competing in Brisbane for the first time since he reached the final in 2019 and will face Marton Fucsovics in his opener. The winner will meet Frances Tiafoe or Australian wild card Aleksandar Vukic.

Paul has not competed since the US Open due to a foot injury but will make his return to action against big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. Paul is in the same half as second seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who begins against Brandon Nakashima.

Davidovich Fokina is the only player inside the Top 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings without a tour-level title, having reached four finals last season. He will try to change that record at the ATP 250.



Joao Fonseca starts his season at a career-high No. 24 and will play American Reilly Opelka in the first round. Opelka advanced to the final in Brisbane last year, losing to defending champion Jiri Lehecka. Third seed Lehecka starts his title defence against Tomas Machac.

The Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Learner Tien will look to continue his impressive form when he faces Camilo Ugo Carabelli in the first round. The 20-year-old American could play good friend Alex Michelsen in the second round. Grigor Dimitrov returned to Tour in Paris in November and will continue his comeback in Brisbane, where he plays a qualifier in the first round.

At the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open, Lorenzo Musetti is the top seed and meets Tomas Martin Etcheverry or Valentin Royer in the second round following Saturday's draw. The World No. 8 is making his third consecutive appearance at the ATP 250.

Second seed Alexander Bublik will take on Botic van de Zandschulp or a qualifier, while 2024 champion Andrey Rublev will face Wu Yibing or Fabian Marozsan. #NextGenATP star Rei Sakamoto takes on fifth seed Lorenzo Sonego, with 20-year-old Chinese lefty Shang Juncheng playing Francisco Comesana. Home favourite Coleman Wong meets Mariano Navone.

Shang reached the semi-finals in Hong Kong last season before injuries derailed his year. Wong's best result in 2025 came at the US Open, where he advanced to the third round.

After Sebastian Baez upset Taylor Fritz to pull Argentina level, Coco Gauff led the United States to a 2–1 win by defeating Solana Sierra in singles and then partnering Christian Harrison to secure the decisive mixed-doubles point.

PERTH, Australia -- World No. 3 Coco Gauff went straight to business in her 2026 season debut at the United Cup, helping the defending champion United States earn a 2-1 win over Argentina in Group A on Saturday.

Argentina struck first when Sebastian Baez delivered one of the best performances of his career, upsetting World No. 6 Taylor Fritz 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 to open the night session and give Argentina a 1-0 lead.

Gauff responded by defeating rising star and No. 66 Solana Sierra 6-1, 6-1 in 57 minutes to level the tie at 1-1. That result sent the tie to a deciding mixed-doubles match.

Gauff then teamed with Christian Harrison to close out the match, earning a 6-4, 6-1 win over Maria Lourdes Carle and Guido Andreozzi. They controlled the match from the baseline, were assertive at the net and wrapped up the victory in 63 minutes, giving the United States a 2-1 win. The U.S. is now 1-0 in Group A and will next face Spain.

""It was fun, I've watched Coco play so much and I'm such a big fan,"" said Harrison, who said he was playing for his country for the first time. ""It's just fun to share a match like that with these guys, some people that I look up to, and it's good to just get out there and enjoy playing hard.""

Argentina's quarterfinal fate will be determined by its showdown against Spain. Gauff is scheduled to face Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro on Jan. 5.

It was the first encounter between Gauff and Sierra on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, and Sierra's first career Top 10 matchup.

“I feel like I can play even better, too, which is even more exciting,” Gauff said on court after the match. “It's always tough starting the first match of the season, especially against an opponent like her and someone who played yesterday. I'm really happy with how I managed all those emotions.”

Gauff raced to a 5-0 lead behind a pair of breaks and three strong service holds, saving two break points along the way. Sierra earned a loud response from the Perth crowd when she held in the sixth game, before Gauff closed the set in 30 minutes while limiting Sierra to just seven points on serve.

The second set followed the same pattern. Gauff, who went undefeated in singles at last year's United Cup, closed out another 6-1 set to complete the win.

""I definitely think there's things I can do better from being hyper critical, but it's a straightforward win,"" Gauff said to reporters. ""I think as the more the season goes, I feel like that stuff will settle in even more.""

Baez, meanwhile, earned his second career Top 10 victory and his first win over Fritz after five previous losses. The No. 45 player in the PIF ATP Live Rankings rallied from a set and a break down and saved a break point while serving for the match at 5-4 in the third set before sealing victory with a volley into the open court.

""I am so happy right now,"" Baez said on court. ""We have been searching for this feeling for many years, and I am happy to give this point to Argentina. Thank you to the crowd. I felt very comfortable today.""

Baez had defeated Spain's Jaume Munar in his opening match Friday. Argentina defeated Spain 3-0 in its first Group A tie.

From Iga Swiatek's personal mindset to high praise for 2025 breakout star Victoria Mboko and Barbora Krejcikova's pride to represent Czechia, here is all the latest news from the second Media Day at the United Cup in Sydney.

Iga Swiatek made it clear she isn't going to add any additional pressure on herself ahead of the 2026 season. 

The Polish national sits No. 2 in the PIF WTA Rankings, behind World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka. With four Roland Garros titles and one at both Wimbledon and the US Open, she just needs a win at the Australian Open to complete the career Slam.

However, chasing the No. 1 ranking and achieving the career Slam aren't immediate priorities for the 24-year-old. 

""I'm just focusing on my own process,"" Swiatek said. ""Both of these things are hard to achieve and are a big goal. There is a long way to get there. On a Grand Slam you have to really play great for two weeks, not have any bad days, be consistent.

""Achieving No. 1 also is tough, especially when Aryna has been playing great for last years. I'll just focus on myself honestly, because that's the only way to go. I don't need to choose which one is more important, which one is a priority. I'm still young. I have plenty of time to do different things and achieve different goals in my career.""

The six-time Grand Slam champion with 25 WTA titles has learned the importance of focusing on the current tournament. She doesn't want to get too far ahead of herself, a lesson she said she learned in 2023. 

""I think my mentality at the beginning of the year is usually pretty much the same,"" Swiatek said. ""The only difference was maybe 2023 when I did the mistakes of thinking about the whole season already at the beginning. It totally didn't make sense.

""Now I'm really thinking about it as last year, as in 2024, just thinking about one swing, only tournaments in Australia. Then after I'm done with that, I'll think about the next one.""

Swiatek's current focus is the United Cup, where she guided Poland to the final last season, before the team fell to the United States. It's a tournament she prefers nowadays as her tuneup into the Australian Open given the unique format, opposed to tournaments like Brisbane and Adelaide. 

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

""Playing United Cup, I will always want to because the atmosphere is so much different. We get so many, like, normal tournaments on tour that honestly it gets boring sometimes,"" said Swiatek, who will face Germany's Eva Lys and Netherlands' Suzan Lamens in Group F.

""Playing a team event and having the different energy, being able to have a team and talk to different people than we do on tour, I think it's great. It's really refreshing. I will always choose [the] United Cup.""

Canada's Victoria Mboko will make her United Cup debut, and is in charge of women's singles responsibilities in her Group B matches against Belgium's Elise Mertens and China's Zhu Lin.

Mboko returns to the court after a breakout 2025 season that saw the teenager climbed from outside the top 300 to No. 18 in the world. The pinnacle of her season came in her own country, when she defeated Naomi Osaka at the National Bank Open final for her first WTA 1000 title. 

She received high praise from her male counterpart, Felix Auger-Aliassime, who is ranked fifth in world in the ATP PIF Rankings. In Sydney, it'll potentially be the first time the Canadian stars share the court, if selected for the mixed-doubles match.

""Vicky had a breakthrough year last year. Amazing year. It was so much fun to watch,"" Auger-Aliassime said. ""I think myself and teammates and all of Canada was really proud of her. I'm looking forward to it.

""It would be our first time being on the same team, playing together mixed. I've had my share of experience, so hopefully I can help a little bit. She's got all the qualities we need on the court to go all the way and win.""

Mboko said she's excited about the possibility of playing alongside one of the world's best, who reached the semifinals in men's singles at the 2025 US Open. Furthermore, she has enjoyed competing Canada's Billie Jean King Cup team previously, which helped her decision to play at the United Cup.

""This is just a different format that I'm not really used to,"" Mboko said. ""It's a great way to start the year playing round-robin matches and then maybe eventually advancing to the final group stages. The whole format of everything was drawing me to play this tournament. I'm happy with my decision.""

Barbora Krejcikova is one of many players making their debut at the tournament, but to the Czechia native, the United Cup was an event she couldn't refuse.

Krejcikova, ranked No. 65, is ranked lower than compatriots such as Karolina Muchova and Marketa Vondrousova, but they elected to begin their years in Brisbane, paving the way for the two-time Grand Slam champion to represent her country.

""When I got this opportunity to be part of the team, to play this competition finally after a couple of years, I was really excited right away,"" Krejcikova said. ""As I already said, I'm really happy that I can be here, that I can represent this team.""

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

Krejcikova is currently scheduled to face Australia's Maya Joint and Norway's Malene Helgo in Group D, though Joint has been battling an illness in recent days.

After returning from injury in the middle of the 2025 season, Krejcikova said she's feeling healthy heading into this season, and improved her ranking with a quarterfinal finish at the US Open. She's also an easy choice for mixed doubles, too, given her seven Grand Slam doubles titles. 

""Regarding the mixed doubles, it's always been great to play mixed,"" Krejcikova said. ""I always enjoyed it very much.""

Belinda Bencic opened the 2026 United Cup for Switzerland with a 6-2, 6-4 win over France's Leolia Jeanjean in 1 hour and 31 minutes at RAC Arena. Followed by Stan Wawrinka's three-set thrilling victory over Arthur Rinderknech and a mixed-doubles win, the Swiss swept the tie in Group C.

Switzerland couldn't have asked for a much better start to its 2026 United Cup campaign than the ones Belinda Bencic and Stan Wawrinka delivered Saturday in Perth.

To cap the strong afternoon, Bencic and Jakub Paul defeated Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah and Edouard Roger-Vasselin in mixed doubles.

United Cup: Scores | Standings

Bencic dropped the opening game against France's Leolia Jeanjean, but never trailed again, rolling to a 6-2, 6-4 win at RAC Arena in 1 hour and 31 minutes. The victory -- sealed with a backhand winner down the line -- gave Switzerland a 1-0 lead in its tie against France prior to the men's singles match between Wawrinka and Arthur Rinderknech.

Bencic controlled the matchup from the outset in the pair's first meeting, dominating at the net, where she won 23 of 29 points, and reinforcing that edge with strong serving. She won 78% of her first-serve points to stifle most of the pressure Jeanjean managed to generate.

""The last game was tricky with the Australian sun,"" Bencic said after the match. ""I think this is really one of the only places -- to play in Australia -- where you get into this situation. So I should have done better somehow. So I'm going to find some solutions next time.""

Bencic, 28, is coming off a resurgent 2025 season in which she was named WTA Comeback Player of the Year, climbing from World No. 421 in January to No. 11 in the year-end rankings in her first full season after maternity leave.

""Last year, we didn't expect it to go so well,"" Bencic said. ""Of course, I don't think the work is done yet. I'm extremely happy to receive the Comeback Player of the Year award, and now it's time to do more work and try to get better.""

Wawrinka made a winning start to his final year on the ATP Tour in dramatic circumstances. Defeating Rinderknech 5-7, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (5), Wawrinka sealed victory for Switzerland in its United Cup opener. 

""Today was a tough battle but I'm very happy I could make it 2-0,"" said Wawrinka, who announced in December that 2026 would be his final season as a pro, after his three-hour, 18-minute triumph at RAC Arena.

After an early exchange of breaks in the third set, Wawrinka claimed his first win against a Top 50 opponent on hard courts since 2024 by edging Rinderknech in a deciding tie-break.

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

The No. 29 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Rinderknech is aiming to build on a career-best 2025 season. He notched 27 tour-level victories, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, a tally which includes his run to the final at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Yet he was unable to find the consistency in his big-serving game to overcome former World No. 3 Wawrinka, who has now recorded an ATP Tour win in 23 different seasons (2003, 2005-25).

Elise Mertens got Belgium off to a strong start on the first day of United Cup play in Sydney on Saturday by beating China's Zhu Lin 6-2, 6-2 in Group B action, but China ultimately prevailed after Zhang Zhizhen's win in men's singles and the country's win in mixed doubles.

Elise Mertens got Belgium off to a strong start on the first day of United Cup play in Sydney on Saturday by beating China's Zhu Lin 6-2, 6-2 in Group B action. However, China ultimately prevailed in the tie following Zhang Zhizhen's win over Zizou Bergs and the country's win in mixed doubles at Ken Rosewall Arena.

The top-ranked player from her country on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, Mertens kicked off her 12th WTA tour-level season in style with a 1-hour and 18-minute victory -- her fourth in five career meetings with former World No. 31 Zhu.

United Cup: Scores | Standings

The 31-year-old from China had a resurgent second half of 2025 after her position in the PIF WTA Rankings plummeted after an elbow injury. Ranked No. 493 in August, Lin reached the fourth round of the WTA 1000 event in Montreal, and begins 2026 ranked No. 168. But, on the whole, Mertens proved too much for the Chinese No. 6 to handle.

She broke serve six times in victory, won five of the first six games, and four straight from 1-1 in the second set -- even though she landed less than than 50% of first serves in the second set.

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

""I'm very happy to be back and to start on a good note,"" Mertens said afterward. ""First match is about getting the balls, getting the mentality and everything, so I'm very happy that I could close out this one.""

In the men's singles, Zhang battled to a 6-7(2), 7-6(3), 7-5 victory against Bergs in 2 hours and 53 minutes to knot things at 1-1.

“I think he was serving really well and then I didn't have a chance,” Zhang said in his on-court interview. “Second serves he was making 180 kilometers [an hour], which I couldn't react to that fast. But I'm super happy that I was surviving [for the] team until the end. I didn't give up and kept the same patience. We were both playing a really good match today.”

There was not a service break in the match until 5-5 in the deciding set, when Bergs missed an inside-out forehand to allow Zhang to serve out the match.

The Chinese star, who missed six months last season due to a shoulder injury, hit 12 aces and did not face a break point to survive Bergs' 18-ace barrage. Zhang, the former No. 31 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, earned 10 break points in the match and finally converted nearly three hours into the showdown to keep his country's hopes in the tie alive.

After Zhang's singles match, he partnered with Zhu Lin and the pair defeated Bergs and Mertens 5-7, 7-6 (5), [10-6] in the deciding mixed doubles.

""In doubles we just needed to win a set plus a super tie-break,"" Zhang said. ""We just really [used] the first set to try to play more and to try more things in the service games and then to be prepared for the second set and hopefully the third set.""

China let slip a 5-1 lead in the second set and Belgium was within two points of clinching the tie twice -- at 6-5, 30-30 in the second set and then at 5-5 in the second-set tie-break.

Zhang dominated play in many of the key moments, but in the critical 5-5 point, Zhu showed great defensive volleys to avoid giving Belgium match point. They then surged to the lead in the 10-point match tie-break and closed out the clash after captain Wu Di called timeout at 9-6 before Zhang's final serve.

""It was the first time we've played mixed doubles together and thank you to Triple Z, I got a good partner today,"" Lin said. ""He just played a three-hour match and then continued to play mixed doubles with me. It wasn't easy. It was a great performance today and thank you for all the crowd and for the support, it really means a lot to us."" 

Elise Mertens got Belgium off to a strong start on the first day of United Cup play in Sydney on Saturday by beating China's Zhu Lin 6-2, 6-2 in Group B action, but China ultimately prevailed after Zhang Zhizhen's win in men's singles and the country's win in mixed doubles.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Seven of the Top 10 are in Brisbane, with World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka possibly headed for a rematch with Madison Keys. On the other side, Amanda Anisimova could meet Mirra Andreeva for a semifinal berth.

The Brisbane International is loaded. 

Seven of the top 10 players in the world headline the 48-player field, including last year's US Open finalists, the reigning WTA Finals champion and last year's Australian Open champion.

The leadup to the Australian Open will provide a strong indication of who's in form early in the season, and the depth of the field guarantees that there will be more than a few classic matches between some of the world's best.

Here's a breakdown of each quarter, the key first-round matches to watch and the potential quarterfinal matchups.

2026 Brisbane International: See the full draw

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, the defending champion, is the obvious frontrunner in this section. She dropped just one set in Brisbane last year (in the final), and she'll be the favorite to win it all again in 2026. The other Top 10 player in this section is Madison Keys. All she did in Australia last year was go 12-0 en route to her first career major title. (She opted to play in Adelaide instead of Brisbane, winning the title there.) Will she find another spark in Australia this year?

Sorana Cirstea vs. Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova: This is a fun one between veterans, one of whom -- the 35-year-old Cirstea -- is set to retire from the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz at the end of the year. Here's a stat: Their first career match was in 2008. Cirstea won that one, on clay in Morocco, and they've split six matches in the 18 (!) years since.

Aryna Sabalenka [1] vs. Madison Keys [5]: Can't get much better than this in one of the first tournaments of the year. You might recall that they played in last year's Australian Open final, a Keys victory that was one of the best matches of 2025 (and without question the biggest win of the American's career).

No one ended 2025 hotter than Elena Rybakina, and it wasn't close. The World No. 5 won six consecutive matches to qualify for the WTA Finals, and then won five straight in Riyadh to claim the biggest prize in the history of women's sports. She'll look to keep the momentum going in a section that includes Karolina Muchova, Paula Badosa -- starting fresh after an injury-plagued season -- and newly-minted Top 10 player Ekaterina Alexandrova.

Jaqueline Cristian vs. Marie Bouzkova: Of the four matches they've played, three have gone to deciders. And four of the 11 sets have gone to tiebreakers. Expect another close one this time around.

Elena Rybakina [3] vs. Ekaterina Alexandrova [7]: Will Rybakina look as unstoppable as she did at the end of the season? How will Alexandrova come out of the gate as a first-time Top 10 player? Adding to the intrigue is the fact that they've split their six career meetings. Rybakina won their two matches in 2025, in Ningbo and Riyadh.

Jessica Pegula, playing Brisbane for the first time, headlines the third quarter, and she could play former US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez in the third round. Also in this section are Top 20 players Clara Tauson and Liudmila Samsonova.

Tatjana Maria vs. Emerson Jones (WC): Oh, what a treat. The 38-year-old, half a year removed from winning her first career WTA 500 title, against the 17-year-old Australian hopeful who many are predicting will be the country's next breakout star. We know who the fans will be behind in this one.

Clara Tauson [8] vs. Jessica Pegula [4]: This would be the first career meeting between Pegula and Tauson.

A post shared by Brisbane International (@brisbaneinternational)

Amanda Anisimova, coming off the season of her career, is the top seed in what might be the most competitive and daunting -- and perhaps most interesting -- section of the draw. Fellow Top 10 player Mirra Andreeva is also in this quarter, as is World No. 13 Linda Noskova and the always dangerous Marta Kostyuk. (And Marketa Vondrousova, former Wimbledon champion, is no slouch.) In a year where Anisimova has been predicted by many (myself included) to win a major, she'll be tested right out of the gate.

Marketa Vondrousova vs. Magdalena Frech: Vondrousova rolled to the US Open quarterfinals last year, but was forced to retire from her match against Sabalenka with a knee injury. She returned to play two more matches in 2025, both losses. (The second one was a second-set retirement.) We'll find out soon enough if she's fully recovered for 2026. Vondrousova has won all four of her matches against Frech, though three of them were on clay.

Mirra Andreeva [6] vs. Amanda Anisimova [2]: Which Andreeva will we see in Brisbane? The one who won back-to-back WTA 1000 titles as a 17-year-old, or the one who fell back down to Earth in the second half of the year? And how will Anisimova fare in a season that arrives with heightened expectations and pressure? They've only played once, a three-set win for Anisimova in Miami last year that snapped Andreeva's 13-match winning streak.

Seven of the Top 10 are in Brisbane, with World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka possibly headed for a rematch with Madison Keys. On the other side, Amanda Anisimova could meet Mirra Andreeva for a semifinal berth.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Storm Hunter defeated Malene Helgo and Casper Ruud defeated local favourite Alex de Minaur won the singles matches in  the Australia-Norway tie, but the Aussie duo of John-Patrick Smith and Hunter won the deciding mixed doubles match to take the Group D tie.

Australia and Norway were tied 1-1 after the singles matches in their opening United Cup tie in Sydney on Saturday, with Storm Hunter and Casper Ruud each earning straight-sets victories for their countries.

But the Aussie duo of John-Patrick Smith and Hunter rallied past Norway's Viktor Durasovic and Ulrikke Eikeri 4-6, 6-1, [10-4] in a deciding mixed doubles to secure Australia's 2-1 triumph against Norway.

“I'll tell you what, Storm set it up big time there… I was just on the court, I was participating,” Smith said. “She was returning well, she was moving well. She had really good control on all her shots. It was a great win and a great comeback as well. It's never easy playing against a good team.""

Hunter, 31, returned to competition last season after missing nearly a year between March 2024 and March 2025 because of an Achilles tendon injury that required surgery. In the women's singles, she stepped in as a last-minute replacement on Saturday for Australia No. 1 Maya Joint, who was sidelined because of illness.

The experienced left-hander made a fast start against the 26-year-old Helgo, who is competing in the United Cup for the fourth time. Hunter broke serve twice in the opening set to take it 6-2.

Helgo, ranked No. 532 and seeking her first WTA Tour-level victory, raced to a 4-1 lead in the second set before Hunter — a former world No. 1 doubles player and a Grand Slam mixed doubles champion — rallied to level the set at 5-5.

🎙️ ""Team Australia are up and running!"" 💪#UnitedCup pic.twitter.com/ZdOXfKRF7V

Helgo saved three break points in a crucial 11th game to hold for a 6-5 lead, but Hunter held serve to force a tiebreak. The Australian then dominated the tiebreak to seal a 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) victory and give Australia a 1-0 lead.

""This is pretty emotional for me,"" Hunter said during her postmatch interview. ""It's been a tough two years, rupturing my Achilles and finding my way back, relearning everything. I never thought I'd be back on this court in a singles match playing for Australia.

""Obviously, this was Maya's moment. Maya has had an incredible year. Such a shame she couldn't come out tonight. I know she's so excited to come and play in front of everyone. Hopefully she gets an opportunity on Tuesday.  But I'm just glad I could get the win for the team.""

In the second singles match, Ruud produced a solid performance to defeat home favorite Alex de Minaur 6-3, 6-3 in 1 hour, 34 minutes, leveling the tie at 1-1.

“I'm happy to get a great start,"" Ruud told ATP No. 1 Club member Jim Courier in his on-court interview. ""To beat Alex here in Australia is one of the toughest challenges we have in tennis, so I'm super happy to have that on my resume now.”

Ruud played aggressively and decisively, preventing De Minaur from finding any rhythm. The former world No. 2 saved all five break points he faced and consistently put pressure on the Australian's serve, earning 10 break chances and converting three.

""It's a great start a new season,"" Ruud said. ""I think we've all seen Alex in better shape than he was today. He was doing a few unforced errors that typically he doesn't, so I got some free points here and there. You saw in the beginning he was struggling with his serve, so I got a free break and just built from there.""

Stan Wawrinka made a winning start to his farewell season at United Cup in Perth on Saturday, grinding past Arthur Rinderknech, 5-7, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (5), after three hours and 18 minutes on court.And it was a notable win for a few reasons.First of all, it clinched the tie for Switzerland over France, 2-0, after Belinda Bencic beat Leolia Jeanjean in the first match, 6-2, 6-4.But more personally for Wawrinka, he now adds his name to a very impressive list—he's now just the fifth man in the entire Open Era to win a tour-level match in 23 different seasons.MOST SEASONS WITH A TOUR-LEVEL WIN (men, Open Era):25: Jimmy Connors [1970-1989, 1991-1995]24: Roger Federer [1998-2021]24: Richard Gasquet [2002-2025]23: Rafael Nadal [2002-2024]23: Stan Wawrinka [2003, 2005-2026]Four more men are tied at 22, and two of them—Novak Djokovic and Gael Monfils—would join the list with their first win of 2026.

Wawrinka's victory over the No. 29-ranked Rinderknech was also his first Top 30 win in more than eight months, since beating a No. 26-ranked Alexei Popyrin at a Challenger event last May.And he had to survive several brushes with defeat to do it.In the second set, he not only served to stay in the match twice, at 4-5 and 5-6, but he was also two points away from losing at 5-all in the tie-break. Then in the third set, not only was he down an early break at 2-1, but after getting back on serve, he eventually found himself down 4-2 in the third set tie-break—he was even two points away from losing again at 5-all in the breaker.But one last mini-break on the next point is all it took to bring up his first match point, and he closed it out right then and there when one last Rinderknech forehand clipped the net.“Twenty years on tour, you kind of always play the same places and tournaments, so for me it's amazing to have this opportunity to play this year here in Perth for the first time,” he said afterwards.“It's amazing to play with a team tournament with the women, too. Today was tough but I'm really happy to start that way.”

The best battles of the 2025 F1 season

Why you should be excited for the 2026 Formula 1 season

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur discusses the decision to switch focus early on 2026 and the new challenge ahead.

The sweeping changes to the 2026 chassis and power unit regulations offers an opportunity for every team in Formula 1 to make a leap up the pecking order. Some teams switched their attention to this year's car very early in the hope of transforming their fortunes. One of those was Ferrari, who realised they had made a costly error with their 2025 machine and switched all of their resources to 2026 as early as last April, which all but ended their hopes of competing for either World Championship in 2025.

It was a bold decision – and one which means the next few weeks will be tense as they await the first run of their car at their shakedown, most likely at their own track at Fiorano, before running a 'Spec A' at the all-team private test in Barcelona at the end of January.

By the time they reveal 'Spec B' of their new machine for the two Bahrain tests, they will know whether the gamble to go all in early doors on 2026 with the development path they chose was the right one.

At a time when ""memorization feels irrelevant,"" the academic institutions teaching the scions of the entertainment industry are embracing AI in different ways, from browser lockdowns to personalized chatbot avatars.  


							By 

	Degen Pener


Deputy Editor


	Almost immediately after ChatGPT was first released in late 2022, alarm bells sounded in the education world about how it would negatively impact learning. That year, The Atlantic ran stories with headlines like “The College Essay Is Dead” and “The End of High School English.” The predictions were that unleashing AI to the world at large would lead to an exponential rise in cheating at school and that student essays would cease to be original.


	“I mean since day one the narrative in education has been really focused on cheating. And AI is still mostly seen as that thing that kids are using to cheat. So, you know, let's not be naive. There are lots of kids using AI to cheat,” says Leon Furze, an educational consultant and the author of Practical AI Strategies: Engaging with Generative AI in Education. But he adds, “We've got to kind of go beyond that, I think and meet the students where they're at with the technology.”

	Cut to 2025 and that is what's happening at many of Los Angeles' top private schools, where panic has been replaced with pragmatism.


	Yes, there are guardrails. Many schools carve out AI-free zones for test-taking, essay writing and other creative endeavors. “A lot more work, especially writing assignments, is now done exclusively in class,” says showrunner and writer Anthony Sparks (Bel-Air, Queen Sugar), who has a child at the prestigious Harvard-Westlake School.

	











	The same applies at L.A.'s Sierra Canyon School (where recent graduates have included Bronny and Bryce James). Says Noah B. Salomon, the school's English department chair, “For most assignments, in order to preserve training in independent critical thinking, we create an environment where students cannot use AI [such as] in-class writing, participating, graded discussions.”


	But as generative AI continues to seep into seemingly every facet of society, administrators and teachers are increasingly looking at creative ways to engage with the technology with an eye toward preparing students for the real world. 


	Last July, The Buckley School (which Laura Dern, Bret Easton Ellis and Paris Hilton once attended) held a one-week AI Intensive summer camp on campus ($1,500 for the week), where middle-school-age students could learn everything from “AI + Art” to how to “leverage machine learning to help first responders allocate resources in crisis situations.”


	At Windward School (which Josh Groban and Zoe Kazan attended), a special education and tech team has been working on helping teachers deepen their understanding of ChatGPT, Google Gemini and MagicSchool AI (an education focused AI platform).


	And at Sierra Canyon School, the administration has formed a partnership with AI education platform edYOU, which provides students with personalized chatbot avatars that can help them with everything from tutoring to tracking their coursework.

	











	Sierra Canyon's Salomon details additional ways that the school is engaging students in the use of AI. “We have asked teachers to experiment, to find ways to leverage the power of AI in their teaching and to encourage students to use AI in a way that is ethical and that does not interfere with their learning or their curiosity. For example, students in a literature class might be asked to have a conversation with ChatGPT about a particular chapter of a novel, but they will be required to use specific quotes from the novel to challenge ChatGPT's initial reading. Students might be encouraged to use AI to create quizzes on material or to have AI review an essay to offer another source of feedback on structure.”


	And for every student who wants to use AI as a crutch or shortcut, there are other students who are concerned about using it responsibly, even sparingly. “I had a 13-year-old student who asked me, ‘Even if my school teaches us how to use AI, should we?'” shares Furze. “And she was really concerned that if she starts using AI at 13 years old, that by the time she's 18, she won't be able to use her own brain anymore. There are really young students who are genuinely concerned about this. On the flip side, I'm also seeing that there's a lot of pressure with students to use AI because they think they'll be outcompeted. There's a lot of perception that, ‘if I don't use AI, the student next to me is going to use AI and they're going to do better. So I have to use it to stay competitive.'”

	











	Adds Stacie Muñoz, director of educational innovation and technology services at Oakwood School (whose alumni include Chris Pine and Lily-Rose Depp), “I think there is an assumption that all kids are using AI all the time and I will say that I have talked to many kids who are not falling in that camp and are really hesitant about AI and actually like look down upon others for using it. You know, these kids are really smart now.”


	Even so, Oakwood School is also requiring that more writing is done in-class and it's evaluating various forms of technology that can be harnessed to limit and prevent AI use, including so-called browser lockdowns on computers. “Kids can still type, but they can't access other things on their computers,” says Muñoz. She adds that, “we utilize things like Google Docs ‘Version History' checker to sort of keep an eye that kids are staying within their documents doing the work … because we're seeing that it's just so easy to default to using AI.” But Oakwood is not currently using AI checkers to evaluate whether students use the technology in completing assignments. “We actually did a professional development for teachers in a recent meeting where we took an email that I used AI to help me write and we put it through three different AI checkers and they all came up with different responses. One said no AI was used, one said about 50 percent. They all said different things. So we actually use that as an example for our teachers to say, ‘We can't actually trust AI against AI.'

	











	“And if anything,” she continues, “it's just gonna build distrust with our students. That's not a direction we're choosing to go in because there's really no proof that those work. And if anything, it's just gonna build more distrust.”


	School leaders and students are also navigating a host of other concerns around AI from thinking about whether AI will increase or diminish career prospects in certain fields (like graphic design or video game design) to looking at the environmental impact of the technology, which is dramatically increasing energy usage across the globe.” At a school like Oakwood, sustainability is really important to our students and our community,” says Muñoz. “They are thinking about the long-term effects of constant AI use on our planet.”


	For parents and tech entrepreneurs Adam Ayers and Victoria de la Fuente, who live in Los Angeles and have two young boys, the dawning of generative AI factors into their decision making around schooling. The couple (who founded social platform Doomscrollr) currently send their elder son to a Montessori school “because they're really focusing on independence, on self-learning and teachable life skills,” says de la Fuente, who is also the founder of Zillion Trillion, an education-focused Substack newsletter and podcast. More than ever, the couple want to avoid schools that put a focus on memorization, while favoring schools that lean into process-based learning. “From what I can see in the schools I've been visiting, they're still very much pushing the memorization route. It just feels like in the age of AI where they can just have vast access to all that information. It feels irrelevant,” says de la Fuente.

	











	That's something that resonates with Muñoz: “For us, it's about finding a balance of when can we insert AI appropriately without losing that human piece. It's really pushed us to work with teachers on how we can reevaluate the way we are teaching and maybe change some of our assessments a little bit to focus on more of the human elements that AI can't replicate. How do we really incentivize being human? That's a big part of our conversation.”

The Oscar winner drew on relationships from 30 years in the entertainment industry and the experience she'd amassed in front of the camera for her star-studded Netflix film 'Goodbye June.'


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast


	For her directorial debut, Kate Winslet made a star-studded family drama, in which she was one of the actors, over just seven weeks, securing star Helen Mirren for only 16 days.


	The schedule and Winslet's dual roles were just some of the many challenges she faced helming Goodbye June.




	“We were constantly trying to make sure that we were all making our days. I never wanted to drop anything, and I didn't. I was very proud of that,” Winslet recently told The Hollywood Reporter at a special screening of the Netflix movie in New York, speaking of the shortened filming schedule. “We had seven children in the film as well as all of our adult actors, so just the constant juggle of that and being in front of the camera as well as behind it, just the juggle of it all we had to adapt to very quickly.”

	Still, she “loved” the experience, she said, unprovoked, adding, when asked if she wants to direct again, “I really hope I do. I would love to direct again.”


	And Winslet's extensive acting career, including the bonds she'd developed with others in the industry through her 30 years in front of the camera, was key to this endeavor.


	“Being able to really lean on great relationships that I've developed over the years, that was very meaningful, because we needed to have that sense of goodwill around us,” Winslet said, adding that it was imperative to have people who were “good humored, really willing and supportive of one another.”


	For the role of June's (Mirren) husband Bernie, Winslet approached Timothy Spall, with whom she'd worked 30 years before on a production of Hamlet, and it was this past experience as well as the strength of the script, written by Winslet's son, Joe Anders, that convinced Spall to board the project.

	











	“I knew that she was a very special person and a very special actress,” Spall told THR of Winslet at the Goodbye June screening. “When I read the script, I said I wouldn't be able to do it because I was working too hard. But I read it the following day and told her I wanted to do it because it's so fantastic. And she, I knew, would be all over it because of the way she spoke about it. It was so close to her and such a sense of what it was going to be about. Given her brilliance as an actress and what she's experienced as an actress, I knew she'd be absolutely perfect. It was time for her to direct.”


	And as a director, Winslet lived up to Spall's expectations, with him calling her “one of the best directors I've ever worked with” and praising her for doing “a massive amount of preparation” but making the process “feel completely natural.”


	“She did all the work, all the amazing work it takes. She covered every department; she cast it so well; she chose the people to be behind the camera and in front of the camera,” Spall explained. “She was so brilliant about being in charge of things and making you feel as though it's all happening at the same time. That takes a bit of genius. That takes a very good heart, massive intelligence, a lot of confidence and a lot of openness, and she's got all of those things. It's not an easy thing to direct a movie because it's like being the president or the prime minister. You've got a lot of things to take into consideration.”


	Co-star Toni Collette, who plays one of Winslet's character's sisters and June's daughter, echoed this praise of the low-key set.

	











	“It was just easy. It was like a totally natural progression for her, having worked in film for 30 years and worked with so many wonderful directors,” Collette told THR. “She creates an incredible atmosphere of freedom. It just felt very grounded, very accepting, very relaxed and free.”


	The Wayward star also spoke about how Winslet's experience as an actress helped her behind the camera.


	“The one thing I think we have on our side as actors is we get to work with a lot of different directors. Directors don't get to do that,” Collette told THR. “So they get to see how other people work. She could obviously have her own intelligence and intuition but also take from all of the wonderful people she'd worked with.”


	And for Collette personally, working with Winslet was the fulfillment of a decades-long desire to collaborate.


	“I have wanted to work with Kate for decades. I have been a fan. There's so much in her that I admire as a person, her work, her career, everything, what she stands for, what she fights for,” Collette said. “I got a call out of the blue saying she wanted to talk to me about a project. Then I heard that she was directing. I mean, I would have been happy acting, but when someone chooses you to be in their directorial debut, it's such an honor. I spoke to her within 48 hours. She took me through the story. I was like, sign me up.” 


	She continued, “When I read [the script], it was completely heartbreaking and also made my heart soar in the best possible way because it's such a realistic, gorgeous story about this average, dysfunctional family going through something really, really challenging. I just think it's a really special story. And she just put the most incredible group of people together on and offscreen. It was such a magical experience, one of the best.”

	











Goodbye June is now streaming on Netflix.

	UK rapper EsDeeKid has publicly called out The Chainsmokers after the duo shared a remix of his track “4 Raws” that he says was released without his approval.


	In a post on X on Jan. 2, EsDeeKid wrote that the remix was “getting NUKED,” writing, “that chainsmokers remix is getting NUKED mate wow please. don't remix my sh– and think it's cool to post to all DSPs.”

that chainsmokers remix is getting NUKED mate wow 💀💀please don't remix my shit and think it's cool to post to all DSPs🕊️


	Shortly afterwards, the remix appeared to be removed from YouTube and SoundCloud, though clips continued circulating on social media. The Chainsmokers had not publicly responded at the time of publication.


	The incident is the latest flashpoint in a recent run of remix activity from the EDM duo, who have been posting reworks of high-profile songs to their social channels. One notable exception is The Chainsmokers' “The Fate of Ophelia” remix with Taylor Swift, which is currently available on Spotify as an official credited release. 


	EsDeeKid has had an unusually high-visibility year despite maintaining a masked, anonymous persona — including viral fan speculation that he was actor Timothée Chalamet, which culminated in Chalamet joining EsDeeKid's “4 Raws” remix.


	“It's Timothée Chalamet chillin', tryna stack a hundred million/ Girl got a billion/ What the f—, what a wonderful feeling,” Chalamet flexed about his beauty mogul girlfriend, Kylie Jenner. 

	











	The Oscar-nominated actor made sure to plug his upcoming Marty Supreme film, as the promo tour has taken him across the globe and even into the studio for one of the most unique campaigns Hollywood's seen in recent years.


	“My life is an opera, look at the Oscars/ Look at the groupies, look at the movies/ Look at the triple A, girl gon' choose me/ Look at my haters, man, they wanna sue me,” he rapped.


	Chalamet had previously responded to interview questions on rumours he was EsDeeKid. “All will be revealed in due time,” he told Heart Radio in the U.K. and other outlets while promoting A24's Marty Supreme.


	EsDeeKid rode the momentum behind the bubbling speculation to a surge in streams of his Rebel album, which launched at No. 131 Billboard 200 in November.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


UPDATED: Networks provided early morning special reports on Saturday as explosions were heard in Caracas, Venezuela, what President Donald Trump later confirmed was a “large scale strike” in the country and that it's leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured and flown out of the country.


	Trump, in Mar-a-Lago for the holiday break, posted at 4:21 a.m. ET, “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow. There will be a News Conference today at 11 A.M., at Mar-a-Lago. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DONALD J. TRUMP.”

	NBC News' Peter Alexander anchored an NBC News special report from 4 a.m. ET to 6:45 a.m. ET, before anchoring Saturday Today with Laura Jarrett. Tom Llamas will anchor NBC Nightly News on Saturday evening from Miami.




			Watch on Deadline		







	ABC News' Alison Kosik provided special reports at 3:56 a.m. ET and 4:29 a.m. ET. She noted that “there have been scenes of multiple explosions and low-flying aircraft,” starting about 2 a.m. local time.


	CBS News provided special reports at 2:42 a.m. ET and 4:42 a.m. ET. The network's Jennifer Jacobs reported that Maduro was captured by Delta Force, the elite special mission unit. 


	Fox News' Chanley Painter anchored coverage starting in the 1 a.m. ET hour, along with Eric Shawn through the early morning. Griff Jenkins took over coverage at 5 a.m. ET, leading up to Fox & Friends Weekend at 6 a.m. ET. Trump later talked on the phone to the network. “I watched it literally like I was watching a TV show,” Trump said of the U.S. operation. “The speed, the violence … it was an amazing thing. It was amazing job that these people did.”

	











	Trump said that the U.S. would be involved in establishing new leadership in the country. “We can't take a chance in letting someone just run and take over where he left, or left off,” Trump said.


	On CNN, anchor Elex Michaelson, who hosts a nightly show from Los Angeles, reported at about 1:42 a.m. on the explosions heard in Caracas. He eported that CNN's own teams “personally witnessed explosions” starting at around 1:15 a.m. in the morning local time. He then went to a phone interview with journalist Mary Mena. 


	MS NOW featured coverage throughout the morning, with Rachel Maddow appearing and Ali Velshi anchoring.


	The strikes may have been a surprise in timing, but not that they were carried out, as media attention has focused on the increased U.S. military pressure campaign against Maduro. But it also raises questions of Trump's authority to carry out the strikes without congressional authorization. 


	Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) wrote on X, “I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.” He later wrote that he had a conversation with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “He informed me that Nicolás Maduro has been arrested by U.S. personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant. This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack.”


	Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement, “If the United States asserts the right to use military force to invade and capture foreign leaders it accuses of criminal conduct, what prevents China from claiming the same authority over Taiwan's leadership? What stops Vladimir Putin from asserting similar justification to abduct Ukraine's president? Once this line is crossed, the rules that restrain global chaos begin to collapse, and authoritarian regimes will be the first to exploit it.


	“None of this absolves Maduro. He is a corrupt authoritarian who has repressed his people, stolen elections, imprisoned political opponents, and presided over a humanitarian catastrophe that has forced millions of Venezuelans to flee. The Venezuelan people deserve democratic leadership, and the United States and the international community should have done far more, years ago, to press for a peaceful transition after Maduro lost a vote of his own citizens. But recognizing Maduro's crimes does not give any president the authority to ignore the Constitution.”


	Attorney General Pam Bondi later noted that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been indicted on charges of narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices. 


	“They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,” Bondi wrote. 


	Trump is scheduled to have a news conference at 11 a.m. ET.

	Three years after it was announced, Mike Flanagan is closer than ever to bringing his series adaptation of Stephen King‘s The Dark Tower to life.


	The acclaimed horror filmmaker called the upcoming series an “oil tanker” as he shared an update on his and Trevor Macy's Intrepid Pictures take on King's series of books that were released from 1982 to 2012.


	“It's moving,” Flanagan told Empire Magazine. “We've got a lot of scripts done for it. It's the first priority.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Following the 2017 Nikolaj Arcel-helmed feature adaptation, Flanagan said, “We can't let that be the final word. We really can't.” Starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, the film currently holds a 16% critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

	











	In 2022, Flanagan told Deadline exclusively that he'd completed a pilot script for the adaptation, which he envisions as running for five seasons, followed by two stand-alone movies.


	“You're the first person we're saying it to, but yes,” he said at the time. “Predating our deal with Amazon, we acquired the rights to The Dark Tower, which if you know anything about me, you know it has been my Holy Grail of a project for most of my life.”


	Flanagan added, “We actually have those rights carved out of our Amazon deal, which doesn't mean that they can't or won't get behind it at some point — you don't know. But that's something we've been developing ourselves and are really passionate about finally getting it up on its feet at some point.”

	











Amazon Studios previously opted not to pick up a Dark Tower series from executive producer/showrunner Glen Mazzara and MRC in 2020.

	As he reprises his role in HBO‘s upcoming Harry Potter series, Warwick Davis recently teased how the show differs from the films.


	The BAFTA honoree, who returns as Professor Flitwick after originating the role in the films, explained that the episodes are “very faithful adaptations” of the J.K. Rowling fantasy book series.


	“I'm working on it at the moment, but I can't really tell you anything other than we're retelling those wonderful stories but with more depth and detail than has been seen before,” he told Times Radio. “They're very faithful adaptations of the book.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Davis added, “We're obviously telling the same story so there are similar moments that we're experiencing as actors on the set. But it's weird being back in the same studios again, doing it all again, because Leavesden is where we shot the films.”

	











	After pulling triple duty as Prof. Flitwick, a goblin bank teller and the voice of Griphook in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), Davis appeared in all eight of the film adaptations. While he reprises his role as Flitwick in the series, Leigh Gill will play Griphook.


	The series adaptation as Rowling faces continued fallout over her anti-transgender views from fans and peers alike, including stars of the franchise and director Christopher Columbus.


	Rowling previously celebrated UK‘s Supreme Court ruling that prohibits trans women from being legally recognized as women. More than 400 people signed a letter urging the country's film and television industry to take action on trans rights, including Paapa Essiedu, who has been cast in the Harry Potter series as Professor Snape.

	Cue a likely new version of the opening credits song for The White Lotus, because Season 4 is in the works, though it doesn't look like the song will sound the same as that of Season 3.


	After three seasons of the HBO drama, set in Hawaii, Italy and Thailand, respectively, the fourth season will head back to Europe with some cast already assembled.


	For everything we know about The White Lotus Season 4, read on.


When will The White Lotus Season 4 come out?


			Watch on Deadline		







	A release date won't be available for some time, as the full cast has not yet been assembled nor has Season 4 begun production.

	











Where will Season 4 of The White Lotus take place?


	Deadline first reported that the luxurious hotel chain series that features wealthy guests has opened up a location in France for the fourth season.

Who will be in the cast of The White Lotus Season 4?


	So far, Helena Bonham Carter has been in talks to join the fourth season. Following Deadline's report of that news, Alexander Ludwig and AJ Michalka joined the new season.


Who will be the connecting character for The White Lotus Season 4?


	No word yet on who is set to recur as a character who has already appeared in a previous season of the series, which is a trend that the second and third installments have followed. Jennifer Coolidge bridged Seasons 1 and 2, and Natasha Rothwell appeared in Seasons 1 and 3. Jon Gries appeared in all three seasons. Charlotte Le Bon is a strong contender for Season 4's connecting character because she speaks French, and she is Jon Gries' character Greg's new girlfriend.

	











Who else is behind The White Lotus Season 4?


	Season 4 is created, written, and directed by Mike White. Executive producers include White, David Bernad, and Mark Kamine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Andy Cohen sets the record straight on plastic surgery speculation after New Year's Eve special","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/02/celebrity-news/andy-cohen-addresses-plastic-surgery-speculation-after-new-years-eve-special/","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 02:51:00 GMT","

Andy Cohen shut down speculation that he got plastic surgery ahead of hosting CNN's “New Year's Eve Live.” 

“Did the smallest amount of Botox and lost 20 pounds ! And had a lot of makeup on,” Cohen wrote via Threads on Thursday. 

The comment came in response to fan Thread reading, “I just saw the new clips of Andy Cohen on NYE and WTF did he do to his face?!? Is he trying to find a new husband at Mar-a-Lago?” 

The “Watch What Happens Live” host appeared alongside Anderson Cooper for the fan-favorite New Year's Eve broadcast from Times Square on Wednesday evening. 

Many fans sounded off on the Bravo mogul's appearance with supportive comments. 

“He looked like he always has … rested and refreshed no doubt. Handsome man. As well as Anderson too ❤️👏🏼” one person wrote, while another added, “Don't pick on Andy ! He's perfect 😍” 

A third noted that Cohen is “obviously entirely entitled to do whatever makes him continue to feel fabulous!” 

“Darling, you looked marvelous,” a fourth gushed. 

Cohen, 57, confessed earlier this year to having used Botox to achieve a more youthful appearance. 

“I just got it for the first time in my life,” he told Dr. Contessa Metcalfe during the “Married to Medicine” Season 11 reunion in March. 

When asked “how long ago,” Cohen replied, “About a month ago. They gave me a little.”

In January, the TV personality — who frequently questions “Real Housewives” cast members on what plastic surgeries they've undergone — responded to fan backlash over the tactic.

“The millions of women who watch these franchises are tired of you asking women ‘what work they had done,'” a critic wrote on X at the time.

“This isn't 2009 anymore and women can do whatever they want to their face/bodies,” they continued. “It's time to retire this question. It's rude and does 0 for the viewers.”

Cohen responded, “‘What work have you done' remains at the top of the list of viewer questions every season, every franchise.”

“The HW have unabashedly let us into their beauty regimes since day one; It's a big part of the series DNA.”

Prior to the social media exchange, “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” cast member Erika Jayne slammed Cohen for the line of questioning during a 2019 reunion episode. 

“I hate it when people say ‘What work have you had done?' What work have you had done? I think she should answer it, but at the same time it's kind of rude,” Jayne interrupted Cohen as he relayed a fan question to Dorit Kemsley. 

At the time, Cohen gently explained that there was “no judgment” in the question. 

“I think since the ‘Housewives' has begun, one of the tropes I think that is common among every city and every franchise is women chasing the fountain of youth and trying to look better and look great,” he said.

Beloved makeup artist Jasen Kaplan's cause of death has reportedly been ruled as a suicide. 

Authorities listed Kaplan's “blunt impact injuries of torso and extremities” as the cause of his death, per TMZ. 

Sources also told the outlet that the injuries were “consistent with a fall from height.” 

The New York City medical examiner's office did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment. 

Sources previously told Page Six Kaplan died in a New York City hospital just hours before the ball dropped in Times Square on Dec. 31. He was 46 years old.  

Quickly, Hollywood began to mourn the devastating loss of the makeup artist who was known to work closely Bethenny Frankel, Tinsley Mortimer, Lydia Hearst and Kelly Osbourne.

“He was a great artist, and a sweet guy,” a longtime friend told us of Kaplan, “When people started working with him, they often stayed with him for years.”

“He really was important to a lot of people,” said one, “some of his clients had been with him more than 20 years. They're going to take it very hard.”

Kaplan earned his claim to fame as an artist when he worked with Brittny and Lisa Gastineau on their 2005 show “Gastineau Girls.”

Along with Osbourne and Frankel, Kaplan was known as a go-to makeup artist for stars including Eva Longoria, Lynda Carter and Cyndi Lauper.

Kaplan also starred as a contestant on “Finding Prince Charming,” a gay, “Bachelor”-style dating show produced by Lance Bass for Logo in 2016.

Kaplan marks the second loss in connection with the “Finding Prince Charming” franchise. Another contestant, Chad Spodick, died last month, per People.

Months after accusing UMG of artificially inflating Kendrick Lamar's Spotify streams, Canadian humiliation artist Drake has been named in a federal class-action RICO suit, claiming he artificially inflated streams to “manufacture popularity” and used the online casino Stake.us to transfer money for the scheme. Per NBC News, in a complaint filed in Virginia on December 31, Drake and—yup, this is about to get worse—Adin Ross, the manosphere-adjacent streamer who recently tricked NFL star Puka Nacua into doing an antisemitic meme, are accused of using Stake.us to transfer money via the site's tipping feature. The third accused co-conspirator is an “Australian national” named George Nguyen, who “served as a facilitator and operational broker—alternately converting Stake-based cryptocurrency to cash, or receiving cash from Stake transferred cryptocurrency proceeds.” Drake is a brand ambassador for Stake.us and its parent company, Sweepstakes Limited. In 2022, he reportedly signed a promotional contract with the company worth more than $100 million.

“At the heart of the scheme, Drake—acting directly and through willing and knowledgeable co-conspirators—has deployed automated bots and streaming farms to artificially inflate play counts of his music across major platforms, such as Spotify,” the complaint reads.

Stake.us rose from the ashes of Stake.com after the latter was banned from operating in the U.S. The site allows users to use funny money in the form of Stake Cash and Gold Coins instead of actual currency. Drake and his fellow plaintiffs allegedly used the site's money transfer capabilities as “an unlimited and wholly unregulated money transmitter that appears to exist outside the oversight of any financial regulator.” The suit claims that the three used their profits from Stake to “create fraudulent streams of Drake's music; fabricate popularity; disparage competitors and music label executives; distort recommendation algorithms; and distribute financing for all of the foregoing, while concealing the flow of funds.” The class-action suit in Virginia seeks residents who lost one or more wagers using Stake Cash in the last three years.

Tom Brady's love life has been nearly as headline-worthy as his legendary NFL career. From high-profile Hollywood relationships to one of the most famous marriages in sports history, the retired quarterback's romantic journey has played out in the public eye for more than two decades. As a new year begins and new rumors start with “Dancing With the Stars” finalist Alix Earle, fans remain just as curious about where Brady stands now as they are about how he got here.

Before Brady became a seven-time Super Bowl champion, he dated several well-known figures during those early years in the spotlight.

In the early 2000s, Brady was briefly linked to famous actresses and models, including Tara Reid and Layla Roberts.

Yes, these relationships were all short-lived. However, they marked the beginning of Brady's transition into full-blown celebrity territory. Suddenly, his personal life started to become fascinating to the public.

A very significant relationship that happened early in his career was with actress Bridget Moynahan. Brady and Moynahan were together from 2004 until 2006.

However, soon after their breakup, Brady got some shocking news. Moynahan was pregnant with his son, Jack.

Despite the timing, Brady has gone on to fully embrace fatherhood. Brady and Moynahan have been very respectful of each other, and their co-parenting skills have been praised publicly.

Life changed big time for Tom Brady in 2006, besides finding out he was going to become a father for the first time. He also met supermodel Gisele Bündchen that year.

This meeting soon turned into one of Brady's most significant and well-known relationships. I mean, you have an elite NFL quarterback and one of the biggest supermodels in the world dating? Yeah, everyone wanted to talk about them.

The couple was married in 2009 and had two children together, son Benjamin and daughter Vivian. Life was busy for Tom and Gisele, but they were both able to maintain their top-level jobs and recognition around the world for over a decade together.

All good things have to come to an end, though. The couple announced they were getting a divorce in 2002, ending their 13-year marriage.

In statements, they both said they were committed to co-parenting together. They wanted to respect each other during the difficult time. This divorce marked a huge turning point in Brady's personal life.

Not only was Brady's dating life the talk of the town, but then he announced his retirement from the NFL again in 2023. That same year, he was connected to another supermodel, this time Irina Shayk.

According to reports, the two spent time together all year long. Neither of them, nevertheless, acknowledged a committed relationship. Reports and sightings pointed to a casual yet sincere relationship.

Brady created more excitement in 2025 when he was seen on vacation with Sofia Vergara, a judge on “America's Got Talent.” Sources played it down, claiming it was nothing more than a summer romance.

Actress Sydney Sweeney was also connected to Brady after the two were spotted becoming close at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's wedding. But that interaction did not lead to anything further.

As 2026 kicked off, Brady seems to be enjoying life beyond football, even though he still serves as an NFL commentator and is a part-owner of the Las Vegas Raiders.

He continues to casually date. Brady made headlines over the holidays, this time thanks to influencer Alix Earle.

The pair were seen together celebrating New Year's Eve in St. Barths. Neither of them has confirmed any of these rumors, but it has revived those romance rumors for Brady.

For now, Brady, 48, seems to be prioritizing his personal happiness, business ventures, and family. He doesn't seem to want to hurry into anything significant. However, his fans can't stop discussing his love life and what the next chapter may entail.

Andrew Walker is bringing the Christmas spirit with him into 2026. The longtime Hallmark star has been “blown away” by the response to a giveaway he's hosting to help raise funds for the Alzheimer Society of Canada. 

Up for grabs? A “Three Wisest Men” t-shirt signed by himself and his co-stars, Tyler Hynes and Paul Campbell. By the morning of January 2, Walker shared in his Instagram Stories that three days' worth of donations had already raised $6,000 for a cause extremely close to his heart, given that his mom suffered from Alzheimer's for years before her passing in 2023. 

Each donation made via Walker's fundraising page by 11 p.m. Eastern time on January 2, 2026, counts as an entry for the giveaway. The contest is open to fans in the U.S. and Canada who are 18 and older. 

Walker and his team will randomly select a name from those who've donated to the fundraiser since December 30. The “She's Making a List” star said that on January 3, he'll announce via his Instagram account who won the prize and how much was raised in total. 

On the morning of January 2, Walker posted in his Instagram Stories, “Absolutely blown away by your generosity. 💜 We've already raised $6,000 for the @alzheimercanada. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!” 

Walker also shared a bit of sweet encouragement in his Instagram Story update, telling his followers, “If you're starting the year in a tougher place, I'm holding you in my thoughts, may the days get kinder and brighter.” 

The actor is no stranger to tough times, having lost his beloved mom — Joyce Francis Crossley Walker — in March 2023 after years of decline due to Alzheimer's. In 2024, Walker told EntertainmentNow that his mom was known in their family for having an amazing memory, even recalling “phone numbers and songs and soliloquies of plays that she learned when she was younger.” 

But as Walker's star was rising at Hallmark, he and his family — dad Bruce and sister JenniMay — began noticing significant changes in Joyce's memory, enough so that in 2013, they insisted she be evaluated at a renowned memory clinic in Montréal, where they lived. 

“We took her kicking and screaming,” Walker admitted. “It was not pretty, but we just needed to know what our options were to help slow the process.”

The “Curious Caterer” star told EntertainmentNow that Joyce's condition rapidly declined during the COVID pandemic, between the progression of Alzheimer's and signs of Parkinson's, a closely-linked neurological disorder. Since her death, Walker has helped his Hallmark friends Nikki DeLoach and Ashley Williams — who also lost parents to forms of the disease — with their fundraising efforts for the Alzheimer's Association in the U.S. 

Walker also said he thinks his mom would be proud of his efforts to help fund research and build awareness around the disease that stole so much from her, telling EntertainmentNow, “She was my creative muse. She was the one that got me into acting. So here she is now, you know, looking down from above and seeing what we're doing.” 

My husband and my dad both suffered from Alzheimer's and passed away. Thank you for doing this fund raiser. Unfortunately, I didn't see it in time to donate for the t-shirt, but I will donate to the Alzheimer's Association. Their support group got me through some very difficult times, and I am still friends with a lot of the people I met in the group. I would tell anyone out there taking care of or knows someone with this horrible disease to reach out to the Alzheimer's support groups.  God bless you and have a happy, safe, and healthy 2026.

Billy Joel returned to the stage for the first time since revealing his brain disorder diagnosis, performing a surprise two-song set alongside a Billy Joel cover band at a Florida village amphitheater.


	The Piano Man was on hand as the town of Wellington, Florida — near where Joel owns property — celebrated its 30th anniversary Friday. The Joel cover band Turnstiles was booked to perform at the celebration, and Joel himself joined them onstage to perform “We Didn't Start the Fire” and “Big Shot.”


	“I wasn't planning on working tonight,” Joel quipped, the Palm Beach Post reports. As Joel played the piano alongside Turnstiles, his daughters Della and Remy danced next to him onstage.


	The surprise performance marked Joel's first time back on stage since May 2025, when the singer revealed a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus and subsequently canceled all of his upcoming concerts; Joel's last concert was on February 22, 2025.

	











	“This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision, and balance,” Joel's team said in a statement at the time. “Under his doctor's instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period. Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health.”

	Despite the stark-sounding disorder, Joel insisted that he's “not dying.” “I feel good,” Joel later told Bill Maher in a July 2025 interview. “They keep referring to what I have as a brain disorder, so it sounds a lot worse than what I'm feeling… “They keep referring to what I have as a brain disorder, so it sounds a lot worse than what I'm feeling.”


	Joel added that while his condition was not yet “fixed,” it was “being worked on.” It's unclear whether Friday's surprise performance signals Joel is ready to return to the live stage.

Chevy Chase‘s abrupt departure from Community in 2012 has resurfaced following the debut of the new CNN documentary, I'm Chevy Chase and You're Not. 


	In a joint interview with The New York Times published upon the film's release on Jan. 1, Chase and director Marina Zenovich discussed his firing from the NBC series by creator Dan Harmon after 83 episodes for reportedly using a racial slur on set. 


	When asked how he felt about his role ending, in which he played the crotchety Pierce Hawthorne, Chase replied, “It was too great a misunderstanding of what I was saying and not saying. I thought that there was at least one person — and another who, for some ungodly reason, didn't get me, didn't know who I was, or didn't realize for one second I'm not racist.” He added, “They were too young to be aware of my work. Instead, there was some sort of visceral reaction from them.”


	According to The Times, the documentary covers allegations that Chase, who had become frustrated with his character's escalating bigotry and a scene in which the character uses a hand puppet wearing blackface, said a racial slur when asking whether his character would be made to say it next.

	In the CNN documentary, Community director Jay Chandrasekhar mentioned co-star Yvette Nicole Brown when recalling the incident. Brown appeared to address the film in a recent Instagram post, writing, “These are things I've never spoken of publicly and perhaps never will. Anyone currently speaking FOR or ABOUT me with perceived authority is speaking without EVER speaking to me about the things they claim to know about.”

	She added, “In East Cleveland speak: Keep my name out your mouth.” In the caption, Brown wrote, “And when someone chooses to sully or defile themselves, I let them — BIG age or not. And they need to fully own what they alone have done without placing blame or looking for scapegoats. Don't smear any of that mess over here for clout or reputation rehabilitation. This side of the street remains clean.”


	In 2018, The New Yorker profiled Chase's Community co-star, Donald Glover, and reported that Chase would attempt to disrupt Glover's scenes and made racial jokes on set. “I just saw Chevy as fighting time—a true artist has to be O.K. with his reign being over,” said Glover. “I can't help him if he's thrashing in the water. But I know there's a human in there somewhere—he's almost too human.”

	Several Change.org petitions to deport Nicki Minaj to her native Trinidad and Tobago have amassed more than 120,000 signatures combined. The most popular petition — garnering over 83,000 signatures — started on July 9, 2025, and lists Minaj's “harrass[ment]” of “the Carters” as one of the inciting issues (Minaj had been incessantly lambasting Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter on X at the time). There are also at least three other petitions created between Dec. 21 and 28, 2025, that coincide with Minaj's controversial Dec. 21 appearance alongside conservative activist Erika Kirk at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest, where the rapper praised President Donald Trump's administration.


	One of the recent petitions began on Dec. 27 by a 16 year-old in Chicago named Tristan Hamilton, per the website, and has gained the most ground, with over 41,000 signatures at the time of writing. Using a photo of Minaj high-fiving Kirk as the petition's lead image, Hamilton wrote that Minaj has left her LGBTQ fans “feeling deeply betrayed,” pointing to Minaj's AmericaFest comments, “Boys, be boys…There's nothing wrong with being a boy.” Some have seen Minaj's appearance at the event as the rapper aligning with Turning Point's historically anti-trans and queerphobic leadership. “Deporting Nicki Minaj back to Trinidad would serve as a reminder that public figures need to be accountable for their words and the broader impact they have on diverse communities,” wrote Hamilton. “It's not just about one person's fall from grace; it's about holding everyone to a standard of compassion and consistency, especially when they possess significant influence.” Representatives for Hamilton and Nicki Minaj did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone's requests for comment.

	Minaj's AmericaFest appearance also came in the midst of the Trump administration's virulent campaign against immigration as well as against several Black, Asian, Arab, and Latin territories around the world, including in the Caribbean. ProPublica reports that amid the U.S.'s recent mass deportations, over 170 U.S. citizens have also been held by immigration agents.

	It's not immediately clear whether there would be any legal basis for deporting Minaj, who reportedly wrote in 2018 that she came to the U.S. “as an illegal immigrant at 5 years old.” At the time, she had shared an Instagram post advocating against the separation of migrant children from their parents in Trump's first administration. “I can't imagine the horror of being in a strange place & having my parents stripped away from me at the age of 5,” she reportedly continued. “This is so scary to me. Please stop this. Can you try to imagine the terror & panic these kids feel right now? Not knowing if their parents are dead or alive, if they'll ever see them again.” 


	Minaj's current citizenship status is also unclear, though in 2024, she said, “I'm not a citizen of America. Isn't that crazy?” during a TikTok Live stream. “You would think that with the millions of dollars that I've paid in taxes to this country that I would have been given an honorary citizenship many, many, many thousands of years ago.”


	While comments appear to be disabled on the largest petition calling for Minaj's deportation, under Hamilton's, self-proclaimed former fans wrote messages like, “It's hard to reconcile the ‘Black Barbies' rapper—who once spoke out about the terror of immigration policies—with this version of Nicki who cozy up to Erika Kirk, a woman whose platform is built on ideologies that have historically marginalized Black and trans voice [sic].” Using the name Charlie, the commenter continued, “It's not just about a ‘difference of opinion'—it's about watching someone you admired lend their immense cultural capital to people who haven't shown that same love back to our community.”

	Some TikTok users have attributed the petition to what they see as Minaj's implicit support of anti-immigration sentiments coming back to bite her. Without endorsing the petition, @nsddahmmy said, “Its even crazier from Nicki Minaj, because as quick as they can send her to the [United Nations] to advocate for us committing more war crimes in Nigeria or to high five Erika Kirk while she disparages the demographics that make up what's left of her fanbase, is as quick as they could have sent ICE with a one way ticket back to Trinidad.” 


Other users have seemingly defended Minaj and mocked the petition with short videos merely looking into the camera with variants of captions like, “Wait a second, I thought liberals were against deportations and ICE,” positing that the petitions are hypocritical (and claiming that all “liberals” are in fact against deportations). The full scope of the petitioners' politics is unknown.

	The family of Victoria Jones, the daughter of actor Tommy Lee Jones, has released a statement following her tragic death at the age of 34 on New Year's Day.


	“We appreciate all of the kind words, thoughts, and prayers. Please respect our privacy during this difficult time,” said the family in a statement to Rolling Stone on Friday.


	Jones was reportedly found unresponsive at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco on Jan. 1. A cause of death has not yet been given, though in police dispatch audio obtained by People, the call for the incident was classified as “code three,” suggesting a possible drug overdose. 


	The San Francisco Fire Department confirmed in a statement shared with Rolling Stone that it responded to a “report of a medical emergency” at the hotel around 2:52 a.m. on New Year's Day. “Upon arrival, paramedics from the fire department performed an assessment,” the statement read. “The person was declared deceased.”


	Victoria was one of two children Jones had with his second wife, Kimberlea Cloughley. The couple were married from 1981 to 1996 and also had a son, Austin, who is 43. Victoria appeared alongside her father in several of his films, including a cameo in Men in Black II and appeared in The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, which Jones directed.

	During a 2006 interview with The New Yorker, Jones praised his daughter, who played a young Mexican girl in his film and was 14 at the time. “She's a good actress, has her SAG card, speaks impeccable Spanish,” he said. “When she was a baby, I told Leticia, her nurse, to speak to her in Spanish.”

	











	He also recalled firing Victoria at the time, after she had trouble with the early morning set times as a kid. “She had to get up at 5 A.M. for her part. One morning, she wouldn't get out of bed. I said, ‘Honey, this is work.' But she wouldn't budge. So I fired her,” he said. “Then, without telling me, the production staff went over and woke her and rushed her out to the set just in time.”

Home - Science - Forget flying saucers and friendly messages: the first alien civilization we detect could be “screaming” across the cosmos

When people imagine first contact with aliens, they often picture giant ships in the sky or wise beings sending peaceful messages. A new scientific idea suggests something very different. According to astrophysicist David Kipping of Columbia University, the first extraterrestrial civilization we detect is most likely to be an extreme, unstable and very “loud” one, possibly caught in a crisis at the end of its history rather than at its calm peak.

Kipping calls this idea the “Eschatian Hypothesis”. The name comes from “eschatos”, a Greek word for “last” or “final”. The basic claim is simple to state, even if the math behind it is more technical. The first alien technosignature we pick up is unlikely to come from a typical, steady society. Instead, it will probably come from a rare civilization that briefly becomes incredibly bright in some way, either by accident or by design.

To understand why, Kipping looks back at how astronomy usually works. Our first discoveries are often the oddballs, not the average cases. The very first confirmed exoplanets were found in the early 1990s orbiting pulsars, a type of dead, spinning star that behaves like a cosmic lighthouse. Today we know that exoplanets around pulsars are extremely uncommon, yet they showed up first because the timing signal was so sharp that tiny changes were easy to spot.

Something similar happened with so called hot Jupiters, giant planets hugging very close to their stars. Before the year 2000, a large fraction of known exoplanets fell into this category. Now we know hot Jupiters orbit less than one percent of Sun-like stars. They dominated early discoveries simply because they were easier to detect, not because they were normal.

The night sky teaches the same lesson. Roughly a third of the stars you can see with the naked eye are swollen giant stars, even though only a small fraction of all stars are in that brief, late phase of their lives. Supernovae are another example. A galaxy like the Milky Way only gets about two per century, yet modern surveys see thousands every year because they are so bright.

Kipping argues that technosignatures from alien civilizations will follow the same pattern. The loudest, strangest cases will stand out first. In his model, he splits civilizations into quiet and loud. Quiet societies radiate at a low, steady level for most of their lifetimes. Loud ones go through a short phase when their output in some detection channel spikes to extreme levels.

He then asks a simple question. If loud phases are rare and short, can they still dominate what we see? The answer is yes, if they are bright enough. Using a toy model, he shows that if a civilization is loud for only one-millionth of its lifetime, then that brief episode needs to be roughly ten thousand times brighter than its quiet state to be more likely to show up in our surveys.

In another example, if every society spends a tiny slice of its history in a loud phase, only about one percent of its total accessible energy budget has to be dumped into that window for such events to dominate detections.

What would make a civilization that loud? Here is where environmental science walks into the story. Kipping points out that technosignatures are, by definition, departures from natural equilibrium.

Other researchers have already suggested that human-driven climate change, ozone destroying chemicals and industrial air pollution could all act as technosignatures on a planetary scale. In other words, a world that is heating rapidly, with carbon levels and complex pollutants climbing in its atmosphere, might look very “loud” to a distant observer.

For our own species, Kipping notes that the brightest flash we could produce with current technology would likely be a global nuclear war, a completely unsustainable burst of energy. That kind of event would clearly be a terminal or near-terminal phase, not business as usual.

On the softer side, a planet wrapped in smog and greenhouse gases is also broadcasting a warning. From far away, it might be easier to notice the chemical scars of an overheating world than the quiet glow of a stable, low-impact society.

The “Eschatian Hypothesis” also changes how scientists think about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Instead of focusing only on narrow, long-term signals such as radio beacons, Kipping argues that we should lean into wide-field, high-cadence surveys that watch the sky continuously. Facilities like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, EvryScope and the Gaia alert stream are turning the sky into a time series, catching brief, odd flashes and unexplained transients.

Kipping suggests that search strategies should become more “agnostic”. In practice, that means looking for strange changes in brightness, spectrum or apparent motion that do not fit any known natural phenomenon, rather than chasing a single, predefined type of alien beacon. Efforts that hunt for anomalies of any kind could be our best route to spotting a civilization in its loud, unstable phase.

For readers used to thinking about energy bills, carbon footprints and planetary limits, the ecological twist is hard to ignore. If Kipping is right, the universe may be filled with mostly quiet worlds where civilizations either stayed sustainable or faded away quietly. The ones we notice first could be the unlucky few that push their planet into a dangerous state and light up the sky as they do it.

That raises an uncomfortable question. If someone out there is watching Earth right now, what kind of civilization do they think we are?

 This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here. 

Eric Neff's tenure at the Los Angeles County district attorney's office ended after he was placed on administrative leave in 2022 over accusations of misconduct in the prosecution of the CEO of Konnech, a software company that election conspiracy theorists said was in the thrall of the Chinese government.

Now, three years later, Neff is serving as one of the Trump administration's top election watchdogs.

Late last year , his name began appearing on lawsuits filed by the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, listed as “acting chief” of the voting section.

Neff's appointment, first reported by Mother Jones, has prompted renewed scrutiny of his work at the L.A. County district attorney's office.

The Times interviewed several of Neff's former colleagues, who revealed new details about claims of misconduct that emerged from the Konnech case, and said they were alarmed that someone with almost no background in federal election law was named to a senior position.

Neff led the 2022 investigation of Konnech, a tiny Michigan company whose software is used by election officials in several major cities. In a criminal complaint, Neff accused the company's CEO, Eugene Yu, of fraud and embezzlement, alleging the company stored poll worker information on a server based in China, a violation of its contract with the L.A. County registrar's office.

Six weeks after a complaint was filed,  prosecutors dropped the case and launched an investigation into “irregularities” and bias in the way evidence was presented against Konnech, the D.A.'s office said in a 2022 statement.

The county paid Konnech $5 million and joined a motion to find Yu factually innocent as part of a legal settlement.

The internal probe was focused on accusations that Neff misled supervisors at the district attorney's office about the role of election deniers in his investigation, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the case who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

Neff also allegedly withheld information about potential biases in the case from a grand jury, according to the two officials.

In a civil lawsuit filed last year, Neff said the internal review by the D.A.'s office cleared him of wrongdoing. The two officials familiar with the probe who spoke on the condition of anonymity disputed Neff's characterization of the findings.

A spokesman for Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman declined to comment or provide the results of the investigation into Neff, which the officials said was conducted by an outside law firm that generated a report on the case. Neff's attorney also did not provide a copy of the report.

A Department of Justice spokesman declined to comment.

Neff's attorney, Tom Yu — no relation to the Konnech CEO — said his client had no obligation to provide background information about the origins of the case to the grand jury.

Neff's appointment comes as President Trump continues to remake the DOJ in his own image by appointing political loyalists with no criminal law background as U.S. attorneys in New Jersey and Virginia and seeking prosecutions of his political enemies, such as former FBI Director James Comey.

Trump has never recanted his false claim that he won the 2020 election.

When then-L.A. County Dist. Atty. George Gascón announced the charges against Konnech in 2020, Trump said the progressive prosecutor would become a “National hero on the Right if he got to the bottom of this aspect of the Voting Fraud.”

The Konnech case was centered on contract fraud, not voter fraud or ballot rigging. Six weeks after the charges were filed, the case disintegrated.

The D.A.'s office cited Neff's over-reliance on evidence provided by True the Vote, the group that pushed the unfounded Chinese government conspiracies about Konnech and also appeared in a film that spread claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.

Gascón initially denied that True the Vote was involved in the case, but weeks later, a D.A.'s office spokesman said a report from the group's co-founder, Gregg Phillips, sparked the prosecution. Phillips testified in court in July 2022 that it was Neff who first contacted him about Konnech.

The two officials who spoke to The Times said that Neff withheld True the Vote's role from high-level D.A.'s office staff, including Gascón, when presenting the case.

Gascón declined an interview request, noting he is named in Neff's pending lawsuit, which is slated for trial in early 2026.

Neff's attorney insisted the case against Konnech was solid.

“He was let go because Trump tweeted a statement of ‘Go George Go',” the attorney said. “That's why Eugene Yu was let go. Because Gascón was so scared he was going to lose votes.”

Calls and emails to an attorney who previously represented Eugene Yu were not returned.

In his lawsuit, Neff claimed he had evidence that “Konnech used third-party contractors based in China and failed to abide by security procedures” to protect L.A. County poll worker data. The evidence was not attached as an exhibit in the lawsuit.

A DOJ spokesperson declined to describe Neff's job duties. His name appears on a number of lawsuits filed in recent months against states that have refused to turn over voter registration lists to the Trump administration.

Neff is also involved in a suit filed against the Fulton County clerk's office in Georgia seeking records related to the 2020 election, records show.

“We will not permit states to jeopardize the integrity and effectiveness of elections by refusing to abide by our federal elections laws,” Asst. Atty. Gen. Harmeet Dhillon, the California conservative who now leads the civil rights division, said in a recent statement.  “If states will not fulfill their duty to protect the integrity of the ballot, we will.”

Dhillon declined to comment through a DOJ spokesman.

The voting section “enforces the civil provisions of the federal laws that protect the right to vote, including the Voting Rights Act,” according to the DOJ's website.

It does not appear that Neff has any background working on cases related to federal election law. He first became an L.A. County prosecutor in 2013 and spent years handling local crime cases out of the Pomona courthouse. He was promoted and reassigned to the Public Integrity Division, which investigates corruption issues, in 2020, according to his lawsuit.

While there, he handled only two prosecutions related to elections. One was the Konnech case. The other involved allegations of election rigging against a Compton city council member.

In August 2021, Isaac Galvan, a Democrat, was charged with conspiring to commit election fraud after he allegedly worked to direct voters from outside his council district to cast ballots for him. Galvan won the race by just one vote, but was booted from office when a judge determined at least four improper ballots had been cast.

Galvan's criminal case is still pending; he recently pleaded guilty to charges in a separate corruption and bribery case in federal court. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles said there was no overlap between the D.A.'s election rigging case and the bribery case against Galvan. Federal prosecutors are not reviewing the Konnech case, the spokesman said.

Court filings show Neff was involved in Galvan's L.A. County case, but the prosecution was led by a more senior attorney.

Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School who served in the civil rights division during the Obama administration, said section chiefs normally have decades of experience in the area of law they're meant to supervise.

“The biggest problem with somebody with Neff's history is the giant screaming red flag that involves filing a prosecution based on unreliable evidence,” Levitt said. “That's not something any prosecutor should do.”

Neff's attorney, Yu, scoffed at the idea that his client was not experienced enough for his new role in the Trump administration, or that he was selected due to his involvement in the Konnech case.

“Eric got the job because he's qualified to get the job. He didn't get the job for any other reason. He got the job because he's an excellent advocate,” Yu said. “I think the Justice Department is very fortunate to have Eric.”

 The winter months stretch out before us, but Peacock has content worth staying inside for. True crime lovers can cozy up to stories of any kind of criminal they can imagine — ranging from those who are paying time for their crimes to ones still at large, leaving behind cold cases that have yet to be solved.


 From fictionalized versions of real events to deep dives into forensics to interviews with people on both sides of tragic transgressions, read on for EW's list of the 20 best true crime shows on Peacock.

 The strangest storyline on Grey's Anatomy took place off-screen. In 2022, Elisabeth Finch, a writer for the series, announced she was taking a leave of absence. For years, Finch had battled cancer — or so she said. As the public found out later, Finch's entire medical history was based on a lie, which she had used to advance her career and gain sympathy.


 The story of Finch's falsehood is now the subject of Peacock's documentary, Anatomy of Lies. A fascinating look at how one writer created her own alternate reality — and then used that reality to inform the lives and plot lines of the TV characters she wrote — Anatomy of Lies is a comprehensive portrait of how Finch's actions affected and devastated those around her. —Ilana Gordon

 Thanks to scientific and technological advancements, cold cases don't always stay cold. Such is the case on Bloodline Detectives, where law enforcement and forensic experts break down murders that were solved using genetic genealogy, or familial DNA (the same process police used to catch the Golden State Killer).


 Hosted by true crime aficionado and legal analyst Nancy Grace, Bloodline Detectives tracks the many ways experts use sites like Ancestry.com or 23andMe to crack dead-end cases. Featuring interviews with family members and investigators, Bloodline Detectives explains how old cases are solved using modern technology, even after all hope for a resolution has been lost. —Sammi Burke

 Adapted from the first season of Dr. Death, a podcast exploring outrageous instances of medical malpractice, this binge-worthy anthology series kicked off its first season with Joshua Jackson as Dr. Christopher Duntsch, a poorly-trained Texas neurosurgeon who maimed over 30 of his patients and killed two of them. Christian Slater and Alec Baldwin also star as Dr. Randall Kirby and Dr. Robert Henderson, both of whom caught on to Duntsch's botched procedures and lobbied to have his license revoked. 


 The bone-chilling depiction of Duntsch's possibly sociopathic rampage will succeed in keeping you on the edge of your seat — but side effects may include developing a fear of all doctor's appointments. The drama continues with a whole new story for the second season, starring Édgar Ramírez as thoracic surgeon Paolo Macchiarini. —S.B.

 If you enjoyed Dr. Death but are yearning for a more true-to-life account of the unbelievable true story, Peacock also produced a companion docuseries. Dr. Death: The Undoctored Story tells the tale of Christopher Duntsch's malpractice — and the subsequent fight to put a stop to his villainy — through reenactments, courtroom documents, and interviews with patients.


 It's rare to hear directly from survivors of true crime cases, so this series offers a unique opportunity to associate real humans with the horrors perpetrated. Laid out over four episodes, Dr. Death: The Undoctored Story ditches the drama and chronicles the story of Duntsch's actions, as told through the words and reflections of his former colleagues, his ex-girlfriend, his trial lawyers, and those who lived through his procedures. —S.B.

 Homicide is tragic, but it makes for good TV. Premiering during the summer of 2004 on A&E, The First 48 offers behind-the-scenes info into murder investigations, pulling back the curtain on the forensic tools, analysis, interviews, and other law enforcement techniques used to identify suspects and close cases. The show's title refers to the fact that the first 48 hours of an investigation are the most crucial in determining a case's chances of being solved, and to prove it, this docuseries focuses on homicide investigations of various lengths — from the cases detectives close quickly to the ones that take years to solve. As former EW writer Gillian Flynn writes in her 2004 review of the show, “48 flies by, but moments along the way linger.” —I.G.

 One of the most influential true crime docuseries, Forensic Files helped to develop our fascination with forensic evidence in solving criminal cases. First airing in 1996, the series centers on different forensic scientists every episode (though some analysts appear in multiple installments). Unlike shows such as Unsolved Mysteries, episodes of Forensic Files typically end with a sense of finality, with investigations having led to convictions or acquittals.


 The visual style of Forensic Files could later be seen in fictional crime dramas such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, as well as other docuseries. Peter Thomas narrated the series through 14 seasons. HLN rebooted the series as Forensic Files II in 2020. —K.J.

 The story of polygamist cult leader Warren Jeffs' ascent to power has received its fair share of media attention, but the four-episode docuseries Preaching Evil distinguishes itself by centering its point of view through the eyes of Naomie Jessop, Jeffs' once-favorite wife. Before his arrest, Jeffs led the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, where he took on multiple wives, including child brides and his late father's widows.


 Jeffs made the FBI's Most Wanted list, and while he was charged with sex crimes against minors in June 2005, he wasn't caught for another year. Over the course of one 48-minute episode, Jessop lays out the story of Jeffs' run from the law, which she personally documented in her role as his scribe. —S.B.

 Unsolved Mysteries remains one of the go-to documentary crime series, debuting decades before the true crime boom of the 2010s. Narrated by the iconic deep-voiced Robert Stack, the series explored the unexplainable, covering missing persons, cold cases, and even paranormal activity. With so many of these cases left unsolved, the show invited viewers to call in with any information they might have, with updates on solved cases sometimes provided in later episodes.


 The series has taken on new forms over the years, with a Netflix revival having dropped in 2020. But there was nothing quite like the original, in all its distinctly '90s glory. The first series, as well as the 2007–2010 Spike TV series hosted by Dennis Farina, are both available on Peacock. —K.J.

 When a mysterious stabbing in 2006 is reported to the D.C. police, they arrive on the scene to find the lifeless victim, Robert Wone, lying in the guest room. Oddly, there's minimal blood, displays of needle marks on Wone's neck, and an abnormal absence of struggle. Suspicions fall squarely on Wone's three friends — who invited him to stay overnight in their shared home and also claim an unknown intruder as the assailant — and what transpires is a multilayered, locked-room mystery that measures up to an Agatha Christie novel.

A newly invented cipher may shed light on how the mysterious Voynich manuscript was made in medieval times.

A unique cipher that uses playing cards and dice to turn languages into glyphs produces text eerily similar to the glyphs in the Voynich manuscript, a new study shows. The finding suggests that an equivalent cipher could have been used to create the mysterious medieval manuscript.

The new cipher — called ""Naibbe,"" from the name of a 14th-century Italian card game — does not decode the medieval Voynich manuscript, but it offers an idea for how the manuscript was made.

The Voynich manuscript, which has been radiocarbon-dated to the 15th century, contains roughly 38,000 words written in glyphs that have never been translated. Despite more than a century of intense scrutiny, the manuscript has not been explained conclusively. However, it continues to intrigue people, with its bizarre and inexplicable illustrations of plants, astrology and alchemy, including supposedly ""biological"" depictions of bathing naked women.

In the new study, published Nov. 26 in the journal Cryptologia, science journalist Michael Greshko investigated one way the manuscript may have come together. He told Live Science that he got the idea for the Naibbe cipher while researching stories about the Voynich manuscript. ""It is this fascinatingly mysterious medieval artifact,"" he said.

Naibbe first uses the number from the throw of a die to break a block of Italian or Latin into single and double letters — so ""gatto"" (Italian for ""cat"") could become ""g"",""at"" and ""to."" The cipher then uses the draw of a playing card to determine which of six different tables is used to encrypt the letters into ""Voynichese"" — the strange and undeciphered glyphs that are apparently grouped into words in the manuscript. The tables are ""weighted"" by the corresponding number of cards so that the statistical occurrence of the mock-Voynichese glyphs is the same as seen in the manuscript itself.

Greshko's effort is among the leading attempts to explain how the manuscript was made. But it still only approximated Voynichese text, rather than fully replicating it, he said.

The Voynich manuscript is named after the Polish, British and American book collector Wilfrid Voynich, who acquired it in 1912 from a collection compiled by a Jesuit college near Rome. It is now housed at Yale University.

The manuscript now lies at a nexus of attempts to understand lost languages, yet experts are not entirely sure if Voynichese is even real.

One theory, taken seriously, is that the manuscript is a medieval hoax, illustrated with suitably mysterious and salacious drawings, and that the text of Voynichese glyphs is completely meaningless.

The hoax theory has grown stronger in recent years as more attempts to decipher Voynichese — some of which have used machine learning and other computerized artificial intelligence methods — have failed to crack the code, if there is a code.

But theories that Voynichese is based on a real language and can be deciphered are still prominent, and Greshko's Naibbe cipher is one of the closest attempts yet.

The mock-Voynichese output of the Naibbe cipher has several important similarities to true Voynichese, including the statistical frequencies of glyphs, the length of Voynichese ""words,"" and certain rules of the manuscript's mysterious grammar.

Those commonalities suggested that a similar method was used to create the original Voynich manuscript, Greshko said. ""The Naibbe cipher is almost certainly not the way that the manuscript was constructed,"" he said. ""But what it does provide is a fully documented way to reliably go between Latin and something that behaves kind of like the Voynich manuscript.""

Dice and playing cards were chosen as sources of randomness because it was essential for the cipher to be ""hand-doable"" with the technology of the time, Greshko said. At one point, he thought of taking tokens from a bag — a bit like a bingo caller — but he realized that playing cards were known in Europe at that time.

And while the Naibbe cipher does not faithfully replicate all features of Voynichese — such as the exact incidence of Voynichese words and where they appear in a line or paragraph — the discrepancies could be analyzed for potential relevance, he said.

""My hope is that this becomes adopted as a computational benchmark,"" Greshko said. ""The points of difference between the cipher and the manuscript may point the way to how the text was actually created.""

Former satellite engineer René Zandbergen, a renowned expert on the Voynich manuscript who was not directly involved in Greshko's study, said he appreciated Greshko's efforts to create an encoding method to approximate Voynichese.

—How do we decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics and other ancient languages?

—AI is deciphering a 2,000-year-old 'lost book' describing life after Alexander the Great

—Mary, Queen of Scots' cryptic prison letters finally deciphered

But Greshko ""also makes it clear that he is not suggesting that this is how the manuscript text was generated,"" Zandbergen said in an email. ""He just demonstrates that such a method can be found, and we may assume that there may be others.""

Zandbergen added that he is ""essentially undecided"" about whether the Voynichese text is meaningful or a hoax.

""Some people argue that 'nobody would do that,' but I think that argument is too simplistic,"" he said. ""A more problematic point is that I find it very hard to imagine how it could have been done.""

Republicans cheer capture of Venezuelan leader, but Democrats say it ‘risks pulling our nation into another war'

Reaction to the capture of Nicolás Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela, by US forces on Saturday has been starkly polarized along political lines, with administration officials and Republicans celebrating the enforcement of a 2020 US narco-trafficking indictment against Maduro and Democrats decrying what they see as a violation of Venezuela's right to self-determination.

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said on X that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been indicted in the southern district of New York on charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the United States.

​The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, issued a statement: “Maduro is NOT the President of Venezuela and his regime is not the legitimate government. Maduro is the head of the Cartel de Los Soles, a narco-terror organization that has taken control of the country. And he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States.”

Many specialists are skeptical of the narco-terror description when it comes to Cartel de los Soles. Venezuela has a distinctly different landscape from Mexico when it comes to cartels.

But JD Vance, the US vice-president, said in a statement: “The president offered multiple off ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States. Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says. Kudos to our brave special operators who pulled off a truly impressive operation.”

Reaction from Democrats criticized the administration for transforming what had been an anti-narcotics trafficking operation in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, which included strikes against alleged drug boats, into a regime-change action.

US senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who serves as vice-chair of the Senate select committee on intelligence, said the US constitution “places the gravest decisions about the use of military force in the hands of Congress for a reason. Using military force to enact regime change demands the closest scrutiny, precisely because the consequences do not end with the initial strike.”

He added: “If the United States asserts the right to use military force to invade and capture foreign leaders it accuses of criminal conduct, what prevents China from claiming the same authority over Taiwan's leadership? What stops Vladimir Putin from asserting similar justification to abduct Ukraine's president? Once this line is crossed, the rules that restrain global chaos begin to collapse, and authoritarian regimes will be the first to exploit it.”

The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both Democrats, forcefully pushed back against the actions.

Hochul wrote on X that the strikes were “a flagrant abuse of power by acting without congressional approval”.

“New York is home to a vibrant Venezuelan community, and I stand with families here and abroad in their hopes for a better, more stable future,” Hochul added.

Ocasio-Cortez suggested that illegal drug trafficking was not the real motive for the attack. “It's not about drugs. If it was, Trump wouldn't have pardoned one of the largest narco traffickers in the world last month,” she wrote on X. “It's about oil and regime change.

“And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn't. Especially to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs,” Ocasio-Cortez added.

Congressman Gregory Meeks, a Democratic member of the House foreign affairs committee, said that Maduro was “an illegitimate leader” but “using the US military to attempt regime change in a sovereign foreign nation, without approval from Congress, without a defined objective or plan for the day after, and without support from our allies, risks entangling the United States in an open-ended conflict in Venezuela that could destabilize the entire region”.

The New Hampshire senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democratic member of the Senate foreign relations committee, said Maduro was “a tyrant who repressed Venezuelans and aligned with our adversaries” but “today's drastic military operation by President Trump on Venezuelan soil is entirely inconsistent with what [Trump's] cabinet repeatedly briefed to Congress and goes against the expressed wishes of the American people”.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is retiring from Congress next week, said on X she was “100% for strong safe secure borders and stopping narco terrorists and cartels from trafficking deadly drugs and human trafficking into America” but “if US military action and regime change in Venezuela was really about saving American lives from deadly drugs then why hasn't the Trump admin taken action against Mexican cartels?”

Greene pointed to the Trump-issued pardon of former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez as an example of a contradiction of the US president's policies, adding: “Americans' disgust with our own government's never ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going.”

New Jersey senator Andy Kim posted on X that Rubio and the US secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, “looked every Senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn't about regime change. I didn't trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress.”

Kim accused Trump of rejecting a “constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war”.

Kim, a former state department employee during the Obama administration, said the overnight attack in Venezuela “doesn't represent strength. It's not sound foreign policy. It puts Americans at risk in Venezuela and the region, and it sends a horrible and disturbing signal to other powerful leaders across the globe that targeting a head of state is an acceptable policy for the US government.”

California Democrat Ro Khanna accused Trump of betraying his Maga base by “launching a war of choice to bring regime change in Venezuela. We keep voting against dumb wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, & Libya. But our Presidents bow to a foreign policy blob committed to militarism.”

Khanna said the administration was getting the US “entangled in conflicts abroad, while ignoring the lack of good jobs and high costs for Americans at home. What will we say now if [Chinese president] Xi Jinping wants to capture [President] Lai [Ching-te] of Taiwan or Putin tries to capture Zelensky in Ukraine?”

He called “for a movement of the American people to stand against bloated defense budgets and warmongering. We need statesmen who will heed the advice of Washington and our founders and invest in jobs, healthcare, childcare & education for our people.”

Tiziano Breda, an analyst for Latin America at the global conflict monitor ACLED, said the US strikes targeting military facilities in Caracas, as well as sites in La Guaira, Aragua and Miranda, “stands out as the largest US military operation in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama”:

“The timing is not a coincidence – it appears to be aimed at undercutting the anniversary of Maduro's most recent term in office,” Breda said via email, warning that what happens next hinges on the response of Venezuela's government and armed forces.

“So far, they've avoided direct confrontation with US forces, but deployments on the streets point to efforts to contain unrest. A smooth transition remains unlikely, and the risk of resistance from pro-regime armed groups – including elements within the military and Colombian rebel networks active in the country – remains high.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The magnitude 6.5 earthquake shook the center and south of the country, which is one of the most seismically active in the world. The capital Mexico City and tourist hotspot Acapulco were affected.

A powerful earthquake struck central and southern Mexico on Friday, killing at least two people, officials said.

The magnitude 6.5 quake struck near the tourist hotspot of Acapulco, in Guerrero state on the Pacific coast.

The tremor was also felt around 400 kilometers (250 miles) away in the capital, Mexico City, where President Claudia Sheinbaum had to interrupt a press conference to evacuate the presidential palace.

The earthquake's epicenter was 14 kilometers outside of San Marcos, a town in the southwestern state of Guerrero, Mexico's National Seismological Service said.

Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado said a woman in her 50s was killed ""when her house collapsed on top of her.""

Around 50 houses in San Marcos were destroyed, Mayor Misael Lorenzo Castillo said, adding that ""all the houses have cracks.""

In the capital, a man in his 60s fell to his death while evacuating from his second-floor apartment in Mexico City, local authorities said.

Mexico City mayor Clara Brugada said 12 others were injured. 

Mexico's seismological service reported over 420 aftershocks by midday local time, with the strongest registered a magnitude 4.7.

Mexico is one of the world's most seismically active countries, as it is located between five tectonic plates.

In 1985, nearly 13,000 people died after an 8.1 magnitude earthquake hit Mexico City.

In 2017, a 7.1 magnitude quake left 369 people dead, mostly in the capital.

The US captured Nicolás Maduro in a military operation on Saturday, leaving Venezuela leaderless and with a potentially dangerous power vacuum.

Donald Trump confirmed that the US had “successfully carried out a large-scale strike” against Venezuela and its president, flying Mr Maduro and his wife out of the country.

The US leader hailed it a “brilliant operation” following “a lot of good planning”.

Early reports suggested there may have been some cooperation from Mr Maduro, who was seeking a deal with Mr Trump, but one never emerged.

Whether willingly or not, Mr Maduro is now out of his country and Venezuela could spiral into chaos.

It's unclear who will take his place, but here are some of the key players who could step in – either with the help of the US or by seizing power themselves.

The US recognises Edmundo González, who is widely seen as the winner of the disputed 2024 election, as Venezuela's president-elect.

After the election, the Maduro-aligned Venezuela's National Electoral Council declared Mr Maduro the winner within hours of the polls closing, but did not provide detailed vote counts.

The opposition coalition collected tally sheets from 80 per cent of the nation's electronic voting machines, which they said showed Mr González, a former diplomat, resoundingly won the election. Mr González, 76, fled to Spain amid concerns for his safety.

While the Biden administration said Mr González won the most votes, the Trump administration went further to declare Mr González the president-elect.

But while Mr González may appear the logical, democratic choice to step in to lead Venezuela, experts have warned chaos could ensue should he be installed as the new president unless the US is willing to deploy hundreds of thousands of troops and flood the country with food and resources.

The Venezuelan military operates as an “extractive economy”, where leaders rotate positions regularly and are given access to resources to enrich themselves, making it difficult for an outsider to control.

“The problem with the whole newly elected team is that if they come in, in an abrupt fashion, they will have no command and control of the military, no command and control of the police and zero intelligence structures, so they will be at a significant disadvantage”, Douglas Farah, the president of IBI Consultants and security consultant, told The Telegraph.

“I think in that scenario, the option of a sort of collapse into chaos because of the power vacuum is very high. Unless the United States come in with hundreds of thousands of troops behind them and food and the resources they need to reactivate the economy, it's just not a pretty picture because they won't have any levers of power except being there.”

He added: “If you came in and said, Okay, I'm now president, obey my orders, why? In exchange for what? And he has nothing to exchange.”

María Corina Machado is the real leader of the opposition and head of the Vente Venezuela party.

Ms Machado overwhelmingly won a 2023 presidential primary, clinching more than 90 per cent of the vote. But Ms Machado was blocked by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Tribunal of Justice from running for office.

The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize winner has been in hiding since 2024, but last month wrote a “freedom manifesto”, claiming her country is “at the edge of a new era” and claiming to have a plan for the first 100 hours and 100 days if Mr Maduro leaves.

“Everyone knows that he [Mr González] is only a stand-in for María Corina, so how they could make the transition in a democratic fashion without relying on simply anointment is really the challenge for them,” Mr Tinker Salas told The Telegraph.

He also warned that Ms Machado's popularity had been slipping because of her full-throated support of Mr Trump and US intervention.

Mr Farah said Ms Machado was a better-known figure who would be in a stronger position than Mr González to win the backing to survive in power, but he still doubts whether she would be able to avert the system descending into chaos.

“I think her claims to be able to ask for aid and for trying to build a consensus would be stronger just because she's a stronger personality and much more well-known and much more on the front lines.

“There's no question that she was who was really elected... I think everybody knew who they were voting for when they voted,” he said.

“She was the energy behind the campaign, she was the one who really kind of took him [Mr González] by the hand, and it was her energy and commitment and drive that really won the election,” Mr Gunson said.

“I don't think she would deny him or attempt to deny him the presidency, but she would be the power behind the throne,” he said.

Gladys McCormick, a history professor at Syracuse University, also warned that military chiefs may not be supportive of Ms Machado as they would be concerned she would come in an “exact retribution”.

During his conversation with the US president, Mr Maduro is said to have suggested his vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, run an interim government ahead of new elections.

Under the Venezuelan constitution, Ms Rodríguez, who has been Mr Maduro's second-in-command since 2018, should move into the presidential palace and hold elections within 30 days.

Ms Rodríguez, 56, who has held key government positions throughout Mr Maduro's regime and was Hugo Chavez's minister for presidential affairs, has been under US sanctions since 2018.

A group of Venezuelan officials led by Ms Rodríguez and her brother Jorge Rodríguez reportedly contacted Washington through Qatari back channels earlier this year to offer a “more acceptable” alternative to the Maduro regime.

The group offered “Madurismo without Maduro”, which could offer a peaceful transition in Venezuela and preserve stability, according to the Miami Herald. One proposal suggested Ms Rodríguez would serve as the institutional figure while retired general Miguel Rodríguez Torres, who is currently in exile, would lead a transitional government.

“She's not in the vice-presidency purely for decorative purposes,” Mr Gunson said. “She's very tough... she is very clever.”

“I'm not sure what her level of credibility would be among the great majority of the population,” Mr Tinker Salas said.

“She is the next in line in terms of a system of a transfer of power, but that would satisfy the Chavistas, I don't think it would satisfy the opposition,” he added.

Ms McCormick said she did not believe Ms Rodríguez had the “political acumen” or the strength to handle the chaos that would ensue following Mr Maduro's departure.

“She strikes me as somebody who has known how to accommodate to Maduro, which is part of the reason why she's there, but she doesn't sort of strike me as somebody who would sort of step into that political vacuum and take control,” she said.

Jorge Rodríguez, the vice-president's brother, is another key figure who could lead the Venezuelan government as part of a transition to democracy.

Mr Rodríguez, 60, is the president of the national assembly and Mr Maduro's chief negotiator who has led discussions with the US.

He has been a vocal critic of US intervention, warning a war would have “incalculable consequences” and ordered an investigation into US strikes on alleged drug boats.

Mr Rodríguez, a trained psychiatrist, was close to Mr Chávez, serving as his vice-president in 2007, and has also been under US sanctions since 2018.

“I think if they went to a softer transition, where they agreed to turn over power to the democratically elected government over a period of six months, in exchange for certain things, I think then you're probably looking at Jorge Rodriguez,” Mr Farah said.

“He has a lot of credibility internally,” he said.

Diosdado Cabello, Mr Maduro's minister of interior, justice and peace, would definitely not be the US-backed choice to lead Venezuela should Mr Maduro step down.

The US is currently offering a $25m (£18m) reward for information leading to his arrest. He is accused of running Cartel de Los Soles with Mr Maduro and was indicted in 2020 for alleged drug trafficking, among other crimes.

Following Saturday's strikes, Mr Cabello denounced the attack and called it “criminal and terrorist”, urging his country to remain calm.

“He has much more loyalty in the military than Maduro does, he's a former military person, he has a lot of street cred, if he wanted to stay and tough it out he would be the guy who's been involved in everything from the very beginning,” Mr Farah said.

“If you put Delcy, there's no guarantee she could actually move the military to give up anything down the road, whereas Diosdado Cabello... would be able to probably maintain some command and control and move things in a direction if he wanted, if he chose to do that.

“Whereas I think the rest of the inner circle, which has been sort of vultures and don't have the real credibility with the rank and file to do much more would have a much harder time actually negotiating any sort of change.”

Mr Farah added: “There are very few people who could keep things from fragmenting... someone like Diosdado Cabello, if he were able to be coerced on one side to not totally screw things up, could guarantee a transition out.”

Mr Gunson agreed that while Mr Cabello would unlikely win an election, he would have enough power and authority over the military and the police to maintain control.

“He would have a very strong case for saying ‘it has to be me, because only anyone who could avert chaos',” Mr Gunson said.

Vladimir Padrino López is another member of Mr Maduro's corrupt inner circle whom the US would likely see as an unpalatable successor.

Mr Padrino López is one of only a few officials to have spoken since the strikes, calling the attack an invasion that “represents the most blatant outrage suffered by the country”.

He also said Venezuela's armed forces would be deployed in line with “Maduro's orders”.

“They've attacked us, but they will not subdue us,” Mr Padrino López added, while calling for calm and unity.

The US is currently offering a $15m (£11m) reward for any information that leads to Mr Padrino López's arrest.

But despite this Mr Padrino López, who has been Mr Maduro's minister of defence since 2014, could be a potential contender to lead the transition government as he has considerable power and influence.

“He is a real player,” Mr Farah said.

“He would be much less acceptable to the outside world, but he would have command and control of the military and their economic establishment to guarantee that people have something to live on as the transition happened, so I would say Padrino López would also be a possibility,” he added.

“He has the support of all the military generals,” Mr Tinker Salas said, noting that the opposition leaders would likely never agree to his interim leadership.

“The interesting thing is that many of these operations in the US began were psycho operations looking for fractures or cracks within the military, those have not surfaced,” he said.

The Iranian government has formally demanded action from the United Nations following a series of increasingly bellicose statements from US President Donald Trump, including a claim that Washington is poised to intervene in the ongoing unrest in the Islamic Republic.

In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday, Iranian Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani accused Trump of “incitement to violence, unrest, and terrorist acts” within Iran.

“The President of the United States openly threatened the Islamic Republic of Iran with the use of force and intervention, declaring that ‘We are locked and loaded and ready to go,'” he wrote.

“These repeated and deliberate statements demonstrate a consistent pattern of unlawful conduct by the United States,” the letter reads, further detailing a long history of alleged US interference in Iranian affairs, including the 1953 coup, support for Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq War, the downing of Iran Air Flight 655, and the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani six years ago.

Large-scale protests erupted in Iran in late December, initially sparked by economic hardship, including the national currency hitting a new low. Demonstrations have spread and become increasingly violent; protesters have attacked  government buildings and clashed with security forces.

Several casualties have also been reported among both the protesters and the security forces.

Trump claimed in a post on Truth Social on Friday that if Iran “shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters,” the US would “come to their rescue.”

This prompted a warning from Iranian parliament speaker Mohammad Ghalibaf, who stated on X that US forces in the Middle East would be considered “legitimate targets” should Washington intervene.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has acknowledged the right of citizens to demonstrate peacefully, but emphasized that acts of violence during the protests, as well as foreign interference, will not be tolerated.

“The Great People of Iran will forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs,” Araghchi wrote on X. “Similarly, our Powerful Armed Forces are on standby and know exactly where to aim in the event of any infringement of Iranian sovereignty.”

The Iranian ambassador's letter to the UN calls on the Security Council to “unequivocally and strongly condemn these reckless and provocative statements” and demands the US comply with international law, ceasing “all threats or uses of force.”

US President Donald Trump on Friday said Washington was “locked and loaded” to respond if Iran killed protesters, prompting Tehran to warn that intervention would destabilize the region.

Protesters and security forces on Thursday clashed in several Iranian cities, with six people reported killed, the first deaths since the unrest escalated.

Shopkeepers in Tehran on Sunday last week went on strike over high prices and economic stagnation, actions that have since spread into a protest movement that has swept into other parts of the country.

If Iran “violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,” Trump wrote on social media. 

“We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” he added.

Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi called Trump's remarks “reckless and dangerous” and warned that the armed forces were “on standby” in the event of any intervention.

Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani warned Trump that “US interference in this internal matter would mean destabilizing the entire region and destroying America's interests.”

The American people “should be mindful of their soldiers' safety,” Larijani added.

Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said any US intervention would “be exposed to a response,” calling Iran's security a “red line.”

Iranian leaders said that peaceful protests over Iran's dire economy were legitimate and understandable.

The country's economy has been battered by years of crushing international sanctions over its nuclear program, with raging inflation and a collapsing currency.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said that from a religious perspective, he and his government would be damned to hell if they failed to address the people's economic hardship.

Officials have warned of a firm response to any instability.

An Iranian police spokesman said the authorities acknowledged that the protests “express the will of the people to improve their living conditions.”

“The police clearly distinguish between the legitimate demands of the people and destructive actions... and will not permit any enemies to transform the unrest into chaos,” they added.

The prosecutor of the district of Lorestan, where the clashes took place, was quoted on the judiciary's Mizan Web site as saying: “Any participation in illegal gatherings and any action aimed at disturbing public order, destroying property, disobeying law enforcement, inciting illegal gatherings... will be treated with the greatest firmness.”

“The United States should prepare itself because Donald Trump will fall seriously ill,” Juan de Dios Garcia proclaimed as he gathered with other shamans on a beach in southern Lima, dressed in traditional Andean ponchos and headdresses, and sprinkling flowers on the sand.
The shamans carried large posters of world leaders, over which they crossed swords and burned incense, some of which they stomped on.

The Central African Republic held relatively peaceful elections on December 28, widely seen as a test for President Touadera's decade in power. But can the country entrench stability and deliver economic transformation?

As voters in the Central African Republic await results of the December 28 elections, attention is already turning to how the country can consolidate security gains and transition into economic recovery. 

Incumbent President Faustin-Archange Touadera, 68, seeking a third term, is widely tipped for victory following constitutional changes in 2023 that removed term limits. The vote, which African Union (AU) observers described as ""step forward towards democracy,"" took place against a backdrop of a fragile economy and a complex regional geopolitical landscape. 

Beverly Ochieng, senior analyst at Control Risks in Senegal, told DW that President Touadera's dominance partly stems from his long tenure, and changing the constitution to consolidate his power.

She added Touadera does have a record over the last 10 years ""of trying to push for peace across the country whether through peace agreements with various rebel groups or even paramilitaries."" 

In an exclusive interview with DW, President Touadera said his record speaks for itself.

""Take a look at the situation in 2016 when I took office. There was no state authority throughout the country. You couldn't go out without an escort,"" he said, adding: ""Our defense forces were completely non-existent. Today, we see a country that is gradually recovering, that is raising its head."" 

During the last election, in 2020, only 50% of sub-prefectures were able to host polling normally, and the election was disrupted an attempted coup by rebels from the Coalition of Patriots for Change (CPC).

Analysts agree that CAR is far more secure than it was a decade ago. 

""Let us not forget in December 2020 there were rebels literally at the doors of Bangui, and the situation has changed,"" said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa Director at Human Rights Watch. 

Mudge credits several factors: ""The bilateral agreements he's made with Russia and Rwanda, the UN peacekeeping force, but probably most importantly are these peace deals that he's signed recently with three main rebel groups over the last few months.""

Ochieng adds: ""10 years ago at the point when Touadera and various other candidates were seeking election, state presence was very minimal outside of Bangui and there has been progress even, though there have been various setbacks.""

Touadera himself emphasizes the role of international partners and bilateral allies.

""We have gone from 5,000 armed forces personnel to more than 23,000 on the ground today,"" he told DW, adding that Central African troops now operate alongside international partners, including the UN mission MINUSCA (Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic). 

Still, insecurity persists in areas such as Haut-Mbomou, which is in the far east of the country, bordering on the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. Touadera points to disarmament efforts as evidence of progress: ""We had identified 14 armed groups. Today, 11 armed groups have declared their self-dissolution."" 

Despite these gains, critics warn that CAR's reliance on foreign support — particularly from Russia — could narrow political space. 

""The fight for peace and security is not over,"" Touadera told thousands of supporters in Bangui during his campaign, pledging to strengthen the armed forces to preserve national unity. 

CAR remains one of the poorest countries in the world, and pressure is mounting on the government to deliver economic reforms. 

In fact, analyst Beverly Ochieng tells DW that despite consolidated security efforts, ""without inclusion, it will be difficult for there to be much economic gain.""

Touadera's main rival, Anicet-Georges Dologuele, who was defeated in 2016 and 2020, made the economy the centerpiece of his campaign.

""We no longer have an economy. What kind of country is this that produces nothing, that exports nothing?"" Dologuele told DW. 

He described the vote as: ""A choice for national survival; a choice between resignation and hope.""

Analysts agree that gaining security is fundamental for economic progress. 

""You can't even have these conversations about the economy unless the country is secure,"" Mudge told DW. 

In Bangui, young people expressed both frustration and cautious optimism. 

Brunel, a trainee jewelry maker, said: ""Our concern is first of all to have stability so the authorities can create favorable conditions for the sons and daughters of the country to work."" 

At the University of Bangui, student Leslie Monika called for education reform: ""I would like the Ministry of Education to bring more rigor to fight corruption, and to truly value education."" 

For metalworker Icome Ikar, security and jobs go hand in hand: ""If the country is secure, we will be able to work properly and feed our families."" 

Analyst Lewis Mudge acknowledges Touadera has attempted to bring prosperity to the CAR: ""You do have a president who is trying everything he possibly can to try to generate some type of investment, some type of interest in growth in this country. But none of that is going to come without a meaningful sense of security.""

Craig was one of the last remaining elephants identified as super tuskers in Africa, but also became a symbol for conservation. 

Kenya is mourning the death of Craig, one of its most famous elephants, known for his massive ground-sweeping tusks. He died of natural causes at the age of 54.

""Early this morning, Amboseli National Park, Kenya — and indeed the world  lost a true icon. Craig, the legendary super tusker famed for its immense, ground-sweeping tusks and calm, dignified presence, passed on at the age of 54,"" the Kenya Wildlife Service reported on Saturday.

Craig was not only a major draw for tourists and conservationists but also a symbol of successful conservation efforts. He often paused patiently for visitors to film him.

Super tuskers are rare bull elephants with tusks weighing over 45 kilograms each, which also makes them a prime target for poachers.

Craig became a symbol of successful conservation efforts in East Africa, with Kenya reporting a rise in elephant numbers from about 36,000 in 2021 to over 42,000 today.

""His long life and survival to such maturity were made possible through decades of dedicated protection by Kenya Wildlife Service, working in close collaboration with conservation partners and the local community,"" the wildlife service said.

""Continuous monitoring, anti-poaching efforts, habitat protection, and community stewardship ensured that Craig lived freely and safely, demonstrating what collective commitment to wildlife conservation can achieve,"" it added.

The elephant was adopted by beer maker East African Breweries through its popular Tusker brand, reflecting his prominence but also underscoring collaboration between conservation groups and others in Kenya.

Craig fathered many calves, ""ensuring that his powerful bloodline and gentle character live on across generations.""

Lawmakers urge an emergency War Powers vote as Trump threatens more illegal attacks and US control of Venezuela.

Members of the U.S. Congress on Saturday demanded emergency legislative action to prevent the Trump administration from taking further military action in Venezuela after the president threatened a “second wave” of attacks and said the U.S. will control the South American country's government indefinitely.

Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), said that “Congress should vote immediately on a War Powers Resolution to stop” President Donald Trump, whose administration has for months unlawfully bombed boats in international waters and threatened a direct military assault on Venezuela without lawmakers' approval.

“Trump has no right to take us to war with Venezuela. This is reckless and illegal,” said Casar. “My entire life, politicians have been sending other people's kids to die in reckless regime change wars. Enough. No new wars.”

Another prominent CPC member, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), said in response to the bombing of Venezuela and capture of its president that “these are the actions of a rogue state.”

“Trump's illegal and unprovoked bombing of Venezuela and kidnapping of its president are grave violations of international law and the U.S. Constitution,” Tlaib wrote on social media. “The American people do not want another regime change war abroad.”

Progressives weren't alone in criticizing the administration's unauthorized military action in Venezuela. Establishment Democrats, including Sen. Adam Schiff of California and others, also called for urgent congressional action in the face of Trump's latest unlawful bombing campaign.

“Without congressional approval or the buy-in of the public, Trump risks plunging a hemisphere into chaos and has broken his promise to end wars instead of starting them,” Schiff said in a statement. “Congress must bring up a new War Powers Resolution and reassert its power to authorize force or to refuse to do so. We must speak for the American people who profoundly reject being dragged into new wars.”

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said he will force a Senate vote next week on a bipartisan War Powers Resolution to block additional U.S. military action in Venezuela.

“Where will this go next?” Kaine asked in a statement. “Will the president deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies? Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people's elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk.”

“It is long past time for Congress to reassert its critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy, and trade,” Kaine added. “My bipartisan resolution stipulating that we should not be at war with Venezuela absent a clear congressional authorization will come up for a vote next week.”

The lawmakers' push for legislative action came as Trump clearly indicated that his administration isn't done intervening in Venezuela's internal politics — and plans to exploit the country's vast oil reserves.

During a press conference on Saturday, Trump said that the U.S. “is going to run” Venezuela, signaling the possibility of a troop deployment.

“We're not afraid of boots on the ground,” the president said in response to a reporter's question, adding vaguely that his administration is “designating various people” to run the government.

Whether the GOP-controlled Congress acts to constrain the Trump administration will depend on support from Republicans, who have largely applauded the U.S. attack on Venezuela and capture of Maduro. In separate statements, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) described the operation as “decisive” and justified.

Ahead of Saturday's assault, the Republican-controlled Congress rejected War Powers Resolutions aimed at preventing Trump from launching a war on Venezuela without lawmakers' approval.

One Republican lawmaker who had raised constitutional concerns about Saturday's actions, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, appeared to drop them after a phone call with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

But Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ) noted in a statement that both Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “looked every senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn't about regime change.”

“I didn't trust them then, and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” said Kim. “Trump rejected our constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","‘Wicked' composer says he won't appear at Kennedy Center after name change","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/02/politics/wicked-composer-kennedy-center-trump","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 01:57:00 GMT","


            “Wicked” composer Stephen Schwartz says he will not appear at the Kennedy Center after its board voted to attach President Donald Trump's name to the venue — becoming the latest artist to push back against the president's takeover of Washington's most iconic performing arts center.
    


            The Oscar and Grammy-award winning composer said in a statement, “The Kennedy Center was founded to be an apolitical home for artists of all nationalities and all ideologies. It is no longer apolitical, and appearing there has become an ideological statement. As long as that remains the case, I will not appear there.”
    


            The center's website had listed Schwartz as appearing in a gala with the Washington National Opera in May, and included a link to buy tickets to the performance, but it was removed from the website Friday afternoon.
    


            In spite of the website listing the upcoming appearance by Schwartz, Richard Grenell, the president of the center's board, denied that he had ever been signed to appear.
    


            “He was never signed and I've never had a single conversation on him since arriving,” Grenell said in a post on X, calling reports of Schwartz's cancelation “totally bogus.”
    


            “He himself said last February he hadn't heard anything on it,” Grenell said.
    


            A spokesman for Schwartz said the composer and a person associated with the Washington National Opera had been in communication about his “possible participation” in a May gala, and they had last spoken in February 2025.
    


            “Having not heard anything further after that point, he assumed—incorrectly, as it turns out—that the event was no longer moving forward,” the spokesman, Michael Cole, said in an email to CNN. Cole added that Schwartz had only learned Thursday night that the event was still scheduled.
    


            The Kennedy Center opened in 1971, designated by Congress as a living memorial to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy. Schwartz attended the center's opening.
    


            But a stream of artists have canceled their appearances since Trump purged the center's existing board and installed a slate of loyalists to oversee the center last year. Since then, the center has cut staff and reevaluated its programming.
    


More artists canceled after the new board voted last month to rename the center “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”
    


            The New York City-based dance company Doug Varone and Dancers is among those who cancelled their upcoming performances. The company's director, Doug Varone, appearing on CNN's “Erin Burnett OutFront” on Friday said the decision to cancel was unanimous — despite the financial hit from lost revenue.
    


            “Everyone in our organization from our board to our dancers to our staff all supported this decision,” he said. “I can't imagine any artist wanting to step through those doors right now with his name on that building.”
    


            The decision by artists to bow out of scheduled appearances prompted threats of legal action from the Kennedy Center against some of the artists.
    


            The move to add Trump's name to the center quickly raised legal concerns as to whether the board had the legal authority to rename the arts institution. But it's unclear whether anybody looking to challenge the renaming would have legal standing to do so, experts previously told CNN.

It turns out, love may benefit from a little less labor.

Couples who spend money on time-saving services — like getting takeout, hiring a housecleaner or calling a dog walker — report greater relationship satisfaction, especially during stressful periods, says Ashley Whillans, a behavioral scientist and professor at Harvard Business School.

Whillans studies the “tradeoffs people make between time and money.”

“When you spend money to save time — hiring an accountant, a babysitter, a cleaner — you feel more control over your life,” she said. “That sense of autonomy boosts well-being.”

Not everyone can afford to outsource bigger household chores. But Whillans says even a little bit can help. She advises couples to take a “time audit” — examining how they spend their hours and what small changes could reclaim even a few moments.

“People underestimate how much these choices matter,” she said. “It's not about luxury — it's about freeing up time to connect.”

Whillans' team tracked busy, dual-income couples — partners working full-time who often report feeling time-starved — and found consistent patterns. In one six-week diary study, couples who made “time-saving purchases” on a given day were happier and more satisfied with their relationships.




Simply outsourcing chores isn't a magic fix, however.

“It's about being intentional with the time you get back — using it to spend quality time together, to reconnect,” Whillans said.

“Think of that half hour not as an opportunity to send more emails, but as a chance to spend time with your partner.”

Targol Hasankhani, a Chicago-based marriage and family therapist, stressed that while outsourcing domestic labor can ease daily stress, it doesn't replace communication. Juggling careers and kids takes a toll on families, and housework is often freighted with resentments over who is doing it.

“If conflict around chores is rooted in something deeper — like inequity or not feeling heard — hiring a cleaner won't solve that,” she said. 

Couples must dig deeper to address problems with many layers.

“It opens up time and space, but couples still have to know how to show up for each other in that space,” Hasankhani said.

Casey Mulligan Walsh, 71, a former speech pathologist and author in upstate New York, said the best part about hiring a housecleaner once a week was that it freed up time for her and her husband to spend together.

“My favorite day of the week was coming home to a clean house,” she said. “We'd go get coffee together instead of arguing about who should vacuum.”

Getting started on delegating household tasks isn't easy for some couples, Whillans said. Besides the cost, “it takes time to find someone and coordinate — but the long-term payoff is real.”

And making such decisions together can deepen trust and a sense of teamwork.

For one Colorado couple, outsourcing started as an act of love.

“When I started dating, my now-husband noticed how hard I was working — at my job, at home and as a single mom,” said Melissa Jones, a 45-year-old teacher in Pueblo. 

His Valentine's Day gift? A deep housecleaning.

“It was truly amazing,” Jones said. “After that, I kept it up on my own for years. When my husband and I moved in together, we decided to continue.”

“We're able to make memories with each other, our kids and our families instead of spending weekends scrubbing floors,” she said.

In Miami, Elizabeth Willard, 59, runs The Pickled Beet, a culinary service preparing customized meals. 

“Most of the people I cook for are trying to invest in their health but don't have the time,” she said, noting that families often juggle mixed dietary needs. “Sometimes the husband's a carnivore and the wife's vegetarian, one child's celiac. They're exhausted trying to make everyone happy.”

Her clients, often families with children and two working parents, are “not fighting over what's for dinner. It's one less daily decision.”

Whether ordering a pizza, paying a teenager to mow the lawn, or calling a car service to save 20 minutes, the outcome can be the same: Buying back time can buy peace.

Venezuela opposition leader María Corina Machado called Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro the head of a 'criminal structure' on 'Fox & Friends Weekend' in November 2025.

Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado issued an open call for a transfer of power Saturday, urging the military to abandon Nicolás Maduro's government and recognize opposition-backed candidate Edmundo González as president after the U.S. said Maduro had been captured.

Machado's statement came hours after President Donald Trump announced that U.S. forces had captured Maduro following what he described as ""large-scale"" military strikes targeting the Venezuelan government. Trump said Maduro and his wife were flown out of the country, a move that would mark the most direct U.S. military action against a Latin American head of state in decades.

""The hour of freedom has arrived,"" wrote in a post on X. ""This is the hour of the citizens. Those of us who risked everything for democracy on July 28th. Those of us who elected Edmundo González Urrutia as the legitimate President of Venezuela, who must immediately assume his constitutional mandate and be recognized as Commander-in-Chief of the National Armed Forces by all the officers and soldiers who comprise it.""

It remained unclear Saturday whether senior commanders have shifted allegiance or whether the opposition has secured control of state institutions.

Machado also called on Venezuelans inside the country to remain ""vigilant, active and organized,"" signaling that further instructions would be communicated through official opposition channels. To Venezuelans abroad, she urged immediate mobilization to pressure foreign governments to recognize a new leadership in Caracas.

The U.S. conducted strikes on Caracas early Saturday morning and took Maduro and his wife into custody and flew them to New York to face drug trafficking charges.

Machado and González have repeatedly argued that the July 28 presidential election was stolen, pointing to an opposition-run parallel vote count that they say shows González won by a wide margin.

Venezuela's electoral authorities, which are controlled by Maduro allies, declared him the winner with just under 52% of the vote, compared with roughly 43% for González. The government has rejected allegations of fraud.

The opposition, however, says it collected and published tally sheets from polling stations nationwide showing González received about two-thirds of the vote, compared with roughly 30% for Maduro — a claim cited by several foreign governments that declined to recognize the official results.

Maduro's government has refused to release detailed precinct-level data to independently verify the outcome, further fueling accusations that the election did not reflect the will of voters.

While González is the opposition-backed presidential candidate, Machado has remained the dominant figure in Venezuela's opposition movement. Machado won the opposition's primary by a landslide before being barred from running by Maduro's government, forcing the coalition to rally behind González as a substitute candidate.

Throughout the campaign, González publicly acknowledged Machado as the movement's leader, with Machado continuing to direct strategy, messaging and voter mobilization efforts. Machado has remained the public face of the opposition, while González has largely played a formal, constitutional role tied to the presidency.

President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military carried out a ""large-scale strike"" in Venezuela early Saturday morning and took Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife into custody.

Covered by: Rachel Wolf, Michael Sinkewicz, Lucas Tomlinson , Michael Dorgan, Elizabeth Elkind, Alex Miller, Amanda Macias and Jasmine Baehr

President Donald Trump
 announced that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife have been captured and flown out of the country after the U.S. carried out a ""large scale strike."" Trump is expected to address the nation at 11 a.m. ET from Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla.

The U.S. military has carried out a series of strikes on suspected drug vessels allegedly tied to the Venezuelan regime in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific. The CIA carried out a strike in late December against a dock area inside Venezuela that U.S. officials said was used by drug cartels to load narcotics onto boats.

The U.S. government had offered a 
$50 million bounty for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Maduro. After Saturday's early-morning operation, Venezuela's vice president has demanded proof of life.

President Donald Trump released photos Saturday afternoon showing himself and senior members of his cabinet monitoring the early-morning U.S. military operation in Venezuela from Mar-a-Lago.

The images, posted to Trump's Truth Social account, show Trump seated at a long table alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, with aides and security personnel standing nearby. Computer screens and communications equipment appear visible in several shots.


The photos were taken in the early hours of Saturday morning as U.S. forces carried out what he described as a “large-scale strike” in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.

The images offer a rare behind-the-scenes look at Trump and his national security team tracking the operation in real time from Florida.





As Americans awoke to the news of U.S. military strikes on Venezuela, and the capture and extraction of Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, questions are being asked if Maduro was betrayed by someone from his secretive inner circle. 

That inner circle includes Diosdado Cabello, who currently holds the role of minister of interior, justice, and peace, is widely believed to be as powerful as Maduro.


Another member of that inner circle is Vladimir Padrino, the longstanding head of the nation's Armed Forces, who wields enormous power. Both Cabello and Padrino quickly condemned U.S. actions, but their responses so far have rung hollow.

Cabello now stands as the undisputed heir to the Chavista movement, with Padrino and the nation's military muscle seemingly in lockstep, yet the Venezuelan Armed Forces seemingly put up no resistance of any kind to the operation.

In an early morning video shared on X, Padrino lambasted the ""criminal military aggression by the government of the United States…coming to strike with their missiles and rockets fired from combat helicopters in Fuerte Tuna, Caracas, and the states of Mirana, Aragua, and La Guaira.


""He repeated decades-old Hugo Chavez talking points, stating, ""Venezuela rejects with all its strength the presence of these foreign troops which have only brought death, pain and destruction. This invasion represents the greatest tragedy that the country has suffered, which is motivated by an insatiable greed for our strategic resources.""

With a $50 million bounty on Maduro's head, considerable domestic unpopularity, and the disputed 2024 election which the international community widely discredited as stolen, the writing appeared on the wall for Nicolas Maduro for years.

Now, Maduro and Flores are reportedly guests of the United States government on the warship Iwo Jima, bound for New York to face what is likely to be the trial of the decade. Maduro is facing weapons and drug charges.

This is an excerpt of an article by Fox News Digital's David Unsworth.



Chevron has operated in Venezuela for roughly a century (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)



Chevron, the only remaining U.S. oil company operating in Venezuela
, said it continues to run its limited operations in “full compliance” with all applicable laws following the predawn capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

“We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,” a Chevron spokesperson wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital.

The company emphasized that its priority remains the safety and wellbeing of its employees and the integrity of its assets, declining to comment on the broader security environment in Venezuela as the political situation rapidly evolves.

Chevron has maintained a constrained presence in the country through joint ventures with the state-run oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), after other U.S. energy firms exited amid nationalization efforts, sanctions and political instability.

President Donald Trump said U.S. energy companies could play a central role in rebuilding the country's oil sector. He added that the United States continues to enforce its embargo on Venezuelan oil.



Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.



Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., warned that President Donald Trump's announcement that the U.S. would run Venezuela should cause alarm among Americans. 

Trump during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago told reporters that following strikes on Venezuela's capital Caracas, and the subsequent capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on Saturday that the U.S. would be running the country. 


“We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said. “So, we don't want to be involved with having somebody else get in and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years.”

But Schumer noted that moving ahead with the strikes and “without a credible plan for what comes next is reckless.” 

“The administration has assured me three separate times that it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela,” Schumer said. “Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans.”

“The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans,” he continued. “The American people have seen this before and paid the devastating price.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump both weighed in on why Congress wasn't notified of the strikes — Rubio warned it could have endangered Operation Absolute Resolve while Trump charged that lawmakers leak information.

Schumer demanded that the administration brief lawmakers on its objective in Venezuela immediately, and what plan Trump had to prevent a humanitarian and geopolitical disaster “that plunges us into another endless war or one that trades one corrupt dictator for another.""





Colombian President Gustavo Petro needs to watch his backside, according to President Donald Trump.


A reporter asked Trump whether Petro should be worried following the U.S. operation in Venezuela in which dictator Nicolás Maduro was captured.

""Well, he has cocaine mills. He has, factories where he makes cocaine, and. Yeah, I think I stick by my first statement. He's making cocaine. They're sending it into the United States. So he does have to watch his a--,"" Trump said.

Petro posted a lengthy condemnation of the U.S. operation in Venezuela, claiming it was carried out in violation of the United Nations charter, an argument made by other foreign leaders.



President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio




President Donald Trump offered a simple answer as to why lawmakers weren't notified ahead of Operation Absolute Resolve: Congress leaks. 

Several lawmakers are furious that they were not notified ahead of the surprise strikes, and subsequent capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on Saturday.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago told reporters that lawmakers weren't notified ahead of time out of concern that it could endanger the operation, but were called right after. He noted that “this is not the kind of mission that you can do congressional notification on; it was a trigger-based mission in which conditions had to be met night after night.”

“We watched and monitored that for a number of days,” Rubio said. “So, it's just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say, ‘hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days.'”

Trump interjected with a simpler explanation. 


“Congress has a tendency to leak,” Trump said. 

“This would not be good if they leaked, General, I think it would have been maybe a very different result,” he continued. “But I have to say they knew we were coming at some point, you know, we had a lot of ships out there, they sort of knew what we were. But Congress, Congress will leak and we don't want to leakers.""





Despite the historic U.S. operation leading to the capture of Nicolás Maduro, the embargo on Venezuelan oil has not been lifted, President Donald Trump
 announced on Saturday.

""The embargo on all Venezuelan oil remains in full effect. The American armada remains poised in position, and the United States retains all military options until the United States demands have been fully met and fully satisfied,"" the president said. ""All political and military figures in Venezuela should understand what happened to Maduro can happen to them.""

President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the U.S. had ""overwhelming evidence"" against Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.


""Maduro and his wife were soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil... But we have people where the overwhelming evidence of their crimes will be presented in a court of law. And I've seen it. I've seen what we have. It's both horrible and breathtaking that something like this could have been allowed to take place.""



Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez



Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., accused the Trump administration of running a smokescreen to hide the real reason that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured Saturday. 


“It's not about drugs,” Ocasio-Cortez said on X. “If it was, Trump wouldn't have pardoned one of the largest narco traffickers in the world last month.”

President Donald Trump's pardon last year of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández of a drug trafficking conviction was already a sticking point for several congressional Democrats and some Republicans, but Ocasio-Cortez and her colleagues have since argued that it's a point of hypocrisy by the administration in the wake of Maduro's extraction.


Trump and top officials have long accused Maduro of drug trafficking and working with cartels and gangs that have been designated as terrorist organizations. Over the last year, the administration has carried out several strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean in an effort to stymie the flow of drugs into the U.S. 

But Ocasio-Cortez argued that the Trump administration's motives were more sinister, and geared toward shifting the balance of power in Venezuela, along with pointing attention elsewhere from key issues in the U.S. 

“It's about oil and regime change,” she continued. “And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn't. Especially to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs.”

President Donald Trump said on Saturday that U.S. oil companies would spend ""billions"" to fix the oil infrastructure in Venezuela.

""As everyone knows, the oil business in Venezuela has been a bust. A total bust for a long period of time. They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been pumping and what could have taken place,"" Trump said.


""We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go and spend billions of dollars to fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.""

President Donald Trump said at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago that the United States will temporarily run Venezuela after the capture of Nicolás Maduro.


""We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,"" Trump said from his Palm Beach, Fla., residence. ""So we don't want to be involved with having somebody else get in. And we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years. So we are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition. And it has to be judicious because that's what we're all about. We want peace, liberty and justice for the great people of Venezuela, and that includes many from Venezuela that are now living in the United States and want to go back to their country. It's their homeland.""

President Donald Trump shared an image of Venezuela dictator Nicolás Maduro aboard the U.S.S. Iwo Jima.

The dictator appeared in a gray sweatsuit and was seemingly blindfolded and restrained. He was also holding a plastic water bottle.

Overnight, the U.S. carried out strikes in Venezuela and captured Maduro and his wife. The duo are on their way to New York where they will stand trial for criminal charges.



Screenshot of Johnson's statement



House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., backed President Donald Trump's decision to arrest Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife amid partisan praise and backlash for the early Saturday operation.

“Today's military action in Venezuela was a decisive and justified operation that will protect American lives,” Johnson said in a statement on X.


“Nicolas Maduro is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans after years of trafficking illegal drugs and violent cartel members into our country — crimes for which he's been properly indicted in U.S. courts and an arrest warrant duly issued — and today he learned what accountability looks like,” he continued.

Trump confirmed that Maduro and his wife were captured after strikes and taken from the country after strikes in Venezuela's capital Caracas. He's expected to address the nation on the operation at 11 a.m. Saturday.


Meanwhile, the strikes have driven yet another partisan wedge between the aisles in Washington, D.C. Johnson and congressional Republicans have largely come to bat for Trump and the administration. The speaker said the president's move “will no longer allow criminal regimes to profit from wreaking havoc and destruction on our country.”

And the speaker noted that lawmakers would soon be clued in on what happened over the weekend.“The Trump Administration is working to schedule briefings for Members as Congress returns to Washington next week,” Johnson said. “Our brave military personnel who executed a precise, successful operation deserve our gratitude and congratulations.”

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum condemned U.S. action in Venezuela, saying that it was carried out in violation of the United Nations Charter.

The Mexican president posted on X verbatim Article 2, Section 4 of the U.N. Charter, which reads ""All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.""

In a statement, the Mexican government called for ""respect for international law"" after the U.S. carried out strikes on Venezuela overnight and captured its leader Nicolás Maduro.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres was ""deeply alarmed"" after the U.S. carried out strikes in Venezuela and captured its leader Nicolás Maduro, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the Secretary-General, said in a statement to Fox News.


""Independently of the situation in Venezuela, these developments constitute a dangerous precedent. The Secretary-General continues to emphasize the importance of full respect - by all - of international law, including the UN Charter. He's deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected,"" Dujarric said. ""The Secretary-General calls on all actors in Venezuela to engage in inclusive dialogue, in full respect of human rights and the rule of law.""

The U.N. Security Council (UNSC) could possibly hold an emergency meeting on Saturday following the U.S. actions in Venezuela, Fox News has learned. Reports indicate that Venezuela could have demanded the meeting. Additionally, Russia, which condemned the U.S. strikes, publicly called for an ""immediate meeting"" of the UNSC.

President Donald Trump told ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" that Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and his wife were taken by helicopter to the U.S.S. Iwo Jima. The two were captured during an operation on Saturday morning in Caracas.

Fox News host Griff Jenkins asked Trump
, ""Before we let you go, though, can you tell us where Maduro and his wife are right this second?""

Well, they'll be heading to New York,"" Trump said. Griffin interjected, ""were they taken to a ship first?""

""Yes, the Iwo Jima,"" Trump said. ""They'll be heading into New York. The helicopters took them out, and they went by helicopter on a nice flight. I'm sure they loved it, but they've killed a lot of people.""

""Even people in their own country. They killed a lot of people to maintain power. He's a very vicious person.""

Earlier on Saturday, Trump confirmed on Truth Social that the U.S. carried out strikes in Caracas and captured both Maduro and his wife.

Fox News has learned that Maduro could make an appearance in federal court in New York, where he was indicted years ago, as soon as Monday.





Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) condemned 
U.S. strikes on Venezuela, saying that the U.S. carried out ""an act of armed aggression"" that ""gives rise to deep concern [and] warrants condemnation.""

""The pretexts used to justify these actions are untenable,"" the Russian MFA wrote in a post on X. ""Russia reaffirms its solidarity with the Venezuelan people.""

In a longer statement, Russia's MFA called for the prevention of further escalation and urged the U.S. and Venezuela ""to focus on finding a solution through dialogue."" The Kremlin added that ""Latin America must remain a zone of peace, as it proclaimed itself in 2014.""

This comes as the Trump administration has been attempting to negotiate peace in the nearly four-year-long Ukraine-Russia war. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 during the Biden administration.

President Donald Trump spoke with ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" on Saturday morning just hours after the U.S. hit Venezuela and captured its leader Nicolás Maduro.

The president said that he watched the operation from Mar-a-Lago.


""It's just it was an amazing thing, the amazing job that these people did. There's nobody else could have done anything like it,"" Trump said of the historic operation.

When asked about critics who have emerged in the hours since the strikes, Trump brushed it off, saying that they were ""weak, stupid people.""

Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro could make an initial appearance in federal court in Manhattan as soon as this coming Monday, Fox News is told.

The timing could change at this stage, but his appearance will happen ""likely Monday,"" Fox News learned.


President Donald Trump said the U.S. carried out a strike on Venezuela early Saturday and captured Maduro and his wife, who have been flown out of the country. Attorney General Pam Bondi reiterated that Maduro and his wife had already been indicted in the Southern District of New York.





Vice President JD Vance stood by President Donald Trump's decision to carry out strikes in Venezuela and to capture dictator Nicolás Maduro.

""The president offered multiple off ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States. Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says,"" Vance wrote on X.

""Kudos to our brave special operators who pulled off a truly impressive operation,"" he added.


The strikes on Venezuela and capture of Maduro have been praised and condemned across the globe. While some countries expressed concern that the move would lead to chaos in the region, others cheered on the U.S.





World leaders were sharply divided Saturday after the United States launched a large-scale strike on Venezuela and President Donald Trump announced that the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro, had been captured and flown out of the country.

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez condemned what he called a ""criminal attack,"" writing on X that, ""Our zone of peace is being brutally assaulted."" Communist Cuba is a supporter of the Maduro government and has been a longtime adversary of the United States.


Colombian President Gustavo Petro said his government viewed the reports coming out of Venezuela ""with deep concern,"" and he warned against further escalation, claiming the U.S. strikes risked destabilizing the region.

""The Colombian Government rejects any unilateral military action that could aggravate the situation or put the civilian population at risk,"" Petro wrote on X.

Meanwhile, President Javier Milei of Argentina, a close ally of Trump, praised the news by sharing a previous video of him denouncing Maduro's ""narco-terrorist"" regime as a regional threat and urging Latin American leaders to back U.S. pressure to end it.

""Long live freedom, dammit!"" Milei wrote, using his signature pro-freedom chant.



Miraflores Palace/Handout via Reuters



Days before he was captured by U.S. forces, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said that his government was open to negotiating an agreement with the U.S. aimed at fighting drug trafficking.


The pre-taped interview was staged with Maduro seated behind the wheel of a car and driving with Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet in the passenger seat while they discussed a potential deal. In the clip that aired on state TV, Maduro said Venezuela is ""ready"" to discuss a drug-trafficking deal with the U.S. He called on the countries to ""start talking seriously, with data in hand.""

""The U.S. government knows, because we've told many of their spokespeople, that if they want to seriously discuss an agreement to combat drug trafficking, we're ready,"" he said. ""If they want oil, Venezuela is ready for U.S. investment, like with Chevron, whenever they want it, wherever they want it and however they want it.""

Chevron Corp. is the only major U.S. oil company currently exporting Venezuelan crude to the United States.





Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., who was born in Cuba and serves on the House Armed Services Committee, praised the Trump administration for striking Venezuela and capturing Nicolás Maduro.

""President Trump has changed the course of history in our hemisphere. Our country and the world are safer for it,"" Gimenez wrote on X. ""Today's decisive action is this hemisphere's equivalent to the Fall of the Berlin Wall.""


""It's a big day in Florida, where the majority of Venezuelan, Cuban and Nicaraguan exiles reside. This is the community I represent & we are overwhelmed with emotion and hope,"" Gimenez added.





Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed Saturday that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores will face the ""full wrath of American justice"" following their capture by U.S. forces in Venezuela and extraction from the country.

In an X post, Bondi reiterated that Maduro and his wife had been indicted in the Southern District of New York.


""Nicholas Maduro has been charged with Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States. They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,"" Bondi wrote.

""On behalf of the entire U.S. DOJ, I would like to thank President Trump for having the courage to demand accountability on behalf of the American People, and a huge thank you to our brave military who conducted the incredible and highly successful mission to capture these two alleged international narco traffickers,"" she added.

According to the State Department's website, Maduro was charged in the Southern District of New York in 2020 for narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also reiterated on X that Maduro ""was indicted in U.S. court nearly six years ago for drug trafficking and narco-terrorism.""

""Nicolas Maduro wasn't just an illegitimate dictator; he also ran a vast drug-trafficking operation,"" Cotton wrote.

The senator added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that Maduro would ""face justice for his crimes against our citizens.""

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro reportedly made a statement on television and radio condemning the U.S.'s ""grave military aggression"" against his country.

Maduro reportedly said the U.S. strikes were carried out in violation of the United Nations Charter and that Washington put peace and stability at risk across Latin America and the Caribbean, according to The Miami Herald.


“This is an attack against the sovereignty of Venezuela,” Maduro reportedly said. 






Secretary of State Marco Rubio reposted a reminder that he long asserted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was not the legitimate president of the country.

""Maduro is the head of the Cartel de Los Soles, a narco-terror organization which has taken possession of a country. And he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States,"" Rubio wrote in a post on X in July that he reposted following Maduro's capture.

President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that the U.S. carried out overnight strikes in Venezuela and that Maduro had been ""captured and flown out of the country.""

Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez demanded in audio played on state TV that the U.S. provide ""proof of life"" for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.

""We demand that President Donald Trump's government provide immediate proof of life for President Maduro and the First Lady,"" Rodriguez said, according to Reuters.

In August, the U.S. announced a $50 million bounty for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Maduro.

President Donald Trump announced on Jan. 3 that the U.S. carried out overnight strikes in Venezuela and ""captured"" Maduro and his wife.





Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said on Saturday that he spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio after the U.S. carried out A major strike inside Venezuela.


Lee said Rubio told him the actions carried out in Venezuela were to protect U.S. personnel executing an arrest warrant for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The senator added that Rubio said Maduro is expected to stand trial in the U.S. on criminal charges.

""He anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in U.S. custody,"" Lee added in a subsequent post on X.

The Republican lawmaker announced his conversation with Rubio after  questioning the legality of the strikes in a previous post. However, after speaking with Rubio, Lee said he believed that ""this action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack.""

The U.S. military carried out a ""large-scale strike"" in Venezuela early Saturday morning and took Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife into custody, President Donald Trump confirmed.

The president wrote on Truth Social that the operation was successful and Maduro and his wife were ""captured and flown out of the country."" Trump said the operation was conducted with U.S. law enforcement and added that a news conference will take place at Mar-a-Lago at 11 a.m. on Saturday.

At least seven explosions could be heard in Venezuela's capital city of Caracas early Saturday morning, according to The Associated Press, and low-flying aircraft were seen flying over Caracas at about 2 a.m. local time.

The Venezuelan government said in a statement that ""the civilian and military localities of the city of Caracas, capital of the Republic, and the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira"" were impacted by the attack.

Breaking:The U.S. has attacked Venezuela and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro. Read our full coverage.

All actions have consequences—even arbitrary and inscrutable ones.

Updated at 12:00 p.m. ET on January 3, 2026

The Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro's regime lasted 12 years before America ended it today. This seems to be what the monthslong American military pressure campaign on Venezuela was building toward—the strikes on boats carrying drugs in international waters, the seizure of oil tankers, and the CIA-engineered port explosion. Early this morning, military installations in Caracas started exploding. Hours later, President Donald Trump announced that he had ordered a “large scale strike against Venezuela”—and that America had captured Maduro and flown him out of the country.

The apparent goal is to have Maduro stand trial in America, facing, in the words of Attorney General Pam Bondi, “the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.” In 2020, Maduro was indicted on charges of cocaine and weapons trafficking by federal prosecutors. Having gone here, the Trump administration apparently wishes to go no further: Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, told Republican Senator Mike Lee that he “anticipates no further action in Venezuela.”

This is Trump's most audacious foreign-policy decision in either term of office—more significant than the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander, in 2020 or even the strike on Iranian nuclear facilities last year. But, alongside the rest of Trump's decisions, it is an incoherent one: The “America First” faction of the Republican Party denigrates regime change as a compulsion of neoconservatives—then pulls off a defenestration as spectacular as America's arrest of Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian dictator, in 1990. Maduro is an authoritarian and a blight to the Venezuelan people, certainly, but this administration is hardly one that finds all autocrats anathema. Trump wants to bring Maduro to justice for allegedly running a narcotrafficking empire while president of Venezuela not even two months after pardoning Juan Orlando Hernández—who ran a narcotrafficking empire while president of Honduras and had been sentenced to 45 years in prison by an American jury. Trump wants to muscularly intervene in Central and South American affairs—what some observers are calling the “Donroe Doctrine”—but also does not want to deal with the increased migration that often comes from rupturing regimes.

How do we make sense of this new American arbitrariness—willing to drop massive bombs on buried Iranian nuclear facilities and kidnap dictators, but unwilling to keep providing funds to the defense of Ukraine, even if this risks no actual American soldiers? One interpretation of “America First” foreign policy is as a halfway station between proper isolationism and neoconservatism: The Trump administration intervenes where it can do so easily and without immediate consequence, but shies away from long-term commitments and occupations. This interpretation was undercut by Trump's statement at his 11 a.m. address, however, that the U.S. is “going to run the country.”

A second interpretation of the Venezuelan operation is that Trump is inaugurating a return to spheres of influence. Trump rejects the rules-based international order set up after World War II (which placed America as its keystone), and he despises the globalists in the Washington foreign-policy blob and European capitals who still believe in it. In this view, great powers ought to be able to intervene in their own backyards. This is why America can do as it sees fit in Venezuela. It is also why Trump often seems more sympathetic to Russian President Vladimir Putin than to Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky. The return of spheres-of-influence thinking bodes poorly for the chances of America intervening if China were to invade Taiwan while Trump is still in office. The conflict would be seen as an intramural dispute—one that poses risks to American ships, soldiers, and submarines that are orders of magnitude greater than the risks posed by Trump's targets so far.

The Venezuelan incursion also reflects the central failing of American domestic politics: the continued declining relevance of Congress. Even though the prescribed constitutional order is to have Congress declare wars, President Trump has brazenly ignored this power. In this instance, it is hard to even begin to construct the legal basis for the military action. Vice President J. D. Vance suggested on X that this morning's incursion is legal because “Maduro has multiple indictments in the United States for narcoterrorism.” But as my colleague Conor Friedersdorf has noted, this logic would mean that the president can order an invasion of “any country where a national has an outstanding arrest warrant.”

Of course, circumventing the legislature is not a Trumpian innovation. Harry Truman described the Korean War as an American “international police action” to avoid needing a formal congressional declaration of war. George H. W. Bush's invasion of Panama in 1989, which culminated in the arrest of Noriega, was also not authorized by Congress. What is new about the Trump era is taking the blithe disregard for the other branches of government that American presidents have enjoyed in foreign affairs and seeking to apply it to spheres of governance, too—whether that is the declaration of tariffs, the deployment of the National Guard, or even the enforcement of ordinary laws. The administration has essentially ignored the law requiring the sale of TikTok. It is hard to imagine the current Congress, having allowed the president to encroach on all of these powers already, demanding actual justification for the administration's actions in Venezuela.

But as free as Congress leaves him, Trump may find that the rest of the world does not comply with his wish to intervene militarily and “run” a foreign country, whatever that may mean. Perhaps a democratic revolution in Venezuela will place an opposition leader like María Corina Machado in charge; or perhaps another authoritarian figure will try to inherit Maduro's regime—just as  Maduro was able to reconstitute the regime of Hugo Chávez. Colombia has already had millions of Venezuelans flee across its borders and is worried about further destabilization. The principles of Trump's foreign policy remain even harder to discern after the Venezuelan intervention than they did before it. But all actions have consequences—even arbitrary and inscrutable ones.

﻿The US just attacked Venezuela. How did we get here?

President Donald Trump called for the US to “run” Venezuela on Saturday, shortly after the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro amid US strikes on the country's capital of Caracas. The attack is a major escalation in Trump's months-long pressure campaign against Venezuela and pushes the US into uncertain territory legally, politically, and militarily. Here's what we know.

US forces launched attacks against an unspecified number of targets in Caracas, Venezuela, overnight, and successfully located and captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The couple has since been flown out of the country, Trump said in an early morning social media post, and will be taken by ship to face criminal charges in the US. Much is still unclear, but Trump claims US troops are thought to have been killed in the attack.

Maduro has been under indictment in the US since March 2020, when the Southern District of New York charged him with narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, and corruption, along with 14 others. On Saturday, the Justice Department unsealed a new superseding indictment that brought additional charges against Maduro and also charged Flores and other members of Maduro's family, and FBI agents reportedly worked with US special forces to detain Maduro; the chair of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Dan Caine, described it on Saturday as an “unprecedented operation” conducted “in unison with our intelligence agency partners and law enforcement teammates.”

Under Trump, the US has also described Maduro as the head of a cartel called Cartel de los Soles, which it designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in November. As my colleague Josh Keating has explained, though, that designation stretches the definitions of both “terrorist” and “organization”: “Cartel de los Soles” is a term used in Venezuela to refer generally to criminality by government and military officials in Venezuela, but not any one unified organization.

This is the culmination, for now, of a US military effort that began with US strikes on alleged drug boats this September. The strikes, which are believed to have killed at least 115 people, targeted alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific, including those affiliated with the Venezuelan cartel Tren de Aragua.

At the same time as those strikes were ongoing, the US staged a substantial military buildup in the Caribbean — far more than would be needed for relatively limited anti-drug operations, including dispatching the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier group, B-52 bombers, and special operations helicopters generally used for ground operations. Trump also authorized the CIA to take covert action within Venezuela, and the US further stepped up its anti-regime efforts in December with the seizure of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.

However, Trump's relationship to Venezuela substantially predates tensions this summer: Early in 2025, he attempted to invoke the Alien Enemies Act against Tren de Aragua, threatened tariffs on countries buying oil or gas from Venezuela, and canceled (and then renewed) an oil export license allowing Chevron to operate in Venezuela.

More significantly, Trump has threatened military action in Venezuela long before this year. Early in his first term, in response to a 2017 crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Venezuela, he warned that “We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary.” Around that time, he also reportedly asked advisers about options for invading the country.

That experience set the tone for the rest of his first-term policy toward Venezuela, including a US-led effort to recognize Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate president and force out Maduro, which ultimately collapsed. Now, more than eight years after his first threat of military force, Trump has pulled the metaphorical trigger.

It's too early to say for sure, but it's starting to sound like one.

For now, while Maduro himself has been removed, his vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, is still in place, as is the rest of the Maduro government. Trump, however, repeatedly said in a Saturday press conference that the US intends to “run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” — presumably to a more US-friendly government.

In the same address, Trump also indicated US oil interests in Venezuela were a consideration, and warned that more US action could be forthcoming: “We're going to run [the country], essentially, until such time as a proper transition can take place. As everyone knows, the oil business in Venezuela has been a bust,” he said. “We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country. And we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.”

Venezuelan opposition leader and recent Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado also sounded a similar note on Saturday, releasing a statement titled “The hour of freedom has arrived.”

If so, however, what such an operation would look like is extremely unclear. The US history of regime change efforts, both in Latin America and more recently in the Middle East, is fraught, to say the least. And despite Machado's anti-Maduro activism, there's no clear government-in-waiting that the Trump administration could help into power: Trump told reporters Saturday that “I think it would be very tough for [Machado] to be the leader. She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country.”

Lastly, it's still possible the Trump administration simply won't follow through: As of Saturday, there was no evidence of a sustained US presence in Venezuela itself, though the US military buildup in the Caribbean is still in place.

Russia and Iran broadly condemned the U.S. attack on Venezuela early Saturday, while elsewhere, world leaders called for an immediate meeting of the UN Security Council.

UN ⁠Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he is ‍deeply ‍alarmed ‍by U.S. action in ‌Venezuela that ‌sets ""a dangerous ​precedent,"" his spokesperson said in a statement.

""The Secretary-General continues to emphasize the importance of full respect — by all — of international law, including the UN ‍Charter. He's deeply concerned ‌that ⁠the rules of international law have ‍not been respected,"" UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.

The Russian foreign ministry called Saturday's strikes on Venezuela ""an act of armed aggression"" that is ""deeply concerning and condemnable.""

""The pretexts used to justify such actions are unfounded ...In the current situation, it is important, first and foremost, to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue.""

""Latin America must remain a zone of peace, as it declared itself to be in 2014. And Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, interference from outside.""

The ministry said it was joining Venezuelan authorities and leaders of Latin American countries in calling for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council.

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva condemned the U.S. military attack on its neighbor, Venezuela, and said the capture of his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro, crossed ""an unacceptable line.""

""These acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela's sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community,"" Lula said in a post on X.

Lula also called for a ""vigorous"" response from the United Nations, adding that Brazil remains open to promoting dialogue and cooperation.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said the U.S. is ""arrogantly trying to impose something on the country, on the officials, on the government, and on the nation"" of Venezuela.

""We will not yield to the enemy,"" he said.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro, in a social media post on X, called for a meeting of the UN Security Council, saying the U.S. attack is an ""aggression against the sovereignty of Venezuela and Latin America."" 

Petro said Colombia also said it is deploying forces to the border ""in case of a massive influx of refugees.""

Kaja Kallas, EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said in a post on X that the European Union is closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela.

""I have spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and our Ambassador in Caracas... The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition,"" she said. 

""Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint. The safety of EU citizens in the country is our top priority,"" Kallas added.

The United States' military operation runs counter to the principles of international law, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said.

""The military operation that led to the capture of Nicolas Maduro violates the principle of not resorting to force, that underpins international law. France reiterates that no lasting political solution can be imposed from the outside and that only sovereign people themselves can decide their future,"" wrote Barrot on X.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said international law must be respected.

""Dramatic development in Venezuela, which we are following closely. We need to get back on track toward de-escalation and dialogue,"" Rasmussen wrote on X.

In Germany, Roderich Kiesewetter, a prominent member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, called the U.S. attack a ""coup.""

""With President [Donald] Trump, the U.S. are abandoning the rules-based order that has shaped us since 1945,"" he said. ""The coup in Venezuela marks a return to the old U.S. doctrine from before 1940: a mindset of thinking in terms of spheres of influence, where the law of force rules, not international law.""

Kiesewetter added: ""Trump is destroying what was left of any trust in the U.S.""

Maxime Prevot, Belgium's deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, said the safety of its citizens in Venezuels is the European country's top priority.

""Our embassy in Bogotá, which is responsible for Venezuela, and our services in Brussels are fully mobilized. The situation is being closely monitored, in coordination with our European partners.""

The Spanish foreign ministry urged the U.S. to de-escalate hostilities. 

""In this regard, Spain is willing to offer its good offices to achieve a peaceful and negotiated solution to the current crisis,"" it said in a statement.

Giuseppe Conte, a former prime minister and current opposition party leader in Italy, said the U.S. operation ""has no legal basis."" 

""We are facing a blatant violation of international law, which certifies the dominance of the strongest and best equipped militarily... I hope that the entire international community will make its voice heard and that everyone will understand that if rules only apply to enemies and not to friends, no one can feel safe anymore. Nor can the illiberal nature of a government's rule justify an attack to a sovereign state.""

Yvonne Mewengkang, spokesperson for Indonesia's foreign ministry, said it is monitoring developments to ensure the safety of its citizens in Venezuela.

""Indonesia also calls on all relevant parties to prioritize peaceful resolution through de-escalation and dialogue, while prioritizing the protection of civilians.""

""Indonesia emphasizes the importance of respecting international law and the principles of the UN Charter.""

In Trinidad and Tobago, Prime Minister Kamala Persad-Bissessar made clear that the country is not participating in U.S. military operations in Venezuela. 

""Trinidad and Tobago continues to maintain peaceful relations with the people of Venezuela,"" Persad-Bissessar said.

President Donald Trump on Saturday said U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars in Venezuela's energy sector after the overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro. 

""We're going to have our very large United States oil companies — the biggest anywhere in the world — go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure,"" Trump said in a press conference from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.

""Let's start making money for the country,"" Trump said.

U.S. forces captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in a large-scale attack on the South American nation overnight. They have been indicted on drug-trafficking charges in the Southern District of New York.

Trump said the U.S. will ""run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition."" The president said the U.S. will temporarily run Venezuela ""with a group,"" without providing details.

The overthrow of Maduro comes after a months-long U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean. Trump said the embargo he imposed on Venezuelan oil ""remains in full effect."" 

The president said oil companies will pay directly for the cost of rebuilding Venezuela's crude infrastructure. ""They will be reimbursed for what they're doing,"" Trump said.

""We're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,"" he said. ""We'll be selling large amounts of oil to other countries, many of whom are using it now, but I would say many more will come,"" he said. 

Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, sits on the largest oil reserves in the world. It nationalized the industry in 1976, seizing assets from Exxon Mobil, Shell and Chevron, said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. 

Venezuela's production peaked at 3.5 million barrels per day in the late 1990s, but has declined significantly since then, said Matt Smith, oil analyst at Kpler. The country's current production stands at around 800,000 barrels per day, according to Kpler data. For the week of Dec. 26, the U.S. produced around 13.8 million barrels per day.

China and Russia have a presence in Venezuela's oil sector, Lipow said. The Maduro regime in November approved a 15-year extension of joint ventures with Russian-linked companies operating fields in Venezuela, the analyst said.

The positive effect of exercise on the immune system is widely acknowledged, but the molecular response of immune cells to exercise remains largely unknown. Here, we perform mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at a depth of >6000 proteins. Comparing high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) and moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE), matched for time and workload, we identify versatile changes in the proteomic makeup of PBMCs and reveal profound alterations, related to effector function and immune cell activation pathways within one hour following exercise. These changes are more pronounced after HIIE compared to MICE and occur despite identical immune cell mobilization patterns between the two exercise conditions. We further identify an immunoproteomic signature that effectively predicts cardiorespiratory fitness, thus allowing insights into potential exercise-triggered adaptations and immunological health benefits that are mediated by exercise. This study provides a reliable data resource that expands our knowledge on how exercise modulates the immune system, and delivers biological evidence supporting the WHO 2020 guidelines, which highlight exercise intensity as a relevant factor to maintain health.

The days are counting down to Wonder Man, Marvel's latest TV series. Unlike most MCU shows, this one takes place on the West Coast in Hollywood, something the marketing's determined to never let you forget—and if anything, it seems Marvel wants you to keep that in mind for not just this show, but future projects.

After a new trailer dropped on New Year's, the show's social media accounts have been hitting hard the idea that Hollywood's taking a stand against enhanced individuals. “All super powers are now banned in Hollywood,” reads one ad, which says actors auditioning for the in-universe “Wonder Man” film will have to sign a “Doorman waiver” to confirm they're unpowered. The waiver was born of the similarly named “Doorman clause,” whose details we'll likely find out at some point during the show's run and the events of which seemingly led to the aforementioned ban.

Super powers are no longer allowed on Hollywood sets.

On one hand, these ads do a good job of further fleshing out the MCU and through an interesting lens: since we know how the average Joe feels about the Avengers or Daredevil, what would the upper class feel about them, particularly entertainers? Is a major star like George Clooney glad that Iron Man's dead? Are there big directors that would kill for the chance to make a film with a New Avenger or She-Hulk? The Hollywood framing also nods to Simon's (Yahya Abdul-Matteen II) comic book history as an actor and stuntman and gives him a good conflict: if anyone finds out he's got powers, he'll get blacklisted from the industry.

And that leads to the second thing this marketing is doing. In the comics, Doorman is DeMaar Davis, a man with teleportation and intangibility powers who first debuted in 1989's West Coast Avengers #46. Doorman will be portrayed in the Wonder Man show by Byron Bowers, and the character was created by John Byrne, who famously worked on the X-Men and co-created several of its biggest characters and storylines. Wonder Man himself is also linked to the X-Men via Beast, since the two are famously friends after they were both in the Avengers together.

We know the mutants are coming, and that Wonder Man is bringing in Damage Control to give Simon another threat to deal with. Does this mean whatever he does or chaos he causes spurs Damage Control or other interested parties to hate superpowered people enough to create Sentinels or other anti-mutant threats? We'll see after Wonder Man premieres January 27 on Disney+.

Brighton CEO Paul Barber has sent out a strong message to Manchester United over the future of Carlos Baleba, as he insists the midfielder is ""not for sale"" in either the January transfer window or the summer. Ruben Amorim's side are reported to be interested in signing the midfielder this month, but the Seagulls are not minded to allow him to leave.

United, per Sky Sports, are trying to sign Baleba in the January transfer window. The club are said to have sounded the midfielder out over a move, having also attempted to sign him in the summer. Fabrizio Romano claimed in December that United have ""not stopped discussing"" the idea of signing the midfielder, who had an asking price in excess of £100 million ($135m), ahead of the window. In January, though, United are said to understand that a deal is incredibly difficult and is not expected to progress before the summer window.

Now, Barber has claimed that he and the Brighton hierarchy have no desire to let Baleba leave, either in the January window or in the summer, even if he does accept that he will likely have interested parties given his talent.

Speaking to talkSPORT, he said: ""No call from Old Trafford. No call from anyone connected to Manchester United. We have no plans or desire to sell Carlos in this window, or in any future window, but we know he's a talented player and he's got a lot of options ahead of him in the future. For us right now, he's an important player in the second half of the season and we're looking forward to getting him back from AFCON.""

Speaking about the speculation over his move to United in the summer, he said: ""I don't think it affected me negatively, but I had a lot of pressure on me. When I started this season, I wanted to show the same performances as last season. Every day I try to work hard and get back to my level. Did I put too much pressure on myself? Yes, I think so, but I think it's good. It's good for me, because now I have to get through this slightly stressful period, get back on the horse, and continue working hard.""

Ruben Amorim, United's manager, has said that the club will only enter the market for the ""perfect"" player in January.

He said: “The only thing that we will try to bring now – and in the end of the season – are players that are perfect for our future,” Amorim said ahead of United's trip to Aston Villa on Sunday.

“It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON. It's not going to be like that. Even if we try to bring one player, maybe it's not the position that we need more. So I don't know what is going to happen, but it's possible that we can do something.

“I'm just focused on the next game. Let's go step by step. We have a big match. We need to win. We need to try to find different ways of playing, especially without Amad and Bryan. We lost some characteristics that are hard to find.”

United are likely to continue scouting Baleba throughout the remainder of the season. 

In the summer, owner Tony Bloom confirmed United's interest, but said they did not ever come close to matching their valuation. 

He said: “There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away. So we've had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.”","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

[This story contains spoilers from Jurassic World: Chaos Theory series finale.]


	Unlike other animated, kid-friendly franchise spinoffs, Jurassic World: Chaos Theory isn't a cute-but-unessential extension of its live-action blockbuster counterparts. The series, a follow-up to 2020's Camp Cretaceous, exists in the same universe as the Steven Spielberg, Colin Trevorrow and Frank Marshall-produced trilogy, taking viewers to some of the same places even at the same time as the big screen adventures. 




	Both were true for Chaos Theory's final season, which dropped its leading group of teens directly into the timeline of Dominion. Their return to the small screen — which concluded on Nov. 20 with the release of season four on Netflix — allowed the series and its six young adult leads to go to corners of the Biosyn Valley audiences won't see in the third installment of Trevorrow's live-action films.

	“Then you have that whole velociraptor training,” says art director JP Balmet. “We really looked at the movie, at those hallways and how you get down to the locust area, and asked what other stuff could be in this place that we hadn't seen. What doors weren't open?” 


	It's not just the settings that expanded the Jurassic World sequel trilogy either. A plot twist tied to a character's faked death and reemergence with a limb difference produced something that wasn't possible even in the Chris Pratt-led films. “Colin told us after he saw it, ‘Wow, you did something that none of the features could do. You had one of our heroes sustain a serious injury,'” recalls Executive Producer Scott Kreamer. 

	











	For the fourth and final season, members of the Chaos Theory team spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how they paid tribute to — and kept on expanding — their big screen universe. 


	When Kreamer was first developing his pitch for Chaos Theory, he knew two things: First, Brooklynn was never actually dead. Second, he expected her Camp Cretaceous voice actor, Jenna Ortega, to return. What he didn't know was how they'd bring Brooklynn back — or that Ortega was no longer available. “Silly me,” recalls the co-showrunner and EP. “I talked to head of casting Ania [O'Hare], and went, ‘Well, maybe.' She goes, ‘You turn on the TV and tell me how many times you see her.'”


	Ortega's shot to global stardom thanks to a different Netflix series (Wednesday) led the team to recast Brooklynn's voice actor, paving the way for the hiring of Kiersten Kelly, a newcomer with congenital trans-radial absence. “If at all possible, we wanted to hire someone with a limb difference, but not at the expense of performance,” says Kreamer. “So we had castings with many people, some with limb differences, some without. There was a groundedness and an authenticity in Kiersten's performance.”


	In addition to voice work, Kelly would assist the show's art and animation teams, providing video references and offering thoughts on Brooklynn's animatics that Kreamer put in front of her, “any chance we got,” he says. The writing and animation departments also turned to scribe Peter Lee, whose hiring was the result of a series of panels organized by Disability Belongs, featuring a small group of consultants with congenital or acquired limb differences. Over several conversations, they answered “questions about daily life with a limb difference and, more specifically, the physical and emotional process of recovering from traumatic limb loss,” says Lee. It would lead to tweaks in things like Brooklynn's injury scar, the addition of a zipper on her shoes, and the fit of her prosthetic.

	











	The show also made adjustments to the kind of limb loss Brooklyn experienced, initially imagined as above the elbow for animation reasons. But to have a whole arm replacement and its respective prosthesis, Brooklynn needed to wear a weighty harness, restricting quick movement and certain kinds of action. “We had this idea that she gets this bionic arm,” Balmet recalls. “Someone spoke up and said this was something they didn't like. [Limb loss is] something you have to adapt to, and becomes a major part of your life. You give them this bionic arm, and it's like an easy solve.” 


	A consultant showed the team their below-the-elbow prosthetic, highlighting increased mobility. “She can be an action star with that kind of limb difference,” the art director recalls being told. “Another thing that came from those meetings was that a lot of this prosthetic stuff is for other people. People with limb differences while in the house don't need or use it. We had to get people comfortable with the idea of Brooklynn without her prosthetic. Some weren't used to it, weren't sure what to do with the exposed limb. But we ended up leaning into it because we realized that was our problem, that wasn't the problem of someone with a limb difference.”


	“In TV or film, you never really get an inkling of how people's prosthetics, chairs or whatever their device is become a part of who they are, and you don't understand that those things are a tool that they use to get through the day,” Lee says. “So to see her without her prosthetic, and struggling to understand what it means to wear or not wear it — to accept it — those were super important things to show.”

	











	Lee would be part of all those panel discussions, and while the Chaos Theory team didn't initially know he was a writer, Disability Belongs facilitated the submission of a spec script, with his panel contributions serving as his unintentional pitch for Brooklynn's arc. He was hired through the show's freelance budget, and wrote three episodes total, with Story Editor Bethany Armstrong Johnson noting “if we had had a bigger budget, we would have loved to have had him on full-time.”


	“We very easily included him in meetings, story breaks — just the whole creative process from the writing side, but also from the art side,” the head writer recalls. “It is weird because there can be a perceived difficulty or cost [of bringing on a disabled writer], but there's a cost in anything anybody does. People will make these adjustments in their time or space for other things. This felt like a necessity, so we were going to figure out how to do it.”


	Initially assigned season two's flashback heavy “C13v3rGr186,” Lee sped through the two animated series to “dictate how Brooklyn would organically respond” to the dinosaur attack — a plot development that came from Supervising Producer Zesung Kang. “Not only did it make sense within the story, not only did it raise the stakes, but then we had an opportunity to showcase a character from a community that's about 25% of the actual population,” Kreamer tells THR. 


	“Her acquired limb difference informs her character, but it doesn't define her character,” he continues. “Her journey sees a lot of questionable decision-making, which we wanted to have set in motion before the limb difference, so it wasn't like, ‘Now she's evil because she's got a limb difference,' or ‘Now she's superpowered.' We didn't want to ‘how brave to overcome' her.”

	











	Kreamer also points to an initial uncomfortable interaction between Brooklyn and fellow “Nublar Six” member Ben (Sean Giambrone) after he discovers both she's alive and experienced Brooklyn's limb loss as another way they team wanted “to tell that truth” through Brooklyn's story. 


	“I shared my personal experiences with those things, and that informed part of how we handled that in the show. After I lost my arm, strangers just thought that's who I was, as opposed to me having to explain myself [to people I knew before], and having to navigate their emotional journey on top of whatever else I was doing,” Lee says. “The kind of loss that she experiences, the relationship dynamics that she has to navigate, her coming to a new understanding of who she is, and meandering off the right path for a while, all those things were things that I talked about from my own personal experiences. But they are universal experiences, too. We all go through losses and changes.”


	Added Lee; “We never tried to take the easy way out; to say, ‘Let's not deal with that because this is an animated show, and, ostensibly, for kids. She found her way to this place of maturation and becoming who she is. It's a coming of age story and I love that for her.” 


	Across four seasons, Brooklyn was part of how the Chaos Theory team pushed the boundaries of storytelling within the Jurassic World universe. But they also delivered their own spin on the sense of awe, wonder — and horror — of the franchise's biggest stars: the dinosaurs. To do that, Balmet and Lighting & Compositing Supervisor Eric Hawkins turned to cinematographers from the original Jurassic Park films, their libraries, and Dominion as references, with John Carpenter, as well as Terrence Malick's Badlands and The Tree of Life, inspiring the animated series visuals. 

	











	“When Ben sees [ankylosaurus] Bumpy for the first time, and it's that pretty sunset, that's the stuff that we were looking at to try to get an emotional response. A big sunset makes you feel like the world is worth living in,” Balmet explains. “In the hallways of the underground lab in Senegal, when the blind Baryonyx was running around, it was a little bit more Silent Hill or Jacob's Ladder. This place is where bad things happen. We wanted you to really feel like they were in danger, so we put in that lighting, that texture.”


	In the final season of the DreamWorks Animation Television installment, the team continued that approach to animating the theratinosaurus and the quetzalcoatlus — “the two biggest rigs and designs we've ever had,” says Kreamer. The show received materials from Industry Light & Magic, who worked on the live-action films, and among multiple departments, made slight adaptations to Dominion's existing dinosaur designs for their animated medium, while trying to remain “accurate to what they had already put on screen,” says Balmet.


	“[Visual Development Artist] Chris Sears, in particular, was really smart about the way that he sculpted the body [of the quetzalcoatlus], so it feels furrier than it is. We didn't have to put as much simulated fur, and we could focus on its cool Mohawk,” he explains of the furry, winged dinosaur that was the size of a car. 


	The therizinosaurus would deliver one of the season's most memorable scares, in a sequence that sees the creature tracking the Camp Crew to a Biosyn Valley veterinary clinic as they attempt to escape a raging fire. Kreamer credits Hawkins, Armstrong Johnson, Kang, the show's directors, artists, and composer Leo Birenberg's score for helping “put the audience in the same headspace as these kids who are fighting for their lives,” he tells THR. 

	











	“The therizinosaurus claw that swipes across the window was a conscious choice,” adds Balmet, while pointing to Hawkins' work. “We wanted to have this flickering firelight in the background that's there, so you feel like it's closing in. And we were thinking, if you can see outside, why wouldn't you see the shadow of it lurking nearby? Then someone had the idea of putting the claw in. That was something that we hadn't seen in the movie.”


	Yet season four's most captivating moment arguably came from what CG Animation Director Ryan Donoghue calls the grand farewell to Chaos Theory's dinosaur ensemble — a battle staged outside that clinic featuring three tyrannosaurus rexes and five junior velociraptors. ‘


	He and the show's overseas animation studio CGCG were particular about depicting the dinosaurs, particularly their weight, throughout the clash, because “if they move too fast or they don't have the right step, then the action doesn't hold up” in terms of believability, he tells THR. “When the main Rexy is down, and then the two juvenile Rexes run up, they're kind of emotional. You see them bounding up and kind of into each other. They're not predatory and in control. In that moment, they're a wild, almost herd — an unstoppable force.”


	In the sequence, both groups of dinos essentially form up into lines, but Donoghue notes that it “was a tricky moment because… at first it looked like West Side Story.” To avoid the dinosaurs “acting” like a football team's offensive line and thus anthropomorphizing them (versus portraying them as instinctual, “unpredictable” creatures), the CG animation director changed the raptors' positions so they naturally stopped in the middle of something. 

	











	“The way we slow [the T. rexes] in is that they start to assess the situation. The story isn't about them running up, going ‘We're going to fight.' They're like, ‘What are you doing here? What are you doing to our friend?'” Donoghue says. “Because the raptors are taken by surprise, they just kind of wait, confused for a second, and that's what gives time for our main Rexy to stand up slowly and ominously, get back on her feet, and start to dominate the scene. And that's when all hell breaks loose.”


	It's a sequence made even more dynamic thanks to Hawkins. “When you have that rain-lit night with the fire, and you get the bounce light off of the dinosaurs with the warm light that's coming in from an outside source, it's so scary and so dramatic,” Donoghue says. “When you think about CG series, TV can be hard to get real atmosphere, where you feel like you're in a place, and Eric, with how he adds that emotional depth to the shots, through how he lights, it gives us all this atmosphere. It's the secret sauce that really helps tie everything together.”

Yungblud has kicked off 2026 with a high-profile collaboration, unveiling a new version of his song “Zombie” featuring The Smashing Pumpkins.


	The reimagined track marks the first time the Pumpkins have appeared on another artist's recording, a notable moment in the band's three-decade career.


	Originally released as part of Yungblud's fourth studio album Idols, “Zombie” has become the British rocker's fastest-streaming solo single to date, surpassing 100 million global streams. The song is nominated for best rock song at the 2026 Grammy Awards, while Idols is also nominated for best rock album.

	The updated version retains the emotional core of the original recording while leaning into a darker, heavier sound. Yungblud opens the track with the familiar first verse and chorus before Billy Corgan enters on the second verse,.


	The new arrangement features denser guitar layers and a more foreboding atmosphere, amplifying the song's themes of trauma, grief and emotional isolation.


	In a recent interview with interview with Loudwire, Yungblud revealed that Siamese Dream was a key reference point while writing “Zombie.” “When I was making ‘Zombie,' I was really channeling Siamese Dream,” he said. 


	“It was really the sadness and the melancholic emotion mixed with the aggression of Billy's guitars.”


	He added that the original demo for “Zombie” was initially heavier, but he scaled it back out of concern that it leaned too closely toward the Pumpkins' sound. 

	











	“I always imagined another take,” Yungblud said, describing the new version as a way to finally “scratch that itch.”


	That idea became reality after Yungblud reached out directly to Corgan. 


	Within days, the singer flew to Chicago — the Pumpkins' hometown — to record the new version and its accompanying music video. The visual, directed by Charlie Sarsfield, features both artists and was released alongside the track.


	The collaboration follows a landmark year for Yungblud. 


	In addition to his Grammy nominations, Idols topped the U.K. Albums Chart and reached No. 15 on Billboard's Top Rock & Alternative Albums chart. He also earned a Top 10 debut on the Billboard 200 with One More Time, his collaborative EP with Aerosmith. 


	The EP's single “My Only Angel” debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Hard Rock Songs chart.


	Looking ahead, Yungblud is set to head to Australia for a string of shows as part of his Idols tour, as well as a sold-out U.K. arena tour beginning April 11, with additional international dates expected later in the year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Daisy Ridley finds something to live for in the contemplative zombie movie We Bury The Dead","https://www.avclub.com/we-bury-the-dead-review","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 00:28:00 GMT","

Label a film a “zombie movie” and our genre-trained brains zip right to the question of whether it will feature fast-moving or slow-moving iterations of the undead. With that trope so embedded into the modern DNA of this particular horror subgenre, it's refreshing when a filmmaker puts it on the backburner and explores something more interior, which is what writer-director Zak Hilditch (1922) does with We Bury The Dead.

The Australian filmmaker uses the sparseness of his home country as a haunting backdrop for this intimate examination of a woman on a journey to understand her humanity. Ava Newman (Daisy Ridley) is an American, compelled to travel to Tasmania in the wake of an accidental American detonation of “something” off the coast of the remote island. More than 300,000 are now dead, and that may include Ava's husband Mitch (Matt Whelan), who was attending a corporate retreat on the island and hasn't touched base since all communications went dead. 

Adrift in a fugue state, Ava arrives on the island to volunteer, assigned to one of many body retrieval teams organized by the Australian military. Their mission is to go into all of the rural communities that are furthest away from the impact zone to remove bodies from residences so they can be buried. Ava's seemingly selfless call to action actually masks her true intention to eventually branch out on her own to find out if her husband is alive or dead. Only after she lands does she find out that there could be a third option: A by-product of this modern catastrophe is that some victims are waking up, then quickly culled by the military.

Hilditch does a fine job laying out the necessary specifics of the event, the repercussions, and the unexpected undead twist which begins more as a mystery than an overt threat. More importantly, all of the setup is used in service of Ava's physical and mental journey into this foreign reality. As she engages in the bleak, voyeuristic work of intruding into these abandoned homes to recover the dead, Ava is forced to knock on her own doors, confronting and acknowledging the unresolved complexities of her marriage. It's through a series of flashbacks framed as Ava's remembrances that the audience gets a more truthful taste of who she and Mitch were together before. A once blissful marriage is increasingly laid bare as desperately complicated and damaged by years of infertility issues, blame, and guilt.

Initially, Ridley conveys much of Ava's numbness and interior conflict through her amply expressive face, with little dialogue and to great success. The opening third of We Bury The Dead provides her a rich succession of scenes that are allowed to breathe as she finds her moorings in this disturbing wasteland of lost futures and abrupt endings. Ridley's work is supported by rich sound design which provides space for Ava's solitude while also gently building an aural tapestry for this island—which includes the spine-chilling noises associated with the “waking,” including their signature teeth-grinding. It's sparse in execution but intensely effective in conjuring immediate tension whenever they appear. 

Hilditch and his editor Merlin Eden set an unhurried pace for Ava's journey that might seem antithetical to modern horror, but it facilitates the way this place changes her—slowly, but thoroughly, so she'll be ready to face the answers awaiting her. The inclusion of two challenging male characters also allows us to see how Ava holds herself when placed under the eyes of others. With fellow body retriever Clay (Brenton Thwaites), she develops an unconventional bond as he is bracingly candid and seemingly apathetic about the death around them. His lack of social niceties allows Ava to shed the less attractive parts of her own nature. And with Riley (Mark Coles Smith), a soldier who is also mourning the loss of a spouse, comes a disturbing encounter that grounds the story in the realities of a woman traversing any landscape alone. It's the most terrifying horror sequence of the film. 

As for those awoken by this disaster, Hilditch takes the existential path. That means there are plenty of unanswered questions, but questions which bolster Ava's quest to determine what she wants out of life now that she may be alone. She's remarkably unafraid of those who now straddle the living and the dead and more intrigued by what she can still recognize in an ambling corpse, or a newly woken father that bestows one last act of love to his dead family. If these recently dead can still hold onto the best of themselves, what keeps the living from doing the same? For those looking to delve into more philosophical horror, We Bury The Dead is a thoughtful trek into the unknown. As Ava moves towards her own discovery, she ends up finding more truth in what remains unresolved—by experiencing what grief dredges up in the living.

	In the early hours of Saturday, President Donald Trump announced that American forces had carried out a “large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro,” capturing both him and his wife, Cilia Flores, in a not-so-covert operation that rained American munitions over Caracas, Venezuela's capital. 


	Trump's announcement was followed by a statement from Attorney General Pam Bondi that Maduro “will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,” on newly filed charges related to “Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy.”


	The United States has not deposed a foreign leader in such a direct manner in decades, and concerns were immediately raised about the legality of such a move against a sovereign nation.  Details of the operation and its justification remain hazy, and the action is sure to have a dramatic impact on the region and the world. Here's everything we know so far. 


	Nicolás Maduro has been the president of Venezuela since 2013, after serving as vice president under Hugo Chavez. His tenure atop the oil-rich nation has been characterized by economic collapse, rights abuses, and illegitimate elections. The United States indicted him in 2020, under Trump's first administration, on charges related to corruption and narco-terrorism. The second Trump administration slapped additional charges on Maduro on Saturday, after U.S. forces attacked Venezuela and captured him. 

	











	In 2025, Maduro began a third six-year term as president of the country despite credible evidence that he lost the 2024 election by a significant margin to opposition candidate Edmundo González, a stand-in candidate for Maria Corina Machado, a popular opposition leader who had been barred from running against Maduro. 

	











	Following weeks of escalating military operations and deadly U.S. airstrikes against small vessels in the Caribbean that the Trump administration claims were running drugs, the U.S., including a Delta Force unit, attacked the Venezuelan capital on Saturday.

	A spokesperson for the Venezuelan government confirmed to multiple media outlets that at least four strategic Venezuelan targets had been hit by U.S. airstrikes, including Fort Tiuna, Caracas' primary military base, and La Guardia port. 


	In an interview on Sunday with Fox News, Trump — who watched the strikes for his Mar-a-Lago residence, where he was spending the holidays — said the Venezuelan first couple were captured in a “highly guarded” compound. “It was like a fortress, actually,” he added. The president revealed that the operation was originally scheduled to take place on Christmas, but was delayed due to poor weather.  


	According to sources who spoke to CNN, Maduro and his wife were sleeping when captured, and dragged from their bedroom by elite U.S. forces. 


	The president told Fox News that the couple were transferred by helicopter to the U.S.S. Iwo Jima, which will transport them to New York, where the new charges against Maduro and his wife were filed.


	Trump told Fox News that there were “a few injuries but no deaths on our side.” 


	“I think we had nobody killed, I have to say, because a couple of guys were hit. But they came back and they're supposed to be in pretty good shape,” he added. “We lost no aircraft. Everything came back. One of them was hit pretty hard, a helicopter, but we got it back.”

	In a televised appearance, Venezuela's attorney general, Tarek William Saab, stated that “innocent victims have been mortally wounded and others killed by this criminal terrorist attack,” but he did not provide casualty figures. 


	In a press conference on Saturday, Trump said that the attack had been “deadly.”


	In 2020, under the first Trump administration, Maduro (along with over a dozen other Venezuelan officials associated with his government) was indicted on charges related to alleged involvement in “a corrupt and violent narco-terrorism  conspiracy between the Venezuelan Cartel de Los Soles and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (‘FARC').” 

	











	The charges against Maduro included narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices. On Saturday, Bondi made public a superseding indictment adding the Venezuelan first lady to the charges against her husband.


	The capture of Maduro raised immediate concerns about its legality under international law. The Trump administration isn't the only government to desire Maduro's removal from power, but direct intervention to force his ouster by U.S. military operatives appears to be a direct violation of Venezuelan sovereignty. 


	Members of Congress have indicated that they were not informed of the operation ahead of time, and that the Trump administration did not seek constitutionally required congressional authorization for its now-months-long military campaign against Venezuela. 


	“Secretaries [Marco] Rubio and [Pete] Hegseth looked every Senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn't about regime change. I didn't trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) wrote on social media. “This strike doesn't represent strength. It's not sound foreign policy. It puts Americans at risk in Venezuela and the region, and it sends a horrible and disturbing signal to other powerful leaders across the globe that targeting a head of state is an acceptable policy for the U.S. government.” 


	In a statement released Saturday, the United Nations wrote that “independently of the situation in Venezuela, these developments constitute a dangerous precedent. The Secretary-General continues to emphasize the importance of full respect — by all — of international law, including the UN Charter. He's deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected.” 


	The United States has not recognized Maduro's government since 2019, when the first Trump administration endorsed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela. 


	On that basis, the Trump administration is arguing that their capture of Maduro does not constitute a violation of Venezuelan sovereignty as it is not a recognized government. 


	In response to the news, Secretary of State Marco Rubio re-shared a July post in which he wrote that “Maduro is NOT the President of Venezuela and his regime is NOT the legitimate government.” 

	











	“Maduro is the head of the Cartel de los Soles, a narco-terror organization which has taken possession of the country, and he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States,” the post read.


	The U.S. government has for months been using allegations of narco-terrorism as a justification for its escalating military actions in the region — with particular focus on the Tren de Aragua cartel. However, a 2025 National Intelligence Council report found that “the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States,” adding that “the small size of TDA's cells, its focus on low-skill criminal activities, and its decentralized structure make it highly unlikely that TDA coordinates large volumes of human trafficking or migrant smuggling.”  


	Regardless of the on-the-ground reality, the Trump administration is poised to continue an interventionist policy throughout the Americas. According to the 2025 National Security Strategy, Trump's government intends to “reassert and enforce the Monroe Doctrine to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere,” adding “Trump Corollary” to the influence principle. 


	“They now call it the ‘Don-roe Doctrine,' Trump said Saturday, “American dominance in the Western hemisphere will never be questioned again.” 


	It's not clear. 


	When asked on Fox News, Trump refused to outright endorse Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year. “We're going to have to look at it,” the president said, adding that Venezuela has “a vice president, as you know, and I don't know about what kind of election that was.” 


	In a press conference late Saturday morning, Trump indicated that his administration intended to “run” Venezuela for the time being. “We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” he said, adding that he intended to “have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in.” 


	“We are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so,” he warned.

	Corina Machado, who was barred from seeking office by the Maduro regime, was not the official candidate in the 2024 Venezuelan election. Instead, she ran as the shadow candidate behind former diplomat Edmundo González, who is currently living in exile in Spain after being targeted by the Maduro regime. 

	











	The majority of Maduro's inner circle and heads of government remain in power in Venezuela, and it's unclear if the political opposition will be able to gather the institutional support necessary to force a full dissolution of Maduro's government, or what role the U.S. will play.

MOSCOW, January 3. /TASS/. The US military operation in Venezuela, which resulted in the capture of its leader Nicolas Maduro has generally caused condemnation from the international community.

In the statements of the leaders and foreign ministries of several countries, Washington's action is characterized as aggression and an attempt to change power in the country, which are fraught with unpredictable consequences for the whole world.

TASS has compiled the key international reactions to the incident.

The situation in Venezuela has shown that ""any state needs to strengthen its armed forces as much as possible, not allowing various rich scoundrels to easily change the constitutional system in search of oil or something else,"" Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, told reporters.

Medvedev referred to ""a tough military operation in an independent country that did not threaten the United States in any way"" and ""the capture of a legally elected president and his wife by special forces.""

The act of armed aggression by the United States against Venezuela causes deep concern and condemnation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement: ""The pretexts used to justify such actions are untenable. Ideologized hostility prevailed over business pragmatism, willingness to build relationships of trust and predictability.""

The ministry said it was ""extremely alarmed by the reports that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife were forcibly removed from the country during today's aggressive actions by the United States.""

""Such actions, if they actually took place, constitute an unacceptable encroachment on the sovereignty of an independent state, respect for which is a key principle of international law.""

The US strikes on Venezuela are ""direct military aggression with an attempted coup with external interference,"" said Leonid Slutsky, head of the State Duma's International Affairs Committee and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party.

Leader of Just Russia Sergey Mironov also condemned the US strikes on Venezuela and called them ""treacherous aggression.""

The leaders of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) said that the situation ""raises serious concern in the region and may have consequences for neighboring countries.""

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva criticized the US strikes, calling the events crossing a ""red line"" and ""an extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community.""

Chilean President Gabriel Boric said his country condemns the US strikes and called for a ""peaceful solution to the serious crisis engulfing the country.""

The Mexican government condemned the military actions taken by the United States, saying that this ""is a clear violation of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations.""

Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel demanded an urgent response from the international community in response to the ""criminal attack"" by the United States on Venezuela, calling it ""state terrorism against the brave Venezuelan people and against our America.""

The Belarusian Foreign Ministry condemned the aggression against Venezuela and spoke out in support of the legitimate government of the Latin American country.

Spokesperson of the President of Belarus Natalia Eismont said that the country's leader Alexander Lukashenko categorically condemns the act of American aggression against Venezuela.

Belarusian Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov supported the government of the Latin American country talking to his Venezuelan counterpart Ivan Gill Pinto over the phone.

The South Ossetian Foreign Ministry called the attacks on civilian and military facilities in Venezuela a gross violation of the UN Charter, calling on international organizations to take steps to prevent escalation and resolve the situation diplomatically as soon as possible.

The European Union calls for restraint in the situation around Venezuela and believes that Maduro ""did not have sufficient legitimacy,"" head of the European Diplomacy Kaja Kallas said on X after a conversation with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen joined the support for a ""peaceful transfer of power in Venezuela"" allegedly on the basis of international norms after Maduro's abduction.

Switzerland called on the US administration ""to de-escalate, exercise restraint and comply with international law, including the prohibition on the use of force and the principle of respect for territorial integrity.""

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called for de-escalation and responsible behavior.

Austrian Vice Chancellor Andreas Babler condemned the US attack on Venezuela, calling it ""a serious violation of the prohibition on the use of violence enshrined in the UN Charter."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","One's a Democrat and the other's a Republican","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/03/us/twin-brothers-democrat-republican-indiana","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 13:00:59 GMT","


            When Indiana state lawmakers were under pressure from President Donald Trump and his allies to redistrict and create more GOP-friendly seats in Congress, Nick Roberts, an Indianapolis city-county councilor, was among a legion of Democrats who testified against it at the state capitol.
    


            After his testimony last month, messages trickled in, and people were confused. Some thought they saw him advocating in favor of redistricting that day. Some thought his remarks must have been AI-generated.
    


            Regardless of the reasons, Roberts knew what the confusion was all about. He had to get ahead of the issue.
    


            “If you see somebody that looks like me at a Republican event, or definitely if they're wearing a MAGA hat, it is not me, it is him,” Roberts explained in a video he posted on social media, saying he has a twin brother who's also in politics, and who definitely isn't a Democrat.
    


            “While we disagree on a lot of things, he's still my brother and I care about him,” he said.
    


            His twin, Nathan Roberts, also testified that day, but in favor of redistricting, arguing voters had years to elect different leadership and refused to. Unlike his brother, Nathan forayed into the public policy space, creating the anti-mass migration nonprofit Save Heritage Indiana with Daniel Poynter, who founded Technology for Freedom, a tech firm that's worked with conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation.
    


            “There's nothing about illegal immigration at the state house. So, we created a nonprofit group based off of it because we thought there was a huge need,” Nathan told CNN.
    


            They've centered their organization on this belief of preserving Indiana's cultural heritage and ending mass migration to the state and have notched some top endorsements from state lawmakers, including Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, a Republican.
    


            Nick says he disagrees sharply with how his brother is tackling the immigration issue.
    


            “I disagree with basically every single issue that my brother works on politically, the redistricting stuff, the immigration stuff, the education stuff. We disagree on 95% of political issues,” he told CNN.
    


            They've been like that since they were kids, with Nick branding himself as “the Democrat” in a middle school essay. Trump's election got them more interested in politics, albeit with Nick jumping into the public sphere earlier, elected in 2023 as Indianapolis' youngest city-county councilor at age 23.
    


            Home life for the now-25-year-old twins in Indianapolis was a multigenerational melting pot of political perspectives from religious conservatives to progressive liberals.
    


            They were raised by a mother just out of high school, a smattering of relatives and a disabled veteran father who was in and out of their lives. Nick credits his father's hard work and his family's small businesses with shaping his political beliefs.
    


            After Nick's video came out, Nathan woke up to a slew of journalists following him on X. He brushed it aside, carrying on with his morning until a friend sent a text saying they loved what Nick had posted.
    


            “Oh God,” he thought before watching it, thinking it might be controversial. But after watching, he said, he thought it was fair.
    


            But the brothers aren't known for combative arguments that devolve into shouting matches. While some families may have a relative who no longer comes over due to estrangement over political disagreements, the twins have navigated their relationship despite their political disparities.
    


            “I don't think we've ever even had an argument on politics that even kind of reached the level of beginning to be a shouting match,” said Nathan.
    


            In a time of increased political polarization, cordiality might seem rare, but the Roberts aren't the only twins in politics on different sides of the aisle who still maintain a bond.
    


            In 2018, twin sisters Monica Sparks, a Democrat, and Jessica Ann Tyson, a Republican, ran for county commissioner in different districts in Michigan and have kept a warm relationship.
    


            Polarization has destroyed some family relationships, Sparks told CNN, but she emphasized Americans are all working and living together: “left wing, right wing, same bird.”
    


            Said Tyson, “My sister and I, we don't always see eye to eye, but we do make an investment in our relationship, because we're sisters and we're twins.”
    


            Craig DeLuz, a Republican in California running for a US House seat in 2026, and David DeLuz, a Democrat and deputy director of the Office of Civil Rights at California's transportation department, have championed their differences and talked about fostering healthy discourse online.
    


            Nick and Nathan credited their easygoing nature as key to their civility, and they've found some common ground on a few things, namely a love of dogs and running in the annual Wheeler Mission Drumstick Dash in Indianapolis.
    


            They were always stuck together in the same Advanced Placement classes and shared buddies in school. Their great-grandfather, Carl Brooks, who died in 2021, introduced them to maps, fostering a shared interest.
    


            “He would show us maps and everything, and we would sit on his lap looking through them. And now we both love maps still to this day, my brother and I do, even despite our disagreements,” said Nick.
    


            But it can still be difficult to find consensus in a country where affective polarization – how much people of differing political parties dislike each other – has continued to dramatically reshape how Americans have discourse, where they get their information and whom they speak with.
    


            Trump critics have looked at the president's rise to power as exacerbating differences and increasing friction among Americans. But these fissures started well before Trump's first victory in 2016, with historians citing the 1970s as the time when things started to become more polarized.
    


            The Republican and Democratic parties have become more ideologically cohesive since then, sharpening political divide.
    


            The rise of social media and 24/7 cable news, politics becoming core parts of identity, and economic inequality have all contributed to affective polarization, said Bill Doherty, cofounder of Braver Angels, a nonprofit focused on bipartisan political dialogue.
    


            For those with differing political opinions, family gatherings may be times of stress, as debates over hot-button issues like abortion, gun control and immigration can devolve into shouting matches.
    


            If a tough topic comes up as someone passes the mashed potatoes, there are ways to navigate these conversations.
    


            Establishing a warm relationship with the other person and setting expectations for the conversation can reduce conflict in discussing shared political opinions, said Dr. Tania Israel, a psychologist who wrote two books on polarization and mental health. The goal should be understanding the other side, not actively challenging their views.
    


            “You don't want to challenge them because they're not going to pay any attention to that when you don't have that warm and trusting relationship with them,” said Israel.
    


            Nick says he would agree.
    


            “If we want to change hearts and minds, you don't do it by 30 feet down and telling people how wrong they are. You have to do it through empathy,” he said.
    


            Where these conversations take place is also important; dinner table discussions can seem more like a grandstanding debate performance rather than an opportunity for understanding and togetherness, said Israel. One-on-one time, such as a walk or coffee chat, establishes privacy, which can make it easier to focus on how to strengthen the relationship.
    


            The Roberts twins already have that established relationship, and by listening and not letting things get too heated, they say they've been able to maintain a bond where fundamental political disagreements aren't a relationship-ender – even if their political activities have made it hard to take photos together.
    


            Also, a moratorium on politics during Thanksgiving helped.
    


            “With me and my brother, we talk about politics between us all the time, but at Thanksgiving, politics was not brought up one time,” said Nathan.

Key Takeaways:

India's central bank has issued a firm warning to policymakers: central bank digital currencies should take precedence over stablecoins as countries modernize their payment systems.

In its December Financial Stability Report, the Reserve Bank of India framed CBDCs as the only digital money capable of preserving the “singleness of money” – a principle it views as foundational to trust, settlement finality, and financial stability.

The message is unambiguous. While stablecoins may offer speed and programmability, the RBI believes they introduce new systemic risks that could surface sharply during periods of market turmoil.



According to the report, privately issued stablecoins can create parallel monetary systems that operate outside direct sovereign control. In stressed market conditions, these instruments could accelerate capital flight, liquidity mismatches, or confidence shocks – particularly in emerging economies.

The RBI cautioned that jurisdictions must carefully evaluate how stablecoins interact with their domestic financial systems before allowing them to scale. Unlike central bank money, stablecoins depend on issuer credibility, reserve management, and legal clarity – variables that may fracture under pressure.

By contrast, CBDCs are positioned as the ultimate settlement asset, backed directly by the central bank and designed to anchor trust in the monetary system.

India's government has signaled openness to exploring stablecoin regulation in its Economic Survey for 2025–2026. However, the RBI remains the more conservative voice in the room, consistently advocating restraint when it comes to crypto-linked instruments.

As the country's monetary authority, the RBI is expected to play a decisive role in shaping how digital assets are treated – particularly where they intersect with payments, capital flows, and monetary policy transmission.

The divergence highlights a familiar global tension: governments weigh innovation and competitiveness, while central banks prioritize stability and control.

Despite years of discussion, CBDC deployment remains limited. Data from the Atlantic Council shows that only Nigeria, the Bahamas, and Jamaica currently operate live CBDCs.

Dozens of other countries remain in pilot or research phases, underscoring how complex and politically sensitive CBDC implementation can be.

Meanwhile, stablecoins continue to gain traction. According to DeFiLlama, total stablecoin market capitalization climbed sharply through 2025, reflecting growing use in cross-border payments and on-chain finance – even as regulators debate their long-term role.

Alix Earle and Tom Brady got along swimmingly during their recent St. Bart's outing.

“Alix and Tom were together the entire night on New Year's Eve partying at a party hosted by Palm Tree Crew in St. Barts,” an insider told Us Weekly on Friday.

 “They met through mutual friends who were also in St. Barths and had an instant connection. There was a lot of chemistry between them.”

However, while the source claimed the influencer, 25, was “really into hanging out with” the former NFL star, 48, Earle allegedly isn't looking for “anything serious” after her split from Houston Texans player Braxton Berrios.

“It's nothing serious between her and Tom, but they were together laughing, dancing and partying, enjoying themselves,” the source shared. 

According to the insider, Earle jetted off to the celebrity hotspot island for a “needed” post-breakup getaway, as she is now “in a phase of saying yes to fun experiences and not overthinking anything.”

“She's just having fun right now and letting loose,” the insider added. “She has been in great spirits while on vacation and seems happy and ready to have fun again.”

The source told Us Weekly that Brady was “hesitant” about being seen with Earle in public, “but didn't want to leave her side.”

The Sports Illustrated swimsuit model was linked to the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback earlier this week after a source exclusively told Page Six that the pair were looking cozy “at a yacht party” in St. Barts over the holidays.

While they originally partied with their individual groups, at one point, the two stars were said to have “broke[n] off from the larger group, talking for a lot of the night” inside a private cabin.

A video of Earle and Brady looking “super close” was also published by TMZ shortly after.

Following the scene, the seven-time Super Bowl champ shared a cryptic message about “beautiful” people to his Instagram Stories.

“People are not beautiful for how they look or speak,” the quote read. “They're beautiful for how they love, care and treat others.”
