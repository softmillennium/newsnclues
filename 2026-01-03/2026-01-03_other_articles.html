                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A newly invented cipher may shed light on how the mysterious Voynich manuscript was made in medieval times. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A unique cipher that uses playing cards and dice to turn languages into glyphs produces text eerily similar to the glyphs in the Voynich manuscript, a new study shows. The Voynich manuscript, which has been radiocarbon-dated to the 15th century, contains roughly 38,000 words written in glyphs that have never been translated. Despite more than a century of intense scrutiny, the manuscript has not been explained conclusively. However, it continues to intrigue people, with its bizarre and inexplicable illustrations of plants, astrology and alchemy, including supposedly "biological" depictions of bathing naked women. "It is this fascinatingly mysterious medieval artifact," he said. Naibbe first uses the number from the throw of a die to break a block of Italian or Latin into single and double letters — so "gatto" (Italian for "cat") could become "g","at" and "to." The Voynich manuscript is named after the Polish, British and American book collector Wilfrid Voynich, who acquired it in 1912 from a collection compiled by a Jesuit college near Rome. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The manuscript now lies at a nexus of attempts to understand lost languages, yet experts are not entirely sure if Voynichese is even real. The hoax theory has grown stronger in recent years as more attempts to decipher Voynichese — some of which have used machine learning and other computerized artificial intelligence methods — have failed to crack the code, if there is a code. But theories that Voynichese is based on a real language and can be deciphered are still prominent, and Greshko's Naibbe cipher is one of the closest attempts yet. Those commonalities suggested that a similar method was used to create the original Voynich manuscript, Greshko said. "But what it does provide is a fully documented way to reliably go between Latin and something that behaves kind of like the Voynich manuscript." At one point, he thought of taking tokens from a bag — a bit like a bingo caller — but he realized that playing cards were known in Europe at that time. And while the Naibbe cipher does not faithfully replicate all features of Voynichese — such as the exact incidence of Voynichese words and where they appear in a line or paragraph — the discrepancies could be analyzed for potential relevance, he said. "My hope is that this becomes adopted as a computational benchmark," Greshko said. Former satellite engineer René Zandbergen, a renowned expert on the Voynich manuscript who was not directly involved in Greshko's study, said he appreciated Greshko's efforts to create an encoding method to approximate Voynichese. —How do we decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics and other ancient languages? —AI is deciphering a 2,000-year-old 'lost book' describing life after Alexander the Great —Mary, Queen of Scots' cryptic prison letters finally deciphered But Greshko "also makes it clear that he is not suggesting that this is how the manuscript text was generated," Zandbergen said in an email. "He just demonstrates that such a method can be found, and we may assume that there may be others."

Now, three years later, Neff is serving as one of the Trump administration's top election watchdogs. Late last year , his name began appearing on lawsuits filed by the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, listed as “acting chief” of the voting section. Neff's appointment, first reported by Mother Jones, has prompted renewed scrutiny of his work at the L.A. County district attorney's office. The Times interviewed several of Neff's former colleagues, who revealed new details about claims of misconduct that emerged from the Konnech case, and said they were alarmed that someone with almost no background in federal election law was named to a senior position. Neff led the 2022 investigation of Konnech, a tiny Michigan company whose software is used by election officials in several major cities. In a criminal complaint, Neff accused the company's CEO, Eugene Yu, of fraud and embezzlement, alleging the company stored poll worker information on a server based in China, a violation of its contract with the L.A. County registrar's office. Six weeks after a complaint was filed,  prosecutors dropped the case and launched an investigation into “irregularities” and bias in the way evidence was presented against Konnech, the D.A. The county paid Konnech $5 million and joined a motion to find Yu factually innocent as part of a legal settlement. The internal probe was focused on accusations that Neff misled supervisors at the district attorney's office about the role of election deniers in his investigation, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the case who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Neff also allegedly withheld information about potential biases in the case from a grand jury, according to the two officials. Neff's attorney also did not provide a copy of the report. A Department of Justice spokesman declined to comment. Neff's appointment comes as President Trump continues to remake the DOJ in his own image by appointing political loyalists with no criminal law background as U.S. attorneys in New Jersey and Virginia and seeking prosecutions of his political enemies, such as former FBI Director James Comey. Trump has never recanted his false claim that he won the 2020 election. 's office staff, including Gascón, when presenting the case. Gascón declined an interview request, noting he is named in Neff's pending lawsuit, which is slated for trial in early 2026. Neff's attorney insisted the case against Konnech was solid. Calls and emails to an attorney who previously represented Eugene Yu were not returned. In his lawsuit, Neff claimed he had evidence that “Konnech used third-party contractors based in China and failed to abide by security procedures” to protect L.A. County poll worker data. A DOJ spokesperson declined to describe Neff's job duties. His name appears on a number of lawsuits filed in recent months against states that have refused to turn over voter registration lists to the Trump administration. Neff is also involved in a suit filed against the Fulton County clerk's office in Georgia seeking records related to the 2020 election, records show. “We will not permit states to jeopardize the integrity and effectiveness of elections by refusing to abide by our federal elections laws,” Asst. Dhillon declined to comment through a DOJ spokesman. It does not appear that Neff has any background working on cases related to federal election law. He first became an L.A. County prosecutor in 2013 and spent years handling local crime cases out of the Pomona courthouse. He was promoted and reassigned to the Public Integrity Division, which investigates corruption issues, in 2020, according to his lawsuit. While there, he handled only two prosecutions related to elections. The other involved allegations of election rigging against a Compton city council member. In August 2021, Isaac Galvan, a Democrat, was charged with conspiring to commit election fraud after he allegedly worked to direct voters from outside his council district to cast ballots for him. Galvan won the race by just one vote, but was booted from office when a judge determined at least four improper ballots had been cast. Galvan's criminal case is still pending; he recently pleaded guilty to charges in a separate corruption and bribery case in federal court. Court filings show Neff was involved in Galvan's L.A. County case, but the prosecution was led by a more senior attorney. Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School who served in the civil rights division during the Obama administration, said section chiefs normally have decades of experience in the area of law they're meant to supervise. “The biggest problem with somebody with Neff's history is the giant screaming red flag that involves filing a prosecution based on unreliable evidence,” Levitt said. Neff's attorney, Yu, scoffed at the idea that his client was not experienced enough for his new role in the Trump administration, or that he was selected due to his involvement in the Konnech case. He didn't get the job for any other reason. “I think the Justice Department is very fortunate to have Eric.” Times Staff Writer Seema Mehta contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When people imagine first contact with aliens, they often picture giant ships in the sky or wise beings sending peaceful messages. According to astrophysicist David Kipping of Columbia University, the first extraterrestrial civilization we detect is most likely to be an extreme, unstable and very “loud” one, possibly caught in a crisis at the end of its history rather than at its calm peak. The name comes from “eschatos”, a Greek word for “last” or “final”. The first alien technosignature we pick up is unlikely to come from a typical, steady society. Instead, it will probably come from a rare civilization that briefly becomes incredibly bright in some way, either by accident or by design. To understand why, Kipping looks back at how astronomy usually works. The very first confirmed exoplanets were found in the early 1990s orbiting pulsars, a type of dead, spinning star that behaves like a cosmic lighthouse. Today we know that exoplanets around pulsars are extremely uncommon, yet they showed up first because the timing signal was so sharp that tiny changes were easy to spot. Something similar happened with so called hot Jupiters, giant planets hugging very close to their stars. Before the year 2000, a large fraction of known exoplanets fell into this category. Now we know hot Jupiters orbit less than one percent of Sun-like stars. Roughly a third of the stars you can see with the naked eye are swollen giant stars, even though only a small fraction of all stars are in that brief, late phase of their lives. A galaxy like the Milky Way only gets about two per century, yet modern surveys see thousands every year because they are so bright. Kipping argues that technosignatures from alien civilizations will follow the same pattern. In his model, he splits civilizations into quiet and loud. Quiet societies radiate at a low, steady level for most of their lifetimes. Loud ones go through a short phase when their output in some detection channel spikes to extreme levels. If loud phases are rare and short, can they still dominate what we see? The answer is yes, if they are bright enough. Using a toy model, he shows that if a civilization is loud for only one-millionth of its lifetime, then that brief episode needs to be roughly ten thousand times brighter than its quiet state to be more likely to show up in our surveys. In another example, if every society spends a tiny slice of its history in a loud phase, only about one percent of its total accessible energy budget has to be dumped into that window for such events to dominate detections. Kipping points out that technosignatures are, by definition, departures from natural equilibrium. Other researchers have already suggested that human-driven climate change, ozone destroying chemicals and industrial air pollution could all act as technosignatures on a planetary scale. In other words, a world that is heating rapidly, with carbon levels and complex pollutants climbing in its atmosphere, might look very “loud” to a distant observer. For our own species, Kipping notes that the brightest flash we could produce with current technology would likely be a global nuclear war, a completely unsustainable burst of energy. That kind of event would clearly be a terminal or near-terminal phase, not business as usual. From far away, it might be easier to notice the chemical scars of an overheating world than the quiet glow of a stable, low-impact society. Instead of focusing only on narrow, long-term signals such as radio beacons, Kipping argues that we should lean into wide-field, high-cadence surveys that watch the sky continuously. In practice, that means looking for strange changes in brightness, spectrum or apparent motion that do not fit any known natural phenomenon, rather than chasing a single, predefined type of alien beacon. Efforts that hunt for anomalies of any kind could be our best route to spotting a civilization in its loud, unstable phase. If Kipping is right, the universe may be filled with mostly quiet worlds where civilizations either stayed sustainable or faded away quietly. If someone out there is watching Earth right now, what kind of civilization do they think we are? Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.
