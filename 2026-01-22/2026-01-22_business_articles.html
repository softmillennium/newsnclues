                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're bringing you live updates from Musk and the rest of Davos here. He didn't make much of a splash. Gavin Newsom said he was "living rent-free in Trump's head," and Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco got turned away from a cloakroom for not having sufficiently high WEF status. He didn't make much of a splash. Gavin Newsom said he was "living rent-free in Trump's head," and Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco got turned away from a cloakroom for not having sufficiently high WEF status. On the geopolitical front, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked businesses to open offices in his country and got two standing ovations, while Trump formally launched his Board of Peace. Business Insider won't be liveblogging on Friday as Davos wraps up around midday local time. After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him. The billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details. The CEOs of three major banks — Citi, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs — made clear their feelings about plans to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. The bond vigilantes could make a comeback soon. Speaking to Bloomberg on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Griffin pointed to the sharp sell-off in Japan's bond market as investors balked at a potential pause on food taxes, a policy proposal that caused the nation's 40-year government bond yield to hit a record high. Speaking of Trump's journey home, Air Force One took off from Zurich Airport at 5:37 p.m. local time (11:37 a.m. Trump's convoy was seen earlier driving away from Davos before Elon Musk's speech. Speaking of Trump's journey home, Air Force One took off from Zurich Airport at 5:37 p.m. local time (11:37 a.m. Trump's convoy was seen earlier driving away from Davos before Elon Musk's speech. From touchdown to take off, the president spent about 29 hours in Switzerland. With Musk's appearance over and Trump on his way back home, we're coming into the final stretch of the 2026 World Economic Forum. Private events and cocktail parties will continue long into Thursday night, but there are only a handful of talks and discussions left today, and just a few more scheduled on Friday morning. Things will officially wrap up with closing remarks from the WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning at midday tomorrow. He talked about his vision for a robot-powered future, plans to go to Mars, and the rollout of Tesla's robotaxis. Whether he has any further engagements at Davos is currently unclear. "I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future," he says. "For quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than being a pessimist and right," he says to laughter.

"For quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than being a pessimist and right," he says to laughter. And with that, Musk's first time at Davos comes to an end. "The rate at which AI is progressing, I think we might have AI that is smarter than any human by the end of this year, and I would say no later than the end of next year." "Tesla has rolled out a robotaxi service in a few cities, and it will be very widespread by the end of this year within the US," he says. Musk says Tesla hopes to get approval for its robotaxis in Europe next month. "By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, but still deployed in an industrial environment," he adds. "By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, but still deployed in an industrial environment," he adds. "I do think it is a very solvable problem," he says. "I do think it is a very solvable problem," he says. Stopping aging isn't necessarily a good thing, he adds. "My prediction is that there will be more robots than people." "My prediction is that there will be more robots than people." "Who wouldn't want a robot to, assuming it's very safe, watch over your kids, take care of your pets?" "If we have ubiquitous AI, which is essentially free or close to it, and ubiquitous robotics, then you will have an explosion in the global economy that is truly beyond all precedent." A little piece of Venezuela," Musk says after Fink mentions Greenland. Yesterday, President Donald Trump was on the agenda for 45 minutes, and ended up speaking for nearly 90 including his brief Q&A with WEF President Børge Brende. A Greenland deal was cut, and many were feeling optimistic about the future. At a Davos panel on Thursday, moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, three robotics experts said humanoid robots needed to move beyond flashy demos and perform useful tasks in the real world at scale. Yes, a little bit of a risk, but we decided to be honest today," the Ukrainian president said to some laughs. Yes, a little bit of a risk, but we decided to be honest today," the Ukrainian president said to some laughs. As he left the stage after his speech, he got a second standing ovation from the Davos crowd. The documents ending this war are nearly there and that really matters." Hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin has a blunt message for anyone expecting artificial intelligence to instantly rewrite the global economy: the hype is real — and it's there to justify enormous spending. Speaking in Davos yesterday the Citadel CEO said the AI boom is being fueled as much by narrative as by real productivity gains. Griffin, the world's 39th richest person, said that doesn't mean AI isn't powerful — but expectations have run far ahead of reality. A previous speech, given by Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, overran significantly. Zelenskyy met with President Donald Trump prior to his speech. Flight-tracking data shows Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 has reached Zurich. It landed at 2:22 p.m. local time, some 10 hours after departing San Jose. Zelenskyy is due to speak in roughly 20 minutes. That incident sparked the WEF into publicly saying it had not invited Musk since 2015. That incident sparked the WEF into publicly saying it had not invited Musk since 2015. He was invited last year, when he was heading up Trump's shortlived Department of Government Efficiency, but did not attend. Elon Musk's private jet is back in tracking range, flying over France and about 200 miles from Zurich. Elon Musk's private jet is back in tracking range, flying over France and about 200 miles from Zurich. Perhaps ironically, Musk's jet earlier crossed paths with a Ryanair flight from Madrid to Dublin, which passed behind it by about 70 miles, with their flight paths intersecting roughly 10 minutes apart. Then, on Wednesday, the Irish airline used the beef to promote its January sale and said it would hand-deliver a ticket to X's Dublin offices. After the massive buzz around Trump's speech yesterday, things are a little lighter in terms of big name speakers at the World Economic Forum on Thursday. Still, it's Davos, so even a light day would be the envy of pretty much any other conference on earth. The day's main event, of course, is Elon Musk's appearance at 4:30 p.m. local time (10:30 a.m. Zelenskyy, who initially planned to skip Davos this year, will also meet Trump while he is in Switzerland.

Continuing our coverage of coat rooms across Davos, I was turned away from Cloakroom A in the Congress Center today. Continuing our coverage of coat rooms across Davos, I was turned away from Cloakroom A in the Congress Center today. White badges are the top dogs in Davos' weird caste system, having access to basically everything. That's followed by silver (government officials), orange (media-types like me), black (security), and finally hotel badges. There was a free coat room for us non-white-badgers just around the corner. But that didn't stop some from feeling offended. I heard one attendee who was turned down muttering "discrimination" under his breath. After leaving the Congress Hall, Trump thanked onlookers, but didn't take questions from reporters. It looks like Elon Musk is heading to Davos on his Gulfstream G650 private jet — the model of choice among the very wealthy. When I was tracking private jet arrivals on Monday, it was the most frequent type, representing 31 of 157 landings at nearby airports. According to JetSpy data, G650s that have landed near Davos this week include ones owned by: Aramco, Bill Gates, BlackRock (twice), Blackstone, The Carlyle Group, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Google, and ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

In an interview with the BBC from Davos this morning, British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said that this was in part due to "concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace when we still haven't seen any signs from Putin there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine." In an interview with the BBC from Davos this morning, British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said that this was in part due to "concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace when we still haven't seen any signs from Putin there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine." The Kremlin earlier this week said Putin had been invited to join the initiative, which is focused on overseeing Gaza as part of plans to find a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Though Trump's centerpiece appearance at Davos was his 70-minute-long speech yesterday afternoon, the president is back onstage this morning. He's launching his Board of Peace, alongside other world leaders, including Argentine President Javier Milei and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

"Just about every country wants to be a part of it," he tells the crowd. He then describes the world's troubles as "really calming down," saying: "Just one year ago, the world was actually on fire." Elon Musk's private jet is somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean as he makes a last-minute trip to Davos. The Gulfstream G650 took off from San Jose International at 7:12 p.m. PT. About six hours later, ADS-B Exchange data had it some 2,200 miles away from Zurich. Elon Musk's private jet is somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean as he makes a last-minute trip to Davos. The Gulfstream G650 took off from San Jose International at 7:12 p.m. PT. About six hours later, ADS-B Exchange data had it some 2,200 miles away from Zurich. The airplane was last recorded traveling at 660 miles per hour, which means it should land in Switzerland before 2 p.m. (8 a.m. Davos is then about a 40-minute helicopter ride away. We don't know for sure Musk is on the jet, but it seems highly likely. There has been no shortage of protests at the World Economic Forum this week, with anti-billionaire, environmental, and anti-war demonstrators seen in the town. One of the more creative demos we've seen, however, is this snow-based slogan. David Sacks spoke on Wednesday at the USA House alongside Michael Kratsios, the White House's director for science and tech policy. He pushed back on the most alarmist interpretations of Elon Musk's warnings about AI and jobs, arguing they strip out a crucial part of Musk's broader vision. According to Sacks, Musk isn't predicting a sudden mass-unemployment crisis so much as a radically different economic system, closer to a "Star Trek"-style world where technology supplies basic needs.

"Look, I think that Elon is directionally correct about the future. I think we are heading towards a country of abundance. I think that will lead to rising wages. I don't think it's going to put everyone out of work." I've usually thought of Davos as being more dominated by finance and blue-chip companies, but clearly, tech has taken over. Walking down the main thoroughfare in Davos is always fun because all the shops that are open the rest of the year are taken over this week by companies that host "houses" to showcase their brands and host clients and events. I've usually thought of Davos as being more dominated by finance and blue-chip companies, but clearly, tech has taken over. Palantir and Meta (with its free hot chocolate stand) had the most visible presence. Google was far away from the main action. Lightspeed was the only venture capital firm I saw, with its odd retro "Lighthouse." OpenAI has no house, and Sam Altman did not come, though some executives are here. I asked a couple of startup founders why they came so far to be here, and the consensus was that there's nothing like Davos for the efficiency of meeting potential customers and investors who are all packed into a tiny Swiss village for the week.

Waiting in the cold in a long line for a party for General Catalyst and Lightspeed, I asked one founder why he traveled here. He told me Alexandr Wang, founder and former CEO of Scale AI, who is now Chief AI Officer at Meta, advised him that Davos was highly useful because Wang said last year he signed almost a third of Scale's customers in the short time he was there. Harvey cofounder CEO Winston Weinberg told me that dealmaking started even before I arrived, with many transactions happening in the business-class sections of flights to Zurich from San Francisco and New York. Jamie Heller, Business Insider's editor in chief, led a panel on smart factories that dove into the future of physical AI and what's needed before robots become mainstream in homes and factory floors. Execs from Siemens, Agility Robotics, and Automation Anywhere agreed that what once sounded like a possibility in the distant future is now delivering real productivity gains.

"If you make a change, if there's something going wrong, you see real-time what's happening on the shop floor." Gavin Newsom spent most of his 30-minute interview at Davos with Semafor's editor in chief slamming President Donald Trump and the administration. Flight data from ADS-B Exchange showed that Musk's private jet, a Gulfstream G650, took off from San Jose International Airport Wednesday night, local time, and is traveling east. It's not yet clear whether Musk is on the aircraft, but he's scheduled to appear on a panel with Larry Fink at 4:30 p.m., Swiss time.

We don't need full-time managers at Cisco," he told me on Wednesday. "If in the pursuit of that change, you have to go out and reluctantly manage some people, then go ahead and do that," Patel said. "But management, in and of itself, is not a full-time job." It corresponded with escalating geopolitical situations in Venezuela and Greenland, making for a unique trip. It corresponded with escalating geopolitical situations in Venezuela and Greenland, making for a unique trip. When I spoke to them on Wednesday morning, before Trump's speech, they told me clients aren't necessarily looking to pull the plug on things, but the questions are mounting. "I think it's just raising the spectre of uncertainty, so clients aren't making any definitive assumptions at this stage," Hillery told me. "In the back of their heads, they are starting to think that this could get a lot more complicated than it's been for the last few years." "There is a bit more of a question mark now compared to the first two weeks of January," Wiltz added. There was a bit of show-and-tell from the California governor at his morning session. He took out a set of red kneepads, which he said are meant for the CEOs who kneel to Trump. The governor called Trump an "invasive species," among other things.

My reason for declining the Davos invitation was not because I thought they were engaged in diabolical scheming, but because it sounded boring af lol Musk is a new addition to the programme — he's now listed to speak with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at 4:30 p.m. Business Insider's Ben Bergman brought us to-the-minute updates from inside the room where Trump gave his speech. Great to start my day in Davos for the second day in a row with @Elex_Michaelson.Today I shared what it was like to be in the room for President Trump's lengthy address.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump sued JPMorgan Chase and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, on Thursday for closing his and related entities' accounts in early 2021 after decades of being customers of the bank, allegedly for political reasons. JPMorgan on Thursday denied that it closed Trump's accounts for political reasons, and suggested that the closures were due to federal rules and regulations that the bank has been seeking to change during this and prior presidential administrations. Trump and the other plaintiffs in the case, which are business entities related to the president, are seeking at least $5 billion in civil damages. "Plaintiffs are confident that JPMC's unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations, and JPMC's unsubstantiated, 'woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views," the lawsuit alleges. "In essence, JPMC debanked Plaintiffs' Accounts because it believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so," says the suit, which was filed in state court in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The suit also says that JPMorgan's "reckless decision is leading a growing trend by financial institutions inthe United States of America to cut off a consumer's access to banking services if their political views contradict with those of the financial institution." That purported blackist is accessible by federally regulated banks "and is comprised of individuals and entities that have a history of malfeasant acts and are otherwise non-compliant with applicable banking rules and regulations," the suit says, while stating that the plaintiffs "have always complied" with banking rules and regulations. The complaint does not give a formal name for that blacklist or indicate that it was part of a government regulatory apparatus. The complaint alleges trade libel, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by JPMorgan. It also alleges violations of Florida's Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act by Dimon. JPMorgan, in a statement to CNBC, said, "While we regret President Trump has sued us, we believe the suit has no merit." "We respect the President's right to sue us and our right to defend ourselves — that's what courts are for," said the bank's spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler. "JPMC does not close accounts for political or religious reasons." "We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company. We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so," Wexler said. "We have been asking both this Administration and prior administrations to change the rules and regulations that put us in this position, and we support the Administration's efforts to prevent the weaponization of the banking."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder's star is rising as a potential Federal Reserve chair following flattering remarks Wednesday from President Donald Trump. In a CNBC interview, Trump called Rieder "very impressive" following a recent meeting between the two. Rieder is one of a few finalists in the race to see who will succeed current Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in May. Trump also indicated that he is near a decision, with a candidate field that began at 11 now whittled "down to maybe one," the president said during the interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Rieder did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh continues to hold the lead at 45%, but that's down about 14 points from Monday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led the candidate screening, told CNBC earlier this week that he expects Trump will announce a decision next week. —Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're bringing you live updates from Musk and the rest of Davos here. After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him. The billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details. The CEOs of three major banks — Citi, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs — made clear their feelings about plans to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. The bond vigilantes could make a comeback soon. Speaking to Bloomberg on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Griffin pointed to the sharp sell-off in Japan's bond market as investors balked at a potential pause on food taxes, a policy proposal that caused the nation's 40-year government bond yield to hit a record high. Speaking of Trump's journey home, Air Force One took off from Zurich Airport at 5:37 p.m. local time (11:37 a.m. Trump's convoy was seen earlier driving away from Davos before Elon Musk's speech. Speaking of Trump's journey home, Air Force One took off from Zurich Airport at 5:37 p.m. local time (11:37 a.m. Trump's convoy was seen earlier driving away from Davos before Elon Musk's speech. From touchdown to take off, the president spent about 29 hours in Switzerland. With Musk's appearance over and Trump on his way back home, we're coming into the final stretch of the 2026 World Economic Forum. Private events and cocktail parties will continue long into Thursday night, but there are only a handful of talks and discussions left today, and just a few more scheduled on Friday morning. Things will officially wrap up with closing remarks from the WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning at midday tomorrow. He talked about his vision for a robot-powered future, plans to go to Mars, and the rollout of Tesla's robotaxis. Whether he has any further engagements at Davos is currently unclear. "I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future," he says. "For quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than being a pessimist and right," he says to laughter.

"For quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than being a pessimist and right," he says to laughter. And with that, Musk's first time at Davos comes to an end. "The rate at which AI is progressing, I think we might have AI that is smarter than any human by the end of this year, and I would say no later than the end of next year." "Tesla has rolled out a robotaxi service in a few cities, and it will be very widespread by the end of this year within the US," he says. Musk says Tesla hopes to get approval for its robotaxis in Europe next month. "By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, but still deployed in an industrial environment," he adds. "By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, but still deployed in an industrial environment," he adds. "I do think it is a very solvable problem," he says. "I do think it is a very solvable problem," he says. Stopping aging isn't necessarily a good thing, he adds. "My prediction is that there will be more robots than people." "My prediction is that there will be more robots than people." "Who wouldn't want a robot to, assuming it's very safe, watch over your kids, take care of your pets?" "If we have ubiquitous AI, which is essentially free or close to it, and ubiquitous robotics, then you will have an explosion in the global economy that is truly beyond all precedent." A little piece of Venezuela," Musk says after Fink mentions Greenland. Yesterday, President Donald Trump was on the agenda for 45 minutes, and ended up speaking for nearly 90 including his brief Q&A with WEF President Børge Brende. A Greenland deal was cut, and many were feeling optimistic about the future. At a Davos panel on Thursday, moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, three robotics experts said humanoid robots needed to move beyond flashy demos and perform useful tasks in the real world at scale. Yes, a little bit of a risk, but we decided to be honest today," the Ukrainian president said to some laughs. Yes, a little bit of a risk, but we decided to be honest today," the Ukrainian president said to some laughs. As he left the stage after his speech, he got a second standing ovation from the Davos crowd. The documents ending this war are nearly there and that really matters." Hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin has a blunt message for anyone expecting artificial intelligence to instantly rewrite the global economy: the hype is real — and it's there to justify enormous spending. Speaking in Davos yesterday the Citadel CEO said the AI boom is being fueled as much by narrative as by real productivity gains. Griffin, the world's 39th richest person, said that doesn't mean AI isn't powerful — but expectations have run far ahead of reality. A previous speech, given by Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, overran significantly. Zelenskyy met with President Donald Trump prior to his speech. Flight-tracking data shows Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 has reached Zurich. It landed at 2:22 p.m. local time, some 10 hours after departing San Jose. Zelenskyy is due to speak in roughly 20 minutes. That incident sparked the WEF into publicly saying it had not invited Musk since 2015. That incident sparked the WEF into publicly saying it had not invited Musk since 2015. He was invited last year, when he was heading up Trump's shortlived Department of Government Efficiency, but did not attend. Elon Musk's private jet is back in tracking range, flying over France and about 200 miles from Zurich. Elon Musk's private jet is back in tracking range, flying over France and about 200 miles from Zurich. Perhaps ironically, Musk's jet earlier crossed paths with a Ryanair flight from Madrid to Dublin, which passed behind it by about 70 miles, with their flight paths intersecting roughly 10 minutes apart. Then, on Wednesday, the Irish airline used the beef to promote its January sale and said it would hand-deliver a ticket to X's Dublin offices. After the massive buzz around Trump's speech yesterday, things are a little lighter in terms of big name speakers at the World Economic Forum on Thursday. Still, it's Davos, so even a light day would be the envy of pretty much any other conference on earth. The day's main event, of course, is Elon Musk's appearance at 4:30 p.m. local time (10:30 a.m. Zelenskyy, who initially planned to skip Davos this year, will also meet Trump while he is in Switzerland.

Continuing our coverage of coat rooms across Davos, I was turned away from Cloakroom A in the Congress Center today. Continuing our coverage of coat rooms across Davos, I was turned away from Cloakroom A in the Congress Center today. White badges are the top dogs in Davos' weird caste system, having access to basically everything. That's followed by silver (government officials), orange (media-types like me), black (security), and finally hotel badges. There was a free coat room for us non-white-badgers just around the corner. But that didn't stop some from feeling offended. I heard one attendee who was turned down muttering "discrimination" under his breath. After leaving the Congress Hall, Trump thanked onlookers, but didn't take questions from reporters. It looks like Elon Musk is heading to Davos on his Gulfstream G650 private jet — the model of choice among the very wealthy. When I was tracking private jet arrivals on Monday, it was the most frequent type, representing 31 of 157 landings at nearby airports. According to JetSpy data, G650s that have landed near Davos this week include ones owned by: Aramco, Bill Gates, BlackRock (twice), Blackstone, The Carlyle Group, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Google, and ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

In an interview with the BBC from Davos this morning, British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said that this was in part due to "concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace when we still haven't seen any signs from Putin there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine."

The Kremlin earlier this week said Putin had been invited to join the initiative, which is focused on overseeing Gaza as part of plans to find a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Though Trump's centerpiece appearance at Davos was his 70-minute-long speech yesterday afternoon, the president is back onstage this morning. He's launching his Board of Peace, alongside other world leaders, including Argentine President Javier Milei and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Elon Musk's private jet is somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean as he makes a last-minute trip to Davos. The Gulfstream G650 took off from San Jose International at 7:12 p.m. PT. About six hours later, ADS-B Exchange data had it some 2,200 miles away from Zurich. Elon Musk's private jet is somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean as he makes a last-minute trip to Davos.

The airplane was last recorded traveling at 660 miles per hour, which means it should land in Switzerland before 2 p.m. (8 a.m. Davos is then about a 40-minute helicopter ride away. We don't know for sure Musk is on the jet, but it seems highly likely. There has been no shortage of protests at the World Economic Forum this week, with anti-billionaire, environmental, and anti-war demonstrators seen in the town. One of the more creative demos we've seen, however, is this snow-based slogan. David Sacks spoke on Wednesday at the USA House alongside Michael Kratsios, the White House's director for science and tech policy. He pushed back on the most alarmist interpretations of Elon Musk's warnings about AI and jobs, arguing they strip out a crucial part of Musk's broader vision. According to Sacks, Musk isn't predicting a sudden mass-unemployment crisis so much as a radically different economic system, closer to a "Star Trek"-style world where technology supplies basic needs.

"Look, I think that Elon is directionally correct about the future. I think we are heading towards a country of abundance. I think that will lead to rising wages. I don't think it's going to put everyone out of work." I've usually thought of Davos as being more dominated by finance and blue-chip companies, but clearly, tech has taken over.

Palantir and Meta (with its free hot chocolate stand) had the most visible presence. Google was far away from the main action. Lightspeed was the only venture capital firm I saw, with its odd retro "Lighthouse." OpenAI has no house, and Sam Altman did not come, though some executives are here. I asked a couple of startup founders why they came so far to be here, and the consensus was that there's nothing like Davos for the efficiency of meeting potential customers and investors who are all packed into a tiny Swiss village for the week.

Waiting in the cold in a long line for a party for General Catalyst and Lightspeed, I asked one founder why he traveled here. He told me Alexandr Wang, founder and former CEO of Scale AI, who is now Chief AI Officer at Meta, advised him that Davos was highly useful because Wang said last year he signed almost a third of Scale's customers in the short time he was there. Harvey cofounder CEO Winston Weinberg told me that dealmaking started even before I arrived, with many transactions happening in the business-class sections of flights to Zurich from San Francisco and New York. Jamie Heller, Business Insider's editor in chief, led a panel on smart factories that dove into the future of physical AI and what's needed before robots become mainstream in homes and factory floors. Execs from Siemens, Agility Robotics, and Automation Anywhere agreed that what once sounded like a possibility in the distant future is now delivering real productivity gains.

"If you make a change, if there's something going wrong, you see real-time what's happening on the shop floor." Gavin Newsom spent most of his 30-minute interview at Davos with Semafor's editor in chief slamming President Donald Trump and the administration. Flight data from ADS-B Exchange showed that Musk's private jet, a Gulfstream G650, took off from San Jose International Airport Wednesday night, local time, and is traveling east. It's not yet clear whether Musk is on the aircraft, but he's scheduled to appear on a panel with Larry Fink at 4:30 p.m., Swiss time.

"But management, in and of itself, is not a full-time job." It corresponded with escalating geopolitical situations in Venezuela and Greenland, making for a unique trip.

When I spoke to them on Wednesday morning, before Trump's speech, they told me clients aren't necessarily looking to pull the plug on things, but the questions are mounting. "I think it's just raising the spectre of uncertainty, so clients aren't making any definitive assumptions at this stage," Hillery told me. "In the back of their heads, they are starting to think that this could get a lot more complicated than it's been for the last few years." "There is a bit more of a question mark now compared to the first two weeks of January," Wiltz added. There was a bit of show-and-tell from the California governor at his morning session. He took out a set of red kneepads, which he said are meant for the CEOs who kneel to Trump. The governor called Trump an "invasive species," among other things.

My reason for declining the Davos invitation was not because I thought they were engaged in diabolical scheming, but because it sounded boring af lol Musk is a new addition to the programme — he's now listed to speak with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at 4:30 p.m. Business Insider's Ben Bergman brought us to-the-minute updates from inside the room where Trump gave his speech. Great to start my day in Davos for the second day in a row with @Elex_Michaelson.Today I shared what it was like to be in the room for President Trump's lengthy address.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has accused Europe of being "lost" and trying to convince U.S. President Donald Trump to help them, rather than uniting to defend itself. "Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost trying to convince the U.S. president to change," he said in a strongly worded address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, after nearly four years of war with Russia. He had met Trump in private shortly before his speech. "Some Europeans are really strong, it's true, but many say 'we must stand strong', and they always want someone else to tell them how long they need to stand strong, preferably until the next election." Zelenskyy also revealed there would be trilateral meetings in the United Arab Emirates on Friday and Saturday involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. He added the Russians "have to be ready for compromises" for the war to end. In a week where the focus in Davos has been on U.S. threats to annex Greenland, its tariffs on European countries and a new Gaza "Board of Peace," Zelenskyy began his speech saying Europe's inaction left his country feeling like it was living through "Groundhog Day." Zelenskyy said: "Just last year here in Davos, I ended my speech with the words, 'Europe needs to know how to defend itself.' We are still in a situation where I must say the same words." "When united, we are truly invincible, and Europe can and must be a global force, not one that reacts late," he added. Trump's maneuvering on Greenland was the backdrop to many politicians' speeches at the gathering. Zelenskyy criticized the small number of soldiers NATO countries sent to the Arctic island amid Trump's threats. "If you send 30 or 40 soldiers to Greenland, what is that for? And even more importantly, what message does it send to Denmark? "You either declare that European bases will protect the region from Russia and China .... or you risk not being taken seriously, because 30 or 40 soldiers will not protect anything." Other pressing issues have been sidelined while European leaders were "waiting for America to cool down" on Greenland, Zelenskyy suggested. "There was so much talk about the protests in Iran, but they drowned in blood. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter A version of this article first appeared in the CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman, which brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media. Discovery company – its iconic movie studio, HBO Max, and its cable networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery and HGTV – may come down to what European regulators think about Netflix. That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets. If WBD shareholders accept a hostile takeover attempt from Paramount Skydance, however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it. Paramount on Thursday extended the deadline on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option. WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount. "Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump might think about a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through. And that's where either deal could fall apart. Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its "EMEA" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales. WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a "95% certainty" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's Audiovisual Media Services Directive already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works. Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies. Adobe dropped its $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was "no clear path" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority also forced Meta's Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022. It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal. Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties targeting Meta, Microsoft, Google, Apple and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it. The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have publicly expressed their displeasure with a Netflix-Warner combination. This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals," Sarandos said Tuesday during Netflix's earnings conference call. "When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval. On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison promise) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal. With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. In a corporate filing released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates. Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Adobe dropped its $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Newsom on Thursday showed off knee pads that he suggested were for leaders "selling out" to the Trump administration. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Newsom said the red knee pads were available to buy via a website he had created. Many American universities are selling out, and yes, many corporate leaders are selling out to this administration," Newsom said. "These are available in bulk, too," he said, holding up one of the knee pads, which showed U.S. President Donald Trump's signature. On Tuesday, Newsom accused world leaders of "rolling over" for Trump. "I can't take this complicity of people rolling over," Newsom said in Davos. "I should have brought a bunch of knee pads for all the world leaders," he said. A scheduled appearance by Newsom at USA House, described on its website as an "official U.S. venue" at Davos, was said to have been canceled on Wednesday soon after Trump addressed the forum. "I was going to speak last night. It was a well established event at the USA house, a simple conversation, discussion after Trump's speech. They made sure that I didn't. They made sure it was canceled," Newsom said on Thursday. USA House is privately organized and does not represent the U.S. government. It is sponsored by large companies including Microsoft, Pfizer and blockchain company Ripple. Newsom is a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate and has previously sparred with Trump.

It's a way of thinking that she expects more employers will adopt. Already, some tech companies are eager for job candidates to demonstrate their abilities by highlighting how they arrived at an answer. It's part of what appears to be a show-your-work ethos in Silicon Valley, where hefty spending on AI projects and a hangover from the pandemic-era staffing boom are driving hiring austerity in all but the hottest areas. Asking job seekers to identify a small number of concrete problems they've solved can help overcome that challenge and help bring clarity for hiring managers, she said. "They don't want to see fluffy résumés that have been written by ChatGPT," Volberg said. Asking applicants to summarize the value they would bring by sharing vignettes of success can elevate technical accomplishment over pedigree or background, she said. It's an example of what some HR types call "skills-based hiring." Musk has said that he's more focused on evidence of "exceptional" ability or achievement. He also requested bullet points in 2025 when he oversaw efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency group to remake swaths of the US federal government. A nearly year-old post on X said that DOGE was seeking "world-class" software engineers, product managers, and data scientists, among other roles. She said that it's often immediately clear to tech recruiters whether someone has actually done the work they describe. Candidates who exaggerate or fabricate their accomplishments are likely to be found out — and potentially blacklisted, Volberg said. Beyond candidate chicanery, there could be other risks to Musk's strategy, said David Murray, CEO of Confirm, a San Francisco startup focused on reinventing performance reviews. Asking people to submit summaries of their greatest tech wins could mean that an employer like Tesla misses out on the quiet contributors and introverts who might not do as good a job promoting themselves, he told Business Insider. Bullets of key achievements — even more than with a typical résumé — require people to make the case for their own work. Murray said that Musk's approach also overlooks the impacts of the so-called Dunning-Kruger effect, in which people who aren't great at something tend to overestimate their abilities, and those who are ace might assume a task is easy for anyone.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oracle and OpenAI have aimed to build $500 billion of data centers by the end of the decade to power their artificial intelligence ambitions. JPMorgan Chase, the bank that recently led a pack of lenders to extend roughly $38 billion of debt for the construction of two planned Stargate data center campuses in Texas and Wisconsin, has encountered diminished interest as it has sold off pieces of the loan to other financial players, a person familiar with the situation said. But the person acknowledged that banks and institutional investors had also grown wary in recent months of taking on too much exposure to Oracle, a tech giant whose credit rating sits below some of its peers in the AI race, including Microsoft and Google. "We are hearing from market participants that in some cases, there may be banks that could be approaching the exposure levels they're comfortable with when it comes to certain data center projects," said Dhaval Shah, a director at S&P Global Infrastructure Ratings. The current unprecedented data center development cycle has been dominated by just a handful of leading players, testing whether lenders and investors will remain willing to continue to accrue heavy exposure to borrowers like Oracle. In November, credit default swaps that insure against losses on Oracle's corporate debt rose in cost, a reflection of the concerns around the company's enormous spending on AI. "Oracle has become a proxy for OpenAI's ability to raise significant amounts of capital," said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson. Much of the financing for the project, so far, has been provided by major financial institutions that have banded together to share its immense costs — as well as its risks — in what are known as syndication deals. JPMorgan Chase and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group led the syndication effort for the two Stargate projects in Shackelford, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin. Bank of America is leading a syndication to finance another Stargate data center campus in Michigan. Initial players in large syndication deals often seek to sell off portions of their loan commitments to other players, including other banks and institutional investors. But the sale of these positions, which is done to reap quick profits and lower exposure, has become trickier in the case of Stargate. Two bankers and a financing executive who are familiar with the syndication market said that the rising perception of risk around Stargate meant that lenders now wanted higher yields to lend to it. That has placed recent Stargate syndicators in a position where they can no longer profitably sell off debt that was arranged at tighter spreads just a few months ago. Stargate borrowing rates may not come down any time soon. In September, S&P Global Ratings affirmed Oracle's rating at BBB but said it was considering a cut due to the company's enormous planned spending on AI infrastructure. "I am very surprised these loans were even underwritten at the time," Luria said. "The market has indicated this is not investment-grade debt." However, Luria said one scenario in particular could make the loans less risky. OpenAI is now in the process of trying to raise as much as $100 billion, according to reports, giving the Stargate venture a potential cushion of equity and making its debt easier to sell, he said. "If that happens," he said, "everybody's dreams come true." "Do we have enough digestive capacity" in the market for investors to buy all of the debt that will be required, said David Tawil, a partner at transaction insurance advisory firm Castle Harbour.</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Fisayo Che, the founder of women's wear brand Elisamama. Business Insider has verified Che's statements, including the amount Saks owes, with documentation she provided. Saks Global filed in January for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which allows it to continue operating while undergoing a court-supervised reorganization of its debt. In a statement, Saks said it is committed to "trusted relationships with brand partners," and that funding it secured through the bankruptcy will "facilitate go-forward payments to brand partners." My family is from Nigeria, and I spent time there growing up. At first, I sold the clothing at flea markets; later, I listed on Etsy and promoted it on social media. Saks really gave my business a platform to grow. Now, it's going through bankruptcy and hasn't paid me for some of my inventory. I'm not sure how to trust the company going forward. In the fall of 2020, someone found us on Instagram and, unbeknownst to me, dropped our name with a Saks buyer. Then, a vice president from the company DM'd me on Instagram. I thought: How are we going to do this? It was rapid-fire learning, trying to understand all the vendor requirements, including shipping and routing guidelines. Everybody was winning; it helped us help other people grow their own businesses. In 2023, Saks selected us to join its New Wave program for emerging designers. We came to New York, connected with industry experts and the press, and the company gave us a grant. At the end, we had our products placed in the window at Saks' flagship store in New York. That was a remarkable moment for me and my team in Nigeria, who are so proud of this work. It was nothing that I could even have imagined for Elisamama. Things were ramping up, and the more I did this work, the more joy I found in it. Saks has been a great partner to us. It has placed orders with us every season since 2020. The problems started in February of last year, when Saks sent vendors a memo about paying in installments. Prior to that, we were consistently paid on the agreed-upon payment terms. I thought: We can wait a few months to get paid. I thought we were back on track and kept sending inventory. The company kept saying it would get back to us with updates. I'm considering cutting half of our team to stay viable. I employ 20 people full time in Nigeria; we have some consultants and contractors, as well. The amount Saks owes us means a lot. When Saks' bankruptcy was announced in January, the ax dropped. Because of the proceedings, Saks said it'd prioritize debts incurred after January 13 and get back to us on other payments owed. I have been trying to expand my partnerships and sales channels to protect my business, as we've been hearing about Saks' struggles for a long time. We're sitting on Saks' most recent order, given the situation. I've told the buyers that any future shipments would have to be paid for before we ship. I'm also considering asking them to send back the inventory they have on hand, so at least we can cut our losses. What's happened is a disappointment, but it's also grief and sadness. Do you have a story to share about Saks?</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Derek Fulton, 31, a former Nvidia software engineer who quit to found the North Carolina-based cloud startup Carolina Cloud with his wife. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment about its work culture. The following has been edited for length and clarity. When a friend from college who worked at Nvidia posted on LinkedIn about a software engineering opportunity, I knew I had to apply. I've always been a technologist at heart, and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to see what all the fuss was about. It was the first time I was on a team where software was the final product and not just an internal tool — where getting the last mile right really mattered. My package was in the low six figures, and the wide disparities in pay between older and newer employees impacted the culture because we were all playing different games. I joined late enough that the money wasn't life-changing, and I felt I could get another job that paid roughly the same amount if it ever came to that. Also, our cost of living is reasonable in the Raleigh-Durham area, and my wife and I are both pretty fiscally shrewd. One of my ambitions was to command my own time by the age of 30 and to have kids who could grow up seeing me do that every day. We're bootstrapping for now, but aren't opposed to raising a small round down the line if we fill our current server fleet. Carolina Cloud does offer GPUs, but we're focused on CPUs because we believe they absolutely aren't going anywhere: they're less finicky, use less power, are cheaper, and last for years. At previous jobs where we'd rented cloud, the prices were so high compared to what I knew it would cost to actually build one of the computers, so I saw an opportunity to create a provider that delivered value while still making money. Carolina Cloud is focused on on-demand, high-performance compute. Some of our early customers are hedge funds and genomics companies, particularly in the Research Triangle. We differentiate from hyperscalers with lower pricing, no egress fees, and high-touch support. After a couple of weeks, I started sleeping better, chatting with strangers in public, spontaneously running errands I'd forgotten about, and calling people I hadn't thought about in years. I've also been working really hard, but on my own terms, which has allowed me to reconnect with my love for technology. While it takes time to get a business off the ground, I told myself that if we didn't turn a profit in 18 months, I could go back to a traditional job. But right now, early interest has gone as expected and indicates that we should be able to stay the course.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ghana is accelerating its industrialisation drive with a renewed focus on electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, as the government moves to create jobs, attract foreign investment, and strengthen the country's competitiveness in clean transport. The push builds on earlier engagements with Chinese automakers and has now entered a more advanced phase. Speaking at the Government Accountability Series on January 21, 2026, Minister of Trade, Agribusiness and Industry Elizabeth Ofosu-Adjare said the government had signed a memorandum of understanding with China's Shenzhen New Jekyll to establish an EV assembly plant in Ghana. “They are already in Ghana, they have acquired land, and development is far advanced for the factory to begin operations,” Ofosu-Adjare said, signalling that the project has moved beyond preliminary negotiations. She added that the ministry is also in discussions with Chery International, one of China's major automobile exporters, to set up an additional EV assembly plant following engagements at the China-Africa Summit. The talks highlight growing interest from global automakers in Ghana's emerging EV market. Ghana's EV ambitions form part of a broader strategy to reposition the country as a manufacturing hub in West Africa while supporting its climate and energy transition goals. Transport remains a major source of emissions in Ghana's urban centres, and policymakers see EV adoption as a way to reduce fuel imports, cut emissions, and build local industrial capacity. China dominates the global EV supply chain, from battery technology to affordable vehicle production, and is increasingly targeting emerging markets as growth slows in Europe and North America. Industry analysts note that the success of Ghana's EV push will depend on scaling power infrastructure, expanding charging networks, and keeping EVs affordable for consumers.
