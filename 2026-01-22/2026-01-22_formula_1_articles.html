                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stella explains McLaren approach to 2026 with every team starting ‘from zero' Temple details McLaren preparations ahead of new 2026 regulations For Doriane Pin there has only been one target at the forefront of her mind – to win. Never one to blend in, Pin was destined to stand out from the moment she first set foot in a kart aged seven. As her nickname of ‘Pocket Rocket' attests to, Pin was a driver you should never underestimate. However, when Mercedes offered her the chance to represent them in F1 ACADEMY, it was a chance she was determined to repay with the title. “Champion is a beautiful word to really fit our season,” she summarises. Storming onto the scene with victory on her F1 ACADEMY debut in Jeddah, Pin had every intention of claiming the 2024 crown with PREMA Racing. Entering the 2025 F1 season, it was clear that Pin had unfinished business to take care of. As a title favourite, the weight of expectation fell heavy on her shoulders. Her competition was no less fierce, as Ferrari junior Maya Weug went back-and-forth with Pin for the top spot. “She's talented and very much deserves her success this year. It was a close battle that I actually enjoyed a lot, because you need those drivers to push you and push each other to the top. We did exactly that so it was really positive.” Taking the Standings lead with a daring first lap pass on Weug in Shanghai Race 2, Pin lost the top spot one round later, a position she refused to accept. Recognising that she needed to step up her game, the Mercedes junior left no stone unturned as she drove herself to be better than ever. Her impeccable consistency was built on rapid speed and a sharp intellect, choosing her moments wisely – not least her outstanding performance going from sixth to the victory in Miami Race 1. It was not easy at all but we were still there performing on Sunday. Even her behaviour behind the scenes takes lessons from those that have gone before her, with her journal recording car and session details reminiscent of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. “Just being in the present,” Pin responds when asked about her mentality last season. “Winning and fighting for a title for the whole year hasn't been easy because when you're leading, you're the one to beat. I'm very happy about this weekend especially, because we have been very ahead of our contenders in terms of approach. It's clearly making a difference because we are champions.” On hand to celebrate the title with her in Las Vegas were Mercedes, as the Formula 1 team poured into parc ferme wearing custom ‘P1N' shirts. George Russell, Kimi Antonelli and Toto Wolff were amongst the first to congratulate her and the Team Principal was full of praise for their young star. “Dori has been a great addition to the team,” he remarked in the Mercedes End of Year Review video. "But then she went into [F1 ACADEMY] and crushed it. She's a fierce young lady that can drive. From a personality, she fits into Mercedes, she fits into the team and it's a pleasure to see her working." “Mercedes have been there from day one,” she says. They bring professionalism, experience and performance into my racing career. I will remember it for my entire life.” As the next stage awaits, with duties as a Mercedes Development Driver soon to come for the 22-year-old, Pin's aspirations know no bounds. With a versatility that should stand her in good stead for any path she chooses, the opportunities are endless. Savouring all she's learnt across her two seasons in F1 ACADEMY, her childhood dream is as alive as ever. "Every day you learn something so it's super fascinating when you're passionate about motorsport and the high level of sport. "I've learned so much in terms of driving, but also outside the track and on myself as well. She adds: “The idea is to have a long and successful career. Hopefully we will achieve good things with everyone who is involved at the moment with me […] I've grown so much, it will definitely help me in my entire career. "F1 ACADEMY and everything around it is big and I will never give up on achieving my ultimate goal – that's Formula 1.”</p>

The Silver Arrows, who fought back to finish second in the Teams' Championship last year, will run an unchanged line-up of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli this season. The W17, like all its rivals, will be smaller, narrower and lighter than its predecessor as it has been designed and built to sweeping new aerodynamic regulations. “Formula 1will undergo significant change in 2026, and we are prepared for that transition," said Team Principal and CEO Toto Wolff. "The new regulations demand innovation and absolute focus across every area of performance. We will continue to push hard in the months ahead." The eight-time world champions will then host a season launch event with their drivers, senior personnel and the W17 on February 2. Afterwards, the squad will then head to Bahrain for official pre-season testing, with two three-day tests planned for teams to refine their cars and start to chase performance.</p>
