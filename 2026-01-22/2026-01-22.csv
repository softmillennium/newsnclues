            The Trump administration has ordered a review of federal funding sent to more than a dozen Democratic-led states, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.
    


            The sweeping scale of the review is outlined in a budget data request that was sent Tuesday to all federal departments and agencies except for the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
    


            The Office of Management and Budget memo, which was reviewed by CNN, requests detailed spending information to “facilitate efforts to reduce the improper and fraudulent use of those funds.” Notably, the effort “does not involve withholding funds,” the memo says and is “part of a “data-gathering exercise.”
    


            The request signals a dramatic escalation of the Trump administration's increasingly aggressive strategy to target federal funding in blue states – an unprecedented policy approach triggered during last year's government shutdown that has rapidly accelerated in the wake of sweeping fraud allegations in Minnesota.
    


            OMB Director Russel Vought has run point on the effort after spending President Donald Trump's past year in office re-engineering tools used by the agency, known as the federal government's “nerve center,” to exert new authority and power over the federal spending process.
    


            The memo directs agencies to include in their spending reports all grants, loans, contracts, subcontracts and “other monetary awards” provided to 13 states and Washington, DC. All of the states voted for Democratic nominee and former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and 12 of the 13 states have Democratic governors. A fourteenth Democratic-led state has since been included in the review, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


            The request directs agencies to include funding data on the states as well as their localities, institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations operating or performing award activities there. The administration's plan to review the funding was first reported by RealClearPolitics.
    


            The review is an expansion of an ongoing effort to build a full accounting of government spending in those states and will give the Trump administration options for how to address what they see as waste or abuse, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
    


            That effort also includes options to counter blue-state policies that go against the administration's priorities, most notably on funding related to so-called “sanctuary cities,” the people said.
    


            It also comes as Trump officials focus on the Minnesota welfare fraud scandal, and as the Justice Department works to create a new division of prosecutors and investigators focused on national fraud enforcement. CNN has reported that the White House recently pushed the FBI to investigate political campaigns in Minnesota over whether they illegally benefited from the fraud.
    


            Vice President JD Vance is scheduled to visit the state later today.
    


            Federal agencies have until Monday to provide data on California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Washington, DC, the budget data request shows.
    


            Virginia wasn't listed in the original memo, but has since been included in the review, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


            They are being asked to hand over data on all grants, loans, cooperative agreements, contracts and other financial awards including those made to colleges and universities, the request states. Information should cover fiscal years 2025 and 2026, as well as projected spending for 2027, the memo says.
    


            With Minnesota's scandals in the spotlight, the Trump administration has doubled down on its efforts to investigate fraud in federal support to states – particularly blue states – and often without evidence.
    


            Earlier this month, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced it would freeze $10 billion in federal childcare and social assistance funding to five Democratic-led states – California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York – suggesting the funds could have been subject to fraud. The states quickly sued, arguing the agency has not provided any evidence of fraud and saying the move would hurt many low-income families and children. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that is keeping the money flowing for now.
    


            A federal judge has also temporarily halted the US Department of Agriculture's recent demand that Minnesota re-certify the eligibility of more than 100,000 food stamp enrollees in four counties within 30 days or face steep penalties, including possible disqualification from the program and a halt of federal administrative funding. In a letter to the state in December, the agency cited a multimillion dollar fraud scheme involving a USDA Covid-19 pandemic child nutrition relief program.
    


            HHS said earlier this month that it would freeze federal child care payments to Minnesota and require all states to justify their spending of HHS funding before the money is released.
    


            Trump has also vowed to cut off funding to sanctuary cities, a longtime target of his ire.
    


            “Starting February 1, we're not making any payments to sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens,” Trump said last week in an economic speech in Detroit. “And it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come with it.”
    


            His previous efforts to stop funding to these jurisdictions have been repeatedly halted by courts.

            Jenna Scott remembers the joy of being pregnant with her first and only child. She also remembers the immense abdominal pain.
    


            During her pregnancy, she let her doctors know about the persistent discomfort. She was told it was normal, that the aches “came with the territory,” she said.
    


            But after she delivered a healthy baby boy, the pain didn't fade. It lingered.
    


            More than a year later, Scott received a diagnosis that shook her sense of normalcy: stage 4 colon cancer. She was 31 years old at the time.
    


            “We did a colonoscopy and when I woke up, there was my husband, my doctor and four nurses in the room. The GI doctor said he didn't need to send anything off to pathology to know that I had cancer,” Scott, now 39, said in an email.
    


            Stage 4 cancer, also known as metastatic cancer, means the cancer has spread from its original location to other parts of the body. For Scott, she said the disease spread from her colon to her liver.
    


            “I've always been super fit and healthy. I've been an athlete all my life. I didn't even grow up eating red meat. In an instant, my life changed completely and unexpectedly,” she said. “I was in a state of disbelief because that word ‘cancer' didn't live in my world. Cancer means death.”
    


            In a concerning trend, colorectal cancer now appears to be the deadliest cancer for young adults.
    


First-of-its-kind study may help explain why colorectal cancers are rising sharply in young people



            Colorectal cancer has surpassed other cancer types to become the leading cause of cancer deaths among people under 50 in the United States, as of 2023, according to new research published Thursday in the medical journal JAMA.
    


            Deaths from colon and rectal cancers in the under-50 age group rose by 1.1% annually since 2005, the research found. Because of this rise, colorectal cancer went from being the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths among people younger than 50 in the early 1990s to becoming the top cause in 2023.
    


            “We don't know why it is increasing,” said Dr. Ahmedin Jemal, senior vice president of surveillance, prevention and health services research at the American Cancer Society and senior author of the new study.
    


            “Mortality for the other major causes of cancer deaths in young adults under 50 is declining. It is only colorectal cancer mortality that is increasing, but we really don't know fully what contributes to this rising burden,” he said.
    


More young people are getting early-onset colorectal cancer. 5 things to know



            Scott, an advocate for the nonprofit Colorectal Cancer Alliance, also finds the new research troubling.
    


            After years of treatment – which included chemotherapy medications, targeted therapy and surgery – she is now in stable condition, but she said that she must “continue chemotherapy and targeted therapy indefinitely,” because each time she has stopped treatment before, the cancer came back and spread further to other organs in her body.
    


            As she now continues treatment, Scott said that her goal is to “become a grandmother one day.”
    


            For the new research, Jemal and his colleagues at the American Cancer society analyzed the annual numbers and rates of cancer deaths among people under 50 in the United States from 1990 through 2023, based on data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.
    


            “It's the most complete data we have,” Jemal said.
    


            The researchers examined the five leading causes of cancer death among the under-50 age group. They found that overall, from 1990 through 2023, more than 1.2 million people died of cancer in the United States before age 50, and the death rate fell by 44% during that time.
    


            The data also showed that deaths decreased for every leading cancer type, except for colorectal cancer.
    


            Among the five leading causes of cancer death in people under 50, the average annual decline in deaths from 2014 through 2023 was 0.3% for brain cancer, 1.4% for breast cancer, 2.3% for leukemia and 5.7% for lung cancer, according to the data.
    


            The research findings suggest that as of 2023, the top five causes of cancer deaths among people younger than 50 in the United States were:
    


            “We weren't expecting colorectal cancer to rise to this level so quickly, but now it is clear that this can no longer be called an old person's disease,” Jemal said in a news release.
    


            “We must double down on research to pinpoint what is driving this tsunami of cancer in generations born since 1950,” he added. “In the meantime, people 45-49 years make up fifty percent of diagnoses under 50, so increased screening uptake will prevent disease as well as death.”
    


As more young people get screened, more colon cancer is being found early. Here's how to lower your risk



            As a young adult with colorectal cancer, Scott said that the research findings were “pretty disturbing” for her.
    


            “What has to happen to draw more awareness to this disease and the people who are mostly being affected by it today? Why are seemingly healthy adults and children continuing to die from this disease? Why are women becoming more and more affected? How do you prevent something when you nor your team of doctors know how you got it in the first place?” Scott said in the email. “We have to stop this increase in mortality.”
    


            There are nearly 60 new colorectal cancer cases diagnosed in people under 50 each day in the United States, according to the Colorectal Cancer Alliance — that's a diagnosis about every 25 minutes.
    


            The new research is an important reminder for people under 50 to stay up-to-date on their cancer screenings, Jemal said. It's recommended for people at average risk of colorectal cancer to start regular screening at age 45.
    


            Yet “only 37% of adults ages 45 to 49 are up-to-date for their colorectal cancer screening,” Jemal said.
    


            “Colorectal cancer screening can not only detect cancer at the early stage, but also it removes the polyps before it becomes cancer,” he said. “So, it's one of the two screening types that we have that not only detects cancer at early stage but also prevents it, the other being cervical cancer screening.”
    


Reduce your risk of colon and rectal cancer with these basic steps



            The new research is “timely” and highlights a “red flag,” said Dr. Y. Nancy You, professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and director of its Young-onset Colorectal Cancer Program, who was not involved in the new paper.
    


            But while screening for colorectal cancer among healthy younger adults with no symptoms is critically important, “that's only part of the story. I think there is a tremendous gap – and opportunity – in expeditiously diagnosing and treating people who are already symptomatic,” You said.
    


            Common symptoms of colorectal cancer include:
    


            “There is an unmeasurable group of young adults who have symptoms that may be consistent with colorectal cancer, but either sit on the symptoms because they are busy or are scared, or eventually access their health care system but encounter a provider who thinks it's just a hemorrhoid and doesn't trigger further investigations,” You said, referring to when patients' symptoms sometimes get dismissed by their providers.
    


            “So, there are definitely delays in diagnosing young adults who are already symptomatic.”
    


Regular aspirin use may help lower risk of colorectal cancer, study finds, especially for those with unhealthy lifestyles



            When there are delays in diagnosing cancer, it becomes more likely that the disease will be diagnosed at later stages, such as stage 3 or 4. When cancer is at an advanced stage, it may have spread beyond the tumor itself into surrounding regions or other parts in the body, making it more difficult to treat and the patient becomes less likely to survive, regardless of age.
    


            That's why the increase in colorectal cancer deaths appears to be happening at a time when more people under 50 are being diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, said Dr. Andrea Cercek, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who was not involved in the new research.
    


            For colorectal cancer, “those under 45 are not screened, so they're not diagnosed until they have symptoms. In many of those, about three-fourths, those symptoms are actually because they have much more advanced disease, and then the outcomes are worse, regardless of their age,” Cercek said, adding that the new research highlights a greater need to diagnose young patients quickly and not dismiss their symptoms because of age.
    


FDA approves blood test for colorectal cancer screening among average-risk adults in the US



            It's estimated that more than 60% of colorectal cancer patients under 50 are diagnosed after the disease has already advanced to stage 3 or 4.
    


            “In this younger group, when we do see later stage of diagnosis, that is highly associated with lower survival,” said Christine Molmenti, an associate professor and cancer epidemiologist at Northwell Health in New York, who was not involved in the new research.
    


            “I've met a lot of patients under 50 with this disease, and I think it is very heartbreaking,” she said. “Anecdotally, what we see a lot of times is that these patients are healthy. They're fit. Sometimes they're athletes. There were a couple of patients who had not survived the disease, but their parents told us that they ran a marathon four months before their stage 4 colon cancer diagnosis. And often times young people ignore symptoms, or their symptoms are dismissed. So, I think there needs to be awareness.”

            President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reached a verbal understanding about Greenland during their meeting on Wednesday, but no document has been produced yet memorializing a future deal, people familiar with their discussion told CNN.
    


            Trump and Rutte agreed to further discussions about updating a 1951 agreement between the US, Denmark and Greenland that governs the US military's presence on the island, the sources said. The deal framework also guarantees that Russia and China will be barred from any investments in Greenland and lays out an enhanced role for NATO in Greenland, they said.
    


            Two of the sources said another element of a possible deal is increased US access to Greenland's natural resources, including its mineral reserves. But Rutte on Thursday denied that he had discussed this issue with Trump directly.
    


Five takeaways from Trump's antagonistic speech in Davos



            The White House said previously that details of the plan would be released as they are finalized, and a spokeswoman repeated that Thursday.
    


            “If this deal goes through, and President Trump is very hopeful it will, the United States will be achieving all of its strategic goals with respect to Greenland, at very little cost, forever. President Trump is proving once again he's the Dealmaker in Chief. As details are finalized by all parties involved, they will be released accordingly,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly.
    


            CNN has reached out to Rutte's office for comment.
    


            One person familiar with the discussions said Rutte did not want any formal documents prepared during his meeting with Trump because he was concerned they could leak — or be posted by Trump himself on social media. Trump earlier this week posted a private message Rutte sent to him ahead of their talks.
    


            But the lack of any written documentation has caused some confusion among NATO allies about what was actually agreed upon. A document detailing the specific terms of a new deal is expected to be hammered out at the next meeting of the US-Denmark-Greenland working group, which was established last week after Danish and Greenlandic officials met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance, two of the sources said. That meeting could happen as soon as next week in Washington, DC, one of the sources said.
    


            NATO officials had also previously floated the idea that Denmark could allow the US to build more military bases in Greenland that would be constructed on land considered sovereign US territory, a NATO official told CNN. But Danish officials said there have been no direct discussions between Denmark and the US about the possibility of granting the US sovereign parcels of land, and a NATO spokesperson said Rutte did not discuss it with Trump on Wednesday.
    


            “NATO is fully aware of the Kingdom of Denmark's position,” Denmark's prime minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement on Thursday. “We can negotiate on everything political; security, investments, economy. But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty. I have been informed that this has not been the case.”

US President Donald Trump's bid to acquire Greenland from Denmark echoes another land transaction between the two nations – one that ultimately benefited Jeffrey Epstein.

In 1917, Washington paid Copenhagen $25 million in gold (roughly $633 million today) for part of the West Indies, now known as the US Virgin Islands. The sale included a small island called Little Saint James, which was purchased in 1998 by Epstein, a financier with alleged intelligence ties and extensive connections to global elites, including Trump.

Epstein was disgraced for sexually abusing girls and died in a prison cell while awaiting trial. US authorities maintain he committed suicide.

Notably, the original Virgin Islands sale included a US pledge not to object to Danish “political and economic interests to the whole of Greenland.”

By Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, and research director of the Valdai International Discussion Club.

By Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, and research director of the Valdai International Discussion Club.

“What we are about to do here is a neighborly act. We are like a group of householders, living in the same locality, who decide to express their community of interests by entering into a formal association for their mutual self-protection.”

That was US President Harry Truman on April 4, 1949, at the signing of the Washington Declaration creating NATO. It is an effective metaphor, and a convincing one. But it can also be turned around.

In a recent Fox News interview about Greenland, US Permanent Representative to the UN Michael Waltz remarked: “Denmark just doesn't have the resources or capacity to do what needs to be done in the northern region. And to the Democrats who say ‘they're giving you full access,' everybody knows if you're renting a place you treat it differently than if you own it.”

You can't really argue with that either. Ownership is more reliable than contractual relationships, which assume goodwill. Goodwill exists today and disappears tomorrow. Legal ownership also confers rights that a temporary user does not have. In relation to Greenland, this is a question of the Arctic shelf. If the US were to formally own the world's largest island, the question of redistributing influence in the Far North would not be raised between NATO and Moscow (currently, all Arctic powers except Russia are NATO members), but between the US and everyone else.

This spring NATO will celebrate its 77th anniversary. That is a respectable age for an international organization, but modest by historical standards. Experience teaches that no structure exists forever.

Still, statements by Western European politicians suggesting that a direct conflict between the US and Denmark could lead to “the end of NATO” are meant to terrify everyone involved. The implied claim is that this would bring about the collapse of the world order.

The perception is understandable. Since the mid-20th century NATO has played a structuring role in the international system: first as part of the institutional basis of the Cold War, and later as the main ideological and political pillar of the liberal world order. There are few people left who remember international politics without a unified political West.

But before the post-war period such a phenomenon did not exist. The transformation of the USSR into a superpower created a “Western community” that consolidated ideologically as the “free world,” in addition to its military component. The successful conclusion of the Cold War for the West then established the North Atlantic community as a prototype for the international order as a whole. At the very least, the problems with the architecture of European security that have led to the current military confrontation have their roots in that period. It was decided then that the only correct security system for Europe was one centered on NATO, and that the unlimited expansion of the bloc was the key to stability. The result is clear.

Nevertheless, NATO is a product of a specific time: the Cold War and its immediate aftermath in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. That period has now ended.

All institutions from the second half of the last century are experiencing crises of varying severity, including even such a heavyweight as the UN. It would be unusual if an organization as prominent as NATO were an exception. The reason for the decline in organizational functionality lies not so much in internal problems, but in the fundamental change in the international situation.

Trump's successor, Joe Biden, attempted to recreate the Cold War scenario by pitting Ukraine against Russia in a major ideological conflict between the “free” and “unfree” worlds, thereby establishing American dominance. In terms of NATO cohesion, Western Europe was willing to join in for a while. However, Trump's return derailed the initiative.

During his first term, Trump made no secret of his dissatisfaction with NATO. At that time, his criticism resembled that of previous American presidents, who also said European members should make a greater financial contribution to collective security. Those same Europeans reluctantly agreed to increase spending. Now the US is addressing the issue directly: the US does not really need NATO for security purposes, and Western Europe should develop its own defense capabilities by purchasing everything it needs from the US. That would require increased military spending.

Will NATO come to an end? For now, Western Europe seems to be panicking about losing American patronage because it does not know how to proceed militarily or politically.

It seems unlikely the White House would forcibly seize Greenland, since that would be unpopular both in Greenland and in the US. So it is more likely that a conciliatory stance will be adopted. For now, it is possible to blame everything on one particular tyrant in the hope that things will change after he is gone. But the atmosphere inside the “group of householders,” to use Truman's metaphor, is already changing. It will not return to what it was before.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Ukraine peace talks down to one sticking point","https://www.rt.com/news/631334-witkoff-ukraine-peace-one-issue/","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 12:33:00 GMT","

The Ukraine peace talks have been narrowed down to a single unresolved issue, according to US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who said he would travel to Moscow later on Thursday. The trip was later confirmed by the Kremlin.

Speaking at an impromptu ‘Ukraine Breakfast' on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Witkoff said he felt “encouraged” and “optimistic” about the progress so far.

“If both sides want to solve this, we're going to get it solved. I think we've made a lot of progress,” he said. “I think we've got it down to one issue, and we have discussed iterations of that issue, and that means it's solvable.”

Witkoff did not specify the remaining sticking point, but he had previously suggested it relates to territory. Russia has demanded that Ukraine abandon claims to the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, as well as the Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions – four territories that joined Russia in 2022 following referendums. Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has rejected recognizing the regions as part of Russia, though he said last month that a referendum on possible territorial concessions could be held.

US President Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday that Moscow and Kiev were “reasonably close” to a settlement and “at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done.” 

Trump met with Zelensky in Davos on Thursday. The sit-down lasted less than an hour, and was not followed by a press conference. Despite naming “Zelensky” as the main impediment to a peace deal last week, Trump told reporters that the Davos meeting was “good,” and that he hopes “it's going to end.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday morning that the US delegation, which will also include Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, is expected in Moscow by 8 pm local time (5 pm GMT), with a meeting with Putin scheduled immediately afterward. He added that the talks will cover the Ukrainian settlement and “other related topics,” but declined to comment on the progress of negotiations.

At a Thursday morning meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Putin revealed that he also plans to discuss contributing funds to Trump's Board of Peace with the US delegation – an initiative created to support Gaza's recovery after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. Trump invited dozens of nations to join the board, including Russia. Putin suggested using Russian assets frozen in the US for the contribution.

“We have discussed such options previously with representatives of the US administration, and a meeting and discussion on this topic is planned for later today in Moscow,” Putin stated.

MOSCOW, January 22. /TASS/. /TASS/. The Board of Peace could become one of the most consequential organizations in the world, US President Donald Trump has stated at the ceremony establishing the new structure in Davos, Switzerland.

MOSCOW, January 22. /TASS/. Officers of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) have detained an agent of Moldovan intelligence services in Moscow who came to carry out an assignment detrimental to Russia's security, the FSB's press service reported.

""It has been established that in December 2025, a Russian citizen entered Moscow with the purpose of carrying out a task for the Information and Security Service of the Republic of Moldova, directed against Russia's security, during the preparation of which he was detained by officers of the Federal Security Service,"" the press service stated. Correspondence with an employee of the Moldovan intelligence service was found on his seized communication devices, confirming these circumstances.

The FSB's Investigative Directorate has initiated a criminal case based on signs of a crime under article 275.1 of Russia's criminal code (confidential cooperation with a foreign state, international or foreign organization), and a preventive measure in the form of detention has been imposed. The article provides for up to 8 years of imprisonment. ""The detainee is confessing. An investigation is underway,"" the FSB noted.

""This is not the first instance where the intelligence services of the Republic of Moldova, despite receiving financial and advisory support from Western patrons and despite the high probability of exposure, have infiltrated their agents into Russia,"" the Federal Security Service noted.

Former special counsel gives evidence on his handling of two federal investigations into Trump

Jack Smith testifies evidence showed Trump crimes in 2020 election effort

In his opening remarks today, House judiciary committee chair Jim Jordan slammed Jack Smith and his two failed investigations into the president.

“It was always about politics and to get president Trump. They were willing to do just about anything,” Jordan said.

He maintained that the probes into the president were part of a scheme to prevent Trump's re-election. Jordan repeated the ruling by judge Aileen Cannon – who dismissed the classified documents case – saying Smith's appointment was unconstitutional.

“In spite of the Left and the weaponization efforts of Jim Comey, Alvin Bragg, Bonnie Willis and Jack Smith, we the people saw through it all, and we elected President Trump twice,” Jordan concluded.

Jayapal then asked Smith how he would describe “the toll on our democracy if we do not hold a president accountable for attempting to steal an election”.

Smith replied:

My belief is that if we do not hold the most powerful people in our society to the same standards of the rule of law, it can be catastrophic, because if they don't have to follow the law it's very easy to understand why people think they don't have to follow the law as well. So I think the law should be applied equally to everyone.

And asked about the toll for future elections and presidents who try to steal an election, Smith said:

I believe that if we don't hold people to account when they commit crimes in this context, it can endanger our election process, it can endanger election workers, and ultimately, our democracy.

The attack on this Capitol on January 6 was … an attack on the structure of our democracy.

Responding to questions from Democratic representative Pramila Jayapal, of Seattle, about what his investigation found, Jack Smith gave the following answers:

Did your investigation find that Donald Trump attempted to manufacture fraudulent slates of presidential electors in seven states that he lost? Yes.

Did he pressure state officials to ignore true vote counts in those states? Yes.

Did he spread lies and conspiracy to his followers to make them believe that the election had been illegally rigged against him? Yes.

Did he pressure DOJ officials to stop the certification of the election? He did.

Did he pressure his own vice-president, Mike Pence, to stop the certification, against the oath of office he had sworn to the constitution? He did.

And when all of this didn't work, did he – Donald Trump – motivate and inspire an angry mob tot he US Capitol to stop the certification. Our proof showed that he caused what happened on January 6, that it was foreseeable and that he exploited that violence.

Did Donald Trump know that his allegations of election fraud were lies when he spread them? Our proof was that he did and we intended to prove that at trial.

He even privately admitted that he lost the election, correct? Yes.

As Jack Smith continues to testify, Donald Trump has taken to Truth Social claiming that he “is being DECIMATED before Congress”.

The US president repeated his attack on Smith as a “deranged animal” and said he hoped that attorney general Pam Bondi “is looking at what he's done, including some of the crooked and corrupt witnesses that he was attempting to use in his case against me”.

“The whole thing was a Democrat SCAM — A big price should be paid by them for what they have put our Country through!” Trump went on.

A reminder that Trump has frequently called on Bondi and the DOJ to investigate individuals he perceives to be his political adversaries, and the department has brought cases against several of them.

Two people were arrested on Thursday morning in connection with a controversial protest at a Minnesota church on Sunday, Pam Bondi posted on social media.

The two people, who the attorney general identified as Nekima Levy Armstrong and Chauntyll Louisa Allen, were taken into custody on Thursday. Charging papers were not immediately available and the justice department did not immediately return a request for comment.

“Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,” Bondi said in a post on X.

The White House and Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, celebrated Armstrong's arrest on social media and posted a picture of her being detained. Armstrong was being charged under a statute that makes it a crime to conspire to block someone from exercising their civil rights.

The disruption at Cities church in St Paul took place after demonstrators alleged that one of the pastors, David Easterwood, was the acting field director of the St Paul ICE office. The upset at a religious institution has caused widespread outrage among conservatives and the Trump administration has pledged to bring charges.

Jack Smith said earlier that he opted not to charge Trump with insurrection, but he is asserting clearly that the January 6 Capitol riot was principally the fault of the president.
 “Our assessment of the evidence is that he is the person most responsible for what happened on January 6,” Smith said. “He caused what happened. It was foreseeable to him, and then when it happened, he tried to exploit it in furtherance of the conspiracy.”

Republicans on the judiciary committee have been very focused on Jack Smith's toll records of phone calls between Trump, the White House and members of Congress who supported the president's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
 As we noted earlier, toll records don't contain the content of the conversations, but Republicans are framing Smith's move to obtain the records – and get a gag order to prevent targeted lawmakers from being notified – as spying.
 Smith has rebutted that several times, including in previous closed door testimony where he said that he was examining lawmakers because Trump was trying to enlist them in efforts to disrupt the 6 January 2021 certification. 
 Still, Smith has not directly addressed the technical point that obtaining toll records of members of Congress risked violating the speech or debate clause in the constitution, namely that obtaining a gag order meant there was no way for lawmakers to challenge him in court.

A quick note that throughout this hearing, ranking member Jamie Raskin has chided House Republicans on the committee for not letting Jack Smith answer their questions.

Representative Brandon Gill snapped back, insisting that this was not Raskin's time, after the top Democrat told him that he was not giving Smith a chance to reply.

Congressman Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, finished his heated questioning of Jack Smith saying that “I yield back in disgust of this witness”.

The representative blasted Smith for going after “political enemies”.

“Maybe they're not your political enemies,” Issa said. “But they sure as hell were Joe Biden's political enemies, weren't they? They were Harris's political enemies. They were the enemies of the president.”

While answering questions from lawmakers earlier, Jack Smith defended gathering “toll data” from lawmakers' personal mobile phones as part of his fake-elector investigation, known as “Arctic Frost”.

A reminder that as part of the probe, the FBI subpoenaed phone records of several Republican members of Congress. Notably this did not include the content of any correspondence, but the metadata of the calls.

“We wanted to conduct a thorough investigation of the matters that was assigned to me, including attempts to interfere with the lawful transfer of power,” Smith said. “It was relevant to get toll records to understand the scope of that conspiracy, who they were seeking to coerce, who they were seeking to influence, who was seeking to help them.”

The former special counsel also said that it is “common practice” to obtain non-content toll records in complex investigation.

While speaking in Toledo, Ohio, vice-president JD Vance slammed the ongoing demonstrations against federal immigration agents in Minneapolis (where he's due to visit later today).

“If you want to turn down the chaos in Minneapolis, stop fighting immigration enforcement and accept that we have to have a border in this country. It's not that hard,” he said during his Thursday remarks at a shipping facility.

He went on to say that people should show their disapproval at the ballot box, not by going “to the street and assaulting federal law enforcement.”

“It's cowardly bullshit,” he added.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukraine president accuses EU leaders of waiting for direction from Donald Trump in blistering speech at Davos

Davos live – latest updates

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has taken aim at Europe in a speech at Davos, accusing leaders of being in “Greenland mode” as they waited for leadership from Donald Trump on Ukraine and other geopolitical crises rather than taking action themselves.

“Just last year, here in Davos, I ended my speech with the words Europe needs to know how to defend itself,” Zelenskyy said in a speech at the World Economic Forum. “A year has passed, and nothing has changed.”

He added: “Europe remains in Greenland mode: maybe someone somewhere will do something.”

Zelenskyy's speech nodded toward the extraordinary demands by Trump for the US to take over Greenland, but largely eschewed criticism of the US president, instead blaming Europeans for remaining at the behest of an increasingly unpredictable White House.

He said: “Everyone gave attention to Greenland, and it is clear most leaders are not sure what to do about it. It seems like everyone is just waiting for America to cool down on this topic, hoping it will pass away. But what if it [does] not: what then?

“Europe must learn how to defend itself,” he added. “Sending 14 or 40 soldiers to Greenland – what is that meant to achieve? What message does that send to Putin? To China? And perhaps, most importantly, what message does it send to Denmark?”

During the speech, Zelenskyy also suggested that Ukraine could help defend Europe in the event of a Russian invasion of Greenland, saying: “We know what to do if Russian warships go near Greenland, Ukraine can help with that. They can sink near Greenland just as they do near Crimea.”

He also suggested that Europe should play a more muscular role in targeting Russia's “shadow fleet” of oil tankers that help bankroll its war machine, and said it remained too easy for Russia to bypass sanctions that allow it to continue mass-producing missiles and other ordinance.

The threats to Europe were existential for Nato, he said, and Europe needed a “united armed forces” that could defend the continent.

“Today, Europe relies only on the belief that if danger comes, then Nato will react. But no one has really seen the alliance in action. If Putin decides to take Lithuania or strike Poland, who will respond? Right now, Nato exists thanks to the belief that the United States will act … but what if it doesn't?”

Zelenskyy's speech – which mainly targeted Europe for failing to respond to the instability in US leadership – was delivered shortly after he met Trump to discuss stalled talks for a peace deal to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

Trump told reporters that his meeting with Zelenskyy was “good” but that there was “a ways to go”. His envoy Steve Witkoff is to meet Vladimir Putin later on Thursday. Witkoff said the fact that the meeting was called by the Russians was a good sign.

“I think we've got it down to one issue and we have discussed iterations of that issue, and that means it's solvable,” Witkoff said before flying to Moscow. He was joined by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Asked at Davos whether he had a message for Putin, Trump said: “The war has to end.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

JAPAN

Nuclear restart halted

The restart of the world's largest nuclear power plant was suspended in Japan yesterday, just hours after the process began, its operator said, adding that the reactor remained “stable.” Operations to relaunch a reactor at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata Prefecture, closed since the 2011 Fukushima Dai-ichi disaster, began late on Wednesday after it received the final green light from the nuclear regulator. “An alarm from the monitoring system ... sounded during the reactor startup procedures and operations are currently suspended,” said Takashi Kobayashi, a spokesman for operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO). The reactor “is stable and there is no radioactive impact outside,” Kobayashi said, adding that TEPCO was investigating the cause of the incident and was unable to say when operations would resume. The restart, initially scheduled for Tuesday, had been pushed back after a technical issue related to a reactor alarm was detected last weekend — a problem that was resolved on Sunday, TEPCO said.

Russian activity feared

Russia would “likely persist in its ambitions to damage the undersea infrastructure of the Baltic Sea,” the Defence Command said in its annual military intelligence review published yesterday. The Baltic Sea region has been on high alert after a string of power cable, telecom link and gas pipeline outages since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Chief of Intelligence Major General Pekka Turunen said in an interview it was clear that Russia had the ability to destroy underwater infrastructure if it wanted, but added that no “smoking gun” had been found to prove Russia or another state actor was behind the incidents. “It is unusual that this [so many incidents] occurs,” Turunen said, adding their number had increased significantly since 2023. “The change is real,” he said. Russia has denied any involvement in the incidents. The number of suspicious security-related incidents have also increased around military personnel and exercises on land in the nation, the Defence Command said in the review. “The phenomenon is most likely related to increased vigilance and a lower threshold of reporting, but there is also genuine intelligence-gathering relating to military national defense in these numbers,” it said.

UNITED STATES

Haiti's council warned

Washington on Wednesday warned the transitional council in charge of Haiti against making changes to the troubled country's government, as pressure mounts for the unelected body to move toward elections for the first time in a decade. The US embassy in Haiti wrote on X that “the United States would consider that any person who supports such a destabilizing initiative, which favors the gangs, would be acting against the interests of the United States, the region, and the Haitian people, and will take appropriate measures accordingly.” The embassy added that such a maneuver would undermine efforts to establish “a minimal level of security and stability” in Haiti, where gang violence is surging and poverty deepening. The statement came as some members of the council are at odds with Haitian Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime, although it was not immediately clear why. The council met behind closed doors earlier on Wednesday. A spokesman for the prime minister's office said that he could not comment on the situation. The council's seven members with voting powers did not return messages for comment.

The astronauts evacuated last week from the International Space Station on Wednesday said that a portable ultrasound machine came in “super handy” during a medical crisis.

During their first public appearance since returning to Earth, the four astronauts refused to say which one of them needed medical attention and for what reason.

It was NASA's first medical evacuation in 65 years of spaceflight.

NASA astronaut Mike Fincke said that the crew used the onboard ultrasound machine once the medical problem arose on Jan. 7, the day before a planned spacewalk that was abruptly canceled.

The astronauts had already used the device a lot for routine checks of their body changes while living in weightlessness, “so when we had this emergency, the ultrasound machine came in super handy,” Fincke said.

It was so useful that Fincke said there should be one on all future spaceflights.

“It really helped,” he said.

“Of course, we didn't have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth,” he added. “We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises, but sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready ... preparation was super important.”

The space station is set up as well as it can be for medical emergencies, said NASA's Zena Cardman, who commanded the crew's early return flight with SpaceX.

She said NASA “made all the right decisions” in canceling the spacewalk, which would have been her first, and prioritizing the crew's well-being.

Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui said he was surprised how well all the preflight training paid off in dealing with the health concerns.

“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” Yui said. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”

Joining them on what turned out to be a five-and-a-half-month mission — more than a month shorter than planned — was Russia's Oleg Platonov. They launched in August last year from Florida and splashed down in the Pacific off San Diego last week.

Welcoming them back to Houston were their replacements, who are not due to launch until the middle of next month.

NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the flight.

“We were hoping to give them hugs in space, but we gave them hugs on Earth,” Fincke said.

Police in south-central Chile have arrested a man on suspicion of starting one of the wildfires that killed 21 people and razed entire neighborhoods, the government said on Wednesday.

Chilean Minister of Public Security Luis Cordero said that the suspect used a liquid accelerant to start fires in a wheat field, with authorities seizing 5 liters of fuel from him.

He was arrested at dawn in the town of Perquenco in Araucania region, south of Biobio.

The fires began simultaneously on Saturday in Biobio and Nuble regions, about 500km south of the capital, Santiago.

Fanned by strong winds and high temperatures, the flames quickly ripped through the coastal towns of Penco, Lirquen and Punta de Parra, leaving a blackened landscape of smoldering ruins.

Chilean Minister of the Interior Alvaro Elizalde told a news conference on Wednesday that an estimated 20,000 people faced property damage from the fires, including about 800 homes that were destroyed.

Chilean President Gabriel Boric visited Biobio on Wednesday

“We're working with heavy machinery to clear streets and remove debris, and we continue fighting the fire,” Boric said.

“We're still in a state of emergency,” he added.

Other fires were later reported further inland, in the Biobio town of Florida, about 40km east of the city of Concepcion, and in Araucania.

Cordero said substances used to start fires, including plastic containers containing accelerant, were found in Concepcion.

Firefighters were still battling 35 blazes on Wednesday — 22 in Biobio, five in Nuble and eight in Araucania, national forestry officials said.

A drop in temperature has helped ease the situation.

“We managed to reduce the intensity of the fire,” Carlos Zulieta, a firefighter in Florida told reporters, adding that it was now advancing “more slowly.”

Aid began trickling into affected areas on Wednesday.

Municipal workers and private companies were delivering portable toilets and generators to Lirquen, where some families were camped out in the ruins of their homes.



                                                                                Yemen's separatist leader has vowed to keep working for an independent state in the country's south, in his first social media post since he disappeared earlier this month after his group briefly seized swathes of territory.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

An oil terminal near the village of Volna in Russia's Krasnodar Krai was struck, sparking a blaze, killing three people and injuring eight others, Governor Veniamin Kondratyev and independent media reported late on Jan. 21.

""There is currently a fire at the terminals, with four oil product tanks on fire. To deal with the consequences, 97 people and 29 pieces of equipment, including employees of the Russian Emergencies Ministry, have been mobilized,"" Kondratyev claimed.

Volna is located just east of Crimea's Kerch Peninsula and about 325 kilometers (200 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory near Nikopol.

This is the second night in a row Krasnodar Krai has been under attack, Kondratyev said.

In the early hours of Jan. 21, 11 people were injured, and one was killed in an overnight attack in Russia's Republic of Adygea, while a separate drone strike sparked a fire at an oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai.

Drones struck Krasnodar Krai's Afipsky oil refinery, sparking a fire at the facility, Russian media and local authorities reported.

The refinery is one of the largest in southern Russia. It has been repeatedly targeted in previous drone attacks, including strikes reported last September and November that caused fires at the facility.

Ukraine considers Moscow's energy sites as military targets as they directly fund Russia's war against Ukraine. Kyiv regularly strikes deep within Russia in an effort to diminish the Kremlin's fighting power.

Editor's note: The story was updated with additional details.

U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled his new Board of Peace during a signing ceremony in Davos on Jan. 22, in an event attended by leaders and officials from 19 signatory states.

The new body is launched primarily to oversee the ceasefire in Gaza, but U.S. officials said it would be expanded to other conflict regions.

A White House official confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that the Board could play a role in other situations, subject to the chairman's discretion and the consent of the relevant states, without ruling out engagement on Russia's war in Ukraine.

""This is not just a 'Board of Peace,' this is a board of action,"" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said after signing.

""It is going to be a successful effort, and you see it reflected here today among countries of different backgrounds from different parts of the world.""

Countries represented at the opening ceremony included Turkey, Hungary, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Argentina, Pakistan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. 

Others, including Belarus, Israel, and Vietnam, have also said they would join the Board, while France, Norway, and Sweden have rejected.

Russia has been invited and said it was considering the option, while Trump claimed that Moscow had already accepted. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine had also received an invitation, but stressed that any such effort could only take place after the war ends.

""With Russians, we are enemies. Belarus — (they are) allies of the Russians. We can't be with them. I think so it will work with a monitor mission only after the war ends for us,"" he said.

While critics fear that the Board could become a competitor to the U.N., Trump claimed it would work in conjunction with the international organization. The U.S. president is chairing the body, which requires a $1 billion fee to secure a permanent seat.

Addressing an audience during the ceremony in Switzerland, Trump hailed the coming ""peace in the Middle East"" and repeated his claim that he had settled eight conflicts, promising that ""another one's coming pretty soon"" in reference to Ukraine.

Trump, who is meeting Zelensky later in the day, acknowledged that the Russia-Ukraine war has been the most difficult to settle so far.

The ceremony took place the same day as Trump's envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are scheduled to travel to Moscow to present Russian President Vladimir Putin with a 20-point peace framework for Ukraine.

Witkoff has been optimistic about the progress in negotiations, noting that the talks are ""down to one issue.""

Zelensky previously said the peace deal is ""90% ready,"" even as some of the most thorny issues — including Moscow's demand that Ukraine cede the entire Donbas region — remain unresolved.

Ukrainian drone strikes inflicted damage on Russian oil and weapons facilities in widespread attacks carried out overnight on Jan. 22, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces confirmed.

Targets included Russia's Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, several radar stations in Russian-occupied Crimea, a drone storage facility in the occupied part of Kherson Oblast, command and observation post of Russian military personnel in Donetsk Oblast.

Tamanneftegaz, located in the village of Volna, Krasnodar Krai, operates the Taman transshipment complex, handling crude oil, petroleum products, and liquefied hydrocarbon gases. The complex is one of the largest in the Black Sea region.

According to Ukraine's General Staff, there was a direct hit on the terminal, resulting in explosions and a fire. The extent of the damage is being assessed, it added.

A source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent that it was drones operated by the SBU's Alpha special operations unit that struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal. The strike damaged technological pipelines at the terminal's berths and multiple oil storage tanks, according to the SBU source. Damage to shutoff valves caused petroleum products to leak and then ignite, the source said, adding that the fire covered about 7,000 square meters.

The source estimated preliminary losses at about $50 million and said the terminal's tank farm for storing petroleum products and liquefied gas exceeds 1 million cubic meters. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the SBU's claims.

Krasnodar Krai Governor Veniamin Kondratiev wrote on Telegram on the evening of Jan. 21 that as a result of the attack, four tanks containing petroleum products caught fire. He claimed that two enterprise employees died, and several others were injured in the attack.

Previously the terminal was attacked on Dec. 22, 2025, Ukraine's General Staff said. A source in Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent at the time that the Ukrainian strike damaged equipment at the oil terminal, the liquefied hydrocarbon gas pier, and other port infrastructure, triggering a large-scale fire.

Ukraine reported additional strikes on military targets in Russian-occupied regions, including Crimea, Kherson and Donetsk oblasts.

In Crimea, the Ukrainian military struck radar stations 59N6-E ""Protivnik-GE"", 55Zh6 Nebo-U, 55Zh6M Nebo-M, the General Staff said, adding that the extent of the damage is being assessed.

In the occupied part of Kherson Oblast, a drone storage facility in Novohryhorivka was also hit, the General Staff said.

In the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast, the command and observation post of Russia's 76th Airborne Brigade and the military personnel of the 74th Motorized Brigade in Selydove, the ammunition depot of Russia's 101st separate logistics brigade in Debaltseve were hit, the General Staff said.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the military's claims.

Ukraine has escalated its strike campaign against oil facilities and military objects inside Russia and Russian-occupied territories throughout 2025 and into 2026, primarily relying on domestically developed drones

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday after talks with U.S. President Donald Trump in Davos that the terms of security guarantees for Ukraine had been finalized, but that the vital issue of territory in its war with Russia remains unsolved.

In what he said was a positive sign of progress in long-running peace talks to end the four-year conflict, Zelensky said negotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. would hold trilateral meetings for the first time in Abu Dhabi on Friday and Saturday.

He also said a deal was almost ready on economic recovery after the war with Russia, a key element of Kyiv-backed proposals to push back on an earlier U.S. peace plan seen as heavily favouring Moscow.

Zelensky opened his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos with a reference to the U.S. film 'Groundhog Day,' saying Europe and the wider world were trapped in a cycle of repeating the same debates while threats continue to evolve.

Reuters

Zelensky and Trump – who have met half a dozen times since Trump returned to the White House last year and upended U.S. policy on Ukraine – both said Thursday's talks were positive.

“I think the meeting with President Zelensky was good. It's an ongoing process,” Trump told reporters, saying that U.S. envoys were heading for talks in Moscow on Thursday. Asked what his message was for Putin, Trump replied: “The war has to end.”

Zelensky, who did not indicate he discussed territory with Trump on Thursday, had said earlier this week he would only travel to Davos if he could sign agreements with Trump on U.S. security guarantees and postwar reconstruction funding for Ukraine.

Trump said his meeting with Zelensky in Davos was 'good,' and repeated his call for the war in Ukraine to end.

The Associated Press

Zelensky has been saddled with an energy crisis at home from Russian air strikes that have left millions of Ukrainians across swathes of the capital and other regions without power and heating.

Zelensky described Russia's months-long onslaught as an attempt by Putin to freeze Ukrainians to death. Invoking Trump's operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro to face charges before a U.S. court, he wondered aloud why Putin was not yet on trial.

U.S. envoy for Ukraine Steve Witkoff had told an audience at the World Economic Forum earlier on Thursday that good progress was being made in peace talks, after he met with Ukrainian and Russian officials in Davos.

“If both sides want to solve this, we're going to get it solved,” Witkoff said.

Witkoff was due in Moscow later on Thursday with fellow U.S. envoy Jared Kushner – Trump's son-in-law – for talks with Putin on the possible plan to end Europe's deadliest war since World War Two.

After those discussions, negotiators would head directly to Abu Dhabi, Witkoff said on Thursday, “where there will be military-to-military talks and discussion of the prosperity package.”

Russia has been cool on the U.S.-led peace push, demanding that Kyiv give up part of its eastern Donetsk region which Moscow has been unable to conquer despite grinding forward on the battlefield.

Moscow agrees with Trump that Ukraine is holding up peace deal, Kremlin says

Putin said late on Wednesday that they would discuss a settlement on Ukraine and the possibility of using frozen Russian assets for reconstruction of Moscow-occupied land, as well as Trump's proposal for a Board of Peace, tasked with promoting peace around the world.

Critics of the proposal have said it would rival or undermine the United Nations.

The Kremlin said Putin's meeting with Witkoff and Kushner will take place after 7 p.m. Moscow time.

Ukraine's international bonds rallied more than 2 cents on Thursday as the bout of high-level diplomatic meetings lifted hopes in financial markets that progress could be made toward ending the war.

Russian air strikes hit several parts of Ukraine on Thursday. In the southern region of Odesa, a 17-year-old man was killed when a drone struck an apartment building, the regional governor said.

Eleven people were also wounded in the central city of Kryvyi Rih when a ballistic missile slammed into a residential building, officials said.

In the capital Kyiv, nearly 3,000 highrises across the city remained without heating on Thursday after Russia's latest attack earlier this week.

Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of defrauding Theranos' investors and is not eligible for release until December, 2031.Jeff Chiu/The Associated Press

Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of now-defunct blood testing startup Theranos, has asked U.S. President Donald Trump to release her from prison with nearly six years left before she is eligible for release.

Holmes sought to commute her 11-1/4-year sentence last year and her request remains pending, according to the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney.

Now 41, Holmes was convicted in 2022 on four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy for cheating investors, and ordered to pay US$452-million in restitution. A federal appeals court upheld her conviction and sentence last February.

Prosecutors said Holmes lied to investors from 2010 to 2015 by promising Theranos' technology could run many medical tests on one blood drop from a finger prick.

Theranos was once valued at U$9-billion, and Forbes magazine estimated Holmes' net worth at US$4.5-billion in 2015.

Holmes would still owe restitution if Trump released her from prison, but would not owe it if he pardoned her.

She is housed at a minimum security federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas, and eligible for release in December, 2031.

The White House declined to comment on Holmes' request. Lawyers for Holmes did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Former Uvalde school district police officer Adrian Gonzales leaves the courtroom as the jury goes back to deliberate during his trial at the Nueces County Courthouse on Wednesday.Sam Owens/The Associated Press

A former Uvalde police officer was acquitted Wednesday of charges that he failed in his duties to confront the gunman at Robb Elementary during the critical first minutes of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.

Jurors deliberated for more than seven hours before finding Adrian Gonzales, 52, not guilty in the first trial over the hesitant law enforcement response to the 2022 attack, which killed 19 children and two teachers.

Gonzales appeared to close his eyes and take a deep breath as he stood to hear the verdict in a Corpus Christi courtroom hundreds of miles from Uvalde, where Gonzales' attorneys argued that he could not receive a fair trial. After the verdict was read, he hugged one of his lawyers and appeared to be fighting back tears.

“Thank you for the jury for considering all the evidence,” Gonzales told reporters. Asked if he wanted to say anything to the families, he declined.

Moments after the verdict was read, several members of families of the victims sat in silence, some crying or wiping away tears.

“Faith is fractured, but you never lose faith,” said Jesse Rizo, whose 9-year-old niece Jackie Cazares was killed. He said he was frustrated by the verdict and hopes the state will press ahead with the trial of former Uvalde schools Police Chief Pete Arredondo, the only other officer who has been charged over the police response.

“Those children in the cemetery can't speak for themselves,” Rizo said.

Arredondo's trial has not yet been set.

Jurors declined to speak to reporters while leaving the courthouse.

The nearly three-week trial was a rare case in the U.S. of an officer facing criminal charges on accusations of failing to stop a crime and protect lives. Gonzales had faced the possibility of up to two years in prison if convicted.

The proceedings included emotional testimony from teachers who were shot and survived. Prosecutors argued that Gonzales abandoned his training and did nothing to stop or interrupt the teenage gunman before he entered the school.

“We're expected to act differently when talking about a child that can't defend themselves,” special prosecutor Bill Turner said during closing arguments Wednesday. “If you have a duty to act, you can't stand by while a child is in imminent danger.”

At least 370 law enforcement officers rushed to the school, where 77 minutes passed before a tactical team finally entered the classroom to confront and kill the gunman. Gonzales was one of just two officers indicted, angering some victim's relatives who said they wanted more to be held accountable.

Gonzales was charged with 29 counts of child abandonment and endangerment — each count representing the 19 students who were killed and 10 others who were injured.

During the trial jurors heard a medical examiner describe the fatal wounds to the children, some of whom were shot more than a dozen times. Several parents told of sending their children to school for an awards ceremony and the panic that ensued as the attack unfolded.

Gonzales' lawyers said he arrived upon a chaotic scene of rifle shots echoing on school grounds and never saw the gunman before the attacker went inside the school. They also insisted that three other officers who arrived seconds later had a better chance to stop the gunman.

Gonzales' attorney, Jason Goss, told jurors before they began deliberating that his client was not responsible for the attack.

“The monster that hurt those kids is dead,” Goss said. “It is one of the worst things that ever happened.”

A conviction would tell police they have to be “perfect” when responding to a crisis and could make them even more hesitant in the future, Goss said.

Some victims' families made the long drive to watch Gonzales' trial. Early on the sister of one of the teachers killed was removed from the courtroom after an angry outburst following one officer's testimony.

Gonzales' trial was tightly focused on his actions in the early moments of the attack, but prosecutors also presented the graphic and emotional testimony as the result of police failures.

State and federal reviews of the shooting cited cascading problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and technology, and questioned why officers waited so long.

Prosecutors faced a high bar to win a conviction. Juries are often reluctant to convict law enforcement officers for inaction, as seen after the 2018 school massacre in Parkland, Florida. A sheriff's deputy was acquitted after being charged with failing to confront the shooter in that attack — the first such prosecution in the U.S. for an on-campus shooting.

Jens-Frederik Nielsen said sovereignty was a ""red line"" that needed to be respected as he said Greenland was ready to negotiate after Trump backtracked on suggesting force could be used to acquire it. Follow DW.

Follow below for DW's coverage of developments concerning Greenland on Thursday, January 21. You can catch up on the news from Wednesday on the issue here.

Denmark has requested that the NATO military alliance be more present in the Arctic, Danish Prime ⁠Minister ‍Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday ahead of an EU summit meeting in Brussels. 

""We ⁠need a permanent presence from NATO in the ‍Arctic region, including around Greenland,"" ​Frederiksen ​told reporters. ""It's clear for everybody that we are a sovereign state ‍and we cannot negotiate about that. But, of ​course, we can discuss with the US how we ⁠can ​strengthen our common cooperation on security in ‌the ‌Arctic region."" 
 

Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen has said he's not privý with the ""details"" of any potential deal on Greenland being discussed by Donald Trump and NATO and European powers in Davos or elsewhere.

He said the Danish autonomous territory wanted a ""peaceful dialogue"" with the United States and that it was ""ready to negotiate a better partnership"" with the US, including on issues like minerals access, but also said that violation of its sovereignty or right to self-determination was a red line. 

""We have some red lines... We have to respect our territorial integrity. We have to respect international law, sovereignty,"" he told a press conference. 

He said he was ""glad"" about Trump's claim on Wednesday that he was not entertaining the use of force to control Greenland and later that a ""deal"" had been struck. 

The US president and others have been coy on the details of this deal, though he said at a Fox News event in Davos ""essentially it's total access. There's no end, there's no time limit."" 

""We will have everything we want. We're getting everything we want at no cost,"" Trump said. 

How this might differ from the existing, longstanding, and wide-reaching US rights to military access and construction in Greenland — a footprint it has drastically downsized of its own volition in recent decades — is entirely unclear. 

Greenland is becoming a geopolitical hot spot: NATO is showing its presence, the US is asserting itself while Denmark organizes aid. Amid the global power struggle, the Inuit fear their identity may be lost.

After his one-on-one meeting with US President Donald Trump in Davos on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spared no criticism of his fellow European leaders in a World Economic Forum speech, chiding them for timidity in the face of fundamental threats to democracy.

Zelenskyy tore into the bloc over what he called its slow and overly cautious approach to confronting the very real threat on its doorstep as war rages into its fourth year on the continent and European leaders appear to be in disarray over how to deal with Trump's approach to alliances and geopolitics.

Among a number of core issues, Zelenskyy blasted the European response to Trump's threats of taking Greenland by force, asking, ""if you send 40 soldiers to Greenland, what message does it send? Those soldiers won't protect anything."" 

After warning that Europe needs a united fighting force and that NATO only exists as such due to the ""belief that the US will act,"" Zelenskyy said, ""when you refuse to help people fighting for democracy, consequences return.""

US President Donald Trump told US media that the details of his bid to gain full access to  Greenland were being worked out and said he was seeking ""total access"" to the Danish territory.

""It's really being negotiated now, ‌the details of it. But essentially, it's total access. ‌It's — there's ⁠no end, there's no time limit,"" Trump told the Fox Business Network from the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.

Trump acknowledged the impact of his quest for Greenland on global markets and said ⁠he did not plan to pay to acquire it.

""I noticed the stock market went up very substantially ‍after we announced it,"" Trump told Fox's ""Mornings with Maria"" program. He did not mention the dramatic market drops when he would not rule out using force to control the Arctic island that is a Danish territory. 

On Wednesday, Trump stepped back from a tariff threat on eight European countries and ruled out the use of force to ⁠seize Greenland.

European leaders will gather for an emergency EU summit to discuss transatlantic ties on Thursday.

The Brussels meeting was scheduled earlier this week when US President Donald Trump careened from one threat to another against allies over his desire to ""possess"" the semiautonomous Danish territory of Greenland. 

Though perhaps slightly less urgent than before Trump appeared to climb down from his maximalist position on the subject Wednesday evening during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the Brussels meeting will see EU leaders grapple with the fundamental nature of the bloc's decadesold partnership with Washington. 

Trump had previously threatened additional 10% tariffs on allies as well as the use of military force to take Greenland if NATO partners refused to acquiesce to his plan to snatch the island territory from NATO ally Denmark.

Though EU leaders were relieved by Trump's U-turn on the Greenland tariff threat, they are less than confident they can count on him to keep his word.

""Nothing ​much changed,"" said an EU diplomat quoted by Reuters news agency. ""We still need to see details of the Greenland deal. We are a bit fed up with all the bullying. And we need to act on a few things: more resiliency, unity, get our things together on internal market, competitiveness. And no more accepting tariff bullying.""

European Council President Antonio Costa, who will chair Thursday's summit, said the US under Trump has threatened EU security, principles and prosperity, noting, ""All these three dimensions are being tested.""

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told reporters in Switzerland that a new framework agreement put forth by the US would require members of the alliance to quickly ramp up Arctic security efforts.

""We will come together in NATO with our senior commanders to work out what is necessary,"" said Rutte. ""I have no doubt ‍we can do this quite fast,"" he added. ""Certainly I would hope for 2026, I ​hope ​even early in 2026.""

Rutte also attempted to allay fears that he himself had voiced over Greenland taking focus off of combatting the Russian invasion of Ukraine on NATO's eastern flank. The Dutch politician said the intensified Arctic defense effort would in no way rob Kyiv of NATO resources.  

Lastly, Rutte also noted that mineral exploitation on Greenland had not discussed during his Wednesday meeting with the US president in Davos. 

Negotiations on the issue would continue between the US, Denmark and Greenland said Rutte.

As sources familiar with talks between US President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte say Denmark and the US are set to renegotiate a 1951 Greenland defense agreement, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen says the issue of Arctic security concerns the whole of NATO.

In a statement released Thursday, Frederiksen voiced approval for discussions on the issue, adding that she remains in close contact with Rutte.

The prime minister said she is interested in continued dialogue on all aspects of Arctic security — including the so-called ""Golden Dome"" missile defense system — as long as this is ""done with respect for our territorial integrity."" 

Frederiksen's statement confirmed that Denmark is willing to negotiate on security, investment and economic issues, but she added, ""we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty"" while noting that only Denmark and Greenland can make decisions on the kingdom and territory. 

US President Trump says a ""framework deal"" for the future of Greenland is in place, and that he's dropping his tariff threats against Europe.

Danish consumers have found a new way to make their displeasure over US designs on Greenland heard. Technically it is an old way — a boycott — supported by new technology — namely cellphone apps. 

Increasingly, Danes have been downloading apps such as UdenUSA (Without USA) — which is currently the most downloaded app at Apple's Denmark App Store — and using them at the supermarket to avoid US-made goods.

UdenUSA's developers say the idea came last year after Trump's reelection and his return to the idea of the US taking semi-autonomous Greenland away from Denmark. 

With Facebook groups dedicated to the issue attracting hundreds of thousands of members, Jonas Pipper and Malthe Hensberg say consumers were having difficulty identifying US-made products so they decided to create an app that would help them do so as well as suggesting European-made alternatives.

Supermarkets themselves have also taken to identifying EU-made products for consumers. The situation is not unlike boycotts of US-made products in other countries, such as Canada, after Trump began harassing allies with high tariffs and/or open threats to their sovereignty.   

Though the Danish boycott will likely be insignificant in terms of dollar amounts — few US products make their way into Denmark's relatively small economy — the boycott gives citizens an opportunity to make their voices heard on the Greenland machinations of their US ally

In his speech at the World Economic Forum, US President Donald Trump again returned to his plans for Greenland, saying Denmark would not be able to secure the island.

NATO on Thursday said that Mark Rutte had given no ground on Greenland's sovereignty during meetings with US President Donald, Trump who has taken to loudly exclaiming that the US ""must have"" the semi-autonomous Danish territory.

""The secretary general did not suggest compromises on Greenland's sovereignty during his meeting with the president in Davos,"" said NATO spokeswoman Allison Hart.

Rutte himself said he had spoken with Trump about how the Arctic could be safeguarded, adding, ""We had a very good discussion on that.""

Rutte went on to say that further talks would be held in order to, ""make sure when it comes to Greenland particularly, that we ensure that the Chinese and the Russians will not gain access to the Greenland economy of military.""

Trump, who has spoken of the need to fully possess Greenland, said after his meeting with Rutte that he believes NATO allies can come to an agreement that satisfies US desires to create what has been billed a ""Golden Dome"" missile-defense system, as well as granting the US access to critical minerals on the island territory while at the same time keeping Moscow and Beijing away.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte answered ""Yes!"" on Thursday when asked in Davos if he believed US President Donald Trump is committed to the cause of Ukrainian independence and sovereignty, adding, ""I have never doubted this.""

With the world currently focusing so much attention on Trump's plans to snatch or buy Greenland — and what this might mean for the future of NATO and the EU — Rutte said there is a danger that the pressing issue of Ukraine's fate at the hands of Russian invaders gets pushed out of the picture as the war nears its fourth anniversary.

""What we need is to keep our eyes on the ball of Ukraine. Let's not drop that ball,"" said the NATO leader. 

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned that ""there is still a lot of work to be done"" among the parties involved in the row over the control of Greenland.

Rutte made the comments in an interview with US broadcaster Fox News on Wednesday.

The NATO boss said that he and US President Donald Trump agreed that the Arctic region must be jointly protected, during a meeting held on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. 

He added that the issue of whether Greenland would remain with Denmark did not come up in their talks.

""He (Trump) is very much focused on what do we need to do to make sure ⁠that that huge Arctic ​region — where change is taking place at the moment, where the Chinese and the Russians are ‌more and more ‌active — how we can protect it,"" Rutte said.

Trump earlier canceled his threats to impose tariffs on several European nations and use them as ‌leverage to take control of the mineral-rich island.

He also ruled out the use of military force to seize Greenland. ","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'dw.com'}","world"

Jens-Frederik Nielsen said sovereignty was a ""red line"" that needed to be respected as he said Greenland was ready to negotiate after Trump backtracked on suggesting force could be used to acquire it. Follow DW.

Follow below for DW's coverage of developments concerning Greenland on Thursday, January 21. You can catch up on the news from Wednesday on the issue here.

Denmark has requested that the NATO military alliance be more present in the Arctic, Danish Prime ⁠Minister ‍Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday ahead of an EU summit meeting in Brussels. 

""We ⁠need a permanent presence from NATO in the ‍Arctic region, including around Greenland,"" ​Frederiksen ​told reporters. ""It's clear for everybody that we are a sovereign state ‍and we cannot negotiate about that. But, of ​course, we can discuss with the US how we ⁠can ​strengthen our common cooperation on security in ‌the ‌Arctic region."" 
 

Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen has said he's not privý with the ""details"" of any potential deal on Greenland being discussed by Donald Trump and NATO and European powers in Davos or elsewhere.

He said the Danish autonomous territory wanted a ""peaceful dialogue"" with the United States and that it was ""ready to negotiate a better partnership"" with the US, including on issues like minerals access, but also said that violation of its sovereignty or right to self-determination was a red line. 

""We have some red lines... We have to respect our territorial integrity. We have to respect international law, sovereignty,"" he told a press conference. 

He said he was ""glad"" about Trump's claim on Wednesday that he was not entertaining the use of force to control Greenland and later that a ""deal"" had been struck. 

The US president and others have been coy on the details of this deal, though he said at a Fox News event in Davos ""essentially it's total access. There's no end, there's no time limit."" 

""We will have everything we want. We're getting everything we want at no cost,"" Trump said. 

How this might differ from the existing, longstanding, and wide-reaching US rights to military access and construction in Greenland — a footprint it has drastically downsized of its own volition in recent decades — is entirely unclear. 

Greenland is becoming a geopolitical hot spot: NATO is showing its presence, the US is asserting itself while Denmark organizes aid. Amid the global power struggle, the Inuit fear their identity may be lost.

After his one-on-one meeting with US President Donald Trump in Davos on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spared no criticism of his fellow European leaders in a World Economic Forum speech, chiding them for timidity in the face of fundamental threats to democracy.

Zelenskyy tore into the bloc over what he called its slow and overly cautious approach to confronting the very real threat on its doorstep as war rages into its fourth year on the continent and European leaders appear to be in disarray over how to deal with Trump's approach to alliances and geopolitics.

Among a number of core issues, Zelenskyy blasted the European response to Trump's threats of taking Greenland by force, asking, ""if you send 40 soldiers to Greenland, what message does it send? Those soldiers won't protect anything."" 

After warning that Europe needs a united fighting force and that NATO only exists as such due to the ""belief that the US will act,"" Zelenskyy said, ""when you refuse to help people fighting for democracy, consequences return.""

US President Donald Trump told US media that the details of his bid to gain full access to  Greenland were being worked out and said he was seeking ""total access"" to the Danish territory.

""It's really being negotiated now, ‌the details of it. But essentially, it's total access. ‌It's — there's ⁠no end, there's no time limit,"" Trump told the Fox Business Network from the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.

Trump acknowledged the impact of his quest for Greenland on global markets and said ⁠he did not plan to pay to acquire it.

""I noticed the stock market went up very substantially ‍after we announced it,"" Trump told Fox's ""Mornings with Maria"" program. He did not mention the dramatic market drops when he would not rule out using force to control the Arctic island that is a Danish territory. 

On Wednesday, Trump stepped back from a tariff threat on eight European countries and ruled out the use of force to ⁠seize Greenland.

European leaders will gather for an emergency EU summit to discuss transatlantic ties on Thursday.

The Brussels meeting was scheduled earlier this week when US President Donald Trump careened from one threat to another against allies over his desire to ""possess"" the semiautonomous Danish territory of Greenland. 

Though perhaps slightly less urgent than before Trump appeared to climb down from his maximalist position on the subject Wednesday evening during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the Brussels meeting will see EU leaders grapple with the fundamental nature of the bloc's decadesold partnership with Washington. 

Trump had previously threatened additional 10% tariffs on allies as well as the use of military force to take Greenland if NATO partners refused to acquiesce to his plan to snatch the island territory from NATO ally Denmark.

Though EU leaders were relieved by Trump's U-turn on the Greenland tariff threat, they are less than confident they can count on him to keep his word.

""Nothing ​much changed,"" said an EU diplomat quoted by Reuters news agency. ""We still need to see details of the Greenland deal. We are a bit fed up with all the bullying. And we need to act on a few things: more resiliency, unity, get our things together on internal market, competitiveness. And no more accepting tariff bullying.""

European Council President Antonio Costa, who will chair Thursday's summit, said the US under Trump has threatened EU security, principles and prosperity, noting, ""All these three dimensions are being tested.""

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told reporters in Switzerland that a new framework agreement put forth by the US would require members of the alliance to quickly ramp up Arctic security efforts.

""We will come together in NATO with our senior commanders to work out what is necessary,"" said Rutte. ""I have no doubt ‍we can do this quite fast,"" he added. ""Certainly I would hope for 2026, I ​hope ​even early in 2026.""

Rutte also attempted to allay fears that he himself had voiced over Greenland taking focus off of combatting the Russian invasion of Ukraine on NATO's eastern flank. The Dutch politician said the intensified Arctic defense effort would in no way rob Kyiv of NATO resources.

US President Donald Trump called off looming tariffs on European countries over Greenland after he said he reached a ""framework of a future deal"" over the island during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

We've moved to a new blog here. Thank you for reading!

Welcome to DW's coverage of developments concerning Greenland on Wednesday, January 21. Catch up with yesterday's news here.

President Donald Trump delivered remarks to government officials and business elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday.

He made headlines when he said he would not use military force to acquire Greenland but laid out an argument to have the US have control over the Danish territory, saying US ownership would ""strengthen"" the NATO alliance.

Europe later said it was going to suspend the approval of a trade deal reached with Trump last year in July.

Hours after that, Trump said he was scrapping tariffs he threatened to impose on eight European countries, including Denmark and Germany, over their support for Greenland's status to continue to be a part of the Danish Kingdom.

Trump said he was backing down after having a conversation with NATO Secretary- General Mark Rutte and that the pair had ""formed the framework of a future deal"" with respect to Greenland.

European leaders have reacted to the news of an emergent deal over the future of Greenland, but there's sure to be more on the EU-US trade deal later this morning.

Here are some more reactions from Europe:

""The day is ending better than it began,"" Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told Danish radio. 

""I'm taking two things away from Davos: that Trump says he won't attack Greenland … and that the tariff war is on standby. That's positive.""

He posted on X that leaders still needed to ""sit down and find out how we can address the American security concerns in the Arctic while respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark.""

Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said she ""welcomed"" the suspension of tariffs scheduled for February 1. 

But in a post on X, she stressed that it is ""essential to continue fostering dialogue between allied nations.""

But Germany's finance minister warned against premature optimism over the Greenland deal. 

""It's good that they [the US and NATO] are engaged in dialogue,"" Lars Klingbeil said in an interview with Germany's ZDF television. 

""But we have to wait a bit and not get our ‍hopes up too soon,"" Klingbeil said. 

It was important that Europe ""made it clear that these are the sovereign interests of Greenland and also Denmark,"" Klingbeil said. ""There is state integrity and sovereignty, and that will not be shifted."" 

US President Donald Trump said the broad outlines of the Greenland agreement were in place, without providing further details, but when asked about whether the US would own the island, Trump said the matter was somewhat complex.

""It'll be forever for Greenland at this point, forever,"" Trump said about the agreement.

He said the agreement would address security issues, as he has argued that the US must own Greenland for national security reasons amid concerns about threats from China and Russia.

Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof welcomed Donald Trump's move to cancel threatened tariffs against European allies as a sign of ""de-escalation.""

""It is positive that we are now on the path to de-escalation and that the 10-percent import tariffs are off the table,"" Schoof wrote on X.

""Now it is important that the US, Canada and Europe continue to work together within NATO to strengthen security in the Arctic region and counter threats from Russia and China,"" he added. 

NATO spokeswoman Allison Hart said the alliance's secretary general, Mark Rutte, had held ""very productive"" talks with Donald Trump on security in the Arctic region.

""Discussions among NATO Allies on the framework the president referenced will focus on ensuring Arctic security through the collective efforts of Allies, especially the seven Arctic Allies,"" Hart said. 

""Negotiations between Denmark, Greenland, and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold — economically or militarily — in Greenland,"" she added.

Denmark's Foreign Minister ⁠Lars ‍Lokke Rasmussen ⁠welcomed US President ‍Donald Trump's ​announcement ​that the US no longer plans ‍to impose tariffs ​on European nations.

Ramussen said the day ended better than it started, seeing it as a positive sign that Trump has ended the brief trade war over Greenland.

Denmark's top diplomat said it was a good signal that Trump won't use force, but warned that the US president has ""an ambition we can't accomodate.""

In statements made after the post on his Truth Social network, Trump said the agreement on Greenland ""gets everything we wanted,"" that it is a deal ""everyone is happy with,"" and that he hopes the deal will ""last forever.""

""It's a deal that people jumped at, really fantastic for the USA, gets everything we wanted, including especially real national security and international security,"" he said.

He added that additional details on the framework agreement would be announced later.

""Its a little bit ‍complex,"" Trump said, adding ​it will be explained ""down the line.""

President Donald Trump said he is dropping his tariff threat on several European nations after agreeing with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on a ""framework of a future deal"" involving Greenland and the wider Arctic region.

The step-down comes days after Trump threatened to impose a 10% import tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland until ""a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland.""

On Wednesday, he wrote on Truth Social: ""I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February.""

The move could ease tensions with NATO partners, though questions remain about what the Arctic deal actually includes.

Europe has been steadfast in saying Greenland is not for sale and cannot be wrested from Denmark.

Speaking at WEF earlier, Trump also ruled out using force to acquire the island from Denmark, calling instead for immediate negotiations.

Trump argues Greenland is vital for US and NATO security against Russia and China.

US President Donald Trump said he and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte ""have formed the framework of a future deal"" concerning Greenland.

The two met during the World Economic Forum.

Trump added that he would not impose tariffs on key European allies, including Germany, despite their opposition to his plan for the US to take control of Greenland.

""This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations,"" he wrote on his Truth Social.

Greenland's government issued new emergency preparedness guidelines for the general public on Wednesday as the vast, sparsely inhabited island suddenly monopolizes global attention.

Peter Borg, minister for fisheries, hunting, agriculture and self-sufficiency, said in a press conference in Nuuk that the document was only meant as ""an insurance policy.""

""We don't expect to have to use it,"" Borg said. 

According to Greenland residents online, the brochure provides advice about household preparedness in the difficult terrain and climate.

As examples, it advises citizens to ensure they have ample quantities of water, non-perishable foods, and an alternative heat source for cooking without electricity, essential medication, a first-aid kit and several days' worth of hygiene supplies. 

The European Parliament has suspended its work on the EU's trade deal with the US brokered with the Trump administration last summer in protest at the demands to acquire Greenland and the accompanying threats of fresh tariffs.

The EU assembly has been debating various components of the agreement struck in Turnberry, Scotland, and its trade committee had been scheduled to vote on them next week. 

However, the committee's chairman, Bernd Lange, said on Wednesday that the process and the votes had been postponed. 

""Given the continued and escalating threats, including tariff threats, against Greenland and Denmark, and their European allies, we have been left with no alternative but to suspend work on the two Turnberry legislative proposals until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation, and before any further steps are taken,"" Lange said. 

Lange said that by threatening the territorial integrity and sovereignty of EU member Denmark, and using tariffs as a coercive instrument, ""the US is undermining the stability and predictability of EU-US trade relations.""

Despite various reservations about the deal being lopsided, with the EU required to cut most import duties while the US sticks to a broad rate of 15%, lawmakers had previously indicated a willingness to accept the agreement with caveats.

EU trade deals need approval from the European Parliament, often one of the hardest and most divided chambers for it to clear, as well as from individual member states.

The complexity of this was also on show on Wednesday as the European Parliament voted for a legal check of the recently-signed deal with four Mercosur countries in Latin America. 

US President Donald Trump claims he ""won't use force"" to take over Greenland and called for ""immediate negotiations"" to discuss the ""acquisition"" of the Arctic territory by the United States.

""This enormous unsecured island is actually part of North America,"" Trump said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, referring to the Danish territory's geographical location off the northeastern coast of Canada.

""That's our territory,"" he continued.

""The fact is, no nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States,"" Trump said. ""We're a great power, much greater than people even understand. I think they found that out two weeks ago in Venezuela.""

The US president also responded to a speech by Mark Carney on Tuesday in which the Canadian Prime Minister called for ""middle powers"" to ""act together"" amid geopolitical developments he described as a ""rupture.""

Trump claimed that Canada gets many ""freebies"" from the US and ""should be grateful.""

""Canada lives because of the United States,"" Trump said. ""Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.""

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer insisted on Wednesday that the United Kingdom would not give in to pressure from US President Donald Trump over the future of the autonomous Danish territory Greenland.

""I will not yield, Britain will not yield on our principles and values about the future of Greenland under threats of tariffs,"" he told lawmakers in Parliament, adding he would host Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in London on Thursday.

Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Britain and other European countries for opposing his claims on Greenland.

""The future of Greenland is a binary issue that is splitting the world at the moment, with material consequences,"" Starmer said. ""I've been clear and consistent in my position on the future of Greenland: the future is for Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone.""

Danish veterans who served alongside US forces in Afghanistan and Iraq say they feel ""betrayed"" by Washington's threats to seize Greenland — the Arctic territory which belongs to Denmark.

Following the September 11, 2021, attacks, Denmark contributed up to 750 troops to the US-led invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. Out of that number, 44 were killed — the highest per capita death toll among coalition forces.

A further eight Danish soldiers were killed fighting alongside US forces in Iraq between 2003 and 2007.

The AP news agency spoke to two Danish veterans who said they understand Arctic security concerns but believe Denmark is committed to defending the region within NATO.

""When America needed us after 9/11 we were there,"" said Martin Tamm Andersen, 46, a former Danish platoon commander whose vehicle struck an improvised explosive device (IED) in southern Afghanistan in 2010.

""As a veteran and as a Dane, you feel sad and very surprised that the US wants to take over part of the Kingdom of Denmark,"" he said. ""It's a betrayal of the loyalty of our nation to the US and to our common alliance, NATO.""

Fellow Danish veteran Soren Knudsen also said that the US takeover of Greenland would mark ""the final moment of my admiration and love of what has been the American experiment for 250 years.""

""I would be very sorry if it happened, because I would also see this as the final moments of the NATO alliance,"" Knudsen said.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said he ""would not speculate"" on whether the NATO alliance has been shattered beyond repair by US President Donald Trump's threats to take over Greenland, but insisted that European allies ""will not accept [being] blackmailed"" by Washington.

Asked by a journalist on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos whether Sweden regrets abandoning its decades-old policy of neutrality and joining NATO in 2024, Kristersson said: ""Absolutely not.""

""We are in very good cooperation with 31 allies within NATO, we are [making] great progress, we are being integrated very rapidly and we are already making big efforts to increase NATO's combined capacities in our part of the world,"" he said, adding that this included a willingness to beef up security in Greenland and across the Arctic.

Republicans in Washington have carved up a cake shaped like Greenland as they celebrated Donald Trump's deal on the future of the island.

Supporters of the US president cheered at an event at the Kennedy Center as they cut up the dessert – which was iced with an American flag – in an apparent nod to the United States's bid to annex the Arctic territory.

On Wednesday, Mr Trump claimed to have struck a deal with Mark Rutte, Nato's secretary general, on a “future framework” for Greenland and the “entire Arctic region”.

The Telegraph has revealed that the US would control parts of Greenland, where it would operate sovereign bases, under the terms of the proposed agreement.

In a clip of the Washington event, which was shared on social media, partygoers gathered around the cake and one person could be heard saying: “It's gonna be an international incident!”

Attendees could be heard cheering as the cake was cut, with Michael Casey, a Republican who uploaded the video on X, saying: “51st state!”

The cake was cut by Anna Paulina Luna, a congresswoman for Florida, while congressmen Abe Hamadeh, of Arizona, and Andy Ogles, of Tennessee, watched on.

Ms Luna, who has supported the Trump administration's military operation in Venezuela, later shared a photo of the cake on X, tagging the Danish prime minister.

The event in Washington was held to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the start of Mr Trump's second term in office.

It was hosted by the Republicans for National Renewal, a Right-wing group that wants Mr Trump to run for a third term in office, which is currently outlawed by the US Constitution.

Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Trump had demanded the right to buy Greenland from Denmark during a two-hour speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

He claimed the US was owed the island in return for defeating the Nazis and criticised European allies who had opposed his threat to take the territory by force.

“All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,” he told delegates in Switzerland.

“It's the United States alone that can protect this giant mass of land, this giant piece of ice, develop it and improve it and make it so that it's good for Europe and safe for Europe and good for us.”

The Department of Homeland Security is actively recruiting from the far right as it seeks to hire 10,000 ICE agents.

Under Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has gone on an explicitly fascist zag as it seeks to recruit 10,000 additional U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

Robert Reich and others have detailed in recent weeks how ICE is now actively seeking to recruit extremist young men from gun shows, Ultimate Fight Club venues, rodeos, martial arts centers, and other haunts for men who tend to have a far right political vision.

ICE is actively employing recruiters who use right-wing social media and influencer operations to get at potential recruits. And it is explicitly targeting young men who listen to “patriotic” (in other words, hard-right) podcasts. Part of ICE's “wartime recruitment” schtick now involves asking potential applicants if they want to repel “foreign invaders” — and then offering them $50,000 sign-up bonuses if they decide to join.

The Southern Poverty Law Center has, over the past year, researched the increasingly extreme language and imagery used in these recruitment campaigns. They include a “Your Country Needs You” poster of Uncle Sam, from August of last year, in which Uncle Sam asks “Which way, American Man?” One arrow points to “Invasion,” another to “Cultural Decline,” while a third points toward Uncle Sam and reads “Homeland.”

ICE is now actively seeking to recruit extremist young men from gun shows.

Another shows a father-son combo, both with features that the Nazis would have deemed acceptably “Aryan,” clad in body armor and holding assault rifles, with the caption “No Age Cap. Join ICE Now.”

Still another Uncle Sam recruitment poster from the summer reads, “America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.” Other recruitment posters include a photo of a spacious family van, alongside the words “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys? Think about how many criminal illegal aliens you could fit in this bad boy!”

A recent poster, shot from above, shows knights in armor, swords in both hands, in a circle, sword tips pointing inward, and a decal “THE ENEMIES ARE AT THE GATE. JOIN.ICE.GOV.” The agency is also using memes from popular video games to further their recruitment efforts.

Meanwhile, on January 9, DHS and the White House posted a recruitment video on Instagram titled “We'll have our home again,” accompanied by a visual image of a heroic-looking cowboy riding along the base of snow-covered mountains, and the Pine Tree Riots song “We'll have our home again,” which has, according to The Intercept, become increasingly popular within neo-Nazi subcultures.

ICE's “wartime recruitment” schtick now involves asking potential applicants if they want to repel “foreign invaders” — and then offering them $50,000 sign-up bonuses.

The chorus to this truly appalling song is “Oh by God we'll have our home again/ By God we'll have our home/ By blood or sweat, we'll get there yet/ By God we'll have our home.” The verses lament that “in our own towns, we're foreigners now/ Our names are spat and cursed.” And they decry the fate of “noble sons driven down beneath a coward's heel.” Not surprisingly, these lyrics are beloved by Proud Boys and other extremists — and now, apparently, by recruitment officers and propagandists at ICE.

Not to be outdone, the U.S. Department of Labor recently released on Facebook the following message: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American” — a phrase that strongly echoed a slogan used within Nazi propaganda.

In many of these instances, the visual and audio similarities to Nazi wartime messaging is stark. ICE is using World War II recruitment memes; but it has inverted their meaning, so that classic American symbols, from Uncle Sam to the Statue of Liberty, are being invoked in service of a fanatical vision of purity and oneness.

In the wake of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on January 7, the increasingly extremist agency has refused to modify its behavior or rhetoric.

The circumstances of Good's killing were particularly egregious: she was shot at least four times by agent Jonathan Ross, who shouted “fucking bitch” as he fired at her while she was clearly trying to drive away from the protest; and her reputation was subsequently slimed by Noem, Donald Trump, JD Vance, and other high-level administration officials who all accused her, without evidence, of being a paid agitator and a domestic terrorist. Those officials then doubled down and, even before any investigation had been carried out, claimed, as Vance put it, that Ross had “absolute immunity” for his actions on the streets of Minneapolis. To protect Ross's impunity, the FBI, under the egregious leadership of Kash Patel, has refused to share evidence with state investigators.

As anti-ICE protests spread, if anything, its parent organization DHS is upping the ante: days after the killing of Good, the department surged an additional 1,000 agents into Minneapolis, and the Department of Justice is moving federal prosecutors from around the Midwest into Minnesota to faster process the prosecution of protesters.

None of this has been conducive to assuaging growing national anger about ICE's tactics — tactics that even MAGA luminary Joe Rogan opposes: Rogan recently described Trump's ICE as behaving like “the Gestapo.”

The visual and audio similarities to Nazi wartime messaging is stark.

Each day since Good's killing, the protests have grown, only to be met with the deployment of masked, armed federal agents in military uniforms who have turned parts of Minneapolis into what looks like a war zone; and last week, on the same day that ICE agents shot another Minneapolis resident, this time non-fatally, Trump declared that he was leaning toward invoking the Insurrection Act so as to bring in active-duty military personnel to target the protesters.

Trump and his anti-immigrant wingman Stephen Miller seem to want to turn urban centers of the United States into permanent war zones, akin to Belfast during the Northern Irish “Troubles,” or the West Bank today.

DHS's explicit use of neo-Nazi references and imagery to recruit new agents for its rapidly expanding ICE force is a grim warning of where we are headed.

The scramble to pack ICE with far right recruits and instill in them a sense of total impunity risks pushing ICE toward becoming an organization similar to the Black and Tans in Ireland a little over a century ago — a group of British ex-soldiers who were hired by the British administration in Ireland to dole out death and torture against Irish civilians, raining down terror on public events and private homes alike in their effort to keep Ireland under the British imperial thumb.

As ICE deploys its forces to occupy immigrant neighborhoods of big, Democratic-run cities, its tactics resemble the way Israel polices Palestinians — ruthlessly and violently, with a nod-and-a-wink to civilian and military officers who know they will be exonerated if they shoot civilians. In both cases, the occupying police forces are quick to use baseless accusations of “terrorism” to justify their violence.

The day after Good was killed by ICE, DHS Secretary Noem spoke from a platform bedecked with the message “One of ours, all of yours,” seemingly implying that, in violation both of the law and of age-old moral codes, her department endorses collective punishment.

This is the U.S. in 2026. If there is an afterlife, I'm sure Joseph Goebbels, master propagandist of the Third Reich, is looking down and smiling, thin-lipped and cold-eyed, with approval.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks.

We can only resist Trump's attacks by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

 Elite Fracture Will Come Gradually and Then Suddenly

 Afshon Ostovar

Over the last few weeks, the Iranian regime has faced remarkable challenges—and displayed remarkable unity. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians have taken to the streets to protest the Islamic Republic in what has become the most significant internal challenge the state has faced in its 47-year history. But the elite has not yet fractured. Instead of squabbling over how to handle the demonstrations, Iran's reformist and hardline leaders have worked together to suppress them. To date, none of the regime's elites objected to the killings of thousands of innocent civilians by security forces. In fact, figures from across the political spectrum have all outwardly (and falsely) blamed the violence on foreign infiltrators.

But behind the scenes, the picture is undoubtedly more tense. Unless they exclusively watch state television and believe their own false narratives, Iranian officials understand that the domestic system is under existential stress. They are aware that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to attack Tehran and topple the government. And most of them probably know that the forces driving the protests—including an economic crisis and decades of corruption—cannot be fixed by the country's obstinate, reactionary leadership. As a result, Iranian officials who want to save themselves have an incentive to remove Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei from power.

If Iran's elites do move on Khamenei, they will likely act quickly. There will be no sign to outsiders that a coup is coming. And if they succeed, a range of outcomes are possible. The Iranian apparatus has a stark divide between its older and younger generation, and so the character of the next government would depend on which cohort ends up leading it. If the old guard is behind a successful coup, Iran's next regime will probably remain theocratic at home but become less ambitious abroad. If younger officials take over, Iran will likely grow less religious at home but remain assertive internationally.

Neither camp is likely to bring about democracy. The reason that either group would depose Khamenei, after all, is to preserve its influence. An internal move against the supreme leader would still evince the further erosion of the Islamic Republic. But the uncomfortable truth is that democracy and freedom in Iran will require either external support or that factions inside the ruling system, backed by a segment of the armed forces, join with the Iranian people. Short of that, any political change in Tehran is more likely to be about preserving aspects of the status quo.

For decades, predicting the end of the Islamic Republic has been a fool's errand. The regime has faced all kinds of crises—wars, mass protests, high inflation—without cracking. Its theocratic system steadily isolated the country, destroyed its economy, and subjected its people to stifling social restrictions. But it retained a powerful security apparatus, and thus proved capable of repeatedly quelling even widespread dissent.

So far, Iran has been able to use its military and police to tamp down on the most recent round of demonstrations. But these protests have, nonetheless, weakened the ruling system. The sheer size, energy, and diversity of this popular uprising—combined with the immense toll of the crackdown—has further rubbished any claim to legitimacy that the Islamic Republic might have hoped to retain among Iran's people. The regime has now lost the support not only of the country's young but also of traditionally conservative cities and regions. It has alienated one of its most important constituencies, the small merchant class, or bazaaris. And unlike others in the not so distant past, these protests have come at a time when Iran is weak. The country's once-vaunted network of regional allies has been greatly degraded, and its economy is suffering from chronic shortages and persistent inflation. The regime, meanwhile, has shown no ability or willingness to make the hard decisions needed to either restore the country's security or improve its economy.

Change will come to Iran; the question is what kind of change it will be. The most obvious transition, and the one that would mirror the desires of the masses who took part in the protest movement, would be a popular revolution that dismantled the Islamic Republic's theocratic system, removed its corrupt elite, and fundamentally transformed Iran's political, economic, and social landscape. Yet for a popular revolution to work, segments of the regime would need to defect to the people's side and support the Islamic Republic's destruction. And, for now, the forces preserving the status quo remain united.



Another way to buoy a popular revolution would be for the world to provide external pressure. As people take to the streets, the United States and its allies could either kill or capture Iran's core leadership, destroy much of the regime's repressive infrastructure, and then install a caretaker government. Such a scenario is the only way to remove the regime from power if its elites refuse to enact change on their own. But although the Trump administration may yet decide to take such a route, a regime change operation carried out by the United States would likely require a substantial commitment by the American military, and so no one should count on it happening. There is also a risk that such an operation might fail to produce a stable, new government even if it succeeds in ousting the old one, and lead to prolonged conflict in the country—particularly if elements of Iran's security forces remain armed and committed to the Islamic Revolution.

That leaves a coup d'état as the most plausible way Iran's present system might fall, at least in the near term. Iranian officials may have a seemingly endless ability to repress their people, but even they cannot escape the uncomfortable truth that the regime has hit a low point and that Khamenei and his chief advisers lack the decisiveness and vision needed to chart a pathway forward. The regime is at risk, but the current leaders are incapable of making fixes. It is exactly at times such as these that elites in authoritarian countries start thinking about saving themselves by deposing their leaders.

Right now, there are no outward signs that regime officials will try to take down Khamenei. There are rumors that certain reformist elites have been taken into custody, but they have not yet been substantiated. Even if conditions worsen and the regime's grasp grows more precarious, some elites will seek to preserve what they have rather than try to effect change: their money will flow to foreign bank accounts, and their extended families will move to vacation homes abroad. But other, more ambitious insiders might start to plot against their superiors.

Such plotting is unlikely to be visible from the outside. The regime is deeply paranoid and constantly hunts for elite schemes that don't exist. But if there were an actual, coordinated effort that had a chance of succeeding, it would likely come without warning and be lightning fast. The ruling apparatus, in other words, would collapse gradually, and then suddenly.

If Iran experiences a coup, it will most likely be carried out by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the most powerful branch of the Iranian military and the strongest actor inside the country. There would be an irony in such a move, because the IRGC serves as the principal guardian of the theocratic system and has benefited the most from Khamenei's tenure. But the corps also has the most to lose if Khamenei is toppled through a popular uprising or through foreign intervention. As a result, should IRGC commanders decide that the supreme leader's power is slipping or that it presents an obstacle to relieving pressure on the regime, they might opt to take ownership of political change in order to preserve their vaunted position.

The IRGC is a sprawling institution, so what happens in the wake of its coup would depend on who leads it. If officials from the corps's intelligence office, whose primary mission is internal security, ended up in charge, the state might turn inward and become even more repressive and paranoid. If a coup originated in the Quds Force, whose primary mission is foreign operations, Iran's external interests would be prioritized.

But the IRGC's most important fault line is less organizational than generational: the institution is divided between its top command and its younger middle-ranking officers. The former are mostly appointees of the supreme leader who gained their positions through their loyalty to Khamenei and their ideological orthodoxy. They got their start soon after Iran's 1979 revolution and bonded on the frontlines of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. They are part of the Islamic Republic's first generation and remain committed to its founding principles, including its Islamist social ordinances and an ideological foreign policy. They have benefitted greatly from their insider status, growing rich through endemic corruption. Their families lead easy lives, often abroad, and they have enjoyed immense influence within the system.

The younger generation, by contrast, started their careers during Iran's post-2003 rise to regional prominence. They are veterans of conflicts in Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria, which gave them a taste of what Iran's power could achieve. Though they are not secular, they have a more pragmatic view of social issues and are thereby less wedded to the social strictures that have defined the Islamic system. They are also more hawkish on foreign policy, more committed to restoring Iran's power, and less hesitant to use military force in the region. But they have not yet had the opportunity to cash in on their status through lucrative command positions and have therefore not materially benefited from systemic corruption to the same degree as their leaders.



If an IRGC coup is led by the organization's elite inner circle, the resulting government might prove willing to compromise on Iran's nuclear and missile programs—both already badly damaged—in exchange for sanctions relief from Western countries. Such a move could assuage Iran's small merchant class, which is concerned about the economy above all else, as well as international actors (including Washington). It might also sap energy from the protests, making them easier to crush. But this old guard would not end Islamic rule nor address the corruption that underlies Iran's economic volatility. Rather, such coup leaders would be acting purely out of self-interest. Their goal would be to safeguard their status in the system and to buy time.

The IRGC's middle-ranking officers, by contrast, would pursue a coup primarily out of ambition. If they stood by and the Islamic Republic ended up collapsing, they would have neither grown fat from corruption nor had a chance to lead the state. Their careers would be cut short. Their prospects under a populist takeover would be dim. A coup would provide them the opportunity to take the reins of the Islamic system and remold it.

The IRGC's younger cohort does have a stake in the present system; its members, too, have benefited financially and politically from their positions. But they do have more reasons to be disillusioned with the supreme leader and his apparatus, which have made terrible decisions that undid the corps's hard-fought regional wins. If they were to lead a coup, the changes to the regime could therefore be more sweeping. These leaders would also probably be more willing to abandon some of the sacred totems of the Islamic system—the role of the supreme leader first and foremost, but also social laws that have radicalized Iran's youth against the regime. They would instead place a greater focus on Iranian nationalism and military might.

But that doesn't mean they would abandon Iran's foreign policy. In fact, as a generation that came up during Iran's rise, they might be even more committed to transforming Tehran into a formidable and respected power than their superiors. The way they do so, however, might shift away from the narrow conception of anti-Western resistance favored by Khamenei. They could remain antagonistic to Israel and retain Iran's focus on regional policy but be more pragmatic in dealing with the United States and less inclined to shore up Tehran's flailing proxies. Moving beyond a foreign policy fixated on backing terrorist groups would help facilitate an expansion in Iran's military power through more conventional means, particularly its evolving ties with China.

Regardless of what faction is behind it, a coup is unlikely to turn Iran into the democracy that its people seek. In fact, preventing that would be the point. A coup would be pursued first and foremost to keep elements of the existing system in place and better insulate them from internal and external pressures, not to fundamentally restructure the regime.

But the splintering of the system's elite would be one more step in the Islamic Republic's dissolution. Khamenei's leadership has clearly failed the Iranian people and kept the regime mired in crisis, and the cumulative stress of persistent conflict, sanctions, and societal unrest is undoubtedly creating friction behind the scenes. A break within the present regime, however it arrives, would at a minimum further weaken the foundations of the theocracy. It would be an admission from insiders that this system is sick and unable to heal itself through constitutional processes.

It would also be a sign that the pressures amassed against the Islamic Republic have, indeed, chipped away at it, bit by bit. Most importantly, it would usher in an era of change—less the preservation of the Islamic Republic than the beginning of its downfall.

 To Broker Peace, America Should Draw on Its Past Successes in the Middle East

 Amr Hamzawy, Sarah Yerkes, and Kathryn Selfe

The United States is once again at the forefront of efforts to establish a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. President Donald Trump's October 2025 cease-fire agreement produced an uneasy truce between the two sides in Gaza, and a United Nations Security Council resolution in the following month approved the outlines of the president's plan for the territory. It envisions the formal dissolution of Hamas as a governing body in Gaza, a U.S.-led Board of Peace to guide redevelopment, and an International Stabilization Force to oversee security and train Palestinian police forces.

In the months since, fighting has continued to flare between Israeli forces and Hamas militants, underlining the urgency of moving beyond the increasingly fragile cease-fire terms toward the next phases envisioned in the peace plan's roadmap. With little trust between Hamas and Israel, the challenges are enormous. Arab countries are watching developments with deep concern. The collapse of previous attempts to find peace in the region—notably, the breakdown in the late 1990s of the process outlined by the Oslo accords—invites fresh cynicism and doubt as a new batch of American leaders attempts to resolve conflict in the Middle East.

But Washington should not be disheartened. Indeed, the United States need only turn to its own record to find examples of how to engineer success and avoid failure. Over the past half century, Washington has played a leading role in the mediation of conflicts in the Middle East—sometimes successfully, sometimes less so. The 1979 Camp David accords reached a peace between Egypt and Israel that holds to this day. The 1994 Jordan-Israel agreement also endures. But subsequent efforts to broker a treaty between Syria and Israel floundered. And, most notably, repeated attempts to achieve a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians have yet to achieve lasting results.

Whether successful or unsuccessful, these efforts have yielded a number of useful lessons on how to conduct negotiations among regional actors. The sustained and active involvement of top-level government officials, for instance, is critical. Shielding participants from political pressures back home has also proved vital. Negotiators should carefully time incentives and penalties to keep talks moving forward. Security guarantees, including through monitoring, peacekeeping forces, and intelligence support, provide needed reassurance. And public diplomacy can help neutralize spoilers and promote constituencies in favor of peace. The Trump administration often styles its policy as mounting a sharp break with the past. But as it tries to usher in peace between Israelis and Palestinians, it should remember that recent history may be the best guide forward.

In the 1970s, Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat's decision to reject alignment with the Soviet Union and seek rapprochement with the United States opened a unique window. Sadat's 1977 Jerusalem visit, despite enormous political risks, jolted the region by signaling that one of Israel's biggest and most hostile foes was ready to make a deal. Henry Kissinger, then the U.S. national security adviser, amplified that momentum with what came to be known as “shuttle diplomacy,” a series of personal interventions that helped to establish common ground. President Jimmy Carter's intensive 1978 Camp David summit with Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin moved the process forward by insulating leaders from political pressures at home and allowing U.S. brokers to sequence negotiations in a way that turned once irreconcilable positions into subjects for discussion. Not only did the summit produce a framework for peace between Egypt and Israel, but it also introduced a five-year transitional timeline toward a fully autonomous and self-governed Palestine. That plan may not have reached fruition, but it marked a significant breakthrough after years of deadlock. At Camp David, Carter shuttled between principals who rarely met face-to-face, limiting political posturing and allowing the United States to apply pressure without damaging either leader's image.

Carter's decision to handle Egyptian-Israeli bilateral issues separately from the Palestinian question proved critical. The Camp David framework allowed negotiators to focus on finite problems (such as the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Sinai and the normalization of ties between Egypt and Israel) while deferring more complex issues to do with the Palestinians. This modular approach reduced the chances of a single issue failing leading to the collapse of the entire negotiations.

Following Camp David, the United States offered substantial economic and military assistance to Egypt, replacing Soviet support and helping Sadat withstand domestic criticism. To Israel, the United States promised security cooperation and advanced military supplies, reducing the perceived costs of Israel's withdrawal from Sinai. The treaty complemented territorial withdrawal with layered security: demilitarization of Sinai, deployment of multinational observer forces, and clear verification protocols.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the United States tackled the far more complex Israeli-Palestinian relationship. Secretary of State James Baker's 1989 “Baker Plan” sought compromise, laying out phases and delineating important roles for Egypt and the United States. But the Madrid conference in 1991, which carried the Baker Plan into a multilateral format, ultimately failed to produce results, diminishing U.S. credibility.

In 1993, in an attempt to revive the stalled peace process, Norway launched secret back-channel negotiations with Palestinians and Israelis. Although this dual channel allowed difficult issues to play out behind closed doors and enabled the eventual (albeit short-lived) success of the Oslo accords, it undercut U.S. leadership in negotiations, limiting Washington's ability to sway the outcome.

The Oslo accords succeeded in getting Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to formally recognize each other, but it intentionally left the wording of the agreement vague. It included no mention of either the creation of a Palestinian state or the end of the Israeli occupation. This phased approach, while well intentioned, left many opportunities for spoilers.

Additionally, Israel's continued settlement expansion in the West Bank in the early 1990s undermined the accords by eroding Palestinian trust. In 1990, Baker threatened to withhold $10 billion of loan guarantees if settlement construction didn't stop. Years later, the United States tried to offer Israel incentives not to build settlements, such as expanded military assistance. Unfortunately, neither inducements nor penalties proved effective in reining in the Israelis.



But perhaps the most catastrophic failure of the Oslo process was inadequately preparing the Israeli and Palestinian publics to accept peace, allowing spoilers on both sides to disrupt the peace process and culminating in the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and the eruption of the second intifada in 2000.

The United States made multiple errors that doomed Oslo. First, focusing on confidence-building measures and interim steps, rather than a comprehensive agreement, unintentionally created the conditions for failure because these gains involved minimal compromise, which disincentivized serious progress. Second, tabling “final status issues” that were ostensibly the primary aim of the negotiations led to hollow agreements that never addressed the most important parts of the conflict.

The United States did provide serious incentives to both sides. During the Oslo process, the United States organized a multilateral donor conference that secured around $3.6 billion in pledges to build a constituency for peace among Israelis and Palestinians by buttressing the Israeli and Palestinian economies and supporting the newly established Palestinian Authority. To secure the Wye River memorandum in 1998 (which aimed, among other things, to implement previously agreed-upon phased redeployments of Israeli troops from portions of the West Bank), the United States guaranteed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an additional $1.2 billion in military aid and promised the Palestinians economic assistance if both sides adequately implemented the terms of Wye. The United States also offered Israel informal security guarantees, including ensuring Israel's qualitative military edge over all its neighbors and rivals and increased intelligence sharing.

The Oslo experience makes clear that sustained, high-level U.S. engagement is not enough to guarantee success. Spoilers—largely domestic publics on both sides—sabotaged Oslo's implementation. The United States failed to adequately prepare publics for peace or convince Israeli and Palestinian publics that peace would improve their lives. Moreover, the accords set no measurable benchmarks for either side and imposed no consequences for inaction, making it easier for disgruntled actors to upend the process.

Despite its flaws, Oslo did open a window of opportunity for another regional power to seek peace with Israel. After witnessing the early success of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, Jordan launched a fresh peace initiative in the early 1990s. Jordan's desire to reconcile with the United States after the Gulf War (in which Jordan effectively backed Iraq), combined with Israel's desire to stabilize its eastern front, spurred discussions between the two countries. King Hussein visited Washington in June 1993 and outlined Jordan's needs, including debt forgiveness. President Bill Clinton took Jordan's demands seriously, but he warned that it could be difficult to gain congressional approval for aid.

The process moved quickly. A “common agenda” was signed just one day afterthe Palestinians and Israelis signed the declaration of principles, which defined core negotiation areas and committed the parties to a phased path toward a final peace treaty. The United States kept both Israel and Jordan engaged by focusing initial negotiations on economic development and cooperation, gradually building trust between both sides. By keeping initial negotiations in Washington and insisting each meeting produce progress, the United States protected both parties from external pressures and avoided losing momentum.

In mid-July 1993, King Hussein gave a speech in which he expressed willingness to publicly meet Rabin, injecting new momentum into negotiations. That allowed the United States to orchestrate a highly publicized trilateral meeting involving both heads of state, which brought the peace process into the public eye. Washington moved quickly to secure a breakthrough. Negotiations on contentious land and water issues soon commenced, and approximately three months later, a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan was signed.



Washington upheld its promise to ease Jordan's debts. The United States also guaranteed the Jordanian government loans, assisted with the country's agricultural needs, and provided it with military equipment. As with the Oslo accords, the primary hurdle came from how domestic publics and regional neighbors would receive the deal. In this case, tangible incentives, alongside phased negotiations, helped local populations—primarily the disgruntled Jordanians—gradually accept the terms and benefits of peace.

Negotiations between Israel and Syria, by contrast, did not reach successful conclusions. The Clinton administration made sustained efforts throughout the late 1990s to bridge differences regarding the Golan Heights and border security with the aim of normalizing ties. But Clinton failed to apply enough credible pressure on either side. Throughout negotiations, the Clinton administration prioritized the Palestinian and Jordanian tracks, freezing and restarting the Syria process multiple times. U.S. credibility suffered when the administration failed to follow up on a tentative promise that Israel would withdraw from the Golan Heights. By the time the Syria negotiations restarted, Israel was no longer willing to withdraw from the Golan Heights.

The Syria track failed to yield substantial progress because of mistakes by the United States as well as the complexity of the conflict itself. Unlike Sinai, the Golan Heights had a great deal of strategic value as high ground overlooking northern Israel. For Syria, recovering the Golan Heights was tied to national pride and political legitimacy. Negotiators never managed to overcome these obstacles.

The achievements and failures of past U.S.-led Middle East peace negotiations offer a useful guide for the Trump administration today. The most successful U.S. mediation efforts—Egypt-Israel and Jordan-Israel—featured the sustained engagement of U.S. presidents at critical moments, combined with support by senior U.S. officials that maintained Washington's credibility as an honest broker.

When it comes to the future of Gaza, Trump must personally insert himself into negotiations at decisive junctures, following Carter's Camp David model of separating principals and acting as a true mediator. Trump must gain and maintain the trust of both sides, know their priorities intimately, and be willing to apply pressure when necessary—and not just to offer them inducements. Although the U.S.-led Board of Peace provides an institutional framework, Trump's desire to personally chair the board risks backfiring given his perceived pro-Israel stance. Instead, the United States should appoint respected regional partners or international figures to visible positions while maintaining behind-the-scenes control, ensuring that the board is trusted by both Palestinians and Israelis.

Negotiators should also strive to create an environment for talks that is insulated from domestic pressures. Ideally, that would be on American soil, with U.S. teams offering continuous support in designing implementable arrangements for the governance of Gaza and its reconstruction. The United States must stay focused throughout implementation, avoiding the Clinton administration's error of repeatedly freezing and restarting negotiations during its talks with Syria and Israel.

Phased approaches work when they include binding timetables, tangible early wins, and clear pathways to final resolution as happened with Egypt's gradual but well-defined peace process with Israel—but they fail when they defer difficult issues indefinitely or lack enforcement mechanisms. For Gaza, the United States must establish specific, measurable benchmarks with defined deadlines for each phase. On January 14, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, announced the start of phase two of the process, which is supposed to launch the reconstruction of Gaza and the demilitarization of Hamas. Washington must be prepared to impose consequences if parties fail to meet deadlines: withholding economic incentives, reducing diplomatic support, or excluding parties from trade preferences, just as Baker threatened to hold back loan guarantees in 1990. Early phases must deliver concrete benefits for the Israeli and Palestinian populations, such as humanitarian relief, the beginning of reconstruction, and the reduction of violence. This will demonstrate the tangible value of peace in people's lives.

Crucially, the United States must avoid Oslo's mistake of indefinitely deferring final status issues. Although sequencing allows trust-building before tackling contentious issues, failure to define end goals makes negotiations hollow. Washington must establish a clear political horizon explicitly linking the stabilization of Gaza to broader final status negotiations on Palestinian statehood. (It should be noted that the Trump administration so far seems uninterested in taking such a step.) One potential approach might entail working with Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to promise more regional normalization with Israel in return for concrete progress on Palestinian statehood; in turn, Israel could make concessions on this issue conditional on the stability of Gaza. This will create meaningful incentives for sustained engagement.

U.S. mediation succeeds when incentive packages are substantial enough to alter domestic political calculations and strategically timed to reward progress. For Palestinians today, meaningful short-run incentives could include the comprehensive reconstruction of Gaza with international funding coordinated through the Board of Peace, measures that would not just provide immediate humanitarian relief but also supply infrastructure investment that generates jobs and convinces Gazans of the merits of the peace deal. In the long run, the United States must clearly link success in Gaza to final status negotiations that provide a credible pathway to a Palestinian state.



For Israel, the promise of a transformational Abraham Accords agreement with Saudi Arabia—a goal Netanyahu has long pursued—could be made contingent on meaningful progress in Gaza coupled with the reform of the Palestinian Authority and the development of a framework for negotiations toward a Palestinian state. The United States should also guarantee Israel's qualitative military edge, share advanced intelligence on Hamas and other regional threats, and offer diplomatic support in international forums. These incentives, however, must be explicitly conditioned on Israel fulfilling its end of the bargain. For example, any increase in military aid should be tied to Israel freezing the construction of settlements and withdrawing to agreed-upon lines in Gaza.

To regional partners, including Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, the United States should offer enhanced trade agreements, development assistance, and greater diplomatic collaboration as inducements for supporting the peace process and contributing to the reconstruction of Gaza and the training of new Palestinian security forces. All incentives must be dependent on those countries delivering their promised contributions.

Durable peace requires security arrangements that protect all parties' vital interests through layered guarantees, independent monitoring, and phased transitions that build confidence. In 1979, Israel's withdrawal from Sinai went hand in hand with demilitarization, the deployment of a multinational observer forces, clear verification protocols, and the U.S.-backed Multinational Force and Observers that continues to operate today. In contrast, the greater strategic value of the Golan Heights made security guarantees far more difficult to structure and contributed to the failure of talks between Syria and Israel in the 1990s.

The International Stabilization Force envisioned in the Trump plan must have a clear, limited mandate focused on monitoring the disarmament of Hamas, preventing violence, and supporting the training of Palestinian security services. The force must be seen as absolutely neutral and trusted by both parties, requiring Arab and European contingents alongside any potential U.S. participation. Following the Egyptian-Israeli model, the United States should establish robust independent verification protocols for key benchmarks—Hamas disarmament, Israeli withdrawal, and the cessation of settlement expansion in the West Bank—using satellite monitoring, on-the-ground inspectors, and regular UN Security Council reporting.

Responsibility for security in Gaza should transfer gradually from international forces to Palestinian authorities. Each transition phase must include mechanisms for enforcing standards (such as reversibility clauses). The United States should work with regional partners—particularly Egypt and Jordan—to provide training and support for Palestinian police forces. Finally, the United States should facilitate ongoing trilateral security coordination among Israel, Palestinian authorities, and regional partners to ensure sustainable long-term arrangements.

If the United States wants the Gaza peace process to succeed, it must ensure that people on both sides experience immediate concrete improvements that help demonstrate the merits of the deal. For Palestinians, this means rapid humanitarian relief, reconstruction that creates jobs, and visible progress toward self-governance. For Israelis, this means greater security and the economic benefits that come with Israel's closer integration in the region through the normalization of its ties with more of its Arab neighbors.

The costs of failure are immense. The catastrophe in Gaza would continue to smolder for many years to come, creating further turmoil not just for Israelis and Palestinians but for the region and beyond. The Trump administration would be well advised to consider the lessons of history if it wishes to avoid this fate.

Renee Good killed

BH Whipple Federal Building

Tensions are high in Minneapolis after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, in her SUV earlier this month. Good's death sparked outrage against ICE's continued presence and the Department of Homeland Security's aggressive tactics by armed, masked agents in the Twin Cities — in both immigration enforcement operations and crackdowns on protesters.

DHS has poured thousands of federal agents into the cities, greatly outnumbering the combined sworn police officers that Minneapolis and St. Paul have, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said federal agents had arrested 3,000 “criminal” undocumented immigrants in Minnesota over the last six weeks, as of January 19.

“DHS is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters,” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN.

The Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers to prepare for possible deployment to Minnesota, according to a Trump administration source, while state officials have mobilized — but not yet deployed — the Minnesota National Guard.

CNN reviewed and geolocated videos that demonstrate just some examples of federal agents' tactics in the Twin Cities. They have detained both suspected undocumented immigrants and US citizens, used pepper balls, tear gas and pepper spray against protesters, and stopped a citizen to ask for identification and where he was born because of his accent.

ICE agent fatally shoots Renee Good

CNN obtained multiple angles of the fatal shooting by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. Noem said Good “weaponized” her vehicle and that the agent responded in defense of his life. State and local officials have repeatedly disputed claims that the shooting of the Minneapolis mother of three was done in self-defense.

Confrontation outside a public school

On the day of Good's fatal shooting, a Border Patrol agent visibly shoves somebody and a person is detained by agents. A DHS spokesperson said agents were chasing a US citizen “actively trying to impede operations,” and the pursuit ended near the school. Students and staff were never targeted, DHS said, saying a teacher assaulted an agent and the crowd threw objects and paint, prompting “targeted crowd control.”

Video obtained by CNN

Agents use chemical irritants and pepper balls

Federal agents push back a crowd of protesters, shooting pepper balls at their feet and spraying an orange chemical irritant from a can, near the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building. According to CNN's Omar Jimenez, who was on the scene, law enforcement presence increased significantly after several instances of cars being hit with snow and ice, or protesters trying to block vehicles from leaving the facility.

Agent shoves man blocking ICE vehicle into oncoming traffic

A man stops in front of an ICE vehicle as it begins moving. An ICE agent pushes the man, causing him to fall into oncoming traffic. A bus about to pass by the scene comes to a quick stop after he falls. CNN has reached out to DHS for comment.

Agents tackle and detain anti-ICE protester

A masked agent yells ""Get back!"" and pushes a protester, who swats the agent's hand away before getting tackled to the ground by several agents. After being detained the man is carried away and placed in an SUV. DHS said the US citizen was arrested after he didn't comply with the order to stay back and responded by hitting an officer.

Woman stands her ground when agents ask for ID

A woman says she was surrounded by federal agents on the sidewalk, asking for identification and where she was born. The woman says she doesn't need to carry ID and eventually the agents return to their vehicle. DHS said “a person's immigration status makes them a target for enforcement, not their skin color, race or ethnicity.”

Man is pepper sprayed in confrontation with ICE agents

A man is pepper sprayed in a confrontation with agents near where Renee Good was fatally shot. DHS said officers “were swarmed by approximately 100 agitators who surrounded law enforcement and began throwing objects at them, threatening them, blocking their exit, and impeding their lawful operations. Officers called for backup and were forced to deploy tear gas and other crowd control techniques.”

Agents drag woman out of her car

Agents surround Aliya Rahman's car, smash her window and cut her seatbelt off as she yells she's disabled. She told CNN she wasn't part of the protest and was going to a doctor's appointment. DHS said she was arrested for obstruction after ignoring commands to move her vehicle away from the scene.

Agent detains US citizen after he refuses to show ID requested “because of your accent”

Ramon Menera was detained outside his home in a Minneapolis suburb in front of his 5-year-old daughter after a US Border Patrol agent accused him of not being a US citizen because of his accent, he told CNN. DHS told CNN an agent recognized his accent as being from Mexico and that Menera initially lied to agents about where he was born. Agents let Menera go after reviewing his paperwork, he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Federal authorities have called those who monitor ICE ‘domestic terrorists.' Here's what we know","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/22/us/ice-watch-observers-federal-agents","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 09:01:00 GMT","


            One day after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis earlier this month, a Minnesota immigrant advocacy group reported a threefold increase in the number of people signing up to become legal observers.
    


            “To say this: The killing of Renee Good lit a fire under the community, would be an understatement,” said Ryan Perez, a leadership and organizing director with the advocacy group COPAL, part of a network of 5,000 trained civilians who monitor immigration enforcement. “It really is a remarkable moment.”
    


            As the Trump administration deploys thousands of federal officers to carry out turbocharged immigration operations across the country – with the Minneapolis area now the epicenter – growing networks of volunteers who call themselves ICE observers appear to be intensifying their efforts.
    


            Volunteers document arrests, some tail ICE agents in vehicles, while others blow whistles warning community members of ICE enforcement –– tactics under increased scrutiny since the fatal shooting, which has led to more aggressive enforcement operations and sparked protests across the US.
    


            Good, who served on the board of her son's school, was linked, in school documents, to similar activities encouraging parents to monitor and possibly disrupt ICE operations –– an association Trump officials are placing at the center of their review into the incident as the activist and mother of three partially blocked ICE agents with her car.
    


Woman dragged from car by ICE speaks exclusively to CNN



            An ICE officer who was filming Good shot her after she started to accelerate her SUV on January 7. Videos of the encounter show Good was turning her vehicle away from the agent as she pulled forward, but it is unclear whether she made contact with him before he fired.
    


            Experts say while some practices by volunteers are acts of nonviolent civil disobedience, others may fall into murkier legal territory. Here's what we know.
    

CNN's Isabel Rosales went on a ride-a-long with residents who are monitoring federal agents in real time. They are part of a network of five thousand civilians called ""legal observers"" who are responding to tips that immigration enforcement is around. With the increase of federal agents in Minnesota, they say they are responding to more activity everyday.


            Across the country, thousands of parents, teachers, clergy members and community organizers have sought training on what they can legally do when they see an immigration arrest. They have been trained on documenting federal immigration agents' actions with cell phone video and quickly warning migrant neighbors with whistles and car horns.
    


            “People that look a lot like Renee Good, we have a lot of moms. We have a lot of retirees, people that would be volunteering at the ballot box,” Perez said of the volunteers.
    


            Kateri Heymans, a 29-year-old Spanish teacher in Minneapolis, registered as an observer the day after Good was fatally shot.  She said she was alarmed by the number of  federal agents flooding her hometown and the violent scenes that have accompanied their presence.
    


            In North Carolina, the immigrant worker group Siembra NC operates an ICE watch hotline and a verification system tracking the operations of federal agents in the community.
    


            “Safety concerns are a daily reality,” said Andrew Wills Garces, a senior strategist with Siembra NC. “After the killing of Renee Nicole Good, our volunteers are asking, ‘Can they get away with this?' They see an administration labeling legal observers as ‘domestic terrorists' and feel a target on their backs.”
    


            Nationwide, volunteers are being trained not only to honk horns and blow whistles to warn anyone in earshot immigration agents are present but also to document the actions of federal officers.
    


            Critics of the immigration crackdown say observers are necessary given what they describe as dangerous tactics by federal agents which put people at risk. Trump administration officials counter they are taking necessary steps to keep Americans safe, and ICE officers are facing a significant increase in assaults. Officers exercise restraint despite facing threats and attacks, according to federal officials.
    


Trump administration asks judge to reject Minnesota's bid to stop immigration crackdown



            “Our observers are trained to walk in and say, ‘I demand to see a warrant. Show me a warrant. I need to see a signed judicial warrant. Why are you here? What are you doing here?' And all of that creates a legal record as well,” Perez said.
    


            Their notes and videos are shared with attorneys and advocacy groups to be used in possible court cases, he said. Volunteers also watch video of enforcement actions and participate in simulations as part of their training.
    


            “If you're in a public space, using whistles to signal that law enforcement officers are present and recording law enforcement activities are expressive activities protected by the First Amendment,” said Gregory Magarian, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.
    


            “If we take the First Amendment seriously, and if we look at our nation's history, we see that a wide range of protest and pushback activities are protected by the First Amendment … and have been essential to social movements – the Civil Rights Movement, women's suffrage, the run-up to the American Revolution itself – that almost everyone views positively.”
    


            Tim Zick, a professor at William and Mary Law School in Virginia, said some volunteers have sought to identify mostly masked ICE officers by badge numbers or other accessible information, occasionally posting information about their identities online.
    


            “In some communities, activists have posted fliers with information about the ICE agents involved in arrests and other actions in the community,” he said.
    


            Distribution of factual and lawfully obtained public information is generally protected by the First Amendment, according to Zick.
    


            “The Trump administration has initiated investigations and prosecutions of some activists who have posted information about agents online or distributed it,” Zick said.
    


            But context matters.
    


Trump officials investigate protesters who interrupted Minnesota church service, targeting ICE official



            “If the information is posted with the intent or purpose of inciting violence against agents or threatening them, it may not be protected. However, it appears the administration has adopted the view that any posting of personal information regarding ICE agents is unlawful. That position is contrary to First Amendment case law.”
    


            President Donald Trump has warned leaders in Minnesota he may be forced to intervene further if widespread protests continue during his administration's surge in immigration enforcement operations.
    


            “In Minnesota, the Troublemakers, Agitators, and Insurrectionists are, in many cases, highly paid professionals,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday.
    


            ICE watch activities and protests appear to be escalating as aggressive arrests become more common in public, with some federal officers using tactics such as shattering car windows and tackling their targets.

            Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has said agents who “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law” are facing “smearing” by claims they're employing “harsher approaches.”
    


            “ICE and CBP (Customs and Border Protection) are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” McLaughlin told CNN. “Our officers are highly trained in de-escalation tactics and regularly receive ongoing use of force training.”
    


            Physically interfering with the actions of agents is illegal.
    


            “If a person directly interferes with a law enforcement officer, for example by deliberately blocking the officer's path, that is not protected by the First Amendment and is generally unlawful,” Magarian said.
    


            It is also unlawful to disobey an order from law enforcement to disperse, he said.
    


            Zick said posting threats to federal agents is unlawful and not protected speech.
    


            “So is inciting others to engage in unlawful actions against the agents, if the incitement is likely to produce an imminent attack,” he added.

            Perez, the Minneapolis activist who trains ICE watchers, said his group instructs volunteers to stay eight feet away from agents and to avoid touching or blocking them.
    


            “We have a 100% no obstruction protocol as observers,” he insisted.
    


            Perez added, “We have people that were so afraid before and I think the fear is still there. There's so much violence from law enforcement against community members and yet there's also more bravery than ever … because people are feeling like, ‘Now's my time to act.'”

Live Updates


• Ukraine talks: After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, US President Donald Trump said there's still “a ways to go” on ending Russia's war. Zelensky noted that documents aimed at stopping the conflict are “nearly ready” and also called out Europe for inaction.
    


            • Greenland deal progress: ﻿Trump said negotiations regarding Greenland currently give US “total access” for defense. While Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reached a verbal understanding about Greenland yesterday, no document has been produced yet memorializing a future deal, sources say.
    


            • “Board of Peace”: Trump earlier unveiled his “Board of Peace,” which is tasked with rebuilding Gaza and resolving global conflicts, in a signing ceremony attended by fewer than 20 countries. He called Gaza a “beautiful piece of property” when talking about reconstruction of the war-torn strip.
    


            Residents in Greenland have reacted cautiously to US President Donald Trump's apparent U-turn on using force to take control of the territory, welcoming his change of heart, while remaining skeptical about his actions.
    


            CNN's Nic Robertson spoke to residents in the capital Nuuk, finding a mix of relief and lingering anxiety driven by what many described as the US president's unpredictability.
    


                    “You never know what he says next week. That's the problem with him, I think. I don't know if we can trust him,” Nuuk resident Putsi told Robertson today.
                





            Another resident, Aqqalu Frederiksen, said he felt some reassurance after Trump signaled he would not use force to acquire the island, but stressed that doubts persist.
    


                    “I'm kind of relieved that he is saying that he won't use force or anything like that, but it's, it's quite unsure, I mean … Trump is an unpredictable man,” Frederiksen said.
                





            Frederiksen went on to describe Trump's initial threats as “quite terrifying,” pointing to the US capture of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela.
    


            Robertson also spoke to Greenlandic member of parliament Margrethe Thårup Andersen, asking whether the threat of Trump attempting to take over the territory had now passed.
    


                    “He's not predictable,” she said.
                





            Despite those concerns, many Greenlanders said their trust lies firmly with Denmark, the European Union and Greenland's own government.
    


            “I trust the European Union. I trust Denmark. And our Greenlandic government,” Putsi said.
    


            Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Thursday that he wasn't sure “what's concrete” in US President Donald Trump's announced “framework” for a “future deal” on Greenland.
    


                    “Nobody else than Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark have the mandate to make deals or agreements about Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark without us,” Nielsen told CNN's Nic Robertson at a press conference in Nuuk.
                





            Trump yesterday announced that he had achieved the new “framework” after a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Nielsen said he understood that at that meeting, Rutte “delivered the message that we actually have delivered a couple of days ago with our representative from the government of Greenland.”
    


                    “What we have said from the beginning is we want a respectful, peaceful relationship and a strong partnership as an ally,” Nielsen said. “But no doubt, the rhetoric we have heard the last year is unacceptable for us.”
                





            The prime minister added that Greenland is open to any number of plans to further integrate into NATO, including through a “permanent mission” on the island, so long as any plans emerge from a baseline of “respect” for their sovereignty.
    


            “We have a responsibility,” Nielsen said. “So, let's talk about it through the right channels, in a respectful manner. Then I'm sure we can work something out that benefits.”
    


            Greenland's sovereignty and territorial integrity is a “red line,” Nielsen continued. Earlier in the press conference, he told reporters that Greenland's position is clear.
    


                    “To summarize, we choose the Kingdom of Denmark,” Nielsen said. “We choose the EU, we choose NATO. This is not only a situation for Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark, it's about the world order for all of us.”
                





            Ukrainian, US and Russian officials are to hold a trilateral meeting in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced Thursday, in a sign that peace talks to end the war in Ukraine are intensifying.
    


            The two-day meeting will take place on Friday and Saturday, the Ukrainian leader said as he delivered a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
    


            Speaking to reporters later, Zelensky revealed that the Ukrainian delegation will include the head and deputy head of his presidential office, Kyrylo Budanov and Serhii Kyslytsia; the head of the parliamentary faction of Zelensky's Servant of the People party and negotiator, David Arakhamia; and the Chief of the General Staff Andrii Hnatov.
    


            “I asked Hnatov to fly in from Kyiv; the military must be present,” Zelensky told the reporters.
    


            “We are at the moment when, I think, if all the sides will work a lot, we will end this war, but if somebody will play the games, I don't know who, but I'm just sharing with you. If someone will play games, the war will continue,” he said.
    


            This was a very strident broadside by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky against European leaders he says have not done enough over the past year. They remain, he said, “in Greenland mode, maybe someone, somewhere will do something.”
    


            Zelensky thanked France and the UK for offering troops in the event of a peace deal, but otherwise tried to stir European leaders – still reeling from US President Donald Trump's whirlwind of noise around Greenland – into action to forge a new world order. “We need something to replace the old world order with, but where are the leaders to do that?” he said.
    


            Zelensky revealed plans for US, Russian and Ukrainian leaders to meet in the United Arab Emirates in the coming days, for what would mark the first trilateral meeting since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Trump had floated such an idea late last year – and Russia rejected it. That it is now likely happening might suggest some progress in peace talks, if only on the procedural front.
    


            The speech's tone – defiant against a part of Europe that has been Zelensky's key support base – was designed to appeal to the White House. Parts of it would have pleased both US Vice-President JD Vance and Trump himself. But it was also designed to use the embarrassment and vertigo of the Greenland crisis to urge sedentary European leaders into real action.
    


            Zelensky was complimentary about how Trump's snatching of Venezuela's former president Nicolas Maduro led to him facing trial in New York. But he reminded Europeans that Russia's President Vladimir Putin did not face a similar fate, and that the people of Iran had been left to face the brutality of their security forces. He danced around the issue of US weapons supplies, saying he had discussed air defenses with Trump, but that he had been advised not to mention the US Tomahawk missiles Ukraine urgently wants.
    


            Zelensky wanted to leave a mark on his European hosts that Trump would appreciate and convey the idea that the peace process has momentum, saying the documents were “almost ready.”
    


            The answer to the key question of whether Putin will sign up to them likely leans towards the negative.
    


            President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reached a verbal understanding about Greenland during their meeting yesterday, but no document has been produced yet memorializing a future deal, people familiar with their discussion told CNN.
    


            Trump and Rutte agreed to further discussions about updating a 1951 agreement between the US, Denmark and Greenland that governs the US military's presence on the island, the sources said. The deal framework also guarantees that Russia and China will be barred from any investments in Greenland and lays out an enhanced role for NATO in Greenland, they said.
    


            Two sources said another element of a possible deal is increased US access to Greenland's natural resources. Rutte on Thursday denied that he had discussed this issue with Trump directly.
    


            One person familiar with the discussions said Rutte did not want any formal documents prepared during his meeting with Trump because he was concerned they could leak — or be posted by Trump himself on social media. Trump earlier this week posted a private message Rutte sent to him ahead of their talks.
    


            The lack of any written documentation has caused some confusion among NATO allies about what was actually agreed upon.

            Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Globb urged European leaders to move forward in solidarity as they face the prospect of a new world order that shifts away from decades-long norms.
    


            Speaking to CNN's Becky Anderson, the statesman expressed his empathy for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying, “I understand rather well the frustration uttered by President Zelensky … I know the root cause for it, it's not a new thing.”
    


            The prime minister reflected positively on the bloc's recent response to US President Donald Trump's threat to raise tariffs on his NATO allies and annex Greenland from Denmark.
    


            “Europe is only strong when it's united,” he said, adding his approval of NATO's decision to hold out and defy Trump's demands. “In the last week, Europe finally showed some backbone,” he said.
    


            Globb joined British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, among much of Europe, in declining the US president's offer to sit on his newly founded “Board of Peace.” When asked about Trump's wish to have it  work with the United Nations, Globb said: “No mechanism can be … parallel to the United Nations.”
    


            And on the future of NATO, Slovenia's leader said that while the line demarking the organization's dissolution has not yet been crossed, recent events have brought the alliance “close to it.”
    


                    But the diplomat was optimistic about where NATO will go next: “We, the allies, are still in time to sit down, talk amongst each other honestly, sincerely, perhaps even loudly. But then find the joint and common way forward.”
                





            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed his Danish counterpart Mette Frederiksen to Chequers, his official country home outside London, today for a bilateral meeting, as Denmark faces continued pressure from the United States over Greenland.
    


            Frederiksen thanked Starmer for his support, calling Britain one of Denmark's “oldest and most important allies,” and stressed the importance of a strong alliance during what she described as a difficult period.
    


                    “Everybody recognizes that it has been quite a difficult time for us and to know that you have good friends, strong allies, and that Europeans stand together, don't get divided and stick to, as you said, our common values even in a world that is changing rapidly is extremely important for all of us,” Frederiksen said, adding: “We gotta get by with a little help from our friends.”
                





            Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark.
    


The latest from Trump on Greenland: President Donald Trump said earlier today that negotiations regarding Greenland currently give US “total access” for defense. “It's really being negotiated now, the details of it, but essentially it's total access. It's there's no end, there's no time limit,” Trump said in an interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo.
    


US President Donald Trump said he had a good meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Davos, Switzerland, today, but added that there's still “a ways to go” toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine.
    


            “The war has to end,” he said as he emerged from the meeting. “We hope it's going to end. There are a lot of people being killed.”
    


            “It's an ongoing process,” Trump added. “Everybody wants to have the war end.”
    


            Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the meeting was “positive,” adding that was “enough” to say about it.
    


            The Ukrainian president said the “last mile” of negotiations “is very difficult.”
    


            “During any dialogue, with any president, I have to defend the interests of my country. That's why the dialogue is maybe, it's not simple,” he said. “But it was today. It was positive.”
    


            Zelensky's comments came after his speech at the World Economic Forum, during which he called out European leaders on their inaction when it comes to the war in Ukraine, comparing it to their behavior surrounding Greenland in recent days.
    


CNN's Kaitlin Collins explains more about what we know so far:


President Trump has said that the Ukraine war 'has to end' after meeting with Ukrainian President Zelensky in a private bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. CNN's Kaitlan Collins reports.


            Vice President JD Vance said the United States will “keep on trying to make sure that we secure that land mass” as he addressed the negotiations about US access to Greenland on Thursday.
    


            Vance's comment came in response to a reporter's question about his understanding of the framework of a future deal over Greenland. While Vance did not answer that directly, he stressed US national security interests in the island.
    


            “We would need control over the Arctic in order to shoot that missile down. Our entire missile defense system defends depends on that arctic security,” Vance said while taking questions from reporters in Toledo, Ohio.
    


            Of the deal framework, Vance said the “negotiations with NATO are going fine.”
    


            “Documents aimed at ending this war” against Ukraine are “nearly ready,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Davos, Switzerland, after meeting with US President Donald Trump today.
    


            Both US and Ukrainian teams are working on ending the conflict “almost every day,” Zelensky said.
    


            “Ukraine is working with full honesty and determination, and that brings results, and Russia must become ready too to finish this war, to stop this aggression,” he added.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called out European leaders on their inaction when it comes to the war on Ukraine, comparing it to their behavior surrounding Greenland in recent days.
    


            “Everyone turned attention to Greenland, and it's clear most leaders simply are not sure what to do about it. And it seems like everyone is just waiting for America to cool down on this topic, hoping it will pass away. But what if it will not, what then?” Zelensky questioned.
    


                    “We have told our European partners multiple times — act now … but Europe still remains in ‘Greenland mode' — maybe someday, someone will do something,” the Ukrainian president said.
                





            “You either declare that European bases will protect the region from Russia and China and establish those bases, or you risk not being taken seriously,” Zelensky said about Greenland, echoing what US President Donald Trump has said about the security of the Arctic region. “Because 40 soldiers will not protect anything.”
    


            Zelensky warned of Russian warships “sailing freely around Greenland,” and he offered Urkaine's expertise and weapons “to ensure not one of those ships remains.”
    


            “They can sink near Greenland, just as they do near Crimea,” he added. “We can take actions and we know how to fight there, if we were asked, and if Ukraine were in NATO — but we are not.”
    


            Europe is a “beautiful but fragmented” kaleidoscope of “small and middle” powers, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said during his speech at Davos, as he criticized the bloc of “looking lost.”
    


                    “Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost trying to convince the US president to change, but he will not change,” he continued. 
                





            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Europe is too reliant on the US for its security, as he questioned the response from NATO if Russia was to invade another European nation.
    


            “Europe needs united armed forces, forces that can truly defend Europe today,” he said during his speech in Davos.
    


            “Europe relies only on that belief that if danger comes, NATO will act, but no one has really seen the alliance in action.”
    


            He questioned who would respond if Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to invade Lithuania or strike Poland.
    


            “Right now NATO exists thanks to the belief that the United States will act, that it will not stand aside and will help,” Zelensky said.
    


            “But what if it doesn't? Believe me, this question is everywhere in the minds of every European leader.”
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has criticized a lack of progress on establishing a special tribunal for Russian aggression at the International Criminal Court (ICC), as he said that “too often in Europe something else is more urgent than justice.”
    


                    “Europe loves to discuss the future, but avoids taking action today, action that defines what kind of future we will have,” he added. 
                





            Zelensky made the comments in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, shortly after having a closed-door meeting with US President Donald Trump.
    


            “There is still no real progress on establishing a special tribunal for Russian aggression against Ukraine, against the Ukrainian people,” Zelensky said.
    


            “Many meetings have taken place but still Europe hasn't reached even the point of having a home for the tribunal, with staff and actual work happening inside.”
    


            “What's missing, time or political will?”
    


            Zelensky did however add that he was “grateful” to be working with partners on security guarantees for Ukraine after the war ends.
    


            President Donald Trump appeared to indicate that diplomatic channels between the US and Iran would reopen during a speech at the World Economic Forum earlier today.
    


                    “Iran does want to talk, and we'll talk,” Trump said, without offering any more detail.
                





Remember: Earlier this month, tensions between the US and Iran rose once again following the Iranian regime's crackdown against anti-government demonstrations. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged that thousands of Iranians were killed in the unrest, deaths he blamed on Trump without mentioning the brutal tactics of Iran's security forces.
    


            The Trump administration had considered striking Iran in retaliation before Trump declared “very important sources on the other side” had informed him the killing had stopped — suggesting there was now no imminent threat of military action.
    


            Following his remarks today, Trump refused to answer Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo when she tried to press him on whether he would reconsider if there was another deadly crackdown in Iran.
    


            “I don't want to talk about that, because I don't want to put myself in a position,” he said. “I don't want to say it, because I think it would be stupid for me to say that.
    


            President Donald Trump today recognized that Republicans might have a tough midterm election this year, pointing to the fact that the party of the president usually loses in the midterms.
    


            “There's something psychological that if you're president, no matter how well you're doing, you don't do well in the midterms,” Trump told Fox Business in an interview from Davos, Switzerland, where the president attended the World Economic Forum.
    


                    “We should do well,” Trump added. “And we're going to fight like hell to do well.”
                





            With the threat of another government shutdown at the end of the month, Trump said the federal government is likely to shut down again and blamed Democrats.
    


                    “I think we have a problem,” Trump said. “I think we're probably end up in another Democrat shutdown.”
                





            Trump also said he would like to see a reconciliation package, but added that passing his budget could be hard given the thin GOP majority.
    


            “It's hard when you have a majority by three,” Trump said. He called out Republican Reps. Thomas Massie and Rand Paul who have previously broken with the party on major votes.
    


            President Donald Trump said today that the US will retaliate if European countries sell US stocks and bonds in response to the president's ambition of acquiring Greenland and his pressure campaign on NATO allies.
    


                    When asked if he is worried that European countries will sell the stocks and bonds they have in the US, Trump said, “If that would happen, there would be, you know, big retaliation on our part. 
                





            “We have all the cards,” the president added while speaking to Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo from Davos, Switzerland.
    


            On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Denmark — which maintains territorial control over Greenland — and its investment in the US are “irrelevant” after the European country's pension fund announced it would unwind its investment in US government bonds because of “poor government finances.”
    


            The $100 million makes up a very small portion of the $30.8 trillion US Treasury market but Denmark itself holds just under $10 billion worth of US bonds. That investment has been on the decline for several years – the country held just under $18 billion of US Treasuries as recently as 2021.
    


            President Donald Trump today touted US weapons as being the “best,” but urged defense companies to make them “faster.”
    


            “We have the best equipment in the world — the Patriots, Tomahawks, the F35s — all of our equipment is the best,” Trump told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo in an interview from Davos, Switzerland. “Other countries want it and we want it. We need more. It takes too long to get it.”
    


            He later added: “We have to make it faster.”
    


            Earlier this month, Trump threatened defense contracting companies, saying he would seek to limit stock buybacks and executive salaries unless they improve their delivery of weapons systems to the US military.
    


            President Donald Trump said today that he had a good meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but that there's still “a ways to go” toward ending its war with Russia.
    


            “The war has to end,” he said as he emerged from a meeting with Zelensky in Davos. “We hope it's going to end. There are a lot of people being killed.”
    


            Trump declined to detail the substance of the closed-door conversation with Ukraine's leader, though he told CNN's Kaitlan Collins that the two did not talk about his just-formed “Board of Peace.”
    


            Trump officials are due to meet next with Russian President Vladimir Putin as they aim to broker a ceasefire agreement.
    


            “It's an ongoing process,” Trump said. “Everybody wants to have the war end.”
    


            US President Donald Trump's “Board of Peace” signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland, has concluded, as talks about the future of Ukraine and Greenland remain ongoing.

            In 2015, China handed back something of great value to Ai Weiwei: his Chinese passport. The move allowed the dissident artist to travel for the first time since authorities revoked his document in 2011 – the same year he spent 81 days in secret government detention for alleged tax evasion. He moved to Berlin shortly after.
    


            For the past 10 years Ai has lived in Germany, the UK and now Portugal, never once setting foot in his native country, where people with far less controversial pasts have faced arbitrary detention. But in mid-December, he decided to take the risk, returning for a three-week visit.
    


            “It felt like a phone call that had been disconnected for 10 years suddenly reconnecting,” he said of the instant he arrived into Beijing. “The tone, rhythm and speed, all returned to how they were before.”
    


            Glimpses of the visit are on Ai's Instagram account, where the artist actively posts but doesn't typically write captions, contributing to the trip's under-the-radar quality. Varied scenes include a video of smokestacks in the unmistakable soft light of a Beijing winter, the artist puffing cigarettes as a Lazy Susan spins leisurely with dishes and a bottle of Nongfu Spring, a local mineral water brand; and a robot getting out of an elevator.
    


            Still images show the artist lifting dumbbells at an indoor gym and catching up with old friends – the ordinary becoming somewhat extraordinary when compared to how intensely he was surveilled by authorities when he was last in China's capital.
    


            Nostalgia permeates the images. “What I missed most was speaking Chinese,” he said. “For immigrants, the greatest loss is not wealth, loneliness or an unfamiliar lifestyle, but the loss of linguistic exchange.”  



            When Ai left in 2015, he was a thorn on the government's side. The outspoken artist and activist relentlessly criticized China on everything from alleged human rights abuses to censorship and corruption, with artworks such as “Remembering” (2009) – an installation commemorating the thousands of children killed under the collapse of shoddily-constructed school buildings during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake – gaining international attention. In “S.A.C.R.E.D,” he depicted what it was like to be imprisoned for nearly three months, in the form of six life-sized dioramas that debuted at the 2013 Venice Biennale.
    


            Such pieces came at a time when – in the years after the 2008 Beijing Olympics – officials carefully projected a new era of Chinese development and aggressively cracked down on any dissent. In the decade Ai has been away, China's censorship and surveillance efforts have only grown more sophisticated, with critics now fearing that artificial intelligence is turbocharging these systems of control.
    


            Ai had previously said he had no illusions about his chances of returning to China. But now his son is almost 17 years old, he no longer bears the same weight of parental responsibility – and feels “relatively freer” to act of his own accord.
    


            Poignant photos from the trip shared with CNN show the father and son walking out of Beijing Capital International Airport, as well as reuniting with Ai's 93-year-old mother.
    


            “When I saw my mother, she was smiling and especially happy to see my son. They held hands the entire time. She did not say much, but she was deeply content. That contentment was like a gentle wind on a hot day, or a few drops of rain during a drought – natural, humane happiness.
    


            “I am not familiar with this kind of feeling, and it surprised me,” he added.
    


            Ai didn't take any specific precautions when planning the trip but was “inspected and interrogated” for almost two hours at Beijing's airport before he was allowed to pass immigration. “The questions were very simple: How long do you plan to stay here? Where else do you plan to go?”
    


            The fact that rest of the 68-year-old's visit was “smooth and, one could say, pleasant” may signal authorities' confidence on a number of fronts: a Chinese public that is increasingly unfamiliar with the artist as his name and works have been largely censored on the country's social media platforms; and in the expansive reach of their surveillance technologies. Politically, there might also be little to gain from the international outcry that would arise were the high-profile artist detained or prevented from entering Beijing.
    


            The red lines in China, as always, are vague and fast-evolving. Another prominent Chinese artist, Gao Zhen, had relocated to New York but returned to China in June 2024 to visit family, only to be detained about a week before he planned to return to the US, for scathing sculptures of Mao he created over a decade ago.
    


            From Europe, Ai has continued to produce works that are critical of the state, such as the 2020 documentary “Coronation,” on China's initial handling of the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan, and “Cockroach,” a sympathetic take on the 2019 Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. But he has also gone to great lengths to make art of what's in front of him: the global refugee crisis and, more recently, the war in Ukraine.
    


            When asked if he thought the Chinese government's attitudes towards him had changed given his trouble-free stay, he said he didn't think any change began recently.
    


            “Rather, it comes from my long-term public work in expressing my views… Although a country or group may disagree with my positions, they at least recognize that I speak sincerely and not for personal gain.”
    


            He believes China is “in an upward phase,” pointing to individual wealth, national strength and personal freedoms, though discussing political topics remains taboo. “The overall trajectory is one of ascent, even though different problems emerge at different stages.”
    


            Western society, conversely, is in decline, he argued, in perhaps rare agreement with the frequent message from Chinese leaders. He added that changes he's seen over the past 10 years have “shocked” him. “It feels like a landslide burying the highways it once built. Values once celebrated now appear hollow and collapsed.

            “I have never truly left anywhere; the distance has simply grown longer,” Ai explained. He once said he felt that he belonged nowhere, a “stranger” everywhere he goes. But it's his Chinese passport that keeps him rooted.

            President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he reached a framework for a deal with NATO over the future of Greenland that will include rights to rare-earth minerals.
    


            “They're going to be involved in mineral rights, and so are we,” Trump said about NATO and the United States in an interview with CNBC after the initial announcement on Truth Social.
    


            He didn't specify any preliminary terms. But Greenland's untapped mineral wealth has helped land the island at the top of Trump's empire-building wish list.
    


Trump officials view Greenland's underground riches as a way to loosen China's stranglehold over the rare-earth metals that are critical for everything from fighter jets and lasers to electric vehicles and MRI scanners.
    


            Trump has downplayed Greenland's natural resources, including in his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Wednesday, when he said acquiring rare-earth minerals wasn't the reason America needed the territory.
    


            “Everyone talks about the minerals. There's so many,” Trump said. “There's no such thing as rare earth. There's rare processing. But there's so much rare earth. And to get to this rare earth, you got to go through hundreds of feet of ice. That's not the reason we need it. We need it for strategic national security and international security.”
    


            But hours later, Trump said the deal for Greenland included two parts: his “Golden Dome” missile defense concept and minerals. That tracks with what his former national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News in 2024, when Waltz said that the administration's focus on Greenland was “about critical minerals” and “natural resources.”



            The reality is that Denmark's ownership of Greenland is not what's stopping the United States from tapping the island's treasure trove. It's the punishing Arctic environment.
    


            Researchers say it would be extremely difficult and expensive to extract Greenland's minerals because many of the island's mineral deposits are located in remote areas above the Arctic Circle, where there is a mile-thick polar ice sheet and darkness reigns much of the year.
    


            Not only that, but Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark, lacks the infrastructure and manpower required to make this mining dream a reality.
    


            “The idea of turning Greenland into America's rare-earth factory is science fiction. It's just completely bonkers,” said Malte Humpert, founder and senior fellow at The Arctic Institute. “You might as well mine on the moon. In some respects, it's worse than the moon.”
    


            Despite its name, approximately 80% of Greenland is covered with ice. And mineral extraction — or just about anything — in the Arctic can be five to 10 times more expensive than doing it elsewhere on the planet.
    


            Trump's interest in Greenland is not new — nor is he the first US president to covet the island.
    


            For years, if not decades, officials in Greenland have courted foreign direct investment. People in Greenland say they already are open to business opportunities without any belligerence.
    


            Getting US businesses to take a chance on Greenland may be a fantasy, experts say.
    


            “If there was a ‘pot of gold' waiting at the end of the rainbow in Greenland, private businesses would have gone there already,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
    


            However, Funk Kirkegaard, who previously worked with the Danish Ministry of Defense, said it's just “very difficult” to make a business case for the very large upfront investment that would be required.
    


            It's possible Trump tries to provide financial incentives and guarantees to entice US companies to make those massive investments, similar to the guarantees that Big Oil is seeking to drill aggressively in Venezuela.
    


            “If given enough taxpayer dollars, private business would be willing to do almost anything,” Funk Kirkegaard said. “But is that a good foundation on which to purchase a territory? The answer is no in Greenland, just as it's no in Venezuela.”
    


            The climate crisis has caused melting ice and rapidly rising temperatures in the Arctic, leading some to hope for new economic opportunities.
    


            However, it's too early to say this will be enough of a game-changer to overcome the environmental challenges of mining in Greenland. While ice melt has opened up some shipping routes, it has also made the ground less stable to drill and raises the risk of landslides.
    


            “Climate change doesn't mean it's easy. This is not the Mediterranean or your bathtub. There's just less ice freeze,” said Humpert of The Arctic Institute.
    


            Relatedly, Greenland's stringent environmental regulations would add expense and difficulty to widespread mining.
    


            Of course, those regulations reflect the local population's desire to keep the environment pristine. If the Trump administration somehow made those regulations disappear, it might prove deeply unpopular.
    


            “You could end up having a hostile local political situation,” Funk Kirkegaard said.
    


            Adam Lajeunesse, chair in Canadian and Arctic policy at St. Francis Xavier University, said Trump's “bizarre rhetoric” about taking over Greenland risks undermining the economic and strategic objectives US officials by harming the relationship with Greenland and Denmark.
    


            “You could see the United States no longer viewed as a friend and partner but as a bully that should be resisted,” he said.
    


            To some extent, this may already be happening.
    


            Christian Keldsen, managing director of the Greenland Business Association, cautions US officials risk damaging the relationship with the local population.
    


            “At the moment, everything American is a red flag,” he said. “Everyone is wondering, ‘Am I supporting someone taking over my country?'”

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Denmark's prime minister insisted that her country can't negotiate on its sovereignty and Greenland's leader said Thursday it's a “red line” after U.S. President Donald Trump said he agreed on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security with the head of NATO.

Much about the potential deal remained unclear, though Trump said in a Fox Business interview that “we're going to have total access to Greenland.” He added that “we're going to have all the military access we want.”

Trump on Wednesday abruptly scrapped the tariffs he had threatened to impose on eight European nations to press for U.S. control over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. It was a dramatic reversal hours after he insisted he wanted to get the island “including right, title and ownership” — though he also said he would not use force.

Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen voiced guarded relief, but he said he knew no concrete details of the agreement Trump cited. 

“‘I don't know what there is in the agreement, or the deal about my country,” he told reporters.

Trump said the deal, if completed, will also allow the United States to install an element of his “Golden Dome,” part of a multibillion dollar missile defense system, in Greenland.




Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said security in the Arctic is a matter for all of NATO, and it is “good and natural” that it be discussed between the U.S. president and Rutte. She said in a statement that she had spoken with Rutte “on an ongoing basis,” including before and after he met Trump in Davos.

She wrote that “we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty” and added: “I have been informed that this has not been the case.” 

Frederiksen said that Denmark wants to continue engaging in constructive dialogue with allies on how to strengthen security in the Arctic, including the Golden Dome program, “provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity.” Danish officials noted that NATO doesn't have a mandate to negotiate a deal on behalf of Denmark and Greenland.

Denmark has said the U.S., which already has a military presence in Greenland, can boost its bases there. The U.S. is already party to a 1951 treaty that gives it broad rights to set up military bases there with the consent of Denmark and Greenland.

NATO spokesperson Allison Hart said the alliance's secretary general, Mark Rutte, “did not propose any compromise to sovereignty during his meeting with President Trump.” She said that negotiations between Denmark, Greenland and the U.S. “will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold - economically or militarily - in Greenland.”

Nielsen, Greenland's leader, said Rutte had delivered the message that Greenland is willing to do more and host a NATO mission.

“Until yesterday, we couldn't rule out anything,” he told reporters in the island's capital, Nuuk. “Respectful dialogue through the right channels is what we have been seeking from the get-go, and I also feel that's the intention now from the other parties, and I'm happy for that.” 

He pointed to a working group that the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers agreed with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to set up last week, before Trump threatened tariffs. Denmark and the White House at the time offered diverging public views on its purpose.

Asked whether U.S. sovereignty over small pockets of Greenland might be a possibility, Nielsen said that “we are ready to negotiate a better partnership and so on, but sovereignty is a red line.” 

On the streets of Copenhagen, some were skeptical about Trump's switch.

“I think the man has said many things and done a lot of different things to what he says,” said Louise Pedersen, 22, who works with a startup company. “I have a hard time believing it. I think it's terrifying that we stand here in 2026.”

She said it's for Greenlanders to decide what happens with their land — “not Donald Trump.”

“I don't really trust anything Mr. Trump is saying,” said Poul Bjoern Strand, 70, who works in advertising.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, one of the European countries that had faced Trump's threat of tariffs over Greenland, underlined the need for European NATO allies to do more to secure the Arctic region and stressed that it is “a common trans-Atlantic interest.” 

“We will protect Denmark, Greenland, the north from the threat posed by Russia,” he said at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. “We will uphold the principles on which the trans-Atlantic partnership is founded, namely sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

“We support talks between Denmark, Greenland (and) the United States on the basis of these principles,” aiming for closer cooperation, Merz said. “It is good news that we are making steps into that right direction. I welcome President Trump's remarks from last night — this is the right way to go.” 

Frederiksen traveled to the United Kingdom on Thursday for talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said the “hard yards” of bolstering Arctic security can begin and credited Trump's “pragmatism” for withdrawing his tariff threats.

With many Americans still recovering from repeated snowstorms and bitter cold in the North, a new weekend storm could glaze roads, trees and power lines with damaging ice across much of the South.

ATLANTA (AP) — Millions of Americans from New Mexico to the Carolinas are bracing for a potentially catastrophic ice storm that could crush trees and power lines and knock out power for days, while Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Boston could see enough snow to make travel very difficult or nearly impossible, forecasters say.

An estimated 123 million people were under Winter Storm Watches on Thursday, most of them in southern or northeastern states, the National Weather Service said. Another 27 million Americans faced Extreme Cold Warnings in all of Minnesota and Wisconsin; and parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and Michigan.

The storm, expected to begin Friday and continue through the weekend, is also projected to bring heavy snow and all types of wintry precipitation, including freezing rain and sleet. An atmospheric river of moisture could be in place by the weekend, pulling precipitation across Texas and other states along the Gulf Coast and continuing across Georgia and the Carolinas before heading northeast, forecasters said.




“Snow amounts could reach a foot or more in the I-95 major cities from D.C. to Boston,” said weather service forecasters on the East Coast, who are increasingly confident the storm will strike the big cities.

In Washington, D.C., “the combination of heavy snow and ice alongside prolonged very cold temperatures presents a unique and significant risk to life and property across virtually the entire region,” forecasters said in the weather service's Washington/Baltimore office warned.

Here's a look at the approaching storm and how people are preparing for it, by the numbers:




The number of snowplows owned by the city of Jackson, Mississippi, where a mix of ice and sleet is possible this weekend. The city uses other heavy machinery like skid steers and small excavators to clear roads, said James Caldwell, deputy director of public works. Jackson also has three trucks that carry salt and sand to spread across roads before freezing weather.

The amount of ice — half an inch, or 1.27 centimeters — that can lead to a crippling ice storm, toppling trees and power lines to create widespread and long-lasting power outages. The latest forecasts from the weather service warn of the potential for a half-inch of ice or more for many areas, including parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Tennessee.

The number of Nashville snowplows named after country music legend and Tennessee native Dolly Parton (Dolly Plowton). Another snowplow in East Tennessee was named Snowlene after her classic hit song “Jolene” as part of a 2022 naming contest.

The number of layers needed to keep warm in extreme cold. AP video journalist Mark Vancleave in Minnesota explains the benefits of all three — a base layer, a middle layer and an outer shell — in this video.

The number of major U.S. hub airports in the path of the southern storm this weekend, when ice, sleet and snow could delay passengers and cargo: Dallas-Fort Worth; Atlanta; Memphis, Tennessee, and Charlotte, North Carolina. Still more major airports on the East Coast could see delays later, as the storm barrels east.

The number of inches of snow that could fall in parts of Oklahoma.

“You've got to be very weather aware, and real smart about what you're doing,” said Charles Daniel, who drives a semitrailer across western Oklahoma.

“One mistake can literally kill somebody, so you have to use your head,” he added.

The number of snow and ice removal trucks operated by Memphis, Tennessee's Division of Public Works. The city also has six trucks that spread brine, a mixture designed to melt wintry precipitation. Statewide, the Tennessee Department of Transportation has 851 salt trucks and 634 brine trucks, and most of the salt trucks double as plows.

Parts of at least 19 states in the storm's path were under winter storm watches by late Wednesday, with more watches and warnings expected as the system approaches. They include Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia. An estimated 55 million people are included in these winter storm watches, the weather service said.

The degree in Fahrenheit when water freezes, equivalent to 0 Celsius. This is a magic number when it comes to winter weather, said Eric Guillot, a scientist at the weather service. If the temperature is slightly above 32, it will be mostly liquid. But the colder it is below the mark, the more efficiently precipitation will freeze.

The number of snowplow trucks at the ready in Nashville, Tennessee, according to the Nashville Department of Transportation and Multimodal Infrastructure.

The windchill value — how cold it feels to a person when winds are factored in — that is expected in parts of the Northern Plains, the weather service projects. That equates to minus 45.6 Celsius and is forecast for parts of northern Minnesota and North Dakota.

“When the weather forecast says, ‘feels like negative 34,' it's just a matter of covering skin and being prepared for it,” said Nils Anderson, who owns Duluth Gear Exchange, an outdoor equipment store in Duluth, Minnesota.

The number of snowplows in the city of Chicago, where annual snowfall averages 37 to 39 inches (0.94 to 0.99 meters). The city also has 40 4x4 vehicles, and about 12 beet juice-dispensing trucks, according to Cole Stallard, Chicago's commissioner of Streets and Sanitation. The natural sugars of beet juice lower the freezing point of water, allowing salt mixtures to work at much lower temperatures and preventing refreezing, while also helping salt stick to the road longer.

The number of miles added last year to snowplow routes in Nashville, Tennessee. That was done “to get deeper into our neighborhoods — roads that had never been plowed before,” said Alex Apple, a spokesperson for Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell.

Texas has this number of pieces of winter weather equipment, including snowplows, motor graders and brine tankers, Texas Department of Transportation spokesperson Adam Hammons said. He said the agency also works with state partners and contractors to get more equipment when needed. In the Dallas area, “right now our main focus is treating our roadways in advance of the storm,” agency spokesperson Tony Hartzel said Wednesday.

The number of cubic yards of salt on hand at the Arkansas Department of Transportation. The state has 121 salt houses around the Arkansas, plus 600 salt spreaders and 700 snowplows, said Dave Parker, an agency spokesperson.

After back-to-back fatal train crashes sent shockwaves through Spain, some good news arrived Thursday: Boro, the missing dog, was found.

MADRID (AP) — After back-to-back fatal train crashes sent shock waves through Spain, some good news arrived on Thursday: Boro, the missing dog, was found.

Days earlier, Boro's owner Ana García issued a desperate plea to help find him after the dog bolted Sunday in the aftermath of the high-speed train crash in southern Spain that killed at least 45 people. García, 26, and her pregnant sister were traveling with Boro on the train that derailed.

On Thursday, forest firefighters in southern Spain found the black-and-white pooch, and posted images that showed García with one of her legs in a brace embracing Boro. Sitting inside a car, she spoke to reporters.

“Many thanks to all of Spain and everyone who has got involved so much,” she said. “It gave me great hope and we've done it.” 

The search for Boro appeared to provide Spaniards something to hope for amid the week's tragedy, and ultimately something to celebrate.

For days, people had rallied online to find him, amplifying García's call by sharing video of an interview she had given to local media. Photos of Boro, a medium-sized black dog with white eyebrows, went viral alongside phone numbers for García and her family. Spanish television broadcasters and newspapers covered the search.

García, her sister and the dog had been traveling Sunday by high-speed train from Malaga, their hometown in southern Spain, to the capital Madrid, when the tail of their train car jumped the rails for reasons that remain unclear, and smashed into another train.

The collision killed dozens and injured more than 150 people. Rescue crews helped García and her sister out of the tilted train car. That's when she briefly saw Boro before he ran. She spoke to the cameras with a blanket draped over her shoulders and a bandage on her cheek after Spain's worst rail accident in more than a decade.

“Please, if you can help, look for the animals,” a limping García told reporters at the time, choked up and holding back tears. “We were coming back from a family weekend with the little dog, who's family, too.” 

On Thursday, she had a bruise beneath her eye but, with Boro back by her side, also a smile plastered across her face.

“Now we have him and we have him for all our life,” García told reporters. “Now let's go home, buddy.”

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — An 18-year-old pleaded guilty Wednesday to murder and other charges for a mass shooting in North Carolina, acknowledging that he carried out a 2022 killing rampage that left five people dead, including his older brother and a police officer. 

Austin David Thompson, who was 15 at the time of the attack that authorities say began in his Raleigh neighborhood, had been poised to go on trial in state court in less than two weeks. 

Instead, Thompson's attorneys, who for months had filed pretrial motions designed to limit certain testimony and evidence, announced Tuesday that he planned to plead guilty to all charges against him. His attorneys wrote that avoiding a trial would “save the community and the victims from as much additional infliction of trauma as possible.”

Thompson, wearing a quarter-zip sweater and slacks, offered few words while Wake County Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway questioned him and accepted his pleas. He pleaded guilty to five counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon and one count of assault of an officer with a gun. 

Ridgeway set a sentencing hearing for Feb. 2, which could last several days as testimony and evidence are reviewed. Thompson and his attorney acknowledged in court that no plea agreement had been reached with local prosecutors. 

Because of his age at the time of the attack, Thompson can't receive the death penalty. A judge can issue sentences of life in prison without parole on such murder counts. Ridgeway instead could sentence him in the case so he could be eligible for parole after at least 25 years. State appeals judges recently placed a 40-year limit on how long such young offenders must serve before becoming eligible for parole.

Resolution in the case was delayed in part while Thompson recovered from a gunshot wound that Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman concluded earlier was self-inflicted before his arrest. His attorneys say it resulted in a serious brain injury. 




Providing the court a summary of evidence that would have been used at trial, Assistant District Attorney Patrick Latour described the sequence of events during the Oct. 13, 2022, shootings. He said Thompson first shot then repeatedly stabbed his brother James, whose body was found in the family's home in the Hedingham community. 

Latour said Thompson, armed with a shotgun and handgun, next shot multiple neighbors on the community's streets, killing Nicole Connors, 52, and then off-duty Raleigh police Officer Gabriel Torres, 29. Another neighbor who was wounded survived. Later, Thompson fatally shot two others on a nearby greenway trail: Mary Marshall, 34, and Susan Karnatz, 49. 

Dressed in camouflage and carrying a backpack, Thompson was located by law enforcement in a shed nearby and arrested after an hourslong standoff during which he wounded another police officer, Latour said.

Wednesday's hearing provided little additional explanation about Austin's motive. His attorneys wrote this week that the brain injury “has made it such that Austin cannot explain why he committed this shooting.” 

Latour said a note written by Thompson acknowledged why he killed his brother but that information wasn't provided Wednesday. The note was ordered to remain confidential for now. Latour also said records showing Thompson's online search history revealed that he had sought information on mass shootings and related items. A Thompson attorney said the report with those records may be challenged at sentencing.

Robert Steele, Marshall's fiance at the time of her death, told reporters after the hearing that sentencing Thompson to life in prison without parole is the right thing to do. 

“That's justice,” Steele said. “He took five people's lives, he tried to take two others.” 

In 2024, Thompson's father pleaded guilty to improperly storing his handgun that authorities said was found when his son was arrested. He received a suspended sentence and probation.

Investigators seized 11 firearms and 160 boxes of ammunition — some of them empty — from the Thompson home, according to search warrants. Austin Thompson and his family were avid hunters, Latour said.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Maine became the latest target of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown, while a federal appeals court on Wednesday suspended a decision that prohibited federal officers from using tear gas or pepper spray against peaceful protesters in Minnesota.

The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was persuaded to freeze a judge's ruling that bars retaliation against the public in Minnesota, including detaining people who follow agents in cars, while the government pursues an appeal. Operation Metro Surge, an immigration enforcement operation in the Twin Cities, has been underway for weeks.

Attorney General Pam Bondi praised the appeals court on X, saying the Justice Department “will protect federal law enforcement agents from criminals in the streets AND activist judges in the courtroom.”

After the stay was issued, Greg Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol, who has commanded the administration's big-city immigration campaign, was seen on video repeatedly warning protesters on a snowy Minneapolis street “Gas is coming!” before tossing a canister into the crowd that released green smoke.




Minnesota is a major focus of immigration sweeps by agencies under the Department of Homeland Security and is where Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE officer on Jan. 7. State and local officials who oppose the campaign were served with federal grand jury subpoenas Tuesday for records that might suggest they were trying to stifle enforcement.

A political action committee founded by former Vice President Kamala Harris urged donors to contribute to a defense fund in aid of Gov. Tim Walz, her 2024 running mate.

“The Justice Department is going after Trump's enemies,” Harris' email said, referring to President Donald Trump.

In Maine, the Department of Homeland Security named the enforcement operation Catch of the Day in an apparent play on the state's seafood industry. Maine has relatively few residents who are in the United States illegally but has a notable presence of refugees in its largest cities, particularly from Africa. 

Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, said she won't grant a request for confidential license plates sought by Customs and Border Protection, a decision that reflects her disgust over “abuses of power” by immigration enforcers. 

“We have not revoked existing plates but have paused issuance of new plates. We want to be assured that Maine plates will not be used for lawless purposes,” Bellows said.

A message seeking comment from CBP was not immediately returned.

Portland City Council member Pious Ali, a native of Ghana, said there's much anxiety about ICE's presence in Maine's largest city.

“There are immigrants who live here who work in our hospitals, they work in our schools, they work in our hotels, they are part of the economic engine of our community,” Ali said.



Bovino said more than 10,000 people in the U.S. illegally have been arrested in Minnesota in the past year, including 3,000 “of some of the most dangerous offenders” in the last six weeks during Operation Metro Surge.

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government's arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate. 

Separately, a federal judge said he's prepared to grant bond and release two men after hearing conflicting testimony about an alleged assault on an immigration officer. Prosecutors are appealing. One of the men was shot in the thigh by the officer during the encounter last week.

The officer said he was repeatedly struck with a broom and with snow shovels while trying to subdue and arrest Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna following a car crash and foot chase.

Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis denied assaulting the officer. Neither video evidence nor three eyewitnesses supported the officer's account about the broom and shovels or that there had been a third person involved.

Aljorna and Sosa-Celis do not have violent criminal records, their attorneys said, and both had been working as DoorDash drivers at night to avoid encounters with federal agents.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko said they still could be detained by ICE even if released from custody in the assault case.



The Minneapolis and Saint Paul city councils are pushing for Walz to implement a pause on evictions across the state so families can shelter in place safely.

“No worker should have to choose between keeping a roof over their head and risking being kidnapped by ICE on the way to work,” Minneapolis City Council Minority Leader Robin Wonsley said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the grassroots Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee called for the arrest of the officer who shot Good. 

“We need our mayor, we need our elected officials to stand up to this violence,” MIRAC spokesperson Erika Zurawski said at a news conference Wednesday. “On the federal level, we mean to make sure none of our U.S. representatives vote for any more funding for ICE.”

Good was in her vehicle blocking a Minneapolis street where ICE officers were operating. Trump administration officials say the officer shot her in self-defense, although videos of the encounter show the Honda Pilot slowly turning away from him.

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) — A former Uvalde schools police officer was acquitted Wednesday of charges that he failed in his duties to confront the gunman at Robb Elementary during the critical first minutes of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.

Jurors deliberated for more than seven hours before finding Adrian Gonzales, 52, not guilty in the first trial over the hesitant law enforcement response to the 2022 attack, in which a teenage gunman killed 19 fourth-graders and two teachers. Had he been convicted, he faced up two years in prison on more than two dozen charges of child abandonment and endangerment.

Gonzales appeared to fight back tears and hugged his lawyers after the verdict was read in a courtroom in Corpus Christi, hundreds of miles from Uvalde, where his legal team said a fair trial would not have been possible. 

“Thank you for the jury for considering all the evidence,” Gonzales told reporters. Asked if he wanted to say anything to the families, he declined.

Several family members of the victims sat in silence in the courtroom, some crying or wiping away tears.

“Faith is fractured, but you never lose faith,” said Jesse Rizo, whose 9-year-old niece Jackie Cazares was killed. He said he was frustrated by the verdict and hopes the state will press ahead with the trial of former Uvalde schools Police Chief Pete Arredondo, the only other officer who has been charged over the police response.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




“Those children in the cemetery can't speak for themselves,” Rizo said.




Jurors declined to speak to reporters while leaving.

Arredondo's trial has not yet been set. Paul Looney, his attorney, told The Associated Press that he believes the verdict will result in prosecutors dropping the case against his client. 

“These people have been vilified, and it's horrible what's been done to them. These guys didn't do anything wrong,” Looney said.

The nearly three-week trial was an unusual case in the U.S. of an officer facing criminal charges on accusations of failing to stop a crime and protect lives.

The proceedings included emotional testimony from teachers who were shot and survived. Prosecutors argued that Gonzales abandoned his training and did nothing to stop or interrupt the teenage gunman before he entered the school.

“We're expected to act differently when talking about a child that can't defend themselves,” special prosecutor Bill Turner said during closing arguments Wednesday. “If you have a duty to act, you can't stand by while a child is in imminent danger.”

At least 370 law enforcement officers rushed to the school, where 77 minutes passed before a tactical team finally entered the classroom to confront and kill the gunman. Gonzales was one of just two officers indicted, angering some victim's relatives who said they wanted more to be held accountable.

Gonzales was charged with 29 counts of child abandonment and endangerment — each count representing the 19 students who were killed and 10 others who were injured.

During the trial jurors heard a medical examiner describe the fatal wounds to the children, some of whom were shot more than a dozen times. Several parents told of sending their children to school for an awards ceremony and the panic that ensued as the attack unfolded.

Gonzales' lawyers said he arrived upon a chaotic scene of rifle shots echoing on school grounds and never saw the gunman before the attacker went inside the school. They also insisted that three other officers who arrived seconds later had a better chance to stop the gunman.

“He was the lowest man on the totem pole. They thought he was easy pickings,” Nico LaHood, one of Gonzales' attorneys, said of prosecutors after the acquittal.

LaHood said he briefly polled jurors on their decision after the verdict.

“They talked about gaps. They talked about perspective and what the government didn't prove about Adrian,” LaHood said. 

Some victims' families made the long drive to watch Gonzales' trial. Early on the sister of one of the teachers killed was removed from the courtroom after an angry outburst following one officer's testimony.

Gonzales' trial was tightly focused on his actions in the early moments of the attack, but prosecutors also presented the graphic and emotional testimony as the result of police failures.

State and federal reviews of the shooting cited cascading problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and technology, and questioned why officers waited so long.

Looney, Arredondo's attorney, said he still wants his client to go trial so he can clear his name, saying, “Pete Arredondo deserves and needs a complete airing and public vindication. I hope he gets that chance.” 

Prosecutors faced a high bar to win a conviction. Juries are often reluctant to convict law enforcement officers for inaction, as seen after the 2018 school massacre in Parkland, Florida. A sheriff's deputy was acquitted after being charged with failing to confront the shooter in that attack — the first such prosecution in the U.S. for an on-campus shooting.

The man accused of killing a 52-year-old during a shooting at a Phoenix gas station previously faced a weapons-related charge, court records show.

Deondre Stephon Franklin, 25, was charged in 2020 with carrying a deadly weapon while under the age of 21, along with an underage alcohol offense, according to Peoria Municipal Court records.

The case was later dismissed by prosecutors after Franklin complied with court-ordered conditions, including substance evaluation and education, records show. The case did not result in a conviction.

Franklin is now accused in a fatal shooting that police say unfolded during a routine morning stop at a QuikTrip gas station.

Phoenix Police said 52-year-old Danny Lyn Kaster was shot and killed during a morning shooting at a QuikTrip in Phoenix on Jan. 16. Officers responded to reports of gunfire around 7:45 a.m. and found Kaster suffering from at least one gunshot wound.

Phoenix Fire Department crews transported Kaster to a hospital, where he later died from his injuries, police said.

Homicide detectives launched an investigation and were able to identify Franklin as the suspect. One day after the shooting, Franklin was arrested and booked on one count of murder, according to Phoenix Police Public Affairs Sgt. Rob Scherer.

He is being held on a $1 million bond and is scheduled to return to court on Jan. 23, records show. The investigation remains active.

Authorities have not released details about a possible motive or whether the two men knew each other prior to the encounter.

Kaster's family told FOX 10 Phoenix the shooting stemmed from what they described as a seemingly ordinary interaction inside the gas station.

According to family members, Kaster was waiting in line to use the bathroom when Franklin allegedly attempted to cut in front of him. When Kaster intervened, the family said, Franklin shot him.

""He was killed in the most ordinary interaction,"" family members told the station, adding that ""it could have been anyone.""

Kaster was taken to the hospital following the shooting but died shortly afterward, his family said.

Loved ones told FOX 10 Phoenix they now want the world to know who Kaster was beyond the circumstances of his death, describing him as a special person whose life was taken far too soon.

Police have not said whether surveillance video captured the shooting or whether a weapon has been recovered.

Chief medical officer for Dry January USA Dr. Michael Caldwell discusses the health benefits of abstaining from alcohol on ‘Fox & Friends.' 

Happy hour used to be a reliable business driver for bars and restaurants. 

Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, that reliability has faded.

Remote work, altered schedules and changing social habits have disrupted the traditional post-work drinking rush, forcing establishments to adapt — and raising questions about whether happy hour is disappearing altogether or simply evolving.

BARTENDERS REVEAL WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DRINK WHEN THEY'RE OFF DUTY: 'TRULY GREAT SHOT'

Fox News Digital spoke with a bar owner and a behavioral health specialist to learn more.

Here's what the experts said.

Happy hour crowds look different these days as remote work reshapes when, and whether, co-workers gather after hours. (iStock)

Happy hours haven't disappeared, but they've become fragmented, said Robert Mahon, owner of Mahon Hospitality in New York and Dublin. 

""We are now seeing where the dust has settled across Manhattan,"" Mahon said.

""Certain pockets have recovered [from the pandemic] far better than others, largely due to ongoing work-from-home dynamics.""

HAPPY HOUR BANNED? 7 US STATES STILL OUTLAW AFTER-WORK DRINK SPECIALS

Mahon said that in the Big Apple, workers have largely returned to the areas around Penn Station and Grand Central, and his bars in those areas are still seeing a traditional 5-7 p.m. bar rush on Tuesdays through Thursdays.

""By contrast, areas such as Midtown East and the Financial District, which still hold a large volume of office inventory, have experienced significant bar and restaurant closures along their main corridors,"" he said. 

In some Manhattan neighborhoods, happy hour traffic has returned — while nearby business districts remain quiet. (iStock)

""Traditionally, Thursday was our strongest corporate happy hour night pre-pandemic. This has now shifted to Wednesday, as many companies continue to accommodate remote work on Fridays.""

He added that he's seen ""a clear divergence by age group,"" with younger drinkers being far more driven by deals — even if they have to travel for it.

TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ

""While there is a lot of media commentary about younger people drinking less, our experience is the opposite,"" Mahon said.

""They are drinking, but they want new, trendy venues that align with their lifestyle and social identity. ... In contrast, the 35-plus demographic tends to prioritize convenience, opting for their nearest bar to the office or somewhere along their commute home.""

""Many people feel emotionally spent by the end of the workday and see happy hour less as a release and more as another obligation.""

Mahon also recalled something that his father once told him: If you have a good burger and cold beer, customers will come.

""That still holds true, but the game has changed,"" he said.

""Today, customers expect great food and drink as a baseline, but they also want a memorable experience.""

The decline in happy hour attendance can be seen in remote and in-person workers alike, said Jonathan Alpert, a psychotherapist based in New York City. 

""Remote and hybrid workers feel it the most because there's less natural transition from office to social time,"" he said. ""When people are already home, the motivation to go back out drops significantly.""

Younger professionals in finance, tech and consulting are rethinking how they unwind at the end of long days. (iStock)

Alpert added that he sees this shift ""among younger professionals in their 20s and 30s, especially in high-pressure industries like finance, tech and consulting.""

The decline in post-work socializing, he added, isn't just due to after-work stress, though that's a major factor.

""Higher prices make people think twice, but the bigger driver is burnout,"" Alpert said. 

""Many people feel emotionally spent by the end of the workday and see happy hour less as a release and more as another obligation.""

Behavioral health experts say many workers feel emotionally drained by day's end, making happy hour less appealing. (iStock)

That said, Alpert doesn't think after-work happy hours are disappearing into the ether.

They're just ""no longer automatic,"" he said.

""People seem to be shifting toward smaller, more intentional plans like weekend meetups, fitness classes or low-key dinners rather than spontaneous drinks after work,"" he observed.

Fox News Digital spoke with Ari Lightman, a digital media and marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University, on Casey Anthony's latest venture on Substack.

Casey Anthony, often referred to as ""America's most hated mom,"" is again weighing in on national politics, this time accusing the United States of systemic racism and sexism and claiming that White men are falsely portrayed as victims of discrimination.

In a recent Substack post, Anthony argued that America has a ""long-standing history of discriminating against anyone who is not a white man,"" citing slavery, voting rights, segregation, and civil rights legislation as evidence of what she described as entrenched inequality.

""Our country has a long-standing history of discriminating against anyone who is not a white man,"" she wrote in a Tuesday Substack post.

Anthony referenced the ratification of the 13th and 15th Amendments, the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the creation of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, arguing that such measures were necessary to correct historical discrimination, not to punish White men.

""The entire purpose of DEI is to ‘hire without regard to race, religion, and national origin' and to ‘take affirmative action' to ensure equal treatment,"" Anthony wrote, adding that claims White men are being penalized are ""laughable and disgusting.""

She went on to criticize Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, accusing the state of attempting to roll back anti-discrimination policies and alleging that government leaders are prioritizing the protection of White men ""at all costs.""

Anthony claimed White men are the only demographic group in the U.S. that has ""never been marginalized"" or faced systemic barriers to employment, healthcare or civil rights.

In a reply to Anthony's post, Uthmeier's deputy chief of staff, Jeremy Redfern, wrote on X: ""If only Caylee was alive to see @AGJamesUthmeier fight for a true merit-based system free from discrimination, but she was denied that opportunity.""

In an opinion issued this week, Uthmeier concluded that Florida laws requiring race-based state action are unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment.

The comments follow Anthony's recent criticism of federal authorities over the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, in which she accused the Trump administration and Vice President JD Vance of shielding federal agents from accountability.

""There is no such thing as a federal law-enforcement officer having immunity because it is convenient for you and this Administration,"" Anthony wrote. ""This applies to your Gestapo agents in ICE.""

Anthony, now 38, was acquitted in 2011 in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. A jury found her guilty of lying to law enforcement but not guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter or aggravated child abuse. Caylee's death remains unsolved.

Anthony has increasingly used her Substack platform to comment on law enforcement, civil rights and political issues.

American tennis star Amanda Anisimova dismissed a tennis reporter's question about how it felt to play in the U.S. with ""everything that's been happening.""

Anisimova was among the American players who received a similar question at the Australian Open this week. First, she was asked how it felt to ""play under the American flag right now.""

""I was born in America. So, I'm always proud to represent my country,"" the New Jersey native said. ""A lot of us are doing really well, and it's great to see a lot of great athletes on the women's side and men's side. I feel like we're all doing a great job representing ourselves.""

The reporter later tried to clarify the question, asking ""in the context of the last year of everything that's been happening in the U.S., does that complicate that feeling at all?""

""I don't think that's relevant,"" she fired back.

Anisimova's answer was a stark contrast from what Coco Gauff said during the tournament earlier this week.

Gauff was asked about her thoughts on the ""state of the U.S."" one year into President Donald Trump's second term.

""I hope forward that we can have a lot more peace in our country and more kindness in the way we speak to each other about different topics and things like that,"" she said, via The Tennis Letter. ""Obviously, I've been pretty vocal about how I felt. At this point, I feel a bit fatigued talking about it just because of the fact that it is hard also being a Black woman in this country and having to experience things, even online, and seeing marginalized communities being affected. And knowing that I can only donate and speak out. I try my best to do that.

Joel Klatt and Colin Cowherd discuss the importance of Indiana winning the National Championship, and whether or not Miami can rebound following their loss. 

Indiana star quarterback Fernando Mendoza is not only a star on the field, but on LinkedIn, too.

LinkedIn is a professional networking platform that connects people for career development, job seeking, and recruiting. Mendoza posted on the platform what winning a College Football Playoff National Championship taught him about business-to-business sales.

""Here's what winning a National Championship taught me about business-to-business sales (kidding … kinda),"" Mendoza posted on LinkedIn.

""1. Believe in yourself: Four years ago, I was a two-star recruit playing high school football 30 minutes from Hard Rock Stadium with a dream of playing at the highest level. Two days ago, I became a National Champion in that same stadium, surrounded by the family who never stopped believing in me,"" Mendoza wrote.

""2. Take the risk: When it's fourth-and-5 at the 12-yard line, go for it. 3. Remember who got you there: Thank you to my teammates, coaches, support staff, professors, and everyone behind the scenes who helped make this happen.""

Mendoza has been thrust into the national spotlight this season. The 22-year-old won the Heisman Trophy and led the team to an undefeated season.

Mendoza, after a season in which he completed 72% of his passes for 3,535 yards, with 41 touchdowns and six interceptions, has positioned himself to be the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Las Vegas Raiders currently hold the No. 1 overall pick and need a franchise quarterback.

Maybe Mendoza will have another LinkedIn update about business-to-business sales if he does indeed get selected by the Raiders with the top pick in the draft.

Tennis stars Naomi Osaka and Sorana Cirstea had a tiff at the end of their Australian Open match on Thursday.

Osaka brought Cirstea's final Aussie Open match to a bitter end when she defeated the Romanian player 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. Cirstea had words for Osaka as she greeted her at the net for the post-match handshake.

She slapped Osaka's hand and then marched toward the umpire. Osaka asked, ""What was that for?""

Cirstea didn't appear to enjoy Osaka trying to hype herself up during the match.

""Apparently a lot of ‘C'mons' that she was angry about but whatever,"" Osaka said in the interview after the match. ""I mean, I tried to play well, I tried my best. She's a great player — I think this was her last Australian Open so, OK, sorry she was mad about it.""

Osaka added that Cirstea could have asked her to stop.

Osaka entered the tournament as the No. 16 seed. She's won the Australian Open twice in her career but hasn't made it past the third round since 2021. She is set for a third-round matchup against Maddison Inglis on Friday.

Cirstea announced in December that the 2026 season would be her final run in professional tennis. She only made it as far as the fourth round at the Australian Open.

LIGONIER, Pennsylvania — All that remained of Ruthie's Diner on Wednesday morning was charred, ice-encased rubble — the aftermath of firefighters' desperate efforts to extinguish the blaze that ultimately consumed the modest eatery, which for more than 70 years had served locals and the travelers, anglers, and hunters heading east along the Lincoln Highway.

Several locals pulled into the parking lot and simply stared, at a loss for words as they watched a community mainstay reduced to charred ruins, thin smoke still rising from the ashes.

Ruthie's was the kind of place where everyone felt familiar, whether you'd been in last week, last month, or only when hunting and fishing season came around.

It was where my parents took me, and where I later took my children and grandchildren. For anyone who walked through those doors, it felt like home: comforting, unpretentious, and powerful in its simplicity.

It was the kind of place that served chicken-fried steak smothered in gravy, their version of peas and carrots succotash, and a pile of french fries unlike any other. Outside of the mile-high pies, it was the french fries that everyone loved.

Originally known as Burnsy's Diner in the 1950s and 1960s, it was so rooted in the community that it even sponsored its own bowling team in the Ligonier Valley league and was famous for staying open 24 hours a day.

Every time I went, I met not just locals, but hunters and anglers on their way to cabins, Pittsburgh families headed for the Flight 93 National Memorial or Idlewild, and neighbors gathering after Sunday services at one of the many churches that dot this Westmoreland County village.

Now Ruthie's joins that painful category of “used-to-be” places that linger in the memory long after they're gone. And this wasn't the familiar story of neglect or empty tables slowly choking the life out of a business, which does not make the loss hurt any less.

In bigger, more transient places, a loss like this barely registers. But here, the loss of Ruthie's lands like a gut punch, largely because the people who filled its booths weren't passing through; they were planted. Most Americans, for example, still live close to where they grew up. A U.S. Census Bureau study found that by age 26, nearly 60% live within 10 miles of their childhood home, and 80% within 100 miles.

That kind of rootedness rarely shows up in the way news is framed, which too often reflects the worldview of the rootless, the people who dominate the power structures of legacy media. They tend to live in the “super zip codes” of Washington, D.C., and New York, the centers of wealth and power, and their assumptions end up shaping the national story the rest of us are handed.

Why does that matter when it comes to Ruthie's? Because people who live unrooted lives, not always, but often, are less able to grasp what's really lost when a place like this disappears. This wasn't just the closing of a diner. It was the loss of a room that held whole chapters of life, dinners with grandparents who are gone now, late-night meals with high school friends, the familiar booth you could still return to instead of relegating all of it to memory.

Those attachments aren't sentimental clutter. They're part of emotional well-being. There's real power in being able to revisit the places that shaped you — and in being able to bring your children and grandchildren into them, so the story becomes something shared, not just remembered.

Ruthie's wasn't just stitched into the social fabric of this area; it was part of American roadside culture. It opened long before the Pennsylvania Turnpike existed, back when the Lincoln Highway carried travelers from one end of the state to the other, and sometimes from one end of the country to the other.

And it endured. It survived the turnpike siphoning away business as cars sped past the exit. It resisted the pull of homogenized chain-restaurant menus, and the even worse temptation of food fads, holding fast instead to the same personal touch through every shift in America's driving and dining habits.

The social cohesion that Ruthie's gave everyone who passed through her doors has left a void, one that tells the story of all of us, and serves as a reminder to hold on, frequent, and cherish the Ruthie's in your city or town.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","CBP official Rodney Scott faces ire of Noem and Lewandowski","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/4423912/noem-lewandowski-campaign-oust-trump-border-leader-sources/","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:11:57 GMT","

EXCLUSIVE — Senior Trump administration officials, including a Cabinet member, tried to force out President Donald Trump's top border official over disagreements about how to reach the president's deportation goals and ethical concerns, eight sources alleged during conversations with the Washington Examiner.

Those involved said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Corey Lewandowski, a special government employee at DHS and Noem's close ally, have waged an aggressive campaign to make U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott so uncomfortable at work that he would resign.

The lengths that the officials have gone to nudge Scott toward the exit were described by two people as “evil.” The tactics, the sources said, included actions that would negatively impact the families of senior CBP staff.

Noem and Lewandowski view Scott as a threat to their success atop the 260,000-person department because Scott, a federal agent of three decades, has voiced concerns about the approach the duo has taken to enforce immigration laws.

“[Scott] asks questions or challenges them when they make decisions that they may not have knowledge of, or should I say, have no experience with,” the first source wrote in a text message.

Noem and Lewandowski plotted to promote two Border Patrol agents viewed as loyalists who would continue the flashy, sometimes questionable tactics CBP personnel have used while assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“This is supposed to be the time that we're supposed to be elbows to elbows and rising to the top with all the support that we have from the president, but now we have to deal with this BS instead of trying to really fix the immigration system,” said a second person.

Noem and Lewandowski are not without their reasons. DHS has been under pressure from the White House to increase deportations and expeditiously install the border wall, among many other responsibilities. Getting the president's agenda done is the priority, according to administration officials.

Scott was a Border Patrol agent for 30 years and served as chief during Trump's first term. The Senate confirmed him in June 2025. As CBP commissioner, he oversees 67,000 federal employees and the nation's largest law enforcement agency. CBP is responsible for securing the nation's borders, while ICE handles immigration enforcement inside the country.

Sources said Scott first took issue with DHS leadership because he believed Lewandowski had worked beyond his 130-day cap as a special government employee at DHS, which would render the instructions Scott gave him irrelevant.

Lewandowski has been in the role for a year, and all eight sources said he is very involved in daily operations. The DHS did not answer how many days Lewandowski has worked.

Scott was also concerned about Noem and Lewandowski's approach to immigration enforcement. He had pushed back on how the Border Patrol could be used to help ICE because both agencies had different missions, and the optics could have a lasting, negative effect on the Border Patrol.

“Noem and Lewandowski see people like Rodney Scott, Tom Homan, and Todd Lyons as threats because they carry institutional credibility that doesn't depend on proximity to power or press,” a fourth person said.

The DHS and ICE have been under intense pressure from the White House since last January to amp up arrests and deportations of illegal immigrants, including in a tense showdown last May, when White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller “eviscerated” ICE officials in Washington for not hitting Trump's goal of 3,000 arrests per day.

Sources said it appears DHS has chosen to go after Scott's inner circle to interfere with his work and ultimately drive him out of his position by resigning. Noem does not have the authority to fire Scott; only Trump can do so.

“The most evil was when they attacked other people in retaliation to get to [Scott],” the first person said. “Corey Lewandowski said that he wanted to make it as tough on these people as possible, their families, their children, everybody.”

Scott unexpectedly received an order from DHS leadership in October to fire a senior employee with less than 30 minutes' warning, according to three sources.

“[Scott] was like, ‘Hey, listen, they missed an email. They were driving,'” the first person said. “‘We don't care. We want them fired.' So we're talking government employees who have done their jobs for all these years, some may be close to retiring.”

Scott was told to fire Andrea Bright, CBP's head of Human Resources, who had been in charge of hiring 8,000 new CBP employees funded by the One Big, Beautiful Bill.

“She is like that gal that has worked for the government human resources for so many years that all the other agencies seek her out because she's so smart,” said the first person. “She was the one at CBP who was responsible for moving some of those Border Patrol officials to ICE to take over those field offices.”

The Washington Examiner reported in October that DHS was planning to move lower-ranking Border Patrol agents to leadership positions at ICE. Scott was accused of slow-rolling that effort, though those aware of it said the pace was not in his control and was affected by the speed of the White House Office of Personnel Management.

About a month ago, Scott learned that his chief of staff, James Kernochan, had been abruptly moved to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Scott's deputy, John Modlin, who had previously been the head of Border Patrol in Tucson, Arizona, was given seven days to decide whether to resign, retire, or relocate his family to Boston for an unrelated homeland security job.

“I don't think for one minute Donald Trump knows that a 30-year veteran of the Border Patrol who grinded out the whole entirety of the Biden administration, most of it in Washington, is getting treated like he just walked in off a f****** bus,” said a fourth person. “He's not some schlub.”

CBP's Executive Assistant Commissioner of Enterprise Services Ntina Cooper, an award-winning government employee who personally briefed Trump on border wall plans, was also let go.

The DHS-aligned source said Scott “overpromised and underdelivered” on installing the border wall quickly, saying that progress had been “incredibly slow.”

“When the promise of building two miles in a week is underdelivered on … pressure starts to come from the White House,” the same person said.

The Trump administration installed 20 miles of wall in its first year, compared to none being built in new areas of the border 30 months into the president's first term.

Half of the wall installed thus far was funded through the One Big, Beautiful Bill, which CBP could not spend until September. The other half came from unused money from fiscal 2018, which two sources said Noem did not know was available for use.

The same official who defended Noem and Lewandowski said the border was secured before Scott was confirmed in his position in June, largely by the Coast Guard and Department of War assets.

CBP data shows that illegal immigrant arrests at the southern border did drop to below 10,000 per month in many of the first six months of 2025, down from 100,000 to 250,000 arrests monthly under Biden. Given that the border went from a crisis state to quiet, agents have been sent nationwide to help ICE.

In an internal memo obtained by the Washington Examiner, Scott told senior officials across the agency in December about his new deputy, whom the DHS had selected for him. The new appointee was Joseph Mazzara, previously special counsel to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whom Noem later tapped to serve as acting general counsel at DHS headquarters.

All matters were now to go through Scott's deputy commissioner, rather than him, sources said the DHS told Scott.

Scott also shared that three new officials would move into his office, none of whom he had selected.

Last week, a senior CBP official, Steve Schorr, was abruptly fired.

“[Scott] told him to do something, and one of those new three folks told him that nothing is to leave that office till it goes through them [even though they are ranked below him]. So they fired him — they guy that's a year away from retirement,” said the fourth person.

Seven sources said they anticipate that if Scott resigns or Trump is convinced by Noem and Lewandowski to fire him, DHS will move Michael Banks, the national chief of the Border Patrol, to take over as CBP commissioner. Banks had retired from the Border Patrol as a GS-14, below the rank required to oversee it.

Banks has strong ties to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who told the Washington Examiner in an interview last week that his work on the border with Banks was a leading reason Trump won in 2024, suggesting close ties between Texas and the Trump administration.

“After he was elected, Trump called me and thanked me for what I did in the busing program because he said it shined a white hot spotlight on a very important issue, and suddenly he was able to gain traction on that issue, and that was one pivotal reason why he was elected to be president,” Abbott said.

In place of Banks, those involved anticipate Noem and Lewandowski want to push Gregory Bovino to be Border Patrol chief. Bovino, the Border Patrol's El Centro, California, regional leader was tapped last June to oversee a temporary surge of agents into Los Angeles. 

Five people said Noem made that decision and told Bovino he would report directly to her, an unprecedented move to have Bovino go around Scott and Border Patrol's national chief, Mike Banks. The DHS and CBP did not address or dispute this point when asked for comment.

Bovino has led Border Patrol to other cities and is currently in Minneapolis.

When asked for comment on the list of concerns that sources shared, the White House, DHS, and agencies shared similar statements that maintained Trump's team was united in its mission.

“This is one team and we have one fight to secure the homeland. President Trump has a brilliant, tenacious team led by Secretary Noem to deliver on the American people's mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from this country,” the DHS spokesperson said in a statement. “Everyone is on the same page: the President's page. Stephen Miller, Tom Homan, Todd Lyons, Corey Lewandowski, Rodney Scott, Gregory Bovino, and Mike Banks are patriots who wake up every day to make this country and its people safer.”

ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said Lewandowski “has been a force in helping” federal law enforcement and Noem “is the most effective” DHS secretary in history.

“The President's entire immigration and homeland security team – including Secretary Noem and CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott – are on the same page and have worked seamlessly together to deliver on the President's agenda,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote in an email.

Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday praising Scott for a “great interview,”, a move that was met with relief among those who spoke with the Washington Examiner. DHS and CBP personnel who shared information anonymously, as they are not permitted to speak with the press, said they fear being “polygraphed” by the secretary's team upon publication of the story and that DHS would search for those who spoke out.

TRUMP'S BORDER SECURITY MEASURES GO FAR BEYOND A WALL. HERE'S WHAT THEY ENTAIL

Scott was asked about the claims in an email. In a statement sent from CBP, Scott focused on the results of the Trump administration.

“Under President Trump, U.S. Border Czar Homan, and Secretary Noem, we have delivered the most secure border in American history,” Scott said. “We are operating with the President's vision and innovative and efficient execution, not the old ways. We are all working to implement the President's agenda.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Mary Miller introduces bill to block investors from ‘crowding families out of homes'","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/4428837/gop-rep-miller-bill-block-investors-buying-homes/","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 09:43:56 GMT","

Rep. Mary Miller (R-IL) introduced legislation on Wednesday to help people achieve the American dream of owning a home. Miller's legislation proposes restrictions on large corporations, companies, and investors to prevent them from “crowding families out of homes.”

Miller's American Family Housing Act calls to amend the “Investment Company Act of 1940 to prohibit certain large-scale companies from purchasing single-family residences.” The bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to limit the number of single-family homes that “large institutional investors” can buy so that ordinary working-class families can afford to purchase houses at reasonable prices. Miller's objective with this legislation is to put “an end to Wall Street firms driving up prices and pushing families out of the housing market.”

“Homeownership is the foundation of the American Dream,” said Miller. “But today, hardworking families are competing with massive Wall Street firms that are buying up single-family homes and pricing Americans out of their own communities.”

Miller's American Family Housing Act comes on the heels of President Donald Trump's executive order “Stopping Wall Street From Competing With Main Street Homebuyers,” issued on Jan. 20. Trump's order also prioritized housing affordability for everyday people over investment firms purchasing properties. 

“Hardworking young families cannot effectively compete for starter homes with Wall Street firms and their vast resources,” read Trump's directive. “Neighborhoods and communities once controlled by middle-class American families are now run by faraway corporate interests.”

“People live in homes, not corporations,” Trump said. “My Administration will take decisive action to stop Wall Street from treating America's neighborhoods like a trading floor and empower American families to own their homes.”

Miller presented the numerous challenges people face when purchasing a home in the country today as justification for her bill in a press release on Wednesday.

“According to the National Association of Realtors, the average first-time homebuyer is now 40 years old, with first-time buyers making up just 21 percent of the market,” read Miller's release. “A 2024 Government Accountability Office study estimated that institutional investors collectively own roughly 300,000 homes nationwide, with ownership heavily concentrated in metropolitan areas. In some cities in America, institutional investors own 25% of single-family rentals.”

TRUMP'S BATTLE WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE FACES SUPREME COURT TEST

To offer a remedy to these challenges, Miller's bill would restrict “large-scale” companies from purchasing “any single-family residence” and require the SEC to “monitor and enforce restrictions preventing large institutional investment firms from purchasing single-family homes.” Miller's bill would apply such requirements only to future purchases and would be limited to corporations with “more than $100 billion in assets under management.” It would take effect 100 days after the bill's approval to prevent sizable fluctuations and market destabilization.

“President Trump is right to confront this crisis, and my American Family Housing Act ensures homes are owned by families, not large institutional investors,” Miller said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A paid left-wing provocateur, who operates a travel fund that covers expenses associated with accosting “Nazis,” joined the takeover of a Minneapolis-area church as part of an activist coalition's protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

William Kelly, an anti-Trump agitator traveling across the country to sites of political conflict, appeared to be a central figure in the shutdown of Sunday services at Cities Church, a Christian parish in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Kelly, alongside a mob of activists, allegedly stormed Cities Church over the weekend, disrupting a Sunday sermon based on allegations that one of the pastors, David Easterwood, is an ICE official. A man with the same name and likeness serves as ICE's acting director for the agency's St. Paul field office.

Afterward, on social media, Kelly said he had “the honor of protesting David Easterwood's church with Nekima Armstrong and the Racial Justice Network!”

Nekima Levy Armstrong, head of the Minnesota-based Racial Justice Network, was the chief coordinator of the well-organized church protest.

BLM COALITION BEHIND ANTI-ICE SHUTDOWN OF MINNEAPOLIS CHURCH SERVICE

Armstrong later thanked Kelly and former CNN host Don Lemon in a Facebook post for their efforts. Lemon, Kelly, and other “independent journalists” were reportedly privy to operational plans kept under wraps until the so-called “surprise operation” actually unfolded.

At the church, Lemon and Kelly recorded the protesters carrying out the “clandestine mission,” adding narration that couched their conduct as constitutionally protected activity.

Notably, when the activists initially assembled in a nearby parking lot, the protest's staging grounds, Lemon met them there and began livestreaming before they barged into Cities Church that morning.

Kelly, during the demonstration, filmed himself directly confronting lead pastor Jonathan Parnell and shouting in the faces of parishioners, even following them to their cars with crying children in tow.

“I had no idea I was going to the church that day,” Kelly said when contacted by the Washington Examiner. “I saw a flyer for a protest and showed up to support the Black Community.”

A staple in the anti-ICE activism scene, Kelly appears at pop-up protests all around the country, deploying confrontational tactics intended to provoke his political opponents.

Most recently, Kelly left Minneapolis for an anti-Tesla rally in downtown Los Angeles on Jan. 16, took a red-eye flight to Chicago for a protest outside an ICE facility on Jan. 17, and jetted back to Minneapolis in time for the Cities Church occupation on Jan. 18.

In a message to supporters, Kelly told his followers, “I plan on organizing some larger movements across the country! I will do my best to come support every city being attacked by fascism!”

Kelly, known as “DaWoke Farmer” on TikTok, crowdfunds financing for his cross-country trips through a standing campaign on GoFundMe, originally titled “Help Me to Continue Agitating the Nazis.”

“Road Trip!! Help me travel the Nation scolding the Gestapo for their bad decisions!” Kelly, who also collects contributions on CashApp, captioned the fundraising campaign. “No rest for demons!”

To date, the GoFundMe page has raised over $43,000 in donations, many of them coming in after the Department of Justice threatened to file federal charges against the organizers and collaborators of the church protest.

GUERRILLA-LIKE ‘ICE WATCH' GROUPS BACKED BY TOP LEFT-WING GRANTMAKERS

Lemon, in particular, has been put “on notice” by Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, chief of the DOJ's civil rights division, for possible violations of the FACE Act, a federal law protecting places of worship from protests.

As seen on Lemon's livestream, the former CNN host bought donuts and coffee at a Starbucks location and then distributed them to protesters. “Don Lemon is on the front lines right now!” one anti-ICE activist announced on a megaphone. “Don Lemon's got coffee for y'all!” To which Lemon added, “And donuts.”

“Whoever paid for, coordinated, or participated in this attack made a big—BIG—mistake,” Harmeet warned. “No worshipper in this country should ever feel intimidated in a house of God, and @TheJusticeDept will bring the full force of the law, as directed by [Attorney General Pam Bondi].”

In response, Kelly said he was protesting “a white supremacist church.”

“F**k ‘em!” Kelly reacted, dismissing the DOJ investigation and further challenging federal officials to arrest him. “They wanna come after me? F**k ‘em!”

In an expletive-filled video statement, Kelly claimed that Muslim immigrants in Minnesota are not able to pray without the fear of ICE raiding their mosques.  “How do they deserve any f**king different?” Kelly said, referring to the Christian churchgoers. “F**k those f**king Nazis! Come and get me, Pam Bondi, you f**king traitorous b*tch.”

Kelly insisted to the Washington Examiner that they were invited into the church, countering claims that the protesters trespassed.

“We preached the words of Jesus. We left,” Kelly said. “They never asked us to leave. The police never talked to us. The service continued with music and prayer the entire time we were in there.”

Calling the threats of charges “baseless,” Kelly said his lawyers assured him that he would prevail should prosecutors bring a case against him.

Justin Overbaugh, the U.S. deputy undersecretary of war for intelligence and security, informed Bondi on X that Kelly has also been part of a mob that routinely harasses congregants at Christ Church, a parish attended by War Secretary Pete Hegseth in Washington, D.C.

Since the church's founding last summer, the group gathers on the premises weekly, blaring bullhorns to disrupt church services “in clear violation of the law,” Overbaugh said.

DOJ PROBING ANTI-ICE PROTEST AT MINNEAPOLIS CHURCH SERVICE

The situation grew so serious that one churchgoer was sent to the hospital with a shattered eardrum after a protester “let loose with the full force of a bullhorn in his ear,” Joe Rigney, a pastor of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho, which founded the D.C. church, wrote for the Christian news magazine World.

Kelly has a reputation as one of the most disruptive regulars stationed outside the church.

“He screams incredibly vile and gross things at families, at children, at people,” a Christ Church member told Fox News. “He's called my wife a c*nt, a wh*re, and a Nazi breeder, all sorts of fun things.”

Kelly and others screaming such obscenities as parishioners enter and exit the sanctuary has culminated in the parish's requests for police escorts.

Last month, Kelly captured on camera one of his profanity-laden confrontations with Hegseth.

“I've been waiting for this for a long time,” Kelly said in a December podcast appearance. “I go to his church almost every Sunday, and I miss him every time. So this was a long time coming.”

Some of Kelly's other past targets include members of the National Guard, whom he heckled near Union Station less than two weeks after two troops were ambushed by gunfire in the nation's capital.

Kelly was arrested in December for allegedly stalking a random father, calling the man “a Nazi piece of sh*t” while his children watched. According to Kelly, investigators are “moving forward with disorderly conduct charges” against him.

LIBERAL ACTIVISTS USE AGGRESSIVE ‘ICE WATCH' TACTICS TO TARGET FEDERAL OFFICERS IN MINNEAPOLIS

Dhillon confirmed that Kelly was recently arrested and released days prior to the Cities Church protest in Minnesota for allegedly impeding ICE. After authorities set him free on Friday, Kelly claimed that he was “kidnapped by ICE.”

Kelly told the Washington Examiner that he is now suing the Department of Homeland Security on wrongful arrest and excessive violence claims in connection to Friday's arrest.

“I will not be intimidated,” Kelly said. “The real violation of the FACE Act is being carried out by [Homeland Security Secretary] Kristi Noem every single day. The fear caused by her masked goons and their disregard of due process leaves us citizens afraid to leave their homes. They are afraid to go to mass or prayer!”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A moment of truth in Minnesota.

It's a recurring feature of anti-ICE protests: the presence of pastors, priests, and reverends on the front lines of demonstrations, and behind the scenes, organizing in their communities.

In Chicago last year, religious leaders were pepper sprayed or shot with pepper balls. In Minneapolis this month, they've joined protesters in calling for restraint from federal agents and humane treatment of immigrants. And nationally, there is growing realization from some leaders of the need for moral clarity and pushback to the Trump administration.

But religious leaders and their followers aren't all reacting in the same way to the federal government's mass deportation surges.

A recent anti-ICE protest in St. Paul, which interrupted a service at a Southern Baptist church with alleged ties to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, grabbed national attention, sparked outrage from the religious right, and impelled the White House to promise arrests and investigations. And it also triggered responses from some Christian leaders who have been more reticent to criticize the administration.

To break down these divisions and the different ways that religious leaders in and beyond Minnesota are responding, I decided to ask an expert. Jack Jenkins is a national reporter for the Religion News Service, where he covers religion and politics. He spoke to me in between trips to Minneapolis, where multifaith leaders will be meeting this week to organize and discuss ways to tend to their communities and respond to ICE's presence.

Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

I want to start off with a bird's-eye view. Can you describe how religious communities, both believers and their leaders, are responding to ICE's presence in Minnesota right now?

I spent most of my time in Minneapolis and it is much easier to find someone who is vehemently opposed to ICE than the opposite. I think for a lot of faith communities there's an immediate concern for the people they serve.

For instance, pastors that oversee immigrant-heavy congregations. I spoke to a pastor out there; that's a lot of stress. They are also very much organizing, but for a variety of reasons that organizing isn't necessarily public. And it's relatively rare for a lot of those pastors to be even as public or talking to the press because of concerns for their community. And that's not just Christian pastors, that's also imams because the Somali American community also has become a target of this administration.

Then there is also this piece of religious communities that are not as at risk, not as vulnerable, who've been very involved in pushback to ICE and to DHS agents. That runs the gamut. There's one church in particular who helps gather food and supplies to feed large numbers of immigrant families that are afraid to leave their homes in the midst of heavy DHS presence in the region. A lot of churches are involved in that kind of effort.

There's also more direct acts of resistance too, though, aren't there?

Yes. I rode along with a pastor who was involved in patrolling the neighborhood where she lives, which happens to be the same neighborhood where Renee Good was killed, looking for DHS agents. In the hour and a half that I rode along with her, we spotted likely DHS agents at least twice as they were driving by being tailed by other cars that were honking horns and blowing whistles to alert the community.

Even after Renee Good was killed, there were multiple clergy that ran to the site of the killing, including that same Unitarian minister, Reverend Ashley Horan, who lives a block away, to try to provide some level of immediate response. Both that pastor and another were shot at or hit with pepper spray or pepper powder.

But when I was patrolling that area with that pastor, every other corner had somebody with a whistle around their neck looking out for DHS. Faith groups are very much a part of that.

Does there seem to be any difference in how faith leaders or communities within the state are responding compared to how voices nationally are talking about this?

“We are seeing far more faith leaders get directly involved as cities are targeted.”

Religious pushback to President Trump's mass deportation agenda began on day one.

There was that sermon that Bishop Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, gave at the Washington National Cathedral with Trump sitting in the pews in front of her asking the president to have mercy on immigrants. That drew headlines. Religious pushback to his immigration policies hasn't let up since. We've had two popes criticize Trump's immigration policies. Pope Leo specifically addressed concerns about whether detainees in Chicago were being granted access to faith leaders.

But what's interesting is what has happened as the administration has launched concentrated efforts in various cities. Early on, I covered a pastor in Southern California where apparent DHS agents showed up on her church property. She ran out and filmed them, demanding they leave. Similarly in California, a pastor got a call that two parishioners were being detained. He ran out and filmed the DHS agents while questioning them.

As these campaigns moved from LA to Portland to DC to Chicago to North Carolina, faith leaders have told me they were in conversation with clergy in cities targeted earlier, training them and sharing information about how to push back against ICE and DHS. When Border Patrol had an influx of agents in Charlotte, within 24 to 48 hours, hundreds of people packed churches hosting ICE watch trainings. Those trainings had actually been planned months earlier.

We are seeing far more faith leaders get directly involved as cities are targeted. Chicago was a good example, where faith leaders were arrested at one protest outside a DHS facility. That likely wouldn't have happened without these concentrated campaigns.

I want to ask about the outrage after the ICE protest that interrupted a church service in St. Paul. What happened?

The allegation, which I cannot independently confirm, is that one of the pastors of that church is also head of a local ICE or DHS office. Old versions of the church website list him as having been involved in law enforcement. That appears to have been the impetus for that protest.

What followed was interesting. Even religious leaders critical of DHS were uneasy with the nature of that protest and said so publicly. At the same time, many were frustrated by the administration's reaction and by conservative Christian responses, because dozens of faith groups have opposed DHS actions, have signed onto lawsuits against the administration for claims of violations of religious freedom.

In Chicago last year, viral footage showed DHS agents shooting a Presbyterian minister in the head with pepper balls. I've spoken to several pastors who've been hit with pepper spray or pepper balls. By my count, between eight and 10 pastors over the last year. That Presbyterian minister, Reverend David Black, was part of a lawsuit that won a temporary restraining order based on religious freedom claims.

Some faith leaders argue there's a selective concern for religious liberty. One activist involved in that St. Paul protest said, paraphrasing, that houses of worship are either sanctuaries or they're not. Who gets attention for religious freedom concerns has become a running theme.

What about Catholic leaders? I've seen criticism about when they do or don't speak up, against Trump, specifically some of the most vocal Catholic bishops, like Robert Barron, a conservative leaning Catholic media mogul, and the bishop of the diocese of Winona-Rochester in Minnesota.

It's very rare to see a bishop involved in a protest. That's why it stood out when an auxiliary bishop in Chicago participated in a demonstration outside a DHS facility over detainees being denied access to priests. There is also a lawsuit filed by Catholic organizations, priests, and nuns on that issue.

There's been an awkward dance where the pope has often spoken louder and faster than local bishops. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued a critical statement and video opposing the administration's immigration policies, and the conference has sued the administration before.

Now Bishop Barron is an interesting figure. He sits on the president's Religious Liberty Commission and has enormous influence. When concerns were raised about detainee access to priests, Barron joined in voicing concern, but later emphasized that he was not criticizing the administration.

There's increasing tension inside the bishops' conference. Groups of bishops are issuing statements independently on immigration. That didn't use to happen. It reflects deeper division over how to respond to the president's immigration agenda.

Why does that division exist?

Some bishops occupy different institutional positions. Sitting on a federal religious liberty commission is different than leading a diocese. Holding leadership within the USCCB conference matters. Since Pope Francis and now Pope Leo, the pope has often been more vocal than the conference as a whole, which creates tension. Now that there is an American pope from Chicago, those tensions are sharper.

Let me ask you about a quote from a bishop in New England. You spoke to him because he attracted attention for telling other faith leaders that the time is coming when they may have to to “put [their] bodies on the line.” What did he mean by that?

When I spoke to the Episcopal bishop of New Hampshire, who said clergy should get their “wills in order,” he told me he's said similar things in the past around gun control advocacy. He was seconded by the Episcopal bishop of Minnesota. In Chicago, more than 200 faith leaders signed a letter referencing putting their bodies on the line.

Many reference Selma, the protests and marches of the civil rights movement, clergy who were killed there, and figures like Bonhoeffer, the Lutheran pastor who was ultimately killed for his part in an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Many faith leaders I speak to say those in more privileged positions should go first because they are least vulnerable. If faith leaders aren't doing it, they argue, then who will?

Should we expect more of this?

I'm about to return to Minneapolis for a gathering of clergy from around the country. They are explicitly likening it to a call to Selma. As long as the administration continues targeted campaigns in cities, I would expect more of this.

What's standing in the way of our robot overlords.

The robots in my building are multiplying. It started with one roughly the size of a doghouse that cleans the floors, and not very well — a commercial-grade Roomba that talks to you if you get in its way. Somehow, I'm always in its way.

My landlord was clearly excited about the new, technical marvel of an addition to the building, which takes up half the size of a New York City block. There are plenty of floors to clean and human hours of labor to save. Then my landlord told me the robot, which had been confined to the lobby, could now wirelessly connect to the elevator and control it. The robot now rides up and down all day, exiting the elevator to clean each floor's hallway. The landlord, pleased with this new complexity, got two more, bigger robots to complete the fleet. In the spring, he told me with a straight face, there would be drones to clean the windows. I fully expect to see them as soon as Daylight Savings Time kicks in.

If you believe the press releases, we're about to start seeing more robots everywhere — and not just doghouse-sized Roombas. Humanoid robots are on track to be a $200 billion industry by 2035 “under the most optimistic scenarios,” according to a new report from Barclays Research. The cost of the hardware needed to give robots powerful arms and legs has plummeted in the last decade, and the AI boom is giving investors hope that powerful brains will soon follow. That's why you're now hearing about consumer-grade humanoids like the 1X Neo and the Figure 03, which are designed to be robot butlers.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

The full picture of what humanoids can do is more complicated, however. As James Vincent explained in Harper's Magazine last month, the promises robotics startups are making often don't line up with the reality of the technology. I've been learning this firsthand as I work on a feature of my own about embodied AI, which recently took me inside a number of labs at MIT. (Stay tuned for that in the coming weeks.)

One of the robots I saw there was the 4-foot-tall Unitree G1, which can dance and do backflips. It's like a mini Atlas, the humanoid robot built by Boston Dynamics that you've probably seen on YouTube, but made in China for a fraction of the price. Will Knight recently profiled Unitree for Wired and argued that China, not the United States, is poised to lead the robot revolution on the back of its cheap hardware and ability to iterate on new designs. Still, a dancing robot is not necessarily an intelligent one.

If you haven't heard of a “thing biography,” you've definitely come across one of the books. Mauve: How One Man Invented a Colour That Changed the World by Simon Garfield is sometimes credited as the accidental original example of the genre. Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World is the book that turned me onto it, when it became a bestseller nearly 30 years ago. You can now read thing biographies, also known as microhistories, about bananas, wood, rope — really any thing has a fascinating history that you may find sitting on a shelf at an airport bookshop. (Slate's Decoder Ring podcast has a great episode explaining the phenomenon.)

What makes these books especially fun is that they're not at all about the things themselves. They're about us. The history of cod is really about what the fish tells us about exploration and human ingenuity. One of my favorites from the genre is The World in a Grain: The Story of Sand and How It Transformed Civilization. It is nearly 300 pages about sand, which is in fact what everything important, from concrete to microchips, is made of. And we're running out of it.

AI is inherently physical, because it needs hardware to exist. And I'm not just talking about the actuators, motors, and sensors that make machines move. The high-powered Nvidia chips that promise to provide the processing power needed to provide dumb backflipping robots with a brain that can turn them into general-purpose appliances? They're made of sand. It's really good sand, of course — sand that's been purified and processed in some of the most advanced manufacturing facilities humankind has ever built. But as the conversation around advanced hardware powered by even more advanced software is changing our relationship with technology, I find it grounding to know that we're dealing with familiar ingredients.

If you think that sitting around reading books about sand is too escapist, let me offer a compromise. For a dose of reality, you should check out Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology by Chris Miller. It's also about sand, but it's specifically about the history of semiconductors in the United States and the arms race it eventually kicked off with China. As the Trump administration inches closer to attempting to seize Greenland, many are left to worry that China's Xi Jinping will invade Taiwan and take control of its advanced chipmaking facilities. If China cuts off Taiwan, which produces 90 percent of the advanced chips needed for AI applications, the digital economy would grind to a halt, according to my Vox colleague Joshua Keating. China wouldn't just lead the robot revolution. It would own it.

The robots in my building, I'm guessing, weigh about 120 pounds apiece. It's an informed guess, because I've had to pick them up to move them out of my way. If you move too quickly or intimidate them too much — not that I've done this on purpose — they freeze. As a safety feature, this is great. But the other day, I was getting on the elevator, freaked out a robot, and the elevator wouldn't move. I took the stairs.

In a sense, though, these failures are essential. Every couple of weeks, I see a technician come and work on the robots. They might be replacing a part, updating its software, or just giving them a pep talk. It's a reminder that inching toward a future in which embodied AI, probably robots, helps us unlock humanity's greatest potential is a process, and probably a long one.

Many people credit Elon Musk with starting the race to build a general-purpose humanoid, when he announced Tesla's effort to do so back in 2021. Musk has shown off various prototypes of the Tesla humanoid, Optimus, in the years since then. Many of them are just puppets, operated by employees behind the scenes. This week, Musk admitted that manufacturing the humanoids would be “agonizingly slow” before it hopefully got faster. I truly wonder, what's the rush?

In the consulting industry's era of AI upheaval, even job titles aren't safe.

The Big Four firm Deloitte is rolling out a sweeping overhaul of how it refers to its US workforce and introducing a new class of leader.

""All professionals will receive a new title that we will start to use internally and externally on June 1, 2026,"" said a presentation shared with employees during a meeting on Wednesday morning, which Business Insider has seen.

Deloitte plans to tell employees their new job titles on January 29, before they take effect at the start of the firm's next financial year in June.

The meeting, hosted by Mo Reynolds, Deloitte US's chief people officer, was held for the consulting division, but the changes apply to all Deloitte's US divisions, the presentation said. Deloitte had 181,500 employees in the US as of May 31, 2025.

The firm also announced a new leadership role during Wednesday's meeting.

Currently, the most senior titles at the firm are partners, principals, and managing directors — known as PPMD. Starting in June, a role titled ""leaders"" will join the group, according to the presentation.

""We are modernizing our talent architecture to provide a more tailored experience reflective of our professionals' broad range of skills and the work they do,"" a Deloitte spokesperson told Business Insider.

The overhaul of titles comes as Deloitte and its peers face existential questions posed by AI in the consulting industry. The technology is changing what it means to be a consultant, affecting long-held talent structures, pricing models, and the work that clients want from their consultants.

In the internal presentation, Deloitte frames the changes as a necessary modernization for a changing market.

After a slide titled ""why now?"" the firm explains that its current talent architecture is ""outdated"" and unable to ""support our business of tomorrow.""

The current structure was designed for ""a more homogenous workforce of 'traditional' consulting profiles,"" according to the presentation. ""But so much has changed.""

Deloitte's workforce and business have grown, employees are seeking more tailored talent experiences, and ""our clients are demanding new skills and capabilities,"" the presentation said.

By redesigning its talent architecture, Deloitte aims to better match employees' work with their titles, clarify career levels, and give people doing similar work more consistent experiences.

Day-to-day work, leadership, and the firm's ""compensation philosophy"" will all stay the same, according to the presentation.

Consultants at Deloitte have traditionally followed a progression path of analyst, senior analyst, consultant, senior consultant, manager, and senior manager, before promotion to the top echelons of the firm.

Under the new system, these titles will become more specific and include reference to a ""job family"" and ""sub-family,"" which are another new feature introduced in the talent overhaul.

In an example from the presentation, an employee with the current job title of ""senior consultant"" could become ""senior consultant, functional transformation,"" ""software engineer III,"" or ""project management senior consultant"" on June 1.

Internally, employees will also be assigned an alphanumeric reference to indicate their job level, such as L45 for what is currently a senior consultant and L55 for current managers.

These more specific titles will ""drive greater clarity and market relevancy,"" according to the presentation.

Goldman Sachs has hiked its gold price forecast by 10% on the back of blistering private-sector demand for the precious metal.

Analysts at the Wall Street giant now expect gold prices to reach $5,400 per troy ounce by the end of the year, up from $4,900 per ounce in their previous forecast, as private sector diversification into gold has started to play out.

""The rally has accelerated since 2025 because central banks started competing for limited bullion with private sector investors,"" wrote analysts Daan Struyven and Lina Thomas in a Thursday note.

That acceleration followed a period of strong official-sector buying, during which central bank purchases underpinned robust gold price gains in 2023 and 2024.

Spot gold was trading around $4,800 per ounce on Thursday. Prices pulled back from a record high of around $4,888 per ounce amid easing US-Europe tensions over Greenland.

The price of the yellow metal has risen 11% so far this year and more than doubled since the start of 2023, when it traded around $1,865 per ounce.

Demand for gold has strengthened across the private sector.

Goldman's analysts wrote that the dash for gold has taken place through traditional ETF purchases, as well as a growing range of investment instruments designed to hedge global macro policy risks. They also pointed to high-net-worth families snapping up physical gold and investors buying call options.

Goldman's upgraded price forecast reflects support from potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, as well as central banks buying an average of 60 metric tons per month in 2026 as emerging markets diversify their asset holdings into the yellow metal.

The analysts said they assume demand for hedges against global macro policy risks will remain steady. They wrote that risks — such as concerns over government debt and long-term budget pressures — are unlikely to be fully resolved in 2026, keeping elevated gold prices on a durable footing.

""In commodities, the usual maxim that 'high prices cure high prices' does not apply to gold,"" wrote Goldman's analysts.

This is because gold supply doesn't change much when prices rise or fall.

Most gold already exists and just gets traded between owners, while new mining adds only a tiny amount each year — about 1% of the total gold in the world. Output is steady and cannot quickly increase, even when prices jump, the analysts wrote.

As a result, gold prices typically stop rising only when demand weakens: when geopolitical tensions calm down and central banks feel less need to diversify, when economic and policy risks ease and private investors pull back, or when the Federal Reserve shifts from cutting interest rates to raising them.

Business Insider Edition 

Ghana is accelerating its industrialisation drive with a renewed focus on electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, as the government moves to create jobs, attract foreign investment, and strengthen the country's competitiveness in clean transport.


        The push builds on earlier engagements with Chinese automakers and has now entered a more advanced phase.
    


        Speaking at the Government Accountability Series on January 21, 2026, Minister of Trade, Agribusiness and Industry Elizabeth Ofosu-Adjare said the government had signed a memorandum of understanding with China's Shenzhen New Jekyll to establish an EV assembly plant in Ghana.
    


        “They are already in Ghana, they have acquired land, and development is far advanced for the factory to begin operations,” Ofosu-Adjare said, signalling that the project has moved beyond preliminary negotiations.
    


        She added that the ministry is also in discussions with Chery International, one of China's major automobile exporters, to set up an additional EV assembly plant following engagements at the China-Africa Summit. 
    


        The talks highlight growing interest from global automakers in Ghana's emerging EV market.
    


        Ghana's EV ambitions form part of a broader strategy to reposition the country as a manufacturing hub in West Africa while supporting its climate and energy transition goals. 
    


        Transport remains a major source of emissions in Ghana's urban centres, and policymakers see EV adoption as a way to reduce fuel imports, cut emissions, and build local industrial capacity.
    


        Chinese manufacturers are playing a central role in this strategy. China dominates the global EV supply chain, from battery technology to affordable vehicle production, and is increasingly targeting emerging markets as growth slows in Europe and North America. 
    


        For Ghana, partnering with Chinese firms offers access to technology, capital, and manufacturing expertise without the heavy upfront research and development costs.
    


        The government has also introduced incentives to encourage EV adoption, including reduced import duties, while exploring regulatory frameworks to support charging infrastructure and after-sales services. 
    


        Industry analysts note that the success of Ghana's EV push will depend on scaling power infrastructure, expanding charging networks, and keeping EVs affordable for consumers.
    


        If executed effectively, Ghana's strategy could help anchor a domestic automotive ecosystem and position the country as a reference point for electric mobility in West Africa, at a time when African countries are competing for a share of the global EV value chain.

Oracle and OpenAI have aimed to build $500 billion of data centers by the end of the decade to power their artificial intelligence ambitions.

But the massive initiative, called Stargate, may be exhausting the supply of available capital.

JPMorgan Chase, the bank that recently led a pack of lenders to extend roughly $38 billion of debt for the construction of two planned Stargate data center campuses in Texas and Wisconsin, has encountered diminished interest as it has sold off pieces of the loan to other financial players, a person familiar with the situation said.

The person said that the two projects are fully financed, the syndication effort by JPMorgan had been successful overall, and that the slowdown in new participants hadn't alarmed bankers given that it was at the tail end of such a large debt offering.

But the person acknowledged that banks and institutional investors had also grown wary in recent months of taking on too much exposure to Oracle, a tech giant whose credit rating sits below some of its peers in the AI race, including Microsoft and Google.

The reticence among lenders and investors to continue bankrolling Stargate raises questions about whether the mega-project will meet its lofty objectives.

""We are hearing from market participants that in some cases, there may be banks that could be approaching the exposure levels they're comfortable with when it comes to certain data center projects,"" said Dhaval Shah, a director at S&P Global Infrastructure Ratings.

The current unprecedented data center development cycle has been dominated by just a handful of leading players, testing whether lenders and investors will remain willing to continue to accrue heavy exposure to borrowers like Oracle. Oracle declined to comment.

In November, credit default swaps that insure against losses on Oracle's corporate debt rose in cost, a reflection of the concerns around the company's enormous spending on AI.

OpenAI, the AI chatbot maker that will anchor the Stargate facilities, meanwhile, produces revenue that is just a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars annually that would be necessary to justify the cost of its infrastructure.

""Oracle has become a proxy for OpenAI's ability to raise significant amounts of capital,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson. ""It's a very precarious position.""

OpenAI announced Stargate a year ago, stating that it would partner with Oracle and others, to build a total of 10 gigawatts of data center capacity by 2029 — roughly the equivalent power footprint of New York City on a day of peak electrical consumption.

In October, OpenAI announced that it had arranged for the construction of six Stargate sites with a total planned capacity of roughly 7 gigawatts, stating that the pipeline ""puts us on a clear path to securing the full $500 billion,10-gigawatt commitment"" it had announced at the beginning of 2025.

Much of the financing for the project, so far, has been provided by major financial institutions that have banded together to share its immense costs — as well as its risks — in what are known as syndication deals. JPMorgan Chase and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group led the syndication effort for the two Stargate projects in Shackelford, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin. Both banks declined to comment.

Bank of America is leading a syndication to finance another Stargate data center campus in Michigan. A person familiar with that effort said that it has attracted interest from syndication takers.

Another group of lenders provided about $18 billion of financing for another Stargate facility in New Mexico, according to Bloomberg.

Initial players in large syndication deals often seek to sell off portions of their loan commitments to other players, including other banks and institutional investors.

But the sale of these positions, which is done to reap quick profits and lower exposure, has become trickier in the case of Stargate.

Two bankers and a financing executive who are familiar with the syndication market said that the rising perception of risk around Stargate meant that lenders now wanted higher yields to lend to it. That has placed recent Stargate syndicators in a position where they can no longer profitably sell off debt that was arranged at tighter spreads just a few months ago.

Stargate borrowing rates may not come down any time soon.

In September, S&P Global Ratings affirmed Oracle's rating at BBB but said it was considering a cut due to the company's enormous planned spending on AI infrastructure. A downgrade below BBB minus would place a junk rating on Oracle debt, raising its borrowing costs significantly.

""I am very surprised these loans were even underwritten at the time,"" Luria said. ""The market has indicated this is not investment-grade debt.""

However, Luria said one scenario in particular could make the loans less risky. OpenAI is now in the process of trying to raise as much as $100 billion, according to reports, giving the Stargate venture a potential cushion of equity and making its debt easier to sell, he said.

""If that happens,"" he said, ""everybody's dreams come true.""

Other bankers who spoke with Business Insider said the slowdown did not indicate acute trouble in the syndication market, but acknowledged that the pool of investors who still have an appetite for the Stargate debt has shrunk.

""Do we have enough digestive capacity"" in the market for investors to buy all of the debt that will be required, said David Tawil, a partner at transaction insurance advisory firm Castle Harbour. ""That's the market's real concern: the size of this whole movement.""

President Donald Trump's push to acquire Greenland is spilling into markets, drawing attention to Europe's leverage in US capital markets.

On Tuesday, Treasurys sold off. Yields climbed to their highest level in more than four months as ""Sell America"" fears gripped markets amid the latest geopolitical tensions. The US Dollar Index also moved lower.

""Europe owns Greenland, it also owns a lot of Treasuries,"" wrote George Saravelos, Deutsche Bank's global head of currency research, in a note on Sunday.

That exposure highlights a key vulnerability for the US, which depends heavily on foreign investors to finance its debt.

European countries own around $8 trillion of US bonds and equities — almost twice as much as the rest of the world combined, according to Deutsche.

""For all its military and economic strength, the US has one key weakness: it relies on others to pay its bills via large external deficits,"" Saravelos added.

He pointed out that Danish pension funds were among the first to repatriate capital and cut dollar exposure last year in response to uncertainty over Trump's policies. Saravelos also warned that dollar exposure across Europe remains elevated.

""In an environment where the geoeconomic stability of the western alliance is being disrupted existentially, it is not clear why Europeans would be as willing to play this part,"" Saravelos said.

Beyond currencies, Saravelos said the real risk lies in capital markets as the US is more vulnerable to foreign investors than ever before.

""It is a weaponization of capital rather than trade flows that would by far be the most disruptive to markets,"" he wrote.

That risk is already starting to be priced in, according to Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.

""The market dynamic we are seeing increasing evidence of is that US assets (including the USD) are now carrying a much higher political risk premium,"" Weston wrote on Monday.

That shift could push foreign investors to reduce their US exposure and adjust how much dollar risk they hold, weighing on the currency and boosting haven assets like gold, he added.

On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed market speculation that Europe could dump its US assets in retaliation for Trump's tariff threat over Greenland.

""There is no talk in European governments,"" Bessent told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, calling it a ""completely false narrative.""

""It defies any logic, and I could not disagree more strongly on that.""

On Wednesday, Bessent said in Davos that Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing called to say that the German lender ""does not stand by that analyst report.""

Deutsche Bank did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment sent outside regular business hours. The company has told media outlets that it ""generally does not comment on ""potential communication between the bank and government representatives.""

""As a matter of long-standing policy, Deutsche Bank Research is independent in their work, therefore views expressed in individual research notes do not necessarily represent the view of the bank's management,"" a spokesperson for the bank said.

Bessent also said on Wednesday that he wasn't concerned about the recent sell-off in Treasurys over President Donald Trump's threats against Greenland.

""Denmark's investment in US Treasury bonds, like Denmark itself, is irrelevant,"" Bessent told reporters.

Treasury yields came off multi-month highs on Wednesday after Trump called off his tariff threat on Europe following a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at Davos.

Trump said that he and Rutte formed a ""framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region.""

January 22, 2026 — This story has been updated with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's comments.

Apple's decision to rebuild Siri around Google's Gemini AI models looks, at first glance, like an admission of failure. After years of promising breakthroughs, Apple is reportedly paying Google roughly $1 billion a year to keep its digital assistant relevant.

Look closer, though, and the move represents something more radical: a giant bet that AI models will become commodities.

Top tech reporter Mark Gurman wrote this week that Apple's revamped Siri, codenamed Campos, will launch later this year as a full-fledged chatbot embedded across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The underlying intelligence will come from Google's Gemini.

The more important detail is architectural. Apple is designing Campos so that the underlying AI models can be swapped out over time, according to Gurman's report for Bloomberg.

""That means the company will have the flexibility to move away from Google-powered systems in the future if it so chooses,"" he wrote.

That design choice tells us a lot about Apple's AI strategy.

Rather than trying to win an AI arms race against Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta by spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure, Apple appears to be positioning itself as model-agnostic. Siri remains Apple's direct interface to more than 1 billion iPhone users. The ""brains"" underneath, however, can change.

If Apple is right, the leading AI models will converge in quality over time, becoming roughly interchangeable. At that point, differentiation shifts away from the model itself and toward distribution, integration, privacy controls, and user experience — areas where Apple already excels.

Apple could then choose whichever AI provider is best, cheapest, or most strategically useful every few years. So, Google's Gemini might power Siri today, but tomorrow it could be OpenAI's latest GPT offering, or Claude from Anthropic, or whatever Meta is cooking up next, or xAI's Grok, or Mistral's offerings, or even region-specific models such as DeepSeek or Alibaba's Qwen in China. Services like OpenRouter already demonstrate how models can be swapped in and out.

Apple is also playing a longer game. Its search deal with Google, worth an estimated $20 billion a year, shows how valuable iPhone distribution is. If AI models truly commoditize, Apple could eventually flip the Siri relationship the same way: AI model providers could end up paying Apple for access to its massive user base.

The strategy also saves Apple enormous capital expenditure. While rivals pour huge sums of money into AI data centers and chips, Apple can let others shoulder that cost. For instance, Google spent more than $60 billion in capex during the first three quarters of 2025, while Apple spent $12.7 billion in its latest fiscal year.

If this AI building boom turns about to be a bust, Apple may dodge a bullet. Of course, it might turn out that underinvesting in your own AI capabilities is a strategic blunder of epic proportions.

We'll see in the next few years. Right now, Apple just placed a huge bet that the real power in the AI era won't belong to model makers, but to whoever controls the interface.

Elon Musk wants to see your results, not your résumé.

The Tesla CEO this week requested that people who want to work on the company's Dojo3 AI chip email three bullet points describing the ""toughest technical problems you've solved.""

Musk's just-the-facts approach, outlined in a post on X, reflects a focus on problem-solving over fancy résumés or cover letters.

""He's basically just trying to cut through the noise of the job market,"" said Michelle Volberg, a longtime recruiter who is the founder of Twill, a startup that pays tech workers to recommend peers for key jobs.

She said that résumés or LinkedIn profiles don't always make it clear to employers where a person's skills lie. Asking a job seeker to lay out a trio of battles won can help hiring managers get to the meat of someone's abilities, Volberg told Business Insider.

It's a way of thinking that she expects more employers will adopt.

""Elon is showing the way that the job market is going to go,"" she said.

Already, some tech companies are eager for job candidates to demonstrate their abilities by highlighting how they arrived at an answer. It's part of what appears to be a show-your-work ethos in Silicon Valley, where hefty spending on AI projects and a hangover from the pandemic-era staffing boom are driving hiring austerity in all but the hottest areas.

Volberg said that hiring managers at large companies have told her that they're sick of relying on résumés so tailored to a job opening that they reveal little about candidates themselves. Asking job seekers to identify a small number of concrete problems they've solved can help overcome that challenge and help bring clarity for hiring managers, she said.

""They don't want to see fluffy résumés that have been written by ChatGPT,"" Volberg said.

Bullets over bona fides is, of course, a departure from the conventional approach of stuffing a résumé with bolded job titles, years of experience, and skills.

Asking applicants to summarize the value they would bring by sharing vignettes of success can elevate technical accomplishment over pedigree or background, she said. It's an example of what some HR types call ""skills-based hiring.""

Musk's no-frills call for applicants appears to build on his prior statements about being open to candidates from nontraditional backgrounds. For years, the billionaire has said that people didn't need a college degree to work for Tesla. Musk has said that he's more focused on evidence of ""exceptional"" ability or achievement.

He also requested bullet points in 2025 when he oversaw efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency group to remake swaths of the US federal government. A nearly year-old post on X said that DOGE was seeking ""world-class"" software engineers, product managers, and data scientists, among other roles.

An application portal linked to the post contains a field instructing applicants to include two or three bullets ""showcasing exceptional ability,"" and to upload a résumé.

Volberg said the bullet method is similar to guidance that her company already gives job seekers: Focus less on adjectives and more on outcomes.

From a hiring manager's perspective, she said, the central question is whether a candidate can make their job easier by solving real problems.

The corollary, Volberg said, is fakers beware: ""If you say that you've solved these three things, you'd better be able to talk about them in detail.""

She said that it's often immediately clear to tech recruiters whether someone has actually done the work they describe. Candidates who exaggerate or fabricate their accomplishments are likely to be found out — and potentially blacklisted, Volberg said.

Beyond candidate chicanery, there could be other risks to Musk's strategy, said David Murray, CEO of Confirm, a San Francisco startup focused on reinventing performance reviews.

Asking people to submit summaries of their greatest tech wins could mean that an employer like Tesla misses out on the quiet contributors and introverts who might not do as good a job promoting themselves, he told Business Insider. Bullets of key achievements — even more than with a typical résumé — require people to make the case for their own work.

Murray said that Musk's approach also overlooks the impacts of the so-called Dunning-Kruger effect, in which people who aren't great at something tend to overestimate their abilities, and those who are ace might assume a task is easy for anyone.

""What he is asking people to do is to market themselves,"" he said.

After living abroad for 15 years, I no longer fit in back home. I know my son won't either.



So I made a deal with myself: If the picket-fence dream hadn't happened by 40, I'd leave. I didn't have a family of my own, but I had freedom, English, and nothing to lose. I packed up my life and accepted a yearlong EFL teaching job in Vietnam.

I took a one-way flight to a city I'd never heard of in a country I'd never visited.

Vietnam's humidity, population density, and traffic overwhelmed me. In Haiphong, the industrial port city in northern Vietnam that I now call home, foreigners are rare, and not many locals speak English. Some older locals don't take kindly to outsiders, so I had a few terse encounters with taxi drivers and traders.

But after three months, the adventure took hold. I went from living and working alone to having housemates, socializing the way I had back at university, learning a new language, and connecting with kids and teens.

When COVID hit halfway through my contract, some younger coworkers left, many were urged by their parents. I stayed.

By the time borders reopened, I'd traveled across the country, formed lasting friendships, taught hundreds of students, and come to belong to a community. I'd become accustomed to the city's gruffness and felt more in tune with its people. It became hard to even contemplate leaving. It still is.

In my time here, I've seldom been lonely. I'm surrounded by younger expat friends who are mostly single. I started a book club and a foodie club. There are daily moments of laughter across language divides with strangers.

Being a middle-aged woman with no husband or children is an anomaly here, but becoming ""Teacher Dee"" has helped me put aside some of the sadness of being childless — not by choice, but by circumstance.

I've gone from lamenting not having children to being surrounded by them. Neighborhood children shout ""Helloooo!"" as they whizz past on their bikes. In shops, parents nudge their kids to practice English with me. I get happy high-fives from spunky students.

Early on, I often directed my interior monologue to my twin sister, narrating my new life to her in my head. These days, I connect with other South African friends who feel similarly torn. We even support our country during rugby matches, something I rarely did back home.

Vietnam has been good to me. I've gained teaching experience, become more sociable, and feel less financially stressed.

Now, nearing seven years of what began as a ""break"" from life back home, I'm contemplating what's next. Friends and family often ask, ""When are you coming back?"" The question looms larger as I edge closer to 50.

Home is no longer one place, but two. I pay for storage in Cape Town while accumulating more than I can fit into two suitcases in Haiphong. I exist in a constant state of longing for one place while living in the other.

I miss the nature, familiarity, and diversity of Cape Town, but I know I'd grieve the freedom, safety, and financial security I've found here. People say, ""It'll always be there, waiting."" I worry instead, ""Has that door closed?""

I panic at the thought of missing all that's uniquely Vietnamese — a place that pulses with energy and possibility. Life spills out through open front doors, down alleys, onto sidewalk stools, into food markets and coffee shops, and onto the backs of zippy scooters. Most of all, I'd miss the people — especially the children.

I see myself eventually settling back in Cape Town, but not yet. For now, I'm betwixt and between — juggling two career paths, with my head and heart stretched across continents.

After enough time abroad, returning can feel as daunting as leaving once did. My belongings are split between two homes, and so am I.

Lululemon's founder said the athleisure company's recall of its sheer ""Get Low"" leggings was a ""new low"" for the brand.

Chip Wilson, Lululemon's founder and former CEO, said in a Wednesday LinkedIn post that the pullback of the leggings was a ""total operational failure,"" and the fault of the company's board.

""I've believed that Lululemon has lost its cool for some time, but it is now evident to me that the Company has completely lost its way as a leader in technical apparel,"" Wilson said on LinkedIn.

He slammed the board, calling them inexperienced and shortsighted.

""It is clear that persistent failures like this are born out of this Board's lack of experience in creative businesses, disinterest in product development and quality, and focus on short-term, self-interested priorities,"" Wilson said.

Lululemon said in a statement to Bloomberg on Wednesday that the collection was still available in stores, but its online sales had been temporarily paused because of guest feedback.

The recall took place less than two years after its ""Breezethrough"" product line was pulled from the market in July 2024, following customer complaints about unflattering seam lines.

Analysts took note of the ""Get Low"" recall.

""LULU's withdrawal of a new legging line underscores ongoing execution issues in its core and raises further concerns about the durability of its innovation engine and premium positioning,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a Tuesday note.

Lululemon's stock price is down about 10% over the past five days and has dropped more than 50% over the past year.

However, Lululemon had another sheer leggings fiasco more than a decade ago, when Wilson was still on the company's board.

In 2013, Lululemon recalled 17% of all its pants for being too sheer. At that point, the company blamed the manufacturing error on an incomplete testing protocol.

This is not the first time Wilson has publicly criticized the brand since he left the company's board in 2015.

He slammed the company's succession plan after CEO Calvin McDonald, compared its trajectory to a ""plane crash"" and a ""sinking ship."" 

In December, he launched a proxy fight to shake up the company leadership. As the largest shareholder, he nominated three new board members of his choosing.

If Wednesday was Trump day at the World Economic Forum, then Thursday was all about Elon Musk.

Musk, the world's richest person, made his first-ever appearance at Davos, taking the stage in conversation with Larry Fink, the WEF's cochair.

We're bringing you live updates from Musk and the rest of Davos here. Follow along for the latest.

Elon Musk once called Davos ""boring af."" After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him. 

The billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details.

The CEOs of three major banks — Citi, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs — made clear their feelings about plans to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. 

Their feelings: pretty negative.

The bond vigilantes could make a comeback soon.

That's the big message Citadel CEO Ken Griffin thinks the US got this week.

Speaking to Bloomberg on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Griffin pointed to the sharp sell-off in Japan's bond market as investors balked at a potential pause on food taxes, a policy proposal that caused the nation's 40-year government bond yield to hit a record high.

Speaking of Trump's journey home, Air Force One took off from Zurich Airport at 5:37 p.m. local time (11:37 a.m. ET). 

Trump's convoy was seen earlier driving away from Davos before Elon Musk's speech. 

Speaking of Trump's journey home, Air Force One took off from Zurich Airport at 5:37 p.m. local time (11:37 a.m. ET). 

Trump's convoy was seen earlier driving away from Davos before Elon Musk's speech. 

From touchdown to take off, the president spent about 29 hours in Switzerland.

With Musk's appearance over and Trump on his way back home, we're coming into the final stretch of the 2026 World Economic Forum. Private events and cocktail parties will continue long into Thursday night, but there are only a handful of talks and discussions left today, and just a few more scheduled on Friday morning. 

Things will officially wrap up with closing remarks from the WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning at midday tomorrow.

In his 30 minutes onstage, there wasn't a whole lot from Musk that we haven't heard before. He talked about his vision for a robot-powered future, plans to go to Mars, and the rollout of Tesla's robotaxis. 

Whether he has any further engagements at Davos is currently unclear.

""I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,"" he says.

""For quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than being a pessimist and right,"" he says to laughter.

""I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,"" he says.

""For quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than being a pessimist and right,"" he says to laughter.

And with that, Musk's first time at Davos comes to an end.

""People ask me do I want to die on Mars, and I'm like 'yes, but not on impact.'""

""The rate at which AI is progressing, I think we might have AI that is smarter than any human by the end of this year, and I would say no later than the end of next year.""

""Tesla has rolled out a robotaxi service in a few cities, and it will be very widespread by the end of this year within the US,"" he says.

Musk says Tesla hopes to get approval for its robotaxis in Europe next month. He doesn't specify where.

""Humanoid robotics will advance very quickly. We do have some of the Tesla Optimus robots doing simple tasks in the factory,"" Musk says.

""By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, but still deployed in an industrial environment,"" he adds.

""Humanoid robotics will advance very quickly. We do have some of the Tesla Optimus robots doing simple tasks in the factory,"" Musk says.

""By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, but still deployed in an industrial environment,"" he adds.

""By the end of next year, I think we'll be selling humanoid robots to the public. That's when we are confident that it's very high liability, very high safety, and the range of functionality is high.""

Musk said in 2024 that he wanted to sell Optimus in 2026.

""I do think it is a very solvable problem,"" he says.

""When we figure out what causes ageing, I think we'll find it's incredibly obvious.""

""I do think it is a very solvable problem,"" he says.

""When we figure out what causes ageing, I think we'll find it's incredibly obvious.""

Stopping aging isn't necessarily a good thing, he adds.

""There is a reason we don't have a longer life span. There is some risk of an ossification of society, of things getting locked in place.""

""We will actually make so many robots and AI that they will actually saturate human needs.""

""My prediction is that there will be more robots than people.""

""We will actually make so many robots and AI that they will actually saturate human needs.""

""My prediction is that there will be more robots than people.""

""Who wouldn't want a robot to, assuming it's very safe, watch over your kids, take care of your pets?""

""If we have ubiquitous AI, which is essentially free or close to it, and ubiquitous robotics, then you will have an explosion in the global economy that is truly beyond all precedent.""

""And I say, I am one, but they don't believe me. If anyone would know if there were aliens among us, it would be me.""

""I heard about the formation of the peace summit. And I was like, is that piece? A little piece of Greenland. A little piece of Venezuela,"" Musk says after Fink mentions Greenland.

Not many laughs for that one.

""That was not a large applause. Start again,"" Fink tells the audience.

Yesterday, President Donald Trump was on the agenda for 45 minutes, and ended up speaking for nearly 90 including his brief Q&A with WEF President Børge Brende.

Lots of smiles and small talk. Like a bunch of kids happily discussing their summer plans on the last day of school.

And why shouldn't they? After all, for many, the crisis had already been averted over the past 24 hours. A Greenland deal was cut, and many were feeling optimistic about the future.

Speaking @wef in 20 mins. What should I say? 🤭

Humanoid robots can do kung-fu and parkour. But can they make your morning coffee?

At a Davos panel on Thursday, moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, three robotics experts said humanoid robots needed to move beyond flashy demos and perform useful tasks in the real world at scale.

Jake Loosararian, the CEO of infrastructure startup Gecko Robotics, said that deploying robots into real-world environments was the major challenge facing the much-hyped industry.

""Open offices in Ukraine. Yes, a little bit of a risk, but we decided to be honest today,"" the Ukrainian president said to some laughs.

""Give jobs to our people.""

""Open offices in Ukraine. Yes, a little bit of a risk, but we decided to be honest today,"" the Ukrainian president said to some laughs.

""Give jobs to our people.""

""This is real support: jobs, money, investment.""

As he left the stage after his speech, he got a second standing ovation from the Davos crowd.

""Today we met with President Trump. Our teams are working every single day. It's not simple. The documents ending this war are nearly there and that really matters.""

Hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin has a blunt message for anyone expecting artificial intelligence to instantly rewrite the global economy: the hype is real — and it's there to justify enormous spending.

Speaking in Davos yesterday the Citadel CEO said the AI boom is being fueled as much by narrative as by real productivity gains. Griffin, the world's 39th richest person, said that doesn't mean AI isn't powerful — but expectations have run far ahead of reality.

A previous speech, given by Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, overran significantly.

Zelenskyy met with President Donald Trump prior to his speech.

Photos show the presidential motorcade heading down the mountain and out of Davos just before 3 p.m. local time.

Flight-tracking data shows Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 has reached Zurich. It landed at 2:22 p.m. local time, some 10 hours after departing San Jose.

Zurich is 75 miles from Davos, where Musk is scheduled to speak at the World Economic Forum at 4:30 p.m. (11:30 a.m. ET).

Zelenskyy is due to speak in roughly 20 minutes.

Despite being probably the most prominent figure in the world of business over the past decade, today's appearance will be Musk's first in Davos.

He has a difficult history with the conference, having frequently criticized it in the past, famously calling it ""boring af"" ahead of the 2023 edition. That incident sparked the WEF into publicly saying it had not invited Musk since 2015.

Elon Musk's private jet is back in tracking range, flying over France and about 200 miles from Zurich.

For much of the past week, Musk has been locked in a war of words with Michael O'Leary, CEO of Europe's biggest airline Ryanair, over Starlink.

Elon Musk's private jet is back in tracking range, flying over France and about 200 miles from Zurich.

For much of the past week, Musk has been locked in a war of words with Michael O'Leary, CEO of Europe's biggest airline Ryanair, over Starlink.

Perhaps ironically, Musk's jet earlier crossed paths with a Ryanair flight from Madrid to Dublin, which passed behind it by about 70 miles, with their flight paths intersecting roughly 10 minutes apart.

During their spat, Musk and O'Leary called each other idiots and Musk polled X users on purchasing the airline and installing a new boss named Ryan.

Then, on Wednesday, the Irish airline used the beef to promote its January sale and said it would hand-deliver a ticket to X's Dublin offices. Musk is yet to reply.

After the massive buzz around Trump's speech yesterday, things are a little lighter in terms of big name speakers at the World Economic Forum on Thursday. Still, it's Davos, so even a light day would be the envy of pretty much any other conference on earth.

The day's main event, of course, is Elon Musk's appearance at 4:30 p.m. local time (10:30 a.m. ET), but other highlights include a special address from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at 2:30 local time (8:30 ET). Zelenskyy, who initially planned to skip Davos this year, will also meet Trump while he is in Switzerland.

Continuing our coverage of coat rooms across Davos, I was turned away from Cloakroom A in the Congress Center today.

""We're only taking white badges today. Sorry.""

Continuing our coverage of coat rooms across Davos, I was turned away from Cloakroom A in the Congress Center today.

""We're only taking white badges today. Sorry.""

White badges are the top dogs in Davos' weird caste system, having access to basically everything. That's followed by silver (government officials), orange (media-types like me), black (security), and finally hotel badges.

There was a free coat room for us non-white-badgers just around the corner. But that didn't stop some from feeling offended.

I heard one attendee who was turned down muttering ""discrimination"" under his breath.

After leaving the Congress Hall, Trump thanked onlookers, but didn't take questions from reporters.

It looks like Elon Musk is heading to Davos on his Gulfstream G650 private jet — the model of choice among the very wealthy. When I was tracking private jet arrivals on Monday, it was the most frequent type, representing 31 of 157 landings at nearby airports.

According to JetSpy data, G650s that have landed near Davos this week include ones owned by: Aramco, Bill Gates, BlackRock (twice), Blackstone, The Carlyle Group, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Google, and ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin, Larry Ellison, and Mark Zuckerberg also own G650s, per JetSpy.

None of Europe's three largest economies, Germany, the UK, and France, will be signatories to the board today.

In an interview with the BBC from Davos this morning, British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said that this was in part due to ""concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace when we still haven't seen any signs from Putin there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine.""

Though Trump's centerpiece appearance at Davos was his 70-minute-long speech yesterday afternoon, the president is back onstage this morning.

He's launching his Board of Peace, alongside other world leaders, including Argentine President Javier Milei and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Elon Musk's private jet is somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean as he makes a last-minute trip to Davos.

The Gulfstream G650 took off from San Jose International at 7:12 p.m. PT. About six hours later, ADS-B Exchange data had it some 2,200 miles away from Zurich.

The Gulfstream G650 took off from San Jose International at 7:12 p.m. PT. About six hours later, ADS-B Exchange data had it some 2,200 miles away from Zurich.

The airplane was last recorded traveling at 660 miles per hour, which means it should land in Switzerland before 2 p.m. (8 a.m. ET). Davos is then about a 40-minute helicopter ride away.

We don't know for sure Musk is on the jet, but it seems highly likely.

Unlike President Donald Trump, who was delayed yesterday due to a fault with Air Force One, Musk should have plenty of time to get to Davos on time.

There has been no shortage of protests at the World Economic Forum this week, with anti-billionaire, environmental, and anti-war demonstrators seen in the town.

One of the more creative demos we've seen, however, is this snow-based slogan. If you can't quite read it, it says: ""NO IMPERIALISM.""

David Sacks spoke on Wednesday at the USA House alongside Michael Kratsios, the White House's director for science and tech policy. He pushed back on the most alarmist interpretations of Elon Musk's warnings about AI and jobs, arguing they strip out a crucial part of Musk's broader vision.

According to Sacks, Musk isn't predicting a sudden mass-unemployment crisis so much as a radically different economic system, closer to a ""Star Trek""-style world where technology supplies basic needs.

I've usually thought of Davos as being more dominated by finance and blue-chip companies, but clearly, tech has taken over.

Walking down the main thoroughfare in Davos is always fun because all the shops that are open the rest of the year are taken over this week by companies that host ""houses"" to showcase their brands and host clients and events.

Walking down the main thoroughfare in Davos is always fun because all the shops that are open the rest of the year are taken over this week by companies that host ""houses"" to showcase their brands and host clients and events.

Walking along the street this year, it seems like 80% of the houses are tech. Palantir and Meta (with its free hot chocolate stand) had the most visible presence. Amazon's house was surprisingly small. Google was far away from the main action. Lightspeed was the only venture capital firm I saw, with its odd retro ""Lighthouse.""

It is also interesting to see who is not here. OpenAI has no house, and Sam Altman did not come, though some executives are here. Elon Musk was not originally part of the program but was a last-minute addition today.

There were so many techies here that sometimes I felt like I was in San Francisco.

I asked a couple of startup founders why they came so far to be here, and the consensus was that there's nothing like Davos for the efficiency of meeting potential customers and investors who are all packed into a tiny Swiss village for the week.

Waiting in the cold in a long line for a party for General Catalyst and Lightspeed, I asked one founder why he traveled here.

He told me Alexandr Wang, founder and former CEO of Scale AI, who is now Chief AI Officer at Meta, advised him that Davos was highly useful because Wang said last year he signed almost a third of Scale's customers in the short time he was there.

Harvey cofounder CEO Winston Weinberg told me that dealmaking started even before I arrived, with many transactions happening in the business-class sections of flights to Zurich from San Francisco and New York.

Jamie Heller, Business Insider's editor in chief, led a panel on smart factories that dove into the future of physical AI and what's needed before robots become mainstream in homes and factory floors.

One phrase dominated her conversation: digital twins. Execs from Siemens, Agility Robotics, and Automation Anywhere agreed that what once sounded like a possibility in the distant future is now delivering real productivity gains.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom spent most of his 30-minute interview at Davos with Semafor's editor in chief slamming President Donald Trump and the administration. The US is living under ""the rule of Don"" rather than the rule of law, Newsom said.

""Co-equal branches of government, the rule of law, popular sovereignty,"" he said. ""Tell me that that reflects the America you read about today.""

Management is a bug, not a feature, in a career path at Cisco.

Jeetu Patel, Cisco's president and chief product officer, is a big proponent of the great flattening. In fact, if you're only managing people at Cisco, you're doing something wrong.

He called the philosophy ""foundational"" to Cisco. People need to think about how they want to change the world and what they can do to contribute to that change, rather than focusing on specific job titles.

""If in the pursuit of that change, you have to go out and reluctantly manage some people, then go ahead and do that,"" Patel said. ""But management, in and of itself, is not a full-time job.""

JPMorgan's co-CEOs of EMEA took a two-week trip across Europe and the Middle East to meet with clients at the start of the year. It corresponded with escalating geopolitical situations in Venezuela and Greenland, making for a unique trip.

When I spoke to them on Wednesday morning, before Trump's speech, they told me clients aren't necessarily looking to pull the plug on things, but the questions are mounting.

""I think it's just raising the spectre of uncertainty, so clients aren't making any definitive assumptions at this stage,"" Hillery told me. ""In the back of their heads, they are starting to think that this could get a lot more complicated than it's been for the last few years.""

And even since the trip, the situation is evolving almost minute by minute.

""There is a bit more of a question mark now compared to the first two weeks of January,"" Wiltz added.

There was a bit of show-and-tell from the California governor at his morning session. He took out a set of red kneepads, which he said are meant for the CEOs who kneel to Trump. He also accused some corporate leaders — he didn't name them — of ""selling out to this administration.""

No shortage of jabs at Trump, too. The governor called Trump an ""invasive species,"" among other things.

The reactions? Mixed. Business Insider was in the room for his speech, and we fact-checked the president's praise for the US economy.

And after all the panic over Greenland, Trump called off his new tariffs on Europe. There's to be a ""framework"" in place, per an agreement with NATO, with more to come on what that'll mean.

Ukraine's new defense minister has set a new goal for its forces to kill 50,000 Russian troops a month, a sharp increase from the losses that Kyiv says it's inflicting on the Kremlin now.

In a meeting with reporters on Tuesday, Mykhailo Fedorov said the new figure would be a core ""strategic objective"" for Ukraine.

""The objective is to impose costs on Russia that it cannot bear. In this way to force peace through strength,"" Fedorov said.

Notably, he specified only battlefield fatalities.

The new standard comes as Russia intensified its offensive in some areas of the front lines last year, aiming to take key cities such as Pokrovsk. The nature of its operations — often reliant on continuous high-casualty infantry attacks — has led to political discussion in recent months that the Kremlin may soon reach a point where it will lose more soldiers than it can recruit.

Ukraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in December that his forces had, for the first time, killed and wounded more Russian soldiers in one month than the Kremlin had called up for the same time period.

Fedorov, who was confirmed in his role last week, said on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops are already documenting 35,000 kills every month via video.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte cited another figure while speaking in Brussels on January 16, saying that 20,000 to 25,000 Russian troops were dying every month.

While differing significantly, both figures indicate that Russia is fighting the war at a high cost.

Rutte said the death rate has become ""unsustainable"" for Russia, and contrasted it to the Soviet Union's losses during the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, when an estimated 15,000 Soviet troops died over nine years.

Likewise, Fedorov expressed hopes that ramping up a focus on lethality will exhaust Russia's war machine.

""If we reach the figure of 50,000, we will see what happens to the enemy. They treat people as a resource, and problems with that resource are already obvious,"" he said.

Russia does not disclose how many of its troops are wounded or killed during the war. However, international and Ukrainian analyses say the number is likely tracking past 1 million people over nearly four years of war.

The UK's defense ministry said in early January that the Kremlin may have suffered at least 1.2 million total casualties, which includes both wounded and deceased, since February 2022.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin has relied largely on hefty sign-up bonuses to attract local contract soldiers, though it's also been found to sustain troop levels through other means, such as by recruiting from prisons or hiring foreigners via informal channels.

Some of those strategies may be waning. On Tuesday, the Russian independent media outlet Vertska reported that contract soldier sign-ups were slowing in some areas of the country.

Data from an unnamed source in the Moscow mayor's office, it wrote, showed that the capital had seen a roughly 25% annual drop in recruitment in 2025.

It's unclear how Fedorov intends to specifically target increasing combat kills. He said in his opening remarks to Ukrainian lawmakers last week that he intended to divert more staffing to drone units. Drones are thought to be responsible for roughly 70 to 90% of casualties inflicted during the war.

His new objective also comes against the backdrop of the US attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. Many of the Kremlin's latest war actions, such as attempts to take Pokrovsk, have been seen in Ukraine as efforts to posture into a position of strength.

At 32, Fedorov is Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister. He's begun his new appointment with promises of aggressive reform of the military's structure and how it distributes resources to its fighters.

Fedorov was previously Ukraine's minister for digital transformation.

Correction: January 22, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misstated the number of Soviet troops estimated killed during the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.

I refuse the long arm of the government's reach into my refrigerator: I'm not drinking whole milk!

And I readily accept that food is political, so the fact that the latest dietary guidelines from the US government — which say to drink whole milk instead of skim — are being seen as the latest political battle isn't a surprise.

But there's something in the latest whole milk debate that is truly confusing to me. It's that … whole milk isn't very good? And I don't think many of us have felt we couldn't drink it because of government guidelines. We just don't like it!

Secretary of Health and full-fat dairy booster Robert Kennedy Jr. is a polarizing figure, so people are going to interpret this kind of video in a way that fits their worldview:

🥛 pic.twitter.com/QUeSfR7EC8

The government is positioning this change as people being desperate to drink whole milk but feeling they weren't allowed to. That they were forced to settle for skim or 2% milk, and finally, thanks to the Trump administration, are allowed the verboten pleasures again.

Whole milk is too sludgy, too thick. It always kind of smells like it's on its way to turning sour. I find the white residue it leaves on the sides of a glass off-putting.

Yuck.

One-percent milk is crisp, drinkable, watery, cold, and refreshing.

Great to drink on its own or as a bath for cereal. Personally, I think skim is too watery, and 2% too close to whole, but I accept those options as well.

For me, it's not any fear of fat intake that has kept me from buying whole milk; it's that whole milk is stinky and gross.

I should note here that the health benefits of whole vs. low-fat milk are a living, breathing debate. Whole milk has more saturated fat, which is potentially ""bad,"" but it has more vitamins and enzymes or whatever, which are potentially ""good."" (Disclaimer: I'm not a scientist here, people! Don't trust me — do your own research.)

If you're truly interested in learning more about the details of the health benefits of dairy, I suggest you read this instead of listening to me whine about my personal milk preference. Don't listen to me about healthy food choices; my doctor shook her head sadly and said ""noooooo"" when I told her what kinds of garbage I typically eat for dinner (yes, my cholesterol is high).

For me, worrying about the milkfat content of my cereal is like worrying about which multivitamin brand to buy when I often go days without eating a fresh vegetable. I'm stuffing so many chemicals and processed garbage down my gullet on the reg that any kind of milk is the healthiest thing I'll consume by far.

Like whole milk? Know that I see you, I accept you, and you are valid. It's fine to have a taste preference.

But I simply don't believe there are throngs of adults out there who've been feeling forced to choke down 2% when they were dying for whole milk. You're a grownup! Buy whatever milk you like!

Of course, the main point of the latest guidelines isn't really aimed at making suggestions to adults. The actionable part of the guidelines is that they inform the rules for federal food programs for kids, like the National School Lunch Program, which previously only allowed low-fat milk options.

I don't really care if a kid prefers whole or skim milk with their sloppy Joe or PB&J — either option seems better to me than chocolate milk, which, according to my own elementary school children, is what everyone chooses at lunch anyway.

If the government is going to start meddling more with school lunches, frankly, I'd welcome them to start with the abusive fee structure in some of the digital lunch payment systems that many districts have adopted. My kids' school uses a payment provider for lunches that charges a $3.50 fee every time you add money to your kid's account (and requires separate accounts per sibling). President Trump, please look into that.

For me, I am not going to change my milk-drinking ways. I was raised in a 1% household. I will continue to buy 1% because it's delicious, and whole milk is gross, and Uncle Sam can't tell me what to do.

In this article

President Donald Trump sued JPMorgan Chase and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, on Thursday for closing his and related entities' accounts in early 2021 after decades of being customers of the bank, allegedly for political reasons.

The closures came on the heels of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by Trump supporters at the U.S. Capitol, and the president exiting the White House later that same month after his electoral loss to former President Joe Biden was confirmed.

""Plaintiffs are confident that JPMC's unilateral decision came about as a result of politicaland social motivations, and JPMC's unsubstantiated, 'woke' beliefs that it needed to distanceitself from President Trump and his conservative political views,"" the lawsuit alleges.

""In essence, JPMC debanked Plaintiffs' Accounts because it believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so,"" says the suit, which was filed in state court in Miami-Dade County, Florida.

The suit says that JPMorgan's ""reckless decision is leading a growing trend by financial institutions inthe United States of America to cut off a consumer's access to banking services if their political iews contradict with those of the financial institution.""

JPMorgan, in a statement to CNBC, said, ""While we regret President Trump has sued us, we believe the suit has no merit.""

""We respect the President's right to sue us and our right to defend ourselves - that's what courts are for,"" said the bank's spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler. ""JPMC does not close accounts for political or religious reasons.""

""We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company. We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so,"" Wexler said.

""We have been asking both this Administration and prior administrations to change the rules and regulations that put us in this position, and we support the Administration's efforts to prevent the weaponization of the banking.""

BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder's star is rising as a potential Federal Reserve chair following flattering remarks Wednesday from President Donald Trump.

In a CNBC interview, Trump called Rieder ""very impressive"" following a recent meeting between the two. Rieder is one of a few finalists in the race to see who will succeed current Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in May.

Trump also indicated that he is near a decision, with a candidate field that began at 11 now whittled ""down to maybe one,"" the president said during the interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Following his comments, traders on the Kalshi predictions market raised the odds for Rieder getting the nomination to 33%, about double where they were at the beginning of the week. Rieder did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh continues to hold the lead at 45%, but that's down about 14 points from Monday.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led the candidate screening, told CNBC earlier this week that he expects Trump will announce a decision next week.

—Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship.

Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has accused Europe of being ""lost"" and trying to convince U.S. President Donald Trump to help them, rather than uniting to defend itself.

""Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost trying to convince the U.S. president to change,"" he said in a strongly worded address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, after nearly four years of war with Russia.

""President Trump loves who he is, and he says he loves Europe, but he will not listen to this kind of Europe,"" Zelenskyy said. He had met Trump in private shortly before his speech.

""Europe still feels more like geography, history, a tradition, not a real political force, not a great power,"" Zelenskyy added.

""Some Europeans are really strong, it's true, but many say 'we must stand strong', and they always want someone else to tell them how long they need to stand strong, preferably until the next election.""

Zelenskyy also revealed there would be trilateral meetings in the United Arab Emirates on Friday and Saturday involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. He added the Russians ""have to be ready for compromises"" for the war to end.

In a week where the focus in Davos has been on U.S. threats to annex Greenland, its tariffs on European countries and a new Gaza ""Board of Peace,"" Zelenskyy began his speech saying Europe's inaction left his country feeling like it was living through ""Groundhog Day.""

Zelenskyy said: ""Just last year here in Davos, I ended my speech with the words, 'Europe needs to know how to defend itself.' A year has passed and nothing has changed. We are still in a situation where I must say the same words.""

""When united, we are truly invincible, and Europe can and must be a global force, not one that reacts late,"" he added.

Trump's maneuvering on Greenland was the backdrop to many politicians' speeches at the gathering. Zelenskyy criticized the small number of soldiers NATO countries sent to the Arctic island amid Trump's threats.

""If you send 30 or 40 soldiers to Greenland, what is that for? What message does it send? What's the message to Putin? To China? And even more importantly, what message does it send to Denmark?

""You either declare that European bases will protect the region from Russia and China .... or you risk not being taken seriously, because 30 or 40 soldiers will not protect anything.""

Other pressing issues have been sidelined while European leaders were ""waiting for America to cool down"" on Greenland, Zelenskyy suggested.

""There was so much talk about the protests in Iran, but they drowned in blood. The world has not helped enough the Iranian people,"" he said.

The future of the Warner Bros. Discovery company – its iconic movie studio, HBO Max, and its cable networks, including CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery and HGTV – may come down to what European regulators think about Netflix.

That's a pretty crazy twist for a deal that will dictate the future of many valuable American sports rights – assets that, for the most part, have very little to do with Europe.

A quick refresher: WBD owns many live U.S. sports rights, including those to March Madness, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, the French Open, AEW, the College Football Playoffs and others. But those rights wouldn't go to Netflix under WBD's agreed-upon deal to sell some of its assets to the streaming giant.

Netflix has agreed to pay $27.75 per share for the WBD movie studio and streaming business, but not the cable networks, which own the sports rights. If the deal is approved, those networks would get spun out into a separate publicly traded entity called Discovery Global, which would also own Bleacher Report, House of Highlights and WBD's other digital assets.

If WBD shareholders accept a hostile takeover attempt from Paramount Skydance, however – and if that deal is approved – the cable networks and associated sports would all fall under the Paramount umbrella. Paramount has bid $30 per share for the entirety of WBD – an offer it has taken directly to shareholders after the WBD board rejected it.

Paramount on Thursday extended the deadline on its tender offer — which expired Wednesday — giving WBD shareholders more time to weigh the option. 

WBD responded with a statement, noting that less than 7% of all shareholders have tendered their shares thus far to Paramount.

""Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix. It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme,"" WBD said. ""We are confident in our ability to achieve regulatory approval for the Netflix merger and look forward to delivering the tremendous and certain value our agreement will provide to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.""

Most media attention has focused on what U.S. President Donald Trump might think about a Netflix-WBD deal. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with Trump ahead of the deal to gauge his sentiment on a transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice — theoretically an independent body from the presidency – will ultimately decide whether or not the deal presents antitrust problems, and if those issues can be ameliorated with conditions or if they're simply too big for a deal to go through.

There's been far less attention paid to Europe, which will also need to approve a deal. And that's where either deal could fall apart. 

Netflix is a global company, generating about $14.5 billion in revenue in its ""EMEA"" (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region last year, or about 32% of total sales. 

WBD feels confident its Netflix deal will win EU approval, according to people familiar with the matter. A WBD source said there was a ""95% certainty"" that Europe would approve the transaction, though the person did acknowledge Netflix may need to agree to certain conditions, such as agreeing to produce a certain amount of local content in Europe and promising to release movies into theaters. The EU's Audiovisual Media Services Directive already mandates that video-on-demand streaming services ensure at least 30% of programming in EU countries qualify as European works. 

Paramount disagrees and believes a Netflix deal has very little chance of making it past European regulators, according to people familiar with the matter. At the same time, it's working its own EU regulatory angles for its proposed takeover.

It would be unusual but not unprecedented for European regulators to block a deal between two U.S.-based companies. Adobe dropped its $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma in December 2023 after deciding there was ""no clear path"" to gaining antitrust approval in Europe and the U.K. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority also forced Meta's Facebook to sell Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks, in 2022.

It's also worth noting the European Commission allowed Amazon to acquire MGM, perhaps the closest comparison in terms of comparative businesses to this deal.

Paramount's confidence stems from the continent's track record of being tough on tech companies, with antitrust crackdowns and penalties targeting Meta, Microsoft, Google, Apple and Amazon in recent years. Paramount executives believe EU regulators view Netflix similarly, based on recent conversations they've had with European officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Given the chance to stop a Big Tech company from gaining even more market power, Paramount executives believe Europe will take it.

The EU may also be more parochial in how it treats movie theater owners, viewing them as essential to culture and art. Both U.S. and European trade associations for the cinema industry have publicly expressed their displeasure with a Netflix-Warner combination.

This week, Sarandos reiterated that Warner Bros. films will be released in theaters with a 45-day window — as they always have.

""We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals,"" Sarandos said Tuesday during Netflix's earnings conference call. ""When this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled, world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business.""

The WBD board viewed two movie studios coming together – Paramount and Warner – as a bigger regulatory hurdle than any issue presented by Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, WBD's lawyers have determined both deals – Netflix-WBD and Paramount-WBD – would likely gain approval.

""The WBD Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the [Paramount tender] Offer with its regulatory advisors,"" WBD said in a December corporate filing. ""The WBD Board is of the view that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material.""

On the movie theater issue, a Warner source told me WBD actually views Paramount as a potentially bigger issue than Netflix. That's because WBD's board and executives aren't sure Paramount will have the money to produce 30 or more movies a year (a Paramount CEO David Ellison promise) while also paying down billions of dollars in debt and targeting $6 billion in cost savings. 

This is why the structure of the Paramount deal is so important to WBD. To create a superior deal for WBD, Larry Ellison, David's father and one of the world's wealthiest men, would need to put up more money in equity to lower the leverage ratio of a combined company. The board doesn't trust Paramount can deliver on its synergies while also meeting its aggressive theatrical goals and moving forward with a leverage ratio over 7-times estimated 2026 EBITDA.

This week, Netflix changed its offer for WBD's assets from mostly cash to all cash. Simplifying the bid allows WBD to move its shareholder meeting to approve the Netflix offer earlier – possibly as early as March, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Paramount is still considering if it wants to raise its bid or change the capital structure to re-engage the WBD board, according to people familiar with the matter. It could also do nothing and wait to see if it's right about regulators – either European or American – blocking a Netflix deal.

With so much attention on the importance of live sports to the TV industry, it's unusual to see them as such an afterthought. Paramount executives have argued the value of Discovery Global should be $0 based on its high leverage ratio and the early valuation of Versant, the parent company of CNBC, which has traded down almost 30% since it debuted on the public markets this month.

In a corporate filing released Tuesday, WBD argued Discovery Global should be valued between $1.33 per share and $6.86 per share, depending on estimates. 

Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Adobe dropped its $20 billion acquisition of cloud software company Figma.

Spirit Airlines is in talks with alternative investment firm Castlelake for a potential takeover as the discount airline looks for a path out of bankruptcy, CNBC has learned.

Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last August for the second time in a year after its previous turnaround plan fell flat. 

Fellow budget carrier Frontier Airlines had been in talks with Spirit over the years for a potential merger, including in recent months, but didn't secure a deal, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak about the discussions. The two had reached a deal four years ago but it was called off after a surprise all-cash offer from JetBlue Airways.

""We don't comment on market rumors and speculation,"" a Spirit spokesman said. Castlelake didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. 

It was not immediately clear if Spirit's bondholders and Castlelake would reach a deal or what form it could take. Minneapolis-based Castlelake has been active for years in aviation finance. In August, it announced it was launching a new aviation lending arm, Merit AirFinance, with $1.8 billion in deployable capital. 

Spirit in mid-December said it amended its agreement with creditors to receive another $50 million in funding immediately, a lifeline for the carrier. Additional funding would be contingent on ""further progress on a standalone plan of reorganization or a strategic transaction,"" Spirit said Dec. 15. ""Spirit is currently in active negotiations on each of these possibilities,"" the company added.

In its fight for survival, Spirit has slashed flights, reduced its fleet and cut jobs to save money. Unions last year agreed to pay cuts for the carrier's pilots and flight attendants. That amounted to $100 million in concessions, the Air Line Pilots Association said in a Jan. 13 open letter, urging bondholders to support Spirit's restructuring and avoid a liquidation.

Dania Beach, Florida-based Spirit for years enjoyed largely steady profitability and enviable margins in the often-rocky airline industry. But things took a turn after the pandemic, when wages and other costs soared, customer preferences changed, and an oversupply of domestic flights drove down airfare. That was especially punishing for U.S.-focused carriers that don't enjoy a buffer from plush first-class cabins and large credit card and loyalty program deals.

The carrier's problems snowballed after a Pratt & Whitney engine recall grounded dozens of its Airbus aircraft starting in 2023 and the planned acquisition by JetBlue was blocked two years ago by a federal judge who ruled it was anticompetitive, leaving both carriers to fend for themselves against a backdrop where larger carriers dominate.

Spirit has been trying in recent years to win over higher-spending customers by offering roomier seats or bundled fares that include seat assignments and baggage, or allow for changes, to better compete with larger rivals whose profits have been buoyed by big-spending customers post-pandemic.

In this article

DETROIT — General Motors plans to move production of a Buick compact SUV from China to the U.S. for domestic sales, the company confirmed Thursday.

GM said the next-generation vehicle is expected to be built at the automaker's Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas City, Kansas, beginning in 2028. The next-generation Buick compact SUV that will be built in the U.S. will be sold domestically, meaning production of the vehicle in China may continue as well for sales elsewhere.

The move comes as President Donald Trump has been pressuring companies to onshore production and as the relationship between the U.S. and China grows increasingly contentious, including with tariffs on vehicles. 

The Detroit automaker has produced the compact Buick Envision SUV in China for the U.S. since 2017. However, the company declined to confirm the name for the next generation of the vehicle that it will be moving stateside. 

""General Motors will onshore production of the next-generation Buick compact SUV to Fairfax Assembly in Kansas City, beginning in 2028. This decision further strengthens GM's domestic manufacturing footprint and supports U.S. jobs, building on $5.5 billion in new investments announced across our U.S. manufacturing sites in the last year,"" GM said in an emailed statement.

The compact Buick is expected to join production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox at the Kansas factory following limited production of the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt. Equinox production will start in 2027, GM said.

U.S. sales of the Envision have topped 40,000 for the past three years, representing roughly a quarter of Buick's sales during that time period.

GM's decision to produce the compact Buick SUV in the U.S. was first reported by Reuters.

Happy Thursday. With each passing day of the World Economic Forum, my envy grows for those spending the week in Switzerland.

Stock futures are higher this morning. The three major averages are coming off a positive session.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Stocks staged a recovery rally yesterday after President Donald Trump said that the U.S. wouldn't use military force to acquire Greenland. The president later announced that he reached a framework with NATO regarding the Danish territory, sending stocks even higher.

Here's the rundown:

The Supreme Court yesterday appeared skeptical of the Trump administration's argument that the president could fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, indicating that Cook's job could be safe.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh told Trump's team that the president's ability to fire Fed governors without judicial review ""would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve."" Justice Samuel Alito, a fellow conservative voice on the bench, said Trump's firing of Cook appeared to be done in a ""very cursory manner.""

Speaking of the Fed: Trump told CNBC yesterday that he was ""down to maybe one"" candidate to be the next central bank chair. Trump declined to name his favorite.

Trump called on Congress yesterday to adopt his plan for temporary 10% credit card interest rate caps into legislation. But JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon didn't mince words on the proposal, saying at a Davos event that ""it would be an economic disaster.""

Dimon suggested that Trump try out a version of the idea in Vermont and Massachusetts. While Dimon didn't name them, those happen to be the home states of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who both support a five-year, 10% cap on credit card rates. 

Dimon also issued a rare rebuke of Trump's immigration reform efforts while in Davos. ″I don't like what I'm seeing,"" the bank chief said, adding that he wanted details about who was being taken in Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

Procter & Gamble modestly beat Wall Street's earnings expectations in the second fiscal quarter this morning, but revenue narrowly missed analysts' consensus forecast. Shares slid 1.5% in premarket trading.

The Gillette and Downy parent said its net income fell from the same period a year ago but reported a 1% increase in net sales. The Ohio-based company lowered its outlook for fiscal 2026, citing higher restructuring charges.

Elsewhere on the earnings front, we're watching for reports from Intel and Alaska Air due today after the bell.

YouTube has a resolution for 2026: reduce ""AI slop"" on the Google-owned video platform.

In his annual letter published yesterday, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said managing artificial intelligence-generated content and detecting deepfakes are priorities for the platform this year. ""It's becoming harder to detect what's real and what's AI-generated,"" Mohan wrote.

As CNBC's Jennifer Elias reports, those comments come as Google continues to invest heavily in AI infrastructure while building out its Gemini models and adding more AI features to its products.

Intel surged more than 11% yesterday to its highest level since early 2022 as investors geared up for the chipmaker's earnings report coming this afternoon. Here's how the stock's day went:

U.S. President Donald Trump was surrounded by world leaders as he declared the war in Gaza was ""really coming to an end"" at a signing ceremony for his ""Board of Peace"" for the territory.

But many countries are not represented, and Trump singled out Spain for criticism on its defense spending from the podium, saying ""They want a free ride."" 

The United Arab Emirates, Hungary and Pakistan were represented at the ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday. The board is intended to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza.

This is who is on the board and participated in the signing event.

A long list of countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy and other European nations, were absent from the signing, and some have specifically rejected the invitation.

UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC on Thursday that it ""won't be one of the signatories today,"" citing concerns over Russian President Vladimir Putin's invitation to join.

Spain did not send a representative to the signing, with an invitation for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to join ""under review,"" according to Spanish media.

Putin received an invitation to join Trump's peace group on Monday and was ""studying all the details of this proposal,""  Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, but no representative was present at the signing event on Thursday. 

In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said the U.S. administration would meet Putin about joining the Board of Peace. ""We have to go meet him on Thursday. But it's the Russians who are asking for that meeting,"" Witkoff said.

France reportedly turned the invitation down to join the board, as did Germany, per a Spiegel report citing a Foreign Ministry document. ""We need more time,"" Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told state broadcaster RAI on Wednesday. ""There is work that needs to be done. However, my position certainly remains one of openness,"" she said, according to a Reuters report.

Belgium has not signed up either, its foreign minister, Maxime Prevot, said in a statement posted on X Thursday. ""We wish for a common and coordinated European response. As many European countries, we have reservations to the proposal,"" she said.

Sweden, Slovenia and Norway also turned the invitation down, according to local news reports.

The Board of Peace was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in November last year. It was originally established to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, but now has a far broader mandate, including promoting global stability and conflict resolution around the world.

Israel was not represented at the signing event, but its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will join, according to reports.

When asked about the board of peace on Wednesday, Mohammed Mustafa, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority, said: ""We want to work with the Board of Peace, with the executive board and with the committee, to ensure that they do their part of things.""

""But we also want to see our government institutions to continue to … prepare for a reconstruction effort,"" he said during a WEF event at Davos.

Last week the White House confirmed a founding ""Executive Board,"" to ""operationalize the Board of Peace's vision.""

These are the members of the Executive Board.

In this article

Alphabet's Waymo said Thursday that its robotaxi service is now open to paying riders in Miami, kicking off a 2026 market expansion.

Miami is the sixth market where Waymo offers driverless ride-hailing service, extending its lead over Tesla and Amazon-owned Zoox. As U.S. competition has lagged, Waymo's planned 2026 expansions could lock in rider demand and loyalty in the U.S.

To start, Waymo will offer its services within a 60-square-mile area that includes Miami's Design District, Wynwood, Brickell and Coral Gables neighborhoods, the Google sister company said. 

The company began testing its vehicles in the Florida city in early 2025. Waymo said it plans to extend its service to the Miami International Airport in the near future, but did not give a specific timeline. 

The company said ""nearly 10,000 residents"" of Miami have already signed up to try its robotaxi service, and Waymo will be ""inviting new riders on a rolling basis."" Riders can hail a Waymo robotaxi in Miami using the company's app. 

Waymo is partnering with mobility company Moove for fleet management services including vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs.

The Miami launch comes after Waymo has faced public concerns over the safety and driving behavior of its vehicles.

Waymo's vehicles contributed to gridlock during storms and widespread power outages in San Francisco last month. The company has been refining its systems to better navigate during such circumstances and weather, Waymo said afterward.

The company ended 2025 with its robotaxi service available in five major U.S. markets, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix and the San Francisco Bay Area.

For 2026, Waymo has said it plans to expand to more U.S. markets, including Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington and Nashville, Tenn. The company is also testing in New York, Tokyo and London, and has also said it will launch its first overseas commercial service this year.

In December, Waymo crossed 450,000 weekly paid rides, and the company said it had served 14 million trips in 2025. The company is in talks to raise $15 billion in funding, CNBC reported last month. 

The Alphabet company faces its most formidable competition from Baidu-owned Apollo Go and WeRide in Asia, but Amazon's Zoox and Elon Musk's Tesla, along with startups like May Mobility and Nuro, are aiming to compete with Waymo in North America.

In this article

Markets and some European leaders welcomed the news that U.S. President Donald Trump was standing down from imposing further tariffs on European countries — but others were left bewildered.

Trump told CNBC on Wednesday that he had the ""concept of a deal"" with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, shortly after declaring on Truth Social that he would not proceed with the levies he threatened on eight European countries from Feb. 1.

Markets on Thursday rose on the news, but questions remain about the supposed agreement on Greenland.

As the president didn't share details of the framework — or who agreed to it — one strategist told CNBC: ""Nobody's going to believe him anymore.""

Trump outlined the Greenland agreement in sweeping terms, casting it as an ""ultimate long-term deal"" that locks in U.S. national security and gives access to ""minerals.""

Greenland's location matters for Arctic military posture, but climate change is making the island more accessible — sparking a renewed interest in its rare earths and other critical mineral reserves.

But Trump did not say whether Denmark, which is responsible for the island's defense, or Greenland had signed up to anything.

Rutte told Fox News that the issue of Greenland's ownership did not come up in his talks with Trump, which were about Arctic security as Chinese and Russian activity increases.

Ed Price, senior non-resident fellow at New York University, told CNBC on Thursday that striking a deal ""requires two people to tango,"" describing Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, as ""a monologue not a dialogue."" 

Price also said the framework was ""the start of a process, not the end,"" warning that a precedent of bargaining over disputed territories could tempt future attempts elsewhere. 

Chinese state media, meanwhile, urged the European Union on Wednesday to reassess its security reliance on the U.S. and pursue greater ""strategic autonomy.""

Trump has ""advantaged"" China in the long run by signaling that U.S. commitments can swing wildly with political incentives, Price added. 

Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Trump's toned-down rhetoric had ""nothing to do with Europe"" and was more likely driven by concerns about the recent spikes in global bond yields, which jumped on fears of a fresh trade war.

Brooks also said Europeans had limited leverage in negotiations with Trump. 

""Europeans have, by all accounts, been freeriding on the U.S. security umbrella. They need to spend more. They will,"" Brooks said, caveating that most countries, except for Germany, lack fiscal space. ""A lot of these countries have no fiscal firepower whatsoever,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia.""

In his Wednesday speech at Davos, Trump acknowledged financial markets' discomfort with his threats over Greenland as he publicly ruled out using force to take it for the first time.

Whatever ultimately happens with tariffs, European leaders should plan for worst-case outcomes, said David Roche, veteran investor from Quantum Strategy. 

Trump's Greenland threat is ""the biggest 'taco' that you could get,"" Roche said, referring to the phrase ""Trump Always Chickens Out,"" which has come to define a market strategy anticipating the president reneging on his threats.

But Roche said this was becoming a problem — the bigger Trump's threat, the more allies expect him to ""march his troops up the hill and then down the hill.""

""What the European Union has learned is that if you face up to them, you win,"" Roche said. ""Nobody's going to believe him anymore.""

The EU needs ""clarity"" on Donald Trump's intentions after he cancelled his planned levies against eight countries over their stance on Greenland, a senior lawmaker has told CNBC.

EU lawmakers have removed the threat of tariff countermeasures against the U.S. after the U.S. president backed down.

Bernd Lange, a member of the European Parliament and chair of EU-US trade relations on its committee on International trade, said the bloc still needs ""greater clarity"" on Trump's intentions after he declared on Truth Social he had a ""framework"" of a deal between the White House and NATO late Wednesday. Trump later told CNBC he had ""the concept of a deal.""

""First of all, nobody knows exactly what the details of this so-called solution or deal are. We have to look to the details,"" Lange told CNBC by phone on Thursday morning.

""The decision about such a solution or deal should be taken by Denmark and the people in Greenland, not between two important men,"" he said, referring to the discussions between Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

""Let's see what the development will bring,"" he added.

On Wednesday, European lawmakers suspended approval of the trade pact agreed last July between the EU and U.S. after Trump unveiled plans last weekend to hit eight countries with fresh import levies.

European leaders planned to discuss potential responses at an emergency summit in Brussels later on Thursday evening, including countermeasures on some 93 billion euros ($108 billion) worth of U.S. imports that would have taken effect next month.

But after Trump canceled tariffs on eight European countries for opposing his bid to annex Greenland, saying he had ""the framework of a future deal"" over Greenland, tensions appear to have eased.

Lange said the EU's countermeasures to tariffs were ""not off the table, but on hold.""

""It's clear that this list of countermeasures, which is still legally there, is now not coming into force in February, because it seems that there will be no tariffs from the United States. So this will be put on hold as well... perhaps prolonged for some months,"" he said.

Despite Trump's apparent climbdown, EU leaders are set to push ahead with their planned emergency summit later.

Lange said: ""We will look to the assessment regarding this so-called Greenland solution, and secondly, we will contact our U.S. counterparts to get more clarity and security about respecting the deal on both sides.""

Top CEOs have expressed relief after U.S. President Donald Trump backed away from further European tariffs, but told CNBC they were still prioritizing being resilient amid geopolitical instability and regionalization.

Conor Hillery, JP Morgan's co-CEO for Europe, told CNBC European leaders' tougher stance on Trump was ""very good for business.""

Trump announced Wednesday that he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte had agreed on a ""framework of a future deal"" involving Greenland, and he would not proceed with 10% tariffs on eight European countries that had resisted his efforts.

European markets rebounded in morning dealmaking, with auto-related stocks notching the continent's biggest gains. European carmakers are particularly sensitive to levies given their global supply chains and Stateside manufacturing operations.

Speaking to CNBC on Thursday from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Hillery said European leaders' coordinated stance on Trump was ""something that business has been crying out for.""

""It's more cohesion among European leaders, more policy driven towards business growth, stability, innovation, investment and so forth. What you've seen over the last few days has obviously been more focused on Greenland and tariffs and so forth, and it has borne fruit,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

The president described the fresh framework as more of a ""concept"" in an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen. It could involve U.S.-European collaboration on a proposed Golden Dome missile defense system and access to mineral resources in Greenland, he said.

Geopolitical risk dominated Davos, after what Hillery called a ""roller coaster"" year since Trump returned to the White House.

""There still is a feeling of resilience and some kind of confidence"" in the macroeconomic and corporate outlook despite ""high degrees of anxiety about where the world is going,"" Hillery said. 

SAP CEO Christian Klein told CNBC that clients were still concerned about the businesses' ability to mitigate unpredictable geopolitical developments, as tariffs and regionalization came into focus. 

SAP is a global business but Klein said he felt ""bad"" for European startups because the continent lacks a digital union, making it more difficult for them to scale and become more resilient. 

Klein added European businesses could use AI to build wider moats, urging business leaders to take risks and the European Union to deregulate to unlock greater capital and talent.

Henrik Andersen, CEO of Wind energy company Vestas, told CNBC that the company has localized its supply chain, challenging Trump's claims that China is selling the green energy infrastructure, such as windmills, that it doesn't use domestically.

""We have factories that produce, in most major markets, turbines for that market based on local components. If we look at how we source, [it's] either in the U.S. from U.S. partners, or we source in Europe from European partners, and even in Denmark from Danish partners, we are both a global and a national source of components to turbines, and everything produced in China just exported to the rest of the world, is not again, a fact of life,"" said Andersen.

Before Trump backed down on tariffs, Wolf von Rotberg, equity strategist at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, said markets ""have come around to understand three things about Trump.""

""His initial proposals and demands are always an opening gambit. They are often as aggressive as they could be… He does not really chicken out, but his strategy requires him to retreat from his maximalist position over time.

""While his rhetoric may sometimes suggest the opposite, Trump actually takes very calculated risks.

""He is very much focused on markets and on getting the best deal possible. Investors have learned to look through the noise and to understand that Trump is as sensitive to falling stock prices as they are.""

Bitcoin payments startup ZBD raised $40M to expand blockchain payment infrastructure for games, focusing on Bitcoin rewards and integration.

Bitcoin payments startup ZBD has raised $40 million in a Series C funding round as it looks to expand blockchain-based payment infrastructure for the video game industry, Fortune reported.

The New Jersey–based company, which provides payments software for game developers, was led in the round by Blockstream Capital. The crypto investment firm contributed $36 million, according to cofounder and CEO Simon Cowell, who spoke with Fortune. 

Cowell declined to disclose the company's valuation or name the other investors involved.

The platform allows video game developers to integrate payments directly into games, enabling transactions such as peer-to-peer transfers, loyalty rewards, and Bitcoin payouts without relying on third-party fintech providers.

 “We're talking about a payment solution for the entire industry that actually really enables them to have a direct financial relationship to the player,” Cowell said.

The fundraise comes at a time when enthusiasm for crypto gaming has cooled. 

Once touted as a major use case for blockchain technology, crypto-based gaming — particularly NFT-driven models — has struggled to gain mainstream traction since the 2021–2022 bull market. 

ZBD has deliberately avoided NFTs and crypto-native gameplay, instead focusing on payments, an area that has seen more concrete adoption, especially as stablecoins gain attention from firms like Stripe and banks including JPMorgan Chase, according to Fortune.

Founded by Cowell alongside André Neves and Christian Moss, ZBD centers its technology on Bitcoin rather than stablecoins. 

However, the company positions itself as a broader payments provider, allowing developers to keep users within their ecosystems rather than routing transactions through external services.

While the startup is not yet profitable and declined to share revenue figures, Cowell said the company worked with 55 games in 2025 and currently employs about 70 people. 

The newly raised capital will be used to expand ZBD's payments product suite over the coming year, Fortune reported.

ZBD integrated Bitcoin rewards into TapNation's mobile game Idle Bank last year, marking the first mainstream mobile game to deliver Lightning Network payouts, which boosted 30-day player retention by 355% and revenue per player by 124%. 

The company, originally testing Bitcoin rewards with a modded Counter-Strike server, developed an SDK and API that allow game developers to seamlessly add Bitcoin rewards while addressing cybersecurity and fraud concerns. 

ZBD's model turns ad revenue into Bitcoin payouts for players, increasing engagement and monetization, and has already driven significant growth for games like Bitcoin Miner.

Now open in D.C.'s Penn Quarter neighborhood is what some have described as a “Bitcoin bar,” but for PubKey co-founder and CEO Thomas Pacchia, he said it's much more than that.

“I bristle a little bit whenever we're described as a ‘Bitcoin-themed bar.' Bitcoin is much more so in the DNA of the organization,” he said. “You can think of us as a media company with a hospitality wrapper.”

This is the second location of PubKey, with the first in New York City's Greenwich Village, which opened a little over three years ago.

The space in D.C. is bigger than the original location and includes a glass-enclosed podcast and video studio, a stage for live events, plus private karaoke rooms. In the rear of the space is also the headquarters for the Bitcoin Policy Institute, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that researches Bitcoin and other “emerging monetary networks.”

Customers don't need to own Bitcoin to enjoy PubKey, and it is possible that a guest could overlook the Bitcoin references found within the space, which was formerly home to a Hill Country Barbecue Market. The look of PubKey taps into the nostalgic comforts of dive bars with wood-paneling, vintage-looking portraits, beer ads and a neon Budweiser sign.

Looking closer at the details, PubKey isn't hiding its mission, though. Inside, there is an LED display showing the real-time price of Bitcoin in U.S. dollars. Nestled in one corner is a framed, printed tweet from President Donald Trump when he posted, “We will end Kamala's war on crypto, & Bitcoin will be MADE IN THE USA!”

PubKey also hosts a variety of events, workshops and meetups each week focused on Bitcoin.

The menu also includes references to crypto-slang like the “Orange Pill Whale” cocktail. This is in reference to those who are significant holders of crypto who passionately evangelize the cryptocurrency's value, while trying to “orange-pill” (or persuade) others into understanding its importance and worth. This cocktail is only served to those able to pay $100 worth of Bitcoin.

When it comes to how Bitcoin transactions are done at PubKey, Pacchia said he uses the point-of-sale system, known as Square, which began integrating Bitcoin as a method of payment this past year. Certainly, PubKey accepts cash and card payments alongside Bitcoin, but customers who do use the cryptocurrency get a 21% discount. No other cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin is accepted at PubKey at the moment.

While Pacchia said, “We've become sort of a central cultural hub for Bitcoiners,” he emphasized that PubKey is “not exclusively for Bitcoiners. It's for everybody.”

While not necessarily a ubiquitous payment method, Bitcoin may eventually be a more popular option. The cryptocurrency launched in 2009 and is now worth nearly $100,000 per BTC (at the time of this article's publication).

Currently, 7% of the transactions at PubKey's New York City location are via Bitcoin, according to Pacchia. And there are estimates that cryptocurrency payment users in the U.S. are expected to jump by approximately 82% from 2024 to 2026.

In August 2025, Trump signed an executive order that cleared a path for alternative assets — including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin — to be offered more broadly across traditional retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans.

Critics like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, though, have noted the volatility of Bitcoin.

“There is ample reason to think these investment options will make things worse by increasing the risk of large losses for participants, most of whom can ill afford them,” Warren said.

Pacchia said he knows Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general can be “a little bit off-putting” for some people, which is why he finds the term “Bitcoin bar” to be “a little bit of a prickly term for me.”

“I don't think that there has been a critical enough dive into the reality of the situation,” he said, adding that he hopes PubKey and the Bitcoin Policy Institute can “help set the record straight.”

He told WTOP that “Bitcoin has a bit of a mind of its own,” and that while there has been volatility in its worth, “If you zoom out and look at it in the long run, it's unbelievable what it's accomplished.”

When it comes to the future of Bitcoin, Pacchia said he believes Bitcoin transactions will eventually become ubiquitous. 10 years from now, he said, people will look at Bitcoin the way people in the past looked at the internet or electricity. He argued that Bitcoin shouldn't be a partisan issue because “it's just a tool.”

In the end, whether you're a critic or already “orange-pilled,” Pacchia said there's a place for everyone at PubKey.

“With PubKey, what we provide is a light-hearted, accessible place that people can come and engage with people that work in Bitcoin, that are enthusiasts of Bitcoin, that are skeptics, and they can have a normal debate over a couple of beers, the way it's supposed to be,” Pacchia said.

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin said he's moving fully back to decentralized social media platforms in 2026, with his words coming right as the two biggest players in the space—Farcaster and Lens Protocol—have changed hands.

In an X post, the outspoken founder highlighted the need for better mass communication tools, calling for a move beyond “everyone constantly tweeting inside a single global info warzone.”

“We need mass communication tools that serve the user's long-term interest, not maximize short-term engagement,” said Buterin. “There is no simple trick that solves these problems. But there is one important place to start: more competition.” 

In 2026, I plan to be fully back to decentralized social.

If we want a better society, we need better mass communication tools. We need mass communication tools that surface the best information and arguments and help people find points of agreement. We need mass communication… https://t.co/ye249HsojJ

— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 21, 2026



“Decentralization is the way to enable that: a shared data layer, with anyone being able to build their own client on top,” he added. 

Buterin's remarks came after Lens Protocol, the social platform built by the development team behind Ethereum DeFi protocol Aave, announced on Tuesday that Mask Network would “steward the next chapter” for the decentralized protocol. 

On Wednesday, Farcaster made a similar announcement, detailing that its protocol smart contracts, code, the Farcaster app, and its acquired token launchpad, Clanker, will all be transferred to Neynar—a longstanding Farcaster client and infrastructure firm.

“This wasn't an easy decision. Farcaster and the people building on it mean a lot to us,"" posted Farcaster co-founder Dan Romero on X. “We're proud of what our team built, and what the community built alongside us. But after five years, it's clear Farcaster needs a new approach and leadership to reach its full potential.” 

That new approach will come less than two years after the platform raised $150 million in a Series A which valued the company at $1 billion and sought to expand its active user base and developer primitives. Farcaster's team recently said that it would pivot focus towards wallet development after the “social-first” approach failed to maintain momentum.

While neither platform currently has a native token of its own, Buterin claims that most crypto social projects have inserted something speculative and considered it innovative.

“Too often, we in crypto think that if you insert a speculative coin into something, that counts as ‘innovating,' and moves the world forward,” he posted. The real focus though, he said, should be on solving for the actual social aspect of social media.

“Decentralized social should be run by people who deeply believe in the ‘social' part, and are motivated first and foremost by solving the problems of social,” Buterin added.

For the new leaders of Lens, that means a focus on “consumer-grade execution, product design, and global distribution.” For Farcaster, it is a new “builder-focused vision” that is expected to be shared soon. In both instances, the original teams will step away from day-to-day operations.

Oops, something went wrong

Investors pulled nearly $1 billion from exchange-traded funds tracking the spot price of Bitcoin and Ethereum on Wednesday, seeking refuge from cryptocurrency exposure as U.S. President Donald Trump struck a new chord in his approach to acquiring Greenland.

The president said on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday afternoon that he had “a framework of a deal” regarding the Danish territory, as well as the Arctic region, following talks with NATO secretary Mark Rutte.

Along those lines, Trump abruptly backed away from threats to impose tariffs on European nations that stood in opposition of his bid for the semi-autonomous island. Not long before, he also ruled out the use of force during his address in Davos, Switzerland. Markets rebounded following his comments after falling into the red Tuesday amid tariff uncertainty.

On Thursday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen signaled that she was receptive to Trump's about-face, but she said in a statement that “we cannot negotiate our sovereignty,” pushing back against Trump's assertion that the U.S. must own the territory for national security.

The developments had all the making of a “TACO” situation, short for “Trump Always Chickens Out.” The acronym was coined last year in reference to Trump's habit of announcing massive tariffs as a pressure tactic, only to reverse course once global markets begin to dip.

Investors yanked $709 million for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. on Wednesday, the biggest single-day bleed since Nov. 20, according to CoinGlass. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs shed $287 million. However, the snapshot does not include flows from products listed in Europe.

New Bitcoin Whales Outpace Old Guard in $6B Supply Tug-of-War

In a Thursday note, Jasper De Maere, a desk strategist at crypto market maker Wintermute, said Trump's pivot removed “some immediate geopolitical overhang that was driving the earlier selloff,” but “macro risk remains elevated” despite any stabilization in Bitcoin's price.

Bitcoin and Ethereum dipped indeed. Recently changing hands around $89,000, Bitcoin was down 7.5% over the past week, while Ethereum had fallen 12% to $2,950 over that same period of time, according to CoinGecko. Last week, they notched their highest prices in more than a month.

“Bitcoin is acting like a high-beta and risk-on asset, trading very similarly to equities,” Carlos Guzman, a research analyst at crypto trading firm GSR, told Decrypt. “Bitcoin is not acting as a store of value. It's not yet digital gold in investors' minds.”

CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill noted in a recent report that sentiment toward digital asset investment products soured last Friday, as diplomatic tensions flared. Still, the products generated $113 million in net inflows last week among investors in Europe.

Ethereum Sentiment Flips Bearish as Traders Brace for Drop to $2.5K

Analysts at investment bank Compass Point have linked Bitcoin's recent route to jitters among short-term holders, who are typically more sensitive to price swings. They identified the $98,000 mark for Bitcoin as a key threshold for rallies in that respect.

What's more, hopes regarding the passage of a crypto market structure bill have been dashed by Coinbase, which withdrew its support from the bill. The White House still expects the bill to pass, which Wintermute's Da Maere described as a short-term catalyst.

“Seeing participants pull out their support of that bill, I think that just added to the pessimism this week,” GSR's Guzman said. “There was a lot of optimism.”","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Tokenization means turning real-world assets such as U.S. Treasuries or investment funds into digital tokens that live on a blockchain, and BlackRock's Ethereum tokenization has become a central theme in this shift. In its report, BlackRock said Ethereum supports about 65% of all tokenized assets. That dominance helps explain why firms, and not only BlackRock, racing into tokenized stocks and funds keep choosing Ethereum instead of starting from scratch on new chains.

The network's recent surge in activity further underscores this shift, with daily transactions reaching an all-time high of 2.885 million on January 16, 2026. This record-breaking volume, up from averages around 1.2 million in 2025, reflects growing on-chain demand from stablecoins, layer-2 solutions, and tokenized products, even as some activity was linked to address poisoning scams.

BlackRock's own tokenized Treasury fund, called BUIDL, shows how this works in practice. The fund now holds nearly $2 billion in assets under management as of January 2026, including tokenized U.S. Treasuries, and pays yield directly on-chain. Launched in 2024, BUIDL has grown steadily, distributing around $150 million in dividends to date across networks like Ethereum and BNB Chain.

Why BlackRock says Ethereum is Wall Street's tokenization backbone? ETH acts like a shared financial highway. Banks, funds, and fintech firms can all plug into the same network instead of building closed systems. That openness explains why even competitors like Franklin Templeton and Ondo Finance build around Ethereum.

You can see similar momentum in tokenized stock infrastructure, where Ethereum-linked tools keep showing up. The network's established smart contract capabilities and vast developer ecosystem make it the go-to choice for secure, scalable token issuance.

Ethereum's price has shown resilience amid broader market movements in early 2026. As of January 22, ETH trades around $3,000 USD, up about 1.3% in the last 24 hours but down roughly 7% over the past week following a peak near $3,300 earlier in the month. Year-to-date, it's up around 2%, with a market cap exceeding $360 billion.
This consolidation follows a strong close to 2025, where ETH gained 25% in the final quarter, driven by institutional interest and upgrades like Fusaka, which boosted capacity and reduced fees to as low as $0.04 per swap.

The transaction all-time high aligns with increased on-chain metrics: daily active addresses hit a three-year peak of 1.03 million on January 16, and new wallet creations surged to 450,000 on January 11. These figures indicate broader adoption, with stablecoin transfers accounting for 35-40% of activity and staking reaching 36 million ETH locked (about 30% of supply).

Spot Ethereum ETFs have seen robust inflows, reflecting Wall Street's growing embrace. For the week ending January 16, 2026, ETH ETFs attracted $479 million, the highest since October 2025, with BlackRock's ETHA leading at $219 million. Year-to-date inflows total around $585 million, pushing total assets under management for ETHA to $10.7 billion.

However, flows turned mixed recently, with a $239 million outflow on January 20, including $101 million from BlackRock's fund. Despite this pause, the overall trend remains positive, supported by BlackRock's outlook. Combined with Bitcoin ETFs drawing $1.42 billion in the same week, these movements highlight sustained demand for blockchain exposure.

More tokenized assets mean more activity on Ethereum. Activity matters because users pay fees in ETH, similar to paying tolls to use a busy road. If Wall Street keeps issuing funds and assets on Ethereum, demand for block space rises.

BlackRock's Jay Jacobs framed Ethereum as a direct beneficiary of this shift. The idea is simple: More assets. More transactions. More economic weight flows through the network.

That narrative also explains why institutions like Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are entering tokenized money markets. As tokenization scales, potentially reaching $80 billion by year-end per Bernstein estimates, Ethereum's role as the settlement layer could drive further value accrual, benefiting holders through increased fees and network utility.

AI is still leading the pack of high growth sectors in crypto. So today, we look at 3 gems from this fast growing sector. They include one small cap where you can get in early, a midcap, and a large cap.

So today, we look at some AI gems. Let's check them out!

Bluwhale is a 2-sided AI marketplace. This means they are attracting everyday users like us on one side and developers on the other side. Developers can get whatever resources they need from models to computing power to whatever. And then the user side works like an App Store but instead of apps, you're getting autonomous AI Agents to do tasks for you.

In the Agent Store, and you can see some of the listings here, there is a big focus on DeFi.



There's a Staking Agent to show where to get the best, safe yield staking your tokens. Or the Stablecoin Yield Agent does the same for your stablecoin holdings.  

There's also a Perps Trading Bot and a Cross Chain Aggregator so you get a good deal when you have to bridge coins across chains.  You can see how practical these agents are from casual users all the way up to traders and degens.

And key to this marketplace, like a decentralized Apple App Store, the developers list their agents and then anyone can deploy them. Users get what they need and the developers get paid. Everyone wins.

Here's what the front of the Agent Store looks like. All you have to do is



Bluwhale makes it very easy and user-friendly to do all this. And agents can make money while you sleep.

Bluwhale has 2 tokens. The main $BLUAI token, which we are talking about here. They also have the $BLUP Points token, which is a reward token for the community. 

$BLUAI launched in October. And we know how Q4 was for the market…..

Yet the token is now up 19% in the last 30 days to 55/100ths of a cent. With a market cap of only $6.8 million, this is a small cap and by far, the smallest one on our list today. One of the few areas where we think small caps can still grow and become blue chips is in AI. And Bluwhale has the pieces to be successful AND you are early.

You know Virtuals as the AI Agent launchpad on Base.

One of their new agents is one of their most interesting. It brings AI agents and DeFi together. The Wasabot is the first trading/DeFi bot agent from the Wasabi Protocol to go live on Virtuals. And it means access to $1.3 billion of trading volume and real yield for users.

Live on Virtuals Protocol: Wasabot is the first and only agent from @wasabi_protocol, offering onchain exposure to an ecosystem with $1.3B+ trading volume and $30M+ TVL.

One of the first agent-native DeFi protocols on @base, unlocking leverage and yield for the entire agentic… https://t.co/i5bcTAWmlt pic.twitter.com/reIRgim2Pu

— Virtuals Protocol (@virtuals_io) January 8, 2026

This is a trend we see only growing from here as DeFi is already a success in crypto but needs to grow. And AI Agents offer the convenience of not having to search 35 protocols across 12 chains to find the best yield for your stablecoins. Expect to see more of this.

After bottoming out in mid-December at 64c, $VIRTUAL has been on a nice run up 50% to over $1 at $1.06. The entire market suffered from the October 10th liquidation through the end of the year. Yet, January is already looking brighter for VIRTUAL, AI generally, and the market.

Next, we have Render. Render is one of our favorite AI projects because it hits on what most believe is the highest demand area of AI.

GPU computing power.

One of the reasons AI is not growing even faster is the lack of computing power. These AI models use up A LOT of computing power while doing their calculations, speculations, writing, or image rendering.

As you can guess from the name, Render started by harnessing GPUs for image rendering models like Midjourney or Nano Banana. (like this one)

Nano Banana smart prompt:

Photo-grid tribute poster design

— AmirMušić (@AmirMushich) January 7, 2026

And Render does focus on images and the AI needs of creatives instead of being just a general GPU marketplace.

Main integrations include Blender for 3D model creation and Unreal Engine, which is popular for its amazing graphics for games.

While images and graphics do eat up GPU computing power, Render is not exclusive to these markets. General AI including modeling and inference and machine learning projects use it, too.

The Render token $RENDER was on Polygon and is now on Solana. Nearly all of its total supply or 518 million out of 533 million are in circulation.

We like that.

$RENDER had a tough 2025, as did the entire market, and it was down 66% in the last 12 months. That said, it's up 61% just in the last 30 days. It's like the calendar turned over from 2025 to 2026 and people started remembering that some projects, including Render have value.

Render has pretty decent tokenomics and a strong place in one of the leading subsectors of AI. It's for these reasons we see this 30 day rise as just the beginning of what should be a bull run for this project.

The vision of a fully connected world is rapidly becoming a reality through the Internet of Things (IoT)—a growing network of physical devices that collect and share data over the Internet, including everything from small sensors to autonomous vehicles and industrial equipment.

To ensure this data is secure and not tampered with, engineers are increasingly turning to blockchain as a promising solution. While often associated with cryptocurrencies, blockchain is essentially a decentralized digital ledger; instead of one company controlling the data, it is shared and maintained collectively across a network of computers.

Unfortunately, existing blockchain systems can be too slow for the split-second decisions required in real-world IoT environments. The primary cause of this sluggishness is not the blockchain protocol itself, but the disorganized way the nodes within peer-to-peer networks communicate.

Most previous research has ignored how the overarching shape of these connections—referred to as the ""network topology""—impacts speed in IoT-blockchain systems.

To address this knowledge gap, a research team led by Associate Professor Kien Nguyen from the Institute for Advanced Academic Research/Graduate School of Informatics, Chiba University, Japan, investigated how to streamline operations in IoT-blockchain networks.

Their study, published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, examines the impact of different network topologies on performance and introduces a new method to keep data moving efficiently.

""We aimed to bridge the gap between theoretical design and practical deployment of IoT-blockchain systems by identifying the fundamental causes of their high latency and proposing a decentralized solution that is both simple and effective,"" says Dr. Nguyen. The study was co-authored by Koki Koshikawa, Yue Su, and Hiroo Sekiya, all from Chiba University.

First, to understand the root cause of the delays, the researchers implemented a method to generate different network topologies and connect simulated blockchain clients. After analyzing various representative cases, they showed that the decentralized nature of IoT networks often leads to redundant data transmission.

Specifically, they found that the current protocols for sharing ""transactions"" (the individual data entries) and ""blocks"" (the larger bundles of verified records) can cause an exponential increase in data copies. This results in network congestion and queuing delays, particularly when nodes are connected in a way that creates too many overlapping paths.

In response to this problem, the researchers developed ""Dual Perigee,"" a lightweight and decentralized algorithm that allows each node to intelligently choose its preferred ""neighbors"" in the network.

Instead of sticking with a series of random connections, a node using Dual Perigee assigns scores to its peers based on how quickly they deliver both individual transactions and full blocks. If a neighbor is consistently slow, the node automatically disconnects and tries new peers. Over time, the entire network self-organizes into a high-speed configuration without needing a central controller.

After testing in a simulated 50-node IoT environment, the Dual Perigee algorithm reduced block-related delays by 48.54% compared to the standard approach used in the widely known Ethereum blockchain. It also outperformed state-of-the-art methods, such as the original Perigee algorithm, by over 23%.

Notably, the researchers achieved these gains without adding extra computational strain to the IoT devices themselves, as the algorithm relies on ""passive"" measurements of data that the devices were already receiving and requires only minimal calculations.

This work has significant implications across many technological fields. By minimizing the time it takes for a blockchain to confirm and share data, the system becomes responsive enough for time-sensitive tasks.

""The proposed decentralized latency-aware peer-selection mechanism can serve as a foundation for future blockchain platforms that support real-time, mission-critical IoT services, ultimately enabling more secure, responsive, and trustworthy digital infrastructures,"" explains Dr. Nguyen.

As IoT networks continue to grow in size and complexity, the need for decentralized, trustworthy means of communication will only increase.

The research team believes Dual Perigee could play a key role in the near future, as Dr. Nguyen says, ""Our approach can be applied to emerging IoT-based services that require fast and reliable data sharing, such as smart cities, smart homes, industrial monitoring, health care systems, and supply-chain tracking.""

The cryptocurrency ecosystem requires balance between enabling legitimate fraud recovery and protecting innocent parties. Parties can address fraud involving crypto effectively by providing courts with clear, accurate information about how blockchain technology works.

Cryptocurrency is being embraced by major financial institutions and is recognized as a legitimate asset class. But as with any technology, a small subset of bad actors has exploited its features.

This includes scammers who convince victims to invest in crypto fraud schemes or otherwise demand payment in cryptocurrency. Unable to identify the actual wrongdoers, victims may direct claims at cryptocurrency exchanges and users whose accounts plaintiffs allege—often without adequate proof—received some portion of the stolen funds.

This creates a challenging situation for courts, which are being asked to issue sweeping asset freezes based on technical assumptions that often don't reflect how crypto works. One of the most complex issues involves blockchain tracing—the process of analyzing data from the blockchain to determine the source and destination of cryptocurrency funds.

While tracing can be powerful early in a fraud investigation, its reliability becomes difficult to assess once funds reach centralized services. Many platforms operate pooled address architectures—similar to how traditional banks pool customer deposits rather than maintaining separate accounts for each customer—making it challenging to attribute transaction flows to specific users.

In 2024, cryptocurrency scams accounted for at least $9.9 billion in stolen funds. Crypto scams have grown an average of 24% annually since 2020, and an entire marketplace has developed supplying the infrastructure needed to perpetuate scams at scale.

Pig butchering scams exemplify this sophistication. In such instances, scammers build trust with victims over weeks or months through dating apps or social media. Once trust is established, they introduce fraudulent investment opportunities, encouraging victims to transfer funds, often in crypto, to a wallet address on the promise of fictitious returns. When victims attempt to withdraw their crypto from the scam wallet, they discover they can't, often losing their life savings.

Many scammers exploit cryptocurrency for the same reasons legitimate users value it: Transactions are final, cross-border transfers are efficient, and users can maintain privacy—features that also complicate recovery efforts.

As victims seek recourse, courts grapple with increasingly complex technical issues, increasing risks for users who find their funds frozen or accounts swept into litigation because plaintiffs are applying traditional asset-recovery instincts that don't translate effectively.

While cryptocurrency transactions are documented on the blockchain, the identities of participants and their locations aren't. This creates a cascade of problems for traditional legal remedies, including damages, restitution, constructive trusts, and attachment orders—all of which require identifying the wrongdoer and tracing the stolen funds.

Identifying the scammers is often impossible. And tracing is complicated. Cryptocurrency can be transferred to multiple wallets quickly. Scam proceeds may be split into smaller amounts and sent to different destinations, making the stolen funds difficult to track through numerous wallet hops. Once funds are transferred to a service—like crypto exchanges or, more concerningly, “unlabeled” services such as mixers that commingle cryptocurrency funds from multiple users thereby further obscuring traceability—the public loses visibility. It can be difficult if not impossible to verify that the cryptocurrency routed through a service's address is the same cryptocurrency that comes out.

Even proper tracing can be problematic. Tracing focuses on fund flow rather than account owners, meaning it may implicate innocent account holders who are scam victims themselves (and thus receiving small incentive payments from the scammers).

Cryptocurrency exchanges and innocent users have been pulled into litigation in two scenarios:

In both scenarios, exchanges may find themselves sympathetic to fraud victims while also being responsible for protecting their own users from wrongful account freezes.

The consequences of flawed tracing have materialized in several cases. In last year's Steinhardt v. albertAI.click, the plaintiff obtained a preliminary injunction requiring exchanges to freeze accounts associated with identified wallets. The tracing analysis was over-inclusive—it included the plaintiff's own wallet, which was temporarily frozen.

In Cohn v. Popescu, a case from 2024, an alleged scam victim obtained a preliminary injunction freezing certain accounts without evidence tying the account owners to the alleged scam. Innocent account holders were forced to prove their innocence to regain access to funds, effectively shifting the burden of proof onto parties with no culpability for the underlying fraud.

These cases and others like them illustrate a pattern. When presented with blockchain tracing, courts have found the evidence sufficient to secure preliminary injunctive relief. This may include situations where the proffered tracing falls short of industry standards—particularly when the tracing isn't challenged as is often the case. Moreover, these proceedings typically focus on the plaintiff's alleged harm, with less attention given to the potential impact on innocent users and exchanges who may be swept into the litigation.

Reputable exchanges, which work to comply with valid legal process while protecting user privacy, are also pulled into litigation through third-party subpoenas seeking account information. But exchanges that comply produce user information and potentially put both themselves and their users in the crosshairs when plaintiffs realize there's nothing to recover from the actual wrongdoers.

Courts need to thoroughly analyze any purported blockchain tracing before assets and users disconnected from alleged scams have their rights affected. When exchange platforms are involved, several steps can help.

First, insisting on a valid court order before freezing assets protects exchanges and users from improper requests. Second, seeking early discovery or an informal information exchange focused on plaintiff's tracing analysis helps ensure the court has accurate information. Third, involving an expert to perform independent tracing analysis can be valuable, as plaintiffs may be unfamiliar with common tracing pitfalls.

Exchanges may also seek to educate courts about their platforms to help resolve issues and avoid unnecessary disputes. Technology tutorials are instrumental in patent matters and may be similarly helpful in blockchain tracing cases.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink used the World Economic Forum stage to argue that tokenization needs to move from pilot programs to market plumbing and suggested that a shared blockchain standard could cut costs and even “reduce corruption,” a framing that immediately reignited the “which chain?” debate across crypto and specifically inside the Ethereum community.

Fink didn't name a network. But the combination of BlackRock's onchain product footprint and its own research positioning makes Ethereum the most natural candidate for the “one common blockchain” he alluded to, even if he kept it implicit.

Fink's remarks, delivered in the language of infrastructure rather than crypto evangelism, leaned heavily on the operational case for digitized assets and interoperable settlement rails.

“I think the movement towards tokenization, decimalization is necessary. It's ironic that we see two emerging countries leading the world in the tokenization and digitization of their currency, that's Brazil and India. I think we need to move very rapidly to doing that.”

He then pushed the argument beyond payments and into capital markets: “We would be reducing fees, we would do more democratization by reducing more fees if we had all investments on a tokenized platform that can move from a tokenized money market fund to equities and bonds and back and forth.”

The most provocative line was his call for standardization and the trade-off he implied comes with it. “[If] we have one common blockchain, we could reduce corruption. So I would argue that, yes, we have more dependencies on maybe one blockchain, which we could all talk about, but that being said, the activities are probably processed and more secure than ever before.”

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told the World Economic Forum he thinks the movement toward tokenization and digitization is necessary. We need to move very rapidly to doing that. With one common blockchain, we can reduce corruption.

— Ethereum Daily (@ETH_Daily) January 22, 2026



In the abstract, “one common blockchain” could be read as a generic appeal for shared rails. In practice, BlackRock's public-market crypto lineup and its tokenization work have concentrated around Bitcoin and Ethereum.

On the ETF side, BlackRock's flagship US spot products track bitcoin and ether — iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) — with ETHA launching in 2024 and now sitting in the center of the firm's public-facing Ethereum exposure.

On the tokenization side, BlackRock's first tokenized fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), debuted on Ethereum via Securitize in March 2024, making Ethereum the original issuance network for what has become one of the market's most closely watched institutional RWAs.

While BUIDL has expanded across multiple networks over time, the key point for Fink's “common blockchain” framing is that Ethereum has been BlackRock's default starting point for public-chain issuance, a meaningful signal in a market where “standards” tend to follow whoever already has the deepest liquidity, the broadest integration surface, and the most conservative counterparties.

The stronger tell came this week from BlackRock research rather than Davos soundbites. In its 2026 thematic outlook, BlackRock explicitly floats the idea of Ethereum as the infrastructure layer that collects the “toll” as tokenization scales. One slide asks: “Could Ethereum represent the ‘toll road' to tokenization?” and adds that stablecoin adoption may be an early proxy for tokenization “in action,” with “blockchains like Ethereum” positioned to benefit.

In the same section, BlackRock cites RWA data “as of 1/5/2026” and notes that “of tokenized assets 65%+ are on Ethereum,” underscoring the network's lead in today's tokenized-asset stack.

At press time, ETH traded at $3,005.

The whole world may be talking about AI nonstop right now, but that doesn't mean other tech segments are falling off. Some are actually outperforming. Blockchain ETF BLOK, for example, has significantly outperformed its ETF Database Category average over the last year. Could the tech ETF be one to watch in 2026, as well?

See more: Amplify ETFs Outpaces Industry Growth With 70% AUM Jump in 2025


The Amplify Blockchain Technology ETF (BLOK) actively invests in businesses that are leaning into blockchain technology. The fund charges a 76 basis point fee for its services. It launched almost a decade ago, in 2018. 

Despite its age, the fund has seen its performance spike in recent years. The blockchain tech ETF returned 31.8% over the last one-year period per ETF Database data. That beat its category average in that time, with the average coming in at just 16.36%. 

What's more, the fund didn't just benefit from 2025's kind returns for tech writ large. BLOK has also outperformed significantly over the last three years, returning 56.3% in that time, compared to 23.3% for its category average.

“While there have been many thematic ETFs to launch in the past five years, BLOK has established a strong track record,” said VettaFi Head of Research Todd Rosenbluth. 

How, then, does the fund invest? The blockchain tech ETF's prospectus emphasizes companies embracing “transformational data sharing technologies.” The prospectus defines the blockchain as “a peer-to-peer shared, distributed ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.”

That has led the fund to invest not only in traditional tech companies, but also other firms embracing the blockchain. Its top holding per ETF Database data, Galaxy Digital (GLXY), focuses on data centers and digital assets. It also invests in Bed, Bath, and Beyond (BBBY), which has shown a significant interest in blockchain.

Together, the strategy could make for an interesting tech ETF offering to watch this year. AI can empower blockchain development, with BLOK offering exposure to the knock-on effects without adding to concentration risk.

In hydroponics, nutrient film technique (NFT) has long been synonymous with leafy green production. But, new research shows NFT can also support fruiting crops with minimal system changes.

Editor's Note: This article originally appeared in the January/February 2026 print edition of Produce Grower under the headline “Rethinking a leafy legacy.”

In hydroponics, nutrient film technique (NFT) has long been synonymous with leafy green production. NFT delivers a shallow stream of nutrient solution directly to plant roots in narrow channels, minimizing waste and maximizing space efficiency. 

It's simple, water-efficient design made it a natural fit for crops like lettuce, basil and arugula: fast-growing, compact and low-maintenance crops that helped define NFT's role in modern controlled environment agriculture. 

But a shift is beginning. More growers are now considering NFT for more than just leafy greens. With compact fruiting crops and modest system adaptations, a broader future is emerging for NFT, one where strawberries, dwarf peppers and micro-dwarf tomatoes might find a home. 

At its core, NFT minimizes waste and maximizes space efficiency. These strengths made NFT the gold standard for crops with short cycles, shallow roots and minimal structural needs. 

Yet the same simplicity that made NFT ideal for greens also historically limited its crop diversity. Fruiting crops — with higher nutrient demands, longer crop cycles, larger roots and heavier weight — were often seen as incompatible. 

But with slight system tweaks, the potential is broader than once believed. 

In the CEA Innovation Lab at Virginia Tech, we evaluated micro-dwarf tomato cultivars in NFT systems originally designed for leafy greens. These compact, determinate plants, bred to stay less than 30 centimeters tall, proved exceptionally well-suited to the shallow channels. Their small size, early maturity and uniform fruiting made them easy to integrate into NFT's flow. 

Unlike traditional indeterminate tomatoes, micro-dwarfs required little pruning, trellising or canopy management. Once transplanted, they grew with minimal labor beyond monitoring and harvesting. Their tendency to mature all at once allowed for batch-style harvesting, fitting naturally into the production rhythms of NFT without overextending the system. 

In our trials, micro-dwarf tomatoes produced consistent yields, maintained a compact architecture and required few modifications. With the right crop selection, NFT can be far more versatile than previously imagined, offering growers a way to diversify without major infrastructure changes. 

Expanding NFT beyond leafy greens brings challenges. One vulnerability is its reliance on a recirculating nutrient solution. While efficient, this design can also facilitate rapid spread of root diseases like Pythium or Fusarium if pathogens enter the system. 

A single infection can quickly move throughout the setup, making sanitation and monitoring essential. 

Fruiting crops may also require slight modifications. Wider channels help accommodate increased root mass, and lightweight support structures can stabilize heavier plants. Growers must balance the benefits of diversification with the operational realities of managing more complex plant needs. 

Tomatoes are just the beginning. Across the industry, growers and researchers are experimenting with strawberries, dwarf peppers, edible flowers, health-focused herbs and nutrient-dense crops like watercress in NFT systems. 

At Virginia Tech, Kaylee South, assistant professor from the School of Plant and Environmental Sciences, has explored this potential, trialing edible flowers and culinary herbs in NFT systems to highlight their viability in research settings. 

This flexibility offers major advantages. Growers with existing NFT setups can trial new crops without overhauling infrastructure. 

Operations with limited space can diversify their offerings without increasing their footprint. Even schools and research centers are incorporating fruiting crops into NFT systems to create more engaging and diverse learning environments. 

Diversifying within NFT also helps growers meet shifting market demands. Offering fruiting crops alongside leafy greens allows operations to provide a wider range of fresh produce without requiring additional growing area, which is a significant advantage in competitive local markets. 

The industry is already responding to NFT's growing potential. Breeders are developing ultra-compact cultivars optimized for hydroponics, and engineers are refining channel designs to better support diverse crops. 

For fruiting and specialty crops, this often means wider or deeper channels that can handle greater root volume, smoother internal profiles that reduce clogging as roots expand and stronger channel designs that tolerate increased plant weight. 

In practice, this allows growers to better match channel dimensions and layout to specific crops, rather than relying on channel designs originally intended only for leafy greens. NFT is evolving from a single-purpose leafy green system into a flexible, modular platform. Growers can plug in new crops, adjust system parameters and expand their offerings without fundamentally changing the system's core principles. 

As demand for fresh local produce rises and available growing space shrinks, NFT's space efficiency will remain a critical advantage, but its versatility may become its greatest strength. The next chapter for NFT isn't about replacing lettuce; it's about what else can grow beside it. 

With the right cultivars, thoughtful system tweaks and close attention to system health, growers can unlock broader possibilities within familiar systems. 

Innovation doesn't always require building something entirely new. Sometimes, it starts with reimagining the tools already in hand, planting a different kind of seed and having the willingness to rethink what's possible.

Trove Markets' token fell 98% post-ICO; developers accused of rug pull.

On January 20, the native token of perp-DEX Trove Markets (TROVE) plummeted by 98% just minutes after the completion of its ICO — the FDV of the coin dropped from $20 million to $110,000.

In preparation for the launch on January 19, developers of the Solana project conducted a fundraising on Hyperliquid. The team surpassed their target of $2.5 million, raising over $11.5 million.

Massive rug pull in crypto — $TROVE just got exposed hard.

Devs ran an ICO on Hyperliquid, smashed past their $2.5M target and raised over $11M. Then, without warning, they launched the token on Solana instead and kept all the funds — no refunds, nothing.

— Hyperliquid Daily (@HYPERDailyTK) January 20, 2026

  

Following the ICO, Trove representatives announced they would retain $9.3 million to build the platform's infrastructure. This move was seen as a red flag, and the team faced sharp criticism from the community. 

Subsequently, the developers launched TROVE and within minutes executed a rug pull, seizing liquidity worth approximately $2.5 million. ICO participants did not receive refunds.

No new posts have appeared on Trove Markets' official page on X since the token's collapse.

Under the team's last post, on-chain researcher ZachXBT shared a photo of a person who introduced himself as one of the project's co-founders at the Token 2049 conference in October 2025.

A user named Fantardio suggested filing a class action lawsuit against Trove Markets. 

“My $20,000 investment […] was supposed to return $14,000 in USDC and $6,000 in TROVE. But due to the massive wipeout, I got back a total of $600,” said an affected investor. 

Earlier in January, former New York City Mayor Eric Adams was accused of a rug pull following the collapse of NYC Token.

Litecoin has always been crypto's steady hand. Fast, reliable, and rarely dramatic, LTC has earned its place as one of the market's longest-running payment coins. But lately, something subtle has been happening beneath the surface and long-time Litecoin holders have noticed it.

Whales are trimming LTC exposure. Not dumping it outright, just reallocating. And a growing portion of that capital is flowing into Remittix's ICO, where investors are chasing what they see as asymmetric upside rather than incremental gains. That shift says a lot about how the market is thinking heading into 2026.



Litecoin does exactly what it's supposed to do. Transactions are quick. Fees are low. The network is stable. For payments, it works. 

However, stability cuts both ways. Litecoin's price action has become increasingly predictable. It tends to move with the market, not ahead of it. When Bitcoin rallies, LTC follows. When the market cools, it drifts. For whales managing large portfolios, that profile is useful, but it doesn't deliver the kind of growth that justifies heavy new allocations.

In other words, Litecoin feels finished. Not dead, just fully priced.

Whales don't usually abandon assets they respect. They rotate. Yes, Litecoin's legacy is secure. But markets don't reward legacy; they reward timing.

With Remittix moving rapidly from presale to product launch, offering crypto-to-fiat payments at a global scale, it's becoming the kind of opportunity whales can't ignore. That's why Litecoin bags are getting lighter and why Remittix's ICO is starting to feel like a rotation worth paying attention to as 2026 approaches.

This isn't speculation for speculation's sake. It's a calculated move toward:

That's exactly why Remittix is showing up in the same conversations.

Remittix isn't trying to replace Litecoin, it's tackling a different layer of the payments stack. While Litecoin focuses on on-chain transfers, Remittix is building PayFi infrastructure that connects crypto directly to bank accounts worldwide. Users send crypto, recipients receive fiat. No exchanges. No FX surprises. No crypto education required on the other end.

That design dramatically expands the addressable market, especially for freelancers, SMEs and cross-border payments. What's accelerating interest is execution:

For whales, this matters more than hype. A live wallet and a fixed launch date turn an ICO into a measurable event, not a vague promise.

The reason “7x” keeps coming up isn't magic; it's math. Litecoin's market cap is already large. To 7x from here would require massive, sustained inflows across the entire market.

Remittix, by contrast, is still in its early phase. If adoption ramps as the PayFi platform goes live, price discovery happens fast, especially once liquidity, exchange listings and real transaction volume enter the picture.

That's the kind of setup whales look for:

It's not about abandoning Litecoin. It's about where new growth comes from.

This isn't a referendum on Litecoin's relevance. LTC still works. It will likely continue to be used. But its role has shifted into the “reliable infrastructure” category, similar to how Bitcoin functions as a value anchor.

Remittix sits in the growth infrastructure category, where usage, not just survival, drives valuation. That distinction explains why capital is rotating the way it is.



If you're holding Litecoin, the takeaway isn't panic, it's perspective. Litecoin offers stability. Remittix offers velocity.

As crypto adoption expands beyond traders into real payments, money movement and everyday finance, projects that connect crypto to fiat at scale are becoming the new focal point. Whales aren't betting against Litecoin. They're betting that the next leg of growth comes from somewhere else.

Not because Litecoin is failing, but because its upside is limited compared to early-stage utility projects with upcoming catalysts.

Litecoin enables on-chain payments; Remittix connects crypto directly to global bank accounts through its PayFi platform.

The full Remittix PayFi platform is scheduled to launch on February 9, 2026.

        Share    

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, central bankers, Coinbase, Ripple and banks clash over tokenization, a Bitcoin ‘standard,' CBDCs and stablecoin yields as crypto trades near record highs.

Tokenization is no longer a World Economic Forum Davos thought experiment; it is, in the words of Banque de France governor François Villeroy de Galhau, “the name of the game really this year,” promising “progress in global finance, delivery versus payments, [and] diminish of cost of financial transactions.”

Moderator Karen Tso opened the talk, held on Jan. 21, by recalling the early real-estate hype and noting that in 2026 “banks, asset managers, crypto players [and] other innovators have been quietly working on the innovation,” while the Trump family is “promising to bring real estate assets onto the blockchain and to tokenize Trump properties this year.” Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters argued the industry is now at “a major inflection point,” saying he has “no doubt” that “eventually all things will settle in digital, digitized form,” even if regulation across “60 plus regulators” dictates how fast that journey happens.

Euroclear CEO Valérie Urbain framed tokenization as an evolution of securities markets that can “reach out to a bigger range of investors” and “give access to finance to many more people,” explicitly tying it to financial inclusion. A joint pilot with Banque de France aims to tokenize France's commercial paper market, some “€300 billion… small enough to make sure that we can all learn the lessons and see how we can transpose this initiative in a broader sense.”

Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong pushed the access narrative hard, arguing tokenization's “most powerful part… is just democratization of access to investment in high‑quality products,” noting an “unbrokered” world of “about 4 billion adults who don't have access or any ability to invest in high‑quality assets like the US stock market or real estate.” He cast crypto as the birth of “a new monetary system that I would call the Bitcoin standard instead of the gold standard… a return to sound money and something that is inflation resistant” as democracies struggle with deficits and fiat inflation.

Villeroy de Galhau pushed back bluntly: “I am a bit skeptical… about this idea of the Bitcoin standard,” warning that “monetary policy and money is part of society” and that losing the public role would mean losing “a key function of democracy.” Money, he insisted, remains a “public‑private partnership,” with CBDC as anchor and “tokenized private money” strictly regulated or risk a “Gresham's law” dynamic where bad private money dominates transactions while CBDC is hoarded as store of value.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted just how far the first “poster child of tokenization” has already run: “stable coins… went from in 2024 $19 trillion of transactions… and 2025 is $33 trillion, so about 75% growth.” On Ripple's own XRP Ledger, he said, “tokenized assets… surged over 2,200% last year.” He argued the United States has shifted from being “pretty openly hostile” to crypto to electing a “much more pro‑crypto, pro‑innovation Congress,” with the industry pushing for “clarity… better than chaos” after Ripple's five‑year legal fight with Washington.

Armstrong used the stalled US “Clarity Act” and the ongoing stablecoin rewards fight to attack what he called lobbying efforts trying “to put their thumb on the scale and ban their competition,” insisting consumers should “earn more money on their money.” At the same time, he warned that offshore stablecoins and China's interest‑bearing CBDC mean that banning rewards would simply push activity abroad, undermining US and European competitiveness.

Villeroy de Galhau rejected the idea of a remunerated digital euro, calling “innovation without regulation” a recipe for “serious trust issues” and potentially “financial crisis… born of misleaded or dangerous financial innovations.” The public purpose, he said, is “to preserve the stability of the financial system,” and CBDC is “not intended to attack the banking system and its deposits.”

The panel repeatedly circled back to the global south. Winters warned tokenization could mean “a full dollarization” for some emerging economies, even as it delivers “serious cost savings on the cross‑border business.” Villeroy de Galhau noted some G20 emerging powers have openly argued “we should forbid cryptos,” a path he rejects as sacrificing innovation but which underlines sovereignty fears. At the same time, he pointed out that countries such as Brazil and India are already global leaders in fast payments with Pix and UPI, even if they remain cautious on on‑chain currencies.

Environmental concerns surfaced briefly. Asked whether blockchain tokenization can coexist with AI's voracious energy demand, Garlinghouse drew a sharp line between consensus models: “not all layer 1 blockchains are created equal,” stressing that proof‑of‑stake systems use “99.9% less energy than proof‑of‑work,” and that “most of the activity of stable coins today is on more power efficient blockchains” like post‑Merge Ethereum.

The debate in Davos unfolded against a market backdrop where Bitcoin trades just under the psychological six‑figure mark. As of Jan. 22, 2026, Bitcoin changes hands around $89,800–$90,000, roughly flat to modestly higher over the past 24 hours, with MetaMask data showing today's price at about $89,791, up 0.67% from roughly $89,195 a day earlier. Ether holds near the tokenization narrative it increasingly underpins: around $3,000 per ETH, with MetaMask listing $3,003.33 today, a 1.26% gain on the previous day's $2,965.92, while Bybit quotes $2,998.95 with a 24‑hour range between roughly $2,872 and $3,053. Tether's USDT, the largest stablecoin and de facto settlement rail for much of this ecosystem, trades almost perfectly on‑peg at about $0.9992, with a 24‑hour change of roughly +0.05%, a market capitalization near $186.9 billion, and reported daily volume just over $110 billion.

These numbers underscore the panel's central tension: a crypto market already operating at multi‑trillion‑dollar scale, while policymakers, bankers and builders wrestle—in public—over who ultimately writes the rules for the tokenized future.

  Calls for a digital euro increasingly invoke monetary sovereignty, often on the grounds that Europe must retain control over its payment systems. This column argues that this reasoning conflates two distinct elements within the monetary system: money and payments. Sovereignty has never depended on universal access to public money or control over payment rails, but on legal authority over the unit of account and the capacity of the central bank balance sheet to absorb risk. Private money anchored by public backstops is the historical norm. The main competitive challenge today arises at the level of broad money, where stablecoins compete with bank deposits rather than with cash or central bank money. In this context, the digital euro is best understood as a symbolic response to payment-system dependence and fiscal fragmentation, rather than a functional requirement for monetary sovereignty.

The European Central Bank's work on a digital euro has increasingly been framed as a matter of monetary sovereignty. In recent submissions to the European Parliament, a number of economists have argued that without a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), Europe risks ceding control over its monetary system to foreign payment providers, BigTech platforms, and private digital monies.
1

 These concerns deserve to be taken seriously. Yet, much of the current debate risks obscuring more than it clarifies.

This column makes two related claims. First, monetary history suggests that CBDC is not a necessary condition for preserving a public monetary anchor. Second, many sovereignty arguments rest on a category mistake: the conflation of money with payments.

The first claim follows directly from the historical record. Money has never been a purely public institution. Across centuries, it has taken the form of a hybrid arrangement, combining a publicly defined unit of account with privately issued instruments. Medieval Europe relied heavily on bills of exchange issued by merchant banks; early modern trade was settled through clearing mechanisms rather than sovereign coin; and 19th century free banking systems were dominated by privately issued banknotes anchored by convertibility into specie (Spufford 2009, Sargent and Velde 2002, Gorton 1988). Stability did not hinge on universal access to public money, but on credible public backing and enforcement of par value.

The modern monetary system continues this tradition. Bank deposits – private liabilities – are the dominant form of money, supported by deposit insurance, regulation, and lender-of-last-resort facilities. Even cash, often portrayed as the paradigmatic public monetary instrument, has played a limited economic role and has rarely functioned as the primary store of value (Goodhart 1988). Its apparent status as a civic institution reflects 20th century technology and habit more than any deep constitutional principle.

Recent financial crises reinforce this interpretation. In the global financial crisis, the euro area sovereign crisis, the COVID-19 shock, and the 2023 banking turmoil, stability was preserved not by flights into cash but by large-scale expansions of central bank balance sheets via issuance of reserves. Risk absorption occurred overwhelmingly at the wholesale level, with central banks intermediating liquidity and solvency support to private institutions. The decisive public function operated through balance-sheet backstopping rather than through retail access to public money.

Historically, access to central bank balance sheets has been broader than access to reserves. In the US, primary dealers gained access to facilities functionally equivalent to the discount window during crises – such as the Primary Dealer Credit Facility in 2008 and 2020 – despite not holding reserve accounts. Money market funds and other non-bank institutions were stabilised through dedicated facilities without ever receiving reserves directly.

A similar logic applies in the euro area. Access to the Eurosystem's balance sheet has long extended beyond institutions with regular access to reserves or standing facilities. During the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis, the ECB absorbed risk primarily through banks, but also through a widening set of collateral frameworks, targeted longer-term refinancing operations, and emergency liquidity assistance (ELA), which allowed national central banks to provide liquidity to institutions that would not normally qualify as monetary policy counterparties. More recently, market-wide interventions – such as the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) – stabilised a broad range of non-bank balance sheets without granting direct reserve access. As in the US, these arrangements illustrate that monetary sovereignty is exercised through discretionary balance-sheet expansion and crisis instruments, not through universal or permanent access to central bank money.

From this perspective, what matters for monetary stability and sovereignty is not retail access to central bank liabilities, but the capacity of the central bank to absorb risk and enforce par convertibility across private monies (Adrian and Mancini-Griffoli 2019, Reichlin 2025a, 2025b, 2025c).

Key issues for financial stability and monetary sovereignty arise in relation to privately issued forms of broad money, such as stablecoins. Stablecoins function as means of payment and stores of value for on-chain activity. It is at this level – where bank deposits currently dominate – that monetary competition will take place.

A lightly used, capped, and non-remunerated CBDC is unlikely to be the instrument that disciplines or displaces large-scale stablecoin adoption, particularly when stablecoins are embedded in global platforms and denominated in foreign currencies. To the extent that stablecoins pose a challenge to monetary sovereignty, this challenge arises in the domain of broad money and payment networks. It is therefore more credibly addressed through regulation of stablecoins – in relation to their reserve backing - than through the introduction of a retail CBDC (Reichlin 2025b, 2025d).

The second claim concerns the structure of the sovereignty argument itself, and the way it frames the policy problem. Many calls for a digital euro implicitly equate monetary sovereignty with control over payment instruments and infrastructures. This is a conceptual error. Money and payments are related but distinct components within the monetary system. ‘Money' refers to the settlement asset, and the unit of account – what has been transferred, and in what quantity, when payment has been made.  ‘Payments' refers to the means by which the transaction takes place – which might be an inter-bank transfer using existing banking infrastructure, or it might be a series of entries on a blockchain.

This distinction is not semantic. Europe can lose control over payment rails without losing monetary sovereignty, just as it can retain monetary sovereignty while relying extensively on private or foreign payment providers. The euro's unit of account is defined and enforced by law; its value is stabilised by the ECB's balance sheet; and par convertibility across bank deposits is guaranteed by regulation and public backstops. None of these pillars requires the ECB to issue a retail CBDC.

Many of the concrete concerns raised in the sovereignty debate – dependence on foreign card networks, dominance of BigTech wallets, data extraction through payment platforms – are therefore primarily payment system issues. They call for competition policy, regulation, interoperability mandates, and the development of European payment infrastructures. Addressing them through CBDC risks overloading a monetary instrument with objectives that properly belong to payments policy.

Seen in this light, the digital euro addresses a different, more institutional problem. In the euro area, monetary union without full fiscal integration creates a persistent legitimacy gap. As cash use declines, the visibility of public money diminishes, while crisis management increasingly relies on opaque balance-sheet operations. A digital euro can thus be understood as a symbolic and constitutional response to fiscal fragmentation, reaffirming the presence of public money in a digital economy.

This symbolic role should not be dismissed. Symbols matter in monetary unions. But it should not be overstated either. The deliberately constrained design of the digital euro – non-remuneration, holding limits, and intermediated distribution – signals that it is not intended to replace private money, enhance payment efficiency, or materially improve crisis management. Its contribution to sovereignty is therefore indirect and political rather than operational.

In conclusion, the case for CBDC as a prerequisite for monetary sovereignty is weaker than often claimed. History suggests that sovereignty ultimately rests on legal authority and public balance sheets, not on universal access to public money. Confusing money with payments risks misdiagnosing the problem and misallocating policy effort. For Europe, the digital euro may play a useful symbolic role, but the effective defence of monetary sovereignty will continue to depend on regulation, fiscal capacity, and the central bank's willingness to absorb risk when it matters.

While the original Bitcoin whitepaper mostly focused on the crypto network as a peer-to-peer digital cash system for decentralized payments, the narrative around the world's largest and most valuable crypto asset has evolved into more of a store of value rather than a medium of exchange over the past decade. This is where the “digital gold” nickname originated, as some believe that bitcoin can act as an apolitical base money for the digital age with a monetary policy that was “set in stone” when the network first launched all the way back in 2009.

As Larry Fink, the CEO of financial titan BlackRock, explained just last month, “Bitcoin is an asset of fear . . . The long-term fundamental reason you own [bitcoin] is because of debasement.”

While some view this digital gold narrative as a pivot from Bitcoin's original design, the reality is that the system's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was concerned with removing the trust required in central banks to not debase the currency in some of his earliest writings.

This may all sound great in theory, but the reality is that bitcoin has routinely been unable to act like its analog sibling in times of global economic turmoil. For example, the bitcoin price suffered one of the worst crashes in its history when COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic in early March 2020. Over the past week, bitcoin has also dropped roughly 10% amid increasing tensions between the United States and Europe over control of Greenland and the selloff in the Japanese bond market.

Last October, there was also a massive crash in the greater crypto market, including $16 billion in liquidations on leveraged positions, amid increased trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Of course, many of the liquidated positions were in crypto assets that are much more speculative and less credible than bitcoin.

Meanwhile, gold is up roughly 5% over the past week. In fact, gold massively outperformed bitcoin in 2025, despite the precious metal supposedly being the less speculative and volatile asset of the two. While bitcoin has seen increased institutional adoption from the likes of Ivy League university endowments, nation states, and the largest asset manager in the world, the reality is that central banks, most notably China, still prefer real gold over its digital alternative.

That said, the functional utility of bitcoin as something like digital gold still exists, as was shown by the recent flight from crypto exchanges in Iran to the base Bitcoin network. In addition to the local populations, there has been extensive reporting on nation-states like Iran and Venezuela using crypto to avoid economic sanctions imposed by the United States. While much of this activity is being usurped by stablecoins, these dollar-pegged tokens can also be easily frozen by their centralized issuers.

Of course, the current inability of bitcoin to act as a safe-haven asset does not mean it is destined to fail to achieve its long-term goals. After bitcoin crashed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it went on to enjoy a 4,000% price rise to the new all-time high of around $125,000 hit last year. The price has since settled back down in the $90,000 area, and it's unclear if the usual four-year cycles from the past will continue.

The fact that it still moves like a tech stock in times of increased economic tension is a sign that it is still early days for bitcoin, despite its market cap now being measured in the trillions of dollars. However, it will eventually need to start acting more like the digital gold it's touted to be if it wants to stand the test of time and become the basis of a new, digital monetary standard for the 21st century.

BySandy Peng,

Contributor.

On January 1, 2026, the People's Bank of China began paying interest on digital yuan balances held in user wallets. To some, it might have seemed like a small technical upgrade that was long overdue. Yet, it came with outsized implications: China has just made its central bank digital currency the first in the world to offer returns to ordinary holders.

As of the end of November 2025, the digital yuan has already processed over 3.48 billion transactions, totalling 16.7 trillion yuan ($2.38 trillion). By any measure, that is quite successful adoption. But that is just the baseline before the yield upgrade even took effect. Now, with interest-bearing status, the digital yuan is no longer just a payment rail, but rather it is a place to park money – and adoption from here is likely to accelerate.

Throughout the history of digital assets, we have mostly heard consensus messaging around interest-bearing CBDCs: the European Central Bank said no, the Federal Reserve said no, the Bank for International Settlements said no. Their position has been clear for many years – that CBDCs must function like digital cash, with no interest, and no exceptions.

And to some extent, their reasoning makes sense. An interest-bearing CBDC could potentially drain commercial bank deposits. It could trigger bank runs during financial stress, or it could fundamentally reshape how money flows through an economy. The ECB's FAQ explicitly states that no interest would be paid on digital euro holdings. The Fed's 2022 discussion paper warned against exactly this scenario.

But China saw the same risks and chose a different path, and a different future for the digital yuan. Starting from January 1, digital yuan wallet balances now function as liabilities of commercial banks under PBOC oversight – and they pay interest – marking the first time any CBDC worldwide operates in such a way.

Most Western policymakers designed their frameworks assuming everyone would play by the same rules. They have built consensus around non-interest-bearing CBDCs to protect commercial banking, warned about disintermediation risk, and moved cautiously. China watched, learned, and then moved in a different direction. The new approach splits the CBDC playbook in half: with Western orthodoxy on one side, and Chinese pragmatism on the other. One approach prioritizes financial system stability, the other prioritizes monetary control and international competitiveness.

Originally, the digital yuan was supposed to replace paper money, making the digital currency easier to use (through mobile apps like Alipay) than its physical version. The new upgrade now sets it on a path to compete with bank accounts – with an expanded suite of use cases (payments, salaries, cross-border corridors).

Looking back, the problem with the digital yuan was never about choosing the wrong path. The real issue was how M0 positioning – treating it as digital cash – locked it into low-frequency scenarios. DC/EP followed every rule about central bank issuance and sovereign backing, but following the rules made it restrained. Correct in theory, but limited in practice.

At the same time, M0 had to come first. The People's Bank of China built DC/EP on the BIS Money Flower framework, analyzing every dimension: issuing entity, digitalization, account structure, public access. One conclusion stood out – only cash had not been properly digitized yet. This was not conservative thinking, it was rigorous analysis that led to certain constraints.

M0 is cash – the bills in your wallet, the coins in your pocket. But cash exists to be spent, not stored. When China first designed the digital yuan, they built it as a digital version of exactly this. The technology was genuinely impressive – transactions could complete even without network access, a capability called ""dual offline payment"" – but that solves a problem most consumers encounter perhaps once a year, if ever.

The new shift is not throwing away the past – it is building on a proven foundation. Guoxin Securities' Wang Jian called it moving from ""digital cash 1.0"" to ""deposit currency 2.0"" – the point where digital yuan begins to have a potential crowding-out effect on existing forms of electronic currency.

Moving to M1 means the digital yuan now functions like demand deposits, not just electronic cash, with interest accrued directly within wallets. Within the new M1 system, new scenarios are also unlocked: wages, subsidies, and public payments flowing through digital rails. Cross-institutional and cross-system settlement are becoming even more robust, and deep integration with financial products and contract-based payments are now a big opportunity to build.

The technical capability was always there, paved on M0 rails. What is now changing with the M1 move is how useful the digital currency is actually becoming – with significant potential unlocked for the rest of the continent.

The domestic implications are one side of the story, but the more consequential part plays out across borders. Cross-border payments still mostly run on infrastructure designed decades ago – SWIFT messaging, correspondent banking chains, multi-day settlement windows. The system is slow, expensive, opaque, and increasingly tangled in geopolitical friction. Sanctions regimes, compliance requirements, and great-power competition have made the plumbing of international finance feel fragile in ways it did not ten years ago.

China has been building different alternatives over the past decade. The mBridge project, developed with the Bank for International Settlements and central banks from Thailand, the UAE, and Hong Kong, already processes most of its transaction volume in digital yuan. But mBridge requires participating countries to operate their own CBDC infrastructure – a high bar for economies that lack the technical capacity or institutional readiness. The interest-bearing shift opens a different door entirely. Cross-border trade is overwhelmingly B2B: businesses moving working capital across jurisdictions. When you talk to CFOs and treasury managers about what actually drives their decisions, three factors surface repeatedly: is my money safe? is this easy to integrate? and what is in it for my company?

Fund safety was never the sticking point. Digital yuan carries the full backing of the People's Bank of China – sovereign credit does not get more solid than that, and no commercial stablecoin can match it. Ease of use remains genuinely uncertain – integrating digital yuan into corporate treasury systems, accounting workflows, and banking relationships takes more than policy announcements. This is execution territory, and execution is where ambitious financial infrastructure projects tend to stumble.

Incentives are what the interest-bearing change addresses head-on. Working capital sitting in settlement queues now earns a return. For businesses running on thin margins – particularly SMEs in emerging markets where a few basis points on idle cash makes a real difference – the math shifts. Not dramatically, but enough to tip decisions at the margin – and the margin is often where adoption curves start to bend.

Hong Kong's role in this architecture is not incidental – it is load-bearing. For digital yuan to function internationally, it needs a jurisdiction that can translate between Chinese financial infrastructure and global standards. Hong Kong offers exactly that combination: a common law legal system familiar to international businesses, deep capital markets, established regulatory credibility, and proximity to the mainland that no other financial centre can replicate.

The LEAP framework Hong Kong introduced last year – consolidating digital asset regulation under a single authority with clear licensing pathways for stablecoin issuers – positions the city as the critical connector. Compliant stablecoins backed by offshore renminbi can serve as regulated on-ramps for international businesses – offering exposure to digital yuan settlement through a jurisdiction whose AML, CFT, and sanctions compliance frameworks they already understand. The LEAP framework still mandates full KYC requirements and real-time transaction monitoring, which means companies get the efficiency benefits of digital yuan rails without navigating an unfamiliar regulatory environment.

The phased approach emerging from policy discussions on the mainland follows this very logic. Initial pilots concentrate in the Greater Bay Area and select RCEP countries – Thailand and Malaysia seem to appear frequently in planning documents. From there, expansion follows across Belt and Road economies – eventually, a parallel network emerges alongside mBridge, one that accommodates jurisdictions without their own CBDC infrastructure.

Hong Kong is not the destination market in this vision – it is the translation layer – the jurisdiction where digital yuan becomes legible to the rest of the world.

Another interesting impact of the news is the debate between CBDCs and stablecoins' positioning. Interest-bearing CBDCs shift the competitive dynamics with stablecoins, though not in the zero-sum way some have assumed.

Stablecoins achieved adoption by offering what CBDCs could not: flexibility, speed, and accessibility across borders with minimal friction. Most stablecoins designed to date work across a range of DeFi protocols, settle instantly onchain, and operate with lighter identity requirements than any government-backed system. That combination drove growth in ways official alternatives have not matched.

But most stablecoins do not pay interest (notably the two biggest stablecoins by TVL – USDC and USDT) – and that gap is about to matter more now. Tether earned $10 billion last year from its treasury holdings, yet shared none of that with the people actually holding USDT – and Circle operates the same way. The value proposition has always been utility, not yield.

Now with a sovereign-backed currency starting to offer return, even modest ones, the holding calculus is changing. It is not built on speculation or DeFi trading – those use cases care about different things. But for treasury management, working capital, and cross-border settlement, the contexts where safety and yield both matter, interest-bearing digital yuan is starting to look competitive.

According to Fan Wenzhong, the Head of International Department at the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) in Beijing: ""This 'public-private hybrid' framework offers a balanced path: it allows nations to benefit from the reach of global stablecoins while introducing a sovereign-backed 'stabilizer' – effectively insulating them from the systemic risks of a purely private stablecoin market”.

All in all, stablecoins will not disappear. But they will face pressure in segments where their zero-yield reality becomes a disadvantage against a central bank alternative that is equally safe and now returns something extra.

With these news, it would be easy to frame this as China cracking a code that has stumped every other central bank. But the truth is messier – and much more interesting.

Interest-bearing digital yuan addresses a real gap that was unsolved for many years, if not decades. It creates holding incentives that M0 positioning never could, it gives commercial banks reason to participate actively rather than comply reluctantly, and it opens pathways for cross-border applications that current infrastructure handles poorly.

But success depends on factors that have not been tested under real conditions. Will businesses actually integrate digital yuan into treasury operations, or will it remain a policy priority that never quite translates into daily practice? Will the offshore architecture through Hong Kong achieve the flexibility international adoption requires without sacrificing the control Beijing wants to maintain? Will trading partners trust Chinese financial infrastructure enough to route their own settlements through it?

The original designers of the digital yuan asked a reasonable question: how do you bring cash into the digital age? The M1 shift suggests they have realized that was never the question that mattered most. The harder question – the one every central bank is now watching China try to answer – is how you build a currency that people choose when they have alternatives. Mandates can force usage, but it is only genuine utility that creates preference.

We are about to find out which approach works at scale – and the answers will shape how money moves for the next decades.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

The European Central Bank's work on a digital euro has increasingly been framed as a matter of monetary sovereignty. In recent submissions to the European Parliament, a number of economists have argued that without a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), Europe risks ceding control over its monetary system to foreign payment providers, BigTech platforms, and private digital monies.
1

 These concerns deserve to be taken seriously. Yet, much of the current debate risks obscuring more than it clarifies.

This column makes two related claims. First, monetary history suggests that CBDC is not a necessary condition for preserving a public monetary anchor. Second, many sovereignty arguments rest on a category mistake: the conflation of money with payments.

The first claim follows directly from the historical record. Money has never been a purely public institution. Across centuries, it has taken the form of a hybrid arrangement, combining a publicly defined unit of account with privately issued instruments. Medieval Europe relied heavily on bills of exchange issued by merchant banks; early modern trade was settled through clearing mechanisms rather than sovereign coin; and 19th century free banking systems were dominated by privately issued banknotes anchored by convertibility into specie (Spufford 2009, Sargent and Velde 2002, Gorton 1988). Stability did not hinge on universal access to public money, but on credible public backing and enforcement of par value.

The modern monetary system continues this tradition. Bank deposits – private liabilities – are the dominant form of money, supported by deposit insurance, regulation, and lender-of-last-resort facilities. Even cash, often portrayed as the paradigmatic public monetary instrument, has played a limited economic role and has rarely functioned as the primary store of value (Goodhart 1988). Its apparent status as a civic institution reflects 20th century technology and habit more than any deep constitutional principle.

Recent financial crises reinforce this interpretation. In the global financial crisis, the euro area sovereign crisis, the COVID-19 shock, and the 2023 banking turmoil, stability was preserved not by flights into cash but by large-scale expansions of central bank balance sheets via issuance of reserves. Risk absorption occurred overwhelmingly at the wholesale level, with central banks intermediating liquidity and solvency support to private institutions. The decisive public function operated through balance-sheet backstopping rather than through retail access to public money.

Historically, access to central bank balance sheets has been broader than access to reserves. In the US, primary dealers gained access to facilities functionally equivalent to the discount window during crises – such as the Primary Dealer Credit Facility in 2008 and 2020 – despite not holding reserve accounts. Money market funds and other non-bank institutions were stabilised through dedicated facilities without ever receiving reserves directly.

A similar logic applies in the euro area. Access to the Eurosystem's balance sheet has long extended beyond institutions with regular access to reserves or standing facilities. During the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis, the ECB absorbed risk primarily through banks, but also through a widening set of collateral frameworks, targeted longer-term refinancing operations, and emergency liquidity assistance (ELA), which allowed national central banks to provide liquidity to institutions that would not normally qualify as monetary policy counterparties. More recently, market-wide interventions – such as the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) – stabilised a broad range of non-bank balance sheets without granting direct reserve access. As in the US, these arrangements illustrate that monetary sovereignty is exercised through discretionary balance-sheet expansion and crisis instruments, not through universal or permanent access to central bank money.

From this perspective, what matters for monetary stability and sovereignty is not retail access to central bank liabilities, but the capacity of the central bank to absorb risk and enforce par convertibility across private monies (Adrian and Mancini-Griffoli 2019, Reichlin 2025a, 2025b, 2025c).

Key issues for financial stability and monetary sovereignty arise in relation to privately issued forms of broad money, such as stablecoins. Stablecoins function as means of payment and stores of value for on-chain activity. It is at this level – where bank deposits currently dominate – that monetary competition will take place.

A lightly used, capped, and non-remunerated CBDC is unlikely to be the instrument that disciplines or displaces large-scale stablecoin adoption, particularly when stablecoins are embedded in global platforms and denominated in foreign currencies. To the extent that stablecoins pose a challenge to monetary sovereignty, this challenge arises in the domain of broad money and payment networks. It is therefore more credibly addressed through regulation of stablecoins – in relation to their reserve backing - than through the introduction of a retail CBDC (Reichlin 2025b, 2025d).

The second claim concerns the structure of the sovereignty argument itself, and the way it frames the policy problem. Many calls for a digital euro implicitly equate monetary sovereignty with control over payment instruments and infrastructures. This is a conceptual error. Money and payments are related but distinct components within the monetary system. ‘Money' refers to the settlement asset, and the unit of account – what has been transferred, and in what quantity, when payment has been made.  ‘Payments' refers to the means by which the transaction takes place – which might be an inter-bank transfer using existing banking infrastructure, or it might be a series of entries on a blockchain.

This distinction is not semantic. Europe can lose control over payment rails without losing monetary sovereignty, just as it can retain monetary sovereignty while relying extensively on private or foreign payment providers. The euro's unit of account is defined and enforced by law; its value is stabilised by the ECB's balance sheet; and par convertibility across bank deposits is guaranteed by regulation and public backstops. None of these pillars requires the ECB to issue a retail CBDC.

Many of the concrete concerns raised in the sovereignty debate – dependence on foreign card networks, dominance of BigTech wallets, data extraction through payment platforms – are therefore primarily payment system issues. They call for competition policy, regulation, interoperability mandates, and the development of European payment infrastructures. Addressing them through CBDC risks overloading a monetary instrument with objectives that properly belong to payments policy.

Seen in this light, the digital euro addresses a different, more institutional problem. In the euro area, monetary union without full fiscal integration creates a persistent legitimacy gap. As cash use declines, the visibility of public money diminishes, while crisis management increasingly relies on opaque balance-sheet operations. A digital euro can thus be understood as a symbolic and constitutional response to fiscal fragmentation, reaffirming the presence of public money in a digital economy.

This symbolic role should not be dismissed. Symbols matter in monetary unions. But it should not be overstated either. The deliberately constrained design of the digital euro – non-remuneration, holding limits, and intermediated distribution – signals that it is not intended to replace private money, enhance payment efficiency, or materially improve crisis management. Its contribution to sovereignty is therefore indirect and political rather than operational.

In conclusion, the case for CBDC as a prerequisite for monetary sovereignty is weaker than often claimed. History suggests that sovereignty ultimately rests on legal authority and public balance sheets, not on universal access to public money. Confusing money with payments risks misdiagnosing the problem and misallocating policy effort. For Europe, the digital euro may play a useful symbolic role, but the effective defence of monetary sovereignty will continue to depend on regulation, fiscal capacity, and the central bank's willingness to absorb risk when it matters.

LG CNS said Thursday that it has demonstrated South Korea's first artificial intelligence-enabled digital currency payment system, developed in collaboration with the Bank of Korea.

The demonstration was conducted under the central bank's “Project Hangang,” a pilot initiative launched last year to test deposit tokens as a stepping stone toward a potential central bank digital currency. The project is designed to explore next-generation payment infrastructure in which AI agents can autonomously execute transactions on a digital currency platform.

For the pilot, LG CNS and the Bank of Korea simulated a real-world commerce scenario involving a digital content creator.

According to LG CNS, content creators often face inefficiencies due to repeated logins, searches and payment procedures across multiple platforms when purchasing assets such as images or background music. The newly tested system applies so-called “agentic AI” to streamline these processes by allowing AI agents to act on behalf of users.

In the demonstration, AI agents representing buyers and sellers communicated autonomously. The buyer agent searched for required content, compared prices and completed purchases, while payments were executed through the transfer of deposit tokens between digital wallets within parameters pre-approved by the user.

“Agentic commerce, where AI acts on behalf of consumers from product search to payment, is gaining global attention,” an LG CNS official said. “This demonstration shows that AI-driven payments using blockchain-based digital currency can be implemented within an automated payment framework.”

The Bank of Korea said it would continue its research to assess whether the infrastructure could support a wider range of digital payment instruments, including stablecoins.

On October 20, 2025, a DNS configuration error at Amazon Web Services cascaded into a 15-hour outage affecting 113 cloud services and over a thousand companies. For most businesses, this meant inconvenience. For institutions running critical financial operations on affected systems, it meant something more serious.

The Base blockchain—a Layer 2 network processing billions in transactions—saw block finalization times spike from 14 minutes to 78 minutes. Throughput dropped 40%. Users couldn't complete transactions.

During the same window, distributed blockchain networks continued operating without interruption. No degradation. No delays. The difference wasn't luck. It was architecture.

For institutions evaluating blockchain technology for regulated assets, this incident crystallized a question that deserves more attention than it typically receives: What are the legal and risk management implications of your technology choice?

Today, many institutions are choosing blockchain technology based on relationships.

Trust is obviously a critical component of any decision-making process, so it makes sense to start with known-entities and trusted individuals when exploring new solutions. The architecture of decentralized systems shifts that trust analysis from assessing an individual company or service provider to the technology itself.

But regulators will ask harder questions. Not ""who do you have a relationship with?"" but ""how did you assess the technology risk?"" Not ""is this blockchain popular?"" but ""what are the points of failure, and have you stress-tested them?""

Financial regulators have spent decades pushing institutions to reduce concentration risk in critical systems. They will expect the same discipline applied to blockchain technology choices.

The five questions institutions should be prepared to answer:

These questions—drawn from standard risk management frameworks—all point toward the same architectural conclusion.

The October AWS outage exposed a specific vulnerability: Base operates with a single sequencer—the entity that orders transactions and proposes blocks. That sequencer is operated by Coinbase. Its systems run on AWS. When AWS failed, Base degraded. The same happened with other Layer 2 networks, like Optimism and Arbitrum.

This is concentration risk in its purest form. A single operator. A single cloud provider. A single point of failure.

Layer 2 networks are often described as ""open"" because they settle to public blockchains like Ethereum. But the transaction processing layer—where users actually interact—frequently recentralizes around a single sequencer. What starts as open technology ends with a configuration that reintroduces the concentration risks blockchain was supposed to eliminate.

Metrika's post-mortem was direct: the incident ""underlines the significant single point of failure risk inherent to L2 blockchains that rely on a centralized entity model.""

Private blockchains present a different form of concentration risk. When a network is controlled by a consortium or a dominant company, institutions building on that network are subject to the unilateral decisions of someone else. That company might become a competitor. That consortium might change its rules. And critically: regulators can only verify what the controllers allow them to see.

For regulated institutions, concentration risk isn't just an operational concern. It's a governance question. Boards and risk committees will increasingly need to understand—and document—how technology choices align with their risk management frameworks.

The instinct to prefer ""private"" or ""permissioned"" over open networks is understandable. It maps to familiar corporate IT thinking: control access, limit exposure, own your environment.

But this framing confuses two different ideas: control over the network versus control over the assets.

Open doesn't mean uncontrolled. Open means no single controller.

On open networks with distributed validators, no individual party can unilaterally change network rules. The network is neutral because no one owns it.

But—and this is the point many observers miss—asset issuers are able to retain full control over their assets. They can determine who holds them, freeze them when required, execute clawbacks for fraud or regulatory enforcement. The openness is at the network layer; the controls exist at the asset layer.

This distinction matters legally. Open networks provide the resilience and neutrality benefits of decentralization. Asset-level controls provide the compliance capabilities regulators require. These aren't in tension—they're complementary.

The institutions that have moved furthest on tokenization—BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, U.S. Bank—have concluded that this combination represents the superior architecture for regulated assets.

On open networks, every transaction is permanently recorded and independently verifiable. Regulators don't need to request access from a private network operator—they can observe directly. Auditors can verify without relying on what a private network's controllers choose to disclose.

This inverts the common compliance concern. Open networks don't evade regulatory oversight—they enable more comprehensive oversight than closed systems. The question isn't whether regulators can see what's happening. It's whether they're limited to seeing only what a private operator allows.

For institutions subject to examination, this distinction has practical implications. Independent verifiability is a feature, not a bug.

Private blockchains create gatekeeping by design—that's their purpose. But gatekeeping in financial technology raises questions that legal and compliance teams should consider carefully.

Who decides which institutions can access the network? On what terms? What happens when the consortium's interests diverge from the interests of the institutions building on their chain? What if the network operator becomes a competitor?

Open networks sidestep these concerns structurally. When no one party controls access, no party can leverage that control.

For institutions building critical financial operations, dependency on a competitor's technology—or a consortium where competitors have influence—creates exposures that merit board-level and regulatory attention.

October 20, 2025, demonstrated the operational case objectively. Distributed validator networks—where multiple independent organizations run nodes across different providers and geographies—continued operating when centralized systems failed.

Networks with distributed validators maintained normal operations during the AWS outage. Networks dependent on single sequencers or concentrated cloud providers degraded or failed.

For financial operations that must run continuously, architectural resilience isn't optional. The standard isn't ""usually available."" It's the 99.99% uptime that serious financial operations require—achieved through distributed architecture, not through hoping your cloud provider doesn't have a bad day.

The regulatory landscape is moving toward technology neutrality. In the United States, recent executive action explicitly protects access to open public blockchains and mandates technology-neutral rulemaking.

The Basel Committee's guidance on crypto exposures—which imposed higher capital requirements for assets on permissionless blockchains—is increasingly contested. Industry bodies have argued the framework fails to distinguish between networks where anonymous validators can buy their way in and networks where validators are known, trusted entities operating without financial incentives to manipulate transactions.

And yes, this reality can exist on open blockchains that are not based on proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.

The direction of travel is clear: regulators are converging on frameworks that assess your technology choices based on outcomes – how that technology mitigates risks, rather than how similar it is to familiar legacy systems. Institutions building on open networks today are aligned with that trajectory.

Regulated assets worth billions of dollars settle on open networks daily. The SEC has approved funds operating on public blockchains. Major banks are piloting stablecoin issuance on open networks. The mechanisms work.

The real question for legal and risk teams is different:

With today's technology choices, can you continue to justify building critical financial operations on technology controlled by a single operator? Or dependent on a single cloud provider? Or subject to a competitor's decisions?

When the next outage occurs—and it will—what will you tell your board and regulators?



The shift to open blockchain technology is underway. The largest asset managers have moved. Regulatory frameworks are adapting. The October outage underscored the operational stakes.

What remains is helping institutions understand how open networks work in practice—how distributed validation provides resilience, how asset-level controls enable compliance, and how the architecture answers the questions regulators will ask.

Failing to explore open networks to improve operational resilience and compliance is not merely complacency; it's an omission that amounts to strategic risk. Because the case for open networks isn't just technical. It's legal, operational, and strategic.

It's a powerful case that is overlooked at one's peril.

X is preparing to launch “Starterpacks,” an onboarding feature for new users to help discover the best accounts and feeds based on interests like crypto and technology.

Unveiled Thursday, X will roll out the feature in the coming weeks, Nikita Bier, Head of Product at X, noted.

The curated starterpack in the crypto category will comprise memecoin trading with real-time market trends and sentiment from active traders.

A short video posted by Bier showed the preview of how starterpacks work. It shows users selecting their interests while onboarding and following the curated list of accounts.

The announcement arrives days after Bier's comments about crypto Twitter sparked backlash among the community. Crypto users have complained about the declining visibility of crypto content on X.

“Crypto Twitter (CT) is dying from suicide, not from the algorithm,” he wrote in response.

His response triggered growing frustration within the crypto community, with users believing that the platform is intentionally limiting crypto-related posts. Bier insisted that the issue is not tied to X's algorithms.

On Wednesday, Bitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp wrote that there were 96 million posts on X containing ‘Bitcoin' in 2025, a 32% drop year-over-year.

Although the data did not reflect overall crypto engagement, the post triggered concerns about discovery challenges and algorithmic shifts.

In a separate post on Wednesday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stressed the need for better mass communication tools.

“We need mass communication tools that serve the user's long-term interest, not maximize short-term engagement,” he wrote on X.

Further, he noted that crypto social projects has often been gone the wrong way.

“Decentralized social should be run by people who deeply believe in the “social” part, and are motivated first and foremost by solving the problems of social,” he added.

Scientists just calculated how many microplastics are in our atmosphere. The number is absolutely shocking

A new estimate suggests land sources eject 600 quadrillion pieces of microplastic into the atmosphere every year

By K. R. Callaway edited by Claire Cameron

Microplastics travel by air and sea, turning up even in remote areas.

Microplastics are pervasive, found everywhere on Earth, from the Sahara Desert to patches of Arctic sea ice. Yet despite these plastic particles' ubiquity, scientists have struggled to determine exactly how many of them are in our atmosphere.

Now a new estimate published in Nature suggests that land sources release about 600 quadrillion (600,000,000,000,000,000) microplastic particles into the atmosphere every year, about 20 times more than the number of particles contributed by oceans (about 26 quadrillion).

The median concentration of microplastics is 0.08 particle per cubic meter (m3) over land and 0.003 particle per m3 over sea, the study found.

These estimates are between 100 and 10,000 times lower than previous accountings of atmospheric microplastics—a discrepancy that the researchers behind the new study say underscores the need for better global measures of these pollutants.

“We knew that uncertainties of existing emission estimates were very large,” says Andreas Stohl, senior author of the study and an atmospheric scientist at the University of Vienna. “They are even still large after our study, but we could at least narrow down the uncertainty range, especially when it comes to the importance of land-based versus ocean-based emissions.”

A microplastic is any plastic particle sized between one micron and five millimeters. Easily swept up by wind and carried long distances by water, these tiny motes are also exceedingly difficult to detect and almost impossible to remove from the environment.

Past estimates have focused on accounting for microplastics generated by human activity or directly measuring their concentration in the air in any given area. But these measures are highly variable: along the southeastern coast of China, for example, atmospheric microplastic estimates have ranged from 0.004 to 190 particles per m3. To try and get at a more global estimate, Stohl and his team compiled 2,782 measurements collected at 283 locations worldwide.

The researchers hope the findings will act as a baseline for future studies of global microplastic levels, including new measures that will be able to account for even smaller particles than they did.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A common vitamin could influence bathroom frequency","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260122074659.htm","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 12:59:36 GMT","

Bowel habits may not be a popular topic, but they offer valuable insight into how efficiently the gut moves material through the digestive system. When this process becomes disrupted, people can develop constipation, diarrhea, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Even though these conditions are widespread, the biological processes that regulate bowel movements are still not fully mapped. A new study published on January 20 in Gut provides fresh genetic evidence about intestinal motility and points to vitamin B1 (thiamine) as an unexpected biological pathway worth further investigation.

The study was carried out by an international research team led by Mauro D'Amato, Professor of Medical Genetics at LUM University and Ikerbasque Research Professor at CIC bioGUNE, member of BRTA. The researchers used a large-scale genetic strategy to look for common DNA differences linked to how often people have bowel movements, referred to in the study as stool frequency. To do this, they analyzed genetic data and health questionnaires from 268,606 individuals of European and East Asian ancestry. Advanced computational methods helped identify which genes and biological processes were most strongly connected to gut movement.

Known Gut Pathways Confirm the Findings

The analysis uncovered 21 regions of the human genome that influence bowel movement frequency, including 10 regions that had not been identified before. Many of the genetic signals pointed to biological systems already known to regulate gut motion, offering reassurance that the results fit with established biology. These included bile-acid regulation (bile acids help digest fats and also act as signaling molecules in the gut) and nerve signaling involved in intestinal muscle contractions (including acetylcholine-related signaling, which helps nerves communicate with muscle). Together, these findings reinforce existing knowledge about how the gut functions.

Vitamin B1 Stands Out as a Surprise Signal

The most notable discovery emerged when researchers focused on two high-priority genes connected to vitamin B1 biology. These genes, SLC35F3 and XPR1, play a role in how thiamine is transported and activated in the body. To see whether this genetic signal was reflected in everyday life, the team analyzed dietary data from the UK Biobank. Among 98,449 participants, higher intake of dietary thiamine was linked to more frequent bowel movements.

This relationship was not uniform across all individuals. The effect of thiamine intake on bowel movement frequency depended on genetic variation in the SLC35F3 and XPR1 genes (analysed together as a combined genetic score). These results suggest that inherited differences in how the body handles thiamine may shape how vitamin B1 intake influences bowel habits in the general population.

Links to IBS and Future Research

Dr. Cristian Diaz-Muñoz, the study's first author, said ""We used genetics to build a roadmap of biological pathways that set the gut's pace. What stood out was how strongly the data pointed to vitamin B1 metabolism, alongside established mechanisms like bile acids and nerve signaling.""

The findings also suggest a meaningful biological connection between bowel movement frequency and IBS, a condition that affects millions of people worldwide.

Looking after your brain is something that happens over many years, and new findings from the AdventHealth Research Institute point to an encouraging option. Researchers report that sticking with a consistent aerobic exercise routine may help the brain remain biologically younger. This effect could support clearer thinking, better memory, and overall mental well-being.

The research showed that adults who committed to a full year of aerobic exercise had brains that appeared almost one year younger than those of participants who did not change how active they were.

Measuring Brain Age With MRI

Published in the Journal of Sport and Health Science, the study examined whether regular aerobic exercise could slow or even reverse what scientists call ""brain age."" Brain age is estimated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and reflects how old the brain appears compared to a person's actual age. A higher brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) means the brain looks older, and earlier studies have linked this measure to weaker physical and cognitive performance and a higher risk of death.

""We found that a simple, guideline-based exercise program can make the brain look measurably younger over just 12 months,"" said Dr. Lu Wan, lead author and data scientist at the AdventHealth Research Institute. ""Many people worry about how to protect their brain health as they age. Studies like this offer hopeful guidance grounded in everyday habits. These absolute changes were modest, but even a one-year shift in brain age could matter over the course of decades.""

Inside the Year-Long Exercise Trial

The clinical trial included 130 healthy adults between the ages of 26 and 58. Participants were randomly assigned to either a moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise group or a usual-care control group. Those in the exercise group completed two supervised 60-minute workout sessions each week in a laboratory and added home-based exercise to reach roughly 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week. This schedule matched the physical activity guidelines set by the American College of Sports Medicine.

Researchers measured brain structure using MRI scans and assessed cardiorespiratory fitness through peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) at the start of the study and again after 12 months.

Exercise Linked to a Younger Looking Brain

After one year, clear differences emerged between the two groups. Participants who exercised showed a measurable decrease in brain age, while those in the control group showed a slight increase. On average, the exercise group saw their brain-PAD drop by about 0.6 years, meaning their brains looked younger at the end of the study. The control group's brains appeared about 0.35 years older, a change that was not statistically significant. When compared directly, the gap between the two groups was close to one full year in favor of the exercise group.

""Even though the difference is less than a year, prior studies suggest that each additional 'year' of brain age is associated with meaningful differences in later-life health,"" said Dr. Kirk I. Erickson, senior author of the study and a neuroscientist and director at AdventHealth Research Institute and the University of Pittsburgh. ""From a lifespan perspective, nudging the brain in a younger direction in midlife could be very important.""

Why Exercise May Affect Brain Aging

To better understand why exercise influenced brain age, the research team looked at several possible factors. These included changes in physical fitness, body composition, blood pressure, and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports brain plasticity. Although fitness levels clearly improved with exercise, none of these factors statistically explained the reduction in brain-PAD seen in the trial.

""That was a surprise,"" Wan noted. ""We expected improvements in fitness or blood pressure to account for the effect, but they didn't. Exercise may be acting through additional mechanisms we haven't captured yet, such as subtle changes in brain structure, inflammation, vascular health or other molecular factors.""

Focusing on Midlife for Long-Term Benefits

Many studies on exercise and brain health focus on older adults, after age-related changes have already become more pronounced. This trial took a different approach by targeting people in early to mid-adulthood, when brain changes are harder to detect but prevention may offer greater benefits over time.

""Intervening in the 30s, 40s and 50s gives us a head start,"" Erickson said. ""If we can slow brain aging before major problems appear, we may be able to delay or reduce the risk of later-life cognitive decline and dementia.""

What the Findings Mean Going Forward

The authors caution that the study involved healthy, relatively well-educated volunteers and that the changes in brain age were modest. They note that larger studies and longer follow-up periods are needed to learn whether these reductions in brain-PAD lead to lower risks of stroke, dementia, or other brain-related diseases.

""People often ask, 'Is there anything I can do now to protect my brain later?'"" Erickson said. ""Our findings support the idea that following current exercise guidelines -- 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity -- may help keep the brain biologically younger, even in midlife.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","How type 2 diabetes quietly damages blood vessels","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260122093439.htm","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:07:05 GMT","

The risk of cardiovascular disease rises steadily the longer a person lives with type 2 diabetes. A new study from Karolinska Institutet, published in the journal Diabetes, suggests that changes in red blood cells may help explain this growing danger. The researchers also point to a specific molecule that could serve as a future biomarker for identifying cardiovascular risk.

People with type 2 diabetes face a higher likelihood of heart attacks and strokes, and that risk increases with each passing year of the disease. Earlier research has shown that red blood cells can influence how well blood vessels function in diabetes. The new study adds an important insight by showing that the length of time someone has diabetes strongly affects when these blood cell changes begin and how they develop. After many years, red blood cells may start to directly damage blood vessels.

Evidence From Patients and Animal Studies

To better understand these effects, the research team examined both animal models and people with type 2 diabetes. Red blood cells taken from mice and from patients who had lived with diabetes for a long time disrupted normal blood vessel function. In contrast, red blood cells from newly diagnosed patients showed no harmful impact. However, after seven years of follow up, those same patients developed red blood cells with similar damaging properties. When scientists restored levels of microRNA-210 in the red blood cells, blood vessel function improved.

""What really stands out in our study is that it is not only the presence of type 2 diabetes that matters, but how long you have had the disease. It is only after several years that red blood cells develop a harmful effect on blood vessels,"" says Zhichao Zhou, associate professor at the Department of Medicine, Solna, Karolinska Institutet, and lead author of the study.

A Possible Early Warning Marker

The findings suggest that microRNA-210 in red blood cells could be used as a biomarker to help detect the risk of cardiovascular complications at an earlier stage. Researchers are now exploring whether this approach can be applied in larger population studies.

""If we can identify which patients are at greatest risk before vascular damage has already occurred, we can also become better at preventing complications,"" says Eftychia Kontidou, doctoral student from the same group and the first author of the study.

CD8+ T cells can rapidly produce effector molecules following activation. This activation triggers rapid changes in gene expression that rely on the control of mRNA levels via multiple mechanisms, including RNA modifications. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant post-transcriptional modification that promotes the decay of messenger RNAs in the cytosol. However, how recognition of m6A sites is integrated with other regulatory mechanisms that alter the fate of immunoregulatory mRNAs in CD8+ T cells remains unexplored. Here, we apply the m6A-iCLIP and GLORI methods to identify the importance of m6A sites flanked by AU-rich elements (AREs) within the 3'UTRs of CD8+ T cell mRNAs. Presence of such ARE-flanking m6A motifs predicts meta-unstable mRNAs that rapidly decay upon CD8+ T cell activation. We demonstrate interdependent effects of mutations in the identified AREs and RRACHs on TNF mRNA stability. The ARE-flanking m6A sites in these mRNAs show particularly high iCLIP crosslinking of YTHDF proteins, which are also identified by proteomic interactome analyses along with additional novel RNA-binding proteins. Our study reveals a crosstalk between m6A and ARE-dependent mechanisms in CD8+ T cells, providing new approaches for modulating mRNA decay in T cell activation.

CD8+ T cells, also known as cytotoxic or killer T cells, play a crucial role in the immune response against malignant and virally infected cells1. When CD8+ T cells encounter infected or malignant cells, they proliferate and differentiate into effector cells (Teff), which produce high levels of effector molecules to kill target cells. After target cell clearance, most Teff cells undergo apoptosis, but importantly, a subset differentiates into memory cells (TM), which persist and provide long-term immunity2. When activated, CD8+ T cells undergo rapid changes in gene expression that rely on finely-tuned control of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels3. An important determinant of mRNA stability in CD8+ T cells are the adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (AU-rich elements; AREs)4, abundant sequences in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of many mRNAs; these are particularly prominent in cytokine mRNAs5,6. AREs recruit RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that promote either RNA stabilisation (e.g., HuR) or degradation (e.g., ZFP36L1/L2), thus representing an important mechanism of regulation of effector molecule production by TM cells after T-cell activation3,7.

Another determinant of cellular mRNA stability is N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation. The m6A modification is co-transcriptionally deposited on mRNAs by the core methyltransferase complex METTL3/METTL14/WTAP8, which plays widespread regulatory roles in mRNA metabolism; these include nuclear export, splicing, stability, translation, and compartmentalisation8,9,10,11,12. m6A demethylation is catalysed by α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent dioxygenases, which include FTO and ALKBH5 demethylases13,14. Deposition of m6A is largely associated with accelerated mRNA metabolism through the activity of m6A reader proteins, including YTHDF proteins (YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3), that promote mRNA decay in the cytoplasm and P-bodies15,16. Recognition of m6A-modified RNAs is crucial in cell differentiation and development17,18, and dysregulation of m6A deposition has been reported in leukaemia, aging and neurodegeneration19,20,21.

Various next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods enable the transcriptomic profiling of individual m6A modifications by applying chemical, enzymatic, or antibody-based recognition of modified ribonucleosides and/or direct RNA sequencing to detect m6A residues on mRNAs22,23,24. One of these methods for profiling m6A at single-nucleotide resolution is miCLIP (also known as m6A-CLIP)25,26. This method relies on the use of anti-m6A antibodies for the immunoprecipitation of m6A-modified RNA fragments, which form covalent crosslinks with the antibody upon exposure to UV-C light. Insights from miCLIP and other methods demonstrate that m6A is primarily present in consensus RRACH (R, purine; H, not G) sequences, with greatest enrichment near stop codons at the start of 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of mRNAs25,26,27,28. Several methods have also reported signals in non-RRACH motifs, with variation between cell types and methodologies used. For instance, non-RRACH pentamers such as GGAUU were reported by the miCLIP2 study in HEK293T and C643 lines29. Direct RNA sequencing revealed 187 m6A sites in AGAUU in Arabidopsis mRNAs30. However, the roles of such non-RRACH sites in the m6A-dependent regulation of mRNA metabolism have not been systematically investigated.

Evidence shows that m6A modification is an important factor in immune-modulatory responses, including antitumor immunity31. Deletion of the reader protein YTHDF1 in mouse dendritic cells enhances antitumor responses through increased tumour antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells32. Deletion of METTL3 blocks mouse CD4+ T cell differentiation by keeping the cells in a naïve state33. However, we do not yet fully understand how the recognition of m6A sites is integrated with other regulatory mechanisms to control mRNA stability during T cell activation. It is clear that diverse RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), in addition to canonical YTH domain m6A readers, can regulate mRNA stability in m6A-dependent ways9,16. For instance, m6A mRNA methylation can either promote or inhibit the binding of HuR to transcripts such as SOX234 and FOXM135, or to various regions in a single mRNA18. It is thus important to characterise how m6A deposition might interact with various regulatory motifs to control the fate of immunoregulatory mRNAs in T cells.

Here, we used an improved iCLIP protocol (iiCLIP)36 in the context of miCLIP to profile m6A in human CD8+ T cells before and after activation. As expected, the strongest enrichment of the miCLIP signal was found in RRACH motifs (miCLIP-RRACH), but we have also identified enrichment within ARE motifs (miCLIP-ARE). Absolute quantification of m6A sites using the antibody-independent GLORI method37 revealed that miCLIP-ARE sites contain RRACH motifs within ± 4 nucleotides of AREs, which may represent a distinct functional subclass of m6A sites.

Through measurements of mRNA stability, we showed that mRNAs in which we identified ARE-flanking m6A sites are meta-unstable, so that they become rapidly degraded in activated CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, these mRNAs encode late-effector and memory proteins. Through supervised learning of mRNA half-life data, we found that the combined miCLIP and GLORI signal in ARE-flanking m6A sites is more effective at predicting meta-instability than either signal in canonical RRACH motifs alone. We investigated these relationships further by manipulating the m6A machinery and with reporter assays. We found that METTL3 inhibition increases the stability of target mRNAs harbouring ARE-flanking m6A sites, such as IL7R and TNF. We also demonstrated that the impact of mutations in miCLIP-ARE sites on the stability of the 3'UTR-TNF mRNA depends on mutations in RRACH sites. Finally, we showed that miCLIP-ARE sites were enriched in iCLIP crosslink sites of YTHDF proteins and newly identified ARE-bound RBPs uncovered in this study, particularly members of the LSM family. These findings indicate that canonical m6A-modified RRACH motifs and the ARE-flanking m6A sequences represent functionally distinct m6A sites, bound by different m6A-reader RBPs. Together, they likely coordinate the meta-decay of mRNAs involved in key regulatory functions of CD8+ T cells.

We applied a methylation-improved iCLIP (miCLIP)25,26,36 assay to study m6A methylation in non-activated and activated CD8+ T cells, where an anti-m6A antibody was used to immunoprecipitate fragmented RNA isolated from primary human CD8+ T cells subjected to in vitro activation with aCD3/aCD28 beads (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Our miCLIP workflow introduces several features to identify motifs at anti-m6A crosslinks with high specificity: (a) m6A immunoprecipitation with or without UV irradiation of the m6A antibody to RNA to account for the technical impact of UV crosslinking38; (b) sequencing of fragmented input RNAs with the same protocol, to account for the technical biases of cDNA ligation and other aspects of the protocol39 and allow us to normalise data by RNA abundance40,41; (c) use of UMIs and the iCLIP analysis approach to identify unique cDNA molecules; and (d) use of positionally enriched k-mer analysis (PEKA)42 to identify the motifs enriched around high-confidence (thresholded) crosslinks, i.e., crosslinks located within peaks of high crosslink density, relative to crosslinks located outside peak regions; peaks were determined using either Clippy or Paraclu43 (Methods) (Fig. 1A). Hierarchical clustering of 5-mers based on PEKA scores of thresholded sites revealed enrichment of crosslinks in GGACU and other variants of the RRACH consensus as well as motifs corresponding to the WWAWW consensus (W = A or U), reminiscent of the AU-rich elements (AREs) (Fig. 1B). The two sets of motifs were enriched at the starts of miCLIP reads for non-activated (noAct), Day1- and Day5-activated CD8+ T cell samples but not at the starts of cDNAs prepared from input RNA (Fig. 1B). Noticeably, both the RRACH and WWAWW consensus sequences were enriched at the start of miCLIP reads in the absence of UV crosslinking (Fig. 1B), although some W-rich sequences were UV-dependent (Fig. 1B). This finding suggested that UV irradiation only partially promotes the crosslinking of nearby uridines to the anti-m6A antibody.

A The miCLIP workflow for identification of high-confidence crosslinks: (1) primary human CD8+ T cells subjected to in vitro activation with aCD3/aCD28 beads; (2) RNA enrichment and experimental controls, including m6A immunoprecipitation without UV irradiation (noUV) and input RNA samples; (3) SDS‒PAGE purification of RNA fragments crosslinked to the anti-m6A antibody followed by RNA isolation; (4) library preparation; (5) iCLIP analysis for determination of uniquely mapped crosslinks; (6) determination of peaks, i.e., regions with high density of crosslinks; (7) ‘positionally enriched k-mer analysis' (PEKA) to extract sequences in high-confidence (‘thresholded') miCLIP crosslinks. B Hierarchical clustering of 5-mers based on standardised PEKA scores at ‘thresholded sites'; here, crosslinks and Clippy peaks were used for PEKA. The median PEKA score of each miCLIP or Input group (noAct, Day1 or Day5) was calculated for all 5-mers, and the unique sets of the 20 most enriched and variant 5-mers were plotted on the heatmap. C Metagene distribution of GLORI-determined m6A counts at miCLIP sites (top) and number-matched control sites randomly selected from the 3'UTR (bottom), centred on RRACH, WWAWW and CRACH pentamers; GLORI counts show the effect of the METTL3 inhibitor at each position, and represent the average across two CD8+ T cell replicates. D Metagene distribution of GLORI-determined m6A counts centred on miCLIP-ARE sites that contain nearby RRACH motifs (left) or lack RRACH motifs (right), showing the effect of the METTL3 inhibitor. Stratification by distance highlights the spatial relationship between m6A deposition and RRACH proximity. The WWAWW + RRACH sites refer to miCLIP-ARE sites containing at least one RRACH motif within ≤ 50nt.

For all panels, CD8+ T cells from healthy donors were isolated; not activated (noAct; n = 4), Day1 after activation (Day1; n = 5), Day5 after activation (Day5; n = 4), Mock (n = 12), noUV (n = 3). Panel (A) was created in BioRender. Foskolou, I. (2026) https://BioRender.com/ h18sinc. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

The metagene distribution of motifs around the starts of miCLIP cDNAs demonstrated direct alignment with the A motif corresponding to GGACU (and RRACH consensus) and proximal to UUAUU (and WWAWW consensus), but not those corresponding to CRACH consensus (e.g., CGACU) (Supplementary Fig. S1B), which is in agreement with reports showing that METTL3 does not exhibit in vitro activity on CGACU-containing RNA probes44. The starts of iCLIP reads can be enriched at uridines due to nucleotide biases of UV crosslinking, but the starts of miCLIP reads were aligned within two nucleotides from A, both at the RRACH and WWAWW motif centres (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1B). On one hand, the UV independence of motif enrichment, and alignment of cDNA starts with As, indicates that the RNA-bound part of the antibody is carried over throughout the miCLIP procedure and can induce cDNA truncation at its RNA contact sites even when it is not UV crosslinked. This is surprising, since the procedure involves high-salt washing of the IP mixture, separation of the antibody-RNA complex via SDS‒PAGE, transfer to a membrane and treatment with proteinase K to release an antibody peptide bound to RNA. Accordingly, we detected an infrared signal on the membrane in all the miCLIP and noUV samples that were immunoprecipitated with the anti-m6A antibody but not in the UV-crosslinked samples immunoprecipitated with a control IgG isotype (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Notably, the m6A antibody was developed against a monomer of N6-methyladenosine conjugated to a keyhole limpet haemocyanin lacking any WWAWW motifs; therefore, we speculated that contacts with AREs might be mediated by the presence of m6A on these sites.

Typical iCLIP relies on the analysis of cDNA starts as signatures of cDNA truncations induced by the crosslinked peptide45,46. Moreover, less frequent readthrough of reverse transcriptase (RT) across cross-linked peptides can lead to deletions and insertions, which can be analysed for cross-linking-induced mutation sites (CIMS)25,47. Expectedly, the incidence of deletions was higher in miCLIP than in input samples (Supplementary Fig. S1D). In this regard, it is documented that m6A-modified RRACHs result in CIMS characterised by C > T substitutions25. To assess motif-specific CIMS, we expanded the CIMS analysis to include C > T, T > A and A > T transitions to account for transitions in the ARE sites. While C > T substitutions were enriched at the genomic coordinates of RRACHs, T > A substitutions were enriched within AREs, but not detected at CRACH centres (Supplementary Fig. S1E). These substitutions were enriched regardless of whether UV was used in miCLIP. This indicates that the bound antibody peptide might be able to maintain bound to the RNA fragments throughout the CLIP procedure and form direct contacts with RRACHs and AREs, so that it can affect the mutation and truncation rate of reverse transcription at these motifs.

To assess the signal in AREs in other datasets, we analysed the published miCLIP2 data, where 661 m6A sites were reported in non-DRACH sequences29. By assessing the distribution of PEKA crosslinks around relevant motifs, we found significant enrichment of miCLIP2 crosslinks centred at GGACU and UUAUU pentamers, but not CGACU, in miCLIP2 data from both mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and human cell lines (HEK293T and C643) (Supplementary Fig. S1F, S1G). In mESCs, the PEKA crosslinks were Mettl3 dependent at GGACU centres, but the signal at UUAUU centres was less affected by Mettl3 loss (Supplementary Fig. S1F). Antibody-independent methods also enable m6A profiling with single-base resolution, although some are experimentally tailored to specifically probe RRACH or related subset sequences, such as MAZTER-seq48 and m6A-REF-seq49 that rely on endoribonuclease recognition of ACA sequences. Among these methods, the recently developed GLORI features glyoxal- and nitrite-mediated deamination of unmodified adenosines, enabling the absolute quantification of m6A sites with high specificity37. By analysing GLORI-processed data in HEK293T cells, we observed that m6A peaks were enriched at RRACH and depleted directly at WWAWW pentamers enriched in their vicinity (Supplementary Fig. S1H). We further interrogated m6A sites previously identified using the antibody-free MePMe-seq method in HeLa cells50; these sites were also mildly enriched within 10 nucleotides from WWAWW pentamers but depleted directly at the ‘A' centre (Supplementary Fig. S1I). Conversely, both antibody-independent methods showed that m6A sites were depleted at the ‘A' centre yet not enriched in the vicinity of CRACH pentamers, with fivefold lower counts at each position when compared to WWAWW motifs (Supplementary Fig. S1H, S1I). Thus, our miCLIP data and that of Kortel et al.29 revealed WWAWW-centred (ARE-like) motifs, which we denoted miCLIP-ARE sites. Conversely, two antibody-free methods in immortalised cell lines showed that m6A sites are enriched in RRACH motifs and proximal to WWAWW motifs, yet depleted at the WWAWW-centred A (Supplementary Fig. S1H, S1I). This led us to hypothesise that miCLIP-ARE sites may represent canonical RRACH motifs flanked by AREs in their immediate vicinity. To test this in a METTL3-dependent manner, we performed GLORI in primary CD8+ T cells under activation conditions, with or without a competitive METTL3 inhibitor51. GLORI-detected m6A sites (GLORI-m6A counts) were highly enriched in miCLIP-RRACH sites (Fig. 1C). Notably, a substantial fraction (10%) of GLORI-m6A counts localised within ± 4 nucleotides of miCLIP-ARE sites, with signal peaking just 2 nucleotides downstream, while remaining low at the central A of WWAWW motifs (Fig. 1C). These signals were METTL3-dependent and most reduced in the non-activated T cells, suggesting functional roles (Fig. 1C – orange line). Importantly, the GLORI-m6A sites were more enriched around miCLIP-ARE sites (i.e., 8056 thresholded sites) than around randomly sampled 3'UTR ARE sites (i.e., 8056 control sites). Conversely, the GLORI signals at miCLIP-RRACH sites showed a similar enrichment pattern to those at randomly sampled RRACH sites, albeit with higher overall signal intensity (Fig. 1C). The data strongly suggest that miCLIP-ARE sites correspond to canonical RRACH motifs with flanking AREs within (±) 4 nucleotides of the ‘A' centre.

To further dissect this motif relationship, we stratified miCLIP-ARE sites based on the proximity of RRACH motifs within ± 5, 25 and 50 nucleotides. In agreement with the preceding meta-analyses, the GLORI-m6A counts were enriched at miCLIP-ARE sites with flanking RRACHs, but not at miCLIP-ARE sites lacking nearby RRACH motifs (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1J). Together, these findings uncover a class of m6A sites corresponding to RRACH motifs flanked by AREs – termed ARE-flanking m6A sites. Finally, consistent with previous reports, the overall miCLIP signal was most enriched around stop codons (Fig. 1E). Moreover, miCLIP-ARE sites displayed specific enrichment at the start of 3'UTRs, which contrasted the input signal in AREs, which was more evenly distributed across the entire 3'UTR (Fig. 1E). Importantly, the omission of UV crosslinking from miCLIP (noUV) had very little effect on motif distribution, consistent with antibody-RNA complex detection by SDS-PAGE. Thus, ARE-flanking m6A sites (miCLIP-AREs) may represent a distinct functional subclass when compared to canonical miCLIP-RRACH sites.

The m6A modification promotes mRNA decay in various cell types, but its effects on individual mRNAs vary significantly9. In this respect, which m6A sites play a role in fine-tuning transcript levels for dynamic and stimulus-dependent responses is not well understood. To assess mRNA-specific features in CD8+ T cells, we partitioned the miCLIP and input signal into RRACH and ARE motifs, normalised the counts using the DESeq2 model, and compared the hierarchical clustering of 3'UTRs across miCLIP and input samples. First, principal component analysis (PCA) of miCLIP counts across the top 1000 most variable 3'UTRs showed that miCLIP-RRACH and miCLIP-ARE motifs were clearly separated along the first two principal components (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Second, we observed that the miCLIP counts were poorly correlated with input counts in the respective motif (Supplementary Fig. S2B – light squares), indicating that changes in the miCLIP signal do not arise from changes in mRNA expression or stability3. Hierarchical clustering of mRNA 3'UTRs revealed 4 clusters characterised by different miCLIP signatures across different CD8+ T cell states: 3'UTRs with high miCLIP-ARE signal and low miCLIP-RRACH signal (cluster 1), lowly expressed 3'UTRs with high miCLIP-ARE and miCLIP-RRACH signal (cluster 2), 3'UTRs with low miCLIP-ARE and high miCLIP-RRACH signal (cluster 3), and highly expressed 3'UTRs with varied degrees of miCLIP signal in AREs or RRACHs (cluster 4) (Fig. 2A). Cluster 4, defined by highly expressed mRNAs mainly in activated CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2A), contained mRNAs typically upregulated during T cell activation; these included genes involved in macromolecule biosynthetic processes (e.g., RPL15, RPL23, RPL31, RPL38, EIF4G1, MRPL3), MHC II class (HLA-A), glycolysis (PGK1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA and LDHB), and granzyme B (GZMB) (Supplementary Fig. S2C and Supplementary Data 1). In contrast, cluster 2 included mRNAs involved in immunoregulation and mRNA metabolism. For example, cluster 2 contained mRNAs that play a crucial role in regulating cytokine production (ZFP36L1, ZFP36L2), immune activation (CD28, CD69, TNFAIP3, GBP1), and T cell memory (BCL2, CXCR4, IL7R, TCF7), TNF signalling genes (TNF, TNFRSF1B, TNFAIP8, TNFRSF9), other interleukins and cytokine-related genes (e.g., IL7R, IL10RA, IL27RA, CXCR6, CCR4, CCL3), RNA splicing (SRSF4), and relevant RNA processing (LSM1) and stress granule assembly factors (G3BP2) (Supplementary Fig. S2C and Supplementary Data 1)3. Conversely, cluster 3 included mRNAs that regulate ribosomal processing and biogenesis (DDX54, DEDD2, EIF6, RRP36), T cell activation and innate immunity response (e.g., CXCR3, GZMH, CD74, CD7, CD44) (Supplementary Fig. S2C and Supplementary Data 1).

To assess the effect of CD8+ T cell activation on mRNA stability and its links to dynamic m6A sites, we performed SLAM-seq (thiol(SH)-linked alkylation for metabolic sequencing of RNA)52 and determined mRNA half-lives in noAct, Day1 and Day5 activated CD8+ T cells. We performed a pulse-chase design of 24 h labelling with 4-thiouridine (4SU) pulsed every 4 h, followed by washout with uridine for 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6 and 16 h. By fitting the T > C transitions over time to an exponential decay model and applying a goodness of fit cutoff (R2 > 0.5), we determined reliable half-life estimates (t1/2 = ln(2) / k, k = decay constant) for 4158, 5585 and 5866 transcripts in noAct, Day1 and Day5 activated CD8+ T cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2D and Supplementary Data 1). The median mRNA half-life was reduced in activated CD8+ T cells, from 3.6 h in noAct to 3.2 h in Day1 and 2.2 h in Day5 activated T cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D). The mRNA half-lives determined via SLAM-Seq agree with previously published mRNA half-lives in other mammalian cells52,53,54 and with the expected high mRNA turnover in activated T cells55. Comparing mRNA half-lives between the miCLIP clusters revealed that mRNAs with miCLIP-ARE and miCLIP-RRACH sites (cluster 2) had shorter half-lives when compared to mRNAs with low miCLIP signal (i.e., nomiCLIP, ≤ 2 miCLIP counts averaged across samples) included in the DESeq2 model (Fig. 2B). Conversely, highly expressed mRNAs with low miCLIP-RRACH signal (cluster 4) had the longest half-lives (Fig. 2B). We next examined mRNA half-life distributions in relation to GLORI-determined m⁶A sites (GLORI sites), stratified by the proximity of ARE motifs (WWAWW) located within ± 3, 5, 15, 25 or 50 nucleotides of a RRACH motif. Consistent with our miCLIP data, RRACH-flanking ARE sites were associated with significantly shorter mRNA half-lives compared to RRACH sites lacking nearby AREs (i.e., no WWAWW motifs within ± 50 nt) (Fig. 2C). Notably, in Day 5 activated T cells, the mRNA half-lives progressively decreased as the distance between RRACH and ARE motifs narrowed (Fig. 2C, D). The significance threshold (P = 0.05) separated clearly the RRACH-flanking versus RRACH-lacking ARE sites within ±50 nucleotides (Fig. 2D). Relative to genes with low miCLIP (nomiCLIP) or low GLORI (noGLORI) signal, the miCLIP-cluster 2 and GLORI-cluster i were the most destabilised in Day5 activated T cells (Fig. 2C), even though all mRNAs were overall destabilised following CD8+ T cell activation (Supplementary Fig. S2E). Therefore, the datasets support the notion that activation of CD8+ T cells leads to faster decay of mRNAs that harbour ARE-flanking m6A sites (miCLIP-cluster 2 and GLORI-cluster i).

To test whether GLORI-determined m6A sites exhibit similar regulatory patterns, we stratified them into two classes: RRACH-only sites and ARE-flanking m6A sites (i.e., RRACH motifs with at least one ARE within ± 50 nucleotides). Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 showed a clear distinction between the two m6A subclasses in activated T cells (Fig. 2E), with RRACH-flanking ARE sites associated with significantly shorter half-lives compared to RRACH-only sites (Supplementary Fig. S2F). These short-lived transcripts (GLORI-cluster i) showed a 29% overlap with miCLIP-cluster 2, characterised by strong miCLIP-ARE and miCLIP-RRACH signals (Fig. 2A), and included immunoregulatory mRNAs such as CXCR4, CXCR6, G3BP2, IL7R, IL10RA, LSM1, TNFAIP3, TNFAIP8, and ZFP36L2 (Supplementary Data 1). Although the GLORI-cluster ii displayed similar half-life distributions when compared to the noGLORI group (Supplementary Fig. S2F), it still overlapped by 19% with miCLIP-cluster 2 and included several short-lived mRNAs such as TNF and TNFRSF1B (Supplementary Data 1). These findings suggest that ARE-flanking m6A sites and isolated m6A sites are functionally distinct in terms of mRNA stability during T cell activation. Moreover, the two m6A subclasses may contribute differently to post-transcriptional regulation relevant to T cell immune functions.

To test for associations between these m6A signatures and T cell subtype-specific roles, we interrogated mRNAs half-lives within transcriptional modules known to be co-activated in effector versus memory T cells56. Noticeably, the gene modules with shorter half-lives in the SLAM-seq data comprised late effector- and memory-related mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S2G - modules C, D and F), as defined by Best et al.56 and these were the most destabilised mRNAs during CD8+ T cell activation (Supplementary Fig. S2H). We next grouped mRNA half-lives based on their quartile distribution, < 2.3 (25%), 2.3−3.5 (50%), 3.5−5.3 (75%) and > 5.3 h (100%) in Day5 activated T cells and analysed how they connect to both m6A signatures (miCLIP and GLORI clusters) and CD8+ gene modules (Fig. 2G). Indeed, the late effector, memory precursor and naïve/late effector/memory genes (modules C, D and F) contained more shorter-lived (< 2.3 and 2.3–3.5 hr) than long-lived (3.5–5.3 and > 5.3 hr) mRNAs, which were enriched in miCLIP-cluster 2 and GLORI-cluster i (Fig. 2G – red and green lines). In contrast, the control groups (nomiCLIP and noGLORI) contained mainly cell cycle/division genes, which were overall longer lived (> 2.3 hr) (Fig. 2G – blue lines). These data suggest that ARE-flanking m6A sites in the 3'UTR is a feature of highly unstable – or meta-unstable – mRNAs with T cell memory roles in the activated state.

This led us to assess the most unstable (< 3.0 hr, 30 pth) and stable (> 5.3 hr, 30 pth) mRNAs in our SLAM-seq data based on the motif-specific m6A signatures. To this end, we trained conditional random forest (cRF) models to classify mRNAs as unstable (N = 230) or stable (N = 230) based on eight experimental features in our miCLIP dataset: (1–6) cluster identity, i.e., presence or absence of mRNA in each miCLIP cluster (c1 to c4) or GLORI cluster (ci and cii); (7) CD8+ state (noAct, Day1 and Day5) as a categorical variable; (8) CD8+ gene modules (A to G) as a categorical variable; and two 3'UTR features, (9) frequency of RRACH pentamers and (10) frequency of ARE (WWAWW) pentamers. First, we determined that two t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t.SNE) dimensions could partly resolve unstable and stable mRNAs based on the ten features considered (Fig. 2H), suggesting that a binary classifier may perform well in predicting the two mRNA classes. To determine the best predictive features of unstable and stable mRNAs, we used a conditional variable importance measure that computes the change in prediction accuracy (number of mRNAs classified correctly) when each predictor is permuted in a conditional manner (i.e., using a within-groups permutation that accounts for correlated variables)57. By determining the conditional variable importance on the 30 cRF models (3 repeats of 10-fold resampled iterations each) in the training set (75% of mRNAs), we showed that CD8+ gene modules, miCLIP-cluster 2 and ARE frequency in the 3'UTR were among the most important features in its unique contribution to the cRF models (Fig. 2I). Noticeably, the frequency of ARE motifs within 3'UTRs varied more substantially across clusters than did the frequency of RRACH motifs (Supplementary Fig. S2I). Particularly, GLORI-cluster i was enriched for AREs, whereas GLORI-cluster ii was comparatively depleted of AREs relative to noGLORI mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S2I).

To evaluate the performance of the cRF classifier, we assessed the predictions from the i) 10-fold cross-validation (CV) during training (training performance) and ii) final model on a held-out test set (25% of mRNAs) in terms of the following metrics: accuracy, specificity, precision, recall (or sensitivity), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and F1 measure. The test set performance of the cRF classifier was 75–83% for each metric, indicating good predictive performance for the positive class (unstable mRNAs) (Fig. 2J – green points). Thus, the cRF classifier showed strong performance in predicting truly unstable mRNAs (PPV), and the high specificity indicates accurate identification of both unstable and stable mRNAs.

In addition, the balanced F1 score on the test set (78%) highlights the model's overall effectiveness in balancing sensitivity and precision in the classification of unstable mRNAs (Fig. 2J), with CD8+ gene modules and interlinked AREs being important features in this prediction (Fig. 2I). Across the 10-CV folds, the training performance was 65–67% for each metric on averaged (Fig. 2J), which suggests that the 30 cRF models can be improved by being trained on more comprehensive data. Importantly, the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves confirmed that all 10-CV folds performed above a random classifier at all classification cutoff points (Fig. 2K, L), confirming the performance consistency across folds. Similarly, the ROC and PR curves from the final test predictions confirmed the generalisation capacity of the model (Fig. 2K, L). While the combined predictors did not fully account for mRNA instability in the test set (balanced accuracy = 79%) (Fig. 2J), these data indicate that ARE-flanking m6A sites (miCLIP-cluster 2) are better predictors of meta-unstable mRNAs than RRACH-only m6A sites (miCLIP-cluster 3 and GLORI-cluster ii). These findings support a model in which the presence of AREs within 3'UTR enhances m6A-dependent mRNA decay during T cell activation.

To confirm our transcriptomic findings on essential genes for CD8+ T cel biology, we assessed the stability of newly transcribed mRNAs harbouring ARE-flanking m6A sites and RRACH-only m6A sites (Fig. 2A - cluster 2). To this end, we treated CD8+ T cells with DMSO or METTL3 inhibitor and, on Day 5 after activation, we blocked de novo transcription with actinomycin D and measured mRNA decay over time. METTL3 inhibition increased mRNA stability for IL7R (T cell memory marker58), TNF (essential effector molecule) mRNAs and a trend increase in CD69 (T cell activation marker59) (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). METTL3 inhibition/deletion also showed an overall increase in total mRNA levels of several mRNAs linked to memory formation (e.g., IL7R) and chemokines and cytokines important for CD8+ T cell function (CCL4, TNF, IFNG) (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3B, S3C).

IL7Rα is an essential receptor for CD8+ T cells, whose surface expression serves as a marker for long-lived memory CD8+ T cells60. Particularly, the IL7R mRNA showed high-confidence miCLIP-RRACH and miCLIP-ARE sites (Supplementary Fig. S3D), also detected by GLORI as an ARE-flanking m6A within 50nt of a RRACH (GAACU) sequence (Fig. 2E – cluster i). In agreement with previous results (Figs. 1 and 2), we determined higher IL7R mRNA stability and total mRNA levels upon METTL3 inhibition (Fig. 3A, B), as well as an increased population of CD8+ T cells expressing this surface marker and with higher intensity (Fig. 3C–F). These data indicate that m6A levels in ARE-flanking RRACH sites contribute to destabilisation of meta-unstable mRNAs, such as IL7R (t1/2 = 2.3 hr), that characterise memory-precursor functions in activated CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2G – module D, Supplementary Data 1).

Other important genes for CD8+ T cell function include cytokines such as TNFα and IFNγ, essential for target clearance but also highly toxic, thus requiring a fined-tuned regulation of their expression. Memory CD8+ T cells accumulate pre-formed mRNAs of IFNG and TNF, which can be rapidly translated upon activation without the need of de novo transcription61. Both TNF and IFNG mRNAs exhibited miCLIP-AREs, and the TNF had a clear miCLIP-RRACH site (Supplementary Fig. S3E, F), with METTL3 inhibition causing an increase in their steady-state levels (Fig. 3B). We used GFP reporter assays to further investigate the effect of m6A on TNFα and IFNγ expression, where GFP was fused with either the 3'UTR of IFNG, TNF or GzmB mRNA, and the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) measured (Supplementary Fig. S3E–H). CD8+ T cells were transduced with the constructs, rested, and treated with increasing concentrations of the FTO inhibitor meclofenamic acid (MA) for 7 h, followed by overnight CD8+ T cell activation62. The GzmB mRNA was used as a negative control, as it harbours a short 3'UTR, a feature previously associated with enhanced stability in T cells63. This was confirmed by SLAM-seq, which showed a t1/2 of 12 h in no Act and 11 h in Day 5 activated CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Data 1). In addition, the GZMB 3'UTR contained only one high-confidence miCLIP-RRACH site in activated T cells (Supplementary Fig. S3G). As expected, FTO inhibition had no effect on the proportion of GFP-positive cells (Supplementary Fig. S3I). Noticeably, the MFI was significantly reduced in cells expressing the 3′UTR-IFNG  and 3′UTR-TNF constructs upon treatment with MA (Fig. 3G and Supplementary Fig. S3J). In contrast, GFP levels from the 3′UTR-GzmB construct remained unaltered by FTO inhibition (Fig. 3G and Supplementary Fig. S3J–K). In line with these results, secretion of endogenous IFNγ and TNFα proteins was also decreased following FTO inhibition during CD8+ T cell activation (Fig. 3H–I), without compromising overall T cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S3L). Although the GzmB 3′UTR did contain a putative miCLIP-ARE site, its signal intensity was comparable to that of the input control site, suggesting this site is not reliably associated with m6A modification (Supplementary Fig. S3G). These results indicate that m6A methylation promotes the decay of short-lived cytokine mRNAs, thereby attenuating effector protein expression in activated CD8⁺ T cells.

The impact of m⁶A on RNP assembly may depend on the additional regulatory motifs beyond the RRACH, including AREs. To independently validate whether ARE-flanking m6A sites can be directy m6A modified, we applied the single-base elongation and ligation-based qPCR amplification (SELECT) method, which exploits the decreased activity of DNA polymerases and nick ligation to m6A bases64. We focused on the 3′UTR of the TNF mRNA, given the importance of the cytokine TNFα for CD8+ T cell function3,7 and because it contains a clear miCLIP-ARE site (AUUUAUUA) located within 15 nucleotides of a RRACH (AGACA) motif (Supplementary Fig. S3E). We designed SELECT primers for the TNF 3'UTR that targeted the miCLIP-ARE site and a distal unmodified adenosine (A) as a reference site, located within 5 nucleotides of a high-confidence miCLIP-RRACH site and 85 nucleotides away from the miCLIP-ARE site (Supplementary Fig. S3E). For SELECT experiments, we adjusted the amount of input RNA based on the qPCR amplification. We then compared the SELECT qPCR amplification curves of primary human CD8+ T control cells and CD8+ T cells with knockout (KO) of either METTL3 methyltransferase (METTL3-KO) or FTO demethylase (FTO-KO) (Supplementary Fig. S3B). While we did not observe differences in amplification curves between control and METTL3-KO CD8+ T cells at the reference site (Fig. 3J), we found greater amplification at the target miCLIP-ARE site in METTL3-KO cells (Fig. 3K, L), indicating lower m6A levels in the absence of METTL3. Conversely, comparison of WT and FTO-KO CD8+ T cells revealed reduced amplification at the miCLIP-ARE site (Supplementary Fig. S3M, N). We also observed a significant difference in amplification between METTL3-KO and FTO-KO cells at this site (Fig. 3L). These results show that the changes detected in the amplification curves were m6A dependent and sensitive to both METTL3 and FTO expression. These data provide orthogonal evidence for the existence of METTL3-dependent m6A modifications at specific RRACH-flanking ARE sites, suggesting these composite motifs function as a distinct m⁶A regulatory unit. We then sought to determine the role of motif-specific m6A signatures identified in our miCLIP on transcript expression. We used the GFP reporter system to further investigate the role of each motif-specific miCLIP site in the 3'UTR of TNF. Specifically, we used either the GFP construct fused with the WT 3'UTR of TNF (3'UTR-TNF_WT) or with mutated forms of miCLIP sites (Supplementary Fig. S3O). The mutated TNF 3'UTRs we used had either a point mutation (A > G) at the miCLIP-ARE site (3'UTR-TNF_AREmut), a point mutation (A > G) at the miCLIP-RRACH site (3'UTR-TNF_RRACHmut) or two-point mutations at both sites (3'UTR-TNF_AREmut/RRACHmut) (Supplementary Fig. S3O). We then retrovirally transduced CD8+ T cells with the GFP 3'UTR-TNF constructs. To account for differences in transduction efficiency, we simultaneously transduced the CD8+ T cells with a construct that expressed Katushka under no 3'UTR control (Supplementary Fig. S3O). After transduction, the cells were rested (kept in culture for an additional 7–10 days), and the RNA levels of GFP and Katushka were measured. We found higher GFP mRNA levels in the presence of mutant miCLIP-ARE compared to mutant miCLIP-RRACH (Fig. 3M and Supplementary Fig. S3P). When both sites were mutated, we observed lower (P = 0.0546) mRNA levels compared to the mutant miCLIP-ARE (Fig. 3M and Supplementary Fig. S3P). To test the effect of the mutations on protein expression, we reactivated the transduced CD8+ T cells with PMA/ionomycin for 16 h and measured GFP levels before and after activation (Fig. 3N–P). As expected, GFP was undetectable in resting CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3N), although we could quantify GFP mRNA levels in the resting state (Fig. 3M). In contrast, following 16 h of activation, GFP protein levels increased across all conditions tested (Fig. 3N), with a higher intensity of GFP under mutant miCLIP-ARE conditions when compared to WT (P = 0.0508) and mutant miCLIP-RRACH (Fig. 3O, P). Katushka levels remained unchanged across conditions both before and after activation of transduced CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. S3Q–T). These results showed that the RRACH-flanking ARE site enhances mRNA decay only in the presence of intact RRACH sites capable of m6A modification. Interestingly, mutation of the RRACH site alone was insufficient to alter TNF mRNA levels, contrary to expectations based on the established role of RRACH in mRNA destabilization9. Collectively, these data lead to the hypothesis that the functional impact of m6A modifications may in some cases, depend on combinatorial recognition of methylated RRACH alongside its flanking ARE sites.

To investigate whether miCLIP-ARE sites modulate the recruitment of RBPs, we first examined the local enrichment of m6A in RNAs bound by specific ARE-binding proteins. We performed CLIP experiments in Jurkat T cells using antibodies against canonical m6A-readers (YTHDF1 and YTHDF2) and ARE-binding proteins relevant to T cell biology (HuR, ZFP36). Crosslinked RNA fragments were isolated and analysed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC‒MS/MS) to quantify m6A and adenosine (A) levels (LC‒MS/MS) (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Use of Jurkat T cells in these experiments provided sufficient material to reproducibly detect m6A ribonucleosides by LC-MS/MS, which could not be achieved with primary T cells due to lower RNA yield (see note in Methods). We found that the m6A/A ratio was elevated in RNAs bound to YTHDF1/2, HuR and ZFP36, compared to those bound by the polyA-binding protein (PAPB), which preferentially interacts with A-rich sequences. This indicates that m6A is enriched in RNA regions bound by both m6A-readers and ARE-binding RBPs. Of note, the input RNA (total crosslinked RNA) showed an intermediate m6A/A ratio relative to the PABP-bound RNAs (Supplementary Fig. S4A).

To assess how the presence of m6A influences RNA–protein interactions close to AREs, we performed quantitative mass spectrometry-based RNA interactome capture using synthetic RNA probes designed to mimic key sequence contexts identified by miCLIP and GLORI profiling, as previously described65. Specifically, we tested RNA oligonucleotides containing either the canonical m6A-modified RRACH motif (GGACU) or a composite motif in which a UUAUU (ARE) pentamer was immediately flanked upstream by a RRACH sequence. Unmethylated versions of each probe served as controls. The methylation was placed directly on the central adenosine of the ARE (AGACU-Um⁶AUU), inspired by the original miCLIP signal. Although GLORI data showed that m6A sites are located within RRACH rather than ARE, our probes nevertheless capture the composite architecture of ARE-flanking RRACH sites to allow comparison with RRACH-only probes. We performed a forward pulldown, wherein immobilised A and m6A probes were first incubated with human T cell lysates. After incubation and washes, bound proteins were digested and then differentially labelled with light (A bait pull-down) and medium (m6A bait pull-down) dimethyl isotopes, respectively. We also performed a label swap experiment, which serves as a replicate measurement (reverse). We determined the M/L ratio of bound proteins for the forward and reverse pulldowns, such that m6A-readers are depicted in the upper right quadrant (high forward M/L ratio; low M/L ratio in the reverse experiment) (Fig. 4A, B and Supplementary Fig. S4B). As a control, we confirmed that YTH domain-containing proteins (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDC1 and YTHDC2) were more strongly bound to the m6A-modified GGACU probe than to the unmethylated GGACU probe (Fig. 4A), showing that one repeat of the m6A consensus sequence GGACU is sufficient to capture canonical m6A readers in T cells65. Conversely, we found that various members of the LSM family of RNA-binding proteins (LSM1, LSM2, LSM3, LSM4, and LSM6) specifically bound to m6A-modified UUAUU relative to the unmodified UUAUU probe (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4B). Interestingly, all the YTHDF paralogues were also significant readers of m6A-modified UUAUU sequences, whereas several more proteins were repelled by the m6A-modified UUAUU than by the unmodified GGACU probe (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4B). It has been reported that LSM proteins assemble into RNPs that facilitate pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA degradation66. To test whether miCLIP-ARE sites recruit specific RBPs in a biological sequence context, we performed pulldown experiments targeting the TNF 3'UTR, where the m6A-modified (and unmodified) probes contained a UUAUU pentamer surrounded by a sequence (15 nt upstream and downstream) corresponding to the respective region of the TNF 3'UTR. The TNF 3'UTR probe contained the miCLIP-ARE site flanked downstream by a RRACH site (UUm6AUUACCCCCUCCUUCAGACA, see complete probe in Methods), as assayed above (Supplementary Fig. S3E).

Fold-changes were calculated relative to the corresponding unmethylated probe. Data represent one representative experiment from pooled human T cells (n = 9 donors). D Metagene distribution of published CLIP data for m6A-reader proteins67 at endogenous miCLIP-defined sites. Left: CLIP signal centred at miCLIP-ARE sites, stratified by whether a RRACH motif occurs within ± 50 nt. Right: CLIP signal centred at miCLIP-RRACH sites, stratified by whether an ARE occurs within ± 50 nt. E Model illustrating how canonical (RRACH-only) versus composite (ARE-flanking m6A) motifs differentially regulate mRNA decay. Composite motifs, defined by m⁶A at RRACH elements positioned within ± 4 nt of ARE pentamers, promote rapid mRNA destabilisation during T cell activation. These composite sites recruit a distinct set of RBPs compared to canonical RRACH-only m6A sites, enabling selective decay of immunoregulatory mRNAs in activated T cells.

Similarly to Fig. 4B, YTH paralogues and the LSM family of proteins were found to bind specifically to the m6A-modified TNF probe (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S4C). Finally, to determine whether the high-confidence ARE-flanking m6A sites identified by miCLIP and GLORI profiling could serve as binding sites for canonical m6A readers, we checked the iCLIP data for YTHDF, YTHDC paralogues, RBM15 and RBM15b67. We observed that YTHDF1 binding sites, as defined by published unique iCLIP tags67, were enriched at both miCLIP-ARE and miCLIP-RRACH sites, but not at control ARE or RRACH sites lacking miCLIP signal (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S4D, E). Control sites were expression-matched to the miCLIP sites by selecting 3'UTRs from the DESeq2 model that were expressed in CD8+ T cells but showed low miCLIP signal for the respective motifs (Supplementary Fig. S4D). Surprisingly, unique YTHDF tags were also detected at miCLIP-CRACH sites, however, due to their low number, it is difficult to interpret this distribution (Supplementary Fig. S4D). Notably, YTHDF1 binding showed a prominent central peak at miCLIP-AREs flanked by RRACH ( ≤ 50nt) but not at isolated miCLIP-AREs (Fig. 4D). Enriched central peak was observed at both classes of miCLIP-RRACH sites, but we noticed somewhat broader crosslinking profile at RRACHs that were proximal to ARE motifs (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S4E). Collectively, these data show that m6A-modified AREs can recruit LSM proteins and YTHDF proteins, which may cooperatively alter mRNA decay through YTHDF-dependent pathways. These findings support a model in which RRACH-flanking AREs form composite m6A motifs that assemble distinct RNP complexes to more strongly promote mRNA destabilisation in activated CD8⁺ T cells as compared to the RRACH-only m6A sites (Fig. 4E).

The degradation of mRNAs is an essential aspect of the regulation of transcript numbers68. This is ever more important for dosage-sensitive genes, such as cytokines, for which small fluctuations in rates of mRNA decay can have significant effects on mRNA and protein abundance6. In T cells, the tight regulation of cytokine expression is required to ensure early and transient responses, since aberrant cytokine production can lead to severe autoimmune diseases, while insufficient cytokine levels cause impaired antitumor responses3. Here, through a motif discovery analysis and supervised learning approach on miCLIP/GLORI and SLAM-seq data, we have identified ARE-flanking m6A motifs that mark immunoregulatory mRNAs for rapid decay in activated CD8+ T cells.

In this study, we apply an improved miCLIP protocol, motif discovery analysis (PEKA) and GLORI profiling to find that m6A-modified RRACHs are often flanked by AREs (Fig. 1C, D). The closest arrangement is a RRACH sequence (e.g., GAACU) directly next to an ARE (e.g., AUUUA) to form a hypothetical AUUUAGAACU or GAACUAUUUA motif. The sequence required for METTL3-dependent m6A methylation44,48 can thus partly overlap with an ARE-like sequence, likely an atypical class III ARE4.

The molecular effects of m6A-modified RRACHs on mRNA degradation range from subtle to profound9,53. Understanding the specificity of this process would enable more precise identification of m6A variants that regulate basic cell functions. We reasoned that a low frequency of m6A sites in non-RRACH motifs does not indicate a lack of biological importance, since cellular responses may require subsets of mRNAs whose stability depends on different regulatory mechanisms. CD8+ T cell activation is a crucial process that relies on the tight control of cytokine and inflammatory mRNA levels and is largely achieved by ARE-binding proteins3,7. However, how ARE-mediated mRNA decay is integrated with other mechanisms, including RNA modifications, to define T cell functions is not understood. Through a supervised learning approach on miCLIP/GLORI and SLAM-seq data, we revealed that CD8+ T cell activation leads to faster decay of mRNAs harbouring ARE-proximal m6A modifications. We refer to these highly unstable transcripts as meta-unstable mRNAs, reflecting their dynamic reduction in half-life. This reduction occurs predominantly upon CD8⁺ T cell activation. This group includes key essential mRNAs for CD8+ T cell function (Fig. 2A – cluster 2, 2E – cluster i, Supplementary Data 1). Notably, the meta-unstable mRNAs were more accurately predicted by ARE-proximal m6A sites than by remaining m6A sites. This composite m6A motif, defined by RRACH-flanking ARE sites, may constitute a distinct regulatory unit for m6A-dependent mRNA decay. We tested this model using orthogonal approaches and targeted assays focused on key immunoregulatory genes. We employed SELECT studies to add orthogonal evidence of the presence of m6A in a specific RRACH-flanking ARE site in the TNF 3'UTR (Supplementary Fig. S3E). GFP reporter assays showed that a single-nucleotide mutation of the ARE site of 3'UTR-TNF led to increased mRNA levels only in the presence of an intact RRACH site, but not when mutating both the RRACH and ARE sites. It should be noted that the reporter assays are insufficient to fully disentangle m6A-dependent effects from other sequence-dependent influences on mRNA levels (Fig. 3). Notably, some ARE-binding RBPs, such as HuR69 may be able to bind to both the wild-type ARE (UUAUU) and its mutant (UUGUU) sequences in the reporter. On the other hand, it is possible that the A > G mutation in the 3'UTR-TNF_AREmut may impair the binding of ARE-binding RBPs regardless of m6A status. Nevertheless, our findings show that mRNA meta-instability of the TNF and other immunoregulatory mRNAs likely depends on the interplay between RBPs binding to m6A sites and their flanking ARE motifs.

We present two lines of evidence that ARE-flanking m6A sites and canonical RRACHs have different efficacy on mRNA decay CD8+ T cells, likely due to the formation of somewhat distinct m6A-dependent ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. First, using cellular extracts of T cells, we show that ARE-flanking m6A sites recruit YTHDF paralog proteins along with additional RBPs, especially the LSM proteins66. Importantly, LSM4, a highly enriched RBP according to our interaction screening, was recently shown to bind TNF mRNA in T cells after activation70. Second, analysis of YTHDF1/2/3 binding profiles67 showed that YTHDF paralogs show a somewhat broader crosslink profile to the composite sites with AREs flanked by the methylated RRACH sites when compared to isolated RRACH sites, consistent with Arabidopsis iCLIP data showing that m6A-modified RRACH motifs are favoured in pyrimidine-rich regions71. While all three YTHDF paralogs are known to contribute to the degradation of m6A-modified mRNAs, two studies have indicated that YTHDF2 plays a main role in mRNA decay through two pathways: (1) the endoribonucleolytic-cleavage pathway via RNaseP/MRP72 and (2) the CCR4/NOT deadenylation pathway73. However, whether and to what degree the RnaseP/MRP and CCR4/NOT pathways operate differently on meta-unstable mRNAs with different m6A signatures has not been addressed here. Moreover, whether m6A-interlinked ARE and RRACH sites work cooperatively or in opposing ways on specific mRNAs was not determined, and merits further consideration.

Beyond the molecular basis of mRNA decay, our study links m6A to meta-unstable mRNAs that are involved in memory and late effector functions (Fig. 2)56,74. Since m6A and TNFα play important roles in antitumor immunity, it will be relevant to assess whether ARE sites functionally linked to m6A influence T cell differentiation and activity. Taken together, the findings support a model whereby ARE-flanking m6A sites recruit distinct regulatory RNP assemblies that enable selective decay of memory precursor and late effector transcripts in T cells. This context-dependent m6A code reveals how combinatorial RNA motifs can fine-tune transcript stability in response to activation cues in CD8+ T cells. Further understanding of the mechanisms mediating the combinatorial recognition of m6A and its flanking ARE sites could lead to valuable approaches for fine-tuning the immune system.

Human CD8+ T cells were isolated either directly after blood donation (8-12 h after blood collection) or cryopreserved and used after cryopreservation. PBMCs were isolated through Ficoll-Paque PLUS density gradient separation (GE Healthcare). The cells were incubated in 21% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide at 37 °C. Sex, gender or age were not determined for any of the donors.

For miCLIP and SLAM-Seq experiments, human CD8+ T cells were isolated with MACS Miltenyi kits (total CD8+ T cells: 130-096-495; total CD8+ MicroBeads: 130-045-201; and total FcR-blocking: 130-059-901) following the manufacturer's instructions. CD8+ T cells were activated with aCD3/CD28 beads (1:1 bead-to-cell ratio) (11132D, Gibco) in fresh complete RPMI media (52400-025; Gibco) containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin‒streptomycin and IL-2 (30 μ/ml; Roche).

For GLORI experiments, human CD8+ T cells were isolated with the MACS Miltenyi kit (total CD8+ MicroBeads: 130-045-201) following the manufacturer's instructions. CD8+ T cells were either kept non-activated for 1 day or were activated with aCD3/CD28 beads (1:1 bead-to-cell ratio) (11132D, Gibco) in fresh complete RPMI media (52400-025; Gibco) containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin‒streptomycin and IL-2 (30 μ/ml; Clinigen) for 1 or 5 days. Non-activated and Day1 activated cells were treated for 24 h with DMSO or 4 µM METTL3 inhibitor (MedChemExpress, cat. no. HY-134836), while Day5 activated T cells were treated with the same inhibitor for 5 days. For Day 5 activated samples, beads were removed at day 4 and fresh medium was replenished twice during culture.

For the CRISPR/Cas9 and SELECT experiments, human CD8+ T cells were isolated with MACS Miltenyi kits (total CD8+ T cells: 130-096-495; total CD8+ MicroBeads: 130-045-201; and total FcR-blocking: 130-059-901) following the manufacturer's instructions. CD8+ T cells were activated in 24-well plates precoated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG2a (BioLegend) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The plates were washed and coated for > 3 h with 1 μg/ml a-CD3 (HIT3a, Biolegend) at 37 °C. The CD8+ T cells were then seeded in plates supplemented with 1 μg/ml soluble a-CD28 (CD28.2; Biolegend) in fresh complete RPMI media (52400-025; Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin‒streptomycin and IL-2 (30 μ/ml; Clinigen).

For RNA pull-down and GFP construct transduction experiments, human T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+) were activated in 24-well plates that were precoated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG2a (BioLegend) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The plates were washed and coated for > 3 h with 1 μg/ml a-CD3 (HIT3a, Biolegend) at 37 °C. The CD8+ T cells were then seeded in plates supplemented with 1 μg/ml soluble a-CD28 (CD28.2; Biolegend) in fresh complete RPMI media (52400-025; Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin‒streptomycin and IL-2 (30 μ/ml; Clinigen). For GFP construct transduction experiments, the number of GFP-positive or Katushka-positive CD8+ T cells was determined via flow cytometry. For the RNA pull-down experiment, T cells were isolated from 9 donors, activated and expanded separately for 7 days. On day 7, the cells were pooled in three falcons (3 donors in each pool). After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, and 1 x protease inhibitor), incubated on a rotator at 4 °C for 2 h, and centrifuged, after which the supernatant was collected in new tubes that were snap frozen.

For inhibitor treatments, T cells were treated with either DMSO or 6 µM METTL3 inhibitor (4 µM for GLORI datasets) (MedChemExpress, cat no. HY-134836) for 4 to 5 days. Media refreshment was done every 1-2 days. For the FTO inhibitor, T cells were treated with DMSO or increasing concentrations of Meclofenamate62 (sodium salt, Cayman Chemical, Item No. 70550) for 6-7 h before 16 h activation with PMA/ionomycin (for GFP reporter assays) or treated overnight (18 h) before 4 h activation (for ELISA assays).

For the Katuska construct, the pMIG-w (Addgene) plasmid was used as a backbone, and the Katushka sequence was integrated by using the NcoI and PacI restriction enzymes. For GFP 3'UTR-IFNγ, 3'UTR-TNFα and 3'UTR-GzmB plasmids, the full-length 3'UTR of each gene was amplified from human genomic DNA and cloned into BamHI and NotI sites of pRETRO-SUPER GFP downstream of GFP, as previously described70. The single and double mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis via Twist Bioscience (https://www.twistbioscience.com). The sequences were verified by sequencing.

The viral supernatant was collected after transfecting FLYRD18 cells (retroviral packaging cells) with the GFP-3'UTR or Katushka plasmids using GeneJammer as a transfection reagent. The viral supernatant was collected 2 days after transfection. T cells were isolated and activated as described above. After 2 days of activation, T cells were co-transduced with retrovirus containing one of the GFP-3'UTR constructs or with retrovirus containing the Katushka construct at a ratio of 1:1. Nontissue culture–treated 24-well plates were coated overnight with 50 μg/ml RetroNectin (Takara) and washed once with PBS prior to the addition of both viral supernatants. The plates were centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C and 2820 x g. The viral supernatant was removed, and 0.5 × 106 T cells were added to each well. The cells were harvested 1-2 days after transduction and cultured at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml for an additional 6–8 days. Rested cells (not reactivated) were collected for RNA isolation and RT‒PCR analysis. For flow cytometry analysis of protein levels, cells were either reactivated with PMA (10 ng/ml) or ionomycin (1 μM) for 16 h or left non-activated. Flow cytometry was performed as described below.

Total RNA was extracted from isolated T cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen), Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kits (Zymo Research, R2052), or Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, R1055), and 300–500 ng of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis (SuperScript III, Invitrogen or Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-qPCR, K1641, Thermo Fisher). All kits were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were run in technical triplicates. qRT‒PCR was performed using SYBR Green on a StepOne Plus system (Applied Biosystems). Ct values were normalised to HPRT or 18S levels. The primer sequences can be found in the “Key Resources Table”.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were thawed, and CD8+ T cells were isolated using a CD8⁺ isolation kit (CD8+ MicroBeads, 130-045-201, Miltenyi biotec). Isolated cells were activated using anti-CD3/CD28 activation beads (Dynabeads™ Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 for T Cell Expansion and Activation, 11131D, ThermoFisher Scientific) and cultured in T cell medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with L-glutamine and 25 mM HEPES (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat no. 52400-025) supplemented with 10% FCS, 10,000 μ/ml penicillin-10 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma, cat no P4333), and human IL-2 (30 μ/mL). Cells were treated with either DMSO or 6 µM METTL3 inhibitor (MedChemExpress, cat no. HY-134836) for 4 or 5 days. Media refreshment was done every 1-2 days. Activation beads were removed on day 4. On day 5, cells were treated with 5 μg/mL actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No A9415) for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 hrs to assess RNA stability. Subsequently, cells were washed with cold PBS, centrifuged, and the resulting pellets were snap-frozen and stored at − 80 °C until further analysis. RNA was extracted as mentioned above and qRT-PCR followed for quantification of mRNA levels.

Secreted IFNγ and TNFa levels of CD8+ T cells were determined using ELISA. Assays were performed with uncoated ELISA kits (Catalog No. 88-7316-88; 88-7346-88 ThermoFisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance was determined using a microplate reader (Sunrise, Tecan) at a wavelength of 450 nm.

crRNAs were designed in Benchling (https://benchling.com) and are listed in the “Key Resources Table”. The Alt-R crRNA and tracr-RNA were reconstituted to 100 μM in nuclease-free duplex buffer (Integrated DNA Technologies). As a negative control, the nontargeting negative control crRNA #1 was used (Integrated DNA Technologies). Oligos were mixed at equimolar ratios (i.e., 4.5 μl of total crRNA + 4.5 μl of tracrRNA) in nuclease-free PCR tubes and denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in a thermocycler. The nucleic acids were cooled to room temperature prior to mixing with 30 μg of TrueCut Cas9 V2 (Invitrogen) to produce Cas9 ribonuclear proteins (RNPs). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for at least 10 min prior to nucleofection. For nucleofection, human CD8+ T cells were activated for 48 h as described above. Cells were electroporated in 16-well strips in a 4D Nucleofector X unit (Lonza) with the programme EH100 for human T cells with P2 Primary Cell buffer (Lonza). Knockout efficiency was determined on days 7–10 after electroporation by Western blot.

The elongation and ligation-based qPCR amplification method SELECT was used as previously described64. Specifically, CD8+ T cells were isolated from healthy individuals, activated and cultured as described above. On day 2 after activation, the cells were genetically modified with CRISPR/Cas9 as described above and further cultured for an additional 8–12 days. The amount of RNA for each sample and each target was previously verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT–PCR), and the same amount of RNA was used for SELECT (normalised to the WT control). Specifically, to validate a presumed m6A site, two primers (up and down primers) were designed to flank the site of interest via Benchling (https://benchling.com). A nonm6A site on the same mRNA was also tested as a reference control (Reference Up and Down primers). The sequences of all primers used are listed in the “Key Resources Table”. Total RNA (1.5 μg) was used per experiment. The RNA was mixed with 40 nM Up Primer, 40 nM Down Primer and 5 μM dTTP in a total of 17 μl of 1 × CutSmart buffer (NEB). The RNA and primers were annealed by incubating the mixture at a temperature gradient of 90 °C for 1 min, 80 °C for 1 min, 70 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 40 °C for 6 min. Subsequently, 3 μl of a mixture containing 0.01 U of Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase, 0.5 U of SplintR ligase and 10 nmol of ATP was added to the former mixture to a final volume of 20 μl. The final reaction was incubated at 40 °C for 20 min, denatured at 80 °C for 20 min and kept at 4 °C. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was subsequently performed with the primers qPCR_F and qPCR_R for SELECT (200 nM; sequences at “Key Resources Table”) and with PowerUp SYBR Green on a StepOne Plus system (Applied Biosystems). For the qPCR, 2–4 μl of the elongation and ligation samples were used. qPCR was performed under the following conditions: 95 °C, 5 min; 95 °C, 10 s; 60 °C, 35 s, 40 cycles; 95 °C, 15 s; 60 °C, 1 min; 95 °C, 15 s (for which the fluorescence was collected at a ramping rate of 0.05 °C/s); and 4 °C. The data were analysed by Design & Analysis 2 (DA2) Software v2.6.0 (Thermo Scientific).

The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and stained with antibodies in FACS Buffer (5% FBS, 2 mM EDTA in PBS) at 4 °C for 30–60 min. The stained cells were washed with FACS buffer 2–3 times and processed for flow cytometry. The emission spectra “spillover” were corrected by compensation using compensation beads (01-1111-41; OneComp eBeads) mixed with each fluorescent probe. The BD LSR-Fortessa and BD FACSymphony flow cytometers and the Sony Spectra Analyser were used. The flow cytometry data were analysed using FlowJo (BD Biosciences, version 10). The antibodies used can be found in the “Key Resources Table”.

Human CD8+ T cells were isolated, activated and engineered by CRISPR/Cas9 as described above. A total of 3 × 106 cells were collected, washed and pelleted. The cell pellets were incubated with urea-tris buffer (8 mol/L urea, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L β-mercaptoethanol) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min. The proteins were separated via SDS‒PAGE and subsequently transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were then blocked in 5% milk prepared in PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature the next day. Following ECL exposure (Invitrogen), the membranes were imaged using an iBrightCL1000 (Thermo Fisher). The antibodies used can be found in the “Key Resources Table”.

We applied miCLIP (methylation individual-nucleotide-resolution crosslinking and immunoprecipitation)25,26 to profile m6A using the latest improved iCLIP protocol (iiCLIP)36 to produce cDNA libraries with increased efficiency and minimal loss of material. Compared to previous (m)iCLIP versions, this protocol features (i) the use of DMSO (and no DTT) for improved ligation efficiency; (ii) infrared imaging of the RNA:anti-m6A antibody complex, as in irCLIP75; (iii) reverse transcription (RT) with SSIV and RT primers that contain carbon spacers, as in irCLIP; (iv) ampure bead-based purification of cDNAs; and (v) circularisation with commercial circligase II with betaine additive. The miCLIP protocol is completed from UV crosslinking to amplify cDNA libraries within 4 days.

RNA extraction and fragmentation (Day 0): Total RNA was extracted from CD8+ T cells using the mirVana isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #AM1560), purified polyadenylated RNA was extracted using two rounds of poly(A) tail hybridisation with Oligo-dT magnetic Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #61002), and fragmented (750–1000 ng) in a buffered zinc acetate solution (pH 5.3) at 70 °C for 15 min (pH 5.3).

Immunoprecipitation (IP), UV crosslinking and SeqRv adaptor ligation (Day 1): The fragmented polyadenylated RNA was subjected to IP using an anti-m6A antibody (Ab) (Abcam, catalogue no. ab151230) conjugated to protein A/G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. 88803) for 2 h at 4 °C. The RNA:Ab complex was irradiated twice with 150 mJ/cm2 UV at 254 nm, and the cDNA library was prepared as described previously36. After IP, the (protein A/G) beads were washed twice in high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Igepal, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and twice in PNK (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2% Tween-20) buffer. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min for 3' end dephosphorylation; the beads were washed with 1 x ligation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mM MgCl2), and 3' end ligation to an infrared dye-conjugated and biotinylated L3 adaptor (SeqRv) was performed on the beads overnight at 16 °C with shaking at 150 g.

SeqRv adaptor removal, SDS‒PAGE and RNA purification (Day 2): The 3' end-ligated RNA:Ab complex on the beads was washed twice in high-salt buffer and twice in PNK wash buffer, and the excess SeqRv adaptor was removed by resuspending the beads in a mixture of 5' deadenylase (NEB) and RecJf exonuclease (NEB) for 30 min at 30 °C followed by 30 min at 37 °C while shaking at 150 g. The beads were washed twice with high-salt buffer and once with PNK buffer, and the protein‒RNA complexes were eluted in 1x NuPAGE loading buffer (supplemented with 100 mM DTT) at 70 °C for 1 min. The protein‒RNA complexes were separated via SDS‒PAGE in a 4‒12% Bis‒Tris gel (Invitrogen), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h at 30 V, and visualised via infrared imaging. The RNA:Ab complex was excised from the membrane, treated with proteinase K (which leaves only a short peptide at the crosslinking site) for 1 h at 50 °C with shaking at 150 g, and the RNA was purified by adding a (25:24:1) mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (Sigma‒Aldrich). The mixture was subsequently transferred to a prespun 2 ml Phase Lock Gel tube and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C with shaking at 150 g. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 21,000 × g, chloroform was added to the top (aqueous) phase of the biphasic solution, and the tubes were inverted to mix and centrifuged for 5 min at 21,000 × g. The aqueous layer was transferred into a new tube, and the RNA was precipitated overnight in 70% ethanol containing 300 mM sodium acetate and 1 μl of glycogen blue (15 mg/ml).

Reverse transcription, cDNA purification and circularisation (Day 3): The RNA pellets were washed twice in 70% ethanol, resuspended in water and reverse transcribed into cDNA with barcoded RT primers (which contained a sequence complementary to the SeqRv adaptor) using the Superscript IV (SSIV) Kit. To minimise technical variations in library preparation, we multiplexed up to four CLIP libraries after the RT step using barcoded RT primers. We did not perform RT primer removal because this step was not tested or incorporated into the iiCLIP protocol at the time of this study. The cDNAs were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads, circularised using CircLigase II with betaine additive, purified again using the AMPure XP beads, eluted in water and stored at − 20 °C.

PCR amplification (Day 4) – The cDNA was amplified using an optimal number of cycles in PhusionHF Master Mix containing P3/P5 Illumina sequencing primers.

We applied a similar protocol to generate input libraries, in which 750–1000 ng of polyadenylated RNA was fragmented, directly processed for 3' end dephosphorylation, converted into cDNA and amplified as described above.

The miCLIP and input data were uploaded and analysed on the FlowBio platform (https://app.flow.bio) using a standardised iCLIP analysis described therein76: demultiplexing (https://app.flow.bio/pipelines/447171969201517470/) followed by the CLIP-Seq (https://app.flow.bio/pipelines/960154035051242353/) pipeline. Using the CLIP-Seq pipeline as described previously https://docs.flow.bio/docs/clip-pipeline-1.0/, (1) the 3' end of the reads were trimmed for the 3' end adaptor sequence (AGATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAG) by TrimGalore; (2) the reads were pre-mapped to an index of rRNA and tRNA sequences using Bowtie; (3) the unmapped reads were mapped to the human genome (GRCh38) using STAR; (4) the aligned reads were deduplicated based on the unique molecular identifiers (UMI) and start position; (5) the start position minus one in uniquely mapped reads was used as a proxy for the crosslink position, i.e., the most likely site of the methylated base25,47, and crosslink bed files were produced; and (6) the peaks were determined using Paraclu and Clippy peak callers. The GRCh38 GENCODE annotation was used for all human data. Other summary files reporting total crosslink counts in genes and RNA biotypes and quality control metrics presented as a MultiQC report were generated by the CLIP-Seq pipeline; all files from the miCLP and Input samples are retrievable at https://app.flow.bio/projects/663588932565340992/. We applied positionally enriched k-mer analysis (PEKA) to extract motifs that were enriched in proximity to high-confidence crosslink sites, i.e., ‘thresholded crosslinks', located within crosslink peaks and with high counts relative to low-count crosslink sites located outside the peaks42. We used crosslinks and peaks (generated by Paraclu or Clippy) as inputs for PEKA; we ran PEKA by setting the proximal window to 10 nt (-w 10), the distal window to 150 nt (-dw 150), the k-mer length to 5 nt (-k 5), the smoothing window to 6 nt (-s 6), the percentile parameter for assignment of thresholded crosslinks to 0.7 (-p 0.7), and without subsampling of foreground and background crosslinks (https://github.com/ulelab/peka). Each k-mer at the “thresholded crosslink” position was assigned a PEKA score42, and the top 20 k-mers were plotted based on the PEKA scores and P-value of less than 0.01 (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S1B). We defined “PEKA crosslinks” as the number of crosslinks that overlap with the genomic positions of ‘thresholded PEKA crosslinks'. To check the alignment at motif centres (Fig. 1), the PEKA crosslinks were normalised at each meta position in the 3'UTR by the total number of crosslinks in the 3'UTR. We used PEKA crosslinks in the 3'UTR for all other analyses (Fig. 2) unless otherwise noted.

Human CD8⁺ T cell pellets from 6 donors were lysed in TRIzol, and total RNA was isolated using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kits (Zymo Research, cat. no. R2052) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was assessed with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). The RNA of donors was pooled in 2 (not activated) or 3 (Day 1 and Day 5 activated) samples. GLORI libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, cat. no. E7760S). The protocol uses a dUTP-based method for second-strand synthesis, resulting in strand-specific libraries in which Read 2 corresponds to the sense strand of the original RNA. Library preparation was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions, and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by the Advanced Sequencing Facility at The Francis Crick Institute. Downstream analyses were performed using the second read (L5_2) of each pair, which contains the chemically informative read for m⁶A detection. Adaptor trimming was performed using Trim Galore (v0.6.7) with the following parameters: -q 20 --stringency 1 -e 0.3 --length 20. Reads shorter than 20 nucleotides after trimming were discarded. The remaining high-quality reads were aligned to an A > G converted version of the human genome (GRCh38) using GLORI-tools (https://github.com/liucongcas/GLORI-tools), which accommodates the chemical reactivity-based profiling of m6A through misincorporation signals. Strand-specific pileups for all four nucleotides (A, C, G, T) were generated directly from the resulting BAM files. Per-base coverage and A-to-G or T-to-C conversion ratios were computed and exported as both BigWig and BedGraph files to facilitate visualisation in IGV or related genome browsers. Conversion ratios were calculated as A/(A + G) for the forward strand and T/(T + C) for the reverse strand. To identify putative m6A sites, pileup data were processed in R using the GenomicRanges package, focusing on positions with reference A or T located within ± 2 kb of annotated protein-coding genes (Ensembl release 113). These positions were further annotated for overlap with canonical m6A motifs (GAC, GAAC) and their reverse complements. Transcript-level mapping was performed using the annotatePeakInBatch() function from ChIPpeakAnno, enabling transcript-level annotation. Given that a single site can map to multiple transcripts or genes, redundancy was handled by tracking unique “position_id” fields to identify and filter duplicate entries. Additional genomic context was assigned using genomicElementDistribution() (ChIPpeakAnno), classifying sites at three hierarchical levels: transcript-level regions (promoter, downstream, gene body), exon–intron boundaries, and exon subtypes (5′UTR, CDS, 3′UTR, or other noncoding exons within protein-coding genes). To increase specificity, we applied two filtering criteria: (i) a minimum read depth of ≥ 15 for A + G (or T + C on the reverse strand) and (ii) a minimum base conversion ratio (A/(A + G) or T/(T + C)) of ≥ 0.1. The resulting datasets were saved as GRanges objects in.rds format for downstream meta-analysis in R. Supporting files, including gene annotations in GTF format, motif coordinates, genomic distribution plots, and conversion rate boxplots, were made for visualisation and further analysis. This integrated pipeline enabled the identification and annotation of GLORI-defined m6A sites across the CD8+ T cell transcriptome.

SLAM-Seq experiments were conducted as previously described52 with certain modifications. Specifically, CD8+ T cells were isolated from two healthy donors as described above. The cells were either not activated or activated with aCD3/CD28 beads (1:1 bead-to-cell ratio). Both non-activated and activated cells were cultured in fresh complete RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin‒streptomycin and IL-2 (30 μ/ml). Approximately 10 × 106 cells were used per condition. For non-activated and day 1 activated cells, 100 μM 4SU (T4509; Sigma) was added to the culture medium every 4 h for 24 h in total. The cells were then collected and washed with warm media. After centrifugation, the cells were plated in fresh RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin‒streptomycin, IL-2 and 100 mM uridine (U3750; Sigma). After the addition of uridine, the cells were further cultured for 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6 and 16 h. At each of the above time points, 1-2 × 106 cells were harvested, the activation beads were removed, and the RNA was isolated. For day 5 of activation, CD8+ T cells were activated for 4 days, after which the activation beads were removed, and 4SU was added as described above. After 24 h of 4SU, the cells were washed, further cultured with uridine and harvested at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 16 h. Total RNA was extracted from human CD8⁺ T cells after each chase time point using TRIzol reagent, followed by column-based purification. RNA integrity was assessed by Bioanalyzer (Agilent). SLAM-seq libraries were generated as previously described52, with minor modifications. In brief, thiol-modified RNA was chemically alkylated to introduce T > C mutations detectable by NGS. Libraries were prepared from total RNA using the Lexogen QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD, V2 (Cat. No. 191.96, Lexogen GmbH), which produces forward-stranded Illumina-compatible libraries enriched for the 3′ ends of polyadenylated transcripts. The workflow consists of oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription from the poly(A) tail, selective degradation of RNA, and second-strand synthesis primed by random oligonucleotides carrying Illumina linker sequences to preserve strand specificity. Final cDNA libraries were PCR-amplified, purified, quantified, assessed for quality using an Agilent Bioanalyzer, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 by the Advanced Sequencing Facility at The Francis Crick Institute. To calculate mRNA T > C conversions, the analysis pipeline was implemented using Snakemake 5.3.077. Sequencing reads were demultiplexed with Cutadapt 1.18, with no allowed mismatches in the barcodes, quality-filtered with a cutoff of Q20, trimmed of the barcodes (cut 12), and short reads were discarded (length 16). Polyadenylated stretches (> 4) at the 3' end were trimmed to 20 tandems without indels or mismatches. The trimmed reads were aligned to the reference human genome (GRCh38) using the Slamdunk map 0.3.378 with local alignment, allowing up to 100 multimapping reads (-n 100). Aligned reads were filtered to retain only those with a minimum identity of 95% and at least 50% of the read bases mapped. Reads ambiguously mapping to more than one 3' UTR were discarded using the UTR annotation pipeline (https://github.com/AmeresLab/UTRannotation). SNPs were identified using VarScan 2.4.179 with default parameters, establishing a 10-fold coverage cutoff and a variant fraction cutoff of 0.8 (-c 10-f 0.8). T > C conversions overlapping with SNPs required a minimum base quality (Phred score) of 26. T > C conversions were counted in rolling windows, normalised by T content and coverage of each position, and averaged per possible transcript 3' UTR. The quality of the T > C conversions was assessed using Slamdunk Alyoop 0.3.378. To calculate mRNA half-lives, T > C conversions were background-subtracted, normalised to the chase uridine treatment and fitted to an exponential decay model using the R package minpack.lm 1.280. The mRNA half-lives that correlated with the model (R² > 0.5) under all the experimental conditions were determined by t1/2 = ln(2)/k, where k is the decay constant in the monoexponential model. Using this approach, we determined accurate half-lives for 4158, 5585 and 5866 transcripts in activated CD8+ T cells on day 1 and day 5, respectively.

The total number of PEKA crosslinks per 3'UTR was normalised using the DESeq2 model (DESeq factor), transformed using the variance stabilisation function (vst) and standardised (centred and scaled). The top 1000 3'UTRs with the highest variability of DESeq2-normalised counts across samples were clustered based on the Euclidean distance of counts and plotted on the heatmap. DESeq2 normalisation was applied to the number of PEKA crosslinks in each motif class (RRACH or WWWWW pentamers; a ‘W” centre was considered for DESeq2 analyses, instead of ‘A'), summed across the 3'UTR and to the corresponding input counts, i.e., input reads that started at the same coordinates, also summed across the 3'UTR. We excluded four input replicates from the DESeq2 model (noAct, replicate 1 and 2; Day1, replicate 1; and Day5, replicate R3), due to the low number of counts (< 500) in the 3'UTR. All the miCLIP replicates (13 WWAWW and 13 RRACH samples) were considered for DESeq2 analysis. The same procedure was carried out for differential analysis of GLORI-determined m6A counts using the DESeq2 model. To classify mRNA half-lives, we considered all 3'UTRs in DESeq2 clusters that had reliable half-lives and selected the most unstable (< 3.0 h, 30 pth) and most stable (> 5.3 h, 70 pth) mRNAs. Using the caret package (6.0.94) in R, we trained a conditional random forest (cRF) model to classify unstable (N = 230) and stable (N = 230) mRNAs based on the following miCLIP features: 1–6) cluster identity, where the presence (1) or absence (0) of mRNA in each DESeq2 cluster was coded as a dummy variable (using the ifelse() function), 7) the CD8+ state (noAct, Day1 and Day5) and 8) CD8+ gene modules (A–G) as categorical variables, and two genomic features: 9) frequency of RRACH pentamers and 10) frequency of ARE (WWAWW) motifs. We generated 30 conditional random forest (cRF) models by randomly splitting the training set (75% of mRNAs) into 10 subsamples (k folds) of the same size (10-fold cross-validation) and computing the performance metric (accuracy) for each fold (k), with the remaining (k-1) of the folds used as training data; this process was repeated 3 times. The control parameters for the caret training were defined using the ‘caret::trainControl' function, with the main arguments (method = “repeatedcv”, number = 10, search = “random”, repeats = 3, p = 0.75, sampling = “down”, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary, classProbs = TRUE), and the cRF models (train object) generated using the ‘caret::train' function with arguments (method = ‘cforest', trControl = fit.control, metric = “Accuracy”, maximise = T, tuneLength = 10), with ‘fit.control' representing the R object with the control parameters defined above, and the number of predictors (mtry) was tuned for optimal model accuracy. The variable importance in the cRF models was determined using the ‘caret::varImp' function with arguments (scale = T, conditional = T). The cross-validation performance of the cRF models was determined using the ‘caret::confusionMatrix' function. The final class predictions of the cRF models were made by applying the “stats::predict” function to the test set (25% of the mRNAs). We generated cRF models to classify destabilised (log2-fold < − 0.73) and stabilised (log2-fold > 0.30) mRNAs in Day5-activated CD8+ T cells using the same approach, and the cross-validation performance was determined as above.

For CLIP–MS analysis of RBP-bound ribonucleosides, Jurkat T cells were UV-crosslinked, processed by CLIP, and the RNA was isolated and hydrolysed to ribonucleosides for LC-MS/MS analysis, as described below. The detected m6A ion counts were in the 0.5–5 fmol range, with signal-to-noise ratios of 15–30 relative to blanks. Although RBP abundance and regulation differ quantitatively between Jurkat and primary T cells, their qualitative RNA-binding profiles are broadly conserved across cell types (given similar expression)81, supporting the use of Jurkat T cells as a reductionist model for mechanistic studies of RBP binding and m6A methylation. The RNA:RBP complexes for the 4 RBPs (HuR, ZFP36L1, YTHDF1 and PABP) were purified from Jurkat T cells using the iiCLIP protocol, with the following specifications. Jurkat T cells were cultured in twelve 15 cm culture plates (3 plates per RBP tested) until 80% confluence, irradiated twice with 0.15 J/cm2 UV at 254 nm, harvested by scraping, and centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The cell pellets were subsequently lysed in iCLIP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Igepal, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). To generate RNA fragments of optimal size and digest genomic DNA, we incubated 9 mg (at 1 mg/ml) of Jurkat T cell lysates with 1 μ/ml of RNase 1 and 2 μl of Turbo Turbo DNase (Invitrogen) in CLIP lysis buffer for 3 min at 37 °C with shaking at 150 g. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 21,000 × g, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of antibody conjugated to protein A/G Dynabeads for 3 h at 4 °C. We kept 150 μl of supernatant as an ‘input' control; this mixture was not subjected to IP and was directly purified by SDS‒PAGE. The RNA:RBP complexes were purified by SDS‒PAGE and excised from the membrane as described above (miCLIP-Day2), and the isolated RNA was digested into nucleosides, after which the m6A levels were quantified by LC‒MS/MS82. In brief, we digested the purified RNA into ribonucleosides using one unit of nuclease P1 in 25 μl of 25 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM ZnCl2 and 10 mM NaCH3COO (pH 5.3) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, NH4HCO3 (100 mM) and 5 units of alkaline phosphatase were added, and the sample was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Formic acid was added at 0.1% v/v in a final volume of 50 μl, the samples were filtered (0.22 μm, Millipore), and 15–20 μl was analysed in duplicate by LC–MS/MS. The ribonucleosides were separated using a C18 reversed-phase column (100 × 2.1 mm, 3 μm particle size; Chromex Scientific) and detected by a TSQ Quantiva Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ Quantiva, Thermo Scientific) operating in positive ionisation mode with a capillary voltage of 3500 V, a sheath gas flow rate of 7.35 l/min, and a gas temperature of 325 °C. The retention time, mass transitions (m/z) and collision energies were ~4.1 min, 268.1 - > 136.1 m/z and 20 V, respectively, for adenosine and ~ 8.7 min, 282.1 - > 150.1 m/z, and 20 V, respectively, for m6A. A mixture of ribonucleoside standards of each ribonucleoside was run for absolute quantification. The data were recorded using Xcalibur 4.0.27 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the areas under the adenosine and m6A peaks were determined using Skyline.

RRACH, ARE, and TNFα pulldowns were performed with dimethyl labelling65,83. All buffer solutions were prepared with RNase-free reagents. For each RNA pulldown experiment, four individual pulldowns were performed. For each individual pulldown, 20 µl of streptavidin Sepharose high-performance slurry beads (Cytiva, 50% v/v) was used. The beads were washed with RNA-binding buffer (RBB, 50 mM HEPES-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40 (v/v), and 10 mM MgCl2) and centrifuged. All pulldown centrifugation steps were performed at 1,500 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The beads were then incubated with the RNase inhibitor RNasin plus (Promega) in RNA binding buffer (100 µl of RBB with 0.8 units of RNasin/µl) for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation, the beads were pre-blocked with yeast tRNA (Invitrogen, 100 μg tRNA in 1 ml RBB) for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotation wheel, followed by one wash with RBB. Then, the beads were incubated with either a control or m6A probe at a final concentration of 0.67 μM in 600 µl of RBB for 30 min at 4 °C while rotating. The probe sequences used for the RNA pulldowns can be found in the “Key Resources Table” (oligonucleotides). After probe incubation, the beads were washed once with RBB and twice with protein incubation buffer (PIB, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche)). The beads containing the immobilised RNA probes were then incubated with 1 mg of whole-cell lysate pooled from 9 donors in 600 µl of PIB supplemented with 0.4 units of RNasin/µl and 30 μg of tRNA for 30 min at RT, followed by 90 min at 4 °C. Unbound and unspecific proteins were removed by washing three times with PIB followed by two 1 x PBS washes. The remaining liquid was removed with a syringe. For on-bead digestion, 50 µl of elution buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 8.5; 2 M urea; and 10 mM DTT) was added to the beads, which were subsequently incubated for 20 min at RT in a thermoshaker at 200 g. To prevent the reformation of disulphide bonds, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 50 mM, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min in the dark at RT (200 × g). This was followed by partial digestion of proteins from the beads by the addition of 250 ng of trypsin and incubation for 2 h at RT at 200 g. in the dark. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing the cleaved peptides was collected, and the remaining peptides were collected by adding 50 µl of new elution buffer to the beads and incubating them for 5 min at 200 g before the supernatant was added to the previously collected supernatant. Next, 100 ng of trypsin was added to the eluates, and the proteins were further digested overnight at RT. The eluted peptide samples were then prepared and desalted for mass spectrometry analysis via the C18 StageTip method84. StageTips were prepared by placing a double C18 plug in a 200 µl pipette tip free of polymers. The disk was then washed with 50 µl of methanol, 50 µl of buffer B (0.1% formic acid, 80% acetonitrile), and two washes of 50 µl of buffer A (0.1% formic acid). All washes were performed by centrifugation at 1500 × g, after which the StageTips were placed in adaptors suitable for centrifugation and collection of the flowthrough. The eluted peptides were then loaded on the StageTips and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to allow the peptides to bind to the disk and the liquid to flow through. Peptides were then labelled by either light or medium (0.2% CH2O or 0.2% CD2O in 10 mM NaH2PO4, 35 mM Na2HPO4 and 32 mM NaBH3CN) dimethyl isotopes by labelling with 150 µl of the isotope labelling buffer and centrifugation of 1000 × g for 5 min twice83.

After peptide elution from the StageTips, individual peptide samples were combined, resulting in forward and reverse reactions, which served as two technical replicates: the forward reaction included the control probe CH2O (light) combined with the m6A probe CD2O (medium); the reverse reaction included the control probe CD2O (medium) combined with the m6A probe CH2O (light). Elution of both the forward and the reverse reactions was performed using 30 µl of buffer B (0.1% formic acid, 80% acetonitrile), followed by an additional elution using 10 µl. After speedvac centrifugation to reduce the sample to 5 µl, 7 µl of buffer A (0.1% formic acid) was added. For the measurements, 5 µl of each sample was loaded on an Easy-nLC1000 connected online to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the data were acquired in a 60 min gradient. A 43 min acetonitrile gradient (12% to 30%) was used, followed by washes at 60% and 95% for a total of 60 min of data acquisition. The spray voltage was set to 2100 V in positive ion mode. The scans were collected in a data-dependent mode and collected in the top 20 data-dependent acquisition modes. The dynamic exclusion was enabled and set to 45 s. The Orbitrap resolution for a full scan was set to 120,000 in a scan range of 350–1300 m/z.

The RNA pulldown results were processed using MaxQuant 1.6.6.085. The DimethylLys0 and DimethylNter0 labels were selected, as were DimethylLys4 and DimethylNter4 (light and medium, respectively). Peptide identifications were restricted to tryptic peptides with no more than two missed cleavages. The minimal peptide length was set at 7. Carbamidomethyl cysteine was set as a fixed modification, and oxidised methionine and protein N-acetylation were searched as variable modifications. Database searching was performed with a main-search precursor mass tolerance of 4.5 ppm and a fragment ion mass tolerance of 20 ppm. FDR was controlled at 1% at the peptide-spectrum match (PSM) and protein levels. The re-quantification function was enabled, and the UniProt human FASTA database from June 2017 was used as a search database. Perseus v1.6.15.086 was used to filter and analyze the data. Proteins identified as identified only by site, reverse and potential contaminants were removed. Finally, proteins were filtered if at least two peptides were identified with at least one unique peptide. To identify and visualise significant interactors, forward and reverse ratios were log2 and -log2 transformed, respectively, and a ratio of both forward and reverse of 1 was used as a cutoff. Scatter plots were generated in R.

The results are shown as the mean ± SEM or mean ± SD as stated in the figure legends. Statistical analysis was performed using R or Prism-10 software (GraphPad). p < 0.05 indicated statistical significance, and the statistical tests applied are stated in the figure legends.

Nature Reviews Biodiversity

                         (2026)Cite this article


Sharks and rays are sentinels of the state of the ocean. Since the mid-twentieth century, overall abundance has declined by nearly 65% and over one-third (37.5%) of species are threatened, causing widespread changes in community structure. This crisis stems from unregulated fisheries expansion coupled with inadequate catch-and-trade monitoring that fail to account for the complexity of shark and ray products, their use and global trade flows. In this Review, we assess the state of shark and ray populations worldwide, remedies to reverse their decline, and challenges and barriers to conservation. Stark geographic and taxonomic biases persist in essential data, requiring integrated species distribution modelling, data mobilization, trait prediction and new threat maps of fishing mortality. Addressing management gaps requires regulatory and market-based approaches that must ultimately reduce fishing mortality, link international frameworks to national fisheries management tools, and implement a mitigation hierarchy of management actions through sound compliance management across supply, trade and demand chains. Case studies reveal strengths and weaknesses in management effectiveness and demonstrate successful recoveries for wide-ranging and restricted-range species. Finally, we identify 6 key challenges and propose 25 research questions and actionable recommendations to bend back the curve of shark and ray biodiversity loss.

Financial details of the deal are confidential, but Hume AI says the company will continue to supply its technology to other frontier AI labs.

The deal is the latest sign that AI companies expect voice mode to become an increasingly important interface for interacting with customers—and that understanding a user's emotions and mood based on their voice interactions is key.

Hume AI expects to bring in $100 million in revenue in 2026 as it works with AI labs on tuning AI models to be more capable and useful voice helpers, says John Beadle, cofounder and managing partner of AEGIS Ventures, which invested in Hume AI. So far, the company has raised $74 million in funding.

CEO Alan Cowen, who has a PhD in psychology, will join Google DeepMind along with roughly seven other engineers. Cowen and the other Hume AI recruits will help Google DeepMind integrate voice and emotional intelligence into its latest models, according to sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they aren't authorized to speak publicly about the deal.

Hume AI has invested millions in developing models and tools to hone realistic voice interfaces and to detect emotions in the voices of users. The company trains its models by having experts annotate emotional cues in real conversations. At Google, Cowen and his colleagues will help the tech giant integrate voice and emotion technology into its frontier models, sources say.

“Voice is going to become a primary interface for AI, that is absolutely where it's headed,” says Andrew Ettinger, an experienced investor and executive who is taking over as the CEO of Hume AI. Ettinger says the company will be releasing its latest models in the coming months.

Beadle, of AEGIS Ventures, says AI models that can detect a user's emotions and adapt accordingly will become increasingly valuable, not only for consumer devices but also in customer support. “On the intelligence side, AI models are quite good at this point, but from the dimension of general helpfulness—do they understand your emotion and can they respond in a way that enables you to achieve whatever goal you're driving towards—we think there's a huge amount of opportunity for improvement,” Beadle says.

The Hume AI deal could position Google to compete even more aggressively with OpenAI's ChatGPT, which already features a lifelike voice mode. Google also recently partnered with Apple as part of a multiyear agreement that will see Google Gemini power a new version of Siri.

The Hume AI deal is the latest arrangement that blurs the line between a partnership and a conventional acquisition. Such arrangements allow big tech companies to extract high-value talent without the government oversight that comes with a traditional acquisition—though the Federal Trade Commission recently said it will begin scrutinizing so-called “aqui-hires.”

In 2024, Google DeepMind reportedly paid $3 billion to license technology from Character.ai, a company working on lifelike chatbot companions. Similar deals have seen Microsoft hire top talent from Inflection; Amazon recruit the team behind Adept; and Meta snag the CEO of Scale AI.

Imagine you were Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping and you woke up a year ago having magically been given command of puppet strings that control the White House. Your explicit geopolitical goal is to undermine trust in the United States on the world stage. You want to destroy the Western rules-based order that has preserved peace and security for 80 years, which allowed the US to triumph as an economic superpower and beacon of hope and innovation for the world. What exactly would you do differently with your marionette other than enact the ever more reckless agenda that Donald Trump has pursued since he became president last year?

Nothing.

In fact, the split-screen juxtaposition of three events this week—Trump's own nearly two-hour commemoration of his one-year anniversary as president; the gathering of defiant, rattled global elites in snowy Davos; and the spectacle of Denmark and its European allies building up a military force in Greenland with the express purpose of deterring a US military takeover—might someday be seen as heralding the official end of the grand experiment in a rules-based international order that has kept watch since World War II.

In the first three weeks of 2026, Trump's Mad King rantings about Greenland have accelerated into something far more stunning and alarming: A superpower is choosing to self-immolate and torch its remaining global trust and friendships, including and especially NATO, the most potent geopolitical alliance in world history, at the precise moment when it had been reinvigorated and renewed and at its strongest and largest ever in the wake of Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Trump's interest in Greenland is as inexplicable and personal as ever a presidential side quest was. Seeking control from the Danes of a territory holding just 57,000 people and land mostly covered by mile-thick ice is not some long-held conservative shibboleth; it's not something long lectured about in international-relations classrooms or even the fringiest of far-right media; it's not a territorial acquisition that Wall Street has clamored for and coveted over decades; there's no well-funded astroturf “Build Green in Greenland” lobbying campaign by shadowy business interests working the halls of Capitol Hall, and there's no rebel freedom and independence movement indigenous to Greenland that's whispering at cocktail parties in DC desperate for US aid; nor even, like so much of America's onetime Manifest Destiny era, is it a territory that large numbers of American settlers are desperate to homestead. None of that—quite the opposite.

In fact, given the very strength of the United States on the world stage and its network of alliances like NATO, effectively everyone in the United States who had any desires about Greenland at all could act upon them already. The US already has a military base there—and, in fact, once had far more military bases there and has chosen to wind them down over the years. Sure, it may have some valuable rare earths and its access routes to the melting Arctic might help trade move more easily in the future, but even all of that would have been accessible to any of the dreamy plutocrats who hoped to access its riches given that Denmark was, until just hours ago, among our nation's closest and most reliable allies. Just about anyone who ever wanted to move to Greenland has already done so.

Annexing Greenland is as unpopular with Americans as almost anything ever polled—just 17 percent of Americans support Trump's push, and an astounding 4 percent think it's a good idea for America to take Greenland by military force. To put that in context: According to a 2022 survey, about 13 percent of Americans believe in Bigfoot.

Nor is Donald Trump's new-found imperial ambition coming at some rambunctious peak of popular and political support. His approval rating has fallen steadily since returning to office. He is underwater dramatically in support for his signature immigration efforts. News headlines are filled with how he appeared, for a time, to be incredibly close friends with the world's most notorious pedophile. Democrats are winning and picking up seats and offices with dramatic vote percentages. And the Republican majority in the House hinges on such a narrow margin now that Speaker Mike Johnson's control of the chamber relies on the vagaries of such things as car accidents in Indiana. Nor has Trump rallied the nation to some grand patriotic cause; in fact, he can barely articulate whatever vision he's pursuing—Wednesday in Davos, he referred to “Iceland” multiple times when he meant “Greenland.” Hours later, he announced he'd come to “the framework of a future deal” with the secretary-general of NATO regarding Greenland and the Arctic, but even if such a deal emerges in the future, the damage is done and the path of the world's future has been rewritten.

Occupying and annexing Greenland is Trump's mind working in its weirdest and most unhinged ways. He admitted as such in a troubling and rambling New York Times interview early in the month. Asked about “why Greenland?” he said, “Because that's what I feel is psychologically needed for success.” It is Donald Trump fully embracing as president the worldview he most succinctly expressed in his infamous Access Hollywood tape: “When you're a star, they let you do it.” And indeed nothing he has experienced in a decade on the world stage has disavowed him of that belief, as he has repeatedly beaten and outfoxed the system and become the first convicted felon elected to the White House.

To watch the push for Greenland is to experience one of the wildest things that any country or head of state has done in the entire history of the modern world, dating back to the very creation of the nation-state era in 1648 with the Treaty of Westphalia. It is hard, in fact, to find any geopolitical parallel. Countries and leaders have certainly made choices and mistakes that ended in ruin—there's Napoleon setting out to invade Russia or the actions of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the start of World War I—but it's impossible to think of a single moment when a country so thoroughly set about consciously dismantling its core sources of national strength and influence.

For the 80 years since the end of World War II, the US model of innovation, trade, and economic hegemony has been built on a foundation of six seemingly inviolable traditions and policies held steady across both Republican and Democratic administrations: (1) easy access of immigrants to the US, particularly its unparalleled world-class schools and universities; (2) rich and steady government support of higher education, medical research, and laboratories; (3) broad and ever-more-frictionless trade access to US markets and, reciprocally, a flow of US products to the rest of the world; (4) a firm, unyielding, and unquestionable adherence to the rule of law at home that made the US a predictable and safe place to create, build, and do business at home; and (5) a similarly firm, unyielding, and unquestionable network of geopolitical alliances abroad that knitted together a security blanket that stretched around the entire globe, backed up by the most powerful and widest-ranging military ever seen in human history.

All five of those pillars helped firm up and underpin another equally critical pillar: (6) a politically independent and fiscally prudent monetary policy that established the US dollar as the world's safest reserve currency. This made US Treasury bonds the savings bank for the entire world—for democracies and authoritarian regimes alike!—and made US banking networks and capital markets the place to be for any company looking for access to investors.

Surely presidents tinkered at the margins of this recipe—cutting here, investing there—and sometimes even fundamentally altered it, as Richard Nixon did when he took the US off the gold standard in 1971 and rewrote the era of the Bretton Woods economic model created in the wake of World War II. But even then, Nixon understood how the pillars reinforced one another and pointed the way to a future still led calmly and steadily by the United States. And, yes, surely due to a combination of missteps, from the disastrous imperialist adventures in Iraq to the 2008 financial collapse to miscalculating the rise of China, US power had already ebbed from its moral standing and unipolarity that it held at 8:46 am on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. But a quarter century after that peak, day-in and day-out, the US still served as the anchor and foundation of world peace, power, and global institutions. (It's worth noting, too, that after those 9/11 attacks, NATO rallied to America's side, invoking its “Article 5” protections for the first and only time in its history, and Denmark was such a staunch partner that the tiny Nordic country suffered the third-highest per capita death toll fighting alongside the US in Afghanistan and Iraq.)

It is impossible to overstate the gift of security, wealth, opportunity, and sheer innovation that these six foundational pillars of the US policy achieved for both the world beyond and Americans at home. To be clear, America's eight-decade reign atop the world order was hardly without great human cost—felt most acutely by those on the far edges of the Cold War, from Vietnam and Cambodia to Africa and Latin America. But scratch at almost any titanic achievement of humanity across the last 80 years in human history and you'll see the traces of America's six foundational policies, from the astounding achievements in human health and well-being to the decline of world poverty to the very invention of the internet. Pick almost any measure of business success and I can show you how that six-part recipe applied. To choose just one: All four of the world's $4 trillion companies—Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Apple—saw immigrants or their children play a key role in their success.

And yet systematically over the last year—in ways that Putin or Xi couldn't have dreamed we would do to ourselves—Donald Trump has undermined all six pillars. In recent weeks specifically, he has done lasting and irreparable damage to the rule of law, global alliances, and the independence of US monetary policy.

Just in the first three weeks of this year, we've seen estimates that US legal immigration will fall by as much as half; warnings that PhD programs are facing collapse after the administration's year-long assault on science, higher education, and research; Europe and our closest trading partners readying billions in new tariffs on US trade; masked federal law enforcement, with all the hallmarks of a fascist secret police, occupying a major American city as the president launches probes of local and state political leaders who oppose him; and the chairman of the Federal Reserve hard-launching a dire warning about presidential pressure on the country's monetary policy.

But it's the international friendships where one can most clearly see the costs mounting in real time. Just look at the statements coming from that mountain redoubt of global capitalism at Davos: Canadian prime minister Mark Carney—the leader of our closest ally and largest trading partner, whose military is now modeling doing battle with the US across what has long been the world's longest unguarded border—got a standing ovation for a speech in which he proclaimed, “Let me be clear: We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.” Or take European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who essentially called for independence from the United States.

This is the end of the world as we have known it for 80 years—all for reasons that will confound future political scientists and historians. There is no strategy behind this exercise in superpower suicide other than the president's own narcissism, greed, and his general frustration at never being respected by the elites whose favor he desires more than anything.

At one level, Trump's January rampage highlights the collective failure of every institution, safeguard, check, and balance that the United States thought it had in place to limit executive power gone berserk. But chief among these institutional collapses is the sheer cowardice of that narrow Republican Congress, which has failed the founders' fundamental belief and trust that the legislative branch would protect its own powers and authorities from the executive branch and would act first to follow their oath of office to the Constitution and not as members of a president's own party.

Putin and Xi must be astounded at their good fortune; in Davos, China is already pitching itself to Europe and the world beyond to help pick up the pieces of the American century. Putin, who has watched a generation's blood and treasure ground up in the mud of Ukraine, is getting a reprieve at a moment when he least deserves it. He has spent his own quarter century in office saying that the “democratic West” is just as corrupt as his own authoritarianism—and now, day after day, Donald Trump is furnishing him with plenty of fresh evidence.

Through much of his first presidential term, conspiracy theorists wondered and tweeted that Trump must be a Russian agent; in this second term, we've come to an even more horrifying conclusion—one more embarrassing for the American voter and more damning for Trump in history's final judgment: He's doing all this by his own volition.

Historian Barbara Tuchman once famously pointed to the May 1910 grand funeral of England's Edward VII—a fabulously colorful parade of mourning that brought together nine kings, seven queens, and 40 more imperial and royal highnesses—as the high point and last gasp of that grand era of wealth and geopolitical dominance that had been 19-th century Europe, before it destroyed itself in the First World War and ceded control of the world to that upstart America across the pond.

Someday, similarly, we will tell our children about the month of January 2026 in world politics, and they will not be able to fathom what we did to ourselves. Nor will they ever be able to contemplate what the United States once meant to the world beyond.

Last week, a website called ICE List went viral after its creators said that they had received what they described as a leak of personal information about nearly 4,500 Department of Homeland Security employees. However, a WIRED analysis of the site found that the database relies heavily on information that apparent DHS employees have posted publicly online themselves. This comes at a time when DHS has characterized reporting on or publicizing the identity of ICE officers as “doxing” and has threatened to prosecute perceived offenders to the fullest extent of the law.

ICE List operates as a crowdsourced wiki maintained by volunteers, who have discretion over who is added and what is marked as “verified.” Like Wikipedia, with which it has no affiliation, ICE List has category pages that feature a link to every page included in that category. Not everyone on the list is an ICE employee or even affiliated with a federal agency; former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, for example, whom DHS told the Associated Press is not an ICE agent, is included in the wiki's “Agents” category. On his actual page, his “Agency” is listed as “N/A” and his “Role” is listed as “Propagandist; Agitator.” (Tarrio posted on X that he wished he worked for ICE, but called the ICE List page disinformation.)

Dominick Skinner, the owner of ICE List, says he does not believe that what ICE List does is doxing. ICE List doesn't post the home addresses of identified agents, and says on its About page that “false submissions, harassment, or attempts to misuse the platform will be removed.”

“If this were doxing, then we dox ourselves by simply being present in online environments,” Skinner says, “which is just rather ridiculous.”

WIRED reviewed individuals' pages that were included in the “Agents” category on ICE List as of January 22. Of the 1,580 pages, nearly 90 percent mention LinkedIn as a source of information, though some of the links cited now appear to be broken, and not all of the links support claims made on the wiki. (Someone listed as “active” on ICE List may, for example, have a LinkedIn depicting them as a former legal advisor for ICE. On its About page, ICE List says that “errors may occur.”) Other linked profiles lack photos and don't appear to be very active. Some of the links, however, appear to match federal immigration agents who have previously been named in official ICE press releases and court records.

Like other LinkedIn users, those who self-identify as ICE deportation officers and other types of DHS employees are in many cases posting New Year's resolutions, reacting to meandering motivational posts about the meaning of leadership, and letting people know they're #opentowork.

The DHS did not respond to requests for comment.

Some individuals' pages on the ICE List wiki cite OpenPayrolls, a searchable database of public employees' salaries that includes some ICE employees, and SignalHire, a data broker that specializes in lead generation, as sources of information.

A spokesperson for OpenPayrolls wrote in an email that it has no affiliation with ICE List and that the ICE-related payroll records on its site were released by the US Office of Personnel Management in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The spokesperson also said, “To date, we have not received outreach from any government agency expressing concerns regarding the display of public records on our transparency website.”

SignalHire did not respond to a request for comment, but it also includes direct links to the LinkedIn profiles of people representing themselves as ICE officers on its website.

There's no fancy trick to finding ICE officers on LinkedIn. WIRED was able to surface hundreds of profiles belonging to people who say they are ICE employees by simply clicking the “Show more results” button on the “People” tab of ICE's LinkedIn page. LinkedIn did not respond to a request for comment.

In press releases, media interviews, and in court, Trump administration officials have said repeatedly that ICE agents and their families are at risk of being doxed. In October, a DHS press release said that ICE officers were “facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them and their families are being doxxed and threatened online.”

Last week, DHS secretary Kristi Noem admonished a CBS News journalist interviewing her for saying the name of Jonathan Ross, a deportation officer in ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations division who shot and killed Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good. Federal officials aided the identification of Ross, apparently inadvertently, by telling news outlets that the officer, who hadn't yet been identified, had been previously dragged by a car during an immigrant enforcement operation in June. (“DHS will never confirm or deny attempts to dox our law enforcement officers,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told WIRED earlier in January in response to questions about Ross. “Doxing our officers put their lives and their families in serious danger.”)

As part of their duties, ICE deportation officers are expected to support prosecutions or administrative actions by helping prepare investigative reports. Like other deportation officers, Ross has given court testimony and submitted declarations to support court cases, including the one linked to the incident during which he was dragged. Court filings that detail his appearances in court and his written declarations are a matter of public record.

Agents also have their own responsibilities when it comes to maintaining their online presence. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein has reported on US Border Patrol–branded documents that instruct employees, “Be mindful of what you post on social media.” CBP did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.

The federal government has used federal agents' purported fear of doxing as an argument for why they should be allowed to wear masks and other facial coverings, a practice the state of Minnesota has sought to suspend in its lawsuit against Noem in her capacity as secretary of DHS.

In a declaration filed in the Minnesota lawsuit, Kyle Harvick, a CBP official who oversees Border Patrol operations for El Centro Station in California, said that “the rise of doxing, the advancement of facial recognition technologies, and the proliferation of bad actors on social media has created an unprecedented operational risk for federal law enforcement officers that necessitates appropriate protective steps such as wearing masks in public to protect their identities.”

Even before winning reelection, President Donald Trump and his supporters put immigration at the center of their messaging. In addition to other conspiracy theories, the right-wing went all in on the false claim that immigrants were voting illegally in large numbers. The Trump administration has since poured billions of dollars into immigration enforcement, and in March, Trump issued an executive order requiring the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that states have “access to appropriate systems for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered.”

In May, DHS began encouraging states to check their voter rolls against immigration data with the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program, run by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). SAVE now has access to data from across the federal government, not just on immigrants but on citizens as well.

Experts have warned that using disparate sources of data—all collected for different purposes–could lead to errors, including identifying US citizens as noncitizens.

According to the plaintiffs in a new legal complaint, it appears that it's already happening.

The complaint, filed against DHS and the Social Security Administration (SSA) in the Washington, DC, District Court by the League of Women Voters and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), alleges that the new SAVE expansion has led to American citizens being kicked off state voter rolls and that the creation of what amounts to a national citizenship data bank is unconstitutional.

“Eligible US citizen voters will be wrongfully purged from voter rolls based on inaccurate data from the illegally overhauled SAVE system,” says Nikhel Sus, deputy chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which is counsel for the plaintiffs in the case. DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

SAVE was created in 1986 as a way for states to check whether immigrants applying for government services were eligible to receive them, and it did not have access to information on natural-born American citizens. But as the Trump administration has sought to crack down on immigration, DHS has radically expanded the tool.

Last April, WIRED reported that SAVE was querying data from the SSA, the Internal Revenue Service, and state voter data. On May 22, DHS announced a “partnership” with the SSA and rolled out SAVE as a tool that state and local governments could use for voter verification. The goal, according to USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser, was to “identify and stop aliens from hijacking our elections.” Twenty-two states, including Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, have agreements in place to use SAVE to verify voters' citizenship by bulk-uploading information from voter rolls and personal identification information, the suit alleges. But in doing so, the complaint argues, some of these states are already disenfranchising eligible voters.

In October, Texas secretary of state Jane Nelson announced that the state had identified 2,724 “potential noncitizens” who were registered to vote. One of those, Anthony Nel, is, in fact, a US citizen. According to the complaint, SAVE identified Nel as a noncitizen “based on outdated data, leading to his voter registration being wrongfully canceled in December 2025.” In response to a request for comment, Texas assistant secretary of state for communications Alicia Pierce referred WIRED to the October press release where the state announced the findings from its use of SAVE.

“We're talking about a known error rate that will result—and already has resulted—in multiple people being kicked off the voter rolls, going into a critical election,” says John Davisson, director of litigation and senior counsel at EPIC, which is one of the plaintiffs in the case.

States are not supposed to immediately purge someone flagged by SAVE from their rolls but are supposed to reach out to the voter to confirm their status. But if voters don't receive the notice or aren't able to respond in time, their registration is at risk of being canceled. “It's a burden that lawfully registered voters shouldn't have to bear,” says Davisson.

Research has shown that instances of noncitizens voting are extremely rare. Trump and his supporters have spent years spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories about the integrity of US elections, making it a focal point of the right-wing media ecosystem. “Just by identifying potential noncitizen voters through SAVE, regardless of whether they actually are noncitizens, this false narrative will be further fueled,” says Sus. “There is a broader concern about sowing distrust in the integrity of our election results.”

The complaint argues, “DHS and SSA lack any statutory or constitutional authority to transform SAVE into a national data bank to conduct citizenship checks for purposes of determining individuals' eligibility to vote in elections.” It argues that the inclusion of social security data not only introduced potential inaccuracies but effectively transformed SAVE into something else—a citizenship database.

A privacy threshold analysis (PTA) conducted by USCIS, which was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the plaintiffs and has been reviewed by WIRED, warns that USCIS knew that “shortfalls in data accuracy in the system could cause incomplete or false results,” even as DHS was encouraging states to use the tool. The PTA marked SAVE as “not in compliance” with privacy regulations, in part because it had not yet issued a system of records notice, the legal notice required to inform the public that social security data was being shared for immigration purposes.

The PTA, which was completed in July 2025, noted that inaccuracies in the new SAVE system could be due to a lack of electronic records, particularly from the SSA, which were “not reliably recorded pre-1981.” The PTA further notes that USCIS “is not the source agency for Social Security Administration–related information” and therefore “cannot verify accuracy” of SSA data.

“Voters are being wrongfully and illegally removed from the rolls on the basis of data that is known to be inaccurate,” says Davisson.

Leland Dudek, former acting commissioner of the SSA, says the PTA accurately reflects potential issues with social security data being used in SAVE. “Social Security numbers were never intended for this use case,” says Dudek. “The records of Social Security are for the discreet and explicit purposes of old age survivors, disability insurance, and Social Security insurance.” Social Security numbers are issued to people legally allowed to work in the US and do not change once someone naturalizes. Immigration and naturalization processes are managed by DHS, and naturalized citizens are not required to tell SSA if they naturalize, meaning SSA data may be out of date. (In March 2025, SSA suspended a program that automatically mailed Social Security cards to newly naturalized citizens and people authorized to work in the US, requiring instead that they physically appear at one of the agency's regional offices.).

Dudek says the new SAVE tool was likely not fit to be rolled out for voter identification. “It needed to be rolled out in a way that was thoughtful,” he says. “When you're targeting the most fundamental right of democracy, you have to give consideration and gather input.”

This use of social security data to create a kind of national citizenship verification system, Sus says, extends far beyond the authority of DHS. “Congress has provided no specific statutory authorization for the Department of Homeland Security to create a national citizenship data bank to look up any American's citizenship status,” Sus says. “DHS is effectively imposing a backdoor, federal documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement for voters whose citizenship SAVE can't confirm. Not only will this needlessly burden the voting rights of US citizens, but it undermines Congress' choice to not adopt a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement for voting.”

As the midterms inch closer, other government systems are being proposed to further tamp down on voting access. Congress is considering a SAVE Act that would require proof of citizenship to vote. Billionaire Elon Musk has publicly supported ending the congressional filibuster to pass an “election integrity” law. Earlier this week, a different court filing indicated that a member of the Department of Government Efficiency team at the SSA had signed a “Voter Data Agreement” with a political advocacy organization seeking to “find evidence of voter fraud and to overturn election results in certain states.”

The hurdles from the SAVE program, meanwhile, are more than enough to keep voting advocates concerned. Sus worries that the SAVE program could introduce further barriers to voting in the run-up to the 2026 midterm elections. “In Texas, there are primary elections coming up in March,” he says. “If a voter's registration is canceled close to that election, and they don't have time to get together the documentary proof of citizenship that is required to reinstate their registration, then they may lose the right to vote.”

Most CISOs believe they have a reasonable grasp of their organization's no-code footprint. They know employees are building small automations to streamline tasks. They assume a few dozen or a few hundred workflows are running quietly across the business. But when security teams finally gain real visibility, a different reality emerges.

One global enterprise expected to find a couple of hundred business-user workflows. The actual number was over 3,000. Another discovered that a single finance employee, someone with no engineering background, had created more than 150 automations. Still another found a workflow silently forwarding an employee's corporate email to a personal Gmail account. None of these were logged, inspected for security risks, or monitored.

These aren't anecdotes; they are symptoms of a structural shift. Enterprises are now increasingly exposed to a shadow infrastructure that is unseen, unmanaged, and unprotected.

Traditional AppSec programs are optimized for code stored in repositories, pushed through pipelines, and deployed through CI/CD, not for no-code apps, connectors, and automations created on platforms like Power Platform, ServiceNow, Salesforce, and UiPath.

Meanwhile, most organizations assume business-user automations are simple, low-risk, and limited in scope. The reality is more complex. Citizen developers now outnumber traditional software developers by an order of magnitude. Plus, they are wiring together data sources, triggering multi-system workflows, and calling APIs, not just building basic macros or departmental utilities.

Because these automations are created outside engineering governance, traditional monitoring tools never see them. They do not pass through security code reviews, undergo threat modeling, or generate the types of logs that SIEMs expect. Yet they perform actions that directly impact production data and business processes.

This blind spot often results in credentials embedded directly into workflows. It can also create SQL and OData exposure in tools like Microsoft Power BI, automations that bridge environments meant to remain isolated, and sensitive data exposed externally. In the worst cases, AI agents may gain access to entire database tables because a default configuration option was never changed.

None of these security risks represents malicious intent. They are the inevitable consequence of a system optimized for convenience rather than oversight.

Once security sees the scale of no-code development, a deeper problem emerges: ownership.

Many no-code workflows are tied to generic service accounts, each with hundreds of automations. Others belong to former employees. Ownership gaps persist because business units build independently, IT provisions access without governing logic or data flows, and security only has visibility into assets that touch their tooling.

AI agents amplify this issue. When employees can describe a goal in natural language, “summarize transactions,” “route exceptions,” “pull customer records,” and the platform automatically generates the workflow, authorship becomes abstract. An AI-generated workflow may be iterated on without clear ownership over time. The question “Who owns this?” becomes materially harder to answer.

These ownership gaps make incident response nearly impossible. If a workflow begins exfiltrating data, or a connector suddenly escalates its privileges, security teams don't know who understands the logic, who made the design choices, or whether the behavior is expected. The only recourse is to disable workflows wholesale, disrupting critical processes along the way.

Once they recognize this problem, most organizations reach for familiar AppSec tools, SAST, DAST, IAST, penetration testing, and policy reviews. These approaches often break down because no-code automations rarely produce code that scanners can parse or run in environments scanners can safely execute against:

Even identity governance systems struggle, since workflows often run under long-lived service identities that no human can be tied to.

What emerges is a shadow layer of business logic that sits entirely outside the boundaries of traditional AppSec, DevSecOps, and identity programs. As long as ownership remains fragmented and discovery elusive, security debt continues to grow unchecked.

No-code development isn't going away; in fact, AI-assisted workflow generation is only accelerating it. Clamping down on citizen development will only stifle innovation and is not a viable option. A better approach is to gain visibility and establish governance where none currently exists. Here is a five-step process to consider:

We're entering an era where the most dangerous vulnerabilities aren't in the code AppDev teams write, but in the thousands of workflows and automations business users build on their own. The sooner organizations recognize and confront the invisible no-code estate, the faster they can reduce the security debt accumulating inside their infrastructure.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Jeff Clarke's Mission to Save Dell PCs","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/jeff-clarkes-mission-to-save-dell-pcs-180102.html","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:44:43 GMT","

For years, the technology world has watched with a mix of curiosity and concern as Dell Technologies, once the undisputed titan of the PC market, seemed to drift further away from the hardware excellence that defined it.

The recent news that Jeff Clarke, Dell's vice chairman and chief operating officer, is taking the reins of the PC business to engineer a massive turnaround is both a recognition of the company's current crisis and a sign of hope.

As we enter 2026, Clarke is not just inheriting a division; he is attempting to revive a brand that has spent the last several years suffocating under its own bureaucratic weight and strategic missteps.

Let's talk about Dell's slide, Clarke's challenge, and the path back. Then we'll close with my product of the week, a nearly invisible PC from HP.

To understand why Jeff Clarke's new role is so critical, one must first look at how Dell lost its way. The rot began with the incredible distraction of the EMC merger, a Herculean task that shifted the company's focus toward enterprise data centers and cloud infrastructure.

While that move was financially successful in the long run, it left the PC division — the heart of Dell's identity — starved for the creative oxygen it needed to compete with a revitalized HP and an increasingly innovative Lenovo.

Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of Dell's decline was its unwillingness to take reasonable risks. Dell spent years teasing the market with Project Luna, a visionary, sustainable, and modular PC concept that could have revolutionized the industry by making hardware as easy to repair and upgrade as building a Lego set.

Instead of bringing Luna to market as a flagship differentiator, Dell kept it in concept purgatory while competitors moved forward with their own sustainability initiatives.



Dell's Project Luna concept highlighted modular design and repairability — but never became a flagship product. (AI-generated image)

The biggest blow to the brand's prestige came in 2025 with the elimination of the premium XPS line. In a baffling attempt to simplify branding, Dell killed off one of the most respected names in computing and replaced it with a generic “Pro/Plus/Premium” naming convention. This move didn't just confuse customers; it signaled that Dell no longer believed in the “halo” product that defined its engineering prowess.

Critics and insiders have pointed to a leadership vacuum at the top as a primary driver of this stagnation. Michael Dell, the company's legendary founder, has increasingly appeared to have “retired in place.” While he remains the face of the company, his attention has seemed focused more on the financial engineering of the broader Dell Technologies portfolio and philanthropic efforts rather than the day-to-day grit of making great PCs.

Without the founder's obsessive drive for hardware perfection, the PC division became a culture of “covering up” issues rather than identifying and addressing them. Instead of fixing thermal problems or stagnant designs, the company focused on marketing pivots and rebranding exercises that obscured the underlying hardware fatigue.

Adding fuel to the fire, Dell's decline was exacerbated by industry-wide headwinds that the company was uniquely ill-equipped to handle.

The rollout of Windows 11 has been widely regarded as a disappointment, with adoption rates lagging roughly 10-12 points behind those of Windows 10 at the same stage of its lifecycle. Microsoft's aggressive push into the AI PC era has only complicated matters.

As Clarke himself admitted at CES 2026, consumers are not buying laptops for the sake of an NPU (neural processing unit) or a Copilot key. They are buying them for build quality, battery life, and performance.

Dell leaned too heavily into the AI hype, neglecting the core hardware fundamentals that buyers actually care about. With social media backlashes against “Microslop” and AI-bloat growing, Dell found itself tied to a sinking software narrative while its hardware brand was already in retreat.

If anyone can pull Dell back from the brink, it is Jeff Clarke. A 30-year veteran of the company, Clarke is known for his operational discipline and a no-nonsense approach to engineering. He is the architect of the “One Dell Way” initiative, a sweeping company-wide overhaul designed to break down silos and standardize processes.

Clarke's background in product development and supply chain management makes him uniquely qualified to fix the “cover-up” culture. He understands that a laptop isn't just a commodity to be marketed; it's an integrated piece of engineering that requires transparency and continuous refinement.

His recent decision to revive the XPS brand at CES 2026 is the first significant step toward acknowledging past mistakes and refocusing on what made Dell great: premium, recognizable, high-quality hardware.

To truly turn the ship around, Clarke must address two looming threats.

First is the massive security gap. HP has dominated the enterprise conversation with HP Wolf Security, a deep, hardware-level isolation technology that has become the gold standard for the “work-from-anywhere” era. Dell has nothing that matches the comprehensive nature of the Wolf Security suite. For Clarke to win back the C-suite, he must invest heavily in a security architecture that goes beyond standard BIOS protection and offers true, isolated resilience against modern threats.

Second, Dell must look at the changing landscape of personal computing. At CES 2026, Lenovo stole the show with the launch of Qira, an ambient intelligence that lives across PCs and smartphones. Lenovo's ability to offer a “single intelligence” across multiple devices — powered by its success in the Motorola smartphone business — highlights a glaring gap in Dell's portfolio.

While Dell famously exited the smartphone market years ago, the rise of agentic AI that follows a user from their desk to their pocket might force a reconsideration. If a PC is no longer an island but part of a personal AI ecosystem, Dell's lack of a mobile presence could become a fatal flaw in the long-term competition against Lenovo and Apple.

Jeff Clarke's takeover of the Dell PC business is a high-stakes gamble for a company that has spent too long resting on its laurels. By recommitting to the XPS name, admitting that AI isn't a magic bullet for sales, and initiating the “One Dell Way” overhaul, Clarke is signaling a return to hardware sanity.

However, the path ahead remains treacherous. Clarke must overcome a decade of “retirement in place” at the executive level and successfully challenge Lenovo's breadth in personal technology and its Qira AI effort while offsetting HP's security dominance.

While the XPS revival is a victory for fans, the ultimate success of this turnaround will depend on whether Clarke can move Dell from being a follower of Microsoft's software whims to an innovator in hardware-led security and cross-device intelligence. If he succeeds, 2026 will be remembered as the year Dell found its soul again. If he fails, the company may find that rebranding can only hide a lack of vision for so long.



For quite some time, I've argued that the traditional desktop tower is a dinosaur waiting for the asteroid. We've seen the “NUC” movement and the rise of high-power notebooks, but at CES this year, HP finally delivered the missing link I've been looking for: The HP EliteBoard G1a.



HP's EliteBoard G1a puts a full Copilot+ PC inside a premium keyboard chassis.

With the PC built into the keyboard chassis, the EliteBoard collapses the traditional desktop footprint. While this form factor might remind some of the Commodore 64 or the Atari 400, the technology inside is purely 2026. HP even built dual mics and speakers into the keyboard body, reinforcing the idea that the PC should disappear into the workspace.

We are entering the era of agentic AI, where our PCs aren't just tools but digital partners. To do that effectively, you need local processing power that doesn't sound like a jet engine taking off on your desk. The G1a is powered by the AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series PRO processors, delivering up to 55 TOPS of NPU performance via the AMD XDNA 2 architecture. This configuration enables it to run complex LLMs and AI agents locally and silently — critical for those of us who value a quiet, focused workspace.

Coming off the HP Security Summit in December, I was particularly impressed by the integration of HP Wolf Security for Business. The G1a features quantum-resistant firmware protection, which is becoming a baseline requirement as we see more sophisticated AI-driven cyber threats targeting identity and session tokens.

Furthermore, HP has finally fixed the “disposable tech” problem. The EliteBoard is remarkably serviceable for its size. You can remove the bottom cover to replace the RAM, SSD, or even the cooling fans in minutes. In an industry that often favors glue over screws, this level of sustainability — combined with its EPEAT Gold registration — is refreshing.



The HP EliteBoard G1a isn't just a PC; it's a statement about the future of work. At just 12 mm thick and weighing 750g, it's compact, powerful, and built to eliminate the clutter that has defined the desktop experience for decades — making the PC nearly invisible.

HP plans to have the EliteBoard G1a available on HP.com in March, with pricing to follow closer to release. For anyone who wants a clean desk environment without sacrificing the power to run the latest AI models locally, the HP EliteBoard G1a is easily my Product of the Week.

Bicycles for the mind. … Information at your fingertips. … Managers of infinite minds?

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella riffed on some famous lines from tech leaders past this week in an appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and offered up his own trippy candidate to join the canon of computing metaphors. 

Nadella traced the lineage in a conversation with former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. 

And now? “All of us are going to be managers of infinite minds,” Nadella said. “And so if we have that as the theory, then the question is, what can we do with it?”

He was referring to AI agents — the autonomous software that can take on tasks, work through problems, and keep going while you sleep. Microsoft and others have been talking for the better part of a year now about people starting to oversee large fleets of them. 

Nadella said it's already reshaping how teams are structured. At Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, the company has merged design, program management, product management, and front-end engineering into a single new role: full-stack builders. Overall, he called it the biggest structural change to software teams he's seen in a career that started at Microsoft in the 1990s.

“The jobs of the future are here,” Nadella said, putting his own spin on a famous line often attributed to sci-fi writer William Gibson. “They're just not evenly distributed.”

Nadella's comments came during a live stream for LinkedIn Premium members, hosted from Davos by LinkedIn VP and Editor in Chief Daniel Roth, after Sunak mentioned his two teenage daughters, and the world they'll enter. Young people may not manage lots of people at age 20 or 21, he said, “but they will be managing a team of agents.” 

Sunak was referencing an essay by Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti in Time. 

The agentic shift, Argenti wrote, requires “moving from being a sole performer to an orchestra conductor” — your team now includes AI agents that “must be guided and supervised with the same approach you would apply to a new, junior colleague.”

Nadella agreed, saying “we do need a new theory of the mind” to navigate what's coming, before he offered up his new metaphor about managing infinite minds.

In other remarks at Davos, Nadella made headlines with his warning that AI's massive energy demands risk eroding its “social permission” unless it delivers tangible benefits in health, education, and productivity. Energy costs, he added, will decide the AI race's winners, with GDP growth tied to cheap power for processing AI tokens.

Whether “infinite minds” catches on like “bicycles” and “fingertips” remains to be seen. But it's definitely more psychedelic. And if this shift is stranger than what came before, maybe we do need a mind-expanding metaphor to make sense of it all.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

Less than a year after layoffs and a public plea by its CEO for new investments, General Fusion on Thursday announced a $1 billion SPAC agreement to take the fusion energy company public. 

Vancouver, B.C.-based General Fusion plans to merge with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. III in a transaction that could close by the middle of this year, making it one of the first fusion companies to go public. General Fusion expects to be listed on the Nasdaq and trade under the ticker GFUZ.   

“We are completely focused on the future,” Megan Wilson, chief strategy officer for General Fusion, told GeekWire. “The path of any innovative company is not always linear.”

General Fusion is part of the race to produce abundant, clean energy by smashing together light atoms — replicating the reactions that power the sun and stars. The pursuit has become increasingly urgent as artificial intelligence and increased electrification of the economy drives up demand for climate friendly power. 

Wilson said they explored various funding options, including a traditional IPO, but appreciated Spring Valley's experience and track record in creating publicly traded companies. Spring Valley previously used a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) to bring NuScale Power, a fission startup, public in 2021.

The deal with General Fusion includes $230 million from the SPAC's trust, presuming no redemptions, as well as a $100 million private investment in public equity, or PIPE.

The 115-person company previously raised a total of $400 million from investors, industry partners and government grants. 

General Fusion's merger news comes a month after fusion rival TAE Technologies announced its own agreement to go public. 

“It's really great to have competition in the market, and we think that that transaction is just another signal that the public markets are ready for fusion,” Wilson said. 

California-based TAE has a $6 billion planned merger with Trump Media & Technology Group, the publicly traded parent company of the social media platform Truth Social. With the merger and new funding, TAE said that it's aiming to site and begin building a utility-scale fusion plant this year.

Despite the massive investments flowing into the sector, none of the companies have demonstrated the ability to produce excess energy from fusion reactions. But they're all reporting progress toward that goal, with TAE and Washington's Helion Energy working on commercial facilities. 

General Fusion, which launched in 2002, is currently operating its Lawson Machine 26, a magnetized targeted fusion demonstration device that's about half the size of its planned commercial‑scale machine. 

The new financial support will fund initiatives to hit essential scientific milestones with the device by the middle of 2028. That includes reaching 100 million degrees Celsius — a target it had earlier set for last year — and achieving the conditions needed to create fusion reactions that produce excess energy.

General Fusion hopes to be able to deploy a commercial fusion machine by around 2035.

“This transaction with Spring Valley positions us with the capital we need to be able to continue operating the Lawson Machine 26 as we pursue really transformative technical milestones that will ultimately put us on a path to the first-of-a-kind plant,” Wilson said.

AIM Intelligent Machines (AIM), a Seattle-area startup developing software that lets bulldozers and excavators operate on their own, announced $4.9 million in new contracts with the U.S. Air Force to build and repair military bases and airfields.

Founded in 2021, AIM got its start in mining and construction, and is now expanding to defense applications. AIM's technology works with existing equipment and is designed for dangerous or hard-to-reach places, including areas where equipment might be dropped in by parachute. One person can remotely manage an entire site of working vehicles.

For airfield repairs, the company's tech can scan the area using sensors to create a 3D map of damage. Then autonomous machines clear debris and can repair the runway — all remotely and without people on the ground. Military advisors say the approach could speed up construction, reduce risk to personnel, and make it easier to deploy equipment in tough conditions.

Founded in 2021 and led by longtime engineers, AIM raised $50 million last year from investors including Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst, Human Capital. The company is led by CEO Adam Sadilek, who previously spent nine years at Google working on confidential projects. 

In a LinkedIn post this week, Sadilek wrote that “we're asking the wrong questions about AI and work,” arguing that automation will enable construction companies to build more with their existing teams.

“The top line grows, but the bottom line doesn't get ‘optimized' into oblivion,” he wrote. “For example, each autonomous dozer we deploy uncovers, depending on the mineral type and current market price, between $3 million and $17 million in additional ore each season. Rather than replacing people, that gives them leverage. And yes, cost savings show up – fuel, maintenance, wear – but they're not the main event.”

He added: “Instead of focusing on whether AI removes jobs, we should be focusing on whether we'll use it to finally do more of the things we've always wanted but never had enough capacity to build.”

A three-person clean energy team in Seattle is chasing China in pursuit of an increasingly popular alternative to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Emerald Battery Labs, a startup working out of the University of Washington, recently raised just under $1.1 million in a pre-seed round to continue scaling its sodium-ion battery technology. 

The burgeoning energy storage option avoids the use of lithium, which is highly sought, difficult to extract and has limited U.S. production. Sodium, by comparison, is much cheaper and comes from the same element that's in table salt. The sodium-ion batteries also last longer and present fewer fire concerns. 

Battery demand is rising rapidly as these systems pair with renewable, intermittent sources like sun and wind; enhance hydro dam capacity; provide backup power for data centers; power drones and defense devices; and work with EV charging stations to reduce grid strain during peak demand.

“As battery chemistries evolve, as technology evolves, people are going to find new ways to use energy storage technology,” said David Bell, Emerald's co-founder and chief product officer.

A recent Sightline Climate survey of investors and entrepreneurs in climate tech selected sodium-ion batteries as a top-pick for a 2026 breakthrough technology, coming in just behind the use of AI for clean tech materials discovery.

But there's already a clear leader in the space. 

“China, with its powerful EV industry, has led the early push” into sodium-powered batteries, according to MIT Technology Review. 

Chinese auto and battery makers Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, and BYD are in hot pursuit of the technology, MIT reports. CATL claims to have a sodium-ion battery line operating at scale, while BYD is building its own massive production facility. 

U.S. competitors include Peak Energy, Nanode Battery Technologies and Unigrid.

While this alternative chemistry offers numerous benefits, there's an important trade off: it's less energy dense — meaning sodium-ion batteries need to be larger than competing technologies to deliver the same amount of power.

Emerald is operating out of the UW's CoMotion Labs and using the university's Clean Energy Testbeds for fabrication work. The startup is scaling production and looking for partners to pilot test its products. 

It plans to hire additional employees in the coming year. Emerald's investors include Seattle-based E8, a network of angel investors that backs clean-tech companies; network members who directly invested; and an undisclosed family venture office.  

Emerald's founders bring deep battery experience:

AI Mode, Google's conversational Search feature for complex questions, is getting more personalized. The tech giant announced on Thursday that it's bringing “Personal Intelligence” to AI Mode, enabling it to tap into your Gmail and Google Photos to provide more individualized responses.

The company debuted Personal Intelligence last week in the Gemini app to allow the AI assistant to tailor its responses by connecting across your Google ecosystem, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.

The opt-in feature is now starting to roll out to AI Mode to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in English in the U.S. 

By bringing Personal Intelligence to Gemini and AI Mode, Google is leveraging the wealth of user data already within its ecosystem. Since users already rely on services like Gmail and Photos, Google can deliver more personalized experiences that rivals can't easily match. Of course, not everyone wants AI looking at their photos and emails, so you can turn Personal Intelligence on or off at any time.

“With Personal Intelligence, recommendations don't just match your interests — they fit seamlessly into your life,” Robby Stein, VP of Product, Google Search, explained in a blog post. “You don't have to constantly explain your preferences or existing plans, it selects recommendations just for you, right from the start.”

Say you're planning a vacation and searching for things to do and places to eat that everyone in your family will enjoy. With Personal Intelligence, AI Mode can draw on your hotel booking in Gmail and past travel memories in Google Photos to suggest a tailored itinerary with something for everyone. For example, you might see recommendations like an old-timey ice cream parlor based on the many ice cream selfies stored in Google Photos.

Google notes that AI Mode won't just give you a generic list of restaurants and activities; it instead provides a personalized starting point for planning.

“Personal Intelligence can also be particularly helpful for shopping, because AI Mode considers the types of items you buy and where you shop,” Stein wrote. “If you need a new coat for your upcoming trip, AI Mode could automatically take into account the brands you prefer, as well as your flight confirmation in Gmail to identify the destination and timing (Chicago in March). You'll get suggestions for windproof, versatile coats that fit the weather and your preferred look. It's like a personal shopper who already knows your itinerary and the vibe you're going for.”

Google says other questions you could ask are: “Make a scavenger hunt for [partner's name] to celebrate our anniversary. For each location, include a hint about us,” or “I'm decorating [child's name ]'s bedroom, give me ideas for a theme and suggestions for decor.”

The company notes that AI Mode doesn't train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library. Instead, it trains on specific prompts and the model's responses.

TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government.

As a result, U.S. users have often found themselves caught in the middle of this tension. Last year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store in February. 

A number of investors competed to purchase the app, and after President Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, the battle is finally over. As of December, TikTok officially signed a deal to divest a portion of its U.S. entity to a group of American investors. And now the deal is set to close this week, Semafor reported on Thursday.

This comes nearly three months after President Trump signed an executive order that approves the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to an American investor group.

A week prior, President Trump announced that President Xi Jinping of China had given his approval of a TikTok deal, which would allow a consortium of U.S. investors to control the platform. ByteDance stated publicly that it would ensure the platform remains available to American users.

According to a memo viewed by TechCrunch, the investor group consists of Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and investment firm MGX. Collectively, they will hold 45% of the U.S. operation, with ByteDance keeping nearly a 20% stake. Axios first reported the news, citing sources who estimate TikTok U.S. is valued at approximately $14 billion — a figure also mentioned by Vice President JD Vance.

In September, a report indicated that a “framework” deal was established between the U.S. and China, with a consortium of investors — including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz — overseeing TikTok's U.S. operations. These investors were expected to hold an 80% stake, and the remaining shares would belong to Chinese stakeholders.

The newly formed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC” will oversee the app's operations, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.

Oracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to the memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.

A White House official previously said Oracle would replicate and secure a new U.S. version of the algorithm, and the U.S.-based TikTok owners could lease the algorithm from ByteDance, which Oracle will then retrain. 

ByteDance will not have access to information about TikTok's U.S. users or any influence over the U.S. algorithm.

​The deal was scheduled to close on January 22, 2026, so hopefully we'll learn more soon.

Reports from Bloomberg indicate that when the deal is finalized, the TikTok app will be discontinued in the U.S. and users will need to transition to a new platform. However, the specifics of this platform remain largely unclear, including its features and how it will differ from the original app. 

To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we'll first revisit the timeline of TikTok's tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations. 

The drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance. 

A month later, Trump's administration sought to force a sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump's executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded. 

Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. After the Senate passed the bill against TikTok, President Joe Biden signed it.

In response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.

Fast-forward to 2024: Trump had a change of heart since his first term and is trying to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company. 

There have been several contenders, including The People's Bid for TikTok , a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt. This group has the support of investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Supporters include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, TV personality and investor Kevin O'Leary, inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, and senior research scientist David Clark.

Another group, called the American Investor Consortium, is led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley and includes Roblox co-founder David Baszucki, Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, and famous YouTuber MrBeast.

Others in the running included Amazon, AppLovin, Microsoft, Perplexity AI, Rumble, Walmart, Zoop, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

The story has been updated after publication.

The top talent behind yet another promising AI startup has been gobbled up by an incumbent. As part of a new licensing agreement, Google DeepMind is bringing on the CEO and several of the top engineers at voice AI startup Hume AI, reports Wired.

What's left of Hume AI will continue to supply its technology to other AI firms. No financial details of the deal were shared. 

TechCrunch has reached out to Google and Hume AI to confirm the news.

CEO Alan Cowen and about seven other engineers will work with DeepMind to improve Gemini's voice features, according to Wired. 

The Hume acqui-hire is the latest example of a leading AI firm scooping top talent off the market and skirting regulatory scrutiny by acquiring a startup's team rather than the company outright. Last year, Google acquired viral AI coding startup Windsurf's CEO and other top researchers, and OpenAI has acquired several startup teams in recent months, including Convogo and Roi. The Federal Trade Commission recently said that it would take a closer look at such deals. 

The deal also shows that voice is becoming the next frontier in AI.

Hume AI's secret sauce is its model's ability to understand a user's emotions and mood based on their voice. In 2024, the startup launched its Empathetic Voice Interface, a conversational AI with emotional intelligence. Hume AI has raised close to $80 million to date according to PitchBook, and expects to bring in $100 million in revenue this year, per Wired. 

But Hume AI isn't the only company working on voice-focused models. Google has been steadily improving its Gemini Live feature, which allows a user to have conversations with the chatbot. Last month, Google released a new native audio model for the Live API that improved the model's ability to “handle complex workflows,” per the Gemini API release notes. 

Others in the industry are investing big into voice capabilities as well. OpenAI is reportedly preparing to overhaul its audio models in preparation for its audio-first personal device, created with Jonny Ive's io, to launch this year. Recent leaks suggest the device could be a form of earbuds.

Last year, Meta also accelerated its AI audio push by acquiring startup Play AI. The Facebook-maker's Ray-Ban smart glasses are increasingly relying on voice and audio capabilities for tasks like helping you hear conversations in noisy rooms and enabling hands-free control for calls, texts, music, and photos. 

“Voice is the only acceptable input mode for wearables,” investor Vanessa Larco told TechCrunch. “This acquisition will only accelerate the need for voice apps.”

Demand continues to increase for voice capabilities. Earlier this month, ElevenLabs, the AI voice generation startup, said it crossed $330 million in annual recurring revenue.

Spotify is rolling out Prompted Playlists, a new AI playlist creation tool, to Premium subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. The feature, which was originally tested in New Zealand, allows users to make a playlist by describing what they want to hear, in their own words.

Prompted Playlists builds on an earlier AI playlist product, launched in 2024, which allowed for simpler prompts like “get focused at work with instrumental electronica,” or “get pumped up with fun, upbeat, and positive songs.”

Instead, the new Prompted Playlists feature lets users explain in more detail, and in a conversational mode, what they want to hear.

In a demo to press, for example, Spotify showed off a playlist that was built on a long prompt, which read “Find me one artist I haven't listened to yet, but would probably love, or an artist I've only heard one or two songs from, and introduce me to them. Build a playlist of songs that'll give me an overview of their catalog so it feels like I'm getting to know them. Put the songs you think I'll like the most in the top five spots.” 

The idea behind the new feature, explains J.J. Italiano, head of Global Music Curation and Discovery at Spotify, is to make it possible for anyone to build a playlist, even if they don't know much about music curation or the correct words to use.

“For most people,  isn't a part of their job. You don't always have the time or the energy to keep building the perfect playlist every time your mood changes, and that's where prompted playlists will come in,” said Italiano, whose team makes popular Spotify playlists like Today's Top Hits, New Music Friday, and Rap Caviar, among others. “This gives listeners access to that creative process without needing to know genres, or years, or industry language. You don't need the right words. You just need your words.”

“If you can describe a feeling, you can make a playlist,” he added.

The AI behind the feature analyzes the world of music in real time, including “trends, charts, culture, and history,” Spotify says, as well as the user's entire listening history since joining the service.

While the playlists are personalized to their creator by default, users can also use the tool to help break out of their usual listening habits and get different recommendations. That is, they can specifically tell the AI not to use their own listening history as a reference point, or they can direct it to introduce them to songs they've never heard before, as in the example above.

The prompts don't have to include any musical terminology, either. For instance, users could ask for a playlist inspired by the weather or a favorite TV show.

Because the prompts are shareable, the feature could also lead to a new type of creator — one who makes AI prompts that others will want to try. While the prompt itself would be the same, each user's resulting playlist would differ, as it's personalized to their own tastes and listening history. They could then modify that playlist further, if they chose. 

Spotify says Prompted Playlists are the “next evolution” of its earlier AI playlist feature. The new version is more tuned into real-time music trends and culture, understands the full arc of a user's listening behavior — not just what they've listened to recently — and offers deeper control. However, the older AI playlist feature will not be shut down. Instead, the two products will live side-by-side, which could lead to consumer confusion, given the similarities.

The feature will have some usage limits in place because it's still in beta, and those could change over time. It's also only available in the English language for the time being.

The company couldn't say when Prompted Playlists would reach global subscribers, noting that it first wants to learn from these initial markets to inform future launches.

Two days after settling a lawsuit accusing Snapchat of causing social media addiction and mental health issues, Snap announced that it's introducing new parental controls. Parents and guardians can now use Snapchat's “Family Center” tool to see how much time their teen is spending on the platform, along with additional details about the new friends they add.

With these new features, Snap is likely looking to appease regulators and parents over concerns about safety and screen time on its platform.

Parents can now see the average amount of time their teen spent on Snapchat each day over the previous week. They can see how this time breaks down across different parts of the app, including chatting, snapping, creating with the camera, using Snap Map, or watching content on Spotlight and Stories.

While Family Center already allowed parents to see a full list of their teen's friends on Snapchat, they can now see how their teen likely knows a new user that they've added as a friend. For example, parents will be able to see whether they have mutual friends, are saved as a contact, or belong to shared communities.

“These trust signals make it easier for parents to understand new connections and have greater confidence that their teen is chatting with someone they know in real life,” Snap wrote in a blog post. “If a parent or guardian sees a new friend they aren't familiar with, they have the information they need to start a productive conversation.”

Snap launched Family Center in 2022 — a suite of parental monitoring tools — in response to regulatory pressure over social media companies' failure to protect minors on their apps. Since then, Snap has built out the tool with additional features, including the ability to see who teens have recently interacted with, set time restrictions, and block access to the app's My AI chatbot.

The new features come as Snap earlier this week settled a lawsuit filed by a 19-year-old identified in court documents as K.G.M., who accused the company and other social media giants of designing algorithms and features that fueled addiction and harmed users' mental health.

The lawsuit also names other platforms, including Meta, YouTube, and TikTok, but no settlements have been reached with these companies. The remaining case against Meta, TikTok, and YouTube is set to proceed with jury selection beginning next.

Snap is still a defendant in other social media addiction cases. According to documents disclosed in the ongoing cases, Snap employees raised concerns about risks to teens' mental health as far back as nine years ago. The company has said the examples were “cherry-picked” and taken out of context.

Clothing and fitness data company Under Armour said it is investigating claims of a data breach after a cybercriminal posted millions of customer records to a hacker forum.

The seller told TechCrunch that the data was taken in a November data breach, which the Everest ransomware gang claimed responsibility for in a post on its dark web leak site at the time. 

News of the data theft became more widely known this week after breach notification site Have I Been Pwned obtained a copy of the stolen data, and notified 72 million individuals by email that their information had been compromised.

Have I Been Pwned said the stolen Under Armour dataset included names, email addresses, genders, dates of birth, and customers' approximate location based on postcode or ZIP code. The data also included information relating to purchases.

The seller provided TechCrunch with a sample of the stolen data, which appears to contain millions of records of Under Armour customer purchases and matched the types of data that Have I Been Pwned had reported. The stolen data contains reams of email addresses belonging to Under Armour employees.

When reached for comment, Under Armour spokesperson Matt Dornic told TechCrunch that the company is “aware of claims that an unauthorized third party obtained certain data.”

“Our investigation of this issue, with the assistance of external cybersecurity experts, is ongoing. Importantly, at this time, there's no evidence to suggest this issue affected UA.com or systems used to process payments or store customer passwords,” the spokesperson added.

“What we know at this time is the number of affected customers with any sort of information that could be considered sensitive is a very small percentage,” said Dornic. 

The spokesperson did not immediately respond to a follow-up email asking what types of customers' information Under Armour considers “sensitive” information, nor did he provide an accurate figure of how many customers are affected by the breach.

“Any implication that sensitive personal information of tens of millions of customers has been compromised is unfounded,” the spokesperson said.

Under Armour did not say if it planned to notify customers whose information was compromised. It did not say if it had received any correspondence from the hackers, such as a demand for ransom.

Honestly bug bounties are kind of miserable for both sides. I've worked on the recieving side of bug bounty programs. You wouldnt believe the shit that is submitted. This was before AI and it was significant work to sort through, i can only imagine what its like now. On the other hand for a submitter, you are essentially working on spec with no garuntee your work is going to be evaluated fairly.

Sadly, yeah. And will do anything only if they believe they can actually be caught.An EU-wide bank I used to be customer of until recently, supported login with Qualified Electronic Signatures, but only if your dongle supports... SHA-1. Mine didn't. It's been deprecated at least a decade ago.A government-certified identity provider made software that supposedly allowed you to have multiple such electronic signatures plugged in, presenting them in a list, but if one of them happened to be a YubiKey... crash. YubiKey conforms to the same standard as the PIV modules they sold, but the developers made some assumptions beyond the standard. I just wanted their software not to crash while my YubiKey is plugged in. I reported it, and they replied that it's not their problem.

If I have to pay money to submit a vulnerability to the developers with no guarantee that I'll even get refunded for a high quality and good faith report, let alone any actual payout, there's much less incentive for me to do so compared to selling them to someone else who won't charge me money for the privilege.

reply

We wanted to encourage white hat security researchers to look at our domain rather than other domains so we could collect more data on the kinds of vulns that appeared in our domain to help prioritize efforts that would fix the root causes of recurring bug patterns.I've also submitted bug bounties and received rewards and I've worked with a bunch of other people who have done this. At no point did I even consider selling on the black market and I suspect that my friends from grad school were the same way.Maybe the $1,000,000 bounties for zero click rce on iphones or whatever exist to discourage selling on the black market, but I'm not even sure that is true. ""Well, I'll just find a way to sell this to the russian mob"" is not exactly something that is on the radar of the vast majority of security researchers.

I personally came to that conclusion thanks to the GrapheneOS situation regarding device attestation. Insecure devices get full features from some apps because they are certified, although they cite security, while GrapheneOS get half featured apps because it's ""insecure"" (read, doesn't have the Google certification, but are actually the most secure devices you can get, worldwide)

It's not about securing your device from external threats or bad actors; it's about securing the organization from any blame / wrongdoing.Most organizations today are looking high and low to shove the blame to others instead of taking responsibility.

I refer to this as the Notion-to-Confluence cost border.When Notion first came out, it was snappy and easy to use. Creating a page being essentially free of effort, you very quickly had thousands of them, mostly useless.Confluence, at least in west EU, is offensively slow. The thought of adding a page is sufficiently demoralizing that it's easier to update an existing page and save yourself minutes of request time outs. Consequently, there's some ~20 pages even in large companies.I'm not saying that sleep(15 * SECOND) is the way to counter, but once something becomes very easy to do at scale, it explodes to the point where the original utility is now lost in a sea of noise.

Ironically, the cordless vacuum is even better than vacuum robots in this regard! I was surprised to hear from some friends and acquaintances that they prefer the manual vacuum to robotic one, and find it a better time/effort saver - but I eventually realized they're right, simply because the apps for controling the robotic vacuums are all steaming piles of shit, and their bad UI alone turns activating the robot into primary activity. It may be a brief activity, but it still requires full focus.

Our cordless, on the highest suction setting, is bordering on unusable. The effort to move it across carpet becomes quite high. Trying to roll it on an area rug tends to cause it to drag the rug around, and if you pick it up while on it will pull the rug up off the floor.I have done some _very_ scientific testing here, vacuuming a section of carpet on the lowest section (doing lines where each pass half-overlapped the previous so each part of the carpet got touched once in each direction), emptying the vacuum, then going back over doing the same on high. Didn't see anything else come up. Shop vac didn't pull anything else out either that I could see.I used to be in a similar boat of ""these are a stupid class of product"", but end of the day even if it takes eight passes my wife was going to use it anyway. The effort for her to set the time aside to drag around the heavier corded vacuum which is a substantial effort for her, etc, would be more than doing eight passes with a cordless. So got a good one and I'm sold on it now--it is quite convenient, and it does work.Only thing I will say is the battery definitely can't do an entire carpeted house on a charge. We don't have that much carpet, so don't have any problem cleaning all the floors and a couple area and entry-way rugs on a charge.

Dyson cordless vac, older (v8 ultimate). Have had to replace battery once and broken trigger. Continues to be a workhorse.Roborock s5v: I have it run 2x / day on weekdays, once in the morning after breakfast when we're taking the kids to school (vac kitchen only), and once after bedtime (vac + mop entire area). It does a great job of generally keeping things clean. Not perfect, but the overall dirt level stays low.The cordless manual vac is really useful for ""oh bleep, 8yo just spilled MORE stuff on the ground"". I keep it next to the dining and kitchen area. It's not super aesthetic having it hanging on the wall in a visible location but I have engineer-itis and I value the convenience over the illusion that we don't own a vacuum. :) I approximately never use the robovac as an on-demand vacuum unless it's to run an extra pass when we're leaving home on a weekend and have left crumbs from a meal.For us, substantially upping the frequency of vacuuming, even if it's not quite as deep, has made a big difference, and it's basically no extra burden to have the robovac run frequently after programming it.

The quote from example from early in the article stuck with me for years:Think about this for a second. The human longing for freedom of information is a terrible and wonderful thing. It delineates a pivotal difference between mental emancipation and slavery. It has launched protests, rebellions, and revolutions. Thousands have devoted their lives to it, thousands of others have even died for it. And it can be stopped dead in its tracks by requiring people to search for ""how to set up proxy"" before viewing their anti-government website.(Now this is more poetic, but I suppose the much more insightful example that also stuck with me is given later - companies enticing you to buy by offering free money, knowing well that most customers can't be arsed to fill out a form to actually get that money.)--[0] - https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/reitXJgJXFzKpdKyd/beware-tri...

It's credit cards that have to reimburse for fraud, but they charge the merchant for it, plus fees, so they have absolutely no incentive to prevent fraud, if not an incentive to outright encourage fraud.  That would explain why their implementation of the already compromised EMV was further nerfed by a lack of a PIN in the US.

At a bank? No way. They are some of the most customer-hostile organizations I've interacted with. Dealing with payment accounts is a necessary evil for them, and they are very much aware of the effort required to switch to a different bank, and of the massive regulatory moat preventing consumer-friendly competition from popping up.A bank doesn't care about screwing over a handful of customers. As long as it's not common enough to draw the attention of the press and/or a regulatory agency, they are not going to spend any money on improving.

I wonder if a better model would be to make the platform pay to entry, but not the specific bugs? So you have to pay a fee to gain access to a platform like HackerOne, and if your signal:noise ratio gets too bad then your account gets revoked? That would make it feel like less of a gamble than having to pay for every individual bug - but still has the same problem that it's putting a big barrier in front of legitimate good-faith researchers.

The problem is that bug bounty slop works. A lot of companies with second-tier bug bounties outsource triage to contractors (there's an entire industry built around that). If a report looks plausible, the contractor files a bug. The engineers who receive the report are often not qualified to debate exploitability, so they just make the suggested fix and move on. The reporter gets credit or a token payout. Everyone is happy.Unless you have a top-notch security team with a lot of time on their hands, pushing back is not in your interest. If you keep getting into fights with reporters, you'll eventually get it wrong and you're gonna get derided on HN and get headlines about how you don't take security seriously.In this model, it doesn't matter if you require a deposit, because on average, bogus reports still pay off. You also create an interesting problem that a sketchy vendor can hold the reporter's money hostage if the reporter doesn't agree to unreasonable terms.

For some reason they either didn't notice (e.g. there's just too many people trying to get in on it), or did notice, but decided they don't care. Deposit should help here: companies probably will not do it, so when you see a project requires a deposit, you'll probably stop and think about it.

reply

And likely even if they DO move on, there's a thousand more right behind them having bought a “get rich quick” kit from someone.

reply

If filing a bad report costs money, low quality reports go down. Meanwhile anyone still doing it is funding your top notch security team because then they can thoroughly investigate the report and if it turns out to be nothing then the reporter ends up paying them for their time.

If a PR is submitted by someone who is then known to submit slops, they can be easily ignored by the maintainers.EDIT: Or may be something like SponsorBlock for youtube. There could be a browser extension that will collectively tag sloppers the sameway and can help identify sloppers.

The what now? Open source doesn't have a business model, it's all about the licensing.FOSS is about making code available to others, for any purpose, and that still works the same as 20 years ago when I got started. Some seem to wake up to what ""for any purpose"" actually mean, but for many of us that's quite the point, that we don't make choices for others.

Like I said, there is a part that should be illegal, and then part where that's used to additionally harm one of the ways that OSS can be sustainable. The second part on its own is not illegal but adds to damages and is perfectly okay to condemn.Open source software can have business models, it's one of the ways it can be sustainable. It can work like, for example, the code is made available (for any purpose) and the core maintainer company provides services, like with Nginx (BSD). Or there is an open-source software, and companies create paid products and services on top while respecting the terms of that software and contributing back, like with Linux (GPL) and SUSE/Red Hat.

Ok?

But ""open source"" the ecosystem has nothing to do with that, it's for-profit companies trying to use and leverage open source, rather than the open source community suddenly wanting to do something completely different from what it's been doing since inception.

I'll remind then. Our discussion follows the top statement ""It seems open source loses the most from AI"". As far as I understand nobody narrowed the context to ""what is currently legal"". Something can be technically legal and still harmful to open source. Also, laws are never perfect and sometimes they need to be updated.(For example, I know that a number of people would say US abducting and detaining citizens and brutally deporting immigrants is not illegal, but if it's technically legal does that make it OK?)>  what it's been doing since inception.At inception open source was mostly personal side projects for funsies (like Linux) sponsored by maintainer having a dayjob. The big leap happened when copyleft licenses made it such that success of a big commercial company building products on open-source projects would directly improve these open-source projects. And it's nothing new, it happened long time ago. The desire for volunteer contributions to codebase to remain for public benefit in perpetuity is exactly the point of strong copyleft, and it's exactly what's being circumvented by LLM washing. The fact that these LLMs subsequently also harm open source communities adds insult to injury.

(I mean, it's a crazy idea still, but unfortunately not to everyone.)One can suggest that free software ideology should be expanded to include software itself in the beneficiaries of the license, not just human society. That's a big call and needs a lot of proof that software can decide things on its own, and not just do what humans tell it.

At worst you are trying to disparage the entire idea of open source by painting the people who championed it as idiots who cannot tell fiction from reality. At best you are making a fool of yourself.

It's motivated ""reasoning.""Without this ""FOSS is for learning"" thing you think overrules the license, you are no more justified in training off of it without complying with the terms than training on pirated Microsoft code without complying with their terms.

On another note, regarding AI replacing most open source code. I forget what tool it was, but I had a need for a very niche way of accessing an old Android device it was rooted, but if I used something like Disk Drill it would eventually crap out empty files. So I found a GUI someone made, and started asking Claude to add things I needed for it to a) let me preview directories it was seeing and b) let me sudo up, and let me download with a reasonable delay (1s I think) which basically worked, I never had issues again, it was a little slow to recover old photos, but oh well.I debated pushing the code changes back into github, it works as expected, but it drifted from the maintainers own goals I'm sure.

That's the choice as seen from the perspective of a white-hat hacker.

In many ways one of the biggest benefits of bug bounties is having a dedicated place where you can submit reports and you know the person on the other end wants them and isn't going to threaten to sue you.For the most part, the money in a bug bounty isn't work the effort needed to actually find stuff. The exception seens to be when you find some basic bug, that you can automate scan half the internet and submit to 100 different bug bounties.

It's the same as if you searched the web for a specific conclusion. You will get matches for it regardless of how insane it is, leading you to believe it is correct. LLMs take this to another level, since they can generate patterns not previously found in their training data, and the output seems credible on the surface.Trusting the output of an LLM to determine the veracity of a piece of text is a baffilingly bad idea.

This is precisely the point.  The LLM has to overcome its agreeableness to reject the implied premise that the report is stupid.  It does do this but it takes a lot, but it will eventually tell you ""no actually this report is pretty good""The point being filtering out slop, we can be perfectly find with false rejections.The process would look like ""look at all the reports, generate a list of why each of them is stupid, and then give me a list of the ten most worthy of human attention"" and it would do it and do a half-decent job at it.  It could also pre-populate judgments to make the reviewer's life easier so they could very quickly glance at it to decide if it's worthy of a deeper look.

You cannot trust that it'll do a good job on all reports so you'll have to manually review the LLMs reports anyways or hope that real issues didn't get false-negatives or fake ones got false-positives.This is what I've seen most LLM proponents do: they gloss over the issues and tell everyone it's all fine.

They don't review the gigantic pile of slop code/answers/results they generate. They skim and say YOLO. Worked for my narrow set of anecdotal tests, so it must work for everything!IIRC DOGE did something like this to analyze government jobs that were needed or not and then fired people based on that. Guess how good the result was?This is a very similar scenario: make some judgement call based on a small set of data. It absolutely sucks at it. And I'm not even going to get into the issue of liability which is another can of worms.

I'm not talking about completely replacing humans, the goal of this exercise was demonstrating how to use an LLM to filter out garbage.  Low quality semi-anonymous reports don't deserve a whole lot of accuracy and being conservative and rejecting most reports even when you throw out legitimate ones is fine.You seem like regardless of evidence presented, your prejudices will lead you to the same conclusions, so what's the point discussing anything?

The problem is the complete stupidity of people. They use LLMs to convince the author of the curl that he is not correct about saying that the report is hallucinated. Instead of generating ten LLM comments and doubling down on their incorrect report, they could use a bit of brain power to actually validate the report. It does not even require a lot of skills, you have to manually tests it.

It's shocking to me how often it happens. Aside from just the necessity to be able to prove something works, there are so many other benefits.Cost and model commoditization are part of it like you point out. There's also the potential for degraded performance because of the shelf benchmarks aren't generalizing how you expect. Add to that an inability to migrate to newer models as they come out, potentially leaving performance on the table. There's like 95 serverless models in bedrock now, and as soon as you can evaluate them on your task they immediately become a commodity.But fundamentally you can't even justify any time spent on prompt engineering if you don't have a framework to evaluate changes.Evaluation has been a critical practice in machine learning for years. IMO is no less imperative when building with llms.

The submissions that actually get upvoted are indeed pretty good. I think it really is the filtering effect. Standards are whatever, since it's clear that a lot of these submissions are close to one-shot (and even when they would have required some refinement, people don't actually push a meaningful commit history) with an obnoxious LLM house style promotional README.Often the submission also comes across LLM-generated, including heavy use of Markdown formatting. It gives the impression that people learn that HN is a place to promote themselves, but don't realize how blatantly obvious it is that they didn't actually do anything significant beyond thinking of something for Claude to do[1] and don't care about learning how the site works.[1] I'm not claiming that work done with coding agents will always be blatantly obvious. I'm claiming that this is the default result for people who don't put in any effort, and lack of effort correlates with lack of understanding.

Yeah I corrected myself in another comment.  But I find with submissions to `shownew` they don't enter `top` straight away, or at all.> You get a lot more traffic over a longer period of timeWith a regular submission, it gets on `top` for at least a short period of time as well as `new`, whereas that doesn't seem to always be the case for a Show HN.  And certainly not in my case.  That said, many Show HNs do make it to top with less votes than the tiny few I got organically, so maybe I tripped some HN's filters?  Or maybe it was bad timing?  But if I post again, it'll be without the Show HN.

I think the frontpage is both a lot harder to get into, faster to get dropped from there, but obviously also has a lot more traffic. But the traffic from Show HN frontpage seems to engage more (again probably because of the mindset) and it stays there for a lot longer.Personally, when I want feedback about the idea and implementation, I'd go for Show HN, because you're out after comments and discussions then, not just traffic and views. But if traffic/views are what you care about, regular submission would do ""better"".

reply

Traffic and views can lead to comments and discussion.  I was definitely looking for feedback.  I think there's a minimum threshold of interest that's required before people start engaging.  But it could also be that my submission was super boring, or there was something else off-putting about it – I'd be surprised if it was the latter, because the HN audience isn't known for holding back on criticism.

It all depends on your goals but I've had similar thoughts and I decided I'm just making opinionated tool for myself that I'm perfectly fine with never making public. Since deciding on such path I think I actually moved closer to something that may be useful to others (but I'm still staying on that path for now).I don't know any online tool which would provide me which mine does, and frankly the reality nowadays seems that it could take me more to find one if it existed (testing along all those which does not quite fit, which I did), than creating a version custom tailored for myself. It's... interesting times.1. https://imgur.com/a/73sBI7G

That is a pretty interesting point. I've been running into that problem quite often recently.

Seeing the flood of low ambition projects led me to think about the issue. I was wondering if we needed a kind of ""proof of work"" to help sort the entries.
For instance counting a project number of contributors, number of commits, age of the project... Not that any of those metrics are good indicators or are hard to game, of course, but that could help triage good faith attempts from shallow LLM vomit.For the record, nobody's denying how useful LLMs are, but let's also acknowledge that they excel at things that have a lot of prior art, so by definition not really a good fit for show HN any more (in the past it may have been; But what was interresting in vibe coding has never been the end result but that it was possible at all, like a dancing bear.)

Right here. The problem is right here.Unfortunately, the internet is a race to the bottom. You need to hustle (euphemism for ""shamelessly spam"") for attention.

I say this as someone who received a lot of great feedback and had some interesting interactions after posting about a project of mine using ""Show HN"" a few years ago. I didn't need to spam anything to get the attention, but I admit maybe I just got very lucky, or maybe there were just fewer posts to ""compete"" with at the time (this was before the recent write-everything-with-AI-and-launch-it-out-there craze).Finally, I'm not making any moral judgments here, and if someone feels they need to do this to get the attention they want, then who am I to tell you otherwise. But we should be aware of what we're giving up when we overall tend to behave in such a way, even if it's the inevitable outcome.

The fact that it's all genAI stuff puts me off, but that might not be the same for everyone.I think crucially, if I wanted to do this kind of challenge, I would have a better experience just using an LLM chat directly, like “Generate me an image, then judge my description of it in <language>, and give me useful language learning hints according to my level of <level>”

I'll admit, ""janky"" is not very useful feedback. The first thing that gave me that impression was a couple of seconds of loading time showing just the background color, then the whole page background flashing white every time after clicking/tapping something in the onboarding. I get this both on iOS Safari and macOS Firefox. On iOS, the page also crashed at some point with the 'a problem repeatedly occured on <url>' message.Looking at it closer, seems like it's a Flutter web app, so I suppose this is to be expected and the experience is probably indeed better on the iOS/android builds, might be that I was judging too quickly.

Not disagreeing on that, but often this can be explained when someone lacks time. For some articles I can only skim over the top some comments; articles with like +30 comments I can barely read all and the article, so I focus just on the first page or so.> using AI that people are fatigued from itI think some accounts here are actually AI accounts. I have no data to prove this, but just the voting situation is very, very odd; I didn't notice this on reddit back when I used it, before retiring due to crazy moderators.

It was ever present.  I'm afraid there is no solution to botting without excluding most of the Internet from a given website.  HN has an even lower entry to barrier by not requiring an email as well.

That being said, I sometimes write projects with AI to get feedback fast and prototyping for my own personal use cases and share it here sometimesBut since the community doesn't show support in some cases, I move on with anything new which catches my curiosity/troubles me and build it againI open source most of the stuff but I know that its probably gonna get lost in a sea of AI slop & mine might not be better (I just ask LLM bots to create a simple main.go file to solve X and usually much of my simple projects end up being around 600 loc)I do feel like personal computing or making projects in domains you aren't familiar in to prototype just out of curiosity/your own pragramatic use case is probably what I feel like but long term, there should be a focus on actually transitioning from AI slop to something real if anyone plans to monetize something imo

I don't know but I feel like trust is the real bottleneck and I used to be happy about it but nowadays I feel like there is even a sense of distrust within the HN community where earlier I used to believe it was a more tightknit community but right now, with all political developments and bots and AI use itself for comments in HN.I think what's gonna happen is not just that we have to trust somebody but rather we have to trust our trust in them if that hopefully makes sense.We have to trust that we are trusting the right guy in a world where trust feels like being eroded and this is a decently bit of an uphill battleIt's also a community thing imo. People are more likely to trust the trust if others do too, We offload our judgement to others thinking that if they liked it then I am more willing to do so tooSo if your project gets trusted by a community, it can snowball but it needs the earlier momentum which I feel like a lot of projects aren't gonna reach since there's only enough snow (attention/trust for the most part)The biggest question is how to start the snowball effect reasonably.

I have tried to write my thought in another comment in here but the gist of that was suppose that I don't feel excited (comparatively, not by a long margin which is why asking the question in the first place, usually I use it just for prototyping/my own use case purpose) just writing code solely but I am interested in everything else from start to finishWould this be considered substance or not (considering if the idea is still decent lets say)? Or is the project considered more substance if its solely written by human codeBecause I feel like I remember simon's post in here about how he made an independent (I think HTML related tool) in python (iirc) using independent tests and so sort of simon's use cases are how I imagine AI use cases to be (reasonable for the very least)Would you consider this an anamoly (given simon is simon and he's probably the most well known blogger in here) or something repeatable?Or like, I am just curious whats substance is. Because I feel like I can build projects but they end up just being a github repo no explaination and I'd love to polish some off my old projects which are dusty with better substance and probably even share it on HN and if I don't do this, then it will still be partially better to know when I might make a project in future & I can try to keep that in my mind hopefully as well.

At the other (low-substance) end of the spectrum is ""lead generation tool"" or ""resume generator"" that was built in 3 hours (and not much works other than a signup page and a link to Product Hunt).

But it's hard to answer these kinds of specific questions in the hypothetical. The HN audience prizes originality, and sometimes the thing that gives a project substance is different to much of what's come before. Sometimes it's just a case of ""we know it when we see it"".

Like, not every project should be a show HN and that's okay. One can always create an interesting takeaway from any project and create an article about it and publish it on Hackernews as well.I think what I get the feeling is to find out how original your idea is. If your idea is really original, you can greatly benefit from SHOW HN. But if not, which is okay as well, creating a normal article might be more correct (if a key takeaway from a project can be established?)Or would you recommend a seperate place for such instead of Hackernews in this particular context?> Sometimes it's just a case of ""we know it when we see it"".Yes but isn't this also causing the issue where people think that their projects are great and upload show HN and just with AI the amount of projects have grown so large and the signal ratio has just been shrinked impacting real projects as wellI feel as if the people who Submit show Hn needs to ask themselves internally what they would feel about the project without any bias if the project was randomly viewed by them with 0 upvotes, would they ignore or click and read me or upvote and comment and if the project doesn't fit the sense then to not fill SHOW HN with complete garbage AI slop deployed on lovable or something.

why would it be different here?the struggle is to build consensus in an open and democratic forum and we've solved that problem via LLMs.

How many real people actually visit this page, browse submission, let alone consult the links, vote in earnest vs bot manipulation? Being on the front page of HN is valuable.You can't downvote submission (or at least I can't) so low quality posts score can't even really be corrected (except flagging I guess, which sometimes feels abused but that's another problem).

Like, If we are using AI to build yet another next.js App, then perhaps its me but I personally find it doesn't satisfy my curiosity.I want to see projects be written in niche languages and new languages and AI can be perfect for that. See which language you like the most and each language/idea has their own tradeoffs but just follow what you want and now you are less likely to be stuck.Of course though sometimes I create a python script first (I recently made a code where your png's/jpg's can automatically be updated in a slideshow like thing which I built with a custom youtube screenshot and I watched some lectures, pressed shift A and it can now have slides and I compile them to pdf and built another where I can have a pdf and then I can have a laser tool on pdf's because I love to study with notes where I can draw random things on page like whiteboard and erase them without hurting the text below for understanding._I think converted that python tkinkter gui to fyne golang out of curiosity yesterday and I feel both tools are great fwiwI think my point here is I'd much rather be willing to see some niche projects for ourselves and have it first meaningfully improve our lives & just experiment. I don't know not much for monetary gains but out of curiosity and seeing how far you can and cannot go.Just build things you like/want to exist in any way that you like till AI's so damn subsidized (I don't use any agents, just claude web's free version or aistudio for free, my projects are usually around 600-700locs so I can ask it to regenerate it completely and I am fine with much of it, Perhaps I just follow KISS to its core)You would find it funny but the problem's not in code generation but dependency management etc. atleast to me which is why I love uv scripts a lot but sometimes especially chatgpt doesn't know about uv script feature or hallucinates it hard on their web version so If I am building python applets I would paste uv script's complete docs to the LLM website I would be using.

Honestly, I used to be one of them. I recently saw a great library (atcute) that changed my opinion. I think most AI sceptics haven't had this experience. They saw AI slops and set their opinion: AI-generated codes are bad. I can't really blame them, though, because there are so many of AI slops.> anyone who is not incorporating it in some way (workflow or actual end product) is just holding themselves back.It's true. However, I think people who create AI slops are worse than those who don't use it. They are diligently making this world a worse place.

Imagine this was a birdwatching forum and you were arguing that posting LLM generated images of birds allows birdwatchers to work on ""watching"" birds that they would not have had the time to watch previously, and that this should be celebrated. It's missing the entire point.>The fact that it has opened the doors to allow developers work on ideas that they would not have had to the time to do previously should be celebrated in my opinion.They have the time, they just don't want to put in the effort. Resources and education have never been more widely or freely available. One of the biggest lies people tell about LLMs is that they ""democratize creativity."" They don't - they commoditize it. You aren't developing the app. You aren't writing the script. You aren't making the art. The billion dollar proprietary black box service you loaded a prompt into shat out an approximation of a product and maybe at best you tweaked some code (more likely just fed it back in to another LLM.)Yes, you wound up with a finished product of dubious quality that you probably don't even understand and can't discuss in any depth.  bravo. But it shouldn't surprise anyone that people here - who actually care about the journey and the process rather than simply getting to an MVP as quickly as possible - for the most part aren't going to be impressed and aren't going to care much about it.

Some people do want their food to be made by a chef sometimes even in front of them explaining them everything and the journey to them makes it worth itFor some people, it can be that the food that they buy from a shop nearby in front of them is goodFor some, they want the cooking to be done out of their visible range and just want the food servedAnd the last categories probably the ones who will go to supermarkets to get some chips with 3 months expiry date created in a large factoryHackernews to me feels like its 1 & 2 for me.

And the last categories probably the ones who will go to supermarkets to get some chips with 3 months expiry date created in a large factoryHackernews to me feels like its 1 & 2 for me. What you describe as birdwatching is much rather only 1st category to me.Like, in the 1st category people want to eat the special dish created by the trials of countless nights and passionOn the 2nd category, you are still witnessing a person but they are probably following a much more experience and in the start by say following tutorials or watching recipes. But they are much more democratizedI don't know, I don't go in hotels that much so I don't know the 1st part and how possible it is but I do go to 2nd category and I go around my local shops and see people make french fries and chat with them and ask how long have they been here and making french fries etc., they are willing to tell you everything.I do feel like ""AI slop"" is kind of the 2nd category because like I am not only just interested in whether or not this recipe's entirely unique but I am rather interested in everything around it, what infrastructure choices they make and what coding tech stack they used & are they passionate about the project or what did they end up creating the prototype for.the 3rd part is what I despise where think burger king or mcdonald etc. where the recipes come from franchise and everything comes and the person just serves you. All decisions are bland (think yet another nextjs app).I don't think much of us want HN to be a supermarket or another macD but do we want this to be a cooking show where chefs build the whole recipes to serve us or do we want it to be a lot of neighbourly shops who have friendly people working who will chat with us and we can eat the french fries they make :)(I love the french fries my neighbourhood makes, they are really spicy combine them with spring rolls and some drink or a good yogurt and it feels soo good lol, plus all of this costs less a 1$ or 2$ at most 3$ where I live, I can go and eat without worrying at all about the cost of eating outside usually if picked from the right shops)Although I have never had the opportunity of seeing a chef cook his own dish in such sense but I can imagine that its great & I would like them as well but to me hackiness includes both, them hacking around with recipes to build something nice and the other hacking around with infrastructure like what logo and how close they are to me and even things like pricing imo.I consider the latter to be like much more reachable than the former and to me I don't know how to explain but the idea of hackiness isn't just some clean final product, its also like just building something and gluing things and its messy too. And I love both of them both clean and messy hacking, I just want to know how much an human has been in the loop, where'd they get the idea and what they implemented in etc.I don't know I live in a small city connected to a large city and I feel like I enjoy much more the messy aspects whereas people from large cities are much more likely to want to go to a large hotel for a dine or have a more artisanal taste.So I have seen my fair share of people who want both.Right now, I feel like it honestly depends on how large or small community you feel HN is.If you consider HN to be too large aka you find it less likely to trust projects who get to here in the first place, you would want an artisanal person to build things for hand for you to enjoyBut if you consider HN to be small and there is just this idea of treating each person more individually and just this unwritten rule of law which generates more trust and faith in trying out new options even if they are hacky as long as I can sort of trust them decently and they are still involved in the loop and not completely 100% detached unlike say a large conglomerate franchise imoHonestly I want HN to be a small place and not a large place but I feel like even HN is a large place for me but the problem with completely small places or building one's own is that you don't get visitors at all.

And I love both of them both clean and messy hacking, I just want to know how much an human has been in the loop, where'd they get the idea and what they implemented in etc.I don't know I live in a small city connected to a large city and I feel like I enjoy much more the messy aspects whereas people from large cities are much more likely to want to go to a large hotel for a dine or have a more artisanal taste.So I have seen my fair share of people who want both.Right now, I feel like it honestly depends on how large or small community you feel HN is.If you consider HN to be too large aka you find it less likely to trust projects who get to here in the first place, you would want an artisanal person to build things for hand for you to enjoyBut if you consider HN to be small and there is just this idea of treating each person more individually and just this unwritten rule of law which generates more trust and faith in trying out new options even if they are hacky as long as I can sort of trust them decently and they are still involved in the loop and not completely 100% detached unlike say a large conglomerate franchise imoHonestly I want HN to be a small place and not a large place but I feel like even HN is a large place for me but the problem with completely small places or building one's own is that you don't get visitors at all. We probably need something in between HN and no social media promotions (only via word of mouth) imo.I have been trying to replace HN for quite a while now for something more nicher but still well connected place as well.

If you want a chef to explain and show his recipe and then you find out he asked chat gpt or got it from a recipe website, would you still be interested in hearing about the 'journey' he took?If that chef then also ordered the food from a catering service by forwarding that recipe to them, does it make sense to interview him about his craft and listen to him?It's the same with creative things. Sure, you can ask a musician or a painter about their inspiration/process etc., because they went through the process and made something. You could learn something from them, other than 'here's how i asked someone else to make this'.So, going to an art forum and displaying your AI generated art there, ready to answer questions about the process is pretty much completely pointless and also cheapens every actual artist that came there to display and talk about something they actually made.It also has a psychological effect on the people that use it. I know some people that get immense feelings of accomplishment out of using AI to generate art and music. They feel like they made something and are proud about it. For a lot of people like that, any incentive to learn about things is gone, because they get the exact same feeling by using AI to make it.On the other hand: If you are an artist making things and there are a million people generating things every 5 minutes and showing it around everywhere, it dilutes recognition of what you made. You show it to your friends and they're like: Oh yeah, i made like 5 of those yesterday.

Once again if HN is solely for the 1st sector of chefs 100%, then AI use should be completely restricted againstBut if HN falls into what I call the 2nd category too then does it really matter if the local chef's using a recipe built by chatgpt?I completely understand what you are saying man and the psychological effects are real.And this is why I feel like if Hackernews is targetted for people in the 1st category or the 2ndBecause if there is a forum where both local shops who say makes fries which are built in less time and there is also the chef which takes hours building teh perfect food and both of them are on the same forum & they probably get the same space in it then a conflict between them is sort of meant to occur with all the effects which you mention and feels to me like a prisoners dilemma because if artisanal chefs are impacted by local normal cooks lets say then just being a local cook would get stigmatized in a forum. Overall its a net negative for both.But it honestly depends on how negative if the eyeballs come on both, sure they can split and create different forums but neither wants to leave the large one and the large forum owner has had incentives in both artisanal and local cooks (YC funding AI companies and hackernews once being so damn creative that I hear stories about when one day the moderator decided to have the front page be all about erlang/elixir from a story I remember from a HN ""veteran"")I mean I love em both. It's not an or condition but honestly what I hear in HN is the path of least resistance ie. if you don't like moderation, then make your own place but I do feel like the moderation's atleast a bit confused about their interests too.Probably another reason why I am interested in fediverse because I want it to be like a street where we can have both artisanal chef clubs and the local shops fair while on the same road but a bit of problem with fediverse atleast in this context of HN alike is that lemmy's c/technology can probably replace HN in some contexts but the streets of lemmy are empty because everybody's still here on HN.

Sometimes the idea itself can be interesting. If AI is used to manifest the idea then so be it!Secondly, I think it is almost unavoidable to use some ai generated content (code, design etc) when developing these days. Its just a tool and it can be used well or used poorly.Lastly, I agree that there does exist a lot of what can truly be labelled ""AI slop"" where it is just lazy regurgitated content, and that is annoying.

But i also think the majority of these cases will be bad ideas that don't need to be made at all. Or even ideas that are AI generated by asking a LLM for ideas.
I don't care if they are made or not, but i would rather not have those on the internet and especially on 'show and tell' places like ShowHN etc.I'm also not opposed to using AI as a tool in development or similar. 
But there are more and more examples of purely vibe-coded or generated things and those fall in a different category in my opinion.

I am much more interested in infrastructure related things and price optimizing. I've spent hours and days looking at all the options compiling resources and building scrapers to scrape information of servers and having them be made via LLM :) just to get the idea of context.I don't know but like what i possess isn't a deep knowledge within the domain itself (one of the reasons why I love golang is that all the tradeoffs of it are okay with me and it's complexity just feels linear to me and I would have this simplicity in code where if I ever wanted to, I just feel so much more confident about tweaking LLM generated golang code than say rust)A lot of what I love is the hacking around the project. Ooh so you used golang to make it cross compatible easier? Are you using the modernc driver? What servers are you gonna use? (hetzner,ovh,netcup etc.) while the code being completely open source and I will be transparent about how much the servers cost and how much I make in the middle and just some sustainable ideals so that it can be day one profitable but without ripping anyone off.Y'know mixing and matching different services. I think I am really frugal so like this is like the deepest intersection of like all of my hobbies combined.I face any problem -> use free llm from web -> python/golang code -> deploy it on my web server -> use cloudflare tunnels and custom scripts + zed/others and micro to deploy servers great (I prefer using tmux as well with zed terminal)But even with all of this, I wouldn't say that the code isn't slop but I do feel like its pretty much reasonable and I have been vocal about how if I ever create something and a community actually occurs out of it & they want me to recreate it from scratch without any LLM assistance, I actually would even if that means reading documentations of all the libraries used in such golang project etc.But like the reason why I still do things is because I do it for myself and I am pretty impatient. I build things which trouble me first and foremost to fix issues I have & that's kind of source of joy I have.I don't know man, like I hate AI for all the psychological issues its gonna cause but I still want to build things without having to spend say days in a project when I would be facing the problem right now.I think I have always imagined myself as some consultant who wants to give the best option out there and have the code back and manage it or similar.It's just that writing the code part myself isn't the most exciting part to me. seeing computers go work the way I want to in the decision choices that I make and can justify is the most exciting part to me.Like does this make sense? I am not exactly pro AI either, I have written so extensively about it here on how AI is a bubble and the psychological and social impact it has.In a way, I don't think I fit in the two boxes of pro AI or completely anti AI. I just am in the middle and I don't know if there's a term for it but like, I don't know if someone knows a term for what I feel about AI it will be brilliant but even if there isn't a mainstream word for it. I just don't really want to change myself to fit in any box. I have my nuanced opinion and I have thought about joining either of these boxes but being honest neither fits my worldview.Does this make sense?

If you were able to get an LLM to vibecode a project for you, so could any of us, so why even share the project as if you are showing off? It takes very little effort for anyone else to prompt an agent and get a similar result.That means the only thing left in a shared vibecoded project is the original idea, and well, ideas are a dime a dozen and everyone has them and idea spread has never really been a limiting factor.So what are you really sharing at that point?Noise.""Look at this code I got an LLM to generate"" is inherently uninteresting.

The good news: we shipped our differential renderer to everyone today. We rewrote our rendering system from scratch[1] and only ~1/3 of sessions see at least a flicker. Very, very few sessions see flickers in rapid succession which was so annoying before. Those numbers will keep dropping as people update.We've also been working upstream to add synchronized output / DEC mode 2026 support to environments where CC runs and have had patches accepted to VSCode's terminal[2]  and tmux[3].

I'm not even using it particularly hard. Usually only one agent is running with possibly one sub-agent on occasion. Which is confusing because I've heard of people running ten at once and only then running into this issue...Possibly related, I DID only upgrade to the $200 tier a few days ago... might there be a now-stale API rate limit in place?? Or maybe it's the long-running multi-compacted context that's the problem?My account is tied to lumbergh-at-gmail-dot-comI'm a dev so of course, happy to help run it down from my endThis tool is amazing btw. I'm currently working on a never-existed-before app that would have been impossible before AI... And it's going quite well

It was obviously a complex issue (I appreciate that and your work!). But I think there's a lot to be improved on with communication. This issue in particular seems like it has lost a lot of user trust - not because it was hard to solve and took awhile - but because the comms and progress around it was so limited.Eg issues:* https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1913* https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/826* https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/3648

1. Since we no longer have <Static> components the app re-renders much more frequently with larger component trees. We were seeing unusual GC pauses because of having too much JSX... Better memoization has largely solved that.
2. The new renderer double buffers and blits similar cells between the front and back buffer to reduce memory pressure. However, we were still seeing large GC pauses from that so I ended up converting the screen buffer to packed TypedArrays.

reply

reply

For the GC pauses specifically, what mattered is predictable performance. More allocations == more GC == more frames where the VM is locked up seemingly doing nothing. On slower machines we were seeing this be in the order of seconds, not ms and when somebody is typing all they feel is the 1 character that's stuttering. Honestly, I was surprised about this too as GC in JS is often not something that's too impactful.

Besides the UI, it isn't much more than ""while llm hasn't made final response, interpret any tool calls and repeat"" to the current agents, what exactly would they be using from Claude Code if not the UI? Most of the stuff the agents do is fairly basic, implementation-wise.

basically, the rapid replay of the entire conversation history (the CC bug) somehow interacts destructively with something in tmux, causing it to be 10 times worse. The “flicker” becomes a multi-second delay while I wait twiddling my thumbs…i've seen this in every terminal, including ghostty… as nice as ghostty is, expecting everyone to use it is kinda meh (at least support Wezterm too, lol)

tl;dr other programs like Neovim and Codex use the ""alternate screen buffer"" which means they don't use scrollback and reimplement their own scrolling. CC uses scrollback (because that's what most users expect) which it has to clear entirely and redraw everything when it changes (causing tearing/flickering). There's no way to incrementally update scrollback in a terminal.(I also want to add some more flavor to the 1/3 metric because I don't want it to be mis-interpreted. ""30% of the time you use CC it flickers"" isn't quite accurate - it's dependent on screen height and what you do. Most people will not see _any_ flickers at all. Some people with short screens (typically VSCode users because by default the terminal opens fairly short) will see flickers. Previously, if something rendered offscreen users would see a flicker for _every subsequent frame_ regardless of wether anything was actually changing. Now they will only see a flicker occasionally when it's _absolutely_ needed. Once or twice vs thousands.Additionally, the metric really tracks when CC emits a ""clear scrollback"" operation. If the user is in a terminal that supports DEC 2026 they won't see a flicker even if we emit that clear scrollback command.)

Another option is to rebuild tmux from latest source so it buffers synchronized output, which should prevent the flicker entirely.If you're still seeing a terrible flicker please file a `/bug`!

I'm starting to think that the reason why anthropic doesn't open source Claude code isn't due to competitive reasons, it's because they don't want people to see what a mess their code base is.Maybe they bought Bun to increase the rate of flickering so that the text looks solid again

You probably mean GIL, as python has supported multi threading for like 20 years.Idk if ranger is slow because it is written in python. Probably it is the specific implementation.

They also probably mean TUIs, as CLIs don't do the whole ""Draw every X"" thing (and usually aren't interactive), that's basically what sets them apart from CLIs.

While not universally applicable, it's very convenient during development to focus on State without thinking about View, or focus on View without thinking about State.The concept itself has nothing to do with the actual renderer: HTML, TUI, or whatever. You can render your state to a text file if you want to.So the flickering is caused either by a faulty renderer, or by using a render target (terminal) that is incompatible with the UI behavior (frequent partial re-renders, outputting a lot of text etc.)

Any web react project out there will install react AND react-dom, which is the son implementation of react.It's how react translates into mobile, web, etc so well.It defines contracts and packages like react-dom handle th specific implementation.

Using TS, React here doesn't make sense for stability in the long term. As you can see, even when they replaced Ink and built their own, the problem still exists.There are other alternatives that are better than whatever Anthropic did such as Bubbletea (Go) or Ratatui (Rust) which both are better suited for this.Maybe they were thinking more about job security with TypeScript over technical correctness and a robust implementation architecture and this shows the lack of it.

if Amodei hadn't said ""90% of code will be written by AI"", at least I wouldn't call them hypocrites, but the fact that the company that makes such wild claims can't fix a freaking flicker and scroll issue until an indie-dev steps in just shows how far behind their product is from their claims.I have CC and use many models with it (Codex in CC, try it!), but I won't let Anthropic ""lecture"" us about how ""the roots of the problem go deep"". Literally no other CLI tool has these issues: opencode, codex, gemini, droid, etc.

To your point about hiring 1000 devs not solving anything: I agree. For a project of this scope, you're probably going to peak at one or two 3 person teams with at least one principal dev per team with deep experience in the tech stack and in architecting/building TUIs in general. I would hope their devs are making a relatively lucrative salary too, to attract talent.I have no idea what the internal structure is so this is just pure speculation: judging by the backlog of issues on their GH, they could use better community management and developer relations. I suspect they're riding on the existing hype/community interest to fulfill these functions but that only provides a piece of the puzzle.

I think thats probably 1 team short, but I agree on the order of magnitude. So if we assume 12 devs, how long do we think its going to take to fix 5k github issues lol?Again, I 100% agree the flicker bug should be at the top of the list. And I agree their products in general are riddled with bugs. But Im just saying I can understand the situation even if I think this specific bug should have been fixed already if they were regularly using a setup that runs into it (which I have to assume they arent).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Yann LeCun's new venture is a contrarian bet against large language models","https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131661/yann-lecuns-new-venture-ami-labs/","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT","

In an exclusive interview, the AI pioneer shares his plans for his new Paris-based company, AMI Labs.

Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry's current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems. 

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. He is also a staunch advocate for open-source AI and criticizes the closed approach of frontier labs like OpenAI and Anthropic. 

Perhaps it's no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company's influential research lab that he founded. Meta has struggled to gain much traction with its open-source AI model Llama and has seen internal shake-ups, including the controversial acquisition of ScaleAI. 

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas. 

Both the questions and answers below have been edited for clarity and brevity.

You've just announced a new company, Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI).  Tell me about the big ideas behind it.

It is going to be a global company, but headquartered in Paris. You pronounce it “ami”—it means “friend” in French. I am excited. There is a very high concentration of talent in Europe, but it is not always given a proper environment to flourish. And there is certainly a huge demand from the industry and governments for a credible frontier AI company that is neither Chinese nor American. I think that is going to be to our advantage.

So an ambitious alternative to the US-China binary we currently have. What made you want to pursue that third path?

Well, there are sovereignty issues for a lot of countries, and they want some control over AI. What I'm advocating is that AI is going to become a platform, and most platforms tend to become open-source. Unfortunately, that's not really the direction the American industry is taking. Right? As the competition increases, they feel like they have to be secretive. I think that is a strategic mistake.

It's certainly true for OpenAI, which went from very open to very closed, and Anthropic has always been closed. Google was sort of a little open. And then Meta, we'll see. My sense is that it's not going in a positive direction at this moment.

Simultaneously, China has completely embraced this open approach. So all leading open-source AI platforms are Chinese, and the result is that academia and startups, outside of the US, have basically embraced Chinese models. There's nothing wrong with that—you know, Chinese models are good. Chinese engineers and scientists are great. But you know, if there is a future in which all of our information diet is being mediated by AI assistance, and the choice is either English-speaking models produced by proprietary companies always close to the US or Chinese models which may be open-source but need to be fine-tuned so that they answer questions about Tiananmen Square in 1989—you know, it's not a very pleasant and engaging future. 

They [the future models] should be able to be fine-tuned by anyone and produce a very high diversity of AI assistance, with different linguistic abilities and value systems and political biases and centers of interests. You need high diversity of assistance for the same reason that you need high diversity of press. 

That is certainly a compelling pitch. How are investors buying that idea so far?

They really like it. A lot of venture capitalists are very much in favor of this idea of open-source, because they know for a lot of small startups, they really rely on open-source models. They don't have the means to train their own model, and it's kind of dangerous for them strategically to embrace a proprietary model.

You recently left Meta. What's your view on the company and Mark Zuckerberg's leadership? There's a perception that Meta has fumbled its AI advantage.

I think FAIR [LeCun's lab at Meta] was extremely successful in the research part. Where Meta was less successful is in picking up on that research and pushing it into practical technology and products. Mark made some choices that he thought were the best for the company. I may not have agreed with all of them. For example, the robotics group at FAIR was let go, which I think was a strategic mistake. But I'm not the director of FAIR. People make decisions rationally, and there's no reason to be upset.

So, no bad blood? Could Meta be a future client for AMI?

Meta might be our first client! We'll see. The work we are doing is not in direct competition. Our focus on world models for the physical world is very different from their focus on generative AI and LLMs.

You were working on AI long before LLMs became a mainstream approach. But since ChatGPT broke out, LLMs have become almost synonymous with AI.

Yes, and we are going to change that. The public face of AI, perhaps, is mostly LLMs and chatbots of various types. But the latest ones of those are not pure LLMs. They are LLM plus a lot of things, like perception systems and code that solves particular problems. So we are going to see LLMs as kind of the orchestrator in systems, a little bit.

Beyond LLMs, there is a lot of AI that is behind the scenes that runs a big chunk of our society. There are assistance driving programs in a car, quick-turn MRI images, algorithms that drive social media—that's all AI. 

You have been vocal in arguing that LLMs can only get us so far. Do you think LLMs are overhyped these days? Can you summarize to our readers why you believe that LLMs are not enough?

There is a sense in which they have not been overhyped, which is that they are extremely useful to a lot of people, particularly if you write text, do research, or write code. LLMs manipulate language really well. But people have had this illusion, or delusion, that it is a matter of time until we can scale them up to having human-level intelligence, and that is simply false.

The truly difficult part is understanding the real world. This is the Moravec Paradox (a phenomenon observed by the computer scientist Hans Moravec in 1988): What's easy for us, like perception and navigation, is hard for computers, and vice versa. LLMs are limited to the discrete world of text. They can't truly reason or plan, because they lack a model of the world. They can't predict the consequences of their actions. This is why we don't have a domestic robot that is as agile as a house cat, or a truly autonomous car.

We are going to have AI systems that have humanlike and human-level intelligence, but they're  not going to be built on LLMs, and it's not going to happen next year or two years from now. It's going to take a while. There are major conceptual breakthroughs that have to happen before we have AI systems that have human-level intelligence. And that is what I've been working on. And this company, AMI Labs, is focusing on the next generation.

And your solution is world models and JEPA architecture (JEPA, or “joint embedding predictive architecture,” is a learning framework that trains AI models to understand the world, created by LeCun while he was at Meta). What's the elevator pitch?

The world is unpredictable. If you try to build a generative model that predicts every detail of the future, it will fail.  JEPA is not generative AI. It is a system that learns to represent videos really well. The key is to learn an abstract representation of the world and make predictions in that abstract space, ignoring the details you can't predict. That's what JEPA does. It learns the underlying rules of the world from observation, like a baby learning about gravity. This is the foundation for common sense, and it's the key to building truly intelligent systems that can reason and plan in the real world. The most exciting work so far on this is coming from academia, not the big industrial labs stuck in the LLM world.

The lack of non-text data has been a problem in taking AI systems further in understanding the physical world. JEPA is trained on videos. What other kinds of data will you be using?

Our systems will be trained on video, audio, and sensor data of all kinds—not just text. We are working with various modalities, from the position of a robot arm to lidar data to audio. I'm also involved in a project using JEPA to model complex physical and clinical phenomena. 

What are some of the concrete, real-world applications you envision for world models?

The applications are vast. Think about complex industrial processes where you have thousands of sensors, like in a jet engine, a steel mill, or a chemical factory. There is no technique right now to build a complete, holistic model of these systems. A world model could learn this from the sensor data and predict how the system will behave. Or think of smart glasses that can watch what you're doing, identify your actions, and then predict what you're going to do next to assist you. This is what will finally make agentic systems reliable. An agentic system that is supposed to take actions in the world cannot work reliably unless it has a world model to predict the consequences of its actions. Without it, the system will inevitably make mistakes. This is the key to unlocking everything from truly useful domestic robots to Level 5 autonomous driving.

Humanoid robots are all the rage recently, especially ones built by companies from China. What's your take?

There are all these brute-force ways to get around the limitations of learning systems, which require inordinate amounts of training data to do anything. So the secret of all the companies getting robots to do kung fu or dance is they are all planned in advance. But frankly, nobody—absolutely nobody—knows how to make those robots smart enough to be useful. Take my word for it. 

You need an enormous amount of tele-operation training data for every single task, and when the environment changes a little bit, it doesn't generalize very well. What this tells us is we are missing something very big. The reason why a 17-year-old can learn to drive in 20 hours is because they already know a lot about how the world behaves. If we want a generally useful domestic robot, we need systems to have a kind of good understanding of the physical world. That's not going to happen until we have good world models and planning.

There's a growing sentiment that it's becoming harder to do foundational AI research in academia because of the massive computing resources required. Do you think the most important innovations will now come from industry?

No. LLMs are now technology development, not research. It's true that it's very difficult for academics to play an important role there because of the requirements for computation, data access, and engineering support. But it's a product now. It's not something academia should even be interested in. It's like speech recognition in the early 2010s—it was a solved problem, and the progress was in the hands of industry. 

What academia should be working on is long-term objectives that go beyond the capabilities of current systems. That's why I tell people in universities: Don't work on LLMs. There is no point. You're not going to be able to rival what's going on in industry. Work on something else. Invent new techniques. The breakthroughs are not going to come from scaling up LLMs. The most exciting work on world models is coming from academia, not the big industrial labs. The whole idea of using attention circuits in neural nets came out of the University of Montreal. That research paper started the whole revolution. Now that the big companies are closing up, the breakthroughs are going to slow down. Academia needs access to computing resources, but they should be focused on the next big thing, not on refining the last one.

You wear many hats: professor, researcher, educator, public thinker … Now you just took on a new one. What is that going to look like for you?

I am going to be the executive chairman of the company, and Alex LeBrun [a former colleague from Meta AI] will be the CEO. It's going to be LeCun and LeBrun—it's nice if you pronounce it the French way.

I am going to keep my position at NYU. I teach one class per year, I have PhD students and postdocs, so I am going to be kept based in New York. But I go to Paris pretty often because of my lab. 

Does that mean that you won't be very hands-on?

Well, there's two ways to be hands-on. One is to manage people day to day, and another is to actually get your hands dirty in research projects, right? 

I can do management, but I don't like doing it. This is not my mission in life. It's really to make science and technology progress as far as we can, inspire other people to work on things that are interesting, and then contribute to those things. So that has been my role at Meta for the last seven years. I founded FAIR and led it for four to five years. I kind of hated being a director. I am not good at this career management thing. I'm much more visionary and a scientist.

What makes Alex LeBrun the right fit?

Alex is a serial entrepreneur; he's built three successful AI companies. The first he sold to Microsoft; the second to Facebook, where he was head of the engineering division of FAIR in Paris. He then left to create Nabla, a very successful company in the health-care space. When I offered him the chance to join me in this effort, he accepted almost immediately. He has the experience to build the company, allowing me to focus on science and technology. 

You're headquartered in Paris. Where else do you plan to have offices?

We are a global company. There's going to be an office in North America.

New York, hopefully?

New York is great. That's where I am, right? And it's not Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley is a bit of a monoculture.

What about Asia? I'm guessing Singapore, too?

Probably, yeah. I'll let you guess. 

And how are you attracting talent?

We don't have any issue recruiting. There are a lot of people in the AI research community who think the future of AI is in world models. Those people, regardless of pay package, will be motivated to come work for us because they believe in the technological future we are building. We've already recruited people from places like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and xAI.

I heard that Saining Xie, a prominent researcher from NYU and Google DeepMind, might be joining you as chief scientist. Any comments?

Saining is a brilliant researcher. I have a lot of admiration for him. I hired him twice already. I hired him at FAIR, and I convinced my colleagues at NYU that we should hire him there. Let's just say I have a lot of respect for him.

When will you be ready to share more details about AMI Labs, like financial backing or other core members?

Soon—in February, maybe. I'll let you know.

Anthropic's Claude is getting a new constitution. On Wednesday, the company announced that the document, which provides a “detailed description of Anthropic's vision for Claude's values and behavior,” is getting a rewrite that will introduce broad principles that the company expects its chatbot to follow rather than the more stringent set of rules that it relied on in past iterations of the document.

Anthropic's logic for the change seems sound enough. While specific rules create more reliable and predictable behavior from chatbots, it's also limiting. “We think that in order to be good actors in the world, AI models like Claude need to understand why we want them to behave in certain ways, and we need to explain this to them rather than merely specify what we want them to do,” the company explained. “If we want models to exercise good judgment across a wide range of novel situations, they need to be able to generalize—to apply broad principles rather than mechanically following specific rules.”

Fair enough—though the overview of the new constitution does feel like it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of specifics. Anthropic's four guiding principles for Claude include making sure its underlying models are “broadly safe,” “broadly ethical,” “compliant with Anthropic's guidelines,” and “genuinely helpful.” Those are…well, broad principles. The company does say that much of the consitution is dedicated to explaining these principles, and it does offer some more detail (i.e., being ethical means “being honest, acting according to good values, and avoiding actions that are inappropriate, dangerous, or harmful”), but even that feels pretty generic.

The company also said that it dedicated a section of the constitution to Claude's nature because of “our uncertainty about whether Claude might have some kind of consciousness or moral status (either now or in the future).” The company is apparently hoping that by defining this within its foundational documents, it can protect “Claude's psychological security, sense of self, and well-being.”

The change to Claude's constitution and seeming embrace of the idea that it may one day have an independent consciousness comes just a day after Anthropic CEO and founder Dario Amodeo spoke on a World Economic Forum panel titled “The Day After AGI” and suggested that AI will achieve “Nobel laureate” levels of skills across many fields by 2027.

This peeling back of the curtain as to how Claude works (or is supposed to work) is on Anthropic's own terms. The last time we got to see what was happening back there, it came from a user who managed to prompt the chatbot to produce what it called a “soul document.” That document, which was revealed in December, was not an official training document, Anthropic told Gizmodo, but was an early iteration of the constitution that the company referred to internally as its “soul.” Anthropic also said its plan was always to publish the full constitution when it was ready.

Whether Claude is ready to operate without the bumpers up is a whole other question, but it seems we're going to find out the answer one way or another.

April Fools' Day is always an occasion to be very, very careful about what you read, see, or hear about, especially online—but this is confirmed to be real: MAD About DC, a team-up between the legendary humor magazine and legendary comics imprint that releases April 1. It's a 64-page one-shot guest-edited by yet another legend: Chip Zdarsky.

Your imagination has already put this together, but an official press release promises the issue “brings together an all-star lineup of writers and artists to lovingly roast, parody, and generally make a mess of the characters fans hold dear.”

Among those stepping up for the roast include Sergio Aragonés (“A MAD Look at Comic Book Stores”), Jim Zub and Ramon Perez doing “Guy vs. Spy,” and a DC take on the classic MAD fold-in by Charles Soule and Ryan Browne.

Other luminaries laying into DC's heroes, villains, and beloved tropes, filtered through MAD's trademark humor, include Kyle Starks, Dave Johnson, Tini Howard, Mattie Lubchansky, Mark Waid, Ty Templeton, Rainbow Rowell, Vita Ayala, M.L. Sanapo, Mark Russell, Steve Lieber, Jeff Parker, Lukas Ketner, Gerry Duggan, Scott Aukerman, Mitch Gerads, Joanne Starer, Joe Quinones, Scott Snyder, Josh Williamson, Deniz Camp, Gail Simone, Colleen Doran, Joe Kelly, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Valentine De Landro, Ryan North, Erica Henderson, Tom Taylor, Bruno Redondo, Mariko Tamaki, Riley Rossmo, Al Ewing, PJ Holden, Shannon Wheeler, Leah Williams, Isaac Goodhart, Cody Ziglar, Daniele Di Nicuolo, Daniel Kibblesmith, Brandt&Stein, Casey Gilly, J. Bone, Skottie Young, Andrew Wheeler, Stephen Byrne, Colleen Coover, Benjamin Errett, Matt Fraction, Kagan McLeod, Lee Gatlin, Joseph Starkey, Graham Roumieu, and more. Clearly, this was a popular pitch!

You can pick up a copy of MAD About DC wherever comics are sold April 1. The main cover is by Dan Panosian ($8); there will also be cardstock variants by Simon Bisley and Chip Zdarsky ($9), and a foil variant also by Panosian ($11).

If you're a Star Wars fan looking to bring a piece of the galaxy far, far away home, LEGO's Star Wars collection has plenty to love and explore. It features a range of building sets (starships, vehicles, locations), minifigures, and more for those who want to recreate the iconic moments, while also appreciating the finer details.

These sets usually start at around $50 and go past $100 for larger builds. If you're shopping for one today, you're in luck because Amazon has dropped the price of the 25th Anniversary Edition Millennium Falcon set by 20%. It's currently priced at $68, down from $85. This is the lowest we have seen it drop in a long while, but as you'd expect, the offer is only around for a short time. Grab it before it's too late!

See at Amazon

This set is part of a collectible series featuring mid-scale buildable models of iconic Star Wars starships, and comes together in 921 pieces. It's not going to be one of those quick projects you can finish in a few hours, but it's also not so overwhelming that it requires a full week of attention. It can be a fun weekend project where you rewatch a favorite movie from the series while building the ship.

Attention to detail here is seriously impressive. You'll build the cockpit, big rear engine, cannons, and even the satellite dish. It also includes a LEGO Star Wars 25th anniversary brick to celebrate the event. Once complete, the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy measures over 5 in. (13 cm) high, 9.5 in. (24 cm) long and 7.5 in. (19 cm) wide. It's designed to be displayed at a dynamic angle, as if it's in flight during a battle, or just carrying Luke Skywalker across the galaxy. Place it in your living room, or your office – it's going to turn heads regardless.

The set comes with a detailed instruction manual that takes you through each step of the building process. It's quite easy to follow for fans of all ages, but if you need more assistance, you can download the LEGO Builder app. The latter offers 3D instructions where you can zoom in on each step from every angle. You can also save progress and build with friends on the app. On a regular day, this LEGO set will cost you around $85, but you can now grab it for $68 at Amazon. That said, now is a great time to grab some other sets from the range to create a fuller, more complete setup, as we're spotting quite a few other options going for less, too.

Better watch out, Frore.

Move over, Frore, there's a new player in town. A research team comprising boffins from the Danish Technological Institute and the Heatflow company have come up with a 3D-printed cooler that can draw a whopping 600 W off a chip fully passively, without any pumps or fans, 3D Printing Industry reports. The design is naturally aimed at datacenters first and foremost, though one can imagine a world where variations on the design could work on desktop PCs and workstations.

Should the presented figures pan out, to say this cooler is impressive is quite the understatement. The original specification set an already-ambitious target of 400 W, a figure that was exceeded by a nice, round 50%.

Other than a presumably exquisite internal layout, this heatsink doesn't seem to have any special tricks. It's a standard two-phase thermosiphon, where coolant heats up and evaporates at the bottom, and condenses into vapor at the top, coming back down via gravity alone. The part shown in the picture is the heatsink that will connect to a radiator somewhere without any moving parts needed for the heat transfer.

The cooler's dissipation ability is impressive enough, but the liquid that goes out of it is claimed to be at 60 to 80°C, making it easy to recover and use in other heating networks for a double-whammy. The report claims these figures are superior to standard datacenter cooling that whisks away heat at lower temperatures, making it harder to reuse.

Seeing as the cooler is 3D printed, it has very little material wastage for production and only employs one material, making for efficient production and easy recycling. The underlying chip temperatures should also be lower than with conventional designs, helping with their longevity — a boon for AI accelerators that tend to live fast and die young, with exceedingly high failure rates.

The project's budget is arguably even more surprising than the end results. All it seemingly took was 10 million Danish Crowns (DKK), a figure that translates to $1.56 million, or 1.34 million euros. We do hope this technology makes its way to our gaming PCs... whenever we can afford RAM again.

But human-AI collaboration will likely lift certain industries to new levels.

Artificial intelligence is expected to reshape the labor market by eliminating white-collar positions that do not require a lot of creativity or experience, but at the same time increase demand for blue-collar employees like construction workers, electricians, or plumbers, as AI infrastructure requires a massive built-out, according to Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia. That build-out spans many industries, so while some roles will vanish, others will flourish, reports Bloomberg.

""This is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history that is going to create a lot of jobs,"" Huang said in a conversation with Laurence D. Fink, the head of BlackRock, at the World Economic Forum 2026. ""We are going to have plumbers, electricians, construction and steel workers, network technicians, and people who install and fit out the equipment. In the United States we are seeing quite a significant boom in [these areas]: salaries have gone up, nearly doubled. We are talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building uh chip factories or computer factories or AI factories. We have a great shortage in that.""

However, the benefits of AI-driven growth are unevenly distributed across the labor market. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei once warned that AI-enabled automation could trigger a 'white-collar bloodbath,' which could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level office jobs. He noted that Anthropic's Claude AI has become particularly great at coding tasks, which could displace junior software developers and even erode portions of more senior software engineering work.

Still, even Amodei believes the long-term gains from AI will outweigh the damage. Nonetheless, he warns that large-scale unemployment or underemployment remains a serious risk over the next five years.

By contrast, Huang argues that some professions that can greatly benefit from both AI and human touch will actually increase demand for certain specialists, which will lift certain industries to new heights.

""Ten years ago, one of the first professions that everybody thought was going to get wiped out was radiology,"" Huang noted. ""The reason for that was that the first thing AI [gpy] superhuman in capability was computer vision, and one of the largest applications of computer vision is studying scans by radiologists. Well, 10 years later, it is true that AI has now completely permeated and diffused into every aspect of radiology. It is true that radiologists use AI to study scans. […] However, […] the number of radiologists have gone up. Is that because a lack of trust of or is that because the human interaction with the results of AI is a better outcome? […] The fact that they are able to study scans now infinitely fast allows them to spend more time with patients diagnosing their disease, interacting with the patients, interacting with other clinicians. […] As a result of that, the number of patients that the hospital can see has gone up, [driving revenues of hospitals].""

In short, while AI can be a disaster for certain industries and professions, its impact on the quality of life will likely be comparable to the impact of electricity, automobiles, computers, broadband Internet, and telecommunications, all of which created many more professions and employment opportunities than they eliminated. However, one should note that the impact of AI can be compared to the cumulative impact of the aforementioned technologies combined in a very short time, so making exact predictions here is hardly a good business.

Ban shipments of H200 and MI325X to China, say U.S. lawmakers.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Legislators from the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee this week advanced the AI Overwatch Act, originally introduced in December, which would give ultimate control over the exports of high-performance data center-grade AI processors to adversary nations to Congress. As reported by Reuters, the bill advanced after the White House introduced its new export rules for fairly advanced AI GPUs from AMD and Nvidia to China, along with a mechanism to get a 25% fee from the exporters.

The AI Overwatch Act belongs to the same legislative family as the SAFE Chips Act introduced in early December, designed to curb shipments of advanced AI processors to adversary nations, such as China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, but it does so in a different way. The new bill codifies existing performance limitations that allow AMD and Nvidia to ship their H20 and MI308 processors to entities in adversary nations that are not specifically blacklisted by the U.S. government without an export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security. However, everything that offers higher performance would not only be subjected to export controls by the DoC but would also require approvals from Congress, which would have veto power, under the new proposals.

Essentially, if the bill becomes the law, then the U.S. Congress will be able to ban sales of AMD's Instinct MI325X and Nvidia's H200 processors to any Chinese customer, even if the executive branch explicitly allowed them. In addition, if passed, the legislation will terminate existing licenses, impose a temporary blanket denial until a new national security strategy is submitted, and subject any future approvals to 30-day congressional review.

One interesting thing that the bill introduces is that under the AI Overwatch Act, a trusted U.S. person may deploy and operate advanced, otherwise restricted AI GPUs abroad without certain export licenses, provided the hardware remains under U.S. ownership and control, is not placed in a country of concern, and meets strict security, ownership, and audit requirements. In effect, the framework allows the U.S. to export AI capability as a service to allies and partners while keeping physical control of the most powerful processors in American ownership.

For now, AMD, Nvidia, and others can sell high-end AI accelerators and servers to all countries except countries of concern without any restrictions. That is set to continue with the AI Overwatch. However, the trusted U.S. person framework is meant to governs ongoing control of AI compute beyond a one-time legal sale. If the bill becomes the law, it will ensure that even when allies access top-tier AI capability, ownership, oversight, and strategic leverage remain permanently with the United States.

""Companies like Nvidia are requesting to sell millions of advanced AI chips, which are the cutting edge of warfare, to Chinese military companies like Alibaba and Tencent,"" said Brian Mast, the chair the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee These are the same companies that work to spy against the United States of America, companies that the Chinese Communist Party uses to try and defeat the United States. This bill is very simple. It keeps America's advanced AI chips out of the hands of Chinese commie spies.""

They have got to get those chips.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Chinese companies are reportedly considering purchasing Nvidia's H200 AI GPUs from the black market after Beijing banned their import several days ago. According to a report by the South China Morning Post (SCMP), Chinese tech companies are faced with either paying more for the GPUs that have been imported illegally into the country or settling for less powerful, domestically made chips.

According to the report, three people familiar with the matter say Chinese customs officials are holding H200 chips at the border. The report says H200 orders are purportedly ""super sensitive,"" and that it is ""unclear when authorities would approve the imports."" As such, buyers are reportedly considering getting the GPUs from the black market instead because of ""urgent need."" According to SCMP, resellers are receiving inquiries for the H200, with bundled servers (featuring eight H200 chips) valued at 50 per cent more than their official China list price.

President Donald Trump approved the export of Nvidia's H200 GPUs in December 2025, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saying that there is strong customer demand for the chips in China. However, Beijing held an emergency meeting soon after the announcement to discuss the purchase of these AI processors. Earlier this year, the central government instructed its tech companies to pause the purchase of the H200, with some sources suggesting that only university R&D labs could acquire them.

Beijing is facing a dilemma, as it wants to pivot its dependence on Western-made chips and achieve “silicon sovereignty” by supporting its homegrown semiconductor industry. However, it's also locked in a race with the United States for AI supremacy, and its tech companies need the latest chips they can get their hands on for training the most advanced models.

The Chinese government claims that its homegrown AI processors can now match Nvidia H20 and RTX Pro 6000D in terms of performance, which is useful for AI inferencing. However, the domestic semiconductor industry still hasn't produced a chip that can match the H200 AI GPU, much less the newer and more powerful Blackwell processors, and the upcoming Vera Rubin, which Nvidia launched at CES 2026 and is expected to arrive in the second half of the year.

Because of this, some companies are reportedly turning to the black market to acquire the most powerful GPUs outside of regular, legal channels. Despite the U.S. ban on advanced Nvidia chips, China hasn't disallowed the sales of these advanced AI GPUs until recently. Because of this, there have been reports that Chinese companies have smuggled at least a billion dollars' worth of Nvidia AI chips in 2025, with some importers flaunting the availability of Blackwell B300 well before its launch.

However, Beijing's recent command means that illicitly acquiring H200 chips has become riskier. This meant that prices for the underground H200 servers, which come with eight GPUs, are priced at around $330,000, according to SCMP — a 50% premium over the MSRP that Nvidia has set for China. Furthermore, availability is spotty due to the increased scrutiny by Chinese customs.

At the moment, it's still uncertain whether Beijing's ban on the H200 is a permanent directive or just a temporary measure to get more out of negotiations with the U.S., especially as President Trump is set to visit Beijing in April. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is also set to visit China in late January, although it's not yet known if he will get to meet senior Chinese officials to talk about the H200 situation.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the proliferation of mature but dysfunctional B lymphocytes. It is a common adult leukemia.

Younger patients (eg, 30 years of age) can be impacted by CLL, but the median diagnostic age is 70 years. There is a slightly higher incidence of CLL in male populations than in female populations. However, female patients can have more aggressive disease. CLL incidence is relatively lower in Asia when compared with Western countries, and the majority of CLL patients are White.

Learn more about CLL.

CLL has a strong familial risk; data indicate there is an eightfold increased risk for CLL in relatives of patients with the disease. It has been reported that up to 10% of patients with CLL have a first-degree relative with CLL. Other risk factors include occupational exposure to certain chemicals (eg, benzene and heavy solvents), radiation exposure, tobacco use, and exposure to Agent Orange or other herbicides during military service; living or working in an urban environment is not considered the most common risk factor. 

Although MBL is a precursor of CLL, only a small percentage of patients with MBL will develop CLL. 

Learn more about CLL risk factors.

Even though the majority (about 80%) of patients with CLL are asymptomatic at diagnosis, most will have lymphadenopathy on examination.

Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly are less common, comparatively. Patients with CLL can present with skin lesions, with researchers stating they are the “most common nonlymphoid tissue involved in patients with CLL.” B symptoms (eg, unexplained fever, unintentional weight loss, and night sweats) can occur, but they are not usually as present as lymphadenopathy at diagnosis.

Learn more about CLL presentation.

A typical diagnosis of CLL is made when the complete blood cell count with differential shows absolute lymphocytosis with > 5000 B lymphocytes/µL, which persists for at least 3 months; clonality must be verified by flow cytometry as well.

In patients with < 5000 B lymphocytes/µL with lymphadenopathy and without cytopenias, small lymphocytic lymphoma is more likely.

A clonal B-lymphocyte population < 5000 cells/µL and no other signs of a lympho-myeloproliferative disorder is usually indicative of MBL.

Learn more about CLL diagnosis.

Selection of therapy in the initial setting is usually dependent on the stage of disease, presence of symptoms, patient fitness, and the presence of high-risk features (such as 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation).

The presence of 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation is associated with worse prognosis. Chemoimmunotherapy is usually not the most appropriate treatment options for these patients owing to low response rates. In this case, treatment options include BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors, hematopoietic cell transplant, and clinical trials; further, BTK inhibitors are not only recommended for relapsed or refractory disease; they can be used in initial settings as well. 

BCL-2 inhibitors (alone or in combination with other treatments) can be used in various treatment lines for CLL, such as the initial setting if a patient is intolerant to BTK inhibitors and in patients with relapsed or refractory disease.

 January 22, 2026  

In December 2025, Annals of Internal Medicine and the American College of Physicians held a panel discussion on health-related misinformation and disinformation. The panelists, physicians with expertise in clinical care as well as communication, were tasked with discussing strategies to use with patients who express misinformed views and make decisions about their health based on those viewpoints.

“The most powerful current threat to public health is not an infectious disease or climate change,” wrote Christine Laine, MD, MPH, editor-in-chief of Annals of Internal Medicine, and coauthors in an editorial commenting on the panel discussion. Rather, “it is the rampant spread of health-related misinformation and disinformation.”

Laine, a professor of medicine in the Division of Internal Medicine, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, told Medscape Medical News that although there are many definitions, “misinformation” tends not to be intentional, unlike “disinformation.” 

Darilyn Moyer, MD, executive vice president and chief executive officer, American College of Physicians, noted that health-related misinformation and disinformation aren't new, “Smallpox was one of the deadliest infectious diseases in human history. When the vaccine was first developed by Edward Jenner, who was inoculating people with cowpox because it was noted that milkmaids were protected from getting smallpox — many people were told they would turn into cows if they got the vaccine,” she told Medscape Medical News. Today, social media has “accelerated the emotional contagion of false information — especially during COVID.”

Addressing this problem goes beyond presenting accurate information, said Moyer, an adjunct clinical professor of medicine, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, who moderated the program. “It's a matter of heart and mind —meaning, you can't overwhelm people with data. You need to speak from the heart.”

The panel consisted of three experts: Helen Burstin, MD, MPH, a general internal medicine physician and the chief executive officer of the Council of Medical Specialty Societies; Kimberly Manning, MD, a general internal medicine physician in the Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, and vice chair of Community Engagement; and Megan Ranney, MD, MPH, an emergency physician, researcher, and dean of the independent Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut. Ranney is also a professor of public health and a professor of emergency medicine at Yale.

The discussion focused on three vignettes.

Manning recommended dealing with these patients by first “checking your biases.” And if you work in an environment where your patients have limited health literacy “you can ask yourself, what if some piece of what the patient is saying is right?”

The more open a physician can be to the patient's lived experiences, and those of the patient's family, friends, and culture, the more helpful the physician will be in attempting to bring a different perspective to the patient.

Manning also suggested investigating one's own feelings when accused of not being up to date on recent data. Do you feel hurt, frustrated, or defensive? “I check in with me,” she said. “I have to make sure I'm in the right space to answer the [patient's] question.”

“I make sure I sit down, slow my actions and not feel rushed, which the patient might see as passive-aggressive, patronizing, indifferent, or paternalistic. This makes people feel bad and can destroy the [therapeutic] alliance — particularly in vulnerable populations.”

Manning suggested acknowledging the patient's self-advocacy — for example by affirming that the patient in vignette 1 is advocating for themselves around vaccines. This leaves the door open for further engagement.

Asking open-ended questions is a good starting point, according to Burstin. “Listening is caring, so don't close the conversation.” Appreciating that the patient's openness is a “gift” further facilitates the conversation. “This replaces judgment with connection,” she said.

She also recommended echoing back what you've heard the patient say, asking permission to share information, and looking at resources the patient might bring to your attention. This approach removes pressure and shows respect.

The panelists noted that the clinical setting and the duration of the physician-patient relationship are relevant. In vignette 1, the physician has an established relationship with the patient. “Chances are that this patient might know that I have two sons in college, just as I know how many grandkids she has, and she might know that I went to a Beyonce concert,” Manning said.

She recommends “leaning into that lived experience, if it feels comfortable.” That type of rapport can lead to a different type of sharing when you present data supporting vaccines. “It might be reasonable for me to tell her about my mother receiving these vaccines. I can then say, ‘If this was your mama, and she read what I read, what would you tell her?'” When you share your own experience, your recommendations often resonate with patients.

Manning acknowledged that disclosing information about your life or health with a patient is a “very personal decision” that depends on the patient and the physician's comfort level. But even without personal sharing, knowing the patient can help inform the conversation so it speaks to the patient's life circumstances, goals, and values.

By contrast, vignette 2 occurred in the emergency department, where the physician had no prior relationship with the patient. Personal sharing may be appropriate in this setting too and may be part of “creating a human connection,” Ranney said. For example, she might tell the pregnant patient that she's also a mother who remembers the questions and fears she had during own pregnancy.

After a bond has been established, try to understand the patient's goal: is she here to obtain headache relief or to be reassured that the headache doesn't pose a serious threat to her pregnancy? Once that's been clarified and you've determined that the headache really is her typical migraine, you can offer her choices that are safe for pregnancy and present data. For example, although some data suggest an association between acetaminophen use and autism, association is not causation. The conditions that cause fever or pain (which are the reasons people take acetaminophen to begin with) can also cause fetal anomalies.

Ranney reminded listeners to “document the discussion, since unfortunately, no one can ever guarantee that a pregnancy will be normal, and it's important to keep medical malpractice in mind.”

The panel also recommended advising the patient to follow up with her obstetrician or neurologist and providing some reliable sources for the patient to obtain evidence-based information.

Moyer cautioned against using the word “misinformation” when speaking to patients, because some may perceive it as a way to categorize them negatively.

The panelists agreed. Ranney said patients may feel the physician is implying they “aren't smart enough to know what's real and what isn't.” Instead, try to determine why a particular point of view has salience to the patient. “Don't get into a face-to-face, full-on argument with a patient, family member, or member of the public,” she emphasized.

Moreover, the word “misinformation” may imply that the physician is “certain,” when scientific knowledge is continually evolving. Burstin said, “Some patients may see this as inconsistent, but it's crucial to explain to them that this is actually a good thing.”

She added that when addressing the statin-resistant patient in vignette 3, “there's so much to congratulate him on — he quit smoking, he lowered his alcohol, he exercises and has done almost everything right.” His success is a good place to start the statin conversation.

Motivational interviewing can be a helpful strategy in “debunking” patients' misconceptions and in fact is a cornerstone of communication in clinical care, Burstin said. This process involves asking why the patient is choosing to follow a path that differs from the one the physician is recommending while acknowledging the patient's beliefs and then sharing evidence that supports the physician's advice, if the patient is receptive.

One important aspect of debunking misinformation, according to Burstin, is explaining to the patient that many sources of health-related information are unreliable. For example, artificial intelligence is often inaccurate. Some entities may intentionally mislead the public for financial gain, disseminating false claims about products. Helping to cultivate curiosity and even sow seeds of doubt about current beliefs may set the stage for the patient to be more open to receiving information from reliable sources.

The panelists acknowledged that dealing with misinformation is often hampered by time constraints. The strategies “sound lovely in this idealistic hour-and-a-half webinar,” but in real-word clinical settings, there may be insufficient time for more than a brief intervention, Ranney said.

For this reason, “you have to choose your battles.” For example, she said, you may not be able to address a patient's reluctance to have three vaccinations, but perhaps you can focus on one. “And if all you can do is understand why they don't want the vaccine, but you succeed in keeping the relationship [with the patient], that's also a win.”

None of the planners or faculty reported having relevant financial relationships to disclose with ineligible companies whose primary business is producing, marketing, selling, re-selling, or distributing healthcare products used by or on patients.

Despite years of guidelines cautioning against their use, potentially inappropriate central nervous system (CNS)-active medications are commonly prescribed to older adults —particularly those with cognitive impairment — highlighting persistent gaps in medication safety and substantial opportunities for deprescribing in routine clinical practice.

Investigators found that 1 in 4 Medicare recipients with dementia are prescribed these high-risk medications, and over two thirds of these prescriptions lacked a documented clinical indication.

The findings indicate “high levels of potentially inappropriate and harmful prescribing,” senior study investigator John N. Mafi, MD, Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, said in a press release.

However, the overall number of seniors receiving these prescriptions has fallen over time, a trend Mafi said was encouraging.

The findings were published online on January 12 in JAMA.

For decades, clinical guidelines have warned against high-risk CNS-active medications due to their association with delirium, falls, and hospitalization — risks that are especially pronounced in older adults with cognitive impairment.

To assess whether long-standing guideline warnings have translated into meaningful changes in real-world prescribing and to identify opportunities to reduce medication-related harm, the researchers used Medicare fee-for-service claims from 2013 to 2021 in 4842 adults aged 65 years or older with normal cognition, cognitive impairment with no dementia (CIND), or dementia.

The researchers assessed the proportion of beneficiaries receiving one or more potentially inappropriate CNS-active prescriptions with a supply of at least 28 days, categorized into five drug classes: antidepressants with strong anticholinergic properties, antipsychotics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics.

After adjusting for age, sex, race and ethnicity, cognition, comorbidities, and socioeconomic status, the results showed 19.9% (95% CI,18.1%-21.6%) of beneficiaries received one or more potentially inappropriate CNS-active prescriptions in 2013, which decreased to 16.2% (95% CI, 14.3%-18.1%) in 2021 — a decline of 3.7 percentage points (P = .003).

When prescribing trends were examined by drug class from 2013 to 2021, benzodiazepine use declined from 11.4% (95% CI, 10.0%-12.8%) to 9.1% (95% CI, 7.6%-10.5%; P = .02), while nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic use fell more sharply from 7.4% (95% CI, 6.2%-8.6%) to 2.9% (95% CI, 2.1%-3.8%; P < .001). 

In contrast, there were no significant changes in prescribing rates for antipsychotics (2.6% [95% CI, 1.9%-3.3%] to 3.6% [95% CI, 2.7%-4.6%]; P = .07) or barbiturates (0.4% [95% CI, 0.06%-0.6%] to 0.3% [95% CI, 0.03%-0.5%]; P = .40).

Rates remained particularly concerning among patients with cognitive impairment. Compared with beneficiaries with normal cognition (17.0%; 95% CI, 15.6%-18.3%), those with CIND were significantly more likely to receive potentially inappropriate CNS-active prescriptions (21.7%; 95% CI, 19.3%-24.2%; P < .001), as were beneficiaries with dementia (25.1%; 95% CI, 21.4%-28.9%; P < .001).

Patients with cognitive impairment face a higher risk of having adverse effects from these drugs. “These results underscore substantial opportunities to improve the quality and safety of care for millions of older Americans,” said Mafi.

The proportion of prescriptions with a documented clinical indication did not differ significantly between 2013 (6.0%) and 2021 (5.5%).

However, among the 16.2% of beneficiaries receiving potentially inappropriate CNS-active prescriptions in 2021, 11.4% (70.4%) lacked clinical indications.

The authors noted several limitations. Medicare Advantage data were unavailable, clinical information may have been incomplete, and the analysis focused on prescribing prevalence rather than cumulative medication exposure.

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging. The investigators reported no relevant financial disclosures.

Among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), microbial diversity was lowest in those with Crohn's disease, where coffee and whole wheat bread intake was linked to reduced disease activity status via mediation by specific bacteria and metabolites. In those with ulcerative colitis, fruit and coffee intake was linked to lower C-reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin levels by enhancing microbial richness.

“These findings highlight a coherent mechanistic route whereby diet influences inflammation through modulation of microbial [short-chain fatty acid] production and related metabolic functions,” the authors wrote. “From a translational perspective, our results provide mechanistic support for dietary interventions as adjuncts to medical therapy in IBD.”

The study was led by Luis Mayorga, Microbiome Lab, Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca, Barcelona, Spain. It was published online in Gut.

Reliance on self-reported dietary questionnaires may resulted in misclassification of dietary intake. Further analysis is needed to confirm these mediations in controlled dietary intervention trials and independent IBD cohorts.

This study was supported by grants from the Instituto de Salud Carlos III and co-funded by the European Union, the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, FEDER (EU), and the AGAUR. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

In patients with HNF1A-related maturity-onset diabetes of the young (HNF1A-MODY), 4 weeks of treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, along with other glucose-lowering therapies, improved glycaemic control without a significant increase in hypoglycaemia or other adverse events.

""Together with published case reports, this study supports that SGLT2 inhibitors have a clinically relevant glucose-lowering effect in individuals with HNF1A-MODY despite the potentially reduced expression of SGLT2 and that empagliflozin could be used as a second-line and/or third-line agent,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Henrik Maagensen, Copenhagen University Hospital - Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was published online on January 12, 2026, in Diabetes Care.

The short study duration and small cohort limited a thorough assessment of safety and long-term benefit. The low number of hypoglycaemia episodes likely left the study underpowered to detect differences between the two groups. The study was not designed as a treat-to-target trial with insulin and sulfonylurea titration, limiting the investigation of hypoglycaemia prevention through medication adjustment.

This study was indirectly supported by the Novo Nordisk Foundation through unrestricted grants to Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen. Some authors reported receiving research support, serving on advisory boards, participating in speakers bureaus, owning stocks, or receiving travel reimbursements from multiple pharmaceutical companies, including Novo Nordisk.

Nivolumab plus ipilimumab (NIPO + IPI) showed sustained survival benefit vs lenvatinib or sorafenib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with 4-year overall survival rates of 31% vs 18%.

“After 4 years of follow-up, first-line NIVO + IPI continued to show sustained efficacy benefit vs lenvatinib/sorafenib in unresectable HCC and manageable safety with no new concerns,” the study authors reported. “These results continue to support NIVO + IPI as a standard-of-care treatment in these patients.”

The study, led by Peter R. Galle, MD, PhD, University Medical Center in Mainz, Germany, was presented at the ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium 2026.

Crohn's disease is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory process of the gastrointestinal tract that can affect any part from the mouth to the anus. The disease displays a bimodal age distribution, with incidence peaking between ages 15 and 30 years and again between 40 and 60 years, though it can occur at any age. Environmental and microbial factors, including smoking and changes in the gut microbiome, are implicated in disease onset and flares.

Most patients with Crohn's disease present initially with an inflammatory (non-stricturing, non-penetrating) phenotype, but disease behavior often evolves over time. Contemporary analyses indicate that roughly 50% of patients develop a stricturing or penetrating phenotype and that approximately 50% of individuals experience at least one structural complication (eg, stricture, fistula, abscess, or phlegmon) during long-term follow-up.

Learn more about the presentation of Crohn's disease.

Endoscopic evaluation with biopsy is generally recommended for patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease. This method is often used to differentiate among Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and noninflammatory types of gastrointestinal tract disorders. Results that typically point to Crohn's disease include focal crypt irregularity and transmural lymphoid aggregates.

Stool testing can be performed in the course of workup to aid diagnosis, encompassing fecal pathogens, Clostridioides difficile testing, and studies that identify gut inflammation; fecal calprotectin should be considered to help differentiate the presence of inflammatory bowel disease from irritable bowel syndrome.

Laboratory evaluation and stool testing are not used to definitively diagnose Crohn's disease or differentiate it from ulcerative colitis. However, no single laboratory test can establish the diagnosis of Crohn's disease or reliably distinguish it from ulcerative colitis. Genetic testing is not indicated to establish the diagnosis of Crohn's disease or differentiate it from ulcerative colitis and is mostly reserved for research settings.

Learn more about approach considerations for Crohn's disease.

Small bowel imaging is an essential component of the diagnostic evaluation in patients with suspected Crohn's disease, particularly when ileal or proximal small bowel involvement is suspected or cannot be visualized via ileocolonoscopy. Imaging is not limited to cases of ileitis; it is also valuable for assessing occult bleeding, strictures, obstruction, penetrating complications, and transmural disease activity.

Current guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) recommend the use of cross-sectional imaging, either MRE or CTE, to evaluate small bowel Crohn's disease. MRE is preferred when feasible because it avoids ionizing radiation.

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is not routinely performed in all patients with Crohn's disease. It is primarily indicated in those with upper gastrointestinal symptoms or as part of a diagnostic workup in children.

Learn more about imaging for Crohn's disease.

The ACG recommends early introduction of biologic or small molecule therapy rather than a pure step-up strategy in adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, particularly for those with high-risk features. Thiopurines are not appropriate for induction because of delayed onset of action. Corticosteroids are effective for short-term induction but are not recommended for maintenance. There is no firm recommendation to routinely withdraw immunomodulator or biologic therapy in patients on combination treatment who are in remission. Therapy should follow a treat-to-target strategy emphasizing mucosal healing and objective monitoring.

Learn more about biologic therapy for Crohn's disease.

The American Gastroenterological Association recommends proactive disease monitoring in patients with Crohn' disease who are in symptomatic remission, using a combination of clinical symptoms and objective biomarkers such as fecal calprotectin and CRP. In patients with recent endoscopic confirmation of remission and on stable therapy without new symptoms, a fecal calprotectin level < 150 μg/g and/or a CRP < 5 mg/L is suggested as a threshold to rule out active inflammation. When these criteria are met, routine endoscopic reassessment may be deferred, which can reduce unnecessary procedures.

Chemotherapy commonly damages the intestinal lining, a well-known side effect. But this injury does not remain confined to the gut. It reshapes nutrient availability for intestinal bacteria, forcing the microbiota to adapt.

The researchers report that chemotherapy-induced damage to the intestinal lining alters nutrient availability for gut bacteria, reshaping the microbiota and increasing the production of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), a tryptophan-derived microbial metabolite.

Rather than acting locally, IPA functions as a systemic messenger. It travels from the gut to the bone marrow, where it rewires immune cell production. Elevated IPA levels reprogram myelopoiesis, reducing the generation of immunosuppressive monocytes that facilitate immune evasion and metastatic growth.

We were surprised by how a side effect often seen as collateral damage of chemotherapy can trigger such a structured systemic response. By reshaping the gut microbiota, chemotherapy sets off a cascade of events that rewires immunity and makes the body less permissive to metastasis."" 

Ludivine Bersier, first author of the study

This immune reconfiguration enhances T-cell activity and remodels immune interactions within metastatic niches, particularly in the liver, resulting in a metastasis-refractory state in preclinical models.

Experimental findings are mirrored in patients. Clinical relevance is supported by patient data obtained in collaboration with Dr Thibaud Koessler (Geneva University Hospitals, HUG). In patients with colorectal cancer, higher circulating IPA levels following chemotherapy are associated with reduced monocyte levels, a feature of improved survival outcomes.

""This work shows that the effects of chemotherapy extend far beyond the tumor itself. By uncovering a functional axis linking the gut, the bone marrow and metastatic sites, we highlight systemic mechanisms that could be harnessed to durably limit metastatic progression."" says Tatiana Petrova, corresponding author of the study.

This research was supported by multiple funders, including the Swiss National Science Foundation and Swiss Cancer League. An ISREC Foundation Tandem Grant supported close collaboration between clinical and fundamental research, led at Unil by Professor Tatiana Petrova and Dr Thibaud Koessler at HUG. The project posits that chemotherapy can induce a form of biological ""memory"", mediated by gut microbiome–derived metabolites that durably inhibit metastatic growth.

Together, these findings reveal a previously underappreciated gut–bone marrow–liver metastasis axis through which chemotherapy can exert durable systemic effects, opening new avenues to harness microbiota-derived metabolites as adjuvant strategies to limit metastasis.

One of the world's most extensive birth cohorts is now entering later adulthood. At the University of Oulu in Finland, the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966) is launching a major new follow-up combining decades of biological, social, and environmental data with modern digital health tools to examine how lifelong exposures and the genome shape health and aging.

Established in 1965–1966, NFBC1966 has followed individuals from before birth – beginning during their mothers' pregnancies – through childhood and adulthood and now into later life. This is a long-term follow-up study with exceptionally comprehensive life course data, spanning more than six decades. Few studies globally combine such long follow-up with biological samples, clinical examinations, survey data, national health registers, and now also digital health measurements.

Finland offers a uniquely valuable setting for long-term population research due to its relatively homogeneous population, comprehensive healthcare registers, and high-quality longitudinal data, enabling accurate tracking of health and social outcomes over time.

During its long history, the NFBC1966 study has demonstrated how health is shaped by a complex interplay of social, environmental, biological, and behavioural factors across the life course. Now, as participants reach 60 years of age, the study is broadening its focus on understanding aging, its early signs, and how early-life conditions predict health in later life. Approximately 9,800 cohort members (alive and living in Finland) have been invited to participate in the current follow-up.

Population aging is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century in the Western world. In Finland, the proportion of people aged over 75 is expected to double within the next 25 years, a trend mirrored across Europe and many other regions.

Professor Sylvain Sebert, Scientific Director of the NFBC1966 study, emphasizes that aging is a natural and continuous process. aging is not a disease, nor is it synonymous with decline – it does not begin at a specific age. Healthy aging, he notes, can be supported throughout life and should be understood as a fundamental human right.

By drawing on decades of cohort data, the NFBC1966 study aims to identify factors that promote resilience and reduce the risk of chronic disease. These findings can inform prevention strategies, healthcare planning, and health policy – both in Finland and internationally – such as improving early prevention of multi-morbidity, supporting functional capacity in later life, and guiding more sustainable healthcare systems.

Around the age of 60, it appears that humans are reaching a cornerstone point where many aging-related processes begin to emerge. It is essential to collect detailed information before these changes fully take hold, as many chronic conditions – such as cancers, dementia and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and kidney diseases – become more common at this stage. Studying people before these changes fully emerge is essential if we want to understand how healthy aging can be supported from both a personal and healthcare system perspective.”

Professor Sylvain Sebert, Scientific Director of the NFBC1966 study

The 2026 follow-up, part of the STAGE-project, builds on traditional clinical assessments by integrating the latest health technologies, including hip-worn activity trackers, Oura rings, mobile applications, and possible 24/7 physiological measurements. These tools enable continuous, objective monitoring of daily functioning, physical activity, sleep, and recovery – capturing aspects of health that clinical visits alone cannot.

“We are contributing to the understanding of the digital transformation of healthcare. Combining clinical visits with digital tools gives us a much fuller picture of health across the life course”, Professor Sebert says.

A key perspective is to advance the inclusive integration of digital health solutions that support health without increasing social or economic inequalities. By providing these technologies to participants, NFBC1966 offers a model for how digital tools can be integrated into healthcare systems inclusively.

As NFBC1966 enters its seventh decade, it is increasingly shaped by international and multidisciplinary collaboration. An extensive network of research groups is working with the data to study aging, genetics, metabolism, cognition, and the environmental and social determinants of health, under strict ethical and data-protection standards. The unique longitudinal design of NFBC1966 provides researchers worldwide with valuable insights into how health, aging, and their determinants evolve across the life course.

Even a short afternoon nap can help the brain recover and improve its ability to learn. In a study published on January 22, 2026, in the journal NeuroImage, researchers at the Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and University of Geneva, show that even a nap is enough to reorganize connections between nerve cells so that new information can be stored more effectively. Until now, these effects were only known to occur after a full night's sleep. The new study shows that a short sleep period can relieve the brain and put it back into a state of readiness to learn - a process that could be particularly beneficial for situations with high work load.

""Our results suggest that even short periods of sleep enhance the brain's capacity to encode new information"" says study leader Prof. Christoph Nissen, who performed the study during his time as medical director of the sleep center at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany. Today, he is Chief-physician of the Division of psychiatric specialties and Director of the Sleep medicine center (HUG), and Full Professor in the Department of psychiatry at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine

The brain is constantly active during the day: new impressions, thoughts, and information are processed, strengthening the connections between nerve cells (synapses). These strengthened synaptic connections are an important neural basis for learning processes. However, they also lead to saturation, so that the brain's ability to learn further decreases over time. Sleep helps to regulate this excessive activity again - without losing important information. ""The study shows that this 'synaptic reset' can happen with just an afternoon nap, clearing space for new memories to form."" says Prof Nissen.

The study helps us understand how important even short periods of sleep are for mental recovery. A short nap can help you think more clearly and continue working with concentration.""

Prof. Kai Spiegelhalder, head of the Section for Psychiatric Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medical Center Freiburg

The study examined 20 healthy young adults who either took a nap or stayed awake on two afternoons. The afternoon nap lasted on average 45 minutes. Since direct measurements on synapses in healthy humans are not possible, the research team used established, non-invasive methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and EEG measurements to draw conclusions about the strength and flexibility of the synapses.

The results showed that after the nap, the overall strength of synaptic connections in the brain was reduced - a sign of the restorative effect of sleep. At the same time, the brain's ability to form new connections was significantly improved. The brain was therefore better prepared for learning new content than after an equally long period of wakefulness.

The study provides a biological explanation for why people often perform better after an afternoon nap. Especially in professions or activities that require a high level of mental or physical performance - such as in music, sports, or safety-critical areas - a nap could be used to maintain performance. ""An afternoon nap can sustain performance under high demand,"" says Prof Nissen.

However, the researchers emphasize that occasional sleep problems do not automatically lead to a decline in performance. In chronic insomnia disorder in particular, sleep-wake regulatory systems are essentially intact; rather, worries and unfavorable sleep-wake behavior dominate. In such situations, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is more useful than sleeping pills, as the latter can disrupt the brain's natural recovery processes and lead to the development of dependence.

Overuse of antibiotics has accelerated the development of bacterial resistance to conventional drugs, a global health crisis projected to result in more than 10 million deaths annually by 2050. The multidrug-resistant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounts for approximately one-fifth of hospital-acquired pneumonia cases and is associated with severe illness and increased mortality.

Nitric oxide is a therapeutic gas that researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, helped establish as a life-saving therapy for hundreds of thousands of newborns with congenital heart disease. Nearly 30 years later, investigators from the same laboratory at Mass General Brigham report that high-dose inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) demonstrates potential antimicrobial activity in preclinical models and is safe and feasible in early human studies, supporting further clinical investigation. The findings are published in Science Translational Medicine.

This study provides a translational foundation rather than a definitive clinical solution. Our findings demonstrate strong preclinical antipseudomonal effects together with reassuring human safety data.""

Binglan Yu, PhD, first author, Mass General Brigham Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine

""These results justify the careful design of phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials to formally assess clinical efficacy,"" added co-first author Bijan Safaee Fakhr, MD, also of the MGB Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine.

In the study, researchers first demonstrated dose-dependent killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa using nitric oxide-releasing compounds in vitro. They then showed that pigs with experimental P. aeruginosa pneumonia treated with high-dose iNO (300 parts per million) exhibited reduced bacterial burden, along with improved oxygenation and other markers of lung infection, compared with untreated animals.

To assess feasibility and safety in humans, the investigators evaluated repeated high-dose iNO exposure in 10 healthy volunteers and two critically ill patients affected by multidrug-resistant bacterial infection. The treatment was well tolerated, with no serious safety concerns observed. A retrospective analysis of patients who received high-dose iNO in clinical settings, mostly during the COVID-19 pandemic, further supported the safety profile of this approach.

""These results suggest a promising strategy that could complement existing treatments,"" said senior author Lorenzo Berra, MD, of the MGB Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine. ""However, rigorous clinical trials are essential before this approach can be considered for routine clinical use.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study shows DHPS enzyme controls macrophage maturation across multiple organs","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260121/Study-shows-DHPS-enzyme-controls-macrophage-maturation-across-multiple-organs.aspx","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 03:27:00 GMT","

A new study led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, its Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that an enzyme involved in protein translation is essential for circulating immune cells, called monocytes, to mature into tissue-resident macrophages, a specialized population of immune cells that maintain organ health by clearing dead cells and debris. Without this enzyme, monocytes enter tissues but fail to fully differentiate, leading to impaired tissue maintenance and persistent immune cell infiltration that causes inflammation instead of repair.

The research, funded in part by the National Institutes of Health and published Jan. 21 in Nature, showed that deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) is required for both the differentiation and long-term survival of macrophages across multiple organs, including the lung, liver, brain, kidney, heart and peritoneal cavity.

Using a series of mouse models, the investigators, led by Erika Pearce, Ph.D., Bloomberg Distinguished Professor in the Department of Oncology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, demonstrated that DHPS controls a core, tissue-agnostic program that enables macrophages to adhere to their local environment, interact with surrounding cells and carry out the essential functions that maintain tissue balance and organ health.

Tissue resident macrophages are critical for tissue homeostasis, such as clearing out dead cells, repairing damage and maintaining balance in organs. When these cells can't mature properly, these protective functions are lost, contributing to inflammation and disease.""

Erika Pearce, Ph.D., Bloomberg Distinguished Professor, Department of Oncology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

Tissue-resident macrophages form during embryonic development and typically self-renew locally. However, during injury or cell loss, bone-marrow-derived monocytes are recruited into tissues and must differentiate into mature macrophages to restore the normal, healthy population of macrophages. The study found that when DHPS was deleted in myeloid cells, macrophages were present in tissues but lacked the defining features and functions of mature tissue-resident macrophages.

Although monocytes were able to migrate into tissues and begin the differentiation process, without DHPS, they were unable to complete the transition to fully functional tissue-resident macrophages. As a result, tissue and organs experienced an ongoing influx of immature immune cells that failed to restore normal macrophage populations.

""The monocyte migration/infiltration was persistent but, ultimately, futile,"" explains Gustavo Carrizo, Ph.D., a former graduate student in the Pearce lab and first author on the study. ""They could enter tissues, but without DHPS they couldn't become the right kind of macrophage needed to maintain and repair those tissues.""

The researchers traced these defects to the polyamine–hypusine pathway. Analyses of gene activity, protein production and protein-making machinery revealed that DHPS is required for efficient translation of a subset of genes involved in cell adhesion (the ability to stick to their surroundings and to other cells so they can stay in the correct place and function properly), signaling, and tissue interaction. Without DHPS, macrophages failed to express key proteins needed to anchor themselves within tissues and respond appropriately to local cues.

Imaging studies showed that DHPS-deficient macrophages had abnormal shape and positioning within tissues, while functional assays demonstrated defects in the clearance of dead cells and tissue maintenance. In the lung, this impairment led to accumulation of surfactant material, a substance in the lungs that keeps air sacs open, and immune cell infiltration, while in the liver, acute macrophage depletion followed by failed restoration resulted in vascular disruption and tissue damage.

""Because tissue-resident macrophages play roles in cancer, wound healing, fibrosis and inflammatory diseases, this pathway could be relevant across a wide range of diseases, as well as in aging, where inflammation and impaired tissue repair are common,"" says Daniel Puleston, Ph.D., assistant professor of immunology and immunotherapy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and a co-senior author on the paper.

Together, the findings identify DHPS as a central, cell-intrinsic regulator of macrophage maturation that operates independently of tissue type. By linking metabolic control of protein translation to immune cell differentiation and tissue stability, the study provides a unifying mechanism for how monocytes become long-living, functional tissue-resident macrophages.

The authors note that understanding this pathway has implications for aging, inflammatory disease and therapies that aim to target macrophages across tissues, where restoring or modulating macrophage function could influence long-term tissue health. Next steps, they say, will focus on identifying the full set of DHPS-dependent proteins and determining how this pathway influences macrophage behavior in specific diseases, where promoting tissue repair or limiting inflammation may require different therapies.

""This is a very fundamental pathway for these cells,"" Pearce says. ""Understanding when and where macrophages depend on this process, and when it might be beneficial to enhance or inhibit, is an important next step.""

In addition to Carrizo, Puleston and Pearce, other researchers participating in the study are Pianpian Lin, Seung Hyun Lee, Kevin Shenderov, Camille Blerlot, Minsun Cha, Lena Schimmelpfennig, Zhen Shen, Nikki van Teijlingen Bakker, Katarzyna Grzes, Beth Kelly, Niloufar Safinia, Kate Schole, Yaarub Musa, Gerhard Mittler, Yoh Zen, Edward Pearce, Florent Ginhoux and David Sanin.

A newly revealed “aging cliff” in sperm RNA marks a conserved molecular transition from youth to later life, offering fresh insight into how a father's age may influence the earliest stages of development.

Study: Conserved shifts in sperm small non-coding RNA profiles during mouse and human aging. Image credit: WindNight/Shutterstock.com

A recent study in The EMBO Journal used a previously developed method, PANDORA-seq, to profile small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) in mouse and human spermatozoa across the lifespan, uncovering previously undetectable sncRNA species.

More men are becoming fathers later in life. Advanced paternal age reduces male fertility and increases health risks for children, including stillbirth, developmental disorders, and neuropsychiatric conditions. Animal studies have shown that offspring of older fathers are at higher risk of metabolic disorders, obesity, and anxiety.

Although the majority of studies on sperm aging have focused on DNA damage and methylation changes, scientists now recognize the epigenetic potential of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) in sperm, which play a crucial role in the intergenerational transmission of paternal environmental cues and may influence early embryonic development.

The sncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), and ribosomal RNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs), carry information about a father's age and experiences that may be transmitted to the next generation. They also serve as quality markers for embryos in fertility clinics, leading to the concept of a ‘sperm RNA code', which refers to specific RNA patterns in sperm that are proposed to influence offspring health through paternal factors.

Researchers applied PANDORA-seq, a sequencing method that reduces detection bias caused by RNA modifications missed by traditional techniques, enabling analysis of tsRNAs and rsRNAs with chemical modifications. This technique revealed that miRNAs comprise less than 0.5 % of detected small RNA reads, while tsRNAs and rsRNAs are dominant and play key roles in paternal epigenetic transmission.

Analyzing mouse sperm across five age groups (10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 weeks), researchers found a distinct ‘aging cliff' between 50 and 70 weeks, marked by a dramatic shift in tsRNA,rsRNA composition. This transition, which represents a population-level molecular shift rather than a single deterministic switch in individuals, separates early from late aging stages and was detectable only by PANDORA-seq. The tsRNA,rsRNA-based aging cliff showed stronger separation between early and late aging stages than the miRNA-based cliff, demonstrating PANDORA-seq's superior sensitivity in detecting age-related changes.

Since sperm head RNAs are thought to be more functionally relevant for embryo development than cytoplasmic RNAs, researchers analyzed isolated sperm heads across the same age groups. Both whole sperm and sperm heads revealed an aging cliff at the 50–70 week transition using PANDORA-seq, confirming this as a robust aging signature.

Sperm heads contained mitochondrial tsRNAs and rsRNAs (0.14 % and 0.11 %) that showed coordinated age-related changes, mirroring the genomic aging cliff. This finding strongly suggests, but does not directly demonstrate, mitochondria-to-nucleus RNA transport as a potential mechanism mediating aging signals.

An age-related rsRNA length shift in sperm heads was noted, with longer RNAs increasing while shorter ones decreased, particularly in 28S- and 18S-derived rsRNAs. Mitochondrial rsRNAs showed similar trends, however tsRNAs did not. This length shift is consistent with a model in which aged sperm have reduced rsRNA processing capacity, potentially due to oxidative stress altering enzyme activity, with possible implications for fertility and offspring health.

Researchers applied PANDORA-seq to human sperm from two cohorts: a longitudinal cohort of 8 donors sampled (ages 34–68), and a cross-sectional cohort of 47 donors (ages 25–51). Sperm heads were isolated to enrich aging signals and ensure RNA purity.

Both human cohorts revealed a consistent age-related shift in rsRNA length, mirroring mouse trends: longer rsRNAs increased, and shorter rsRNAs decreased. This shift was more prominent in total rsRNAs, specifically in 18S- and 28S-derived rsRNAs. Mitochondrial rsRNAs showed similar but weaker trends. These findings indicate that the rsRNA length shift is an evolutionarily conserved aging feature, which the authors propose may be linked to oxidative stress and altered enzymatic activity. Such changes may reshape the sperm RNA code and could impact embryo development and offspring health.

To test functional significance, researchers created RNA cocktails representing “young” and “old” sperm profiles using tsRNAs and rsRNAs with the most significant age-related expression changes. These cocktails were transfected into mouse embryonic stem cells, and gene expression was analyzed 24 hours later.

The old sperm RNA cocktail activated different genes than the young cocktail, particularly those involved in metabolism, mitochondrial function, and neurodegenerative diseases. These pathway changes align with biological processes implicated in health problems observed in offspring of older fathers, including metabolic and neurological disorders. This in vitro experiment demonstrates that age-related changes in sperm RNAs can directly alter gene activity in embryonic cells, providing proof-of-principle rather than direct evidence of in vivo inheritance or offspring phenotypes.

The authors also note that synthetic RNA cocktails may not fully recapitulate the biological activity of endogenous sperm RNAs, which naturally carry chemical modifications that can influence RNA stability and function.

Researchers used PANDORA-seq to discover an “aging cliff” in sperm, a sharp transition in small RNA patterns that occurs at a specific age in mice (50–70 weeks) and is reflected in conserved molecular features observed in human sperm. The current study found an age-related shift in rsRNA length: longer rsRNAs increase, while shorter ones decrease, with aging sperm.

This shift is proposed to reflect a reduced RNA processing capacity with age, potentially due to oxidative stress. Functional tests showed that RNA cocktails mimicking old sperm activated genes linked to metabolic disorders and neurological diseases in embryonic stem cells, supporting a model in which paternal age-associated changes in sperm RNA may influence early developmental gene regulation.

These conserved RNA signatures could serve as biomarkers for sperm quality in fertility clinics. They may, with further validation, inform future efforts to better understand paternal age-related reproductive and health risks.

Amid a surprisingly severe flu season and a Covid-19 resurgence, those highly contagious respiratory illnesses are drawing the largest share of media coverage and public attention. But it is also the season for another respiratory illness, respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, and RSV cases are ""elevated in many areas of the country,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

RSV data for the week of Jan. 5, 2026, show an increase both in emergency department visits and hospital admissions for children up to age four, according to CIDRAP, the Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy, at the University of Minnesota. And the Pan American Health Organization issued a Jan. 10 epidemiological alert warning RSV activity ""is showing a gradual upward trend,"" which, combined with flu cases, ""could further strain health systems.""

RSV, a common respiratory illness, usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but is the leading cause of hospitalization among infants in the United States. Most RSV infections go away on their own, but RSV can be severe, especially for babies, young children, and older adults. The CDC estimates that more than 100,000 older Americans are hospitalized annually with RSV, as well as 58,000 or more infants and young children. 

In mid-2023, U.S. health authorities approved two types of immunizations for RSV – vaccines for older adults and for pregnant people to protect their newborns; and a monoclonal antibody injection for newborns and infants.

In a nationally representative panel survey conducted Nov. 17-Dec. 1, 2025, the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC) of the University of Pennsylvania found an increase in awareness of immunizations that are available for RSV. The survey of 1,637 U.S. adults also found that about 6 in 10 respondents would recommend the vaccine or antibody injections to the groups recommended by the CDC, an increase from past years. 

The rises both in public familiarity with the RSV immunizations and recommending them come as U.S. health officials under longtime vaccine critic and Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cut the number of routinely recommended childhood vaccinations and increased scrutiny of vaccines long-established as safe and effective.

Beginning in 2023, the CDC recommended RSV immunization for newborns and infants – either through a maternal RSV vaccine given to those who are pregnant during their 32nd-36th weeks or through a monoclonal antibody injection given to newborns and infants born during RSV season, typically October through March.

On Jan. 5, 2026, after this survey was conducted, U.S. health authorities cut the number of regular childhood vaccinations to 11 from 17. As a non-vaccine antibody product, RSV immunization is not part of this count, although health officials presented it as a tool that was also now being reserved for high-risk groups. An HHS spokesman, however, told the Washington Post that these high-risk groups include all otherwise healthy children whose mothers were not vaccinated against RSV during pregnancy. This effectively means the RSV guidelines did not change for newborns: Either those who are pregnant should be vaccinated during their pregnancy or their infants should get the monoclonal antibody injection.

The CDC also recommends the antibody injection for certain young children (ages 8 to 19 months) who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease.

The CDC recommends RSV vaccination for adults 75 and older and people 50-74 years old who are at increased risk for severe RSV, if they did not get an RSV vaccine last year.

The survey finds different levels of familiarity with the immunizations for different groups, but all have increased from 2023 when the immunizations were first introduced:

The vaccine for older adults: The survey finds that a majority of adults (56%) are aware there is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccine against RSV for older adults, up from 42% in October 2023, only months after CDC first recommended this treatment, in May 2023. In 2025, 39% are unsure whether there is a vaccine, compared with 53% unsure in October 2023.

The maternal vaccine to protect newborns: The survey also finds greater familiarity with the RSV vaccine for pregnant people, as compared with an August 2023 survey, when the vaccine first became available. In the current survey, 38% say there is an FDA-approved vaccine against RSV for pregnant people to protect their infants, up from 12% in August 2023. However, the percentage familiar with this vaccine was eight points higher in September 2024 at 46%, so the current figure represents a recent decline.

A majority of Americans say they would be likely to recommend the RSV vaccine for older adults and those who are pregnant and the monoclonal antibody injection for infants, as the CDC has recommended:

It's encouraging to see the increase in the likelihood of recommending the RSV vaccine to people who are pregnant or the monoclonal antibody to parents of newborns and infants. It's important for OB-GYNs, pediatricians, and public health officials to communicate the value of these immunizations.""

Ken Winneg, managing director of survey research at APPC

Most U.S. adults say that getting the RSV vaccine is safer than getting RSV:

The survey data come from the 26th wave of a nationally representative panel of U.S. adults conducted for the Annenberg Public Policy Center by SSRS, an independent market research company. Wave 26 (n=1,637) of the Annenberg Science and Public Health Knowledge (ASAPH) survey was fielded Nov. 17-Dec. 1, 2025, and has a margin of sampling error (MOE) of ± 3.5 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. Figures are rounded to the nearest whole number and may not add to 100%. Combined subcategories may not add to totals in the topline and text due to rounding.

Smartwatches with both PPG and ECG functionality improve the detection of atrial fibrillation in comparison with standard care. Researchers from Amsterdam UMC analysed the data from 437 patients and detected heart arrythmia four times more often in those who wore an Apple Watch. These results are published today in JACC (Journal of the American College of Cardiology).  

Traditionally, monitoring takes place with other ECG devices, but patients can find them a bit irritating, and most of them can only monitor for two weeks at a time.""

Michiel Winter, cardiologist, Amsterdam UMC

Atrial fibrillation is the arrhythmia associated with stroke. Irregular atrial beating can lead to the formation of clots. If these clots travel to the brain, they can cause a stroke. 

""Wearables that track both your pulse and heart's electrical activity by combining PPG and ECG functions have been around for a while now. However, how well this technology works for the screening of patients at elevated risk for atrial fibrillation had not yet been investigated in a real-world setting"" adds Nicole van Steijn, PhD candidate at Amsterdam UMC. 

Research, led by Winter and conducted by Van Steijn, provided 219 patients over the age of 65 and at elevated stroke risk with an Apple Watch, while 218 patients received standard care. Patients were monitored for six months, with smartwatch users wearing the watch for 12 hours a day. 

""We saw that after six months we diagnosed and treated 21 patients in the group wearing the smartwatch, of whom 57% were asymptomatic. This was against just five diagnoses in the group receiving standard care, all of whom experienced symptoms,"" says Winter. 

These research results have also been presented at the European Society of Cardiology's annual symposium in London and, in the eyes of Winter, offer solid evidence that a wearable is not only suitable for long-term screening but also increases the detection rate of heart arrythmias. 

""Using smartwatches with PPG and ECG functions aids doctors in diagnosing individuals unaware of their arrhythmia, thereby expediting the diagnostic process. Our findings suggest a potential reduction in the risk of stroke, benefiting both patients and the healthcare system by reducing costs. This reduction would offset the initial cost of the device,"" concludes Winter.

A new medical large language model (LLM) achieved over 91 percent accuracy in identifying female participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder after analyzing a short WhatsApp audio recording where participants described their week, according to a study published January 21, 2026 in the open-access journal PLOS Mental Health by Victor H. O. Otani, from Santa Casa de São Paulo School of Medical Sciences and Infinity Doctors Inc., Brazil, and colleagues.

Major depressive disorder is a mental health condition that affects over 280 million people globally, and early detection can be critical for timely treatment. Here, Otani and colleagues used machine learning models to classify individuals with and without major depressive disorder based on WhatsApp voice messages.

The authors used two 2 datasets for this study, a dataset to train their LLMs (with 7 different sub-models used) and then a dataset to test their LLMs. The training dataset consisted of 86 participants: a group of outpatients (37 women, 8 men) clinically diagnosed with major depressive disorder and a control group of 41 volunteers (30 women, 11 men) with no depression diagnoses. The dataset used to test the trained models consisted of 74 participants: 33 outpatients (17 women, 16 men) diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 41 control group participants (21 women, 20 men) with no depression diagnoses. All participants were provided informed consent and screened to exclude potential confounding factors such as other medical issues. In the training dataset, outpatient speech data was taken from WhatsApp audio recordings sent to their doctor's offices when they were symptomatic; control group participants chose their own routine WhatsApp audio voice messages to share. For the test dataset, speech data taken from the outpatient group and the control group were the same: recorded WhatsApp messages counting from 1-10, as well as audio messages describing their past week. All audio messages in both datasets were from native Brazilian Portuguese speakers.

The LLMs showed greater accuracy when classifying women compared to men as depressed VS not-depressed, particularly when given the ""describe your week"" data, with an accuracy rate of 91.9 percent for the highest-performing model. The highest-performing model's accuracy when classifying male participants was 75 percent for the same ""describe your week"" audio. (This may potentially be explained by the higher number of women participants in the model training dataset, as well as differences in speech patterns between men and women.) The LLMs showed more similar performance between men and women when given the ""count to 10"" data, with the highest-performing model 82 percent accurate in women and 78 percent accurate in men.

The authors are hopeful that continued refinement of their models could produce a low-cost and practical way to screen individuals for depression, as well as other potential clinical/research applications. 

Our study shows that subtle acoustic patterns in spontaneous WhatsApp voice messages can help identify depressive profiles with surprising accuracy using machine learning. This opens a promising path for low-burden, real-world digital screening tools that respect people's daily communication habits.""

Having an ischemic stroke during pregnancy or three months after pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events like heart attack or second stroke, heart disease and depression later in life. The new study is published on January 21, 2026, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke. It occurs when a clot or blockage reduces blood flow to the brain, depriving it of oxygen and nutrients.

The study also found that female participants who had a stroke during pregnancy or postpartum were less likely to be employed and more likely to be retired at the end of the study compared to those who did not have a stroke.

The study does not prove that stroke causes these health and employment effects. It only shows associations.

Having a stroke during pregnancy or postpartum is rare but several studies have shown it is on the rise. Our study sought to better understand what happens to women after a stroke during pregnancy and postpartum and found an increased risk of cardiac diseases and depression, as well as lower odds of being employed later.""

Anna Richardt, MD, study author, University of Helsinki, Finland

For the study, researchers identified 97 female participants in Finnish health care registries who had an ischemic stroke during pregnancy or postpartum, up to three months after pregnancy. They were matched to 280 female participants who did not have a stroke.

Researchers tracked the health of each person through registries and medical records for an average of 12 years, noting which participants later had cardiovascular events like heart attack, stroke and heart disease or depression.

Of participants with an initial stroke, 6% had a second stroke and 7% had a major cardiovascular event like heart attack compared to 0% of those who were stroke free at the start of the study.

Researchers also found among participants with stroke, 9% had cardiac disease, including atrial fibrillation or congestive heart failure, compared to 1% of those who did not have stroke. After adjusting for age, participants with stroke had a nearly nine times greater odds of having cardiac disease.

Of participants with stroke, 19% had depression compared to 6% of those without stroke. After adjusting for age, those with stroke had nearly four times greater odds of having depression.

Researchers also reviewed employment statistics. Of participants with stroke, 71% were employed two years prior to their stroke compared to 76% of those without stroke. By the end of the study, 66% of those with stroke were employed compared to 78% of those without stroke. After adjusting for age, researchers found that participants with stroke had 45% lower odds of being employed and nearly five times greater odds of being retired at the end of the study compared to those without stroke.

""Of those with stroke, 92% had good functional outcomes, meaning they had either completely recovered or could manage most daily activities by the end of the study,"" said Richardt. ""Still, more than one-third of those with stroke were out of work at the end of the study. Our findings highlight the need for adequate stroke prevention, monitoring and rehabilitation to improve the long-term health for those who have stroke during pregnancy.""

A limitation of the study was the small number of participants with stroke since stroke during pregnancy is rare.

The study was supported by the Finnish government and Helsinki University Hospital.

The University of California, Irvine has received its first award from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, launching a major effort to improve how doctors detect and treat diseases of the lymphatic system.

The up-to-five-year, $7.45 million award supports a project called ""Quantitative Assessment of Thoracic Duct Obstruction,"" part of ARPA-H's Lymphatic Imaging, Genomics and Phenotyping Technologies program, which seeks to better understand and diagnose lymphatic disease.

Led by Sabee Molloi, professor of radiological sciences, and co-investigator Cholsoon Jang, assistant professor of biological chemistry, the School of Medicine team is developing a safer, noninvasive way to assess lymphatic fluid flow, a process that has long been difficult to measure.

The researchers are working on an advanced imaging approach that uses CT scans to track lymphatic flow, paired with blood-based markers that offer additional clues about how the lymphatic system is functioning. Together, the tools could give physicians a clearer picture of problems that are often missed or diagnosed late.

This award gives us the opportunity to assess the lymphatic system in ways that haven't been possible before. Our goal is to make diagnosis more precise and treatment decisions more informed, without putting additional burden on patients.""

 Sabee Molloi, professor of radiological sciences, University of California, Irvine

The project focuses on thoracic duct obstruction, a condition that can disrupt the body's ability to move lymph fluid and is linked to serious health problems such as chronic abdominal pain, fluid buildup and nutritional deficiencies. Because symptoms can be vague and imaging options are limited, many patients go years without clear answers.

Currently in the early phase of the up-to-five-year endeavor, researchers are refining the imaging technology and testing it in preclinical models to ensure accuracy and reliability. Later phases will involve patient studies aimed at bringing the technology into clinical use.

""Our aim is to bridge the gap between innovation and patient care,"" Jang said. ""By combining imaging with biological signals from the blood, we hope to give clinicians more actionable information to guide treatment.""

If successful, the approach could help doctors choose the most appropriate protocol for each patient, whether that means monitoring symptoms, adjusting treatment plans or pursuing minimally invasive procedures, ultimately improving outcomes for people living with lymphatic disorders.

The ARPA-H LIGHT program is focused on advancing new technologies that shed light on the lymphatic system, which remains largely unexplored despite its importance to human health.

VALENCIA, Spain (Jan. 15, 2026) – The U.S. Under-16 Girls' National Team shutout the Belgium U-17 Women's National Team in the third and final match of their January Camp in Spain. The U-16 GNT faced Germany twice before this match and saw improved results each match, coming away with a loss, a tie and a win today over the Belgians.

A little more than two thirds of the way through the first half, the U.S. opened the scoring. Midfielder Valentina Perrotta won the ball and dribbled up the field. She took a shot from outside the 18-yard box and sent it past the goalkeeper to put the U.S. up 1-0, burying what would ultimately become the game winner. 

Perrotta's goal was the only one of the first half, but less than four minutes into the second, the U.S. tally would double.Forward Bridget Askekohme sent a cross into the box from the left side of the field, driving the ball towards the top of the six-yard box. Forward Kayleigh Cabigon put pressure on a Belgian defender who ultimately deflected the ball into the back of the net.

The next two goals came in quick succession. In the 72nd minute, Asekomhe scored a goal of her own. She shot the ball from inside the box which Belgian goalkeeper Maud Deschutter saved but couldn't hold. Asekomhe wasted no time jumping on the rebound to put a first-time finish past the Deschutter.

In the 78th minute, forward Eileena Chinyadza scored the final goal of the match. Having subbed on for Cabigon, Chinyadza picked up a loose ball on the top of the 18-yard box as Belgium was trying to build out. Her shot sailed past Deschutter and into the back of the net.

The U.S. didn't face much in the way of attack with Belgium mustering just five shots to the USA's 13, while U.S. goalkeepers Gabby Gjeldum and Olivia Hasan combined for two saves to keep Belgium off the board.

The U.S U-16 GNT leaves Spain 1-1-1 to start 2026. All 20 players on this U.S. roster were born in 2010, which is the cutoff birth year to be eligible for the 2027 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, the tournament that this age group of players will be attempting to qualify for at the 2027 Concacaf Women's U-17 Championship.

Briana Scurry. Hope Solo. Aylssa Naeher.

Claudia Dickey?

After claiming the starting goalkeeper job for the Seattle Reign in the NWSL two years ago, Charlotte native and former UNC standout Claudia Dickey is working to convince head coach Emma Hayes that she's next to be the best last line of defense for the U.S. Women's National Team. With six starts since her first call-up to a January training camp, she is making her case with five shutouts. With four consecutive starts, heading into this next camp, she is the first goalkeeper since Naeher to do that.

But it will take dozens, if not a hundred games, and a World Cup trophy or two to make the list above. Solo earned 202 caps for her country, Scurry 175, Naeher 115.

Hayes included Dickey, who turned 26 in early January, on a 26-player roster for a year-opening training camp being held from January 14-21 in Carson, Calif. The camp will conclude with matches against Paraguay on Jan. 24 at the Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, and Jan. 27 against Chile at Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara.

Of the three goalkeepers on the roster, Dickey is the veteran with six caps. Mandy McGlynn of the Utah Royals has four, while Jordan Silkowitz from Bay FC has yet to debut for the national team.

Lee Horton, the long-time Charlotte Latin soccer coach who retired in 2022 with 1,012 girls' and boys' team wins, remembers when he recognized Dickey's talent.

“She was in the eighth grade, and I was watching her play both soccer and basketball, just as a coach at the school, and she was ridiculous at both. She is just gifted. God gifts some of us, and he gifted her to the brim.

“I just loved to watch the girl play basketball. In middle school, she would just get the ball and dribble through the entire team, past everybody, go down to the basket, and then stop and wait for the first girl from her team to come running in, and she would give them the ball and let them score. She loved having an assist better than scoring a basket.

“So I pulled her aside in the middle of our campus one day, and said, ‘Claudia, you are going to play either big-time soccer or big-time basketball in college without a doubt, and I don't care which one it is, because you're so good at both.'”

And he promised to support her in that effort.

Horton also liked to hoard goalkeepers. A former netminder at UNC himself, at one time he had three future NCAA Division I players competing for the position at Latin. Along with Dickey, there was Ruthie Jones, who went on to an All-ACC, All-American career for Duke (2019-2023), and Paige Nurkin, who became the starting keeper at Columbia University (2020-23), with a graduate season (2024) at Wake Forest.

Over her career at Latin, Dickey had a .39 goals-against average and scored 16 goals when she played in the field, including the game-winning goal in the 2017 state final against Providence Day. Equally adept as a point guard, Dickey earned NCISAA All-State honors in both soccer and basketball.

Horton was right about Dickey, but should have used a different conjunctive as Dickey played soccer and basketball for UNC her freshman year. On the pitch, she split time with former Carolina Ascent keeper Samantha Leshnak-Murphy, a senior, starting six of 16 games, earning a 6-2-1 record in goal. She also scored a penalty kick against UCLA in an NCAA quarterfinal shootout win.

In her 4,187 minutes in the Carolina goal from 2018-21, she posted a remarkable .47 goals against average and 15 complete game shutouts.

She was selected by Seattle Reign FC with the 20th pick in the 2022 NWSL Draft.

Before she could get her chance with the national team, though, Dickey had to establish herself at the club level, and she was one of several talented goalkeepers at Seattle, where she did what most rookies do their first year: She sat and watched when the whistle blew as Phallon Tullis-Joyce started all 29 matches across competitions.

Her second season started the same way. After three successful outings — all clean sheet wins — in the NWSL Challenge Cup, she finally started her first regular-season match on Aug. 27, 2023. It was a 2-1 away loss to Angel City.

“I honestly didn't play well the first two games, and we lost in my first game,” Dickey said.

“Playing goalkeeper is a confidence thing,” she added. “And when you don't play games, I think it's really hard to go in because you want to prove yourself, or you want to be the one who makes a difference. But I think I've learned over the years, it's about being good and being steady, and not trying to go out and do the crazy things, or not trying to prove that you're good enough to be there. I think it's more important to be that backbone of the team, and be able to communicate with and rely on everybody in front of you, and when it gets to you, basically just doing your job.

“And I think the first game or two that I played, I was like, in a way, trying to prove myself when I didn't need to. I came out of the box when I didn't need to multiple times. That was hard at first. I think I struggled with that.”

But head coach Laura Harvey kept Dickey in the net to close the regular season during a playoff chase. The next two games were draws, the second a clean sheet. As she grew into the moment, Dickey kept the opposition scoreless in the last regular-season game, 3-0 against the Chicago Stars. Harvey continued to start Dickey for the playoffs — if the wheel ain't broke, don't fix it — and Seattle won two 1-0 games to make the NWSL Final against Gotham FC.

Dickey believes that getting the opportunity to play “was a mix of we were fighting for playoffs, and she wanted to maybe see me because I was also out of contract (after that season).”

“It wasn't anything to do with (Tullis-Joyce), but (Seattle head coach) Laura (Harvey) started giving me — I started, the last six games of that season. Phallon was still there, and I think it was obviously like we were both probably good enough to be fighting for a spot.”

Dickey, then 23, already believed she could challenge Tullis-Joyce, then 26, for the starting spot. The NWSL, in general, and most teams around the world, give great weight to veterans, especially when it comes to goalkeepers.

Dickey doesn't believe Tullis-Joyce left to dodge a competition for the job.

“I think when Phallon got the opportunity to go to (Manchester) United, she was, obviously, why would you not want to go play in Europe? They're one of the best teams in the world. So I think it wasn't necessarily because I was going to take the spot from her. She got this other opportunity, and Laura, for the rest of the year, wanted to play me.”

Dickey's competition for the starting job will reignite the respectful rivalry with Tullis-Joyce, though not this week. As this is not an international window, only NWSL players will be in this camp.

“I think Claudia is in a strong position,” said Hayes in a pre-camp press conference. “I think it's fair to say her and Phallon have been given more of the minutes over this period of time. Phallon obviously cannot join this camp because she's a European-based player.”

Hayes did not commit to a given starter but did say, “I feel very strongly about Claudia and Phallon at this moment in time,” adding, “There is a pool of players. They just need to keep developing a little bit more experience.”

She also noted the move of Casey Murphy, the current active cap leader among goalkeepers with 20, from North Carolina Courage to Boston, saying, “Be curious to see how that invigorates her.”

Murphy was the backup USWNT goalkeeper to Naeher at the 2023 World Cup and the 2024 Olympics. While she has 20 caps for the U.S., she has not appeared for the team since October 2024.

Currently the head coach of the Carolina Ascent, Philip Poole's previous assignment was being the goalkeeper coach for the USWNT. As a former academy director of the Charlotte Soccer Academy, he coached all of the Latin keepers and others in the region, so he's seen Dickey's rise to this opportunity and knows that she responds well to a competitive challenge.

“There's been three predominant goalkeepers in the U.S. National Team tenure. You might look at a goalkeeper being in the right place at the wrong time, right? So, Nicole Barnhart has 54 caps, but she sat behind Hope Solo for all of her career. Not to say Barney could not have played more, but again, great goalkeeper, maybe the wrong time.”

That's not the case here. With Naeher's retirement in 2024, Poole says, “There's no current, clear number one. I think the days of seeing one goalkeeper forever dominant with 200 caps might be over, but there's certainly a runway for her to become number one.”

He says her skill set, especially with the ball at her feet, may be the best of the bunch, but that her success must come between the ears.

“Can she put together the mindset, mentality, all the things that we know are in her and confident are in her. She's got to bring them out, and she's got to ride the highs and the lows, because Scurry, Naeher, Solo have all had highs and lows. And they set themselves apart with how they dealt with them.”

Scurry, Solo, Naeher, Dickey. That's the conjecture of observers, not herself.

Now that she's been in the net for the national team six times, Dickey hasn't given a thought to achieving legendary status. She knows it's far too early for that, and told the Observer that she really hadn't taken a moment to step back and appreciate the accomplishment.

“My dream has always been to be on the national team. I've always wanted to do this. Not to take away from how special it is, but I think you have to believe in yourself so much that you don't let the arena, the game, the importance of it, get to you. And treating it like a game while you're in it, like, I don't think I've stopped until probably now that I'm talking about it with you, to be like, holy… Like, how proud I am of myself for getting to this point in my career and for being able to believe that, yes, I do think if I do everything right, and I continue to improve in all these different areas that I've talked about with the national team coaches and all the things that I need to continue to do, that yeah, I can fight for a spot as long as I continue to believe in myself.

“For me, it's always about pushing myself. Even when things go well, there's always something that can be better.”

January 22 – The Women's Super League (WSL) has raised “serious concerns” over the scheduling of the inaugural FIFA Women's Club World Cup, set to run from January 5–30, 2028, warning the decision could be “catastrophic” for both the domestic competition and player welfare. 

FIFA insists its calendar works because it has been approved. Domestic leagues are increasingly asking a different question: approved by whom? 

The dates, signed off by the FIFA Council in December, land squarely in the middle of the European season. In the WSL's case, at least five match rounds would be affected, potentially more once travel, time zones, and recovery periods are factored in. 

A WSL spokesperson described January scheduling as “at best inconvenient, and at worst, catastrophic,” adding that the league's clear preference is for the tournament to be staged in the summer. The league has formally written to FIFA, arguing it was not properly consulted before the dates were finalised. 

The WSL has stressed it does not want to block clubs from competing and supports efforts to grow the global women's game. But the option to decline an invitation exists. The question is, when will clubs feel compelled to use it? 

The calendar of the next few years is packed. The 2028 Club World Cup is scheduled between the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil and the LA 2028 Olympics. Two tournaments that women's football has been built around over the last three decades.  

FIFA's chief football officer Jill Ellis previously said: “We will enter a new calendar conversation in 2030… taking into account all shareholders, players are a massive part of that. This was the window that I think everybody agreed upon.” 

The tournament was originally planned for 2026, then pushed to 2028. In its place, FIFA scheduled the Champions Cup in late January, directly clashing with WSL fixtures anyway. 

At some point, clubs may decide that protecting players, competitions, and commercial stability matters more than complying with a calendar built elsewhere.

The Women's Super League sounded the alarm about the timing of the proposed FIFA Women's Club World Cup, warning of a potential ""catastrophic"" effect on English clubs and player workload.

Officials from England's top league wrote to FIFA to express deep concern about its plan to stage the inaugural global women's tournament from Jan. 5 to 30 in 2028, possibly in Qatar and smack in the middle ​of the English domestic schedule.

The event could force the postponement of fixtures across ‍five WSL ⁠match weeks and create a scheduling backlog. Other European leagues, including ‍the top leagues in France and Spain, run on similar schedules.

After criticism of Qatar's human rights record resurfaced amid reports it could host a future Women's Club World Cup, FIFA chief football officer Jill Ellis tried to deflect.

Imagine the mental gymnastics it takes to accuse the United States of being ""anti-gay"" while bending over backward to defend Qatar.

Yet that's exactly what FIFA executive Jill Ellis did this week when asked about growing criticism of Qatar as a potential host nation for a future Women's Club World Cup.

The Middle Eastern country — which hosted the men's World Cup in 2022 — is now reportedly exploring a bid to host the women's tournament. That immediately raised red flags for obvious reasons: the country's treatment of women, its criminalization of homosexuality and its complete lack of meaningful investment in the women's game.

For reference, Qatar's own women's national team has been inactive for more than a decade.

So when Ellis, the former U.S. Women's National Team coach and now FIFA's chief football officer, was asked whether those realities should factor into FIFA's decision-making, she didn't actually answer the question. 

Instead, she tried to flip it back on the United States.

""I'm going to put my personal hat on. There are over 500 bills in the U.S. with anti-gay legislation on them,"" Ellis said. ""I also come from the U.S., but right now there's a big light being shown on that. So I'm very, very careful not to throw stones in glass houses, right?""

That might be one of the most disingenuous takes I've heard.

Let's be very clear about what critics are talking about when they raise concerns about Qatar.

Women in Qatar are not treated as legal equals to men. That's true both socially and legally.

They are subject to male guardianship laws that govern marriage, divorce, travel and family life. A woman needs approval from a male guardian to marry. A man does not. Men can have multiple spouses. Women cannot.

Under Qatar's personal status law, wives are legally obligated to ""obey"" their husbands. Women can lose financial support if they refuse sex or work without their husband's permission. Divorce rights are unequal. Inheritance rights are unequal.

In some cases, unmarried Qatari women under 25 must obtain male guardian permission to travel abroad. Male relatives can request travel bans on female family members through the state.

Now an executive for FIFA, Jill Ellis is the winningest coach in USWNT history, leading the team to two consecutive FIFA Women's World Cup titles in 2015 and 2019.

Liberal women in the United States can don their performative Handmaid's Tale costumes all they want. But what's happening in Qatar is actual second-class citizenship for women, written directly into law.

Unlike the United States, where same-sex relationships and marriages are legal nationwide, homosexuality is criminalized in Qatar.

Consensual same-sex sexual activity can be punished with prison sentences. LGBTQ expression is censored. Advocacy is restricted. Same-sex couples cannot marry, cannot live openly, and cannot challenge the law without serious personal and legal risk.

We saw this play out during the 2022 Men's World Cup in Qatar, when players were threatened with punishment for wearing ""One Love"" armbands — a threat FIFA itself enforced, by the way.

But sure. The United States, where men parade through the streets in thongs and make out with each other on parade floats during Pride Month, is totally the same.

Let's contrast Qatar's laws with what Ellis lumped together as ""anti-gay legislation"" in the United States.

The ACLU did, in fact, track 616 ""anti-LGBTQ"" bills in the U.S. in 2025. But when you dig into those bills, the narrative really begins to fall apart.

Those hundreds of bills fall into just a handful of categories:

If you want to disagree with any of these policy proposals, be my guest. But calling them ""anti-gay"" is a gross mischaracterization.

None of those laws criminalize homosexuality. None of them make it illegal to be gay or transgender. None of them impose prison sentences based on whom you choose to love, marry or sleep with.

Ellis herself is married to a woman. Good thing they don't live in Qatar.

Ellis framed her comments as a warning against hypocrisy — the idea that Americans shouldn't criticize Qatar because the United States supposedly has its own ""anti-gay"" problem.

With even a little bit of scrutiny, that framing collapses immediately.

She's comparing American legislative debates to a country where women lack basic legal autonomy and homosexuality is a crime. It's completely unserious. And insulting to all of our intelligence.

The bills Ellis is referring to are not about criminalizing gay people, jailing adults for consensual relationships or erasing civil rights. They are about defining sex as a biological reality in law and shielding children from sexually explicit material and irreversible medical interventions. 

Not the same thing.

The United States is debating how best to balance competing interests in a pluralistic society. Qatar throws human rights to the wind and enforces hierarchy by law.

These are not glass houses. They aren't even in the same neighborhood.

The Women's League Cup is undergoing a major revamp for next season which will include adopting a similar format to the Champions League and possibly altering its name.

It has already been confirmed that Women's Super League (WSL) clubs who qualify for the Women's Champions League will not compete.

And in further changes, the WSL has said it plans to introduce a Swiss-style format for the league phase to guarantee more games for all participating teams.

Currently, all WSL2 and some WSL teams play in round-robin groups of four or five in the first round, with the winners progressing to the quarter-finals. Teams taking part in the Champions League - Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United this season - enter at the knockout stage.

In the revamped competition, all participating clubs would enter the league phase and be drawn to play six other sides.

The top eight teams in the league phase would progress to the quarter-finals. Unlike in the Champions League, there will be no play-off round because there is no space in the fixture calendar.

The name of the competition is still being discussed. It will ""probably not"" be called the League Cup because it will not have all the league teams involved.

A WSL spokesperson said other options, including scrapping the League Cup, had been considered, but they felt these changes would give ""clarity of purpose"" to the competition.

""The calendar is one of the biggest constraints and challenges, there is only so much space on weekends for us to work with,"" the spokesperson said.

""We've listened to fans and clubs, and it felt like it didn't have complete purpose, including Champions League teams entering at the quarter-final stage.

""We even put on the table, do we not have a secondary cup competition?

""But the challenge is that top players at top clubs get loads of minutes, loads of matches. If you are in the WSL2, you have a real disparity – we want to close that gap.

""We looked at whether Champions League clubs could enter a secondary team, but at this stage we deemed it was not possible.""

The spokesperson said plans were being finalised with clubs and commercial partners, and would be put before the Football Association within the next four weeks.

The changes come amid the women's domestic calendar growing ever more crowded.

The Women's Champions League this season expanded from 16 to 18 clubs at the league phase, with Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United involved – the first time three WSL teams had reached that point.

Arsenal and Manchester United will play in the knockout play-offs – a new round of games introduced this season - after finishing fifth and sixth respectively in the league.

Next year the number of domestic top-flight games is also set to increase following the expansion of the WSL from 12 to 14 teams.

WSL organisers have confirmed that teams who play in the Champions League will not drop into the secondary domestic cup even if they fail to progress through the qualifying rounds.

BBC Sport also understands that the league phase will still be regionalised, as it is currently, to help clubs with travel time and costs.

Sponsorship of the competition is also uncertain. The deal with current sponsors Subway expires this summer, although it has an option to extend the contract by a year.

Real Madrid and Barcelona bring in more revenues than any other clubs David Ramos/Getty Images

Real Madrid and Barcelona were football's top-earning superpowers last season, according to Deloitte's latest Football Money League report.

Madrid topped the annual listing of club revenues for the third year running and 15th time in 21 seasons, generating £975million ($1.309bn) in 2024-25, leading second-placed Barcelona by more than £150m.

Liverpool became the second English club to book more than £700million in revenue during their charge to the Premier League title, yet their income last term was only enough to rank them fifth worldwide. It is the first time in the report's 29-year history that no English side has featured in the top four.



The clubs on Deloitte's yearly list are routinely labelled football's ‘richest', though that is a debatable description.

High revenues don't automatically equal profits. Chunky costs can easily gobble up the resources of even the biggest earners. Of the 10 clubs on this year's 20-team list to have published full accounts for the 2024-25 season, four posted a pre-tax loss.

Barcelona, up from sixth spot in 2023-24 to second, are a timely example. Despite soaring revenues, they turned £819million of income into a £7m pre-tax deficit. As detailed by The Athletic in November, Spain's reigning champions are far from free of financial quandaries, even as they boast one of the highest income figures in football history. Their number also included £60m in one-off sales of 30-year personal seat licences (PSLs) at the refurbished Camp Nou — transactions, in short, that can't be repeated for three decades.

Deloitte's document is, by design, limited in scope, primarily focusing on revenues. Wage bills can be extrapolated — as The Athletic has done further in this piece — but the report does not deal with the many costs of running a modern football club. An appearance on the list does not necessarily mean the side concerned are in good financial health.

A further caveat is that Deloitte can only include the teams who provide its staff with data. Most relevant clubs do, but not all. The full report runs to 30 teams but makes no mention of Nottingham Forest or Fulham, who would both be expected to feature. Their names were omitted as neither provided Deloitte with the required data; Forest were notable absentees from last year's list, too.

Yet there is still much new detail to be analysed.

For one, in a mirroring of findings from the women's football version of the report published this week, commercial income leads the way among the highest-earning clubs. That has not always been the case in men's football, as TV money has generally propelled earnings for much of this century, but the 2024-25 season was the third in succession where commercial income comprised the highest revenue segment.



The top 20 clubs generated £4.46billion in commercial revenues last season, up from £4.2bn a year earlier. Growth was especially prevalent among the already wealthy — of the £261m increase in this sector between this year's top 20 and those in the report's prior edition, £226m came from sides in the current top 10.

Commercial income drove the ascent of Spain's big two. Clubs categorise ‘income' in different ways, but using Deloitte's definition of commercial income saw Madrid generate an enormous £499million last season. Barcelona, at £438m, were some way back, but also the only other side to top £400m commercially.

Behind them, Bayern Munich (£388million), Manchester City (£343m), Manchester United (£333m), Paris Saint-Germain (£308m) and Liverpool (£307m) each topped £300m. These figures highlight the gulf in commercial revenue even among football's richest: four clubs in the top 20 generated less than £100m from commercial dealings.

Broadcast revenues might have been eclipsed, but at £3.95billion they still comprised a mammoth source of income across the game.

Real Madrid again led the way (£281m), trailed by Manchester City (£278m), Arsenal (£269m) and Liverpool (£269m). Healthy domestic TV contracts are still important, even as last year marked the first season of a bumper new Champions League deal. PSG took in a record prize-money haul from winning that competition but low domestic payouts in France limited their broadcast take overall to £246m.

Tim Bridge, lead partner in the Deloitte Sports Business Group, which produces the report, highlighted the ongoing importance of broadcast revenues, which are generally correlated with a team's match results. Bridge says: “On-pitch performance remains a primary driver for clubs to progress to the upper echelons of the ranking, with many clubs benefitting from new and expanded European and international club tournaments.”

FIFA's greatly expanded Club World Cup helped several sides, especially the winner. Chelsea's annual revenue would have fallen without the bounty from last summer's competition, which was held in the United States.

Four clubs — Aston Villa, West Ham United, Benfica and Inter — relied on broadcast income for more than 50 per cent of their 2024-25 revenue, which naturally marks them out as financially vulnerable if on-field performances wane. In Villa's case, TV money accounted for 63.7 per cent of total revenues, so a sizeable fall can be expected in 2025-26, when there will be no repeat of last season's venture to the Champions League quarter-finals as they are in the less lucrative Europa League this time.

Villa were one of three Premier League teams to improve across each of the three main revenue streams last season, along with Liverpool and Arsenal. Villa's club-record £378million revenue represented a 42 per cent increase, the second-biggest proportional change among the top 20, behind Stuttgart (79 per cent). Both owed much to the revamped, expanded Champions League format brought in for last season.



Four English clubs — Villa, Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur — enjoyed £20million-plus rises in matchday income. United still lead the way in England but Arsenal's £154m means they've increased takings from the Emirates Stadium by over £50m in just two seasons. 

However, it was those who enjoyed smaller, or even negative growth, at the turnstiles who stood out. 

Manchester City, Newcastle United and West Ham all generated less in 2024-25 than a year earlier, while Chelsea's £7million improvement still left them only 10th overall for gate receipts. Stadium concerns dominate the agenda at those four clubs: City are expanding the Etihad Stadium, Newcastle remain in limbo over St James' Park, empty seats and boycotts are a hot topic at West Ham, and Chelsea's future at Stamford Bridge is uncertain.

Should English clubs be concerned about tumbling out of the top four for the first time?

One key reason behind that, and Liverpool's debut on top of the domestic pile, is what's been going on at Manchester United. They announced record revenues last autumn but growth has been glacial in recent years, allowing peers to overtake them. From never having been out of the top five since Deloitte introduced the report in the mid-1990s, United fell to eighth — as projected by The Athletic when their latest accounts were published. 

Liverpool trailed PSG in fourth by less than £1million, while Manchester City and Arsenal were both within £10m of the £700m mark. PSG's lofty position looks less secure, too. They booked a notable fall in commercial income and fell from third to fourth overall; the drop would have been further without their Champions League triumph.

The French champions were overtaken by both Barcelona and Bayern, and the income-generating capabilities of Barca and Real Madrid look more robust challenges to the financial might of the Premier League. Madrid are a revenue-making juggernaut; their arch-rivals, even with the one-off income from those PSLs, hope to soon reap the rewards of their improved and reopened Camp Nou.

Bayern, meanwhile, have long been commercially astute and are closing in on £400million annually from that stream. But it is worth noting they also benefited from the Club World Cup, and the lower amount of TV money in Germany — as in France, though to a much lesser extent — is a limiting factor. Without their income from FIFA's new summer showpiece, it's likely Bayern would have again been in the fifth spot they occupied in 2023-24, and perhaps further back.

James Savage, a director in Deloitte's Sport Business Group, said the sight of no English clubs in the top four “reemphasises the importance of on-pitch performance”, but observed a signal of their strength in how “‘Big Six' clubs occupied spots five to 10 on the list despite only one reaching the Champions League quarterfinals or further.”

While not the headline figures, Deloitte's report also details signs of better cost control among football's elite.

Of the 18 clubs to appear in both this list and the previous year's edition, 13 reduced their wage bills as a proportion of revenues. Of the five who didn't — two remained consistent with 2023-24, three paid out a higher percentage of income on salaries — there was one clear theme: they were all in the Premier League.



In all, the combined wages-to-revenue ratio of the 19 clubs in the list to provide Deloitte with salaries data for 2024-25 (Stuttgart didn't) was 55.5 per cent, five per cent lower than a year earlier, when there was also one team that didn't provide this same information. That ratio reduction was driven by combined revenues improving from £9.4billion to £10.2bn across the relevant 19 sides, while wages remained static at £5.7bn. In general terms, UEFA's squad cost rules look to be having an impact on reining in player-related expenses.

A definitive list of the highest wage payers last season can't be gleaned from Deloitte's work — lower-earning clubs may have spent proportionately more on salaries than ones who generated higher revenues — but the salary bills which can be extrapolated are instructive.

PSG's first Champions League title was achieved with the most handsomely-paid squad in European football, even as they knocked roughly £120million off their wage bill in 2024-25. It is the fourth time in five seasons they have been the highest payers in Europe.



Liverpool's own trophy-winning season in the Premier League saw them top £400million in wages for the first time, becoming only the third English club behind Manchester City (each of the last three seasons) and Chelsea (2022-23, but that included some sizeable termination payments) to go beyond that mark. At roughly £421m, wages comprised 60 per cent of revenue at Anfield, though income growth was so large (£87m) that their wages to revenue ratio actually dropped from the 63 per cent of 2023-24.

Advertisement

Deloitte included termination payments in Manchester United's wages figure, without which they would have dropped to the fifth-highest payers domestically. If we take the wage figure per the club's accounts of £313million, it would make 2024-25 the first time since the dawn of the Premier League era in 1992 that United were not among the four highest wage payers in English football.

There are myriad other strands to be tugged — Villa outspending Tottenham on wages, for one — but, as outlined earlier, Deloitte's focus is squarely on the top line rather than a full accounting of what revenues are used for.

Those revenues continue to hit new records. More than £10billion was generated by the 20 listed clubs for the first time. Among those teams, combined wages were static, suggesting an easing of the pressure brought by a continuous rise in player salaries.

Yet there are caveats, too.

Half of Deloitte's top 20 participated in the Club World Cup last summer, generating income that will not be replicated for at least another four seasons, when the competition will next be played. Several on the list made a loss in 2024-25, and more may follow.

High revenues grab the headlines, and growing income will not be sniffed at. But, as in any sector, it remains only part of the tale.

Unprecedented times call for previously unthinkable conversations when it comes to the US-shaped problem

Could European countries really decide to boycott the World Cup this summer? It is an astonishing question to be asking in 2026 and an indictment of the bind in which, as Donald Trump sows confusion around a potential annexation of Greenland, the world's most popular sport finds itself. But the idea is at least seeping into the mainstream and senior figures are asking what, in a worst-case scenario, it would take for football to meet the moment.

Unprecedented times call for previously unthinkable conversations. As the Guardian reported this week, an anniversary party for the Hungarian FA on Monday became the forum for unofficial discussions among national association heads about how a unified approach to the US-shaped problem might take shape.

While flexibility is essential in a volatile, fast-moving situation, there is an acceptance that no one can afford to be asleep if the time for action comes.

That is why there is a growing belief that Europe's governing bodies, whether led by individual federations or by Uefa itself, must cohere behind a common position – or at least prepare one. Sources have described a tightening of unity since Trump, whose suggestion on Wednesday he will not take Greenland by force – and later that there was the outlines of a deal – must surely be treated with caution.

While some federations are understood to have been relatively unbothered by the spectacle of Trump receiving a peace prize from the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, in December, choosing in certain cases to find a funny side, the gravity of current events is lost on no one.

The tight bond between Infantino's leadership and the Trump administration means European football cannot look away. There is a consensus that Fifa has chosen to politicise itself; that could bring consequences if the US president intensifies his designs on a territory that belongs, indisputably, to a Uefa member in Denmark.

Then there is the precedent of recent history. Russia was quickly frozen out of international competition after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, essentially because other countries refused to compete against them. Why should the US be treated differently if it sent in the troops, and why should its part in the World Cup be indulged into the bargain?

Some key figures expect military aggression would be the breaking point for Uefa and the federations it covers. In the event Trump's latest pronouncements stand the test of time, it means any whispers about a boycott will remain hushed for now. It remains a far-flung prospect.

None of Europe's FAs are in a rush to go public with a stance and plenty may follow their governments' positions. The question is whether that would be enough for those who feel football has a unique opportunity to assert itself.

The French sports minister, Marina Ferrari, said on Tuesday, in response to calls from elsewhere on the political spectrum, that the country has no plan to boycott but added the caveat “as it stands now”. But the German minister for sports, Christiane Schenderlein, deflected any decision making to “the competent sports associations”.

There are certainly some within football's corridors of power who feel a stand could be made while politicians prevaricate. Trump has wedded himself to the World Cup project since his first term, naturally making mention of his own hard work in steering the bid when it succeeded in 2018.

The prospect of visible, palpable damage to his latest big moment would not be easy for the president to stomach. Perhaps, if Uefa and its federations flexed their muscles, Infantino could even feel compelled to engage in far-reaching diplomacy with his friend around the Greenland problem.

Some within Uefa would strain at the leash to see Infantino put in his place. Football's biggest governing bodies endured a high-profile falling-out in May over Infantino's conduct around the Fifa congress in Paraguay, although it was quickly smoothed over in public. More moderate forces close to the organisation may not favour incendiary moves this time, with the future of global football facing enough uncertainty, but the sport has been planted in uncharted waters and could find it needs to swim hard.

The hypotheticals continue but they cannot be purely dismissed as such. Recent events have underlined that football's leadership must be agile and the message is hitting home. Initiatives such as the hugely popular petition in the Netherlands, urging a boycott of the World Cup, suggest public sentiment would be supportive of decisive action if the unthinkable came to pass.

The pitch may quietly have been rolled. The enduring hope is that, for reasons in which football is unpleasantly enmeshed, it never needs testing out.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Kansas City is preparing for an influx of visitors ahead of six matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Kansas City, MO – Kansas City is preparing for a surge of visitors as it gets ready to host World Cup matches this summer, with hotel availability and short-term rentals already tightening months before the first game kicks off.

Tourism officials estimate hundreds of thousands of visitors could pass through the metro during the tournament, while the city has roughly 36,000 hotel rooms. Some of those rooms are under contract with FIFA and unavailable to the general public, adding pressure to an already competitive lodging market.

That demand is pushing some locals to take unusual steps. Adam Kinner, a short-term rental host who owns multiple properties in the Kansas City area, says he even plans to rent out his own home during the World Cup and move in with his parents.FIFA RECEIVES RECORD 500 MILLION TICKETS REQUESTS FOR 2026 WORLD CUP

President and CEO of Visit Kansas City and the Kansas City Sports Commission, Kathy Nelson, says the city has been preparing for this moment for years and is closely monitoring hotel capacity as bookings accelerate.

""The energy, the excitement, the anticipation is unbelievable,"" Nelson said. ""Everyone's about to show up on our doorstep.""

New hotel development is also racing the clock. A 45-room boutique hotel called River Market Hotel is set to open this spring, just weeks before matches begin. The hotel's managing member, Mike Heitman, says the timing adds pressure but also opportunity.

Just as it did in Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022, politics is dominating the build up to World Cup 2026. Could discontent with Donald Trump in Europe see football heavyweights united behind such a cause?

With relations between Europe and the United States strained, calls for a Europe-led boycott of World Cup 2026 are beginning to gain traction in some quarters. Politicians, fans and football executives are among those who believe the actions of Donald Trump's administration — particularly in relation to Greenland — make participating in the tournament problematic.

Though Trump said in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday that he won't use force to annex Greenland, he immediately preceded that by saying: ""We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable.""

Given the US president's history of head-spinning U-turns on all sorts of issues, European governments must remain prepared for all eventualities despite the later announcement that the framework of a Greenland deal had been agreed with NATO. So, too, must their football associations.

Mogens Jensen, spokesperson of the Danish Social Democrats for culture, media and sports, told DW that Denmark — of which Greenland is a semi-autonomous constituent territory — is not yet calling for a boycott.

""For my party and for myself, our view on this is that it is one of the last tools in the toolbox that you should take up,"" he said.

But, he added, were Trump to decide an invasion was the way to achieve his aim after all, things would have to change.

""I will be honest and say, yes, if that should happen, then a boycott discussion is very, very relevant,"" Jensen said moments before Trump took to the Davos stage.

""It's likely to happen if it develops into a real conflict. I sincerely hope that it will not come to this,"" he added.

Reports from various outlets suggest European football's governors, UEFA, held a meeting featuring a number of heads of football associations on Monday, with the 10% tariffs Trump slapped on eight European countries over Greenland last week likely to have been a key topic. Trump said on Wednesday that he would revoke these should the NATO deal be ""consumated.""

Of those eight nations, Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, France, and the UK (in the shape of England and Scotland) have already qualified for the tournament while Denmark, Sweden and Northern Ireland (also UK) are in the playoffs. The final country, Finland, did not qualify.

It isn't just Danish politicians that are forced to consider their options. In Germany, a handful have spoken on the boycott issue. Roderich Kiesewetter of Chancellor Friedrich Merz' Christian Democrats, sits on the Bundestag's foreign affairs committee and said military action may not even be required for a boycott.

""If Trump follows through on his announcements and threats regarding Greenland and starts a trade war with the EU, it's hard for me to imagine European countries participating in the World Cup,"" he told the Augsburg Allgemeine newspaper.

However, Chris­ti­ane Schen­de­r­lein, Germany's state min­is­ter for sports, has kicked the can to the country's football association, the DFB.

""Decisions on par­ti­cip­a­tion or boy­cotts at major sport­ing events lie solely with the com­pet­ent sports asso­ci­ations, not with politi­cians,"" she told news agency AFP.

The DFB has not responded to a request from DW for comment on the issue.

Teun van de Keuken became frustrated by what he sees as political inaction in the face of one NATO member threatening another, among other Trump policies, and began a petition in his native Netherlands which now stands at 135,000 signatures and climbing.

""Sports associations almost always say we don't want to mix politics and sports but the problem is the politics are already there and you have to take a stand,"" van de Keuken told DW.

Van de Keuken is now looking for the best way to get the petition to a broader global audience and tap into what he believes is broad fan dissatisfaction with the tournament.

""This boycott idea is now popular amongst football fans, like me. I wouldn't like it if this happens as we won't have a World Cup, which is always a highlight in sports and I love it. But I think now the political situation is more important.""

In the eyes of van de Keuken and many others, FIFA President Gianni Infantino's very public cozying up to Trump has made FIFA's usual insistence on its politically neutral stance even harder to accept. Danish politician Jensen is also concerned that this will allow Trump to use the tournament for ""propaganda.""

""I have my fears when you see that FIFA suddenly thinks the president of the US should have a peace prize, which has never existed before. I don't know on what grounds FIFA suddenly needs to award a peace prize, but it could be a warning of what could await us when the tournament happens in the US.""

Jensen is not alone in his misgivings, even if most political parties and federations are sitting back and waiting to see which, if any, of Trump's announcements will come to pass. The new tariffs are to come into effect on February 1, if the NATO deal Trump refers to is not signed by then. That's 10 days before UEFA's Executive Committee (Exco) meets in Brussels.

That meeting could prove decisive in any efforts to form a European alliance to boycott the tournament. With 16 of the 48 teams at the World Cup and the world's most powerful club sides from Europe, any move by the continent's associations would likely see the rest of the footballing world take notice — with some possibly to follow.

While there have also been calls from politicians in the UK, France and elsewhere both for and against boycotts, European champion Spain may be one of the countries expected to lead any potential charge. The country's prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, was one of a handful of world leaders who called for Israel to be barred from international sports competitions last year while Spain, along with the Netherlands, was one of several countries that boycotted the Eurovision Song Contest over the war in Gaza.

Another country that has often stood up in human rights disputes, and would be impacted by the tariffs if they come into effect, is Norway. Lise Klaveness, the president of Norway's FA (NFF) —  who is also on UEFA's Exco — was another to call for a boycott of Israel, while Norway's players wore protest t-shirts in support of Qatari migrant workers before the 2022 World Cup in the Middle Eastern country.

But Klaveness told reporters in Norway on Tuesday that, if there were to be a boycott, no country could or should go it alone.

 ""We do not believe that an isolated boycott on the part of NFF is an effective means of lasting change. In these times, it is particularly important that countries in Europe speak with one voice and stand united,"" she said.

WELLSLEY, Mass. (WBZ NewsRadio) — Excitement is in the air at Babson College as the French national team is set to train on the campus for this summer's FIFA World Cup. 

In a recent announcement the French Football Association said that they have decided to pick Boston as their home base for the tournament and will be using Babson's fields in Wellsley to train for their games.

One of those games is set to be played at Gillette Stadium on June 26th as Les Bleus will face off against Norway.

However, Gillette Stadium will temporarily rename itself to Boston Stadium for the duration of the games, due to FIFA's strict rules that forbid corporate branded stadium names.

Reactions from students about the team's future presence on campus has many both excited and shocked.

“I mean that's definitely cool, I've always been a big fan of [Kylian] Mbappé, so I'm kind of surprised they're even coming to Babson cause I didn't even know that we had a soccer scene here, but that's pretty cool,” said one student.

One freshman coincidentally from France says that general excitement can be felt nearly everywhere at the university.

“A lot of Babson students are excited since the French squad has so many top players and it's one of the favorites in the tournament,” he said. 

“I think this puts the Babson name on the map,” he added.

France is currently one of the top teams predicted to win this year's World Cup as they already have two trophies under their belt, one from 1998 and a more recent win from 2018. 

However, countries like Spain and England are also possible strong competitors, while Argentina looks to snag the win once again after winning the previous tournament in Qatar back in 2022.

When asked where the players should fuel up before hitting the fields to train this summer one student pointed to the obvious choice. 

“They can always go to the Trim dining hall, which some people like, it would be funny to see Mbappé in Trim for sure.”

The 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off this summer on June 11th.

The men's French national team will train at Babson College in Wellesley for the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The French Football Federation made the announcement revealed the Les Bleus — who boasts star player Kylian Mbappé on their team — chose Hartwell-Rogers soccer field at Babson.

“That's definitely cool, I've always been a big fan of Mbappé, so I'm kind of surprised they're even coming to Babson cause I didn't even know that we had a soccer scene here,” a Babson student told WBZ. 

France will play one its World Cup games at Gillette Stadium on June 26 against Norway. The stadium — home of the New England Patriots and New England Revolution — will temporarily be renamed “Boston Stadium” due to FIFA's rules that don't allow stadiums to be branded by a corporate business. 

France is one of the top teams in this year's World Cup. It will try to win its third title and first since 2018. 

The World Cup begins June 1.

Alexander-Arnold ‘told to find new club' as Real Madrid write off ex-Liverpool star's difficult spell in Spain","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/trent-alexander-arnold-find-new-club-real-madrid-england-difficult-spell-spain/blt79490d750fff739d","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 11:15:01 GMT","

Trent Alexander-Arnold's dream move to Real Madrid has quickly turned into a nightmare, with it being reported that the ex-Liverpool defender has been told to find a new club. The England international headed to Spain in 2025 after running down his contract at Anfield, but has found the going tough at Santiago Bernabeu and is being deemed surplus to requirements.

Real paid a small fee for a player heading towards free agency last summer in order to bring him into their plans for the FIFA Club World Cup. Alexander-Arnold made his Blancos bow in that competition, with big things being expected of him.

The buccaneering 27-year-old established a reputation at Liverpool that saw him break the mould for full-backs. As comfortable flying forward and providing assists as he is tracking back, the Merseyside native changed how the modern game is played.

Real were understandably keen to acquire that skill set, with Alexander-Arnold tipped to slot seamlessly into their plans as another ball-playing option that could provide ammunition for fearsome forwards Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior.

Things have not played out as planned, with injury issues doing little to aid Alexander-Arnold's cause. He has made just 11 appearances for Real this season, with the most recent of those coming on December 3.

According to El Nacional, the situation in Madrid has “reached breaking point”. Interim Blancos boss Alvaro Arbeloa is said to have informed Alexander-Arnold that “he is not part of the team's plans”.

It is claimed that Alexander-Arnold's “defensive fragility has been exposed” while offensively he has “not provided the imbalance or precision that was expected”. Coaching staff at the Bernabeu believe that “the Englishman has never fully adapted”, despite having fellow countryman and close friend Jude Bellingham alongside him.

Alexander-Arnold stands accused of becoming “predictable” at both ends of the field, with Real ready to write off their experiment. Former head coach and fellow former Liverpool star Xabi Alonso had suggested that the energetic defender would be given time.

He said: “Trent is a top player, and we need him. It's his first year, and this adjustment period is normal. He's also demanding of himself, and we have to support him through this significant change.”

Alonso has been relieved of his coaching duties, and Alexander-Arnold may soon follow him through the exits. That is because, as reported by El Nacional, “the club understands that his continuation makes no sense and that prolonging the situation would only harm the player and the team itself”. It is claimed that a sale will now be sanctioned in the summer.

Arbeloa is said to have made Alexander-Arnold aware of that stance in “a frank conversation”. Those talks are said to have made it clear that “for his own good, he must look for an exit in the summer market”. Real Madrid's current boss has stated that no game time will seen under his tutelage. It is pointed out that this is not a “disciplinary decision, but a purely sporting one”.

Alexander-Arnold is considered to be in need of a “less demanding context, where he can regain confidence and continuity”. He is aware that his time in the Spanish capital has been a “failure” and that “continuing on the bench for another year would only make his situation worse”.

His representatives are said to be “working on possible destinations to relaunch his career” as Real Madrid “want to close the chapter as soon as possible”. Alexander-Arnold may have already taken in his final appearance for the club, with Arbeloa refusing to reassess his plans.

A brutal decision has come at the worst possible time for Alexander-Arnold, as he had worked his way back into the England squad. His qualities were expected to serve Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel well heading towards the 2026 World Cup. There now appears to be little chance of selection for that tournament being secured.

A hasty return to the Premier League is now being speculated on for Alexander-Arnold, with it suggested that he could retrace steps to Liverpool. He tarnished his reputation in the eyes of some supporters when pushing for an exit, but may be offered the opportunity to rebuild bridges in familiar surroundings.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Cole Palmer sensationally tipped to hand in Chelsea transfer request as Blues legend urges old club to build ‘system and stability' for England star","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/cole-palmer-sensationally-tipped-to-hand-in-chelsea-transfer-request-as-blues-legend-urges-old-club-to-build-system-and-stability-for-england-star/blt6604f9e4c5a24b7b","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 13:50:26 GMT","

Chelsea icon Marcel Desailly has issued a stark warning to his former club, suggesting that talisman Cole Palmer could sensationally hand in a transfer request if he does not believe the Blues can win the Premier League within the next two seasons. The French World Cup winner has urged the Stamford Bridge hierarchy to establish a stable system built specifically around the England international, while simultaneously calling on Palmer to show ""respect"" and ""humility"" to the club's new management.

The future of Palmer has been thrown into doubt following reports that the 23-year-old ""does not particularly enjoy life"" in the capital. Despite a blistering start to his career at Stamford Bridge, where he helped the club secure both the Conference League and Club World Cup titles, Palmer is reportedly ""unsettled"" in London and is struggling with homesickness.

According reports, the star is ""missing his friends back home"" in the north west. This personal dissatisfaction has fuelled speculation that he could be tempted by a homecoming transfer to Manchester City this summer, particularly if the managerial landscape at the Etihad shifts. While Palmer signed a lucrative contract extension in 2024 that keeps him at Chelsea until 2033, the player's happiness off the pitch has become a major talking point as he struggles to replicate his best form during an injury-hit 2025-26 campaign.

The potential for a move is further complicated by the speculation involving Pep Guardiola and former Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca. Maresca, who was sacked by the Blues on New Year's Day, has been heavily linked with the Manchester City job should Guardiola decide to leave at the end of the season.

It has emerged that Maresca had informed Chelsea on three separate occasions that he had held talks with City prior to his dismissal. If the Italian were to take the reins at the Etihad, it could pave the way for Palmer to follow him. The forward enjoyed a prominent role under Maresca, often being deployed in various positions across the attack. A reunion with a manager who trusts him, combined with a return to his home city, could prove an irresistible proposition for a player currently disillusioned with life in London.

Amid the swirling rumours, Chelsea legend Desailly has offered a blunt assessment of the situation. The former World Cup winner believes that professional ambition, rather than just geography, will be the deciding factor. Desailly claims that Palmer will not stick around for a long-term rebuild and has effectively put a two-year deadline on the club's project.

""The question is whether he feels like Chelsea are going to win the Premier League in the next two seasons,"" Desailly told Card Player. ""If he doesn't, I'm sure he will ask for a transfer request to a club that will build a system around him.""

Desailly urged new manager Liam Rosenior to provide the stability Palmer craves. ""I believe Palmer wants more stability and a system that's built for him,"" he explained, noting that the constant tactical shifts under previous coaches may have unsettled him further. ""I would love him to stay at Stamford Bridge because he's got a key role in the team.""

While sympathetic to the need for a better tactical setup, Desailly also challenged Palmer to show resilience and respect for the club that elevated his status. He reminded the youngster that it was Chelsea who gave him the platform to become a star when minutes were hard to come by at City.

""If Cole Palmer decides to move away from Chelsea then that's his business, but I just want him to respect the club, because they are the ones who have given him the tools to become the player he is now,"" Desailly said.

Having suffered with an injury earlier this season, Desailly insists his immediate focus must be on recovery rather than a transfer. ""He still needs to fully recover from his groin injury and get back to full fitness,"" the Frenchman added. ""His recent performances speak for themselves, so he needs to stay humble and come back into the team to help the club, regardless of whether he stays or goes.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Young Man Utd duo who were criticised by former boss Ruben Amorim set to leave Old Trafford on Championship loans","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/young-man-utd-duo-who-were-criticised-by-former-boss-ruben-amorim-set-to-leave-old-trafford-on-championship-loans/blt5fc92a2ee4cf8566","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:33:28 GMT","

Manchester United youngsters Harry Amass and Toby Collyer are set to depart Old Trafford on loan for the remainder of the season, joining Norwich City and Hull City respectively. The duo, who previously faced scrutiny regarding their development paths during Ruben Amorim's tenure, will look to reignite their campaigns in the Championship after being recalled from previous spells earlier this month.

Midfielder Collyer is on the verge of sealing an imminent switch to Hull City, a move that offers a chance at redemption following a frustrating first half of the season. The 22-year-old had been on loan at West Brom but saw his progress stalled by a groin injury and a lack of selection, a situation that drew public criticism from former United boss Amorim in December.

Amorim, who was sacked earlier this month, had highlighted Collyer's struggles as an example of the difficulties United's academy graduates were facing in bridging the gap to senior football. Speaking candidly about the midfielder's situation just weeks before his own departure, Amorim did not mince his words regarding the futility of a loan spell where a player remains on the sidelines.

“I'm always talking about the same thing, Toby [Collyer] and this injury is returning here,” Amorim said in December. “He played, he's from the academy, he played here, went to West Bromwich, he's not playing.”

Defending his use of young players in the first-team, he accused the academy products of being ""entitled"", saying: “We don't need to be always with accolades in everything in every situation, we are not helping. That's why when you guys talk about a lot of players nowadays that they go against the clubs and everything happened because they feel entitlement.
.. I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United. We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled.""

The move to Hull City presents a completely different challenge and environment for Collyer. Unlike his stint at the Hawthorns, he joins a Tigers side firmly in the hunt for automatic promotion. Hull currently sit fourth in the Championship table, just three points adrift of second-placed Ipswich Town. If Collyer can shake off the groin issue that has kept him out since November and break into the side, he could play a pivotal role in a Premier League promotion push.

While Collyer struggled for minutes, 18-year-old left-back Amass enjoyed a far more productive, albeit strange, first half of the campaign. Amass spent the opening months of the season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, where he became a fan favourite. He made 21 appearances, scored one goal, and notably picked up two Player of the Month awards, showcasing the high ceiling that saw him make his senior United debut in March 2025.

Despite his individual success at Hillsborough, Amass returned to Carrington recently and has been awaiting his next step. He is now set to join Norwich City, a club operating at the other end of the table from Collyer's new side. The Canaries are entrenched in a battle for survival but received a massive boost on Tuesday night with a five-goal victory over West Brom - Collyer's former loan club - which lifted them out of the relegation zone.

Amass had attracted interest from several other Championship sides, but the opportunity to secure regular football at Carrow Road appears to have won out. His task will be to provide defensive solidity and attacking flair to a team desperate to distance themselves from the bottom three.

These moves come at a critical juncture for United's player pathway management. The criticism from Amorim regarding the efficacy of the loan system has evidently led to a reshuffle, ensuring that the club's brightest talents are placed in environments where they are not just making up the numbers.

Collyer, who made 13 appearances for the United first team last season under both Erik ten Hag and Amorim, is viewed as a player with significant pedigree. However, at 22, the need for weekly competitive football is paramount. Sitting in the treatment room or on the bench at West Brom was benefiting neither the player nor his parent club.

Similarly, Amass features heavily in United's long-term thinking. Having broken into the first-team setup under Amorim towards the end of the previous season - featuring seven times in the closing months - his development is seen as a priority. The decision to move him from Sheffield Wednesday to Norwich suggests United are meticulously curating his exposure to different tactical demands and pressure situations in the second tier.

For both players, the next six months are definitive. Collyer must prove his fitness and ability to influence games at the top end of the Championship, putting the memory of his stalled West Brom stint and Amorim's harsh words behind him. For Amass, the challenge is consistency; proving that his excellent form at Sheffield Wednesday was not a flash in the pan and that he can adapt quickly to a new club fighting for its life.

With a new era dawning at Old Trafford following Amorim's exit, both players will be keenly aware that their performances in the Championship will be monitored closely by the incoming hierarchy. Success at Hull and Norwich could be the ticket back into the first-team fold for the 2026-27 campaign.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Man Utd drop to eighth in Deloitte Football Money League as Liverpool, Man City and Arsenal lead Premier League clubs in revenue","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/man-utd-drop-deloitte-football-money-league-liverpool-man-city-arsenal-lead-premier-league-clubs-revenue/blt53747f0b26643716","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 11:22:30 GMT","

Manchester United have suffered a historic financial blow, falling to eighth in the Deloitte Football Money League and dropping below rivals Liverpool and Arsenal for the first time in the report's history. The data highlights the severe cost of their nightmare 2024-25 campaign where they finished 15th, marking a new low for the club under the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe.

United's status as a financial superpower has taken a significant battering, with the club plunging to its lowest-ever position in the respected Deloitte Football Money League. For the first time since records began, the Red Devils have been overtaken by both Liverpool and Arsenal, signalling a changing of the guard in English football's financial hierarchy.

According to the data published by the Big Four accounting firm, United have dropped out of the top five revenue-generating clubs entirely, landing in an unprecedented eighth place. While the club accounts show a record turnover of £666.5 million for the 2024-25 season, it was not enough to keep pace with their domestic and European rivals. The stagnation is particularly damning given United have previously topped this league on 10 separate occasions, most recently in 2017.

The report serves as a stark metric of the long-term malaise that has set in under the ownership of the Glazer family and the sporting control of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS. While the commercial machine at Old Trafford remains vast, it is no longer sufficient to mask the deterioration of sporting performance, with the club now firmly looking up at their traditional northwest rivals and London competitors on the balance sheet.

The primary driver behind this financial tumble is the catastrophic 2024-25 season, which is described as the club's worst-ever Premier League campaign. United finished in a humiliating 15th position and suffered further heartbreak by losing the Europa League final to Tottenham. These on-pitch failures have had direct and costly consequences for the bottom line, significantly reducing merit payments and broadcasting revenue.

Crucially, the drop in revenue is exacerbated by the club's failure to qualify for the lucrative Champions League for successive seasons - a nadir not seen since the days of the old European Cup. This absence from Europe's elite table has allowed rivals to surge ahead.

Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who took control of football operations in February 2024, has attempted to stem the bleeding through a ""zero-based budgeting"" policy, which has led to a series of staff redundancies and aggressive cost cuts. However, these efficiency measures have yet to translate into success on the grass. With head coach Ruben Amorim sacked earlier this month and the team currently sitting outside the top four, the fear is that United's slide down the Money League could continue next year if they fail to secure a return to top-tier European football.

In a watershed moment for the Premier League, Liverpool have emerged as the highest-ranked English team. The Merseysiders climbed from eighth last year to fifth overall, posting a record turnover of £702.3m. They are closely followed by Manchester City, who dropped from second to sixth with revenues of £694.1m, and Arsenal, who held steady in seventh with £690.2m.

The report made for chastening reading for the Premier League as a collective. For the first time since Deloitte began measuring these figures almost three decades ago, there are no English teams in the top four. This signals a potential shift in the financial landscape, where the sheer volume of broadcast money in England is no longer guaranteeing global dominance when set against the commercial might and European success of continental giants.

The top of the table is now exclusively the domain of mainland Europe's super-clubs. Real Madrid topped the list for the third consecutive year and a record-extending 15th time, posting a colossal revenue of £975.2m. They were followed by fierce rivals Barcelona (£818.8m), German giants Bayern Munich (£722.9m), and European champions Paris Saint-Germain (£703m).

The widening gap between the European elite and the chasing pack has been attributed to the impact of the expanded Champions League format and the inaugural 32-team Club World Cup. These competitions have provided a significant revenue boost to those involved, leaving clubs like United struggling to keep up. With the next Money League set to analyse the impact of the Premier League's latest television deals, English clubs will be hoping to reclaim lost ground, but for United, the road back to the summit looks longer than ever.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Sargent has generated intense speculation across several windows, with impressive numbers - including 31 goals over the last two seasons - being posted in Norfolk. Many have billed the hard-working 25-year-old as the most complete forward in the Championship.

Unsurprisingly, he is said to have attracted admiring glances from the Premier League. No deal has been done, though, and Sargent remains tied to terms through to the summer of 2028. He is doing all he can to get out of that agreement.

Sargent has effectively gone on strike, with the decision being taken to remove himself from selection contention at Carrow Road. Toronto FC have an offer on the table that will allow him to return to his native North America in a World Cup year.

Ex-USMNT star Friedel can appreciate why Sargent is looking for a move, but - speaking in association with Optimobet - has told GOAL of why he is going about things in the wrong way: “I would say this, Josh is a lovely guy, a really nice guy. I don't think as a player you should ever say you are not playing. That's bad. I don't know if he was advised to do it or if he did it on his own. Bad decision. Never do that. 

“You were happy enough to sign the contract to be at the club at the time. If the club decides to sell you and agrees a fee, I believe it is Toronto that has put the bid in, then great, you can push behind the scenes all you want, have your discussions with the board and the coach, you can tell them you want to go, it's no problem, it happens every day at every football club.

“You have to train and you have to play your games. When players do that, they do not think about the rest of the working staff that is at these clubs. They do not think of the fans that pay the money to come and watch. They do not think about all the auxiliary situations that happen that affect, in a negative way, when you make decisions like that. 

“I understand why he has done it. I understand what his end goal is trying to be. But just like I disagreed with how Isak went about his business in the summer, I disagree with telling a club you are not playing. If they put you on the team sheet, you play. It's pretty simple stuff for me.”

Isak made it clear to Newcastle in 2025 that he would not be playing for them again, allowing him to eventually complete a £125 million ($168m) transfer to Liverpool. In the same window, Sargent had been linked with top-flight teams in England and Germany.

Quizzed on whether he should have held out for that kind of move, or whether heading to MLS is the best option at this stage of his career, Friedel added: “It depends on family life and what is going on in your life. Can MLS compete with the Championship in England and Norwich? You could make that argument. 

“If you are talking about [Weston] McKennie and [Christian] Pulisic, they wouldn't be going to the Championship in England, they would be signed by one of the top eight clubs, I would assume, in the Premier League. It's a completely different argument. 

“If Toronto, who are trying to build another competitive team, see Josh Sargent as the guy and Josh is in a relegation fight in the Championship, I can understand him wanting to go to Toronto. But, I still think if you are called to play or train then you train and you play. The deals will either work out or they won't work out, that's how it is.”

Norwich have been playing hard ball when it comes to a prized asset, with Sargent seeing it made clear to him that a sale will only be sanctioned on the club's terms. He appears destined to pack his bags for MLS at some stage, with a four-and-a-half-year stint in English football being brought to a close with 56 goals recorded through 156 appearances.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Pafos manager bizarrely quizzed on former team-mate David Beckham's public row with son Brooklyn after Champions League defeat to Chelsea","https://www.goal.com/en-ca/lists/pafos-manager-bizarrely-quizzed-team-mate-david-beckham-public-row-son-brooklyn-champions-league-chelsea/blt3e13c6203daf84ee","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 12:13:53 GMT","

Pafos manager Albert Celades was left baffled during his post-match press conference at Stamford Bridge after being asked to comment on the ongoing family feud involving his former team-mate David Beckham. Following his side's narrow 1-0 Champions League defeat to Chelsea, the Spaniard was blindsided by a question regarding the ""saga"" between the Manchester United legend and his son, Brooklyn.

It is standard procedure for managers to face difficult questions after a European defeat, but few could have predicted the curveball thrown at Celades on Wednesday night. Having just watched his Cypriot side produce a spirited display against Premier League giants Chelsea, the former Real Madrid midfielder was expecting inquiries about tactics or the performance of his players.

Instead, the press conference took a surreal detour when a reporter attempted to draw a link between Celades' playing career and current celebrity gossip. ""You obviously played for some time with David Beckham at Real Madrid, have you been following his saga? And what are your thoughts on it?"" the journalist asked.

A clearly confused Celades broke into a smile before responding with a question of his own: ""What is this saga?"" The manager appeared completely unaware of the off-field drama that has dominated the headlines in the UK this week.

The ""saga"" referenced relates to the explosive public falling out between Beckham and his eldest son, Brooklyn. Earlier this week, Brooklyn published a blistering six-page statement on Instagram, launching a stunning attack on his parents, David and Victoria.

In the social media post, Brooklyn accused his parents of controlling narratives about his life, undermining his marriage to Nicola Peltz, and even alleged that his brothers were being ""sent to attack him on social media."" The family dispute has generated widespread comment, but few expected it to filter into the post-match analysis of a Champions League group stage match involving a team from Cyprus.

Realising the bizarre nature of the line of questioning, the Pafos press officer quickly stepped in to shut it down. ""Don't answer this question, I think the question is not relevant to Pafos FC. I am sorry,"" the officer stated firmly.

However, Celades, ever the gentleman, decided to answer the part of the question he understood. ""I don't understand the last word, but we played together, yes,"" he said. When the reporter suggested it was ""probably wise"" not to answer the rest, Celades insisted on paying tribute to his former colleague.

""No, but I have a good memory of him, because we spent time together,"" Celades replied, referencing their time as team-mates at the Bernabeu between 2003 and 2005. ""He was an amazing professional and a very good player of course.""

Before the bizarre exchange, matters on the pitch had been the primary focus. Pafos FC, competing in the Champions League for the first time, gave a credible account of themselves against Liam Rosenior's side.

Despite the vast gap in resources, the visitors restricted Chelsea for long periods. However, they were eventually undone by a solitary goal, with the competition debutants losing narrowly 1-0. While the result leaves them empty-handed, the performance earned Celades plenty of credit - even if his knowledge of the Beckham family drama was somewhat lacking.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Los Blancos remain top of the pile, with their Catalan rivals climbing back up the list, but it's bad news for Manchester United and Manchester City.

The 29th edition of the Deloitte Football Money League has been released and there is plenty of food for thought from a financial perspective as clubs move into 2026.

With broadcast, commercial and matchday revenues taken into account, clubs generated a record €12.4 billion in 2025, with a growth of 11 per cent across the board.

Here, GOAL breaks down the top 20, including the revenue detail and change on the previous year.

Real Madrid lead the 2026 Deloitte Football Money League with a revenue of €1,161 million generated in 2025 - an increase of 11 per cent on their 2024 figure. Los Blancos are closely followed by their Clasico rivals Barcelona, who occupy second place with revenues of €974.8 million.

Following Real and Barca in third place are German giants Bayern Munich, who earned €860.6 million in revenue in 2025. Paris Saint-Germain are in fourth spot, with Liverpool completing the top five.

There has been considerable change from the 2025 list, with Manchester City dropping from second place to sixth, while Manchester United have dropped from fourth to eighth, meaning they sit below Liverpool and Arsenal for the first time in the history of the list.

While Premier League clubs can now mostly be found outside the top five, they still dominate the top 20, accounting for nearly half the clubs on the list. As well as Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal, the other English representatives are Chelsea, Tottenham, Aston Villa, Newcastle and West Ham.

Atletico Madrid are the other Spanish representatives outside of the Clasico duo, while Borussia Dortmund and Stuttgart are Germany's other representatives alongside Bayern. Italy is represented by Inter, AC Milan and Juventus, while the remaining two teams come from France (PSG) and Portugal (Benfica).

Jannik Sinner continued his smooth march toward a potential third straight Australian Open crown on Thursday night, dispatching home favourite James Duckworth 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 with clinical efficiency.

The second seed was relentless throughout, extending his flawless 9-0 record against Australian opponents at Grand Slam events. Sinner faced little trouble on serve, erasing all three break points he encountered, according to Infosys Stats.

“Every match is very difficult, so I'm very happy to be in the next round,” Sinner said in his on-court interview. “I was returning very well today, and my serve was also good, so I'm very happy about my performance. I want to thank you guys [the crowd]. I know I'm not Australian, but you have been very fair to me, so thank you for the support.”

Sealed with an Ace! 👏@janniksin sails into Round 3 with a straight sets win over Duckworth#AusOpen2026 pic.twitter.com/Jw9142vNAu

Sinner booked a third-round clash with American Eliot Spizzirri, and while a showdown with rival and World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz could only come in the final, the Italian couldn't resist a light-hearted nod to the Spaniard when the topic of drop shots arose.

“I think we all know who has the best drop shots… Carlos, of course,” Sinner said of Alcaraz, with whom he has split the past eight major titles.

The No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner is aiming to become just the second man in the Open Era — alongside Novak Djokovic — to lift three consecutive Australian Open trophies.

 When Corentin Moutet steps on a tennis court, you never know quite what to expect. 

 The 26-year-old Frenchman is renowned for the flair and unpredictability of his lefty game. He is a mercurial talent who will on Friday attempt to craft an upset against the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Carlos Alcaraz, in the third round at the Australian Open. 

 Moutet has already shown glimpses of his showmanship this week at Melbourne Park. Stepping up to the line at match point against Tristan Schoolkate in the first round, the Frenchman completed his win by using a shot he has become synonymous with: the underarm serve. 

 “I'm quite happy about the one I did on match point, because I surprised myself doing it,” Moutet told ATPTour.com on Wednesday. “I didn't think about it, [my opponent] was quite close to the baseline, and I still did it.” 

 Underarm serves have in the past been known to cause strong reactions from some players and fans but Moutet, who used the shot six times in one match last June in Mallorca, is clear on his position that how and when the shot is used is key. 

 “If you do it to provoke the crowd, that's different. For myself, I do it when I think I can win the point,” he said. “I'm here on the court to win every point, so I will never do something just for fun. That's not who I am. I respect all my opponents, and I respect the crowd of course even when they are against me, because they bring a great energy and they are here to support someone. 

 “Maybe it's going to change because we are seeing more and more players doing it, because it is efficient and it is working. From my side, I never do it to disrespect anyone. So as long as it works, I am going to keep doing it… I think it saved me a few times. [Like] against Daniil [Medvedev] in Washington last year.” 



 The current No. 37 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Moutet is bidding to back up a personal-best 2025 season in which he earned 33 tour-level wins, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. His Friday clash with Alcaraz will be the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. 

 “I never practised with him and never played against him, so it will be a surprise, I think, even for him,” said Moutet, when asked about how his game style might clash with Alcaraz. “I'm trying not to overthink how it will be. I'm just going to come on the court with my game style, with all the work we did with my team to be ready for these matches. I feel healthy. 

 “Let's see, but for sure it's going to be fun. Nice points, I guess. He is very physical and talented as well, so it's going to be interesting. Let's see how I can deal with it.”

 Moutet will be chasing his third victory against a Top 10 opponent when he steps on Rod Laver Arena to face Alcaraz. Last season, the Frenchman defeated then-No. 10 Holger Rune and then-No. 4 Taylor Fritz at the Queen's Club, but he knows that taking on the current World No. 1, who is bidding to complete the Career Grand Slam by lifting the Australian Open trophy, will likely be another step up. 

 “He's a very nice guy and a great player,"" said Moutet of the Spaniard. ""One of the best, I think along with Jannik [Sinner]. They are the two best players at the moment. I've really wanted to play against him because I want to see the highest level on the Tour. I'm working hard to reach this level, so it's always interesting to see what's going on there and how they play. So I'm curious and very happy to play against him.”

 Marin Cilic reached parity with one of his iconic countrymen after a commanding second-round performance on Thursday at the Australian Open. 

 With his 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 triumph against Denis Shapovalov at Melbourne Park, the 37-year-old Cilic earned his 599th tour-level victory, drawing him level with former World No. 2 and 2001 Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic for the most wins by a Croatian man in the Open Era. 

 “I think it is an incredible achievement for any Croatian,” Cilic told ATPTour.com in Melbourne. “I know Goran. When I was working with him he said, ‘Nobody told me I had 599. I would have played another one!'. We were laughing. 

 “Just fantastic to be in this position. Obviously different careers, different times. We are both different kind of players. But also in order to achieve this number of victories you have to be so consistent for so many years. So it's a great achievement for a Croatian.” 

 Cilic, himself a former No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings and a Grand Slam titlist at the 2014 US Open, can hit another milestone on Saturday in Melbourne. He will bid to surpass Ivanisevic and notch his 600th tour-level win when he faces 12th seed Casper Ruud or Jaume Munar. The Croatian would become just the second active player to hit 600 wins after Novak Djokovic.

Novak Djokovic cruised to a convincing second-round victory Thursday at the Australian Open, where the record 10-time champion downed Francesco Maestrelli 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.


Playing just his second match since winning his 101st tour-level title in Athens in November, the 38-year-old moved efficiently as ever and struck the ball cleanly throughout the afternoon, a positive sign for the Serbian's form in the early stages of the tournament.

“It did feel like two completely different tournaments playing at night [round one] and day today, particularly with the wind that I think has been blowing this year more than any other year that I've been playing here in Australia,” Djokovic said of the conditions. “I have to adjust to that and adapt to a different opponent with a big serve, but overall it's good. I'm pleased with the way I'm moving and hitting the ball.”


Djokovic, who claimed his 100th match win at the Australian Open in the opening round, needed seven set points to clinch the 47-minute opener. Rarely relinquishing control in baseline rallies, Djokovic will be pleased with his dominant serving display, having won 86 per cent (43/50) of his first-serve points.


When faced with two break points in his opening service game of the second set, Djokovic drew forehand return errors from the 23-year-old qualifier, who before the match called his clash against the 24-time major titlist “one of the most exciting things of my life”.


Djokovic is now one win shy of 400 victories at Slam level. Should he defeat his next opponent, Botic van de Zandschulp or Shang Juncheng, Djokovic will become the first player to record 400 major match wins. Van de Zandschulp stunned Djokovic last year at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Indian Wells, tying their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1. Djokovic has never faced Shang.


Making his 21st appearance at Melbourne Park, Djokovic is seeded to meet Italian Lorenzo Musetti in the quarter-finals and two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner in the last four. 


Musetti flew past countryman Lorenzo Sonego 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 to match his career-best result at the season's first major. The fifth seed created 23 break chances, converting six, according to Infosys Stats. Musetti, 23, will next meet 31st seed Stefanos Tsitsipas or Czech Tomas Machac.

For the first time since the 2009 US Open, five teenagers are into the third round of a major. Mirra Andreeva, Iva Jovic, Victoria Mboko, Tereza Valentova and Nikola Bartunkova all advanced to the Round of 32 at the Australian Open.

Five teenagers have advanced to the third round of the Australian Open, the most at a major since the 2009 US Open.

Mirra Andreeva, 18, is the highest-ranked of the five. She's joined by 29th seed Iva Jovic, also 18, and 19-year-old Victoria Mboko.

Tereza Valentova, 18, is also into the third round -- her best-ever result at a Grand Slam -- after knocking off 30th seed Maya Joint in the first round and Linda Fruhvirtova in her most recent match.

The most surprising teenager to make the Round of 32, though, is 19-year-old Nikola Bartunkova. Playing a Grand Slam for the first time in her career, the World No. 126 won three matches to qualify for the main draw before upsetting Daria Kasatkina and stunning Belinda Bencic. Bencic, the No. 10 seed, came into the match as arguably the hottest player on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, having won her last 12 matches.

""It's a dream come true,"" an overjoyed Bartunkova said after the 6-3, 0-6, 6-4 win.

A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen)

Of the five teens, only Andreeva will be favored in her third-round match. She'll play World No. 79 Elena-Gabriela Ruse.

Mboko will take on 14th seed Clara Tauson, and Jovic is set to meet two-time Grand Slam finalist Jasmine Paolini. Valentova will play WTA Finals champion Elena Rybakina for the second time -- Rybakina won their first meeting, at last year's US Open -- and Bartunkova will look to keep her dream run alive against 21st seed Elise Mertens.

""I know she's very aggressive,"" Mboko said of Tauson, who she'll be playing for the first time. ""She's ranked really high for a reason. I know it's going to be another battle on Friday. She's a hard hitter, and I'm really looking forward to it.""

The last five teens to make it to the third round, at the 2009 US Open, were 19-year-olds Petra Kvitova, Caroline Wozniacki, Yanina Wickmayer and Sorana Cirstea, and 17-year-old Melanie Oudin.

Seventeen years later, Cirstea -- now 35 -- made it into the second round of the Australian Open, beating Eva Lys in her opener before falling to Naomi Osaka in a tense three-setter. Cirstea is planning to retire at the end of the year.

Tested for the second straight round, Naomi Osaka raised her level late to outlast Sorana Cirstea in a three-set Australian Open second-round encounter.

Clad once again in her aquamarine, jellyfish-inspired outfit, Naomi Osaka showed that it was the timing of her sting that mattered the most. For the second round in a row, she was taken to three sets. For the second match in a row, she elevated her level when she needed to, pulling away from Sorana Cirstea 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 in exactly two hours.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The matchup revived a piece of unfinished business from early in Osaka's career. Back in 2015, a 17-year-old Osaka made her Grand Slam qualifying debut at Wimbledon, only to be drawn against Cirstea -- then a former Top 30 player on the comeback trail from injury. Cirstea won that encounter 2-6, 6-1, 6-4 -- and then, remarkably, the pair did not meet again until this week.

Cirstea, who has announced that 2026 will be her final season on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, put Osaka under pressure immediately as she took a 2-0 lead. But Osaka responded with a brilliant, high-intensity stretch of play to take six of the next seven games. Highlights included an angled backhand pass on the run to break Cirstea back early on, and a superb backhand volley at full stretch to save break point against her in the final game of the set -- one of a perfect seven out of seven points Osaka won at net.

Undaunted, the No. 41-ranked Cirstea hit back in the second set despite once again losing an early break lead. At 3-3, the 35-year-old saved a pair of break points against her and pounced as Osaka lapsed into error while serving to stay in the set.

It was only a brief lapse. The Osaka forehand was quickly on song again at the start of the third as she broke Cirstea with a number of winners from that wing. After an off-court medical timeout with Osaka leading 2-1, the match grew more tense, but the former World No. 1 stayed in control. She struck 38 winners, including three aces, to Cirstea's 10 and saved five of eight break points. 

Tensions surfaced late in the third set. Serving at 4-2, 30-30, Cirstea objected to the umpire about Osaka's “c'mon” between first and second serves. Play resumed with Cirstea sending two forehands long, giving Osaka a double break. The two exchanged words at the net after Osaka served out the match.

A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen)

Asked what it had taken to get through the match in her on-court interview, Osaka responded: ""Apparently a lot of c'mons that she was angry about,"" before raising her hands skyward.

""I mean, I tried to play well. I think I did a lot of unforced errors, but I tried my best. She's a great player; I think this was her last Australian Open, so ... sorry she was mad about it.""

Better vibes were to be found in the crowd, where two fans had wasted no time in creating their own versions of the butterfly-ornamented hat and veil that Osaka had worn for her Tuesday walk-on. The four-time major champion gave them a shoutout in her on-court interview.

""I don't really talk that much, but I like to express myself through clothes,"" she said. ""I'm really glad you guys loved it -- you guys look really cool, by the way.""

A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen)

Later, both Osaka and Cirstea sought to downplay the incident in their respective press conferences.

""I have been playing for 20 years,"" Cirstea said. ""It's more than going on than a five-second discussion at the end that I had with Naomi. We just had a chat. Nothing big. Again, I don't think that's the main thing after tonight's match. Again, it was a good match. She was much better than me towards the end. Yeah, she deserved the win.""

Osaka also lowered the temperature in the press room.

I don't like disrespecting people. That's not what I do. ... But when I'm pumping myself up, in my head I'm not like, 'OK, now I'm going to distract the other person.' It's purely for me.""

Osaka will next face the last remaining home hope in the women's draw, Australian qualifier Maddison Inglis, as she bids to return to the Australian Open fourth round for the first time since her 2021 title run.

Not only did Iga Swiatek extend her perfect record against Marie Bouzkova with a 6-2, 6-3 victory on Thursday night, but she also improved to 24-0 in Grand Slam second rounds in the 2020s.

Iga Swiatek arrived on court Thursday night in Melbourne with several streaks on the line. Chief among them: extend her perfect record against Marie Bouzkova to 3-0, ideally in straight sets once again.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

That second part looked shaky when she fell behind by a break in the second set, but the No. 2 seed never truly appeared in danger of losing the match, closing out a 6-2, 6-3 win in 1 hour and 19 minutes.

“It felt great playing today,” Swiatek said in her on-court interview. “I felt more free than in my first round, so I really wanted to go for it. And for sure, the conditions also weren't easy. I don't know if you guys feel that, but on the court it's super windy.

“So I needed to adjust for that, and I'm really happy with the performance for sure.”

The victory sent her into the Australian Open third round for the seventh straight year. She has now reached the third round at 24 consecutive Grand Slam events; her last second-round exit came at the 2019 US Open, where she lost to Anastasija Sevastova.

With the result, Swiatek became the first WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz player in the Open Era to reach the Round of 32 at the first 24 women's singles Grand Slam events of a single decade.

Here's how she got it done:

On the approach: At one point early in the second set, Swiatek was a perfect 9-for-9 winning points when approaching the net, a clear weapon for the World No. 2, who repeatedly used forward movement to take control of rallies.

She incorporated this tactic immediately, creeping toward the net before firing a backhand winner by Bouzkova to hold for 1-0. She followed the same blueprint to guide her to a 4-1 hold, affording her a lead she would only build on before claiming the first set in 38 minutes.

Fittingly, she ended the match with one final approach, this time finishing it with a forehand winner to seal the win.

Tour's best frontrunner: That forehand was one of 31 winners Swiatek hit (compared to just three from Bouzkova), many coming after she built comfortable leads in each set. There's a saying that fits her game well: give an inch, take a mile. Because, if an opponent offers even a sliver of space, Swiatek tends to take far more.

Exhibit A: the second set. Bouzkova broke for a 2-1 lead and consolidated for 3-1 but left the door open just a crack. Swiatek burst through, converting her third break point of the game to level at 3-3.

In all, she reeled off five straight games to finish the match, taking the lead and never looking back.

Give an inch, take a mile.

What's next: Swiatek will face No. 31 seed Anna Kalinskaya in the third round. 

She leads their head-to-head 2-1, losing in Dubai last season, but winning their two most recent meetings in Cincinnati and at the US Open in straight sets.

A third win in a row would send her to the Australian Open fourth round for the sixth time and keep alive her bid to complete the career Grand Slam with a title in Melbourne.

Not only did Iga Swiatek extend her perfect record against Marie Bouzkova with a 6-2, 6-3 victory on Thursday night, but she also improved to 24-0 in Grand Slam second rounds in the 2020s.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

MELBOURNE, Australia—Naomi Osaka's Australian Open second round ended awkwardly on Thursday when vanquished opponent Sorana Cirstea gave a frosty handshake after her 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 win.Cirstea, who previously announced that the 2026 season would be her last before retirement, accused Osaka of talking between serves, but was reluctant to discuss the issue in her post-match press conference.""Is this the big thing that happened tonight?"" she asked.""There was no drama.

Ruud had dominated his head-to-head with Munar going into their match on Thursday night, 5-1, and things went much the same way this time, as the Norwegian was never broken in 16 service games—he only faced two break points the entire match, and they were in the same game, when he was already up two sets to love and ahead by a break at 2-1 in the third set.And he ended up holding serve in that game, anyway.He then broke once per set to claim a straight-set victory, finishing the match with a clean 35 winners to 35 unforced errors.Awaiting the No. 12-seeded Ruud in the third round will be resurgent veteran Marin Cilic, who knocked out No. 21-seeded Denis Shapovalov in straight sets earlier in the day, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.Ruud has won all four of their previous meetings, including their only career meeting at a Grand Slam tournament, a 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 victory in the semifinals of Roland Garros in 2022.

MELBOURNE, Australia—Where most players are eager to make the most of their off-season, Clara Tauson wanted to keep playing.The world No. 14 was coming off a breakthrough year during which she reached her first WTA 1000 final at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships and followed it up with another semifinal later that summer at the Omnium Banque Nationale in Montréal. Falling victim to the FOMO that inspired a jam-packed 2025 tournament schedule, she got straight back to work in the hopes of maintaining that momentum into the new year.“I was working really hard, and I think I maybe started a bit too early and didn't take my time after the season ended,” Tauson told me at the Australian Open on Wednesday. “I was just so ready to get out there and practice that I got a little bit sick and had some issues here and there.”Those issues led to a bumpy start to this season and a mid-match retirement from the Adelaide International just last week.

“That was more of a precaution because I didn't feel too well against Ajla [Tomljanovic] or in my first match in Brisbane,” she explained. “I had a little bit of trouble in the first two tournaments, but the rest that I got after retiring was needed.“You try to work on everything in the off-season because you don't really have time when we're on tour, so it wasn't the perfect pre-season but I really worked hard on just everything.”Tauson immediately put her fitness to the test over three long sets against Polina Kudermetova, shaking off a lost a 5-3 lead in the final set to reach the third round of the Australian Open for a third straight season.“The physios have been taking great care of me and I feel great,” said Tauson. “I played three hours of doubles yesterday and 7-5 in the third today without any troubles, so I'm really happy about that.“She plays a really fast game, which is hard to read sometimes. I tried to just play focused and hope she'd make a few mistakes. In the end, I felt like I was playing better than her but at 5-4 I got a little nervous and she played good. After that, I just told myself I need to go for it. She's not going to give it to me, and it worked.”

I think I like to have two or three shots and then I go for it, Many of the players, they play really fast from the beginning, which is a game I should be used to because they're so many Russians and Europeans who play that kind of game. You even see [Amanda] Anisimova, she plays like that so hard from the first shot. Clara Tauson

Her description of Kudermetova's tennis as “boom boom boom” was an interesting one coming from a player considered to be one of the biggest hitters on tour but according to Tauson, her aggression is more tactical.“I think I like to have two or three shots and then I go for it,” she said with a smile. “Many of the players, they play really fast from the beginning, which is a game I should be used to because they're so many Russians and Europeans who play that kind of game. You even see [Amanda] Anisimova, she plays like that so hard from the first shot.“I think today, I really tried to stay focused even though she played so fast on many shots, I felt I was giving her one extra shot all the time.”

“I think today, I really tried to stay focused even though she played so fast on many shots, I felt I was giving her one extra shot all the time.”

Still, Tauson would hardly consider her best game to be one that requires too much retrieving, and too much defense could spell disaster in her next match against No. 17 seed Victoria Mboko.The rising Canadian star is coming off a breakthrough season of her own, having won her first WTA 1000 title at the Omnium Banque Nationale.“She's obviously great,” said Tauson. “I think she has a very all-around game: she can serve, she can return, she plays fast, and she's really solid. She's winning a lot of matches and in a good flow, but she's going to have to beat me, and I'll go out there and do my best.”Though she claims to find peace knowing there's always another tournament around the corner, Tauson will surely look to max out at the majors this year as she aims to make a first Grand Slam quarterfinal in 2026.

On the eve of the Australian Open, Ethan Quinn was a loser. The 21-year-old American drew the metaphorical short straw after a game of ""credit-card roulette"" during a night out with many of the other U.S. men in the singles field in Melbourne, and was left paying the group's $2,500 tab at Nobu.But nearly a week later, the 21-year-old is showing why he's earned his seat at the table.The former NCAA champion, ranked No. 80, is through the the third round Down Under for the first time. After defeating No. 23 seed Tallon Griekspoor, who topped Quinn twice last year, in straight sets in the first round, he beat the in-form Hubert Hurkacz on Thursday also in three sets to match the best-ever major result of his young career so far.""I think each Slam you get to experience something different,"" Quinn, who also won two matches at Roland Garros last year, said after defeating Hurkacz. ""You know, first time making third round here. First time winning a Slam match here. ...  I'm still trying to make sure that awe moment doesn't leave every time you make a deep run.""

In 2023, Quinn won the NCAA singles title and turned professional a month later. But he only broke into the Top 200 for the first time in 2025, confessing last year that he needed a ""reality check"" about just what it would take to become a successful professional. His rise over the last year earned him not just a spot in the world's Top 100, but an invitation to at what's become a traditional bonding experience for American men in Melbourne.Read more: After ""reality check,"" Ethan Quinn starts to meet his expectations""It's growing a lot,"" Taylor Fritz says of the gathering, which he estimates began in 2018.

""I don't have every American guy's number. And there's new guys that come up. So I put six or seven of the guys in the group chat, and everyone is invited. I'm getting the big table.

""You're making money out here, you will be all right,"" joked Frances Tiafoe, who didn't make it to the night out because he was playing his opening match on Sunday.

MELBOURNE, Australia—In between press conferences at the 2026 Australian Open, Ben Shelton released an interview of his own on his official YouTube channel, one that chronicled his off-season and prep for the summer Down Under.“I've kind of been excited to be able to tell my story a little bit,” Shelton told me after his second-round win on Thursday, “and have people see, especially in this episode, some of the off-court stuff, the behind the scenes, in the off-season, away from tournament life.”With help from a WME production team, Shelton debuted the series, entitled The Long Game, back in December after ending the 2025 season with a first appearance at the Nitto ATP Finals post in Turin.“If I was, like, traveling around with a big crew with a bunch of, like, equipment and big cameras, that's not something I would be comfortable with, but we've found a way to do it with the minimal amount of people and still make it look good,” explained the No. 8 seed.

“My camera guy, he's a good friend. He's like a fly on the wall. You don't even notice that he's there sometimes. He gets clips [and] I didn't even realize he was recording!”Shelton has become TikTok's favorite tennis player since his rise up the ATP rankings, in combination due to his effusive on-court celebrations and some of the dances he's roped into performing alongside girlfriend Trinity Rodman.“I think I'm good at following direction and whatever dances that Trinity wants to do. I don't do every one, but I feel like I do a good bit of them when she asks me to. It's not my thing, but…” he trailed off with a laugh.Shelton is the latest player to embrace the documentary format, a trend 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic believes is the cost of doing business in the current online economy.“We're living in a world today of digital media,” Djokovic said after joining Shelton in the third round with a straight-sets win over Francesco Maestrelli. “The communication of the brand happens pretty much only through digital and social media channels.

That's very individual.“I don't judge. Everyone has their own likings.

I know that it's a new thing in Turkey, but I don't want to stop here. I want to keep going. I want to do better things.

The atmosphere surrounding the 23-year-old on Court 7 at Melbourne Park was unlike any setting she had been a part of.“I felt like I was at home. I was feeling the energy. It was really unreal. I really, really appreciate it,” she told press. “I felt very good on the court. I really felt the support, and I felt like we were all playing together, actually.“At first I couldn't even hear my own thoughts. It was very, very loud. Then I said, ‘Zeynep, just focus, just you and the ball, play your game and just focus on the court.'“I have never experienced something like this.”

“I have never experienced something like this.”

Having dropped outside of the Top 100 on the year-end WTA rankings, Sonmez will undoubtedly return following the season's first major—with a win in the next round likely to vault her past a career-high mark of No. 69.It would, of course, also bring Sonmez into uncharted territory: the second week of a major. Crediting the compatriots that came before her, including Marsel Ilhan and Cagla Buyukakcay, for paving the way and offering their mentorship, Sonmez isn't lacking support with breaking further ground for her nation.“They're always trying to help me with their experiences. I want to do better,” she says.“I know that it's a new thing in Turkey, but I don't want to stop here. I want to keep going. I want to do better things.”For a coveted spot in the round of 16, Sonmez takes on Yulia Putintseva. The Kazakh cruised past Elsa Jacquemot, 6-1, 6-2.

MELBOURNE, Australia—Stan Wawrinka has turned the nostalgia vibes all the way up at the 2026 Australian Open this week, reaching the third round to kick off what will likely be his final season on tour.At 40 years old, the 2014 champion turned back the clock to outlast Frances Arthur Gea in five grueling sets, 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 7-6 (10-3) and enjoy his best run at a Grand Slam tournament since the 2023 US Open.But on the court, his outfit was as much a tribute to his illustrious career as his game on Thursday, the Swiss veteran donning a shirt that pays tribute to the plaid Yonex shorts in which he won the 2015 Roland Garros title.Very few players could successfully reference a look they wore over a decade ago, but Wawrinka was nonetheless reticent to endorse the idea that those shorts were a part of tennis' fashion continuum:

Q. If I can ask about the small detail on your shirt that seems to be a tribute to the shorts you wore at the French Open. Fashion history, what does it mean to be a little part of that?STAN WAWRINKA: I'm not part of fashion history. People remember that short because it was not the best-looking short. Also because I did won the French Open. That's why we talk so much about it.No, I'm happy with the clothes I'm having right now. I think they're good. I'm happy to wear them.Fans were undoubtedly heartened to see the shoutout, a recognition to their years supporting the former world No. 3, and they will have another shot to see Wawrinka on court in Melbourne as he prepares to take on No. 9 seed Taylor Fritz for the chance to reach a first Grand Slam fourth round since he made the quarterfinals of this very tournament in 2020.

Temple details McLaren preparations ahead of new 2026 regulations

The wait is nearly over for the new series of Formula 1: Drive to Survive, with Netflix confirming the release date for Season 8.

With just weeks to go until the 2026 campaign begins, the perfect pre-season watch will soon be here as Netflix have confirmed the release date for the brand-new series of Formula 1: Drive to Survive.

Season 8 of the hit series – set to arrive on the streaming platform on February 27 – will again give fans a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the 2025 campaign, a year that saw plenty of action unfold both on and off the track.

The battle for the Drivers' Championship took several twists and turns, with Oscar Piastri establishing himself as an early favourite before Max Verstappen embarked on a remarkable resurgence in the second half, the Dutchman putting himself right back into the fight.

While Piastri faced a tough spell, McLaren team mate Lando Norris looked in increasingly strong form as the year progressed, and the Briton went on to win a maiden World Championship by just two points at the Abu Dhabi season finale.

Elsewhere there was a closely-fought scrap in the midfield, while various stories hit the headlines away from the circuit.

The latest series of Drive to Survive will be released just before the 2026 season begins, with the Australian Grand Prix kicking off a 24-round calendar on March 6-8.

Stella explains McLaren approach to 2026 with every team starting ‘from zero' 

Temple details McLaren preparations ahead of new 2026 regulations

F1 technical expert Mark Hughes gives his initial take on the Mercedes W17 design.

The renders Mercedes have released of their new W17 challenger show a distinctive design – especially around the rear three-quarters – with a lower bodywork that kinks upwards at the rear.

This is in stark contrast to the extreme downwash bodyworks on the other 2026 cars that we have seen thus far. However, this is a computerised render and not the real thing, so it's difficult to try to read too much into it.

Other notable points are the retention of pushrod front suspension (Mercedes were in the minority in using front pushrod last year), which seems to be the common choice of teams for the 2026 regulations.

It's notable that the pushrod is intrinsically lighter for the same strength and this is probably a significant driver of that move as everyone struggles to get down to the lowered 770kg minimum weight.

With the platform of these flat-bottom cars no longer needing to be as stiff as those of the ground-effect era machines, the ride heights are expected to be greater and we will probably see the return of using some dive under braking to bring forward the centre of aero pressure into slow corners to counter the natural low-speed understeer. As such, the pullrod installation's inherently greater stiffness control is no longer as valuable.

The nose mounts to the middle element of the three-element front wing via pillars, leaving a big slot beneath with which to feed airflow to the underfloor. With the reduction in underfloor downforce arising from deleting the venturi floor tunnels, rear downforce generation is going to be at more of a premium than before. Mercedes appear to be committing heavily to this.

On the renders, the floor board ahead of the sidepod – a new part of the regulation intending to force teams to in-wash the front wheel wake into the floor rather than out-washing it for greater aero effectiveness, but a more disruptive wake for the car behind – looks to be fully committing to in-washing with the alignment of the vanes.

Looking at the VCARB which tested at Imola, it appears as if that team is trying to minimise the in-wash in the way it has aligned the permitted three vanes within the boards. This would seem more logical, but again this may not be representative of the actual W17 when it breaks cover on its shakedown at Silverstone.

Other things to check when the real car breaks cover include whether the sidepod/engine cover really is as flat in profile as the render makes it appear – or whether the heavy downwash which is the more obvious reaction to the new regulations will be incorporated also on the W17.

If the real car indeed has this sidepod/engine cover arrangement and the committed in-washing floor boards, then there will be many seeking to understand how Mercedes have chosen to resolve the conflicting demands of the new regulations.

Have they pioneered a left-field solution, or is this just a case of deliberately misleading renders?

Mercedes have unveiled the first images of their 2026 challenger, featuring a new livery in their iconic colours.

Mercedes have revealed the first images of their 2026 challenger, which features a revised livery in their iconic silver and black colours.

The Silver Arrows, who fought back to finish second in the Teams' Championship last year, will run an unchanged line-up of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli this season.

The W17, like all its rivals, will be smaller, narrower and lighter than its predecessor as it has been designed and built to sweeping new aerodynamic regulations.

“Formula 1will undergo significant change in 2026, and we are prepared for that transition,"" said Team Principal and CEO Toto Wolff.

""The new regulations demand innovation and absolute focus across every area of performance.

""Our work on the new car, and the long-term development of the Power Unit and advanced sustainable fuels with Petronas, reflects that approach.

""Releasing the first images of the W17 is simply the next step in that process.

""It represents the collective, sustained effort of our teams in [their Power Unit base in] Brixworth and [chassis base in] Brackley. We will continue to push hard in the months ahead.""

Mercedes will join the rest of the teams in Spain next week for the five-day Barcelona Shakedown.

The eight-time world champions will then host a season launch event with their drivers, senior personnel and the W17 on February 2.

Afterwards, the squad will then head to Bahrain for official pre-season testing, with two three-day tests planned for teams to refine their cars and start to chase performance.

The immersive experience, Formula 1 Exhibition, opens its doors to the public in Mexico City on 20 March 2026.

Formula 1 fever will start early this year in Mexico City, when the internationally acclaimed and award-winning immersive experience, Formula 1 Exhibition opens its doors to the public on 20 March 2026 at the iconic Yama Punta Museo.

Mexico City becomes the ninth city and second location in Latin America after Buenos Aires to host F1 Exhibition. The global tour first premiered in Madrid, Spain, where it became the country's top selling temporary exhibition in 2023, before highly popular tours in Vienna and London, where it was awarded “Best Visitor Experience” at the 2024 Access All Areas Awards.

The revered show has also visited Toronto, Oberhausen in Germany, Amsterdam and most recently in Melbourne, Australia where the show made its Asia Pacific debut.

With the Mexico City Grand's Prix festival-like atmosphere, Mexico has developed a love and passion for Formula 1, amassing 48 million fans. The Grand Prix has sold out every year since its return to the calendar, and fans can expect another incredible event in 2026 when local hero Sergio Perez returns to the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez for his first home Grand Prix since 2024 with F1's newest team Cadillac.

The Formula 1 Exhibition Mexico City will offer these devoted fans, and those new to the sport, the chance to experience Formula 1 away from the track, gaining a rare front-row seat to one of the world's fastest-growing sports.

Delivering a storytelling experience across six specially designed rooms spanning more than 2,000 square meters and developed in collaboration with award-winning curators, artists, and filmmakers, the Exhibition offers a unique insight into the extraordinary world of Formula 1.

The Mexico City edition will see the return of the show's popular experiences as well as a new local room unique for the capital that will celebrate the country's iconic track and its local heroes, including Mexico's most successful driver Perez.

Fans will also get to experience Pit Wall, a spectacular cinematic and immersive experience that allows fans to relive the greatest moments in Formula 1 history like never before.

They'll also get to journey to Once Upon A Time In Formula 1, a gallery showcasing never-before-seen photography, historic F1 cars, audiovisual content, and original artefacts, transporting audiences through the most iconic moments that have defined the sport.

In Design Lab, visitors step inside the heart of a Formula 1 factory to discover how teams design and build their cars each season. Drivers & Duels will celebrate the sport's most iconic drivers, legendary rivalries, and historic races since Formula 1 began in 1950.

Fallen Heroes is a room that pays tribute to the drivers who lost their lives in pursuit of glory at the pinnacle of the sport, while Survival explores Romain Grosjean's dramatic 2020 Bahrain crash. This gallery features the remains of his Haas race car alongside a multi-screen audiovisual installation with exclusive interviews and previously unseen footage of the incident.

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer at Formula 1, said: “Since Formula 1 Exhibition's debut in Madrid in 2023, the show has gone from strength to strength to attract over 1 million visitors. We are excited to continue to bring the story and history of Formula 1 to our fans and those new to the sport.

""Mexico City is a vibrant cultural hub with a true passion for motorsport, so it made perfect sense for it to be the next stop on the Latin American tour.”

Jonathan Linden, Co-CEO of Round Room Live and Producer of The Formula 1 Exhibition said: “We are delighted to announce Mexico City as the next host city of The Formula 1 Exhibition.

""Each edition recognises the local heritage and local heroes of its host location, and this will be no exception, celebrating the region's deep connection to Formula 1.”

Doriane Pin will provide even more support to the Mercedes F1 operation in 2026 as she expands her role.

F1 ACADEMY champion Doriane Pin is increasing her duties with the Mercedes F1 team as she becomes one of their Development Drivers for 2026.

French racer Pin, 22, graduates from the team's Junior Programme to form part of Mercedes' roster of drivers who work across simulator development and carry out activities at the factory and trackside.

She will attend several Grands Prix for the squad, while acting as a support and sounding board to Mercedes' 2026 F1 ACADEMY driver – dovetailing these responsibilities with a soon-to-be-announced racing programme.

Pin beat Ferrari-backed rival Maya Weug to last year's F1 ACADEMY crown with four wins and four further podiums across seven rounds, and will collect her trophy at Wednesday evening's Autosport Awards in London.

“I'm very proud and grateful to take on the role of Development Driver with the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team,” said Pin.

“My two years as part of the Junior Programme have helped me grow as a driver and this is a fantastic next step in my career. I'm excited to keep working with everyone at Brackley and Brixworth and progressing toward future opportunities, both on and off track.

“I also want to say a big thank you to everyone at F1 Academy in helping me reach this position. The series provides a brilliant platform for female drivers, and I am honoured to be collecting the championship trophy this evening.

“As I continue my own journey in motorsport, I know there will be more incredible women following in my wheel tracks and I wish them all the very best of luck for the season ahead.”

Bradley Lord, Mercedes Team Representative, commented: ""We are delighted to announce that Doriane will step up to the role of Development Driver in 2026.

“In her two years within our F1 Academy team, she combined dedication, speed, and race-craft with strong technical feedback and engineering knowledge – culminating in her championship success last season.

“These skills are vital to progress up the motorsport ladder and this new role will help Doriane continue to grow and develop as a driver on her motorsport journey.

“Her success in F1 Academy, and the opportunity the series presents, has prepared her well for this next step and we're excited to see her tackle it alongside a soon-to-be-announced racing programme.”

Stella explains McLaren approach to 2026 with every team starting ‘from zero' 

Temple details McLaren preparations ahead of new 2026 regulations

McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella has explained why the squad will continue to use their ‘papaya rules' approach for Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in 2026.

Andrea Stella has reaffirmed that McLaren will continue to provide “equal opportunities” to both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in 2026, with the Team Principal stating that the squad will “keep racing the McLaren way”.

The Woking-based outfit became known for their ‘papaya rules' last season, an approach that focuses on treating both drivers fairly. While the strategy occasionally faced external criticism on the occasions where it backfired, it is one that the team are sticking with going forward.

Reflecting on this ahead of the MCL40 first hitting the track at the upcoming Barcelona Shakedown, Stella praised the squad's drivers for their support on the matter as he explained: “We talked last year quite a bit about internal racing at McLaren, so let me say that from that point of view, we will enter 2026 with continuity.

“We will keep racing the McLaren way. If we have been able to achieve success in 2024 and then in 2025, what has added extra value to what we have achieved is the way in which we have achieved in such a collaborative, supportive way – [a] cohesive way – together with our drivers.

“I actually [came here] straight from a meeting with Oscar, and before I was having lunch with Lando. The 2026 season is already fully on, even in terms of how much the drivers are engaged, and I was particularly pleased to see how energetic, proactive, full of ideas, but also full of support to the way we have gone racing the McLaren way in the past. So that's the perspective of going into 2026 racing from a team point of view.”

Despite this, Stella acknowledged that there may be ways in which the team “streamline” their approach, having tried to learn from the areas that they could improve on from last season.

“I can certainly say that like anything that we approach at McLaren, we go through a thorough process of review such that we can see where are the opportunities to improve, and this was the same for what we call the racing principles and the way we go racing and internal competition,” the Italian said.

“We got quite a lot of feedback already during the season last year. We had conversations after the season and we are having conversations pretty much as we speak now.

“All this has led us to reaffirm fundamentally, like I said before, that the concepts of fairness, integrity, equal opportunities, sportsmanship, they are all fundamental for the team, for Lando and for Oscar. So they are reaffirmed, they are confirmed and consolidated, if anything.

“At the same time, we all acknowledge that the volume of work required, for instance, for the team and to some extent even for the drivers related to internal competition was important.

“Therefore, any attempt we can make to make this going racing together just simpler to some extent will be welcome. It will be in reality a matter of finetuning because, once we reviewed what we have done, in most of the cases we said that's exactly what we would still do again.

“But we found a few opportunities in which we can streamline the way in which we operate collectively – like I said, reaffirming the fundamental principles that we have adopted in the past.”

Temple details McLaren preparations ahead of new 2026 regulations

Having acknowledged that Red Bull could face some teething issues as they begin running their own power units, Laurent Mekies says that Max Verstappen is “aware of the risk-taking”.

Laurent Mekies has shared an insight into how Red Bull can keep Max Verstappen onboard should the team face early struggles in 2026 as they begin manufacturing their own power units for the first time.

At the recent launch of the squad's new livery in Detroit – a city chosen as the host location due to it being known as the United States home of Ford, the squad's partner on Red Bull Ford Powertrains – Mekies acknowledged that there may be “a fair amount of headaches and sleepless nights” initially, adding: “We will eventually come out on top. Bear with us in the first few months.”

As such, the Team Principal was quizzed during a discussion at the Autosport Business Exchange on whether the Milton Keynes-based outfit will be able to keep Verstappen content should success not arrive in the first year of the project – to which he suggested that the Dutchman is “aware of the scale of the challenge”.

“I think we got that question pretty much every race last year!” Mekies joked. “I will expect us to get it also every race this year. But seriously, one of the many incredible things with Max is that he's not sitting outside of the project, watching what we do and judging what we do.

“He is in the project. He takes the risk with us – he's aware of the risk taking. He's aware that we take risks, as do Ford. He's aware of the scale of the challenge. He lives and breathes motorsport, more than a large part of us.

“He is motorsport – he is day and night thinking motor racing. If it's not Formula 1, it's the GT3; if it's not the GT3, it's the virtual races – whatever he comes up with next.”

Verstappen has previously admitted that, when considering his options for the future, there are “a lot of things that have to come together” should he consider making a change, with the four-time World Champion stating that “it's not only about F1”.

Pushed on what Red Bull can do to keep the 28-year-old interested and invested, Mekies answered: “You know, it's a fair point. We think Max wants a fast car, so we think the best way to make sure he wants to stay with us for as long as we can imagine is to give him a fast car, a combination of a fast chassis and a fast PU.

“As we say, we may not get that at the right level for race one, but because he understands so well motorsports, he will see the trajectories, and hopefully we can show him a strong enough trajectory that he feels that that group of people is going to produce the fastest car possible.

“And here is one of the things that will be great for people watching this season, is the amount of in-season development you are going to see. Both the chassis side and the power unit side is going to be three, four, five times more than what we have seen in the last few seasons, and so hopefully the pecking order is evolving through that.”

The actress was nominated for her role in 'If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.'

	If you watched the Golden Globes and were curious if Rose Byrne and her partner Bobby Cannavale ended up finding a bearded dragon, we have an update for you.


	“He's doing well!” Byrne told The Hollywood Reporter following her Oscar nomination for her performance in A24's If I Had Legs I'd Kick You. “It's for the kids. The kids arevery happy.” 




	During Byrne's acceptance speech at the Globes, she said Cannavale was not at the ceremony with her because he was in the process of finding a new, cold-blooded member of the family. “We're getting a bearded dragon, and he went to a reptile expo in New Jersey,” she said to laughter from crowd. (Byrne referred to Cannavale as “my husband” but has noted in previous interviews that the pair, who have been together for over a decade, are not legally married.)

	Will Cannavale join her at the Oscars ceremony in March? “Absolutely! It's the middle of the night in Australia, and he called me. So cute.”

	Byrne was nominated in the best lead actress category alongside Kate Hudson (Song Song Blue), Emma Stone (Bugonia), Jessie Buckley (Hamnet) and Renate Reinsve (Sentimental Value). “I can't believe it. I feel like I've snuck into the back of the bus. I can't believe we got in this extraordinary group of women,” she says. “And, you know, this movie's so small, it's so surreal, and means so much. This movie's so incredible and special and a true artistic expression, it's just wild.”

	











	Apart from the Globes win earlier this month, Byrne has been sweeping the awards circuit for her performance. She was nominated at the Critics Choice Awards, Independent Spirit and the Gotham Awards, for example, but won the National Board of Review Award for best actress, among others. She is also currently nominated for an Actor Award (formerly SAG Awards).


	With all of her accolades thus far, the Oscar nomination carries a unique weight.


	“The thought of the legacy and the pageantry and the scale of it, it's impossible to not have that value,” she says. “All of these sort of experiences we've had, and acknowledgements and recognition that we've had, it definitely feels like a monumental moment to have this acknowledgement. Of course, that huge kind of legacy and tradition of this ceremony is just undeniable, so to be a small part of that is unbelievable. I love the Oscars. [When I was a] little girl from Sydney, Australia, I used to watch [the show]. The pageantry of it is so fun and theatrical.”

Too bad that the retired couple's fridge breaks down, turning their apartment into a stage on which the tragicomedies of love, loss, ageing and Al Qahr (more on that below) play out against the background of farcical bureaucracy and crumbling attitudes and value systems. A corrupt maintenance company is also a key player in this Kafka-esque set-up for Complaint No. 713317, the debut feature film from writer-director Yasser Shafiey (short films The Dream of a Scene, Intense Practice to Improve Performance, The Man Who Swallowed the Radio), who started his career as a jewellery designer.

	The movie, starring well-known Egyptian acting icons Mahmoud Hemida and Sherine, as well as Hana Shiha, and Mohamed Radwan, will world premiere in the Bright Future program of the 55th edition of the International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR) on Feb. 1.

	As you can maybe already tell, the story of Complaint No. 713317 is about way more than a fridge. “What starts as a simple fridge repair drags a retired couple into an absurd battle, unravelling everything else that's quietly broken beneath the surface,” explains a synopsis for the film. “Caught in the grip of economic duress, the couple embody an eroding Egyptian middle class struggling to make ends meet,” highlights a preview for Complaint No. 713317 on the festival website. 


	Orient Films is handling sales on the film from production companies Red Star Films and Misr International Films.

	











Complaint No. 713317 is about “what we've learned to live with – or without,” Shafiey shares in a director's statement. “Phone calls, delays, empty promises, silence. What we think is a journey to repair an appliance becomes something far more painful – a fight to hold on to their dignity in a system that keeps stripping it away.” 


	At its core, he says Complaint No. 713317 is about “Al Qahr,” a word with no real translation in English, “or any other language,” he notes. “Not quite injustice. Not just oppression. It's something deeper and heavier, something we know intimately in this part of the world. Al Qahr is the emotional, psychological, and social weight of being denied your most basic rights – quietly, daily, endlessly – until it becomes a way of life. It is when nothing works, and no one listens, and you are left to face it all alone.” 


	Concludes the filmmaker: “This film is quiet. But so is Al Qahr. It doesn't always explode. It sits in the silence, the delays, the indifference. It's in the resignation on people's faces. In how they stop expecting anything better.”


THR can now exclusively reveal three clips from Complaint No. 713317. 


	The first teaser proves that more people don't always make a difference when it comes to problems with household devices, even if one of them is an engineer. Oh yeah, take a breath, too, and get ready to hold the line…


	The second Complaint No. 713317 clip features haggling for money, such phrases as “we are honest people,” the mention of German materials, and the realization that talking to customer service reps in person doesn't always solve your problem. Check it out here:

	











	Are you still holding the line? The final scene from Complaint No. 713317 offers up cups of tea, questions of conscience, and – yes, you guessed it! – more delays. The fridge may not be working, but the atmosphere is frigid. Watch the final clip from Complaint No. 713317 below.

Writers, actors and other musicians have come out in support of the Human Artistry Campaign's “Stealing Isn't Innovation” push for licensing and opt-out mechanisms for human-created works.


							By

Labor & Media Reporter


	Celebrities including Scarlett Johansson, Cate Blanchett and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are backing a campaign blasting tech companies for training generative AI tools on copyrighted works without express permission.


	The “Stealing Isn't Innovation” campaign from the Human Artistry Campaign, which launches Thursday, protests tech companies' alleged mass theft of human-created works in order to produce tools that could theoretically compete with real creatives. 




	On Thursday, the Human Artistry Campaign debuted the awareness campaign and revealed more than 700 supporters behind it, while The New York Times ran an ad for the push.

	“Big Tech is trying to change the law so they can keep stealing American artistry to build their AI businesses – without authorization and without paying the people who did the work. That is wrong; it's un-American, and it's theft on a grand scale,” one of the campaign's message proclaims. “The following creators all agree. Do you? If so, come join us.”

	In addition to Johansson, Blanchett and Gordon-Levitt, industry figures David Lowery, Fran Drescher, Jennifer Hudson, Kristen Bell, Michele Mulroney, Olivia Munn, Sean Astin and Vince Gilligan all signed their names as backing the campaign. Musicians such as Cyndi Lauper, LeAnn Rimes, Martina McBride and Questlove and the groups MGMT, One Republic, R.E.M. and OK Go have also given their support, as did the authors George Saunders, Jodi Picoult, Roxane Gay and Jonathan Franzen.

	











	The Human Artistry Campaign is composed of a mix of unions representing creators, artists' rights groups and trade associations like the Writers Guild of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, The NewsGuild, the NFL Players Association and SAG-AFTRA.


	The organization encourages tech companies to license works and also to allow creators to opt out of their projects being subject to generative AI training.


	“Real innovation comes from the human motivation to change our lives. It moves opportunity forward while driving economic growth and creating jobs,” Human Artistry Campaign senior advisor Dr. Moiya McTier said in a statement. “But AI companies are endangering artists' careers while exploiting their practiced craft, using human art and other creative works without authorization to amass billions in corporate earnings.”


	McTier added, “America wins when technology companies and creators collaborate to make the highest quality consumer and enterprise digital products and tools. Solutions like licensing offer a path to a mutually beneficial outcome for all.” 


	So far, only a couple Hollywood companies have dipped their toes into sanctioned licensing for generative AI tools. The biggest to date was Disney, which in December inked a three-year deal with OpenAI to bring some of its iconic characters to the video-generation tool Sora.


	But the AI company raised eyebrows in Hollywood just a few months earlier, when upon release Sora 2.0 produced characters from titles including Bob's Burgers, Pokémon, Grand Theft Auto and SpongeBob Squarepants in its outputs. At the time, the company's position was that rights holders could contact the firm to opt out and have their works excluded from the video generator. A few days later, the company walked back that position.

The gravelly-voiced singer tells Billboard that the show may have convinced him to get back in the studio for the first time in three decades.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



SPOILER ALERT: The following story contains details about the singer eliminated on Wednesday night's (Jan. 21) episode of The Masked Singer.


	There are typically two kinds of celebrities who get revealed on The Masked Singer: ones who the judges and studio audience simply can't pinpoint because they've adjusted their vocals and mannerisms just enough to go incognito and ones with such an unmistakable, signature tone to their voice that it's pretty obvious from jump who they are.


	Wednesday night's (Jan. 21) boot-ee was one of the latter. If you're old enough to have shopped for CDs in the Bush 1.0/Clinton era, then you probably sussed out the identity of Handyman from the second he took the stage last week. While the artist was hidden in a bright yellow, Jack-of-all-trades outfit — complete with hard hat and prominent tool belt — when he got funky with Peaches & Herb's 1978 Billboard Hot 100 No. 5 disco classic “Shake Your Groove Thing,” a lightbulb likely popped up right away.

	











	And while he was hidden behind a metallic mask as he waved his wrench arms and sang into a screwdriver microphone, the low, throaty growl and laconic delivery was pretty much a dead giveaway. The first clue package was also kind of obvious, with a reference to his “wild guy face” and a crew of past big-screen co-stars including Robert DeNiro (Heat) and Courteney Cox (Ace Ventura: Pet Detective).


	Then, on Wednesday night's Clueless-themed episode, he joined the rest of the cast for a run through Kim Wilde's 1981 classic “Kids in America” alongside fellow season 14 contestants Pugcasso, Scarab and Snow Cone, with his voice again reading pretty obviously after he described the childhood accident that gave him his signature rasp. His vocals really popped during his run through A Tribe Called Quest's “Can I Kick It?,” which got both the crowd and the judges on their feet as he showed off his impressive rhyming skills, with the audience enthusiastically chanting “yes you can!”

	











	When it came time to guess, panelist Rita Ora went with Vanilla Ice — based on a clue featuring an ice sculpture of a microphone — though the more “gravelly” voice made her think Ice-T. Always wrong Ken Jeong was all the way off with his pick of A-Team legend Mr. T. He was, naturally, totally in the wrong ballpark, as the real man behind the mask was none other than “Funky Cold Medina” rapper and occasional actor (Poetic Justice, Posse) Tone Lōc. (Scarab was also unmasked on Wednesday night, revealed to be Oscar-nominated actress Taraji P. Henson.)


Billboard caught up with Lōc (born Anthony Terrell Smith), 59, before his elimination to find out why he didn't even try to disguise his instantly recognizable voice, who convinced him to appear on the show and why the show may have convinced him to get back in the studio for the first time in three decades.


You said your daughter dared you to do the show. What did she say?


	She grew up with me and she was like, “There's no way you would do something like that.” I had never seen it, but she had and now I see what she was talking about. [She said] “You would not put on a mask and costume and dance and sing.” Once I saw it, I said, “Yeah I'll do it.” Most people who called after the first day [I was on the show] saw me on there and had no idea I was doing it. 


What did they say?












	First they said, “‘Shake Your Groove Thing?' Huh?”


Were they able to figure out it was you right away?


	Oh, immediately. “Oh, dude, first voice we heard, we knew.” I didn't realize [my voice] was that noticeable. It is kind of, a little bit, I think.


C'mon! You have such a distinctive voice, one of the most distinctive in rap, really. Did you even try to switch it up to fool people?


	I mean, I think I did try, but I couldn't change it. It's basically is what it is. When I try to change it even slightly, it doesn't matter. It is what it is, it's who I am.


Sometimes singers will purposely pick a song out of their genre, like you were saying with Peaches & Herb, but then tonight you went with a Tribe song, which kind of made it more obvious who was under the hard hat. Did you do that on purpose?


	I didn't really know. I couldn't hear it [in the costume] but it was kind of cool. I don't know how it came out sounding, but I liked it. I didn't pick Peaches to throw anyone off… they had some songs they wanted me to sing that wouldn't have worked out well. I think my agent decided, “Let's try Peaches & Herb.” I don't know what was on his mind. Tribe was cool, though. 


You've been doing the I Love the 90s tour for a couple years, but haven't really been on the music scene that much. Why this show to come back to singing on a big platform?


	I've been doing that tour for like six years and I did this, like I said, because of the dare. I'm still doing shows; I have never stopped doing shows. I've always tried to keep it pushing, maintain the people who like Tone Lōc, stay in my lane.


The Handyman was a bonkers costume. Why did you pick that one?












	They handed it to me. It's a big costume with a big helmet and head. You have to be committed, because that's a serious costume. You have to make sure you have everything tight. I like Handyman, that was the most masculine one I've seen, that worked out quite well. 


It's been 35 years since your last album, 1991's Cool Hand Lōc. Any chance you're working on a new album now?


	Oh man, that long? Man. I wasn't working on a new album, but I think I will now because of the big song I do have now that is bigger than [my other hits]. It's called “Hey, What's Up?” and I haven't recorded it yet. I do it live on tour and the audience response to that is way higher than “Funky Cold Medina” or “Wild Thing.”


The judges' guesses were hilarious: Vanilla Ice, Ice-T Mr. T…


	The ones who don't know, who have no idea who Tone Lōc is. Then you have people who know exactly who that is from the first word or two out of that graggily-ass voice. Now I see how my voice sounds to people, I had no idea.

Men at Work's “Down Under” is Australia's unofficial anthem, a classic tune played at sporting events, pubs, and celebrations around the world whenever Aussies gather. It's not, however, a siren's call for the far right.

	That's the word according to Colin Hay, the Scotland-born frontman and songwriter with Men at Work, which had a global hit with “Down Under” in the early ‘80s.

	Hay has drawn a virtual line in the sand, telling “March For Australia” organizers to find another song to play at their rallies.


	“Let me say that I most strenuously disapprove of any unauthorized, unlicensed use of Down Under, for any ‘March For Australia' events,” he writes. “'Down Under,' a song I co-wrote, does not belong to those who attempt to sow xenophobia within the fabric of our great land, our great people,” he continues.


	“'Down Under' is ultimately a song of celebration. It's for pluralism and inclusion; unity, not division. Go write your own song, leave mine alone.”


	He signs off his message, “Colin Hay (immigrant).”


	Men at Work enjoyed a dream breakthrough with their debut album Business As Usual, and its standout single “Down Under,” which reigned for four weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, and has sold more than two million copies in the United States.

	











	With Business As Usual and “Down Under,” the band had the unusual distinction of simultaneously topping the singles and albums charts in the United States and the United Kingdom.


	It's not the first time Hay has had to fight for his signature song. Hay and his Men at Work co-songwriter Ron Strykert were involved in a bruising court battle, which began in 2009 and centered on the flute riff and whether it was lifted from the children's campfire song “Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree.” To settle the case, a court ordered Men at Work to pay just 5% of royalties in the song.


	Hay told Billboard in 2023 that “Down Under” is “very dear to me. When I wrote the song, I had a lot of fear and trepidation about Australia becoming overdeveloped, like you know, Florida or something, and on the other side of the coin, there was this beautiful uniqueness and incredible — a kind of awesomeness — of the country which I thought, ‘we don't want to lose that'. We have to nurture, it's a precious thing we have.”


	“Down Under” has passed more than one billion streams across all platforms, and enjoyed a second life when it was reworked as a drum ‘n' bass cut by Australian producer Luude, over Hay's vocals. The new version crashed the top 10 on the Official U.K. Singles Chart, peaking at No. 5 in 2021.


	Men at Work was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1994, and Hay received the Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music at the 2023 APRA Music Awards.

The shows will kick off in Amsterdam in May.

	Thomas Smith



	Dig out the feather boas and plan your sparkliest getup: Harry Styles is heading out on a global world tour in 2026.


	The newly announced run of 50 dates in seven cities — called Together, Together — will take Styles to Europe, North America, Latin America and Australia. The first show kicks off in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on May 16, and the trek is currently slated to conclude in Sydney, Australia, on Dec. 13.


	The Together, Together residencies come in support of upcoming fourth solo LP, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, due for release on March. 6 via Columbia. The album's lead track, “Aperture,” is set for release Thursday evening (Jan. 22) at 7 p.m ET; a number of in-person listening parties were held in cities across the world on Wednesday in anticipation of the track.


	Styles first began teasing his return to the stage in late 2025 by sharing a video from his most recent concert in Bologna, Italy. The date was the final stop on his two-year Love On Tour run, which grossed $617 million across 169 shows and, at the time of its conclusion, was the fifth-highest grossing tour of all time, according to Billboard Boxscore.

	











	Last Thursday, Styles announced the title and release date of his forthcoming album, his first since 2022's Grammy-winning Harry's House.




	The tour will kick off with six nights at Amsterdam's Johann Cruijff Arena before heading to London's Wembley Stadium for a further six shows. In July, he hits São Paulo, Brazil then Mexico City, and the following month, he begins a 30-night residency at New York City's Madison Square Garden. In November, the tour begins its final stretch in Melbourne, Australia, and concludes in Sydney's Accor Stadium.


	A number of huge names will join him on tour at each stop with Robyn, Shania Twain, Fcukers, Jamie xx, Jorja Smith, Fousheé, Skye Newman and Baby J set to support.


	Tickets for the tour will go on general sale on Jan. 30 from Harry Styles' website.


	An artist presale will commence on Jan. 28 via AMEX with full details and times for each date available at Styles' site. To participate in the artist presale for New York, fans must sign up at Ticketmaster before Jan. 25 11:59 p.m. ET. For dates in Europe and Australia, hopefuls must pre-order the new album from Styles' U.K., E.U. or AU stores before Saturday, Jan. 24, at 11:59 p.m. local time to access. 


	The Together, Together run features a number of charitable partners. Humanitarian charity Choose Love is partnered on all dates, with HeadCount also partnering with Styles at his New York shows. In the U.K., £1 from every ticket will be donated to the LIVE Trust to support grassroots music venues.

					By Antonia Blyth 

Executive Editor, Awardsline


	In California early Thursday morning, Ryan Coogler said he and the Sinners team — his partner in production and in life, Zinzi Coogler, and their longtime co-producer Sev Ohanian — were still taking in the reality of a “pretty crazy” 16 Oscar nominations.


Sinners has broken all previous records with its nominations sweep, beating out historical big Oscar dominators like All About Eve, La La Land and Titanic.

 I did not have any expectations when it came to the recognition of what they [the team] did. For me, people just showing up to the movies and having a good time, that would've been enough. That is worth all the effort.


	Typically horror does not get widely recognized by the Academy. When asked by Deadline what it meant to have his film with some horror elements break that mold, the director said, “I haven't had a chance to think about it on the genre thought, but as far as pride in what we made and how we made it, I was so thankful that everybody said yes to this movie. My partners included, because I knew that the movie on the surface could be read as very strange. And I say that in the best of ways, because I also really love strange movies. Those are the movies that I always admired. And I always admired the bravery of artists that were able to make movies that were kind of undefinable when it came to genre, and scary movies and movies that went there in any particular way.”

	











	He also acknowledged that, with his filmmaking history including Fruitvale Station, Creed and Black Panther, he “was not known for making movies with horror elements. So I knew that it would also be maybe some sticker shock that it was coming from me, but to see how my partners wrapped their arms around it and everybody came down to New Orleans and put their lives on hold for a few months to make this thing and gave it their all, that filled me with just an incredible sense of gratitude. And seeing everybody's contributions up close, I knew the quality of what people were doing.”

	Given the Oscar nominations sweep for Sinners, Coogler added, “I did not have any expectations when it came to the recognition of what they [the team] did. For me, people just showing up to the movies and having a good time, that would've been enough. That is worth all the effort. But that people would consider the craft and the achievements that went into it individually. It's so rewarding.”

To see [Michael B. Jordan] achieve this recognition by his peers, it's just the best feeling to have.


	Speaking alongside the Cooglers, Ohanian said that Sinners' record number of nominations had not been his only delightful surprise this morning. Ahead of the 5.30AM announcement he received some unexpected visitors at his house. “My doorbell rang at 5:15, ding dong! And it was my mom and my dad and my sister who live nearby. They showed up with a bunch of food and they're like, ‘Let's just put the TV on, let's do this.' So my wife and I had a chance to see it next to them. It was really lovely.”

	











	But of course there was also time for a little dad joke in there too. “My dad was keeping count next to me. And when he said that, I was like, ‘Dad, you got it wrong. There's no way it's that many.' And he's been gleefully pointing out how right he was once the articles came out: ‘So you trust the articles, you don't trust my counting?'”


	Another great surprise was Delroy Lindo being recognized in Supporting Actor and Wunmi Mosaku in Supporting Actress. 


	The Cooglers actually live just down the street from Lindo. “Delroy lives in Oakland,” Ryan Coogler said. “He lives a few minutes away from me and Zinzi, so we got to know him before working with him and we'll see him around at the post office and stuff. And we've obviously become incredibly close with Wunmi. We got really close with her and her family. Our children will play together and we got to know her husband.”


	With Michael B. Jordan nominated in best Actor, Coogler also looked back on their longtime collaboration that began ahead of 2013's Fruitvale Station. “Obviously the three of us have been working with Michael since 2012. So that's a 14-year relationship. We produced his first directorial debut [Creed III] some years back and have been working with him in every capacity, in every way in between. And he's been in the business for a couple decades. So to see him achieve this recognition by his peers, it's just the best feeling to have. We just feel really, really, really happy that they said yes to the project, first of all, and happy for them.”

So happy for them and the team of OBAA too. This film is the first one where it completely shifted from really good to great within the ending, through these post credit scenes. Im sure quite a few people missed it. The impact is astonishing.

	Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another followed with 13 nominations, marking a stellar one-two punch for Warner Bros. The studio scored 30 nominations in total, tying its record number of nominations set in 2005. Indie distributor Neon and streamer Netflix had 18 noms each, while Focus Features had 13 and A24 had 11.


	Netflix's Frankenstein, A24's Marty Supreme and Neon's Sentimental Value all garnered nine nominations, while Focus' Hamnet had eight. All are in the marquee Best Picture race joining Sinners, One Battle, Focus' Bugonia, Apple's F1, Neon's The Secret Agent and Netflix's Train Dreams. See all of the Best Picture winners through the years here.

	The biggest surprise of the morning was without question the entire shutout pitched by Wicked: For Good, just one year after the first film in the franchise scored 10 nominations, converting in two categories.


	Among other surprises were the omissions of Guillermo del Toro for Best Directing and the omissions of two widely tipped actors: Paul Mescal (Hamnet) for Best Supporting Actor and Chase Infiniti (One Battle After Another) in the Best Actress category.


	A number of records and milestones were achieved this morning. At 30, Marty Supreme star Timothée Chalamet has become the youngest male actor to earn three acting nominations. 


	Steven Spielberg (Hamnet) received his 14th nomination for Best Picture, a record for an individual producer (since 1951, when producers were first named as nominees).


RELATED: Neon Dominates International Feature Film Oscar Category With Four Nominations


International films scored well again. A record four non-English language performances are nominated this year (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, Wagner Moura, Renate Reinsve and Stellan Skarsgård). The previous record of three was set in 1976 (Marie-Christine Barrault, Giancarlo Giannini and Liv Ullmann). This comes after international actors were shut out in SAG-AFTRA's Actor Awards nominations.


The Secret Agent and Sentimental Value are the 12th and 13th non-English-language films to be nominated for both International Feature Film and Best Picture in the same year. Parasite in 2020, also from Neon, is the only film to win both International Feature Film and Best Picture. For the eighth year in a row, at least one non-English-language film has been nominated in the Best Picture category. Click through a photo gallery of the winners in the category here. 


	The Animated Feature race features the highest-grossing Hollywood toon of all time (Walt Disney Studios' Zootopia 2) and Netflix's most popular film ever (KPop Demon Hunters), along with Neon's Arco, Disney/Pixar's Elio and Gkids' Little Amélie or the Character of Rain.


	The 98th Oscars will be held on Sunday, March 15, at the Dolby Theater at Ovation Hollywood and will air live on ABC and streaming on Hulu. Conan O'Brien returns as host.

No Paul mescal? :(

Happy for Sinners!!!!  Surprised and happy F1 got a best picture nomination.  That was my favorite movie last year.

It boggles the mind that Sinners got so many nominations. It is a pretty average movie and all the other nominees literally blow it out of the water. I imagine some really great films are going to get robbed by this movie.

Can't really argue with the list. A good spectrum of recognition for the most part. Soooo glad Amy Madigan was nominated for Weapons. Her Gladys was one of the standouts of the year and unlike anything else out there. Also kudos to Kate Hudson. She was terrific in Song Sung Blue. Also, Wunmi Mosaku in Sinners. 

Very happy for Sinners, which along with Weapons were two of the most original, best directed films of the year and completely irrelevant that they were both horror flicks. 

A bit sad that Russell Crowe didn't get nominated for Nuremberg. I get that his character is a tough one to recognize a performance for, but if you haven't seen that movie, Crowe delivers one of the best performances of the year and easily in the top 3 of his career. A very nuanced and multi-layered performance, playing a monster of a person who may or may not be a real human underneath or just faking it. Worth a watch. Also a good flick.

Honorable mention: After the Hunt. A film that fell under the radar but tackled some very challenging issues, and if you see this film with someone, it will definitely start conversations. 

Hamnet was marvelous as was One Battle After Another. Hard to pick, between the two, so I would go with Sinners. It was a great film, a nail-biter, a gothic horror, a gorgeous period journey through music and injustice, and a triumph for Ryan Coogler for how to produce a studio film in the modern era.

So pleased that Sentimental Value is being recognised. Superlative performances across the board.

					By Dade Hayes 

Business Editor


Paramount has extended the deadline for Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders to throw their support behind the company's hostile takeover bid.


	The initial deadline of Wednesday has now been pushed to February 20, the company said in an SEC filing. Paramount CEO David Ellison, along with his senior exec team and financial backers, have been meeting with WBD investors in recent weeks in order to persuade them to tender their shares in favor of Paramount's offer.


	Paramount has vowed to wage a proxy fight and launch an effort to elect a set of board members who will push its offer over Netflix‘s proposal, which was accepted by WBD last December. Thursday morning's filing is the first step in that anticipated fight.

	In a statement after the Paramount filing, WBD noted a disclosure in it that 168.7 million shares had been tendered over the past six weeks, a small fraction of the total number of outstanding WBD shares. “Paramount continues to make the same offer our board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,” the statement said. “It's also clear our shareholders agree, with more than 93% also rejecting Paramount's inferior scheme.” The statement went on to express confidence in the Netflix deal gaining regulatory approval.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Days after Netflix and WBD announced their $82.7 billion deal last December for the streaming giant to acquire the studios-and-streaming division of Warner, Paramount went hostile. It went directly to WBD shareholders to ask them to consider its bod, which has an enterprise value of $108.4 billion, calling it superior to Netflix's in many respects. Paramount and its allies continue to believe that their $30-a-share proposal has a better chance to get approved by regulators and that it offers more to shareholders given it is a takeover of the entire company.


	Netflix's deal, by comparison, would leave shareholders with a “stub” in the form of Discovery Global, the division of WBD that controls a fading portfolio of linear TV networks. Paramount has assigned minimal value to the stub, but Netflix and the WBD board have said the components of Discovery Global, including CNN, have value in the open market. WBD is planning to proceed with a split of the company this spring. 

	











	A key question now is whether Paramount will raise its offer, and how Netflix would then respond. Netflix stock has sunk about 30% since the news of the deal emerged last fall, with many analysts worrying that the transaction is a defensive move and points toward a year or two of massive distractions for the dominant streamer. 


	As it continues the main chess game, Paramount has also sued WBD in Delaware Chancery Court, looking to compel it to release more information it says shareholders deserve to see. In a recent SEC filing, Paramount noted Thursday, WBD “revealed for the first time some of the critical information that had been withheld from its shareholders, but it still has omitted highly material information its shareholders need about Discovery Global.”


	Hollywood has been on tenterhooks as the storied Warner assets, chief among them the film and TV studio and HBO, prepare to have their fourth new owner in a decade. The ultimate result of the takeover battle – whose plot has been additionally thickened by the comments and ties to the stakeholders of President Trump – will reshape the business forever and could cast a shadow over a major studio just a handful of years after Fox was swallowed up by Disney. 


	While the valuation of the rival Warner offers has not changed, the financial terms have been tweaked, with both now in all-cash. In response to the WBD board's reservations, billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison also agreed to personally guarantee a large chunk of the Paramount offer.

She's obviously just not into you…

No mean no… Stalker… 😅

I guess shareholders aren't receptive to Ellison.  Good.  Ellison already made a mess of Paramount/CBS.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	Warner Bros made the Oscar history books with the just-revealed nominations for the 98th Academy Awards.


Sinners with a whopping 16 just set the all-time record for nominations. It is up for Picture, Actor Michael B. Jordan, Supporting Actress Wunmi Mosaku, Supporting Actor Delroy Lindo, Director and Original Screenplay for Ryan Coogler, Music Score, Song “I Lied To You”, Cinematography, Production Design, Costume Design, Sound , Editing, Makeup & Hair, Casting, and Visual Effects.


	The previous record of 14 nominations was shared by three films, the first to do it was 1950's All About Eve , a record it held at the Academy for 47 years until 1997's Titanic tied it with 14 as well (it missed for screenplay or it would have broken the record). It took another 19 years until 2016 when La La Land joined the pair also with 14 nominations. Both All About Eve with 6 wins and Titanic with 11 went on to win Best Picture. Famously so did La La Land  —for about a minute and 45 seconds – until the correct envelope was awkwardly revealed on stage and Moonlight, not La La Land was announced as the winner. La La Land did take 6 Oscars, but still stands in the record books as the most nominated movie not to win Best Picture.

Smoke deserved the nomination but Stack phoned it in.

The First film I wanted to see multiple times in a LONG TIME.  Well deserved.  Congrats to the entire production.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Who is NYC nightclub giant Richie Akiva? Meet the mogul accused of beating ex-pal with metal pipe in bed","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/21/celebrity-news/who-is-nightclub-founder-richie-akiva-meet-leonardo-dicaprios-pal-who-was-arrested/","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 02:52:00 GMT","

Richie Akiva is one wild boy. 

The former nightclub founder, who was arrested on Wednesday, has a long history of wild parties, star-studded adventures and serious business deals. He also happens to be a good friend of Leonardo DiCaprio.

Read along to learn more about the “Titanic” star's close pal.

The Wednesday arrest isn't the night club entrepreneur's first run-in with police. Akiva was arrested in March 2025 after it was discovered that he was driving with a suspended license.

He was taken to New York's 9th precinct, where he was charged with misdemeanors. A source previously told Page Six he was hit with one count of aggravated unlicensed operation in the second degree, and one count of an equipment violation.

It was reported that his license was suspended because of an old unpaid parking ticket. 

Akiva earned his claim to fame as the founder of iconic NYC hotspots 1Oak and Up & Down.

He was also part of Butter Group — which included an array of restaurants and popular nightclubs — with former business partner Scott Sartiano.

In 2017, it was reported that the mogul had plans to open a rock ‘n' roll bar titled E. Vil (pronounced “evil”), which stands for East Village.

In June 2022, he launched the exclusive members-only club The Ned alongside Ron Burkle and Soho House founder Nick Jones.

Akiva was attached to the business venture as its “brand and creative director,” bringing in celebs like DiCaprio, Rihanna, Emily Ratajkowski, G-Eazy and “SNL” comic Leslie Jones.

It was reported in 2023 that he had a falling out with his former Butter Group business partner, Darren Dzienciol. They now hold rival bashes during May's Cannes Film Festival.

He was also pushed out of his business arrangement at The Ned by February 2024, allegedly due to some behind-the-scenes money haggling, a source previously told Page Six.

Akiva first hit the Hollywood scene as a core member of DiCaprio's entourage since they were known as the “P–sy Posse” on the '90s nightlife scene. The entrepreneur eventually became known for his wide network of celebrity pals and wild parties.

In 2013, Akiva made headlines after he hosted a multi-city birthday bash featuring stars Steve Wynn, Diddy, Chris Brown and Miguel, whom he met up with at his 1OAK in Las Vegas where Robin Thicke performed “Blurred Lines.” 

He followed it up the following day with a private dinner at the Peninsula Rooftop in New York City hosted by Naomi Campbell. They were allegedly joined by guests Jay Z, Timbaland, Anne V and her beau Matt Harvey.

Thicke later appeared at Akiva's Paris birthday party in 2017. Additional guests included Lenny Kravitz, Kourtney Kardashian and her then-boyfriend Younes Bendjima, supermodels Jourdan Dunn, Taylor Hill, Joan Smalls and Doutzen Kroes.

In more recent years, Akiva has begun hosting his signature shindigs in St. Barts. In 2021, he hosted a New Year's Eve party on the popular celebrity hotspot island which, a source told us, was jumping with hundreds of people until the wee hours of the morning.

In 2022, he celebrated the launch of his private social club, Societe, with a star-studded event featuring appearances from Busta Rhymes; Ne-Yo and Gunna Alex Rodriguez; Giancarlo Stanton; NBA players Joakim Noah, Myles Turner, and Oshae Brissett; model Joan Smalls, and “Gossip Girl” cast members Thomas Doherty and Whitney Peak.

Over the years, DiCaprio and Akiva have remained as close as ever, with the actor making several appearances at the mogul's bashes. In 2024, the “Wolf of Wall Street” star was said to have helped out a drunk man at one of Akiva's epic parties in the Hamptons.

Nicola Peltz's ex's sister has entered the chat.

Anwar Hadid's sister Alana weighed in on the headline-making feud between the Beckham family and the “Lola” actress.

Commenting in an Instagram post about the drama, Alana claimed Peltz has wanted to be “famous” for years.

“Right and that girl doesn't want privacy she's been trying to be famous for a decade,” the model, 40, wrote.

Alana then took aim at Brooklyn's lengthy statement, in which he blasted his parents, David and Victoria Beckham, for trying to “ruin” his marriage to Peltz.

“Ending an eight paragraph rant about his family's dirty laundry with ‘all we want is privacy' is all I need to know,” Alana wrote.

Page Six has reached out to reps for Alana, Peltz and Brooklyn for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Peltz, 31, dated Anwar, 26, from 2016 to 2018. At the time they began dating, the “Bates Motel” alum was 22 and the model was 17.

Their romance reportedly ended due to strained family relations with Anwar and his mother, Yolanda Hadid. However, the specific reasons for the split were never made public.

Peltz is now involved in more family drama with her husband Brooklyn's estranged relatives.

On Monday, the aspiring chef, also 26, released a scathing statement against his parents, stating that he does not “want to reconcile” with them.

Brooklyn also claimed the Spice Girls singer, 51, and David, 50, push certain stories to the press about their eldest son and his wife.

The hot sauce brand owner alleged that Victoria tried to sabotage his April 2022 wedding day by cancelling “Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour” and hijacking the newlyweds' first dance.

Brooklyn said he and Peltz renewed their vows in August 2025 to “create new memories of our wedding day that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment.”

The nepo baby also denied claims that the “Transformers: Age of Extinction” star “controls” him, calling this notion “completely backward.”

The Beckhams have not directly addressed Brooklyn's claims; however, David made a cryptic comment about his children's “mistakes.”

Blake Lively's longtime fitness trainer recalled feeling “uncomfortable” during an interaction with Justin Baldoni.

Don Saladino recalled communicating with the “It Ends With Us” director “a handful of times” in February 2023, according to a court declaration obtained by Us Weekly Wednesday.

“He provided information on his nutrition and workout regimen. His existing workout program included regular back extensions,” Saladino said of Baldoni.

“I recommended Mr. Baldoni a workout program and provided information to him about my standard nutrition plan,” Saladino continued. “I also recommended a specific individual who lived near Mr. Baldoni at the time and who could act as his trainer.”

Advertisement

Saladino, who said he never met Baldoni in person, claimed the director called him on the phone during his training to ask a personal question about the “Gossip Girl” alum. 

“I recall that Mr. Baldoni asked me how much Ms. Lively would weigh by the start of filming,” Saladino claimed in the filing. “He said that he was asking about her weight in connection with a scripted lift scene, suggesting that he needed to know Ms. Lively's weight to determine whether he could perform the lift.”

Saladino said Baldoni's question made him “very uncomfortable.”

“I have never experienced someone reaching out to me about a client's weight,” Saladino claimed. “I felt that Mr. Baldoni's explanation for his question was dishonest, given that, based on my understanding of Mr. Baldoni's workout regimen, he would easily be able to perform a lift in a range that would include Ms. Lively.”

The gym coach claimed he did not share Lively's weight with Baldoni and immediately alerted the actress about the incident.

“Lively seemed embarrassed and hurt that Mr. Baldoni had asked about her weight without her permission,” Saladino recalled.

Page Six has reached out to Baldoni's rep for comment.

Saladino's statement confirmed reports in 2024 that Lively allegedly felt “fat-shamed” by Baldoni's inquiry into her weight.

At the time, sources claimed Baldoni asked a trainer about Lively's weight before shooting a scene where he had to lift her up.

The “Jane the Virgin” star, who reportedly has a history of back pain, wanted to make sure that he could lift her without injury. 

Lively felt “bothered” by his question about her weight — especially considering she gave birth to her fourth child just months before production for their movie began. 

The “A Simple Favor” star, 38, sued Baldoni, 41, for alleged sexual harassment on the set of their movie in December 2024. She also accused him of retaliation, breach of contract, infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and lost wages.

Baldoni denied the accusations and hit back with a $400 million countersuit accusing Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, of defamation. 

He also accused the New York Times — the first outlet to report on Lively's lawsuit — of libel.

Last June, a judge dismissed Baldoni's countersuit. 

Lively's lawsuit is still ongoing and trial is scheduled to begin on May 18.

We've said it before, and we'll say it again: Naming your TV show anything that will make for a punny headline when it nigh-inevitably gets canceled is just asking for trouble. Something Netflix and Kurt Sutter just got done proving all over again, as Variety reports that the former has just rendered the latter's historical Western series The Abandons, well… You know.

The news was one of two cancellations the streamer handed down today, having also placed up on the chopping block two-season comedy series The Vince Staples Show. That one's both a bummer, and a bit of a surprise, in so far as the show—originally created by the Summertime '06 rapper with Ian Edelman and Maurice Williams, and centered on a surreal version of Staples' life as an easily recognized celebrity—was both a critical hit and a genuinely funny, interesting slice of comedy TV. In The A.V. Club‘s review of the show's second season, Leila Latif wrote that, “In a landscape crowded with self-referential comedies, this one still feels singular, less a parody of Black excellence than a meditation on what it costs to live inside your own image,” praising Staples' chops as a comic actor, and ultimately calling the series “one of Netflix's brightest comedies.”

The Abandons, not so much. Even if you ignore the show's dismal critical reaction—our own D+ was par for the course, noting that not even TV stalwarts like Lena Headey and Gillian Anderson could find much to do with the series' stale take on 1850s frontier living—the show's incredibly troubled production probably had it doomed anyway. In what could be taken as a preemptive bout of title pun synergy, Sutter reportedly walked away from the series with an episode left to film after getting into arguments with the streamer, leaving the show's other producers to scramble to get something workable on the screen. That wouldn't have boded well even if the resulting series turned out to be a masterpiece; as is, it's one of the less surprising cancellations we've seen in a minute.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Patagonia tries to find politest way possible to sue drag queen/environmental activist Pattie Gonia","https://www.avclub.com/patagonia-sues-drag-queen-pattie-gonia","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:51:57 GMT","

In the course of our work here at The A.V. Club‘s Newswire desk, we tend to read more than our fair share of legal complaints centered on the entertainment industry—and filter through a lot of extremely vitriolic language in the process, because, boy howdy, do corporate lawyers like to throw around ten-dollar character denigrations when they're trying to set a litigious mood. (We still think sometimes about the Warner Bros. South Park lawsuit that had all-caps, bold letter chapter headings like THE ILLICIT CONSPIRACY EMERGES dotting its text.) So it was fairly eye-catching when we dug in today into a recent lawsuit filed by clothing brand Patagonia (via Reuters) against drag queen and environmental activist Pattie Gonia, only to find that it's just about the most sheepish such accusation of copyright infringement we've ever encountered.

The legal issues here seem fairly straightforward, at least to our not-an-actual-legal-expert eyes: The company claims it's had an understanding with Pattie Gonia (a.k.a. performer Wyn Wiley, who's been using the on-stage persona to promote environmental causes since 2018) that dates back to 2022, in which Patagonia promised to not make an issue of the name as long as she didn't sell anything with the “Pattie Gonia” moniker on it, or do promotion in a way that mimicked the company's distinctive logo. (Pattie Gonia and her team dispute that that was the arrived-at agreement in their own communications quoted in the suit; we'll get to those more in a second.) The lawsuit then follows those assertions with lots of images of both the Pattie Gonia merch store—launched in 2024, and in which she sells repurposed clothes stamped with Pattie Gonia branding in a non-Patagonia-looking font—and various promotional photos of Pattie Gonia sporting clothes and accessories featuring a logo that is clearly riffing on Patagonia's mountain range branding.

What's striking about the complaint (readable here), though, is how obviously the company knows that it's going to lose any kind of PR war that breaks out on the front of “large clothing company sues drag queen who spends her days promoting environmental causes.” It notes, frequently, that it respects and admires Pattie Gonia's work; asserts that it has to protect its trademark even from people it likes; includes fully 16 set-up paragraphs detailing its various charitable acts; and ends by noting that it's only asking for a nominal $1 in damages (alongside the request that California courts shut down Pattie Gonia's commercial use of the name.) Even so: Probably screwed, at least when it comes to the “Just be cool, okay?” test.

It's worth noting that, while Pattie Gonia/Wiley hasn't responded directly to the lawsuit yet, Patagonia's complaints do include emails from both her and her business manager, and they are both quite a bit meaner, and quite a bit funnier, than the company's own efforts. These include asserting that a) she's named after the South American region, and “It's wonderful that both Patagonia the brand and Pattie Gonia the drag queen are inspired by Patagonia's beauty,” b), that she was actually about to write them to distance herself from their brand, because of controversy over military contracts Patagonia has taken in the past to provide clothes for the U.S. military, and—most hilariously—c), a statement that, while all of the shirts sold in the Pattie Gonia store are taken from discarded clothes headed for the garbage heap, “per the brand Patagonia's consideration…we won't save any of the brand Patagonia's product we frequently find heading to landfills.” Which is about as literal a version of reading someone for filth as we've ever encountered.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Return To Silent Hill for the series' worst film adaptation yet","https://www.avclub.com/return-to-silent-hill-review","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 12:05:38 GMT","

Typically, reunion tours are reserved for beloved acts getting up in front of fans old and new in order to, hopefully, instill something aside from pure nostalgia into their playing of the hits. A bit of age-earned gravitas, or time-honed virtuosity, or at least some erosion of self-seriousness might add depth to the fan service. But that can sometimes be wishful thinking, and the trip down memory lane can be a sobering one—a depressingly staid and cynical attempt to recapture a fleeting magic, every failure to do so exposed by the glaring house lights and an extra-attentive audience. This is what befalls writer-director Christophe Gans, who shuffles his way back to the Silent Hill franchise two decades after first bringing the games to the big screen (the series' on-screen hopes later fully dashed by the messy production of its sequel, Revelation). Somewhere between a reboot and a remake, Return To Silent Hill is the worst film of the franchise so far, and a reminder that you can't go home again—even if your home is the haunted hamlet of Silent Hill.

While Return To Silent Hill takes most of its plot from Silent Hill 2—where James Sunderland (Jeremy Irvine) is summoned to the spooky town by his late love Mary (Hannah Emily Anderson)—it never strays far from the images of Gans' original adaptation. This is the film's biggest mistake: Somehow, 20 years of technological development and filmmaking experience has made every single facet of this film uglier and duller than 2006's Silent Hill, probably because this time around, Gans' team worked with a fraction of that movie's $50 million budget.

When drunken pseudo-punk painter James, looking a bit like if Tim Robbins was in Supernatural and hadn't slept for a month, stumbles back to the idyllic lakeside town where he first met Mary, he finds it a rotted, ash-covered, hyper-digital wasteland. But it doesn't feel abandoned, per se, just empty—like how so many green-screen-heavy films can't shake the sense that they were predominately shot inside a warehouse. Each frame is so sparsely filled and every shot is so wide that there's no creepiness or claustrophobia in its bare monotone; when James crashes over a trashcan, it's not a tension-breaking shock, but the obvious bumblings of a fool. This style evokes late-era Stranger Things, where each new shot is entirely disconnected from the preceding one, where an actor's only direction is to stand on a dot and trust that FX artists will salvage things in post. It is through this blurry and ugly blizzard of blue-gray mush that James trudges, driven only by his need to run through a list of recognizable touchstones—a staticky radio, for example—from the game.

Yet, Easter eggs only go so far when they're planted in what looks like a fan film, where Pyramid Head and Bubble Head Nurses at least only come off as cosplay and not, like the other monsters, completely unfinished. Where the towering, musclebound avatar of guilt and the contortionist healthcare providers are simply a little more cartoonish and a lot less scary than their previous on-screen iterations, other creatures are hilariously janky, like they needed another round of textures applied to their too-smooth placeholder models. Poor James often looks like he's being attacked by badly animated production logos.

But gamers have been forgiving bad graphics for as long as there have been graphics, as long as other qualities—mood, story, gameplay—coalesce into a compelling experience. In Return To Silent Hill, though, this slapdash aesthetic is representative of the whole. Co-written by Gans, his Beauty And The Beast collaborator Sandra Vo-Anh, and Will Schneider (of The Crow remake), the plot follows a similar tack as the visuals, one reminiscent of an old punchline: Terrible, and such large portions! Guided by Irvine's incessant voiceover, James' exploration of the town dips in and out of reality, a cascading series of dismissively handled fake-outs, hallucinations, and bad dreams, punctuated by appearances from supporting characters even more wooden than the leads—including Mary's bad-girl reflection, Maria (Anderson).

Those looking for a more straightforward interpretation of Silent Hill 2‘s narrative, driven by and residing inside a troubled mind, will chafe against the writing team's dalliances with ideas from other parts of the franchise. James does seem to be struggling with his mental health, these problems revolving around his relationship with Mary, but various flashbacks also add in material differences that seem far more important, not least of which is a cult plot taken from the other games. Maintaining fidelity with some but not all of the source material generates a storytelling friction that does a disservice to both the faithful and added elements, the incongruous approaches making for a more ridiculous film than either of its predecessors—the emotional fallout of James and Mary's relationship doesn't seem that important once we discover that she's long been the drug-addled idol of her late father's blood cult. These sprawling and confounding Silent Hill elements rob James and Mary's story of its relatively contained purgatorial power, all the way through its hedged mash-up of endings. 

Return To Silent Hill contains nothing as psychologically potent as Silent Hill 2 or as aesthetically enveloping as Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro's P.T.; it can't even seem to remember how to evoke the effectively shlocky imagery of Gans' first film. Goofy and low-rent, it's a dire look at what happens when you can't leave the past behind—whether you're a horror game character or a video game movie filmmaker.

Jardyn Walker, more commonly known as “Pee Wee,” was tragically shot to death in St. Louis, where his body was found in a Central West End alley on Wednesday, Jan. 21, TMZ reports. He was 23 years old.

Pee Wee competed on “Two Ways With Erica Mena,” where he vied for the chance to win Erica Mena's heart during season 1 in 2025. Although he didn't win the “Love & Hip Hop” star's affection, Mena shared an emotional tribute for him on her Instagram Story.

Along with several photos of the late reality TV star, Mena wrote, “I'm so sorry,” and that she was “crushed.”

TMZ reports that the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department responded to a call about gunfire on Tuesday, Jan, 20. They arrested suspect Jamaal Jones after seeing him flee the scene. Jones has since been charged by prosecutors with first-degree murder, armed criminal action and tampering with evidence in connection to Pee Wee's death.

In addition to his appearance on the Zeus Network dating show, Pee Wee was a rising rapper in St. Louis, where local fans respected his work. He also appeared on “Bad Boys: Houston” in 2023, when he auditioned to be part of a group who traveled across Texas for club appearances.

When he wasn't making music or starring in reality TV shows, Pee Wee worked as a delivery driver. He was supposed to meet his sister after making a delivery on the night he died, leading to an investigation.

Influencer Isiah Jaay honored Pee Wee in an Instagram video, saying, “I was really hoping this wasn't true because I just literally seen Pee Wee at the auditions. We hugged and everything, so this is really sad.”

“And if you really know know Pee Wee, you know bro was cool. He didn't really bother nobody like that. But if you really messed with him, he was on that every time,” he added.

Influencer Terrance Lee Johnson expressed his shock over Pee Wee's devastating death on Instagram. He wrote, “Jardyn, known as Pee Wee from ‘Two Ways with Erica Mena' on Zeus, has left us far too soon after a violent incident, but his memory will live on through his inspiring appearance at the Bad Boys auditions.”

Comments under a social media post also showed how missed Pee Wee will be by his fans. One fan wrote that the late rapper had a “good heart,” while others referred to him as “lovely” and expressed wanting to see him continue to succeed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Legendary Producer Of 'The Hangover' and 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' Passes Away","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/hollywood-producer-david-siegel-passes/","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 02:01:42 GMT","

David Siegel, a longtime producer who worked on iconic films such as “The Hangover” trilogy and “Crazy, Stupid, Love,” has passed away at the age of 70 years old. He died on Jan. 8 in Los Angeles, a representative for New Line told Deadline. 

The representative went on to describe Siegel as “the person you wanted at your side when a production developed complications.”

“Colleagues were said to have remarked on his uncanny ability to connect with crew — a respect earned through the way his career evolved in the industry. He also mentored countless individuals across production, giving opportunities to those who demonstrated hard work and curiosity and advocating for them quietly,” Deadline wrote.

Throughout his career that spanned four decades, Siegel worked on numerous projects with incredible filmmakers such as Kevin Costner, Todd Phillips, Rob Reiner, Penny Marshall, and David Lester. Along with that, his resume includes working on films such as “Dances with Wolves,” “Gravity,” “The Pursuit of Happyness,” “The LEGO Movie,” “War Dogs,” “Serenity,” “Holes,” “Air Force One,” “Bull Durham,” and many others. 

His last project was “Final Destination: Bloodlines,” in which Siegel was an executive producer. 

Some comments were left on social media, paying tribute to the producer. 

“Rest in peace, David Siegel. Thank you for all the films and memories — your impact on Hollywood will be remembered,” one fan wrote. 

“Rest in peace, David Siegel. Your work on The Hangover trilogy and Crazy, Stupid, Love brought so much laughter to the world,” another fan posted. 

Hollywood is also mourning the loss of director Bruce Bilson, who passed away at the age of 97 at his home in Los Angeles on Friday, January 16, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Bilson served as the assistant director for “The Andy Griffith Show,” as well as working on other iconic series such as “Gidget,” “Hogan's Heroes,” “Bewitched,” “Get Smart,” “Bonanza,” “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” “The Odd Couple,” “Green Acres,” and “The Brady Bunch.” He also won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. 

“When I was starting out, I thought my camera work was awful, and I tried to make it more interesting,” he said in his TV Academy interview (per the Hollywood Reporter). “As I got older and more experienced, I learned to tell the story with the actors first, cameras second.”

With filming underway in Asheville, North Carolina, for Hallmark Channel's second “A Biltmore Christmas” movie, local media members were invited to the Biltmore Estate on January 20, 2026, for a peek behind the scenes. 

Not only were previously announced stars Niall Matter and Holland Roden on hand for interviews, but so was another Hallmark fan favorite, Rachel Boston, who made a cameo in the first movie and confirmed she's now part of the second installment, too! And she's not the only star fans are buzzing about being part of the movie, which also has an official title: “A Grand Biltmore Christmas.”

In 2024's “A Biltmore Christmas,” a screenwriter named Lucy, played by Bethany Joy Lenz, is tasked with writing a remake of the 1947 Christmas classic “His Merry Wife,” filmed at the historic Biltmore Estate. While touring the massive home for inspiration, she magically travels back in time to the set of the first movie and falls for the 1940s film's leading man, played by Kristoffer Polaha. 

When Lucy returns to the present day, she's seen on the set of her movie remake as the last scene is filmed, with Boston and Wes Brown playing the movie's leads — a double cameo that thrilled Hallmark fans. “A Grand Biltmore Christmas” is also a time travel tale, but because Hallmark has said it's not a true sequel, it's not clear whether Boston will return as the same modern-day actress or play an entirely different role. 

During press interviews, she told local ABC affiliate WLOS that she loved “having these memories and being back with this fabulous cast for ‘A Grand Biltmore Christmas.'” She also called Asheville “such a great town” and said that in their downtime, the cast “really enjoyed exploring.” 

Meanwhile, Brown teased his own return by posting a photo in his Instagram Stories on January 19 of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which the Biltmore House overlooks, and writing, “Hello, North Carolina.” Although he wasn't part of the press interviews the following day, Hallmark's PR team confirmed January 21 that he, too, is returning for “A Grand Biltmore Christmas.” 

As previously announced, “Star Trek” royalty Jonathan Frakes will also return for the second movie as Winston, a Biltmore staff member who seemed somehow privvy to the magical time-traveling properties of the hourglass in the first movie. 

Finally, there's also been buzz that “The Way Home” star and former Asheville resident Andie MacDowell may be a surprise addition to the cast. Jason Sanford of The AsheVegas Hot Sheet reported that he's “confident that she is a cast member” after talking to multiple sources. 

According to Hallmark's synopsis, the new movie will take viewers back to 1895 — the year the Biltmore House was completed — when a visiting 13-year-old named Elizabeth connects with a fellow teen named Michael. The two don't see each other again until 20 years later, when they're adults (played by Roden and Matter), back at the Biltmore. The magical hourglass from the first movie is back, too, and transports the duo to the present day — which may be where Michael is from to begin with.  

“I'm coming from the modern era in this movie,” Matter told WLOS. “And my character, you get to see my character in two different eras. You also get to see Biltmore at two different eras — actually, three different eras.” 

“Our characters are acquaintances in the past,” he continued, looking at Roden. “But maybe they become more in the present.” 

Boston, who also starred in Hallmark's top Christmas movie of 2025 — “The More the Merrier,” told local CBS affiliate WSPA of the new Biltmore movie script, “Having read it, I will say, it is absolutely adorable and very, very, very sweet.” 

Roden chimed in, “Not only is it a really wonderful romance front and center, but there's a lot of comedy that's unexpected.” 

The new movie, produced by Synthetic Cinema, which also was behind the first Biltmore movie, will premiere as part of Hallmark's 2026 slate of original Christmas movies. 

Are the ORIGINAL CAST MEMBERS like Beth Joy Lynz going to be in this movie??? She made the movie and without her it will not be the same.

Oscar nominations morning was a good day for Warner Bros., which took home a total 30 nominations. Mighty Best Picture frontrunner “One Battle After Another” racked up 13 nominations, including Picture, Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, Supporting Actors Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro, Supporting Actress Teyana Taylor, and Paul Thomas Anderson for Director and Adapted Screenplay. (One significant miss: newcomer Chase Infiniti for Best Actress, a calculated risk designed to give Taylor a shot at winning Supporting Actress.)

But it was Ryan Coogler's audacious period horror musical “Sinners” that landed 16 nominations (breaking the Oscar record of 14 set by “Titanic,” “All About Eve,” and “La La Land”), including Picture, Actor Michael B. Jordan, Supporting Actor Delroy Lindo (who knocked out “Hamnet” star Paul Mescal), Supporting Actress Wunmi Mosaku, and Coogler for Directing and Original Screenplay. The two music categories and Casting helped to put it over the top.

The comeback narrative for Hollywood scion Kate Hudson (musical “Song Sung Blue”) was too strong for the Academy Actors Branch to deny. Focus Features also had a good day, with 13 nominations, including Chloé Zhao's Shakespeare family drama “Hamnet” (eight). The BAFTAs should prove a strong boost for the movie, which missed a Paul Mescal nod, but did score Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Casting, and Actress (frontrunner Jessie Buckley), but not Editing or Cinematography. And Yorgos Lanthimos' “Bugonia” landed four slots: Best Picture, Producer and Actress (Emma Stone), Original Score, and Adapted Screenplay nominations. At 37, Stone is the youngest woman to earn seven nominations. 

 










Five movies — the period pictures that landed the Actor Awards ensemble, DGA, and PGA nominations — dominated the field: “Sinners” (16), “One Battle After Another” (13), A24's “Marty Supreme” (nine), Netflix's “Frankenstein” (nine), and “Hamnet” (eight), along with Norway's Oscar entry “Sentimental Value” (nine). Besides being hugely entertaining, all delivered emotional stories and political subtext. And “Hamnet” and “Sentimental Value” dealt with fractured families and the healing power of art. But “One Battle After Another” has been on a winning streak that shows no signs of slowing.

Another genre film, “Weapons,” gave veteran Amy Madigan her second nomination after 40 years (“Twice in a Lifetime”). 

Next in the nominations derby was gorgeously wrought “Frankenstein,” with nine nominations, scoring Best Picture and Adapted Screenplay slots, plus Supporting Actor Jacob Elordi, but not Director for DGA nominee Guillermo del Toro. The elevated horror film will win big in the crafts. Netflix totaled 18 nominations, including two for Animated Feature and Song frontrunner “KPop Demon Hunters,” four for Best Picture and Adapted screenplay contender “Train Dreams,” one for documentary nominee “The Perfect Neighbor,” and two shorts (“All the Empty Rooms” and “The Singers”).

 










Picture, Director, Original Screenplay, and Editing nominee Josh Safdie challenged Sean Baker and Warren Beatty for the most nominations for one movie for “Marty Supreme” (A24), which landed nine nominations, including Picture nominee (also as a producer) and Best Actor frontrunner Timothée Chalamet, who played table tennis like a pro. SAG nominee Odessa A'zion did not make the cut.

The international vote (24 percent of Academy voters) spoke loud with a total 18 nominations for Neon, which released European Film Awards winner “Sentimental Value,” with nine nods: Picture, Actress Renate Reinsve, Supporting Actor Stellan Skarsgård, and Supporting Actresses Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, along with Director Joachim Trier, Best International Feature, and Original Screenplay for Trier and Eskil Vogt (they were previously nominated for “The Worst Person in the World”). Clearly, the Actors Branch supports this movie.

Neon continued celebrating with a Best Picture nomination for Brazilian Oscar entry “The Secret Agent,” which also landed in Best Casting, Actor (Cannes and Globes winner Wagner Moura), and International Feature; Iranian Jafar Panahi's “It Was Just an Accident” (France), which missed Best Picture and Director but nabbed Original Screenplay and International slots; and Oliver Laxe's “Sirāt” (Spain), which did not wind up in the Best Picture race, but placed in International and Best Sound. Neon filled four of the five International slots with its Cannes prize-winners. Park Chan-wook's stylish Venice contender “No Other Choice” did not make it. The fifth feature was emotional “The Voice of Hind Rajab” (Willa).

 










PGA nominee “F1” (Apple Original Films) grabbed the 10th Best Picture spot, voted in by the surviving steak eaters in the Academy. The movie landed three craft nominations: Editing, Sound, and VFX.

The signs were strong that two box-office hit sequels that did not surpass their prior iterations, “Wicked: For Good” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” would see diminishing returns this time around. “Wicked” wound up empty-handed; even Ariana Grande did not land a Supporting Actress berth. Auteur James Cameron had to settle for Costume Design, Sound, and VFX, which will win.

If you want some counter programming to the Oscar nominations, look no further than the campy, fun, live-action take on “Masters of the Universe,” the film based on Mattel‘s '80s toy brand and cartoon.

Travis Knight, known for Laika's stop-motion animated films and the “Transformers” spinoff “Bumblebee,” has taken on the Herculean task of imagining the He-Man character and his battle with Skeletor for the big screen. Amazon MGM Studios is releasing “Masters of the Universe” June 5, 2026 in theaters.

Nicholas Galitzine stars as He-Man, a boy from Eternia who is sent away to our world, where he's stuck unfulfilling his destiny in a boring desk job. It's only when he tracks down the legendary Sword of Power that Prince Adam returns to Eternia to save his home from the evil Skeletor, who is portrayed by an unrecognizable Jared Leto.

The film also stars Camila Mendes as Teela, Idris Elba as the Man-At-Arms, as well as Alison Brie, James Purefoy, Morena Baccarin, Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson, Charlotte Riley, and Kristen Wiig as the voice of “Roboto.”

 










Chris Butler wrote the screenplay for “Masters of the Universe” along with Aaron Nee and Adam Nee and Dave Callaham, from a story by Aaron and Adam Nee, Alex Litvak, and Michael Finch. The film was produced by Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal, Robbie Brenner, Steve Tisch, and DeVon Franklin, and executive produced by Ynon Kreiz, Bill Bannerman, and David Bloomfield.

This is only Mattel's second film after the massive success of “Barbie,” which grossed $1.44 billion in 2023 from Warner Bros., though it's the first of many that Mattel has in development based on its numerous toys and games, including a Magic 8 Ball film by M. Night Shyamalan, as well as projects based on American Girl dolls, “Barney,” Hot Wheels, Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots, Polly Pocket, “Thomas & Friends,” and more.

It's also one of Amazon MGM's big tentpoles of the year as it enters 2026 with a full slate of theatrical releases, including the upcoming “Mercy” and “Project Hail Mary,” to name just a few. 

Check out the trailer for “Masters of the Universe” above.

After a lengthy Phase 1 of Oscar season that included early award shows like the Gothams, Critics Choice Awards, and Golden Globes, along with endless speculation about what their results might mean, we now know who landed the coveted nominations.

It was a great morning for Warner Bros., with Ryan Coogler's “Sinners” landing a record 16 Oscar nominations, the most for any movie ever. Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another” was not far behind with 13 nominations of its own, with both films picking up nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Leading Actor, Best Original Score, and their respective screenplay category, along with numerous acting nods. Apple's “F1,” which was distributed theatrically by Warner Bros., also picked up a Best Picture nomination.

If it's Oscar nominations morning (it is!), it's time to dig into some of the history made ever so quickly with the announcement of this year's class of nominees. 

As had long been predicted, “Hamnet” filmmaker Chloé Zhao, who previously won Best Director for directing “Nomadland,” has now joined a very rarefied club: female directors with two Best Director nominations. Previously, only Jane Campion, who was nominated for “The Piano” and won for “The Power of the Dog,” held the title.

With her historic nomination, Zhao joins a wider pool of directors who have been nominated multiple times in the vaunted category, including names like William Wyler, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, David Lean, Frank Capra, and many more.

Zhao also picked up a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay (shared with author Maggie O'Farrell), where the pair were the only women recognized. (No women were nominated in Best Original Screenplay.) And while Zhao is not a producer on “Hamnet” (they are the ones who win Best Picture), with the film's nomination in the Oscars‘ starriest category, she is responsible for the only woman-directed picture in the 10-film race.

 










Elsewhere, only one film in the Best International Feature Film category was directed by a woman: “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” directed by Kaouther Ben Hania. There were some bright spots in other races, however.

In the Best Documentary Feature Film race, women-directed films actually held the majority, including “The Alabama Solution,” co-directed by Charlotte Kaufman; “Cutting Through Rocks,” co-directed by Sara Khaki; and “The Perfect Neighbor,” directed by Geeta Gandbhir. The same was true in Best Animated Feature Film, which also included three films directed or co-directed by women: smash hit “KPop Demon Hunters,” co-directed by Maggie Kang; “Elio,” co-directed by Madeline Sharafian and Domee Shi; and “Little Amélie or the Character of Rain,” co-directed by Mailys Vallade.

Nominations voting for this year's Oscars ended on January 16. Final voting will take place from February 26 through March 5. And finally, the 98th Oscars telecast will air live on ABC on Sunday, March 15. Emmy-winning late-night host Conan O'Brien will return to host this year's ceremony.

Streaming service Sundance Now is one of AMC Networks‘ “targeted” streamers, a collection that also includes AMC+, horror-centric Shudder, and ALLBLK for African American audiences. Yet even though the streamer shares the name of the Sundance Film Festival and Institute, the content on Sundance Now has largely been for scripted series, highlighting shows like “Close to Me,” “Motherland,” and “This Close.”

On Thursday, January 22, however — the same day the Sundance Film Festival kicks off for the final time in Park City — AMC Networks is rebranding Sundance Now to be the definitive streaming destination for indie film… just like the festival Sundance is for indies.

Sundance Now will feature more than 1,000 hours of programming, and it will now have curated collections of indie films as well as a selection of IFC titles, which also shares AMC Networks as a parent company. Each month will have a new premiere, including upcoming films like “Violent Ends,” “100 Nights of Hero,” “The Plague,” “Forbidden Fruits,” and “Over Your Dead Body.” The service will also highlight a title every Friday, and it will feature curated collections of indies, starting with movies that have been standouts at film festivals like Sundance and others. 

 










A few of the film titles that will be available at launch include “Boyhood,” “Ghostlight,” “The Babadook,” “Speak No Evil,” “How to Survive a Plague,” and “Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work.”

Sundance Now is also an official sponsor of the festival and will be hosting a panel discussion on Saturday, January 24 at 1:30pm MT in Park City. The panel, titled “Building a Home for Independent Voices & Storytelling,” will feature Jay Duplass, Amy Redford, and Natalie Erika James — whose film “Saccharine” was just acquired by Shudder ahead of its festival debut — and head of AMC Networks' IFC Entertainment Group Scott Shooman.

“As the global leader in targeted streaming, AMC Networks brings deep expertise in building streaming products that connect with passionate communities,” said Courtney Thomasma, executive vice president of AMC Networks' linear and streaming products. “We're thrilled to offer Sundance Now as a home for both filmmakers and film enthusiasts, leveraging our in-house film group and festival partnerships to promote access, discovery, and affinity for culture-defining stories and storytellers.”

“As audiences have more options, and become more demanding, we wanted to recreate the film festival experience by showcasing a program hand-selected across all genres, by some of the best curators in the business. Our company has built a legacy around nurturing new creative voices, thought-provoking stories, and boundary-pushing cinema. Sundance Now deepens that commitment, furthering our ability to showcase independent film across our full distribution ecosystem — from theatrical to streaming — and deliver a taste-driven gateway to audiences craving the best in independent storytelling,” said Shooman.

 










Sundance Now is available for $7.99 per month and has a 50 percent off introductory discount when using the promo code SN50.

1996

A timid teen is subjected to the romantic ministrations of a brazenly skilled young paramour and turns into a track star. A daily bus commuter slowly descends into a regular argument with an ornery old cuss who thinks the problems of today are all the fault of young people and glam rock. A street kid caught up in rough trade stops to wonder if that's all there is. A spiritual seeker goes to a priest for guidance, and receiving only useless dogma in return, decides to worship television instead.

These are just a few of the faces that show up in 1996's marvelous second LP by Belle and Sebastian. At once rousing and mournful and positively buzzing with the erotic friction of sin and salvation, If You're Feeling Sinister manifests an unarranged meeting of disparate outlaws—the lineal descendants of Bowie's pretty things, the Modern Lovers' disaffected suburban bohemians, and Paul Westerberg's invisible strivers. In 10 songs, singer-songwriter Stuart Murdoch constructs his shadow kingdom piece by piece, an emotional voting block of consummate misfits: the poor, the ugly, the queer, the socially maladroit, those for whom the compensations of contemporary life feel insufficient relative to its nonstop petty humiliations. A shimmering, comic-tragic signal flair for those who feel abandoned and a destination for those with nowhere to go.

Five months earlier, the band made waves with their frequently brilliant and charmingly homespun debut Tigermilk, which helped to establish the rough contours of Murdoch's preoccupations: dancing, dreaming, shy boys, sly girls, high-school hierarchies, the plight of the unrequited, and the sundry pilgrimages of the heart and mind. It was by any measure a strong statement of purpose, buoyant and scrappy and replete with promise. If You're Feeling Sinister was something else entirely—a streamlined juggernaut whose layered character studies were filled with exquisite literary and musical detail. Such is the power of Murdoch's storytelling that it can be easy to lose sight of the idiosyncratic brilliance of If You're Feeling Sinister's marvelously calibrated hybrid of Fairport Convention-adjacent British folk and late-period Velvet Underground surliness, a hiding-in-plain-sight aesthetic pairing that provides a rich sonic tapestry for Murdoch to embroider his outsider's guide to the galaxy. The pastoral feel of the music, and Murdoch's soft, tremulous tenor conjures Nick Drake, but the content of the songs hews closer to the urban fever dreams of Martin Amis, whose 1995 novel The Information traces similar lines of fading-empire disenfranchisement.

Stuart Murdoch is a character in his own songs, largely a comedic one, and he tends to exist at a remove. A lapsed-but-simmering Presbyterian zealot, he's always calling balls and strikes on everyone's perversions but his own. He's a strange anthropologist of the underground, a little overstimulated, thrilling to the milieu without quite jumping in—a beguiled wariness regarding the weird edges of town he shares with his Canadian contemporary Dan Bejar. He asks peculiar questions. “Have you and her been taking pictures of your obsessions?” he gently interrogates a young woman in a detective's cadence on the spectacular album opener “The Stars of Track and Field.” He'd like to know, because he has definitely been taking pictures of his. The rollicking, seasick “Seeing Other People” is a piano-driven paean to bewildering bi-curious sexual confusion, resolving around a killer punchline: “You're going to have to go with girls/You'd be better off/At least they know where to put it.”

In “Me and the Major,” a scintillating blues harp soundtracks a pointless circular disagreement with an officious Boomer as to whether the Queen's army is where one goes to learn to be a man. Where does one go to learn to be a man? Or to learn anything, for that matter? The sins of the father are cheerfully sloughed off on the son. “All the others took drugs,” Murdoch sings of the preceding generations, turned censorious in their dotage. “They're taking it out on us.” They still are to this day.

The album's title track and centerpiece is a five-minute-twenty-second series of perfect, steel-guitar abetted snapshots of doomed characters adrift in spiritual crisis, seeking nourishment from religious institutions that traffic largely in corrupt predation and outdated ritual. All around there is the pre-Brexit feeling of Potemkin institutions of church and state, lost somewhere in the deafening reverberations of history, insufficient to meet the physical and psychic needs of a younger generation:

“Hillary went to the Catholic church because she wanted informationThe vicar or whatever took her to one side and gave her confirmationSt. Theresa's calling herThe church up on the hill is looking lovelyBut it didn't interestThe only thing she wants to knowIs how and why and when and where to goHow and why and when and where to follow”

At times, critics have interpreted Murdoch's songs as compositionally simple—a spare edifice around which to hang his stories and aphorisms, with backing crew providing their baroque but down-home orchestral support. I suspect this has something to do with their nominal relationship to the “twee” movement, a specific kind of aggressive guilelessness that ran through Scotland's Postcard Records and Olympia, Washington's K label. Those kinds of records—Talulah Gosh and Beat Happening—tended to the lo-fi and amateurish as a point of pride. No doubt, some of that filtered through to Murdoch, but it did not emerge in simplicity of arrangement. Indeed, the thorniest of Murdoch's tunes here—the galvanizing keep-yourself-safe “Like Dylan in the Movies” or the passive-aggressive devotional “Mayfly”—are as delightfully and compositionally difficult as your average Todd Rundgren song.

In his late 20s at the time, Murdoch was commencing a staggering hot streak that would last roughly a decade. A couple Belle and Sebastian LPs during this stretch would suffer from the decision to delegate several songs to sundry bandmates, particularly 2000's uneven Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant, which shines on Murdoch's material and is considerably diminished by lesser contributions by Stevie Jackson, Isobel Campbell, and Sarah Martin. Who knows the reasons for this choice—band dynamics are a psychedelic kaleidoscope of competing imperatives—but whatever the case, by 2003's Dear Catastrophe Waitress, Murdoch had been largely restored to creative primacy, on both that record and The Life Pursuit. Such a decade-long streak is historically unusual. Sly Stone from 1967 to 1976. Joni Mitchell from 1968 to 1977. Dylan, a couple of different times. Anyway, If You're Feeling Sinister launched the band into a rarified air from which it would not soon descend. Thirty years later, the group has evolved into the very sort of communal institution and devoted cult that Murdoch dared dream into reality.

After all of the bone-deep hooks, ribald jokes, and meticulous world-building, If You're Feeling Sinister ends on the sort of galvanizing grace note that used to come so easily to Morrissey, before his hardwired paranoia finally overtook his vaulting compassion. With its lilting, sing-song progression and vaguely goofy brass interlude, “Judy and the Dream of Horses” is a sweet-natured mash note to a bookish teenage rebel, the sort who is equally interested in S&M and Bible studies, who maybe wants to know how and why and when and where to follow. Don't follow, Murdoch seems to tell her: Lead.

Arctic Monkeys have returned with a new song. “Opening Night,” their first release since 2022's The Car, appears on a forthcoming benefit album for the UK-based children's charity War Child. Listen to it below.

The band recorded the track at Abbey Road Studios as part of the new compilation HELP(2), due out March 6 on War Child Records. The record also features contributions from Big Thief, Cameron Winter, Arooj Aftab and Beck, Olivia Rodrigo, Sampha, King Krule, Depeche Mode and Black Country, New Road. The Zone Of Interest director Jonathan Glazer served as its creative director.

HELP(2) draws inspiration from the 1995 charity compilation HELP, which was recorded in a single day to to raise money for War Child's humanitarian aid in Bosnia. It included songs from Radiohead, Oasis, Massive Attack, and Sinead O'Connor. Now, HELP(2) is raising money to support War Child's continued work in conflict zones.

Nominations for the 2026 Academy Awards have landed. Actors Danielle Brooks and Lewis Pullman announced them during an event on Thursday, January 22. Explore a full list of nominees below.

Ryan Coogler's Sinners picked up a record 16 nominations, including one for Best Picture, where it comeptes alongside Marty Supreme, One Battle After Another, Bugonia, Sentimental Value, and Hamnet, among others. Each of them picked up a strong haul of overall nods (though, perplexingly, Daniel Lopatin's excellent Marty Supreme score went unrecognized). Wicked: For Good was also snubbed, picking up a grand total of zero nominations despite having two tracks shortlisted for Best Original Song. Conan O'Brien is hosting the ceremony, which takes place on March 15 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.

At last year's ceremony, Sean Baker's film Anora led the pack with five wins: Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Picture. Daniel Blumberg took home a Best Original Score statuette for his work on Brady Corbet's The Brutalist. Best Original Song went to“El Mal,” from Jacques Audiard's cartel musical Emilia Perez.

The 2026 Academy Award nominations were announced today, and with them, the contenders for Best Original Song. This year's nominees are Nick Cave and Bryce Dessner's “Train Dreams” (from the film of the same name), Huntr/x's “Golden” (KPop Demon Hunters), Raphael Saadiq and Ludwig Göransson's “I Lied to You” (Sinners), Dianne Warren's “Dear Me” (Dianne Warren: Relentless), and Nicholas Pike's “Sweet Dreams of Joy” (Viva Verdi!). A winner will be named at the awards ceremony on Sunday, March 15, hosted by Conan O'Brien at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.

Göransson was the only artist to be nominated for both Best Original Song and Best Original Score this year. Back in December, the Academy shared a shortlist of songs in the running for a nomination. Among those that didn't make the final cut were Nine Inch Nails' “As Alive as You Need Me to Be” (Tron: Ares), Aiyana-Lee's “Highest 2 Lowest,” Miley Cyrus' “Dream as One” (Avatar: Fire and Ash), John Mayer, Ed Sheeran, and Blake Slatkin's “Drive” (F1), and two songs from Wicked: For Good. In 2025, the award went to Clément Ducol, Camille, and Jacques Audiard for “El Mal,” from Audiard's musical drama Emilia Perez.

Sassy 009 was once a trio of classmates from Oslo: three cool, elusive voices swirling and stuttering against a gentle barrage of programmed ploinks, like club music by the jaded girls sitting at the back of the room. Then ringleader Sunniva Lindgård, who took the alias from an old SoundCloud handle, shed her counterparts (and some of the frosty detachment) and went solo. In 2021, Heart Ego inflamed her sound with shocks of color and dance pop as energetic as Cowgirl Clue. Lindgård took four years to return with Dreamer+, which at times sounds more like a nightmare. Pulling from a morass of trendy club pop and trip-hop tropes, she's homing in on brash, flashy thrills and injecting them with darkside dissonance.

The often cryptic narrative seems to chart the highs and lows of a doomed relationship, one where the protagonist needs their partner to leave in order to evolve as a person. The fictional narrator, played by Lindgård, is “free fall aiming for your arms tonight” and finding adoration in her lover Jakov's eyes. But she feels an overwhelming sense of despair and eventually “kills Jakov with nothing more than a thought,” as she states at the record's end, before abrasive noise consumes her voice. According to the press release, the story involves a fairytale with mutating characters, and the narrator is supposed to be on a mission in an abandoned town, although none of that is really discernible from the music. Instead there's a lot of yearning and uneasiness and irresolution. Some standout lyrics send obliquely suggestive images fluttering through the brain (“swoosh community,” “a silent triple face,” “television, chilling sugaboo in a cage forgets”).

Mostly, the vocals poof up and twinkle like plumes of vapor; they work best when she experiments with her flow. Auto-Tune magic and formant freakiness light up “Butterflies,” where Lindgård sings in a herky-jerky rhythm that's like cyberpunk slam poetry. The sparse wintry sweep of “In the Snow” provides the perfect backdrop for Lindgård's crinkling, pixelated inflection. On “Edges,” a doomscroller's aging-out anthem, her voice cuts through the fog with a surprisingly intimate “Hey there you, you.” As much as she fucks up and filters her voice, it all starts to blend into the same genre of misty freakout by the end of the record—ad-libs spraying like raindrops on the windshield, chopped-up slivers of angel warbles, dragged-out sighs. Even the guest features are reverbed to oblivion. Blood Orange sings gently over “Tell Me,” which has the uneasy churn of a Moin track but with the serrated edge aggressively softened.

Much of the production is supremely pleasant to listen to, but just as hazy and confused as the plot, splitting between spacey expanses of synth and dramatic eruptions. “Enemy” starts with 30 seconds of pure gloomy ambience before detonating into a kind of trap drum hook, where she repeats, “Are you an enemy?” over a beat that doesn't offer full weird-pop gratification à la “Noid” but also isn't texturally intoxicating (though the way she shadows every line with “I don't know” is delicious). “Dreamer” offers formless dream-hop filler and “My Candle” hints at a grunge-gaze blaze, then just hurls more thwacky breakbeats. Maybe the most ungainly yet conceptually cool is “Butterflies,” the musical equivalent of undergoing transhumanist surgery from man to machine. Revving cars and cyborgian synths give way to a monstrous terror-bass sound so gurgly it's like Lindgård's duetting with a cartoon rapper from Friday Night Funkin'.

In the last few years, Scandinavia has become the global center for all manner of uncanny cloud rock and ambient pop wonder, from the dreamy Danes to screw-pop savants like Smerz. Digital-analog trickery and aching minimalism have taken over indie scenes across the world, catalogued by amorphous playlists like Spotify's “Cph+” (“Copenhagen plus”), of which Lindgård is now the cover. In this album's least inventive moments, it's like a focus-grouped version of that alternative, gently askew style, a 2020s parallel to the vibey indie-pop made to fit the infamous POLLEN playlist. The impersonal trip-hop pales in comparison to a.s.o.; the slanted R&B of tracks like “Mirrors” mostly makes you want to listen to Tirzah, and the witch-house doom doesn't go as hard as E_DEATH. In many cases, someone else did it first, someone else did it better, and the lack of graspable depth from the plot means the album lacks real stakes.

One standout is “Ruins of a Lost Memory.” Surrounded by orchestras since the womb, Lindgård is the child of two classically trained musicians who once submitted a song to a Eurovision contest in the 1990s. They didn't make the cut, but Lindgård—who holds complicated feelings about picking the gaudy thrills of EDM and pop over her parents' discipline—samples their melody for an anachronistic yet strangely alluring piano ballad. Maybe it's here as an ode to where she came from, or a comment on the classical route she refused and all the twitchy and turbulent digital chaos she chose to explore instead. It's a concrete, compelling closer to an album that otherwise slips from memory as swiftly as a dream.

Sinners made Oscar history with a remarkable 16 nominations, while One Battle After Another came in right behind with 13 as the nominees for the 98th Academy Awards were announced Thursday, Jan. 22.


Ryan Coogler's blues-inspired vampire flick and Paul Thomas Anderson's family drama/political thriller will compete for Best Picture, while both filmmakers are up for Best Director. In Best Picture, Sinners and One Battle are up against Bugonia, F1, Frankenstein, Hamnet, Marty Supreme, The Secret Agent, Sentimental Value, and Train Dreams.


	The 16 nominations earned by Sinners make it the most nominated film in Oscars history, surpassing the three films that had previously secured 14 nods (All About Eve, Titanic, and La La Land). Along with Best Picture and Director, Michael B. Jordan was nominated for Best Actor, while Delroy Lindo and Wunmi Mosaku received recognition for their supporting performances. The film also earned nominations for Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Song (for “I Lied to You”), Best Original Score, and a host of production and technical categories.

	As for One Battle After Another, its stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn, and Teyana Taylor all scored acting nominations. Anderson also picked up a Best Adapted Screenplay nomination (the film is inspired by Thomas Pynchon's novel Vineland), while Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood — a frequent Anderson collaborator — earned a nod for his original score.

	











Sinners leading all nominees by a record-breaking margin could shake up the Oscar race, which seemed destined to come down to One Battle After Another and Chloe Zhao's Hamnet (the two films recently shared the Best Picture spoils at the Golden Globes). Hamnet earned eight nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress for Jessie Buckley, and Best Adapted Screenplay.


	Elsewhere, three films picked up nine nominations each: Josh Safdie's Marty Supreme, Guillermo Del Toro's Frankenstein, and Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value. Timothée Chalamet secured his second Best Actor nod in a row for his performance in Safdie's edge-of-your-seat pingpong flick, with the star slated to compete against Jordan, DiCaprio, Ethan Hawke for Blue Moon, and Wagner Moura for The Secret Agent.

Sentimental Value's four main stars all received Oscar nods: Elle Fanning, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, and Stellan Skarsgård for their supporting performances, and Renate Reinsve for Best Actress. Reinsve will compete against Buckley, Rose Byrne for If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, Kate Hudson for Song Sung Blue, and Emma Stone for Bugonia. 


	Other notable nominees include Amy Madigan, who received a Best Supporting Actress nod for her turn in Weapons, 40 years after she was last nominated in the same category for Twice in a Lifetime. Jacob Elordi earned his first Oscar nomination for his performance in Frankenstein. And breakout hit Kpop Demon Hunters picked up two nominations, one for Best Animated Feature, and another for Best Original Song for “Golden.”


	Speaking of Best Original Song: for the ninth year in a row, and 17th time ever, Diane Warren is nominated in that category. This time, she's up for “Dear Me,” a song she wrote for a documentary about herself, Diane Warren: Relentless. While Warren has yet to win a competitive Oscar, she did receive an Honorary Award in 2022.


	The 98th Oscars will also see the introduction of a new prize, Best Casting, which is the first new category to be added to the Academy Awards in more than 20 years (the last being Best Animated Feature Film, established in 2001). The inaugural nominees for the prize are Hamnet, Marty Supreme, One Battle After Another, The Secret Agent, and Sinners.

	The United States may feel like it's on the brink of a civil war led by its own government, but one thing Americans seem to agree on in our nation's bisesquicentennial year is the peaceful, easy feeling we all get from the Eagles‘ early years. The RIAA announced on Thursday that the group's first compilation, Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975) (1976), had become the first LP in history to be christened quadruple diamond by the RIAA. The certification signifies that the band has sold more than 40 million copies of the LP, officially making it the bestselling album of all time.


	Runner-up to the Eagles, of course, remains Michael Jackson‘s Thriller (1982), which retains its 34x platinum status, certified in 2021. And in third place? Well, gee … (blushes, adjusts tie), it's the Eagles again, this time with Hotel California, which, as of Thursday, is now freshly certified 28x platinum. That achievement, of course, is due to the Eagles' greatest hits capping things off in 1975, a year before Hotel California came out, making it so you need both if you're a real Eagles fan.

	











	For Eagles singer-songwriter Don Henley, who recognized another milestone (Greatest Hits came out nearly half a century ago on Feb. 17, 1976), quadruple diamond status is a cultural victory. “In an age, in a culture, where everything seems to become more ephemeral, by the day, it is gratifying to have been part of something that endures, even for 50 years,” he said in a statement to The Associated Press. “We are amazed and grateful.”

	The band is celebrating by re-releasing Greatest Hits on clear, heavyweight vinyl and performing another 12 gigs at the Sphere in Las Vegas. The residency begins Friday and features four dates this month, another four each in February and March.


The AP notes that while RIAA diamond certifications once represented the sale of 10 million physical albums, the company has since changed its thresholds for the streaming era. Beginning in 2013, certifications now recognize streaming equivalents, drawing from plays on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music. If you stream an album 1,500 times, and Eagles fans apparently have, that is now equal to one album sale.

							By 

	Nancy Dillon



	Three months after a federal judge dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group, the superstar rapper and his lawyers filed an opening appellate brief Wednesday that seeks to overturn the ruling and revive his bid for damages over Kendrick Lamar's Grammy-winning diss track, “Not Like Us.”


	In the new 60-page brief obtained by Rolling Stone, Drake argues that Lamar's track states, as an “unambiguous matter of fact,” that he is a “certified pedophile.” He also claims Universal Music Group “relentlessly” marketed the song in a way that misled consumers and caused him serious harm. The brief contends that the allegation carries a “precise” and readily understood meaning that is “capable of being proven true or false,” a point the district court previously acknowledged, according to the filing.


	Drake also claims that the dismissal of his lawsuit could have far-reaching consequences. By ruling that rap diss tracks are non-actionable opinion, the lower court created a “dangerous categorical rule” that would shield artists and labels from defamation liability regardless of how direct or damaging a statement might be, he argues. “The court effectively created an unprecedented and overbroad categorical rule that statements in rap diss tracks can never constitute statements of fact,” his brief claims.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Drake previously filed his notice of appeal on Nov. 12 in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, signaling he would challenge the Oct. 9 decision by U.S. District Court Judge Jeannette A. Vargas. In her ruling, Judge Vargas concluded that Lamar's lyrics accusing Drake of pedophilia were “nonactionable opinion” rather than statements of fact.

	











	“The issue in this case is whether ‘Not Like Us' can reasonably be understood to convey as a factual matter that Drake is a pedophile or that he has engaged in sexual relations with minors,” Judge Vargas wrote. “In light of the overall context in which the statements in the recording were made, the court holds that it cannot.”

	She said the “broader context” of the song was “a heated rap battle, with incendiary language and offensive accusations hurled by both participants,” adding that it “would not incline the reasonable listener to believe that ‘Not Like Us' imparts verifiable facts.”


	But in his Wednesday filing, Drake says the song's repeated references to pedophilia, combined with its “ubiquitous cover art,” and subsequently released viral video, plausibly convey a false statement of fact that should be decided by a jury. Drake's appeal asks the court to send the case back, insisting that his claim he was defamed by “Not Like Us” is a question to be decided at trial, not in a motion to dismiss.


	Drake, whose legal name is Aubrey Drake Graham, sued UMG last January, accusing the label of promoting Lamar's hit song in a way that “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal pedophile.” He notably sued only the record label he shares with Lamar, not Lamar himself.


UMG responded with a scathing motion to dismiss that ultimately prevailed. “Plaintiff, one of the most successful recording artists of all time, lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated,” lawyers for UMG wrote. “Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.”

	The nine-track rap battle at the center of the legal war started making headlines in April 2024. It exploded when Drake released “Family Matters” on May 3, 2024. The song insinuated that Lamar had cheated on his fiancée and was physically violent with her. Lamar responded with the back-to-back drops of “Meet the Grahams” and “Not Like Us,” with the latter's hook of “certified lover boy, certified pedophile” becoming an instant and viral sensation.


	“Not Like Us” went on to win Grammy Awards for record and song of the year last February. Lamar also performed the song during last year's Super Bowl halftime show.

	“People thought I would use force. I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force.”


	This statement, made by President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, generated a collective sigh of relief in Europe and America. The worst-case scenario — the United States attacking one of its NATO allies to seize territory — seems to be off the table.


	For now.


	“All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,” Trump added.


	Despite signs of a burgeoning deal with Denmark to placate him, there will be a long reckoning for the unnecessary crisis manufactured by the American president. The damage is already done. Many American allies look at the U.S. with increasing dismay and wariness.


	“The problem isn't Trump. The problem is the U.S.,” writes Lars Christensen, a Danish economist who runs the financial advisory firm Paice. “When the outside world observes Trump's insane behavior and his threats against allies, and we at the same time observe that there is no real action from the U.S. public, Congress, the U.S. Supreme Court, or the U.S. media about this insanity, we will all have to conclude that the U.S. accepts this behavior.”

	











	This sentiment has been echoed to Rolling Stone in several candid conversations with European officials and analysts.


	“There is a much bigger problem than anyone wants to admit,” says one Swedish security official with experience working with the Trump administration. “Even aside from Greenland, it is clear to us that Washington is not on the same page as the rest of NATO, no matter what the president says. We fear this will be an issue for years to come.”

	











	The Greenland crisis entered its apogee on Sunday, when Trump sent a now infamous letter addressed to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, and distributed widely to European diplomats by the U.S. State Department. It demanded Greenland as compensation for Trump's lack of a Nobel Peace Prize, written in Trump's preferred informal style, random noun-capitalization and all.

	“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote.


	“I have done more for NATO than any person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States,” he continued. “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.”


	That the president decided to bring Norway into the picture — as Greenland is a semi-autonomous part of Denmark, a completely different country – is a sign of either the president's ignorance or obsession with the Peace Prize — or both.


	The self-absorbed derangement on display in this missive caught even stalwart Trump supporters off guard, with some initially decrying its message and asserting the letter must surely be a hoax. Upon learning it most assuredly was not, they promptly flip-flopped to defend the “genius move.” Such is the high-wire balancing act required of one who supports a president who — politics aside — has a mind that has passed its recommended “Use By” date.


	Trump's veiled threat to abandon peace was reinforced by his subsequent refusal to rule out a military option. When NBC News asked him on Tuesday if he would use force to seize Greenland, Trump replied simply: “No comment.”

	To add insult to injury, Trump further insisted that the U.S. has gotten “nothing” out of NATO. This is a slap in the face to America's NATO allies, who sacrificed more than 1,000 soldiers in the U.S. war in Afghanistan, and especially to Denmark, which sent 18,000 soldiers there — with 43 never coming home.


	“Every day Trump remains in office, distrust of the U.S. increases, and the cost for the U.S. will go up day by day. And this is irreversible. It takes years to build trust, but you can destroy it by your actions in minutes,” the economist Christensen observes.


	Military action against Greenland would almost certainly spell NATO's doom, which is unlikely to have bothered the U.S. president, who has never been a fan of the alliance — judged by most historians to be the most successful pact in history

	











	As far back as 1987, after a visit to Moscow to pursue investment opportunities, Trump spent nearly $100,000 (about $285,000 in today's dollars) on full-page ads inveighing against the alliance. He has now surrounded himself with vocal critics of both the European Union and of NATO.


	Trump's bull-in-the-china-shop efforts to pull out of NATO unless member states picked up more of the tab for their defense — a refrain since his first term in office began nearly 10 years ago — have yielded results. Overall, defense spending by NATO members has increased markedly, but much of that is driven less by American prodding, and more by concern over Russia's invasion of Ukraine starting in 2022.


	But Trump was never really interested in other countries' military spending. That is something tacked on to his anti-alliance antics by more responsible policymakers within the White House. In any case, destroying NATO would be a strange way to reform it — although not out of character for an administration that has methodically dismantled sources of American global influence and soft power.


	Hard power, Trump and his cohorts believe, is the only currency that matters. Riding high on the martial prowess displayed by Special Operations Command in kidnapping the Venezuelan president a mere two weeks ago, it shouldn't then be surprising that Trump is now emboldened to throw his weight around and bully whomever he wishes.


	That obviously does not include Russian President Vladimir Putin. After a year of failed diplomacy, Trump appears to have finally accepted that his sycophantic goodwill to the Kremlin's dictator will not be reciprocated with a peace deal in Ukraine. He still has yet to enact secondary sanctions on Russia. Despite supposedly giving a greenlight to a sanctions bill intended to squeeze Russian energy revenues, it continues to languish in congressional limbo.


	In fact, Trump is far more focused on getting Putin to join his “Board of Peace.” This organization — ostensibly proposed to work for a permanent solution to the crisis in Gaza — has been revealed as little more than an grift. The board's charter and invitation letters made public by various world leaders outline what sounds like a pay-for-play exclusive networking club — with membership to the tune of $1 billion a pop and Trump as chairman for life.


	Many prominent leaders, such as French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have already turned it down. But if Putin does decide to accede, he will join the leader of the free world at the table with such champions of liberty as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

	











	“We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false, that the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient, that trade rules were enforced asymmetrically,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a speech at Davos on Tuesday. “And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or the victim.”


	“This fiction was useful, and American hegemony, in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes,” Carney said. “This bargain no longer works. Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.”


	However one feels about the neo-liberal world order that America has dominated for decades, you needn't look too deeply into the historical record to understand that when established orders collapse, it means more war, greater economic hardship and scarcity, and less freedom.


	It will also mean more nukes, as an array of nations previously protected by America's nuclear umbrella seek the ultimate security guarantee — something already being contemplated, from Seoul to Stockholm.


	Trump's push for Greenland is against a backdrop in which authoritarian states are attempting a revolutionary re-ordering of the global system, returning humanity to a world of armed imperialism in which the strong consume the weak. Whether this can correctly be called Realism on the part of the U.S. is debatable; a key aspect of such a philosophy is the pursuit of self-interest, not self-sabotage.


	In an upside-down world, madness is painted as strategy, while provincialism and ignorance are touted as sophistication and wisdom. Hubris is paraded as strength. But hubris is ever the precursor to downfall.


	For now, despite these seismic shocks permanently altering America's trajectory with its allies, Trump's speech in Davos contained the magic formula to generate relief on both sides of the Atlantic: “I will not use force.”

	Which is good, because if the president were to dispatch the U.S. Army's 11th Airborne Division, the “Arctic Angels,” to seize Greenland's largest airbase, the soldiers might be in for a surprise.


	Under an existing agreement with Denmark, it's already defended by the U.S. Space Force.

	Don't invite Martin Short to your wedding. The comedian appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night and explained that he was slightly misbehaved at the much-publicized nuptials of Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco last year. 


	Short described Gomez, his co-star on Only Murders in the Building, as “an extra child of mine.” “I adore her so much, and she found this guy and he's the greatest guy,” Short told Jimmy Kimmel. “They have the greatest hang and they're wildly in love. So the wedding was perfect and it was beautiful.”


	He explained that on the night of the reception, which was held outdoors in Santa Barbara under a group of tents, he made a misstep. “It was a big, big party,” he said. “Imagine a stage and dance floor and musicians and big, big tents. And at the back of the tent were these individual seating areas with couches and chairs.”


	Short's group of friends from Only Murders in the Building, including Steve Martin and Paul Rudd, gathered in one of these areas. Also in the area: a small wedding cake. “I just assumed there was a wedding cake for each section,” Short said. When Martin said he was leaving, Short, a few cocktails in and fork in hand, said, “Oh Steve, you can't leave yet without a piece of wedding cake.” 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“And I cut the wedding cake on one side and then cut it on the other, and then all the people in our group screamed, ‘Marty!'” he recalled. “It was the wedding cake.” Kimmel showed a photo of the mangled cake, which Short had tried to repair with his fork. “This was bad,” Short admitted. “This was about an hour before it was to be presented.”

	











	Although Short considered just leaving, the chef was able to mostly repair it and Gomez and Blanco cut the cake as usual when it was time. “It ended up being very like a Hollywood wedding cake in that it was beautiful but now it had had a little work done,” Short said. 


	Short and Martin wanted to keep the incident a secret from Gomez. “But then as I was leaving Selena came by [and said], ‘Hey Marty, I hear you tried to eat my cake!'” Short said.

	Gomez and Blanco officially tied the knot in a private ceremony on Sept. 27. The couple got engaged in December 2024 after more than a year of dating. The wedding included numerous famous attendees, including Taylor Swift, who gave a speech. 


	“I did make a speech, but I actually made a point not to mention anything about my engagement,” Swift recalled on The Tonight Show afterwards. “I did do some light teasing about the way we used to dress in 2008, the year that we met. Because we met when we were teenagers in 2008. It was quite a year. Let me tell you. It was the year of deep, deep V-necks.”

R.A.D's striking running shoe is impressive


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


It isn't easy to break into the running shoe market. It's an area that's already saturated with excellent options from well-established brands with huge research and marketing budgets, and a customer base that tends to stay loyal to brands they've used in the past.

There are relatively recent success stories like Hoka and On, who have both broken through to become major running brands with innovative designs. Both brands used visually striking shoes to stand out on the market too, and that's a playbook that R.A.D seems to have adopted with its first dedicated running shoe.

The UFO is a delightfully bouncy running shoe with a distinctive design. It's very cushioned and comfortable, but still light and springy enough for faster runs, making it a versatile option for your training.

The R.A.D UFO certainly catches the eye, with its bright colors and curvy geometry. R.A.D did launch the R-1 hybrid training shoe last year, which worked for runs as well as gym workouts, but the UFO is purely aimed at runners, and indeed built to rival the best running shoes on the market with a high price tag of $200.

When the UFO landed on my doorstep I was skeptical. I've not used R.A.D shoes before but in my experience, running shoes from gym-focused brands have been underwhelming. The looks were also a little off-putting, as was the price.

However, I've loved every step in the shoe, and I do think it's one of the outstanding options on the market thanks to its springy, fun ride. Here's four things I liked about the R.A.D UFO, and two things I'm less keen on.

 




The main reason I like the UFO is its bouncy ride. It's exceptionally springy thanks to the SUPEFOAM midsole, which is made up of two layers of PEBA foam, and delivers a high amount of energy return.

There are very few shoes that are as soft and springy as the UFO, and for R.A.D to have developed such impressive midsole foams in its first true running shoe is remarkable.

Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.

 




There's a lot of foam in the midsole of the UFO, which stands 42mm high at the heel and has an 8mm drop, and you feel the benefit of all that cushioning on long runs in particular.

Despite the max-stack design, the UFO is pretty light, tipping the scales at 9.4oz in my US men's size 10.

Its combination of cushioning and bounce in a light design make the UFO enjoyable for all kinds of runs at different paces — it's a great do-it-all option for runners who don't use a running shoe rotation.

 




The pronounced rocker on the UFO is not just there to make its design even more striking, it makes the ride of the shoe very smooth whether you're running easy or hard.

I was a little worried that the dramatic shape of the rocker might make the UFO feel too unnatural on the run, but it works well and makes the ride more enjoyable on long runs in particular.

 




The outsole on the UFO is modest in the amount of rubber used, but the main impact areas around the heel and forefoot are covered.

Having run over 40 miles in the shoe in exclusively wet conditions — that's the British winter for you — I can confirm that the grip is reliable even when running at faster paces.

 




The UFO is bouncy and pretty light, but the very wide sections at the heel and forefoot mean that you feel its size during runs at faster paces.

I enjoyed using it for tempo runs, but for faster interval runs I prefer a nimbler shoe that's both lighter and narrower, like the Asics Megablast.

 




The price is high, but I think the UFO lives up to it with its performance — rivals like the Megablast are even more expensive.

A bigger barrier to people buying and using the UFO might well be its looks. While many will love the distinctive design, many runners might well prefer to use a more normal-looking running shoe.

I'd say it works for R.A.D to make a shoe that looks so different as a debut, but I'd be keen to see a more traditional-looking sneaker that uses this excellent midsole foam in the future.

The University Teachers' Network today demanded immediate reinstatement of two faculty members of the University of Asia Pacific (UAP), terming their dismissal ""a surrender to mob intimidation and a serious violation of academic freedom and due process"".

The demand was made at a press conference held at Jatiya Press Club this afternoon, where a written statement was read out by teachers.

The speakers protested the termination of Layeqa Bashir, an assistant professor of sociology at UAP's Department of Basic Sciences and Humanities, and ASM Mohsin, an associate professor, head of the department, and former director of the Directorate of Student Welfare.

Reading out the statement, the network placed a four-point demand, calling for the immediate reinstatement of both teachers, an end to harassment of teachers and students who protested the decision. They also demanded what they described as punishment for those involved in organised intimidation and false allegations, and the enforcement of clear policies to ensure job security, due process and academic freedom in universities.

The dismissal of the two UAP teachers, is the latest example of this trend, the statement read.

Layeqa came under attack following a Facebook post that, according to the statement, was written from a security-related concern and not from a religious standpoint.

A section of current and former students portrayed the post as hurting religious sentiment and launched a campaign of online harassment, much of it driven by anonymous and fake accounts, the statement said.

Despite issuing a clarification, Layeqa continued to face pressure. Instead of verifying the complaints, the university administration allegedly asked her over the phone to resign.

Fearing for her safety, she lodged a general diary with Tejgaon Police Station, after which the university formed an inquiry committee.

The speakers criticised the inquiry process, saying that the committee sought complaints through a Google Form and received around 34 anonymous responses, making verification impossible.

Regarding Mohsin, the statement said he was dismissed without any show-cause notice or investigation, allegedly after being labelled a supporter of the former Awami League regime, despite his role in standing with students during the July uprising.

Economist Anu Muhammad, Professor Samina Luthfa of Dhaka University, and Professor Mirza Taslima Sultana of Jahangirnagar University were present at the press conference.

Kajalie Shehreen Islam, associate professor of Dhaka University; Shamali Shill, associate professor of Jagannath University; Kamal Uddin Ahmed Chowdhury, professor of Dhaka University; and Tanvir Sobhan, senior lecturer of BRAC University, were also present.

Netflix's hit show Stranger Things has set viewership records with its fifth and final season — and now the National Enquirer can reveal the '80s-set paranormal drama is based on a real CIA program that used psychically gifted individuals to spy on the Soviet Union.

In the blockbuster show, Millie Bobby Brown's Jane Hopper, better known as Eleven or El, belongs to a secret CIA operation based in fictional Hawkins, Ind., but escapes and joins a crew of mischievous and heroic local kids who battle monsters from another dimension.

Eleven is shown using a combination of ESP and remote viewing and sensory deprivation — such as being submerged in a makeshift float tank — to remotely locate creatures and people, including a Russian spy.

But what most people don't know is that the U.S. government, first through the Defense Intelligence Agency and later under the CIA, used psychics to do the very same thing from 1977 to 1995.

Project Stargate — initially based out of Fort Meade, Md. — tasked psychics with spying on objects, locations and people sometimes located thousands of miles away.

In one incredible success story, psychic Rosemary Smith telepathically found a crashed Soviet Tu-95 bomber in a mountainous area of Zaire, allowing the U.S. to plunder the plane's wreckage before Russian agents arrived, sources say.

As the Enquirer previously reported, recently declassified CIA files show that a remote viewer once described an alien base hidden inside a rocky mountain in Alaska that is believed to be Mount Hayes — a spot long associated with UFO sightings.

Sources say the Stargate program's results were believed to be legit, but the CIA ultimately shuttered the operation after an independent audit by the American Institutes for Research (AIR) found that the psychic visions were too “vague and ambiguous” and not sufficiently actionable to warrant the operation's exorbitant costs.

“It remains unclear whether the existence of a paranormal phenomenon, remote viewing, has been demonstrated,” AIR's report concluded, even though the organization's analysts conceded in the same write-up that “something beyond odd statistical hiccups is taking place.”

Speculation surrounding the existence of alien life has dominated conspiracy conversations for decades now, yet these rumors might just have more to them than you think, as the Bank of England has issued a warning.

It often goes hand in hand that people both believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life and that the government is trying to cover it up, which is why secret military bases like Area 51 have built up such mythos.

Alien hunters are dedicated to their belief that there's life out there, often visiting the most common UFO sighting spots and delving deep into the current so-called evidence of alien life throughout history.

If it is true that the 'truth' is being obscured by major governments, then there's little that the average person can do. But people might have received a hint that something major could be announced in the near future.

Advert

As shared by LADbible, the Bank of England has been warned by a former key employee to prepare for the possibility that the United States government will announce the existence of alien life, forecasting a market crash if that information was revealed.

Relayed by Douglas Macgregor on X, a former senior analyst in financial security at the Bank of England, Helen McCaw has urged her former employer and Andrew Bailey, the bank's current governor, to 'organize contingencies' if this jaw-dropping reveal occurs.

Of course, this isn't strictly a confirmation that an announcement is on the way – as even if you take it at face value, it's merely a means of preparing for all eventualities to reduce risk – but many have taken it as further proof that there's more going on than we might be led to believe.

It's unclear what the 'contingency plan' for the Bank of England would be if aliens are revealed, and some are even unconvinced that the market would move that much in response to the news, regardless of how shocking it would be in practice.

""It would be a small reaction at most,"" predicts one investor on X, qualifying that ""if there's an alien invasion, then markets crash, yes.""

Another noted that ""even hypothetical disclosures can move markets. This says less about aliens — and more about how fragile confidence and expectations really are.""

Others on Reddit are speculating that the US government and President Donald Trump might be motivated to reveal news as big as this to 'distract' from the bad publicity surrounding both the attempted claim of Greenland and the continued pressure of the Epstein files.

""Holy. F***. They'll do anything to take attention away from the Epstein/Trump files,"" writes one commenter, with another speculating that ""those Epstein files must be really, really bad.""

A third offered a different perspective, arguing that they're ""so tired of this. Just spill the beans, get it over with.”

They concluded: “After a few days of being in the headlines it will just be another normal ho hum item in the news feeds.""

There are arguably few bigger and more shocking news stories than confirmation of extraterrestrial life, yet who knows if something even bigger is around the corner, considering current trends.

The internet has been going wild over the latest update in the Beckham family feud saga.

There's been a whole bunch of chatter online regarding the famous British it-couple, David and Victoria, along with their four children; Brooklyn, 26, Romeo, 23, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 14.

Now, rumours of an alleged family fall-out between the couple and their eldest, Brooklyn, have been brewing for years now but everything came to a head on Monday (19 January) when he took to Instagram to share a series of bombshell claims about 'Brand Beckham' and how his parents have reportedly impacted his relationship with his wife Nicola Peltz, with whom he tied the knot back in 2022.

Fellow celebs, ex-partners, fans and critics alike have been sharing their two cents on the matter, including a 'psychic' who made quite the eerie family prediction about the family-of-six weeks before Brooklyn released his statements, which referenced wedding dress speculation and Brooklyn and Nicola's first dance drama.

Earlier this month (3 January), Mamamia's 'resident psychic', Evelyn Santoro, told the outlet a little more about her thoughts on the 'Beckham family succession'.

""By June 2026, the Nicola Peltz–Victoria Beckham dynamic doesn't explode. It's quite the opposite; it freezes,"" she explained.

""No reconciliation, no fiery escalation, just cold distance. Here we'll see two strong brands refusing to bend. But there will be strained peace through separation, not resolution.""

According to the self-proclaimed psychic, matriarch Victoria, who has her own fashion label, will similarly 'face her own challenges'.

Evelyn claimed that, by August 2026, Victoria will hit 'fashion fatigue'.

""And the empire shows visible strain,"" she continued. ""It won't collapse, but contract. Fewer collections, strategic scaling back.""

Flash-forward a few more months, and Evelyn reckons we'll see the Beckham family 'operating under a new hierarchy'.

""David and Victoria: legacy protectors; Brooklyn and Nicola: separate power unit; Romeo and Cruz: the flexible duo; Harper: shielded from cameras,"" she noted, adding: ""This is the real succession story; the Beckham's transition from one family brand to multiple orbiting ones.

""An emerging dynasty.""

Now, just because a so-called psychic 'predicted' such events doesn't necessarily mean they are bound to happen, but internet sleuths will no doubt find the timings interesting.

In his statement, which was delivered across six text posts on his Instagram Stories, Brooklyn claimed: ""Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed.""

He added: ""I do not want to reconcile with my family. I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life.

""For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into.

""Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.""

(BLKIIBLK/Frontiers)Tuneful yet overlong, Dave Mustaine and co's final album is a recap of Megadeth's strengths, flaws and familiar grudges

There are long goodbyes, and then there is Megadeth's retirement from the music industry. A final album and tour by the thrash metal pioneers was announced last August, with an AI-assisted video and a written statement that offered some classic grandstanding on the part of frontman and sole original member Dave Mustaine. Never a man to hide his light under a bushel, he equated Megadeth's decision to quit with a global catastrophe (“some say this is the end of times”) and suggested that the US band “changed the world”.

Their decision to quit makes sense, given the state of Mustaine's health. Having conquered throat cancer and radial neuropathy, he's now suffering from arthritis and something called Dupuytren's contracture – a thickening of tissue under the skin that causes the fingers to bend, commonly known as the suitably metal-sounding Viking disease – both of which impede his ability to play guitar. The call to end the band was made during the recording of their self-titled 17th studio album. But then three months later Mustaine announced that the farewell dates announced were only the beginning. The tour is scheduled to last “easily … three to five years”. So there seems every chance that Megadeth will still be bidding the world adieu in the next decade.

Still, there is a definite sense of finality to this new music. Rather than a full-blooded return to the genre their early albums helped birth, it effectively offers listeners a career-summarising redux. Some tracks certainly underline their position as thrash metal progenitors, most notably the flatly superb opener Tipping Point, as well as Made to Kill and Let There Be Shred. The latter would be completely preposterous were it not musically potent enough to make up for the lyrics “on the day I was born, a guitar in my hand, the earth started rumbling a thunderous command … let there be shred!” (There are also images of fingers combusting, guitars squealing in delight as they're beaten to death, pretenders being destroyed, etc.)

On I Don't Care, you get the punkish leanings that led Megadeth to cover Anarchy in the UK in 1988. More surprisingly, there are tracks rooted in the more melodic style the band controversially pursued in the mid-to-late 90s. If there's a certain screw-you bullishness about this – 1997's Cryptic Writings and 1999's Risk seldom rank high among Megadeth fans' favourite albums – there's also a sense of Mustaine underlining that he's actually pretty good at turning his attentions towards the radio-friendly, regardless of what he's really known for: Puppet Parade in particular is really well written.

All of this is performed with the kind of technical precision for which Megadeth have long been famed: whatever one makes of the band's constant lineup changes – the headcount of former members stands at 28 – contemporary guitarist Teemu Mäntysaari fits the band's approach perfectly. But there are problems. The second half of the album noticeably lags, as if its career-summarising approach stretches to reminding listeners of the declining inspiration that's haunted Megadeth's fair-to-middling recent releases: Obey the Call is musically boring and laden with lyrics about ghostly puppetmasters controlling the world's evils, reflecting Mustaine's increasingly cranky and conspiracy-driven worldview, appearances on Infowars and all. He ends with The Final Note, which can't work out whether it's intent on tugging at longstanding fans' heartstrings – “the final curtain falls, a quiet end to it all, now it's just memories” – or heading off into retirement with middle finger aloft: “My last will, my final testament … my sneer.”

But it isn't his final sneer. That comes with a bonus track in which Megadeth take on Ride the Lightning, one of a handful of Metallica songs that Mustaine contributed to before being unceremoniously ejected from the band in 1983. It seems a weird way to conclude things: why end an album intended to celebrate your band's legacy by dredging up the spectre of your sacking from another band? It's certainly not as if Megadeth's version radically reinvents the song in “this is how it's done” style, beyond sounding more polished and growling. Is it a matter of underlining his claimed ownership over some of Metallica's early material? Or simply for the purpose of grabbing extra attention for Megadeth's final album? But then, Dave Mustaine has rarely needed much prompting to pick at the subject of being ousted from Metallica over the intervening 40-plus years. If nothing else, bringing it up one last time is very on brand, as is the rest of Megadeth, good and bad.

Astronomers found evidence that dark matter and neutrinos may interact, hinting at a ""fundamental breakthrough"" that challenges our understanding of how the universe evolved.

Two of the universe's most mysterious particles may be colliding invisibly throughout the cosmos — a discovery that could solve one of the biggest lingering problems in our standard model of cosmology.

Those two elusive components — dark matter and neutrinos (or ""ghost particles"") — are ubiquitous throughout the cosmos, yet they remain poorly understood. In a study published Jan. 2 in the journal Nature Astronomy, an international team of researchers found evidence that dark matter and neutrinos may collide, transferring momentum between them in the process.

This surprising interaction may help to explain why the universe is less populated by dense regions, like galaxies, than predicted — in other words, the universe is less ""clumpy"" than cosmologists think it should be, the researchers said in a statement.

Dark matter is the mysterious, invisible substance that constitutes 85% of the matter in the universe. As its name suggests, dark matter does not emit light, so its existence has been only indirectly inferred from its gravitational influence, as observed in cosmological surveys.

Neutrinos are subatomic particles with infinitesimally low masses and no electric charge, so they very rarely interact with other particles. They're produced by various nuclear processes, including stellar fusion and supernovas, in prodigious quantities: Every second, approximately 100 billion neutrinos pass through each square centimeter of your body, Live Science previously reported. 

Yet dark matter and neutrinos should not interact, according to the leading model of cosmology, known as the lambda cold dark matter model (lambda-CDM). This standard model aims to theoretically explain the large-scale structure of the cosmos.

However, this recent study provides new evidence that dark matter and neutrinos may interact after all, as other researchers have posited over the past two decades.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

If dark matter and neutrinos do collide, and transfer momentum to one another in the process, this discovery would inspire a rethink of the lambda-CDM model. Such collisions could also help to explain the ""S8 tension,"" a mismatch between the expected and actual ""clumpiness"" of the universe.

""This tension does not mean the standard cosmological model is wrong, but it may suggest that it is incomplete,"" Eleonora Di Valentino, study co-author and a senior research fellow at the University of Sheffield in the U.K., explained in the statement. ""Our study shows that interactions between dark matter and neutrinos could help explain this difference, offering new insight into how structure formed in the Universe.""

The mismatch stems from researchers' findings that the current cosmos isn't as packed together as predicted, based on observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) — the first light in the universe, emitted when the cosmos was only 380,000 years old.

""The statement that cosmic structures are 'less clumped' is best understood in a statistical sense, rather than as a change in the appearance of individual galaxies or clusters. It refers to a reduced efficiency in the growth of cosmic structures over time,"" study co-author William Giarè, a cosmologist at the University of Hawaii, told Live Science via email.

 




The researchers tried to unite evidence from energy and density fluctuations in the CMB and from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) — pressure waves ""frozen"" in time from the beginning of the cosmos — with more recent observations of the universe's large-scale structure.

The early-universe data come from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope in Chile and the European Space Agency's space-based Planck telescope, which was designed to study the CMB. The later-universe data come from the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a two-decade effort to create a 3D map of millions of galaxies across more than 11 billion light-years.

The researchers also incorporated cosmic shear data from the Dark Energy Survey. Cosmic shear is the distortion of distant celestial objects due to weak gravitational lensing, which occurs when massive foreground structures bend the fabric of space-time and alter the paths of light traveling from those distant celestial objects to our detectors.

Finally, the researchers combined these data and modeled the evolution of the universe. When accounting for collisions between dark matter and neutrinos and the resulting momentum exchange, the simulations generated a model universe that better agrees with real observations.

—Heaviest antimatter particle ever discovered could hold secrets to our universe's origins

—Astronomers propose making a neutrino detector out of the Pacific Ocean

—Evidence for Stephen Hawking's unproven black hole theory may have just been found — at the bottom of the sea

There's reason to remain cautious, however, as the interaction between dark matter and neutrinos has only a 3-sigma level of certainty — meaning there is a 0.3% chance that this result is a fluke. Though short of the scientific gold standard of 5 sigma, it is significant enough to warrant additional research because, if confirmed, the interaction would prove a ""fundamental breakthrough in cosmology and particle physics"" — and a potential solution to the cosmic clumpiness quandary.

""The final verdict will come from upcoming large sky surveys, such as those from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and more precise theoretical work,"" research team leader Sebastian Trojanowski, a theoretical physicist at the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Poland, explained in a separate statement. ""These will allow us to determine whether we are witnessing a new discovery in the dark sector or whether our cosmological models require further adjustment. However, each of these scenarios brings us closer to solving the mystery of dark matter.""

Last year, Sam Altman posited that the world hadn't yet had its ""humanoid robots moment"" — but, he said, ""it's coming."" In the background, his AI company has been gearing up to make that happen.

OpenAI quietly built up a humanoid robotics lab over the past year, insiders with knowledge of the program told Business Insider. The lab operates out of the same building as the company's finance team in San Francisco, and employs around 100 data collectors. They're teaching a robotic arm how to perform household tasks as a part of a larger effort to build a humanoid robot.

OpenAI explored robotics during its early years and built a robotic hand capable of solving a Rubik's Cube. The company closed the project in 2020; a company spokesperson said at the time that it had chosen to ""refocus the team on other projects.""

The inner workings of the new robotics lab haven't been previously reported.

One person with knowledge of OpenAI's strategy said the company is working on several new hardware projects, including robotics, that are in the early phases of development, and so far, none are core to the company's mission.

Last week, OpenAI put out a request for proposals from companies that manufacture in the US that could act as partners for the company's push into consumer devices, robotics, and cloud data centers. The company did not specify how much it intends to spend or provide a timeframe for the work.

A representative for OpenAI declined to comment.

The lab has more than quadrupled in size since it launched in February 2025, insiders said.

In December, the company told employees it plans to open a second lab in Richmond, California. A December job posting for a ""robotics operator"" with the company's contracting agency lists Richmond as the location.

The lab has a humanoid robot that multiple people described as ""iRobot-like"" on display, but the bot is mostly collecting dust, and few have seen it in operation. The vast majority of the work in the lab is focused on teleoperating robotic arms.

OpenAI has data collectors using 3-D printed controllers, called GELLOs, to operate two Franka robots. These metal arms have pincers at the end and perform household tasks like putting bread in a toaster or folding laundry.

When the data collection program began in February, work focused on teaching the Franka robot how to put a rubber duck in a cup. Since then, it has shifted to increasingly more sophisticated tasks.

OpenAI's lab offers a rare glimpse into how one of the world's most influential AI companies is approaching robotics.

Competitors like Tesla put on flashy demos and often train with full humanoid robots controlled by motion capture suits and virtual reality headsets. OpenAI is taking a quieter path, scaling contractor-driven data collection to train robotic arms on basic tasks.

Both approaches show how far leading AI companies remain from building functional household robots, and how much of that work still relies on human labor.

Wired reported last fall that OpenAI had begun hiring robotics engineers. The company has at least a dozen engineers on the project, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles.

In December, a project supervisor said that the lab needed to increase productivity and efficiency to get more hours of functional data, people with knowledge of the program said. Over the past few months, the lab has nearly doubled expectations for data collection, they said.

OpenAI has previously invested in other robotics companies, including Figure, 1X, and Physical Intelligence. Its 2024 partnership with Figure was designed to build ""next generation AI models for humanoid"" robots, but Figure CEO Brett Adcock said in February 2025 that the company was exiting the deal.

When the first robotics project ended in 2020, it was widely believed that the company was focusing more intensely on ChatGPT. Now, OpenAI has indicated it plans to expand into devices, and it could use its ChatGPT knowledge base to teach a robot how to interpret and interact with the world.

The earlier program focused on reinforcement learning — a trial-and-error approach in which robots learn through a reward system. Now, the company is collecting large amounts of data to train the robots.

""Everyone is fighting for a way to develop large data sets,"" Jonathan Aitken, a robotics expert with the University of Sheffield, told Business Insider. ""We know we have AI algorithms that are capable of being trained to do stuff using big data sets. The issue has always been getting that data set.""

OpenAI's data collection strategy differs from the robotics efforts at companies like Tesla or Figure, where workers record full-body movement and use motion capture suits and virtual reality headsets to operate full-sized humanoid robots.

OpenAI's data collection efforts mirror a study published in 2023 by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, that describes a low-cost and scalable system for collecting robotics data using teleoperated arms. One of the researchers joined OpenAI in August 2024 and works on ""Building the Robot Brain,"" according to LinkedIn.

Alan Fern, an AI and robotics expert at Oregon State University, told Business Insider it's a standard setup that allows the robot to learn by mimicking its operator. Aitken said OpenAI's GELLO strategy could present an advantage over AI companies that use motion capture suits. It's cheaper, he said, and because each controller maps directly to a robot arm, the robot can more easily learn how specific human movements translate into its own motions.

In San Francisco, OpenAI runs three shifts and a few dozen workstations that collect data around the clock, people with knowledge of the lab said. Cameras record both the operator and the robot performing tasks, and workers are rated on how many ""good hours"" of functional training data they can generate.

The reliance on contract workers and performance metrics mirrors how AI companies, including OpenAI, have historically scaled data labeling for their large language models.

""A lot of companies are hoping if you collect enough of this data, you can translate it into robot motions, and they will get a scaling effect and have this ChatGPT moment,"" Fern said.

""That's something that hasn't been proven out yet,"" he added.

The company is setting up new robot stations with robotic arms that more closely mimic how a human moves, insiders said.

OpenAI also uses some of the data to train robots in computer simulations and regularly tests the robot arms to see how well they perform, the people said.

It's unclear how quickly OpenAI plans to translate this data into a full humanoid robot, or how its low-cost, arm-based approach will fare against companies investing heavily in full humanoid systems.

""It does seem to be very early in the process,"" Aitken said. ""From a technical standpoint, it's a really beautiful and configurable interface to lots of different types of robots.""

If Wednesday was Trump day at the World Economic Forum, then Thursday was all about Elon Musk.

Musk, the world's richest person, made his first-ever appearance at Davos, taking the stage in conversation with Larry Fink, the WEF's cochair.

We're bringing you live updates from Musk and the rest of Davos here. Follow along for the latest.

On Thursday, we got to see Elon Musk grace the stage of the World Economic Forum for the first time. He didn't make much of a splash.

Earlier in the day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he was ""living rent-free in Trump's head,"" and Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco got turned away from a cloakroom for not having sufficiently high WEF status.

On the geopolitical front, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked businesses to open offices in his country and got two standing ovations, while Trump formally launched his Board of Peace.

Business Insider won't be liveblogging on Friday as Davos wraps up around midday local time. 

So that's it.

Goodbye, and thanks for reading!

Elon Musk once called Davos ""boring af."" After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him. 

The billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details.

Speaking of Trump's journey home, Air Force One took off from Zurich Airport at 5:37 p.m. local time (11:37 a.m. ET). 

Trump's convoy was seen earlier driving away from Davos before Elon Musk's speech. 

Speaking of Trump's journey home, Air Force One took off from Zurich Airport at 5:37 p.m. local time (11:37 a.m. ET). 

Trump's convoy was seen earlier driving away from Davos before Elon Musk's speech. 

From touchdown to take off, the president spent about 29 hours in Switzerland.

With Musk's appearance over and Trump on his way back home, we're coming into the final stretch of the 2026 World Economic Forum. Private events and cocktail parties will continue long into Thursday night, but there are only a handful of talks and discussions left today, and just a few more scheduled on Friday morning. 

Things will officially wrap up with closing remarks from the WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning at midday tomorrow.

In his 30 minutes onstage, there wasn't a whole lot from Musk that we haven't heard before. He talked about his vision for a robot-powered future, plans to go to Mars, and the rollout of Tesla's robotaxis. 

Whether he has any further engagements at Davos is currently unclear.

""I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,"" he says.

""For quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than being a pessimist and right,"" he says to laughter.

""For quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than being a pessimist and right,"" he says to laughter.

And with that, Musk's first time at Davos comes to an end.

""People ask me do I want to die on Mars, and I'm like 'yes, but not on impact.'""

""The rate at which AI is progressing, I think we might have AI that is smarter than any human by the end of this year, and I would say no later than the end of next year.""

""Tesla has rolled out a robotaxi service in a few cities, and it will be very widespread by the end of this year within the US,"" he says.

Musk says Tesla hopes to get approval for its robotaxis in Europe next month. He doesn't specify where.

""Humanoid robotics will advance very quickly. We do have some of the Tesla Optimus robots doing simple tasks in the factory,"" Musk says.

""By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, but still deployed in an industrial environment,"" he adds.

""By the end of next year, I think we'll be selling humanoid robots to the public. That's when we are confident that it's very high liability, very high safety, and the range of functionality is high.""

Musk said in 2024 that he wanted to sell Optimus in 2026.

""I do think it is a very solvable problem,"" he says.

""When we figure out what causes ageing, I think we'll find it's incredibly obvious.""

""I do think it is a very solvable problem,"" he says.

""When we figure out what causes ageing, I think we'll find it's incredibly obvious.""

Stopping aging isn't necessarily a good thing, he adds.

""There is a reason we don't have a longer life span. There is some risk of an ossification of society, of things getting locked in place.""

""Who wouldn't want a robot to, assuming it's very safe, watch over your kids, take care of your pets?""

""If we have ubiquitous AI, which is essentially free or close to it, and ubiquitous robotics, then you will have an explosion in the global economy that is truly beyond all precedent.""

""I heard about the formation of the peace summit. And I was like, is that piece? A little piece of Greenland. A little piece of Venezuela,"" Musk says after Fink mentions Greenland.

Not many laughs for that one.

""That was not a large applause. Start again,"" Fink tells the audience.

Yesterday, President Donald Trump was on the agenda for 45 minutes, and ended up speaking for nearly 90 including his brief Q&A with WEF President Børge Brende.

Lots of smiles and small talk. Like a bunch of kids happily discussing their summer plans on the last day of school.

And why shouldn't they? After all, for many, the crisis had already been averted over the past 24 hours. A Greenland deal was cut, and many were feeling optimistic about the future.

Speaking @wef in 20 mins. What should I say? 🤭

Humanoid robots can do kung-fu and parkour. But can they make your morning coffee?

At a Davos panel on Thursday, moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, three robotics experts said humanoid robots needed to move beyond flashy demos and perform useful tasks in the real world at scale.

Jake Loosararian, the CEO of infrastructure startup Gecko Robotics, said that deploying robots into real-world environments was the major challenge facing the much-hyped industry.

As he left the stage after his speech, he got a second standing ovation from the Davos crowd.

""Today we met with President Trump. Our teams are working every single day. It's not simple. The documents ending this war are nearly there and that really matters.""

Hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin has a blunt message for anyone expecting artificial intelligence to instantly rewrite the global economy: the hype is real — and it's there to justify enormous spending.

Speaking in Davos yesterday the Citadel CEO said the AI boom is being fueled as much by narrative as by real productivity gains. Griffin, the world's 39th richest person, said that doesn't mean AI isn't powerful — but expectations have run far ahead of reality.

A previous speech, given by Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, overran significantly.

Zelenskyy met with President Donald Trump prior to his speech.

Photos show the presidential motorcade heading down the mountain and out of Davos just before 3 p.m. local time.

Flight-tracking data shows Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 has reached Zurich. It landed at 2:22 p.m. local time, some 10 hours after departing San Jose.

Zurich is 75 miles from Davos, where Musk is scheduled to speak at the World Economic Forum at 4:30 p.m. (11:30 a.m. ET).

Zelenskyy is due to speak in roughly 20 minutes.

Despite being probably the most prominent figure in the world of business over the past decade, today's appearance will be Musk's first in Davos.

He has a difficult history with the conference, having frequently criticized it in the past, famously calling it ""boring af"" ahead of the 2023 edition. That incident sparked the WEF into publicly saying it had not invited Musk since 2015.

Elon Musk's private jet is back in tracking range, flying over France and about 200 miles from Zurich.

For much of the past week, Musk has been locked in a war of words with Michael O'Leary, CEO of Europe's biggest airline Ryanair, over Starlink.

For much of the past week, Musk has been locked in a war of words with Michael O'Leary, CEO of Europe's biggest airline Ryanair, over Starlink.

Perhaps ironically, Musk's jet earlier crossed paths with a Ryanair flight from Madrid to Dublin, which passed behind it by about 70 miles, with their flight paths intersecting roughly 10 minutes apart.

During their spat, Musk and O'Leary called each other idiots and Musk polled X users on purchasing the airline and installing a new boss named Ryan.

Then, on Wednesday, the Irish airline used the beef to promote its January sale and said it would hand-deliver a ticket to X's Dublin offices. Musk is yet to reply.

After the massive buzz around Trump's speech yesterday, things are a little lighter in terms of big name speakers at the World Economic Forum on Thursday. Still, it's Davos, so even a light day would be the envy of pretty much any other conference on earth.

The day's main event, of course, is Elon Musk's appearance at 4:30 p.m. local time (10:30 a.m. ET), but other highlights include a special address from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at 2:30 local time (8:30 ET). Zelenskyy, who initially planned to skip Davos this year, will also meet Trump while he is in Switzerland.

Continuing our coverage of coat rooms across Davos, I was turned away from Cloakroom A in the Congress Center today.

""We're only taking white badges today. Sorry.""

""We're only taking white badges today. Sorry.""

White badges are the top dogs in Davos' weird caste system, having access to basically everything. That's followed by silver (government officials), orange (media-types like me), black (security), and finally hotel badges.

There was a free coat room for us non-white-badgers just around the corner. But that didn't stop some from feeling offended.

I heard one attendee who was turned down muttering ""discrimination"" under his breath.

After leaving the Congress Hall, Trump thanked onlookers, but didn't take questions from reporters.

It looks like Elon Musk is heading to Davos on his Gulfstream G650 private jet — the model of choice among the very wealthy. When I was tracking private jet arrivals on Monday, it was the most frequent type, representing 31 of 157 landings at nearby airports.

According to JetSpy data, G650s that have landed near Davos this week include ones owned by: Aramco, Bill Gates, BlackRock (twice), Blackstone, The Carlyle Group, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Google, and ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

None of Europe's three largest economies, Germany, the UK, and France, will be signatories to the board today.

In an interview with the BBC from Davos this morning, British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said that this was in part due to ""concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace when we still haven't seen any signs from Putin there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine.""

Though Trump's centerpiece appearance at Davos was his 70-minute-long speech yesterday afternoon, the president is back onstage this morning.

He's launching his Board of Peace, alongside other world leaders, including Argentine President Javier Milei and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Elon Musk's private jet is somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean as he makes a last-minute trip to Davos.

The Gulfstream G650 took off from San Jose International at 7:12 p.m. PT. About six hours later, ADS-B Exchange data had it some 2,200 miles away from Zurich.

The Gulfstream G650 took off from San Jose International at 7:12 p.m. PT. About six hours later, ADS-B Exchange data had it some 2,200 miles away from Zurich.

The airplane was last recorded traveling at 660 miles per hour, which means it should land in Switzerland before 2 p.m. (8 a.m. ET). Davos is then about a 40-minute helicopter ride away.

We don't know for sure Musk is on the jet, but it seems highly likely.

Unlike President Donald Trump, who was delayed yesterday due to a fault with Air Force One, Musk should have plenty of time to get to Davos on time.

There has been no shortage of protests at the World Economic Forum this week, with anti-billionaire, environmental, and anti-war demonstrators seen in the town.

One of the more creative demos we've seen, however, is this snow-based slogan. If you can't quite read it, it says: ""NO IMPERIALISM.""

David Sacks spoke on Wednesday at the USA House alongside Michael Kratsios, the White House's director for science and tech policy. He pushed back on the most alarmist interpretations of Elon Musk's warnings about AI and jobs, arguing they strip out a crucial part of Musk's broader vision.

According to Sacks, Musk isn't predicting a sudden mass-unemployment crisis so much as a radically different economic system, closer to a ""Star Trek""-style world where technology supplies basic needs.

I've usually thought of Davos as being more dominated by finance and blue-chip companies, but clearly, tech has taken over.

Walking down the main thoroughfare in Davos is always fun because all the shops that are open the rest of the year are taken over this week by companies that host ""houses"" to showcase their brands and host clients and events.

Walking along the street this year, it seems like 80% of the houses are tech. Palantir and Meta (with its free hot chocolate stand) had the most visible presence. Amazon's house was surprisingly small. Google was far away from the main action. Lightspeed was the only venture capital firm I saw, with its odd retro ""Lighthouse.""

It is also interesting to see who is not here. OpenAI has no house, and Sam Altman did not come, though some executives are here. Elon Musk was not originally part of the program but was a last-minute addition today.

There were so many techies here that sometimes I felt like I was in San Francisco.

I asked a couple of startup founders why they came so far to be here, and the consensus was that there's nothing like Davos for the efficiency of meeting potential customers and investors who are all packed into a tiny Swiss village for the week.

Waiting in the cold in a long line for a party for General Catalyst and Lightspeed, I asked one founder why he traveled here.

He told me Alexandr Wang, founder and former CEO of Scale AI, who is now Chief AI Officer at Meta, advised him that Davos was highly useful because Wang said last year he signed almost a third of Scale's customers in the short time he was there.

Harvey cofounder CEO Winston Weinberg told me that dealmaking started even before I arrived, with many transactions happening in the business-class sections of flights to Zurich from San Francisco and New York.

He called the philosophy ""foundational"" to Cisco. People need to think about how they want to change the world and what they can do to contribute to that change, rather than focusing on specific job titles.

""If in the pursuit of that change, you have to go out and reluctantly manage some people, then go ahead and do that,"" Patel said. ""But management, in and of itself, is not a full-time job.""

When I spoke to them on Wednesday morning, before Trump's speech, they told me clients aren't necessarily looking to pull the plug on things, but the questions are mounting.

""I think it's just raising the spectre of uncertainty, so clients aren't making any definitive assumptions at this stage,"" Hillery told me. ""In the back of their heads, they are starting to think that this could get a lot more complicated than it's been for the last few years.""

And even since the trip, the situation is evolving almost minute by minute.

""There is a bit more of a question mark now compared to the first two weeks of January,"" Wiltz added.

No shortage of jabs at Trump, too. The governor called Trump an ""invasive species,"" among other things.

US president alleges JPMorgan stopped offering him banking services in wake of January 6 Capitol riot

Donald Trump has sued JPMorgan Chase and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, for at least $5bn after accusing America's largest bank of “debanking” him.

The US president alleged that JPMorgan stopped offering him banking services in the wake of the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. Earlier this month, he claimed it had “incorrectly and inappropriately” discriminated against him.

On Thursday, Fox Business and Bloomberg reported that Trump's legal team had filed a complaint in Miami. JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit was filed by Alejandro Brito, Trump's Miami-based personal lawyer, who also has been involved in Trump's legal action against media companies such as ABC News and the BBC for defamation.

In Thursday's lawsuit, Trump's lawyers alleged that JPMorgan had put Trump, the Trump Organization and its affiliated entities, along with members of Trump's family, on a blacklist.

JPMorgan “did not provide plaintiffs with any recourse, remedy or alternative – its decision was final and unequivocal”, the lawsuit claims, claiming that Trump and the other plaintiffs are “confident that JPMC's unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations, and JPMC's unsubstantiated, ‘woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political reviews”.

Last weekend, Trump announced on social media that he would file a lawsuit against JPMorgan, accusing the bank of removing his accounts after the January 6 insurrection. Trump has said several banks, including JPMorgan and Bank of America, rejected his deposits after the riot, though both banks have denied the allegations.

The post seemed to be inspired by a Wall Street Journal report that Trump had offered Dimon the role of Federal Reserve chair last year. Trump denied the accusation and said he would be suing the bank.

In response to Saturday's social media post, JPMorgan said in a statement: “We agree that no one's account should ever be closed because of political or religious beliefs.”

“We appreciate that this administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts,” the statement said.

Dimon spoke out in defense of Fed chair Jerome Powell earlier this month, after it emerged that Trump's justice department had initiated a criminal investigation against him.

The JPMorgan CEO said he has “enormous respect for Jay Powell, the man” despite disagreement with some of the Fed's policy choices. “Anything that chips away at [the Fed's independence] is not a good idea,” he said, warning that it risked driving up inflation and interest rates.

In a swift response, Trump said Dimon was wrong and that “it's fine what I'm doing.” “We should have lower rates,” Trump said last week. “Jamie Dimon probably wants higher rates, maybe he makes more money that way.”

At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Dimon was particularly critical of Trump's proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for the first year, calling the idea a potential “economic disaster”. 

He also suggested the US had become less reliable under Trump. “If you said to me, ‘has America become unreliable?' No,” Dimon said at an event. “It's just, you had total reliance, and now it's less reliable.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Geopolitical developments add to a sense of political anxiety that started building early last year.Olezzo/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

It is, to quote a recent Globe and Mail editorial, “a time of unthinkable things.”

Every day it feels like the Trump administration does something new to disrupt the global world order, as we used to know it.

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, the U.S. President insulted Canada on the international stage, saying this country “lives because of the United States.” That affront came shortly after Trump posted a map on social media depicting Canada, Greenland and Venezuela as part of U.S. territory. It also followed Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos a day earlier, in which he called on middle powers to work together to protect sovereignty in a new era of power rivalry.

Carney stands with Greenland, criticizes Trump without naming him in blunt Davos speech 

The roller-coaster of geopolitical developments is adding to a sense of political anxiety that started building early last year.

When U.S. President Donald Trump first made annexation threats against Canada, along with promises of a trade war, The Globe asked readers how they were feeling and received nearly 100 responses from people expressing angst about the future. A survey released in late March, 2025, by Mental Health Research Canada found 42 per cent of Canadians reported increased anxiety levels over the prior month, with many citing tensions with the U.S. as a factor.

Stefanie Peachey, a registered social worker based in Burlington, Ont., says more clients are asking for help to deal with fears over the upheaval south of the border and how it could affect them.

Does cannabis help you sleep? So far, the science is unclear

“Last year the underlying stress and uncertainty was linked to tariffs and how it would affect the cost of living,” says Peachey. “Now they see images on social media of armed ICE agents roaming the streets of American cities, throwing people to the ground and even shooting them. They are increasingly worried about their personal safety, their children's safety, their grandchildren's safety and the country's safety, too.”

In light of mounting tensions, we asked mental health experts for suggestions on how to cope. Whether you're feeling the weight of global events or struggling to stay informed without becoming overwhelmed, here is some of their advice.

Instead of worrying about what you can't change, concentrate on the areas of your life that you can influence, says Peachey. “The fundamental truth is that we cannot control external factors such as other people's actions, or government decisions.” 

We need to consciously shift our attention away from elements beyond our reach and onto matters where our impact is meaningful, she adds. “Once we do that, we not only conserve valuable mental energy but also gain a sense of empowerment.”

The best way to move past despair caused by geopolitical events is to do something, says Amanda Friesen, associate professor and Canada research chair in political psychology at Western University. Get involved in your local community through organizations aimed at helping people or working on problems you care about, she says, adding that collective action is more effective than one person complaining.

“While politics can have a negative impact on a person, ignoring everything isn't particularly advantageous either,” Friesen explains. “My recommendation is to ‘think globally, act locally.' Concentrate on the issue really tearing you up and ask yourself, ‘Is there some organization locally that I could get involved with, donate money to or learn more about?' I guarantee you there is.”

Find a reputable news source or two that you feel you can rely on for well-balanced coverage, says Friesen. And rather than going down rabbit holes or watching endless videos, focus only on key developments.

“There is no such thing as full information on current events and reading hourly updates will do little for your personal knowledge or ability to act,” says Friesen. “Our cognitive and emotional systems are not prepared for the constant inflow of information. The more people tune into these possible threats, the more their mental and emotional health can deteriorate.”

Peachey recommends setting boundaries on news intake. Designate specific times for checking the news, such as 15 minutes in the morning and evening. Before engaging with news or social media, ask yourself, “‘Is this information helpful or harmful to my mental health?'” Peachey says this simple question can help people make more conscious choices about what they consume.

Take a walk in the snow. Spend time with friends and family. Work on a hobby. Peachey says self-care and doing things you enjoy isn't selfish. It is self-preservation and it helps equip you to handle uncertainty and anxious thoughts and to show up fully for yourself and those around you.

“There is good evidence that people who are lifelong learners, feel better and are more productive, too,” says Dr. David Gratzer, attending psychiatrist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. “So learn a new language, sign up for a university course, watch a YouTube video on how to do a home repair or pick up a musical instrument you've always wanted to learn how to play.”

Gratzer says it's also vital to maintain healthy habits that support your overall well-being during stressful times. Following a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, incorporating regular physical movement into your daily routine and limiting alcohol, cannabis and caffeine can help regulate energy levels and mood.

Peachey says even short and simple activities such as taking five- to 10-minute stretch breaks can have a profound impact. “These breaks boost creativity, productivity and mood, breaking the cycle of anxious rumination,” she says. “A 15-minute daily walk may seem modest, but it can enhance blood circulation, elevate energy levels and provide a mental reset, offering clarity and respite from anxious thoughts.”

When anxiety takes over, it's easy to put familiar routines on hold. However, Peachey says maintaining structure in your day “is one of the best ways to create stability amid uncertainty. Continue with the things that regularly fill your time – going to work, exercising, seeing friends and engaging in hobbies.

“The self-accountability of keeping up with your daily activities and responsibilities will help you stay more present and reinforce the reality that life goes on, even in difficult times,” she says.

The memo directly contradicts the Fourth Amendment, years of caselaw, and ICE's own training manuals.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

An internal memo from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) suggests that agents are authorized to enter the homes of immigrants and citizens alike without a judicial warrant — an assertion that violates the Fourth Amendment and several years of caselaw stating otherwise. 

The memo was first made public in a disclosure from whistleblowers within the federal government, with the help of the nonprofit group Whistleblower Aid. According to that organization, the ICE memo, issued in May 2025, authorizes agents “to enter the residence of an alien subject to a final order of deportation, without consent, including by ‘a necessary and reasonable amount of force'” using Form I-205, which is an administrative warrant, not a judicial one. 

Judicial warrants authorize searches, seizures, or arrests, and are issued by judges within the judicial branch of government. Administrative warrants, which are issued by ICE or the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), allow seizures or arrests of individuals under certain circumstances, but do not allow for search or entry of a person's property without their consent. 

ICE secretly told its officers that any time someone has been ordered removed, ICE can break down their door.It has been accepted for generations that the only thing which can authorize agents to break into your home is a warrant signed by a judge. No wonder ICE hid this memo!

The extent to which the memo has been shared throughout the agency is unclear, though there are several examples of ICE or other federal immigration officials entering people's homes without valid judicial warrants, including homes of U.S. citizens. But the report from Whistleblower Aid indicates that the memo has been used to train new ICE officers, despite the fact that other training materials within the agency directly contradict the memo.

The whistleblowers who brought the memo forward, who are remaining anonymous out of fears of retribution, have also stated that several DHS employees have been reprimanded for expressing their concerns over the document. At least one instructor has resigned from their position rather than teach the new directive. 

In addition to violating years of caselaw — including Supreme Court precedent — stating that federal agents cannot enter people's homes without a judicial warrant, the memo also violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states:

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

Importantly, the amendment does not differentiate between rights of citizens and immigrants. 

David Kligerman, senior vice president and special counsel at Whistleblower Aid, derided the Trump administration for issuing a directive so flagrantly unconstitutional.

“It's just shocking. Every chief executive who's had the opportunity to enforce their immigration laws has never wanted to come close to this red line,” Kligerman told The Washington Post. “No one wants to degrade this Fourth Amendment right, not in this way.”

In a statement accompanying an explanation of ICE's memo, Kligerman also noted: “No court has ever found that ICE agents have such legal authority to enter homes without a judicial warrant.”

The ICE directive was widely condemned as illegal, with critics ranging from lawmakers in Congress to legal experts.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) said in a statement. “It is a legally and morally abhorrent policy that exemplifies the kinds of dangerous, disgraceful abuses America is seeing in real time.” (Notably, Blumenthal has not voiced support for abolishing the agency, despite strong support from the American public for doing so.)

“I try to avoid hyperbole when it comes to Trump policies, but this is absolutely frickin' insane,” said Georgetown Law professor Steve Vladeck, adding that the memo represents “massive, systemic Fourth Amendment violations.”

Responding to Vladeck's post on Bluesky, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, explained just how worrisome the memo is to legal experts, saying it is “one of my top 5 scandals for this admin so far,” perhaps even within his “top 3.”

“This is a massive overreach of power by the Trump administration. Due process isn't optional. It's a fundamental right,” the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said.

“This is clearly unlawful conduct. ICE can't change the law just because it doesn't like it,” former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance opined.

            A federal magistrate judge rejected the Justice Department's initial attempt to bring charges against journalist Don Lemon for appearing alongside protesters who breached a Minnesota church over the weekend, a source told CNN.
    


            “The Attorney General is enraged at the magistrate judge's decision,” a person familiar with the matter said. Attorney General Pam Bondi has been on the ground in Minnesota for two days meeting with federal prosecutors from the state.
    


            Lemon, who is a former CNN host who now makes content independently, was with dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters as they rushed into Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Sunday morning, interrupting a church service and leading to tense confrontations, CNN has reported.
    


            Lemon has said that he was present at the demonstration as a journalist and not as a protester. In a video of the episode that he posted on YouTube, Lemon says “I'm just here photographing, I'm not part of the group… I'm a journalist.”
    


            It is highly unusual for the Justice Department to attempt to criminally charge a journalist who is actively working – though it is not without precedent. Such charges are heavily scrutinized, and, if approved by a judge, often face extended legal battles over whether the journalist is protected by the First Amendment before the case makes it to trial.
    


            In Lemon's case, Justice Department officials immediately, and publicly, asserted that he would face charges. They said Lemon did not have a right to be on the church's private property, adding that interrupting the service may have impeded in the churchgoers' constitutional rights to express their religion.
    


            “The magistrate's reported actions confirm the nature of Don's First Amendment protected work this weekend in Minnesota as a reporter. It was no different than what he has done for more than 30 years, reporting and covering newsworthy events on the ground and engaging in constitutionally protected activity as a journalist,” Lemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement Thursday.
    


            Lowell added that Lemon would “fight any charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,” should the DOJ continue to pursue them.
    


            The Department of Justice could always try again to bring charges against Lemon.
    


            Over the past several weeks, Minneapolis has been the epicenter of unrest over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown after the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an ICE officer. Tensions between protesters and federal authorities have continued to escalate, with the administration planning to surge federal agents in the city.
    


            The church protesters claimed in Lemon's video that a pastor at Cities Church in St. Paul, David Easterwood, appeared to be a top ICE official in the Twin Cities. Once they entered the church, the protesters asked a different pastor leading the service to explain Easterwood's connection to the congregation, one of the protesters told CNN.
    


            Videos of the moment shows the pastor who was leading the service repeatedly asking the protesters to leave.
    


            Dozens of protesters can also been seen on video chanting “Justice for Renee Good” and engaging in angry exchanges with members of the congregation.
    


            The Justice Department has arrested at least three people involved in the protests.

            Barron Trump, son of the US president, contacted police in London last year after witnessing an alleged assault on a female friend while he and the woman were on a video call, a British court has been told.
    


            A transcript of Trump's emergency call was shown during the trial of Matvei Rumiantsev, 22, at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London on Wednesday, the PA Media news agency reported.
    


            Rumiantsev is accused of assault, actual bodily harm, two counts of rape, intentional strangulation and perverting the course of justice. He denies all charges. Rumiantsev's legal counsel declined to comment when reached by CNN.
    


            On Wednesday, the woman told the court that Trump's intervention had helped stop Rumiantsev from killing her, according to British media reports.
    


            “He helped save my life. That call was like a sign from God at that moment,” she said, the British newspaper Metro reported.
    


            Rumiantsev's legal counsel told the court that the woman's claims were a “complete fabrication,” suggesting that the defendant had restrained her due to the fact that she was being “angry and violent,” Metro reported.
    


            Trump, now 19, called the police after speaking to the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, on January 18, 2025, the court heard, PA Media reported.
    


            “I'm calling from the US, I just got a call from a girl… she's getting beat up,” Trump said, according to the transcript of his call with police.
    


            “This was happening about eight minutes ago. I just figured out how to, how to call someone. It's really an emergency.”
    


            Police investigating the allegations later asked Trump if he would be willing to provide a witness statement. Trump wrote in an email to police that what he saw was “very brief indeed but indeed prevalent,” the court was told Thursday.
    


            “I didn't expect her to pick up due to the time difference,” Trump wrote in an email sent May 2, 2025.
    


            “The phone was picked up,” he added.
    


            “The individual who answered was a shirtless man with darkish hair. This view lasted maybe one second… then the view flipped to the victim,” said Trump, who added that the woman had told him “that this individual was giving her difficulty for a long time.”
    


            Police replied to Trump's email, jurors were told, but did not receive a response to that or follow-up correspondence sent on July 1.
    


            The trial continues. CNN has contacted the White House for comment.

            The search for a replacement for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has taken yet another turn, with a dark horse contender gaining momentum: BlackRock's Rick Rieder.
    


            While the decision is still fluid, people familiar with the matter told CNN that the finance executive left a positive impression on those in attendance at his sit-down interview with President Donald Trump last week.
    


            For months, the Trump administration has teased a long list of candidates to take over when Powell's term as chair ends in May. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has spearheaded the search for the key economic role, presenting Trump with four final candidates ahead of the expiration of Powell's term: National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett; former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh; Fed Governor Christopher Waller; and Rieder, BlackRock's chief bond investment manager.
    


            On Wednesday, Trump indicated that he has narrowed down the field. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he repeated his preference that Hassett, long seen as the front-runner, remain in his current role.
    


            And in a Wednesday afternoon interview with CNBC, Trump said Rieder was “very impressive.”
    


            “I'd say we're down to three, but we're down to two. And I can probably tell you, we're down to maybe one, in my mind,” he said of his candidate list.
    


            It would not be the first time he has made such a claim, only to reverse course. The indecision highlights the riddle of how to find a Trump loyalist who is palatable for markets and Congress and who can also successfully navigate the stark division at the Fed to deliver Trump's desired lower rates.
    


            The White House isn't commenting on the Fed chair process or specific candidates until the president makes a decision.
    


Trump's pick for Fed chair is already on track to disappoint him



            Rieder's interview, which took place the same day he was spotted at a White House ceremony honoring the Stanley Cup Champion Florida Panthers, marked the final scheduled candidate meeting for Trump, the people said.
    


            Rieder's initial meeting at the Oval Office with Trump included Vice President JD Vance, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and Bessent, the people said. Dan Scavino, the deputy chief of staff who leads the White House personnel office, was also in attendance.
    


            Rieder's candidacy has largely flown under the radar despite high regard on Wall Street and regular appearances on business television to share his views on markets.
    


            Rieder, who met with Bessent in New York for several hours last September and has been a fixture on the Fed shortlist since, is the only candidate of the final four without experience at the Fed or in government service.
    


            That outsider status is viewed as a positive inside the White House: Aside from Trump's unprecedented attacks on Powell, Trump's economic aides regularly press the need for a shakeup in how the central bank functions.
    


            Rieder's television appearances and BlackRock commentary have also drawn positive reviews inside the administration for an executive who, up until now, hasn't been a known commodity in Washington political circles. He has detailed a clear and positive view of the US investment climate under Trump that will accelerate growth going forward.
    


            On monetary policy, Rieder last week said concerns about the labor market are front and center and should mean that the central bank ”﻿will respond with modest reductions in the policy interest rate,” though officials “will probably choose to wait a meeting, or so, to begin cutting rates again.”
    


            The Fed's benchmark lending rate should drop to 3% from its current range of 3.5-3.75%, Rieder said in an interview with CNBC last week. That would imply a few more quarter-point rate cuts than the one reduction the Fed has penciled in for 2026.
    


            Higher rates allow “wealthy, older savers to do well” at the expense of small business owners and lower-income individuals, he said, noting that cutting rates “would be quite helpful to much of the country.” 



The Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates any time soon. Here's why that might be good news



            Trump has disparaged Powell for not lowering rates quickly enough and continues to call on the Fed to aggressively bring down rates, which were raised after the pandemic as inflation surged. In his address at Davos on Wednesday, Trump again reiterated that the United States should have rates that are among the lowest in the world.
    


            Whoever Trump picks for Fed chair will have the difficult task of laying out a convincing economic argument for several more rate cuts before the Fed's 12-person rate-setting committee.
    


            Fed officials in recent speeches have said they're inclined to hold borrowing costs steady for some time to see how the economy responds to the three rate cuts they delivered late last year.
    


            Rieder does not have a traditional central banking background, with experience instead in fixed-income markets and portfolio management. He's worked at hedge fund giant BlackRock since 2009.
    


            Prior to that, Rieder founded and ran R3 Capital Partners, which BlackRock acquired. He also worked at Lehman Brothers for about two decades, leaving around the time of its collapse in 2008.
    


            From 2017 to 2024, he was also a member of the New York Fed's Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets.
    


            Rieder was also vice chair of the US Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a group of senior private-sector individuals who meet with members of the Treasury Department quarterly. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack served as chair of that committee before joining the regional bank.

MOSCOW, January 22. /TASS/. The filing of corruption charges and the arrest of associates of Vladimir Zelensky have become a ""good anti-corruption tradition,"" Kirill Dmitriev, Special Representative of the Russian president and CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), said.

""For the second time now - right before Zelensky meets Trump - one of Zelensky's closest associates gets arrested/indicted on corruption charges. This is becoming a good anti-corruption tradition,"" he wrote on X, commenting on reports that Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies had brought charges against a former deputy head of Zelensky's office.

Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau earlier said it had uncovered a scheme to ""appropriate funds intended for payments under the ‘green' tariff,"" with total ""losses"" amounting to 141.3 million hryvnia, or about $3.2 million. The bureau did not disclose names. Verkhovna Rada member Yaroslav Zheleznyak said on his Telegram channel that the individual involved was Rostislav Shurma, who served as deputy head of Zelensky's office under Andrey Yermak from November 2021 to September 2024.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Private postmortem says unarmed US citizen was struck in arm, breast and head in shooting by immigration officer

A private autopsy has determined that Renee Good, the unarmed US citizen and mother killed by a federal immigration officer in Minneapolis earlier this month, was shot three times, in her forearm, breast and head.

The independent postmortem was commissioned by lawyers in Chicago representing Good's family, and its findings were released late on Wednesday, ABC7 News reported.

The autopsy, described as preliminary, found three clear gunshot wounds on the 37-year-old's body, two of which were not immediately life-threatening. One struck her left forearm, and another entered her body through her right breast, but missed major organs.

A third shot struck her on the left side of her head near her temple then exited on the right side of her head, the New York Times reported. The newspaper said there was also a graze wound “consistent with a firearm injury, but with no penetration”.

The Good family's attorneys, Romanucci and Blandin, declined to release the full report, but said it would continue “to gather evidence” in connection with her death as it pursued what it said was a civil investigation, the Times said.

The findings align with incident reports, including transcripts of 911 calls, into the 7 January shooting, which chronicled two “apparent gunshot wounds” to the right side of Good's chest, and a “possible gunshot wound with protruding tissue on the left side of the patient's head”.

The death of Good, who relatives said was acting as a legal observer of a surge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Minneapolis, has raised tensions in the Minnesota city and sparked a fight between the Trump administration and local officials.

The White House and the Department of Homeland Security have repeatedly insisted that Good was a “domestic terrorist” who aimed her car at the ICE agent. The officer was forced to fire in self-defense, they claimed.

Multiple video clips of the encounter, however, show that Good was steering away from the agent as she tried to drive away, and at least two of the shots were fired from the side of the vehicle. State officials are angry that they have been cut out of an FBI inquiry, and that federal authorities are looking into Good's widow and Democratic leaders in Minnesota, including the governor, Tim Walz, and the Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, and not the officer who killed Good, Jonathan Ross.

Separately, the justice department has said available video evidence “cleared” Ross, and that no criminal investigation was taking place.

“The Department of Justice doesn't just stand up and investigate because some congressman thinks we should, because some governor thinks that we should,” Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, told Fox News on Sunday.

The lack of an investigation led a wave of federal prosecutors to quit in protest. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has amplified its blaming of the victim, and support for an escalation of immigration enforcement activities, which have led to sometimes violent skirmishes with protesters and the arrests of US citizens and children.

On Thursday, the vice-president, JD Vance, is expected in Minneapolis and will speak in defense of Donald Trump's decision to send 3,000 federal law enforcement officers to the area.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Jan. 21 that Russian President Vladimir Putin has accepted an invitation to join Trump's new Board of Peace for Gaza. 

""He was invited. ⁠He's accepted,"" Trump said at the World Economic ‍Forum in Davos, in referring to Putin. 

Despite Trump's assertions, Putin did not publicly confirm the acceptance of the U.S. president's invitation during a meeting of the Russian security council, suggesting instead that Moscow will ""consult with our strategic partners"" as the Russian Foreign Ministry reviews the details.

Dozens of countries across Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and elsewhere have been invited to the new body designed to oversee the Gaza transition as part of Trump's 20-point plan on ending the Israel-Hamas war.

Governments have been divided on the proposal, as critics fear that the Trump-chaired body — requiring a $1 billion payment to secure a permanent seat — could serve as an alternative to the U.N., an organization the U.S. president has often criticised.

Putin on Jan. 21 suggested that Moscow may pay for the $1 billion permanent seat with Russian frozen assets held by the United States.

""Given the special relationship with the Palestinian people, Russia could direct $1 billion from Russian assets frozen under the previous U.S. administration to the Board of Peace,"" Putin said, referring to the approximately $5 billion frozen by the Biden administration at the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Trump has not yet commented on Putin's apparent offer. 

The U.S.-led board aims to take temporary charge of Gaza's administration and reconstruction efforts. U.S. officials have reportedly also discussed expanding the body to include other conflict zones, including Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Jan. 20 that Ukrainian diplomats are reviewing an invitation by Trump for Kyiv to also join the Board of Peace. However, Zelensky stressed it would be ""difficult to imagine"" sitting at the body alongside Russia and Belarus.

""Russia is our enemy, Belarus is their ally,"" Zelensky told journalists.

Despite Trump's plans to meet Zelensky in Davos, the Ukrainian president cancelled plans to attend the forum, choosing to remain in Ukraine amid continued Russian strikes on energy infrastructure.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday after talks with U.S. President Donald Trump in Davos that the terms of security guarantees for Ukraine had been finalized, but that the vital issue of territory in its war with Russia remains unsolved.

In what he said was a positive sign of progress in long-running peace talks to end the four-year conflict, Zelensky said negotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. would hold trilateral meetings for the first time in Abu Dhabi on Friday and Saturday.

He also said a deal was almost ready on economic recovery after the war with Russia, a key element of Kyiv-backed proposals to push back on an earlier U.S. peace plan seen as heavily favouring Moscow.

Zelensky opened his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos with a reference to the U.S. film 'Groundhog Day,' saying Europe and the wider world were trapped in a cycle of repeating the same debates while threats continue to evolve.

Zelensky and Trump – who have met half a dozen times since Trump returned to the White House last year and upended U.S. policy on Ukraine – both said Thursday's talks were positive.

“I think the meeting with President Zelensky was good. It's an ongoing process,” Trump told reporters, saying that U.S. envoys were heading for talks in Moscow on Thursday. Asked what his message was for Putin, Trump replied: “The war has to end.”

Zelensky, who did not indicate he discussed territory with Trump on Thursday, had said earlier this week he would only travel to Davos if he could sign agreements with Trump on U.S. security guarantees and postwar reconstruction funding for Ukraine.

Trump said his meeting with Zelensky in Davos was 'good,' and repeated his call for the war in Ukraine to end.

Zelensky has been saddled with an energy crisis at home from Russian air strikes that have left millions of Ukrainians across swathes of the capital and other regions without power and heating.

Zelensky described Russia's months-long onslaught as an attempt by Putin to freeze Ukrainians to death. Invoking Trump's operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro to face charges before a U.S. court, he wondered aloud why Putin was not yet on trial.

U.S. envoy for Ukraine Steve Witkoff had told an audience at the World Economic Forum earlier on Thursday that good progress was being made in peace talks, after he met with Ukrainian and Russian officials in Davos.

“If both sides want to solve this, we're going to get it solved,” Witkoff said.

Witkoff was due in Moscow later on Thursday with fellow U.S. envoy Jared Kushner – Trump's son-in-law – for talks with Putin on the possible plan to end Europe's deadliest war since World War Two.

After those discussions, negotiators would head directly to Abu Dhabi, Witkoff said on Thursday, “where there will be military-to-military talks and discussion of the prosperity package.”

Russia has been cool on the U.S.-led peace push, demanding that Kyiv give up part of its eastern Donetsk region which Moscow has been unable to conquer despite grinding forward on the battlefield.

Moscow agrees with Trump that Ukraine is holding up peace deal, Kremlin says

Putin said late on Wednesday that they would discuss a settlement on Ukraine and the possibility of using frozen Russian assets for reconstruction of Moscow-occupied land, as well as Trump's proposal for a Board of Peace, tasked with promoting peace around the world.

Critics of the proposal have said it would rival or undermine the United Nations.

The Kremlin said Putin's meeting with Witkoff and Kushner will take place after 7 p.m. Moscow time.

Ukraine's international bonds rallied more than 2 cents on Thursday as the bout of high-level diplomatic meetings lifted hopes in financial markets that progress could be made toward ending the war.

Russian air strikes hit several parts of Ukraine on Thursday. In the southern region of Odesa, a 17-year-old man was killed when a drone struck an apartment building, the regional governor said.

Eleven people were also wounded in the central city of Kryvyi Rih when a ballistic missile slammed into a residential building, officials said.

In the capital Kyiv, nearly 3,000 highrises across the city remained without heating on Thursday after Russia's latest attack earlier this week.

Jens-Frederik Nielsen said sovereignty was a ""red line"" that needed to be respected as he said Greenland was ready to negotiate after Trump backtracked on suggesting force could be used to acquire it. Follow DW.

Follow below for DW's coverage of developments concerning Greenland on Thursday, January 21. You can catch up on the news from Wednesday on the issue here.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed relief over US President Donald Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday not to impose additional tariffs on some European countries because of a transatlantic disagreement over Greenland.

""I am very grateful that President Trump has refrained from his original plans to take over Greenland. And I am also grateful that he has refrained from imposing additional tariffs on February 1,"" Merz said.

The German chancellor was in Brussels for a meeting that had been organized to develop a joint response to the tariffs Trump had threatened.

Merz said member countries ""will have to strengthen the resilience and robustness of the European Union.""

""The European Union, the European part of NATO, must be able to defend itself,"" Merz said, adding that despite progress, ""we are still a long way from achieving everything we need to achieve.""

Denmark has requested that the NATO military alliance be more present in the Arctic, Danish Prime ⁠Minister ‍Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday ahead of an EU summit meeting in Brussels. 

""We ⁠need a permanent presence from NATO in the ‍Arctic region, including around Greenland,"" ​Frederiksen ​told reporters. ""It's clear for everybody that we are a sovereign state ‍and we cannot negotiate about that. But, of ​course, we can discuss with the US how we ⁠can ​strengthen our common cooperation on security in ‌the ‌Arctic region."" 
 

Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen has said he's not privý with the ""details"" of any potential deal on Greenland being discussed by Donald Trump and NATO and European powers in Davos or elsewhere.

He said the Danish autonomous territory wanted a ""peaceful dialogue"" with the United States and that it was ""ready to negotiate a better partnership"" with the US, including on issues like minerals access, but also said that violation of its sovereignty or right to self-determination was a red line. 

""We have some red lines... We have to respect our territorial integrity. We have to respect international law, sovereignty,"" he told a press conference. 

He said he was ""glad"" about Trump's claim on Wednesday that he was not entertaining the use of force to control Greenland and later that a ""deal"" had been struck. 

The US president and others have been coy on the details of this deal, though he said at a Fox News event in Davos ""essentially it's total access. There's no end, there's no time limit."" 

""We will have everything we want. We're getting everything we want at no cost,"" Trump said. 

How this might differ from the existing, longstanding, and wide-reaching US rights to military access and construction in Greenland — a footprint it has drastically downsized of its own volition in recent decades — is entirely unclear. 

Greenland is becoming a geopolitical hot spot: NATO is showing its presence, the US is asserting itself while Denmark organizes aid. Amid the global power struggle, the Inuit fear their identity may be lost.

After his one-on-one meeting with US President Donald Trump in Davos on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spared no criticism of his fellow European leaders in a World Economic Forum speech, chiding them for timidity in the face of fundamental threats to democracy.

Zelenskyy tore into the bloc over what he called its slow and overly cautious approach to confronting the very real threat on its doorstep as war rages into its fourth year on the continent and European leaders appear to be in disarray over how to deal with Trump's approach to alliances and geopolitics.

Among a number of core issues, Zelenskyy blasted the European response to Trump's threats of taking Greenland by force, asking, ""if you send 40 soldiers to Greenland, what message does it send? Those soldiers won't protect anything."" 

After warning that Europe needs a united fighting force and that NATO only exists as such due to the ""belief that the US will act,"" Zelenskyy said, ""when you refuse to help people fighting for democracy, consequences return.""

US President Donald Trump told US media that the details of his bid to gain full access to  Greenland were being worked out and said he was seeking ""total access"" to the Danish territory.

""It's really being negotiated now, ‌the details of it. But essentially, it's total access. ‌It's — there's ⁠no end, there's no time limit,"" Trump told the Fox Business Network from the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.

Trump acknowledged the impact of his quest for Greenland on global markets and said ⁠he did not plan to pay to acquire it.

""I noticed the stock market went up very substantially ‍after we announced it,"" Trump told Fox's ""Mornings with Maria"" program. He did not mention the dramatic market drops when he would not rule out using force to control the Arctic island that is a Danish territory. 

On Wednesday, Trump stepped back from a tariff threat on eight European countries and ruled out the use of force to ⁠seize Greenland.

European leaders will gather for an emergency EU summit to discuss transatlantic ties on Thursday.

The Brussels meeting was scheduled earlier this week when US President Donald Trump careened from one threat to another against allies over his desire to ""possess"" the semiautonomous Danish territory of Greenland. 

Though perhaps slightly less urgent than before Trump appeared to climb down from his maximalist position on the subject Wednesday evening during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the Brussels meeting will see EU leaders grapple with the fundamental nature of the bloc's decadesold partnership with Washington. 

Trump had previously threatened additional 10% tariffs on allies as well as the use of military force to take Greenland if NATO partners refused to acquiesce to his plan to snatch the island territory from NATO ally Denmark.

Though EU leaders were relieved by Trump's U-turn on the Greenland tariff threat, they are less than confident they can count on him to keep his word.

""Nothing ​much changed,"" said an EU diplomat quoted by Reuters news agency. ""We still need to see details of the Greenland deal. We are a bit fed up with all the bullying. And we need to act on a few things: more resiliency, unity, get our things together on internal market, competitiveness. And no more accepting tariff bullying.""

European Council President Antonio Costa, who will chair Thursday's summit, said the US under Trump has threatened EU security, principles and prosperity, noting, ""All these three dimensions are being tested.""

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told reporters in Switzerland that a new framework agreement put forth by the US would require members of the alliance to quickly ramp up Arctic security efforts.

""We will come together in NATO with our senior commanders to work out what is necessary,"" said Rutte. ""I have no doubt ‍we can do this quite fast,"" he added. ""Certainly I would hope for 2026, I ​hope ​even early in 2026.""

Rutte also attempted to allay fears that he himself had voiced over Greenland taking focus off of combatting the Russian invasion of Ukraine on NATO's eastern flank. The Dutch politician said the intensified Arctic defense effort would in no way rob Kyiv of NATO resources.  

Lastly, Rutte also noted that mineral exploitation on Greenland had not discussed during his Wednesday meeting with the US president in Davos. 

Negotiations on the issue would continue between the US, Denmark and Greenland said Rutte.

As sources familiar with talks between US President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte say Denmark and the US are set to renegotiate a 1951 Greenland defense agreement, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen says the issue of Arctic security concerns the whole of NATO.

In a statement released Thursday, Frederiksen voiced approval for discussions on the issue, adding that she remains in close contact with Rutte.

The prime minister said she is interested in continued dialogue on all aspects of Arctic security — including the so-called ""Golden Dome"" missile defense system — as long as this is ""done with respect for our territorial integrity."" 

Frederiksen's statement confirmed that Denmark is willing to negotiate on security, investment and economic issues, but she added, ""we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty"" while noting that only Denmark and Greenland can make decisions on the kingdom and territory. 

US President Trump says a ""framework deal"" for the future of Greenland is in place, and that he's dropping his tariff threats against Europe.

Danish consumers have found a new way to make their displeasure over US designs on Greenland heard. Technically it is an old way — a boycott — supported by new technology — namely cellphone apps. 

Increasingly, Danes have been downloading apps such as UdenUSA (Without USA) — which is currently the most downloaded app at Apple's Denmark App Store — and using them at the supermarket to avoid US-made goods.

UdenUSA's developers say the idea came last year after Trump's reelection and his return to the idea of the US taking semi-autonomous Greenland away from Denmark. 

With Facebook groups dedicated to the issue attracting hundreds of thousands of members, Jonas Pipper and Malthe Hensberg say consumers were having difficulty identifying US-made products so they decided to create an app that would help them do so as well as suggesting European-made alternatives.

Supermarkets themselves have also taken to identifying EU-made products for consumers. The situation is not unlike boycotts of US-made products in other countries, such as Canada, after Trump began harassing allies with high tariffs and/or open threats to their sovereignty.   

Though the Danish boycott will likely be insignificant in terms of dollar amounts — few US products make their way into Denmark's relatively small economy — the boycott gives citizens an opportunity to make their voices heard on the Greenland machinations of their US ally

In his speech at the World Economic Forum, US President Donald Trump again returned to his plans for Greenland, saying Denmark would not be able to secure the island.

DW's Teri Schultz looks in more detail at his speech.

In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Donald Trump announced that a framework deal for the future of Greenland had been reached.

For weeks, he had insisted on acquiring the Danish Arctic island for the US.

NATO on Thursday said that Mark Rutte had given no ground on Greenland's sovereignty during meetings with US President Donald, Trump who has taken to loudly exclaiming that the US ""must have"" the semi-autonomous Danish territory.

""The secretary general did not suggest compromises on Greenland's sovereignty during his meeting with the president in Davos,"" said NATO spokeswoman Allison Hart.

Rutte himself said he had spoken with Trump about how the Arctic could be safeguarded, adding, ""We had a very good discussion on that.""

Rutte went on to say that further talks would be held in order to, ""make sure when it comes to Greenland particularly, that we ensure that the Chinese and the Russians will not gain access to the Greenland economy of military.""

Trump, who has spoken of the need to fully possess Greenland, said after his meeting with Rutte that he believes NATO allies can come to an agreement that satisfies US desires to create what has been billed a ""Golden Dome"" missile-defense system, as well as granting the US access to critical minerals on the island territory while at the same time keeping Moscow and Beijing away.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte answered ""Yes!"" on Thursday when asked in Davos if he believed US President Donald Trump is committed to the cause of Ukrainian independence and sovereignty, adding, ""I have never doubted this.""

With the world currently focusing so much attention on Trump's plans to snatch or buy Greenland — and what this might mean for the future of NATO and the EU — Rutte said there is a danger that the pressing issue of Ukraine's fate at the hands of Russian invaders gets pushed out of the picture as the war nears its fourth anniversary.

""What we need is to keep our eyes on the ball of Ukraine. Let's not drop that ball,"" said the NATO leader. ","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'dw.com'}","world"

NEW YORK (AP) — Beth Brown was assigned to a major project at work when hardship struck. First, her 6-month-old daughter fell ill with COVID-19. A few days later, her mother passed away. 

Brown, director of health and well-being at a company that provides employee mental health programs and absence management services, sent a note to the senior ComPsych director who was her partner on the project, explaining she would have to miss work to care for her daughter and to make funeral arrangements. “The guilt that I felt for knowing I was going to leave her dry on my end,” she recalled. 

Instead of calling to go over remaining tasks, the director reached out to ask whether Brown was OK and to tell her not to worry about the project. “In the grand scheme of things, this is not important,” Brown recalled her colleague saying. “It'll be here when you get back. I'll be there when you're back.” Hearing the kind words, Brown “felt like there was a brick taken off my chest.” 

The importance of treating others with kindness is one of the first lessons most parents and guardians try to teach children. But the skill sometimes falls by the wayside in work settings that encourage competition and where adults face deadlines and pressure. Financial worries and fears of layoffs also can stifle generous impulses. 

Perhaps that's why acts of kindness on the job often are so memorable for those on the receiving end. Molly MacDermot, director of special initiatives at Girls Write Now, a nonprofit mentorship and writing program, feels lucky to have a boss who was kind to her when MacDermot's father died eight years ago and her mother passed away six months ago.

This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.

As technology accelerates the pace of many types of work, “it's really important to feel human, to be allowed to be human, which is getting the grace to just deal with the bumps in life,” MacDermot said.




Kindness can also mean sharing hard truths in a productive way, going out of the way to welcome a new coworker or bending the rules for the sake of love. 

Here are some examples of kindness in action and ideas for spreading goodwill at work. 

Treating others with warmth and consideration may be especially meaningful at a time of heightened political divisions that has many people feeling like they have to choose sides, said Anna Malaika Tubbs, a sociologist and author of “The Three Mothers” and “Erased.” 

“Especially in a workplace, where you can level the playing field and really make sure people know, ‘Hey, you're welcome here and you're seen here,' that can really make a difference at a time when on a national level people feel really divided from each other,” Tubbs added.

One way to encourage empathy at work is to create an environment where people get to know each other, Tubbs said. Organizing staff retreats where family members are welcome, bringing in guest speakers, starting book clubs and scheduling fun offsite activities like going to an escape room are ways to generate shared experiences and facilitate healthy dialogues, she said. 

The goal isn't “to erase political difference or erase being able to disagree with each other” but to promote a cultural shift by encouraging behavior and actions different from the ones that often get rewarded at work, Tubbs said. 

“Let's not show up to meetings thinking that we have to compete and show who's going to be the loudest and who's going to be the most dominant,” she said. “What would look differently if we were collaborating with each other? If we were more focused on community?”

Creating a supportive culture within an organization requires daily attention, said Maya Nussbaum, the founder of Girls Write Now and MacDermot's boss. She starts meetings with “heart warmers,” a time for staff members to share their thoughts on topics as simple as a favorite candle. She also encourages actively listening to different perspectives.

“Productivity is better when people feel that they're valued and they're listened to and they matter,” Nussbaum said. “They're going to work harder and they are going to care, and they're going to channel their passion as opposed to feeling dismissed.”

Compassion can mean sharing hard truths in a tactful way. For example, it's challenging to let people know they aren't meeting performance expectations, but “sometimes kindness is getting out of your comfort zone and telling someone the truth so they can shine,” said Chantel Cohen, founder and CEO of Atlanta-based CWC Coaching and Therapy, a counseling and life coaching practice in Atlanta. 

When providing feedback as a manager, give specific examples to illustrate the behaviors that need improvement, she said. “Kindness isn't a conflict-free workplace. Kindness is a workplace where repair is possible or improvement is possible,” Cohen said.

However, remember to acknowledge successes. Karla Cen recalls a former boss who she says criticized her several times a day. She learned a lot, but felt unrelenting pressure.

A manager at the retirement community in Florida where Cen works now brought her a potted plant on her first day after driving four hours to meet her. Another manager provides encouraging feedback daily.

“Having her pass by and say, ‘You did that really well today,' it just really uplifts the mood of the whole department and makes us ready to come in for the next challenges,” Cen said.

Before scheduling a meeting, consider whether the goals can be accomplished another way. For example, a manager can tell a working group, here's what's on the agenda, take time to think about it and send your ideas in writing, Cohen suggested.

“Sometimes, the gift of time is such a kindness,” she said. “Maybe you can't give your team time off right now, but what you could do a couple times a quarter is just say, ‘Hey we're going to skip tomorrow's meeting and here are the things I want you all to think about. Submit this in writing so that you can have the time for yourselves.'”

Keeping meetings structured and focused also frees up time, Nussbaum said.

Meher Murshed began dating a colleague, Anupa Kurian-Murshed, more than two decades ago when they both worked at Gulf News in Dubai. The couple wanted to marry, but the newspaper prohibited spouses from working in the same department. They feared one of them would have to quit if they wed.

So they appealed to their editor-in-chief, who raised the issue with the managing director. The top managers decided the couple could keep their jobs and get married as long as one of them didn't report to the other.

“It changed our lives. Life could have been very different,” Meher Murshed said.

The Buffalo Bills lost 33-30 in OT to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional round, and have fired their head coach Sean McDermott. Colin Cowherd analyzes the game, and asks if this was the right move by the Bills.


Buffalo Bills wide Brandin Cooks said that he caught what ultimately turned into a controversial interception in the Denver Broncos' overtime victory on Saturday night.

Cooks, 32, had the ball taken away from him by Broncos defensive back Ja'Quan McMillan after he seemingly completed the catch. The referees ruled it an interception, taking the ball away from the Bills.

""At the end of the day, it was a catch. Not just what it looked like, like you said, but what it felt like,"" Cooks said during a recent appearance on NFL Network's ""Good Morning Football.""

""You see examples throughout the league all year, in previous years, and you like, wait a minute, if that was the catch, then there's a no-brainer that this was the catch. But I think when you look back at it, the time that was spent on it to review it wasn't enough.""

Cooks lamented the lack of time that was spent on the review, given the magnitude of the call. If it was ruled a catch, it would have moved the Bills into field goal range with a chance to win the game on a kick. Instead, the interception gave the Broncos the ball back to their offense with a chance to win the game.

""The first thing you think about, well, it's overtime, so we can't challenge it. And so, when the timeout happens, I'm like, okay, there's hope here,"" Cooks said.

""Like, OK, they're about to take a look at this thing, and get it right. And that's what's going through my mind, right? The offense is marching out there for Denver. Like, wait, hold on. You know, that timeout is going to get them some time to be able to, you know, look this through. Clearly, they didn't look it through enough and, you know, here we are.""

What frustrated Cooks further, is that he was certain that he held onto the ball and made what could have been the game-winning catch.

""(My) knee hit, shoulder hit, back hit, whatever the case may be, my hands never left that ball, right? The other thing is the tie goes to offense, but I really feel in my heart of hearts that I caught that ball and ,you know, it doesn't matter now what I think or what I know,"" Cooks said.

After the crushing playoff defeat, the Bills fired head coach Sean McDermott. Bills owner Terry Pegula told reporters on Wednesday that his decision to fire McDermott was based on the results of the team's 33-30 overtime loss to the Broncos on Sunday.

Cooks signed with the Bills in late November to help bolster their wide receiving corps. In five regular season games with the Bills, he caught five passes for 114 yards. In two playoff games, Cooks caught five passes for 78 yards.

The Los Angeles Rams beat the Chicago Bears 20-17 in OT, and will face the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship. Colin Cowherd analyzes the win and how the Rams were able to overcome Caleb Williams' late game heroics. 

Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams players were hyped as they listened to the national anthem ahead of their playoff game over the weekend, according to video from NFL Films.

Jim Cornelison performed his epic rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" at Soldier Field. The video showed that players were singing along with him on the sideline, joining with the entire crowd who helped belt out the patriotic song before kickoff.

Bears defensive lineman Grady Jarrett was among those stunned by Cornelison's vocals.

""Whoa!"" he said multiple times in the clip.

Rams wide receiver Davante Adams was astonished by the giant American flag that was rolled out across the field for the performance.

RAMS PLAYERS REVEAL SECRET INGREDIENT IN PLAYOFF WIN OVER BEARS

It's not the first time that Cornelison left a mark on NFL fans this season. He received a round of applause back in September when he performed the anthem before the Bears took on the Minnesota Vikings. It was the first ""Monday Night Football"" game of the season.

The 61-year-old is a regular at Chicago sporting events. He's been the Bears' national anthem singer since 2010. He has hit the ice for Chicago Blackhawks games since 2008 and has sung ""Back Home Again in Indiana"" before the Indianapolis 500 since 2017.

Cornelison is just as popular outside of sports. He was a part of the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists in Chicago and sang at some of the most popular opera houses around the world.

He's also on the board of the Illinois Patriot Education Fund and the honorary squad commander of the U.S. Air Force Band of Mid-America.

When I shared my investigative findings into the Tim Walz fraud scandal with the House Oversight Committee, I was met with a stunning refusal by congressional Democrats to accept the facts. Members of “The Squad,” such as Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), were not interested in the truth, but rather in Trump-bashing, name-calling, and outlandish claims that exposing fraud was racist and Islamophobic. They wanted viral moments for cable news, while I wanted to protect taxpayers and vulnerable citizens. 

My message to the Oversight Committee was clear: This grandstanding nonsense is exactly what Minnesotans hate about Washington, D.C.

Those partisan and hyperbolic insults are what got us into this mess. For years, Democratic leadership has minimized whistleblower reports and allowed fraud to grow. The Walz administration retaliated against those who spoke up by claiming they were racist or Islamophobic. Why? To protect their political base at the expense of all Minnesotans.

But crime is crime, no matter who is committing it. 

It is true that most of the fraud is in the Somali community, but it is also true that some of our best whistleblowers have been from the Somali community. Democrats refuse to acknowledge the truth, and that has enabled criminals to steal billions and hurt our vulnerable citizens. 

As Chairwoman of the Fraud Prevention Committee in Minnesota, I've been at the tip of the spear in uncovering the massive fraud that occurred under Walz. Our committee has given whistleblowers a place to be heard, exposed the most egregious fraud, and demanded accountability from those in power. 

Here are the results and hard truths from my congressional testimony that struck a nerve with Walz, Keith Ellison, and Democrats in Congress:

First, we are unearthing staggering amounts of fraud.

As far back as 2014, there were credible whistleblower reports of millions in day care fraud. The fraud intensified starting in 2019, as Walz and Minnesota Democrats allowed fraud to explode. There's been more than $300 million stolen in the Feeding Our Future child nutrition program scandal, and prosecutions have revealed that half of those indicted also ran other Medicaid-funded programs.Yet, despite this being publicly reported in 2023, Walz and his agencies have done nothing to stop those defendants from getting additional state money. We have now found fraud in multiple Medicaid programs, including autism centers, sober homes, non-emergency medical transportation, integrated community supports, and housing stabilization. Just last month, our committee uncovered credible allegations of fraud in two new areas: adult day services and assisted living. Federal prosecutors estimate the fraud could be an astronomical $9 billion. 

Second, in the face of mounting reports and literal criminal indictments and convictions, the Walz administration has repeatedly and publicly denied or downplayed the fraud.Walz's commissioner of DHS Jodi Harpstead, who'd been on the job for almost six years, said in January of 2025, “There's a lot of rumors of fraud more than there is actual fraud.” 

This cavalier attitude reflected the view of the entire Walz administration, which has been gaslighting Minnesotans on the scale of the fraud problem for years. In the face of this refusal to act, we knew we had to take accountability and oversight into our own hands. We launched the Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight Committee, opened a portal for whistleblowers, held 15 hearings, and turned over credible allegations of fraud to federal prosecutors. 

The third point I made to Congress was that other states should learn from the failures of the Walz administration to find and stop fraud. The road map to stop fraud starts with culture. Fraud flourishes when leaders ignore it, and criminals see they can get away with it. Next, fraud happens when basic internal controls are not followed. Third, states have to look at the interconnected web of providers with businesses in multiple program areas. 

Finally, it is important to say what is true and to stand up against fake allegations of racism or Islamophobia. 

I was grateful to bring my findings before Congress, and there is still work to be done to further uncover fraud and hold those criminals accountable. But now is the time to get results. Because of our work, federal partners and prosecutors are seeking justice. We will pressure Walz to stop the flow of state money to indicted fraudsters and hold agencies accountable for turning a blind eye to rampant fraud. 

THE HUMAN COST OF THE MINNESOTA FRAUD SCANDAL

Vulnerable citizens are hurt when leaders refuse to acknowledge the truth, enable criminals, and allow fraud to flourish. We will not allow this to continue. Accountability and justice have arrived.

A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily declined to allow the FBI to examine electronics it seized from a Washington Post reporter's home. 

U.S. Magistrate Judge William B. Porter ruled the agency is permitted to keep Hannah Natanson's two phones, two laptops, a recorder, a portable hard drive, and a Garmin watch that it seized from her residence last week. However, the FBI is not allowed to review the items, Porter wrote in a two-page ruling filed in federal district court for the Eastern District of Virginia.

The FBI is not permitted to investigate the electronics until at least early next month, when a hearing is scheduled on the case. The agency obtained them last week by executing a search warrant. It sought to investigate the items as part of an inquiry into a Pentagon contractor accused of illegally retaining classified documents.

But the Washington Post swiftly filed a court motion asking Porter to force the FBI to return the electronics to Natanson. The outlet warned that the seizure “flouts the First Amendment and ignores federal statutory safeguards for journalists.” It was that motion that Porter weighed in on during his ruling Wednesday. The judge ordered the Department of Justice to respond to the Washington Post's filings by Jan. 28. 

The case began after the DOJ accused Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland who has a top-secret security clearance, of retaining classified national defense materials. A DOJ official said the suspect was messaging Natanson when he was arrested earlier this month, according to the Washington Post, which also reported that Natanson said she communicated with Perez-Lugones through Signal and phone. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi has accused Natanson of reporting on classified information she garnered from Perez-Lugones.

“The Department of Justice and FBI executed a search warrant at the home of a Washington Post journalist who was obtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor,” Bondi said in a post to X. “The leaker is currently behind bars. I am proud to work alongside Secretary Hegseth on this effort. The Trump Administration will not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation's national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country.”

Dmitri Mehlhorn has created a fictional world to game out constitutional collapse.

Betting money puts the odds of constitutional collapse in the United States at about one in 25. Anyone can wager three or four cents on Polymarket, Kalshi, or PredictIt that will pay out $1 if Donald Trump wins a third term in the 2028 election—an impossibility, according to the plain text of the Twenty-Second Amendment: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”

Dmitri Mehlhorn, a former Democratic strategist, thinks that the chance of political apocalypse is about 20 times higher—and that Americans need to start preparing now. He recently secured dual citizenship for his family on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts and is obsessively thinking through how people should respond if Trump tries to maintain power with the threat of force. He styles himself a doomsday philosopher of this worst-case scenario.

On a Tuesday last month, this effort brought him to a co-working space in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood to play a war game of sorts with about 15 finance professionals, nonprofit leaders, technology executives, and former Democratic-campaign advisers—and me.

“Let's just use fiction to just imagine things so that we're not all bogged down in prose,” Mehlhorn told the assembled players as the first glasses of wine were poured. The end of the enlightened order, it turns out, is best contemplated with libations and crudités. “Just imagine a world where certain assumptions are true.”

The assumptions were these: It is December 2025, and a term-limited U.S. president is rapidly consolidating control over the military and law enforcement, and pardoning criminal allies. To win, “President Buzz Windrip” and his team must increase their own wealth and maintain power or secure legal amnesty through 2030. They are competing against two other teams: one representing the business community, which seeks to protect and grow its capital and avoid prison, and one representing the defenders of the U.S. constitutional system and the rule of law. The game plays out over several 30-minute rounds, as players submit their actions so that AI agents—the game masters—can calculate the impact of each move and present new challenges. The premise of the game, like a round of Dungeons & Dragons, encourages players to check their personal politics and morality at the door—and to try to think more radically.

“​​You have a man who breaks the law, and that man is the strongman. Which bends, the man or the law? That's the question,” Mehlhorn told me when we first met to discuss his project. “If the president has proven in his first term that he will ignore subpoenas and ignore congressional budget authorizations and pardon anybody who also does, then suddenly, there's no power. What are the remaining checks? Every check is gone.”

Read: Trump's plan to subvert the midterms is already under way

Mehlhorn's ideas exist well outside the Democratic mainstream, which remains focused on the midterms and 2028 election—contests that he believes will have little meaning. He assumes that federal law enforcement will operate at Trump's whims and that Democrat-run states need to build deterrence—threats of federal-tax boycotts, an expansive embrace of states' rights, a new understanding of the importance of gun ownership, to name a few. His defenders see him as a colorful provocateur who is forcing uncomfortable conversations. His critics in Democratic politics consider his obsessions dangerous distractions, built on fanciful thinking, from the difficult work of winning elections and regaining power.

The game—held in a neighborhood better known for $5,000 handbags than fantastical End Times—is a test of Mehlhorn's most outlandish ideas. The three teams prepared to split up and move into separate conference rooms to plot their strategy. “It can be zero or one or two winners,” Mehlhorn announced, “but it cannot be three winners.” He didn't say what soon became clear: The zero-winner scenario means that the nation has collapsed into civil war.

If Mehlhorn is inclined to imagine a president discarding settled norms and restraints, perhaps it's because he's so often done so himself. He experienced Trump's 2016 victory as a century-defining challenge to the American experiment. He responded by transforming himself from a venture capitalist into an iconoclastic Democratic strategist. His ticket was a friendship with Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, whom Mehlhorn told me he knows from their time together at Stanford. As Hoffman's donor-adviser, Mehlhorn helped direct more than $1 billion in anti-Trump spending from 2017 to 2024, particularly by rallying other wealthy liberals who had ties to Silicon Valley.

Their projects were often unconventional and frequently controversial. They backed prescient planning in 2020 for the possibility that Trump would resist the peaceful transfer of power, and two years later, they warned that “MAGA leaders intend to use 2022 midterm wins to install Trump in 2024 regardless of the vote.” They spoke openly of their efforts to dampen voter enthusiasm in Republican communities, the sort of vote suppression that other Democrats have long tried to combat.

Once it became clear that Trump would run for president again in 2024, Mehlhorn said that he and Hoffman helped fund the failed challenge to Trump's candidacy under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits federal officials who have “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” from holding office again. (The Colorado Supreme Court ruled in their favor, only to have the decision overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.) They helped pay the legal bills of E. Jean Carroll, a writer who successfully won a civil judgment against Trump for sexual abuse and defamation. They supported the Republican candidacy of former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley during the 2024 primaries, in an effort to weaken Trump. They were early backers of anti-Trump groups such as the Courier Newsroom and Republican Voters Against Trump, and of efforts aimed at turning out young urban voters through giveaways and parties. Frustrated with Democrats' dependence on television advertising, they funded apolitical Facebook communities that were designed to attract audiences of less likely Democratic voters, who would find themselves bombarded with get-out-the-vote messages.

“The people who had been funding elections through 2016 were extremely conservative and cautious tactically,” Michael Podhorzer, a former strategist for the AFL-CIO who worked with Mehlhorn during the 2020 election cycle, told me. “What he brought from a Silicon Valley perspective was the idea, as he put it, that he would be happy if he funded 10 things and nine failed.”

Mehlhorn was also the rare political operative who did not mind making enemies—or opposing liberal causes, such as voting-rights reform in 2021, which he fought because he thought that it would distract from economic issues important to voters and lacked a path to becoming law. I spoke with one of Mehlhorn's admiring colleagues, who requested anonymity to speak frankly and described him as “an asshole to a bunch of people who never have people tell them hard things.” Other Democratic strategists who know Mehlhorn were less admiring. Several declined to comment, because they did not share his eagerness to fight with allies. Others remain scarred by public and private feuds with him over strategy, experiences that Mehlhorn acknowledges as “bullying my own allies.”

In 2017, Mehlhorn secretly helped fund a deceptive social-media botnet campaign, which mimicked foreign-interference tactics and was designed to hurt a Republican Senate candidate. The backlash was swift. Hoffman later apologized for how his money had been used, saying that he had not been aware of the project. Mehlhorn said that he would no longer fund such efforts.

Then, in the summer of 2024, Mehlhorn crossed an even brighter line, suggesting in an email to a small network of politicos that the assassination attempt against Trump could have been a false-flag attack in the tradition of authoritarian regimes, such as the one run by Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I know I am prone to bias on this, but this is a classic Putin play and given the facts seems more plausible,” Mehlhorn wrote. “Look at the actual shot. Look at the staging. Look at how ready Trump is to rally.” He pressed recipients to investigate whether the shooting might have been staged so that Trump could benefit from the photos and the backlash.

When the conspiratorial email was published by Semafor, it ignited bipartisan outrage. Mehlhorn apologized. Within a week, Hoffman cut ties. Even as many Democrats distanced themselves, Mehlhorn quickly launched his own effort to support Kamala Harris's bid for the presidency. But after Trump won, he announced that he was done with electoral politics. Mehlhorn didn't think that Trump intended to allow free and fair elections again anyway. “This moment demands recalibration, resilience, and resolve,” he wrote to friends weeks after the election. “Even as authoritarian forces ascend, history shows that ingenuity and collaboration can prevail.”

He set about reinventing himself again, this time as a political thinker. He was, he said, no longer fighting the war but working “in the war college.” When we first met for this story, he gave me a list of 30 authors who have shaped his thinking, including the philosophers John Locke, Karl Popper, and Hannah Arendt; the astronomer Carl Sagan; and the retired federal judge J. Michael Luttig. But he felt that the world had already spun beyond the bounds of what traditional white papers could anticipate. So he decided to start working in fiction.

Mehlhorn has written a science-fiction book imagining America's collapse into autocracy, and he programmed an AI to create a set of fictional Substack authors who write about parts of his political vision. Mehlhorn also founded a new group called the Atoll Society, named for the ring of islands that forms after an underwater volcanic eruption. In this metaphor, Mehlhorn casts the United States as we know it as the exploded volcano, a void. The surrounding islands—a national and an international “archipelago of light”—will have to form the new resistance.

In any role-playing game, the rules shape reality. Players are given win conditions that define their motives, and the game masters are given the ability to throw any obstacle in their way. As the cheese plates arrived in SoHo, the three teams found themselves in uncharted territory. (To get the full, immersive experience, I participated in the game as one of five players on the fictional president's team. As a condition of my joining, I agreed not to identify or quote the other participants.)

The AI game masters told the players that an Oregon sheriff had started organizing local law enforcement in support of the Constitution and against the president's consolidation of federal forces. The president's team moved quickly to prosecute the sheriff for treason. The business community bought up national-media properties in the hope of increasing its leverage with the administration. The constitutional defenders began recruiting retired generals to counteract the president's consolidation of power. Both the president's team and the rule-of-law defenders launched back-channel negotiations with the capitalists.

Conditions deteriorated rapidly. The National Guard in blue states began to defect after being federalized by the president, loosening his hold on the military. Wary of the economic instability, the business community tried to relocate money outside the country, prompting the federal government to seize $600 billion. Then the president's team launched a false-flag cyberattack on electricity infrastructure and pinned it on North Korea.

The exercise quickly descended into the realm of dystopian fiction, as the players wrestled with the same ideas that Mehlhorn has been developing. The constitutional defenders, operating through Democratic state leaders, found themselves leaning into the “states' rights” powers of the Tenth Amendment. By the later rounds, the blue states had launched a tax boycott, worked to win over the military, embraced the Oregon sheriff as a champion of liberty, and abandoned the long-standing liberal aversion to guns.

“There are a lot of people with guns and military experience in this country. A lot of them. The Democratic Party does not have relationships with them at all,” Mehlhorn said. “You start to have alliances built around the Bill of Rights and start having a notion that the tax, the golden goose of all this wealth creation, is not just going to keep on paying if the federal Constitution is clearly in breach. That set of conversations can create a set of incentives where you actually deter the far-worse outcomes.”

Listening to Mehlhorn, I found it hard not to wonder how he would react if a similar exercise were conducted by Trump supporters—gaming out how to combat a dastardly Democratic power grab by rallying an armed coalition to stop it. Many in the president's coalition are already warning about a wave of what the White House adviser Stephen Miller calls “domestic terrorism” to obstruct federal authority—a catchall term that Trump aides use sometimes to describe activity protected by the First Amendment, and sometimes to describe the physical obstruction of law-enforcement efforts. Meanwhile, Trump supporters, such as the lawyer Alan Dershowitz and the former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, have been busily preparing their own outlandish scenarios for the president's indefinite rule. In important ways, the political debate has begun to shift away from what is happening to focus on the darkest visions of what might happen next.

Trump started selling Trump 2028 hats three months after taking office last year. Eight months in, he gathered military leadership to focus on the “war from within.” When Democratic lawmakers released a video reaffirming that the military code does not permit carrying out illegal orders, Trump accused them of seditious behavior “punishable by DEATH.”

Trump has been, for many of his most devoted supporters, delightfully ambiguous about whether he will actually try to run again in 2028. Trump said in March that “there are methods” for getting around the Constitution's third-term prohibitions. When asked in August, he said that he would “probably not” seek another term but then added, “I'd like to.” He told reporters in October that the Constitution is “pretty clear” that he's “not allowed to run,” only to have a White House spokesperson say last month that the nation would be “lucky” for such a thing to happen. His chief of staff, Susie Wiles, told Vanity Fair that he would not run again. “But he sure is having fun with it,” she added. “When you think of it, we shouldn't even have an election,” Trump told Reuters about the 2026 midterms last week. (The White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson provided a statement attacking The Atlantic when she was asked about Trump's plans.)

Dershowitz, a Harvard Law professor who has worked for both Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, told The Wall Street Journal last month that he had given Trump a draft of a book he wrote that includes suggestions for working around the Twenty-Second Amendment. In one such scenario, Dershowitz told the Journal, he suggests that Republican electors representing Trump, if he were to win, would decline to cast a vote in the Electoral College, which would pitch the decision to Congress, which would then appoint Trump. “They then select, and not elect, the president,” Dershowitz told the Journal, adding that he does not think Trump will pursue this path.

Mehlhorn believes that the most likely scenario is simpler: Trump would announce his candidacy for president late, leading the Republican Party to easily nominate him. The Supreme Court then would either split on the question of whether this is legal or rule against Trump with no effect. (J. D. Vance has repeatedly endorsed the idea of the president defying Supreme Court rulings.) As the votes are being counted, Mehlhorn imagines, Trump and federal law enforcement would declare rampant fraud in urban centers and move to disqualify residents of those districts' votes. In January 2029, Vance would do what Mike Pence did not do in 2021: use his power to throw the election to Trump. If there is resistance, another a pro-Trump mob—including many who have already been pardoned for the January 6, 2021, attack—could provide backup.

“As president, who stops him?” Mehlhorn asked me as he described the scenario. “Who prevents that from happening? What person? What combination of people?”

Read: Trump Exhaustion Syndrome

Even if you accept the premise that Trump would take such radical steps to achieve a third term, though, there are several answers to this question. The first is that Trump will turn 82 before the 2028 election, making him older than Joe Biden was in 2024. (Mehlhorn agrees that health could be a factor.) The strongest internal check might be the American electorate, which would still have the ability to vote Trump's allies out of office, splintering his coalition and potentially providing the votes for his impeachment and conviction. A recent Economist/YouGov poll found that 68 percent of the country, including 45 percent of Trump voters in 2024, did not want him to serve a third term. Trump's recent pivot to try to reverse his falling approval numbers on the economy are an indication, if nothing else, of how much this year's midterm elections will matter in determining whether he can hold together his coalition.

Then there are other parts of the executive branch, including military leaders, Trump's inner circle in the West Wing, and the national party. Many people now view his consolidation of power as a necessary shift, but their support is based on the belief that these changes are happening within the constitutional framework. If Trump defies the Supreme Court, cancels urban votes en masse, or outwardly defies the Twenty-Second Amendment's plain text, even some of his top advisers might defect. Investigations into the January 6 attack have revealed that many Trump aides, including ones who continue to work for him, were appalled at what happened that day, and some tried to intervene.

Mehlhorn welcomes the debate, in part because he is hoping that he is wrong. And after spending time with him, I realized that he is interested less in the most likely outcome of any situation than in the most dangerous plausible outcome. Bill Kristol, an anti-Trump activist who previously edited the conservative Weekly Standard, estimates that the chance that Trump runs for a third term is about one in four—much lower than Mehlhorn's prediction but higher than the betting markets'. He told me that the scenarios raised by Mehlhorn have value.

“I do think there is just a consistent underestimation of the problem or the challenge of how alarmed we should all be,” Kristol said. “I think someone like Dmitri is useful in leaning against the overconfidence.”

Within an hour of the game's completion, the AI game masters produced a 10-page verdict on the winners and losers, summarizing what had happened and why. In the final round of the game, the business community turned on the president—by a vote of 3 to 2 in their conference room—using their media empire to expose his role in the false-flag attack on U.S. infrastructure. The president eventually fled on a military aircraft to Hungary. The Oregon sheriff was sworn in as the president at the California state capitol instead of in Washington, D.C., a sign of how fragile the nation had become.

As with the first time the game was played, in Washington, there were two winners: the business community and the defenders of the prior constitutional system. The country as a whole, however, did poorly, falling into a recession. “The Republic held. Barely,” the AI game engine concluded. “And only because enough people, across enough fractures, chose to hold it.”

Mehlhorn said he'd programmed conditions that would allow the president's team to win two-thirds of the time. But at both events where he has staged the game so far, the president's team has been the only loser. In his view, this may reflect a design flaw that he can address ahead of future gatherings, including one planned in Midtown Manhattan this month and events scheduled later this year in Paris and Berlin. Business interests in real life would likely not move as a single block. Maybe his assumptions are simply wrong, and American democracy is more robust than he fears.

But Mehlhorn also suggested that the president's team in both game runs may have been too timid—that the elite groups of players he had gathered lacked imaginative cruelty. “Perhaps participants from rule-of-law cultures instinctively hesitated to deploy violence,” he wrote to the players in a follow-up email, “even in simulation.”

The California governor's pivot to the center may be too late for 2028.

Gavin Newsom is currently in the lead for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. Newsom's early advantage is especially impressive for the way that it puts him well ahead of candidates with better name recognition, including Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Every other Democrat who hasn't already run for president is stuck polling in the single digits.

A key source of Newsom's appeal is the belief that he's electable. It's easy to see why the party's voters have such a favorable view of his political skills. The California governor has combined an ideological flexibility—lately embracing both the “abundance agenda” and dialogues with conservatives—with a relentless mockery of President Trump. His new persona as a fighting moderate, a Democrat in tune with the country's shifting desires and ruthless toward the man at the top, deftly speaks to the needs of a party desperate to regain the White House.

But Newsom has a problem: He has been a California politician for decades, and has held the state's governorship since 2019. During his tenure, the state has been a laboratory for some of the Democratic Party's most politically fraught policies and instincts, which has left it less affordable and more culturally radical than it used to be. His record not only raises pressing questions about how effectively he could govern as president; it also provides opponents an endless buffet of vulnerabilities across social and economic issues.

Indeed, many of Newsom's positions read as if they were reverse-engineered from Republican attack ads. California has spent billions of dollars offering Medicaid to undocumented immigrants, and millions more on providing transgender surgeries for prisoners, some of them on death row. But because these policies either command majority support among Democratic voters or matter enormously to progressive interest groups, Newsom could very well make it through a primary despite a record that would repulse swing voters come November 2028. Just about everything people don't like about the Democratic Party has come true in Newsom's California.

Democrats have turned affordability into their most effective cudgel against the Trump administration. Should he run for president, Newsom's record in California would seriously compromise this message.

The state's long-standing aversion to new construction has made housing notoriously expensive. Its median home price is nearly $1 million, and building multifamily housing costs more than twice as much in California as it does in Texas, and 50 percent more than it does in Colorado. This is one reason that California is among only seven states to have lost residents since 2020.

Helen Lewis: The front-runner

The state's high home prices have also driven a surge in homelessness, which has risen by more than 20 percent since Newsom took office. In the absence of shelters and other arrangements, California has allowed public spaces to host homeless encampments. The ubiquity of the state's homelessness has become one of its most distinctive traits—a haunting tableau of its unaffordability and social disorder. If Newsom wins the nomination, Republican attack ads will inevitably roll the tape of children walking home from school past unsheltered people using drugs in public.

Newsom doesn't deserve all of the blame. The most serious barriers to housing predate his tenure, and California's temperate weather makes it easy for homeless people to gather and sleep outside, rather than finding shelter somewhere. He has also lately endorsed policies designed to permit more and cheaper housing, such as a bill he signed in 2021 that ended single-family zoning in the state and legalized building up to four units on every lot. But these changes have yet to move the needle on housing supply in the state. In the first 10 months of 2025, Florida issued permits for three times as many new housing units than California did for every 1,000 residents.

Any welcome, belated moves that Newsom has made to lower costs must also be weighed against other steps he's made to raise them. Newsom has sought to phase out gas-powered cars, banning their sale by 2035 and their use after 2045. This past spring, Congress stepped in to revoke the waivers that allow California to set such rules, a move that was backed by 35 House Democrats, which Trump signed into law in June. Newsom responded with an executive order doubling down on his aggressive emissions standards.

California has the most expensive gas in the continental United States. It has the highest state-excise tax in the country, at 61 cents a gallon; imposes a sales tax of 10 cents a gallon; and charges another 54 cents a gallon to cover the costs of complying with the state's environmental regulations. Newsom opposed a repeal of the gas tax in 2018.

There are sound reasons to tax gasoline. But the politics of it are awful. That the state has made gasoline-powered cars more expensive without providing affordable alternatives hardly helps. A grand scheme to link Los Angeles and San Francisco with a high-speed train has already consumed $14 billion in tax revenues and has gone nowhere. The plan now is to build a line connecting Gilroy (80 miles from San Francisco) and Palmdale (more than 60 miles from L.A.) by 2038, at a cost of $87 billion—though both the price and the timeline should be taken with bulldozers of salt. The costs and challenges of building infrastructure may be a national problem, but California's case is the most embarrassing white elephant.

California's affordability problems are dire, but Newsom's greatest vulnerabilities may be cultural issues. His tenure has seen the state fall hard for faddish progressive policies on immigration, education, and crime that either didn't work, violated the intuitions of most Americans, or both.

In a recent podcast interview with Ezra Klein, Newsom acknowledged some of his political vulnerabilities. He admitted that the state has bungled illegal immigration. (“We failed on the border. We need to own up to that. Largest border crossing in the Western Hemisphere, in my state.”) Unlike Texas and Arizona, which anticipated a surge of migrants in response to the Biden administration's policies, and deployed state troops to fend them off, California greeted arriving migrants with a “safe and welcoming border,” according to 2023 praise from Newsom.

Jonathan Chait: The coming Democratic civil war

Newsom's record on immigration will not be helped by his move to expand Medicaid to cover those who entered the country illegally. On Klein's podcast, Newsom defended this on moral grounds: “I believe in universal health care. Others may say it—I did it.” He did not talk about how the policy may have contributed to the border surge, or acknowledge that allowing people who break the laws to get the same benefits as those who follow them undermines the point of laws.

Newsom also failed to mention just how unpopular the policy is, at least outside of California. When the Democratic polling firm Blue Rose Research asked half a million Americans to rank their support for 190 Republican and Democratic policies, they found that providing free health care to undocumented immigrants placed 187th, making it a touch more popular than abolishing prisons and abolishing the police. Newsom also declined to note that the state, at his direction, is suspending Medicaid enrollment for new undocumented applicants this year due to budget shortfalls.

Under Newsom, California's schools de-emphasized academic rigor and embraced left-wing pedagogy. In 2021, he signed a bill mandating an Ethnic Studies course about power, identity, and social justice for all high-school students. The model curriculum, which in its first draft taught “cisheteropatriarchy” and “hxrstory,” and likened capitalism to white supremacy and racism as a form of power and oppression, sparked concerns and revisions. Newsom quietly defunded the measure in the latest budget just before it was meant to take effect this year. He did not explain why.

During Newsom's tenure, the state has flirted with various misguided education reforms in the spirit of increasing equity. The governor-appointed University of California Board of Regents committed in 2021 to ending the use of test scores in evaluating applications, in a bid to diversify the student body—despite research suggesting that test scores are perhaps the least biased part of a college application, compared with grades and personal essays. Predictably, the UC San Diego campus—one of the system's most exclusive—has seen a 30-fold increase in students requiring remedial math instruction since 2020. About 70 percent of those students do not meet even middle-school math standards. If only there were a way of measuring their math abilities before accepting them into what was once one of America's finest public universities.

Newsom has thrown himself behind progressive stances on affirmative action, crime, and reparations, having recently signed a bill to create an agency that will deliver restitution to the descendants of slaves. These positions put him in lockstep with progressive interest groups but are well to the left of most Democrats, to say nothing of swing voters. In 2022 he signed a law that bars police from arresting anyone for loitering with intent to engage in prostitution, which has left corridors in L.A. teeming with prostitutes. A tough-on-crime ballot measure—opposed by the likes of the ACLU and other progressive groups—passed overwhelmingly in 2024, despite his opposition.

Newsom seems to have recognized that appeasing California's Democrats puts him out of step with the country. He began tacking toward the center as early as 2023, when he vetoed labor-backed measures to give unemployment benefits to striking workers and extend workplace-safety standards to domestic workers such as nannies.

Conor Friedersdorf: Gavin Newsom is not governing

Following Joe Biden's political collapse and Trump's victory, Newsom has more plainly been playing to a wider audience. He recently announced that he was working behind the scenes to stop a union-proposed wealth tax on billionaires. He has expressed his discomfort with policies allowing trans girls and women to compete in women's sports—something that California currently and controversially allows—and he launched a podcast in early 2025, on which he swiftly hosted Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. He signed a measure in September increasing oil drilling in the state and has spent much of the past year crudely trolling the president online, signaling a breakup with the hall-monitor elements of the left.

Newsom has capably sensed what Democrats want right now, and is delivering it with a roguish charisma. The trouble is that before this awkwardly recent pivot, the governor spent years trying to satisfy every Democratic whim in a state where there was little incentive to appeal to anybody who would even consider voting for Trump.

In political terms, 2028 is ages away. Any Democratic nominee could very well face a Republican candidate so discredited by Trump's governing failures that their own vulnerabilities pale by comparison. But Newsom's own missteps are considerable enough that, in a close race, they might well prove decisive.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Derek Fulton, 31, a former Nvidia software engineer who quit to found the North Carolina-based cloud startup Carolina Cloud with his wife. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment about its work culture. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I've been messing around with computers since I got my first MacBook in 2006 at age 11. From building potato cannons to flying drones, I always wanted to solve problems and build things.

After college, I worked in data science at a European bank and as a quantitative analyst at a hedge fund specializing in mortgage investments.

When a friend from college who worked at Nvidia posted on LinkedIn about a software engineering opportunity, I knew I had to apply. I've always been a technologist at heart, and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to see what all the fuss was about.

When I first joined, I felt like I was learning a good bit. It was the first time I was on a team where software was the final product and not just an internal tool — where getting the last mile right really mattered.

But after a few months, I felt like I wasn't learning anymore. There was a top-down management style and a nitpicky, boxed-in way of working. I worked on a lot of bugs and features, and when I asked to work on different projects that I wasn't familiar with, I was told no.

People assume that if you work at Nvidia, you make a lot of money. My package was in the low six figures, and the wide disparities in pay between older and newer employees impacted the culture because we were all playing different games.

The way I view a job is I want to either be learning or earning. I joined late enough that the money wasn't life-changing, and I felt I could get another job that paid roughly the same amount if it ever came to that. Also, our cost of living is reasonable in the Raleigh-Durham area, and my wife and I are both pretty fiscally shrewd.

I always knew I would launch my own company one day. One of my ambitions was to command my own time by the age of 30 and to have kids who could grow up seeing me do that every day.

My wife and I invested about $20,000 to found our family-owned cloud provider, Carolina Cloud. We're bootstrapping for now, but aren't opposed to raising a small round down the line if we fill our current server fleet.

Carolina Cloud does offer GPUs, but we're focused on CPUs because we believe they absolutely aren't going anywhere: they're less finicky, use less power, are cheaper, and last for years.

At previous jobs where we'd rented cloud, the prices were so high compared to what I knew it would cost to actually build one of the computers, so I saw an opportunity to create a provider that delivered value while still making money.

Carolina Cloud is focused on on-demand, high-performance compute. Some of our early customers are hedge funds and genomics companies, particularly in the Research Triangle. We differentiate from hyperscalers with lower pricing, no egress fees, and high-touch support.

Quitting my job at Nvidia has turned out to be a boon for my mental health. After a couple of weeks, I started sleeping better, chatting with strangers in public, spontaneously running errands I'd forgotten about, and calling people I hadn't thought about in years.

I've also been working really hard, but on my own terms, which has allowed me to reconnect with my love for technology.

While it takes time to get a business off the ground, I told myself that if we didn't turn a profit in 18 months, I could go back to a traditional job. But right now, early interest has gone as expected and indicates that we should be able to stay the course.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Fisayo Che, the founder of women's wear brand Elisamama. It's been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified Che's statements, including the amount Saks owes, with documentation she provided.

Saks Global filed in January for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which allows it to continue operating while undergoing a court-supervised reorganization of its debt. In a statement, Saks said it is committed to ""trusted relationships with brand partners,"" and that funding it secured through the bankruptcy will ""facilitate go-forward payments to brand partners.""

Becoming a fashion designer was never a part of my vision board. When I founded Elisamama, I was still working a corporate job.

I felt like I wanted to live a life of more meaning and purpose. My family is from Nigeria, and I spent time there growing up. I got the idea to start a brand that supports women artisans in the country.

Elisamama is a women's wear and children's brand inspired by African artistry and prints. At first, I sold the clothing at flea markets; later, I listed on Etsy and promoted it on social media.

Saks really gave my business a platform to grow. Now, it's going through bankruptcy and hasn't paid me for some of my inventory. I'm not sure how to trust the company going forward.

In the fall of 2020, someone found us on Instagram and, unbeknownst to me, dropped our name with a Saks buyer. When the department store initially reached out, I thought it was a scam, and I didn't respond. Then, a vice president from the company DM'd me on Instagram.

I freaked out and was very scared. I thought: How are we going to do this? I even told them I needed time to figure it out because I didn't want to mess up this opportunity.

Saks really walked alongside us, gave us guidance, and helped us dip our toes slowly into its world. It was rapid-fire learning, trying to understand all the vendor requirements, including shipping and routing guidelines.

We hired more artisans in Nigeria. We beefed up our production. We worked on our supply situation. Everybody was winning; it helped us help other people grow their own businesses.

In 2023, Saks selected us to join its New Wave program for emerging designers. We came to New York, connected with industry experts and the press, and the company gave us a grant.

At the end, we had our products placed in the window at Saks' flagship store in New York. That was a remarkable moment for me and my team in Nigeria, who are so proud of this work. It was nothing that I could even have imagined for Elisamama.

The exposure it gave us was significant and gave us confidence.

We signed with a showroom and started selling in retailers like Shopbop, Tuckernuck, and several specialty boutiques. Things were ramping up, and the more I did this work, the more joy I found in it. In 2024, I left my corporate job.

Saks has been a great partner to us. It has placed orders with us every season since 2020. It's 50% or 60% of our business.

The problems started in February of last year, when Saks sent vendors a memo about paying in installments. Prior to that, we were consistently paid on the agreed-upon payment terms.

I thought: We can wait a few months to get paid. They're important partners.

We got a check for a couple of hundred dollars in July, and in August, we were paid a more substantial amount. I thought we were back on track and kept sending inventory. Then, no other payments came in.

We fulfilled two additional orders after that, operating on faith that things would shake out properly. The company kept saying it would get back to us with updates.

Now, Saks owes us six figures. I'm considering cutting half of our team to stay viable.

I employ 20 people full time in Nigeria; we have some consultants and contractors, as well. The amount Saks owes us means a lot.

When Saks' bankruptcy was announced in January, the ax dropped. Because of the proceedings, Saks said it'd prioritize debts incurred after January 13 and get back to us on other payments owed.

I have been trying to expand my partnerships and sales channels to protect my business, as we've been hearing about Saks' struggles for a long time.

I want to see Saks win, but I don't believe the company anymore. We're sitting on Saks' most recent order, given the situation.

I've told the buyers that any future shipments would have to be paid for before we ship. I'm also considering asking them to send back the inventory they have on hand, so at least we can cut our losses.

Saks is so powerful and significant in the fashion space that partnering with it is valuable. What's happened is a disappointment, but it's also grief and sadness.

Saks needs to restore trust with its suppliers by putting money behind its orders. If it did that, brands would continue to send goods because it's that important.

Davos, things just got exciting: Elon Musk will be in town.

Musk wasn't expected to attend the World Economic Forum. But a day after President Donald Trump's speech, the Tesla and SpaceX chief has been added to the schedule.

The world's richest man is now on the books for a session at 4:30 p.m. Swiss time on Thursday, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.

Flight data from ADS-B Exchange showed that Musk's private jet, a Gulfstream G650, took off from San Jose International Airport on Wednesday night local time and is traveling east. It's not yet clear whether Musk, who has been posting on X for the last several hours, is on the aircraft.

Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.

He's had a rocky public relationship with the organizers of Davos. In 2023, he made a post that questioned the need for the WEF.

""Are they trying to be the boss of Earth!?"" he wrote at the time.

Musk said in 2022 that he had declined an invitation to Davos, writing on social media that it was ""boring AF."" The WEF said at the time that he hadn't been invited since 2015.

More recently, the billionaire has drawn attention for his public feud with Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, after the latter said he wasn't interested in installing Starlink on his airline's fleet due to several drawbacks.

The WEF has not said what's on Musk's speaking agenda for Thursday. A WEF spokesperson confirmed that Musk is attending the event, adding that the forum has ""an outstanding tech delegation attending this year's meeting — companies and individuals who are shaping the future of their industries.""

Caroline Ellison, the former cryptocurrency executive and ex-girlfriend of Sam Bankman-Fried, is now a free woman.

Ellison, 32, was officially released from the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons on Wednesday after about 14 months, a BOP spokesperson told Business Insider on Thursday.

BOP spokesperson Donald Murphy said Thursday that Ellison was released Wednesday from what's known as community confinement, which means home confinement or a halfway house. As Business Insider previously reported, the ex-FTX insider was quietly moved to community confinement from a Connecticut prison in October after serving roughly 11 months of her two-year sentence.

Attorneys for Ellison declined to comment.

In December, online prison records listed Ellison's projected release date as February 20, but that date was pushed up about a month at some point, allowing for an even earlier release.

Ellison was sentenced to two years in prison in September 2024 after she pleaded guilty to conspiring with FTX founder Bankman-Fried in an $11 billion fraud scheme. The sentence also included three years of supervised release after prison time.

She was the CEO of Alameda Research, a trading firm founded by Bankman-Fried that helped FTX siphon money off of customers. Ellison was the star witness in Bankman-Fried's 2023 criminal trial.

At her sentencing hearing, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan commended Ellison for her ""very, very substantial cooperation"" and her genuine remorse.

However, the judge handed down a prison sentence because of the scale of the fraud, rather than the zero time behind bars her attorneys had asked for.

""For it to be a case this serious, to be a literal get-out-of-jail-free card — I cannot see a way to it,"" Kaplan said at the time.

Bankman-Fried was found guilty of seven counts of wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy charges in Manhattan federal court. He is serving a 25-year sentence at a federal correctional institution in Los Angeles while appealing his conviction and sentence.

In this article

President Donald Trump sued JPMorgan Chase and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, on Thursday for closing his and related entities' accounts in early 2021 after decades of being customers of the bank, allegedly for political reasons.

The closures came on the heels of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by Trump supporters at the U.S. Capitol, and the president exiting the White House later that same month after his electoral loss to former President Joe Biden was confirmed.

JPMorgan on Thursday denied that it closed Trump's accounts for political reasons, and suggested that the closures were due to federal rules and regulations that the bank has been seeking to change during this and prior presidential administrations.

Trump and the other plaintiffs in the case, which are business entities related to the president, are seeking at least $5 billion in civil damages.

""Plaintiffs are confident that JPMC's unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations, and JPMC's unsubstantiated, 'woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views,"" the lawsuit alleges.

""In essence, JPMC debanked Plaintiffs' Accounts because it believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so,"" says the suit, which was filed in state court in Miami-Dade County, Florida.

The suit says JPMorgan failed to disclose why the bank was terminating the accounts, but that the ""plaintiffs have subsequently learned that they were debanked as a result of political discrimination against President Trump, the Trump Organization, its affiliated entities, and/or the Trump family.""

The suit does not detail what the plaintiffs learned that substantiated that claim.

The suit also says that JPMorgan's ""reckless decision is leading a growing trend by financial institutions inthe United States of America to cut off a consumer's access to banking services if their political views contradict with those of the financial institution.""

In addition to alleging motivations for the closures, the complaint says that Trump and the plaintiffs ""have recently learned that JPMC — at the direction of Dimon — ""has unlawfully and unjustifiably published some or all of their names, including the names of President Trump, the Trump Organization with its affiliated entities, and/or the Trump family, on a blacklist.""

That purported blackist is accessible by federally regulated banks ""and is comprised of individuals and entities that have a history of malfeasant acts and are otherwise non-compliant with applicable banking rules and regulations,"" the suit says, while stating that the plaintiffs ""have always complied"" with banking rules and regulations.

The complaint does not give a formal name for that blacklist or indicate that it was part of a government regulatory apparatus.

The complaint alleges trade libel, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by JPMorgan.

It also alleges violations of Florida's Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act by Dimon.

In addition to Trump, the plaintiffs include Trump Payroll Corp. and various limited liability corporations.

JPMorgan, in a statement to CNBC, said, ""While we regret President Trump has sued us, we believe the suit has no merit.""

""We respect the President's right to sue us and our right to defend ourselves — that's what courts are for,"" said the bank's spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler. ""JPMC does not close accounts for political or religious reasons.""

""We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company. We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so,"" Wexler said.

""We have been asking both this Administration and prior administrations to change the rules and regulations that put us in this position, and we support the Administration's efforts to prevent the weaponization of the banking.""

California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday showed off knee pads that he suggested were for leaders ""selling out"" to the Trump administration. 

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Newsom said the red knee pads were available to buy via a website he had created. 

""The last round of knee pads sold out, just as our law firms are selling out. Many American universities are selling out, and yes, many corporate leaders are selling out to this administration,"" Newsom said.

""These are available in bulk, too,"" he said, holding up one of the knee pads, which showed U.S. President Donald Trump's signature.

On Tuesday, Newsom accused world leaders of ""rolling over"" for Trump. ""I can't take this complicity of people rolling over,"" Newsom said in Davos. ""I should have brought a bunch of knee pads for all the world leaders,"" he said.

A scheduled appearance by Newsom at USA House, described on its website as an ""official U.S. venue"" at Davos, was said to have been canceled on Wednesday soon after Trump addressed the forum. 

""I was going to speak last night. It was a well established event at the USA house, a simple conversation, discussion after Trump's speech. They made sure that I didn't. They made sure it was canceled,"" Newsom said on Thursday.

USA House is privately organized and does not represent the U.S. government. It is sponsored by large companies including Microsoft, Pfizer and blockchain company Ripple. 

Newsom is a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate and has previously sparred with Trump.

Oops, something went wrong

Strategy announced Wednesday that its perpetual preferred equity has grown larger than its convertible debt, with $8.36 billion in permanent capital now exceeding $8.21 billion in dated debt.

While this is a key milestone in defending the company's colossal Bitcoin treasury, experts suggest the design could contain the seeds of its potential failure.

The strategic shift essentially trades one risk for another.

By replacing debt deadlines with perpetual dividend payments, Strategy has erected a $14 billion financial shield—but one with severe fault lines that, if triggered, could force the very fire sale of Bitcoin it was built to prevent.

Perpetual preferred equity, as the name suggests, is a form of permanent capital with no maturity date. In layman's terms, the company sells a special kind of ownership shares that never expire.

In return, buyers receive fixed dividends, but the principal never needs to be repaid. It's like selling a slice of the company that pays steady income forever, removing the deadline risk but adding a constant cash cost.

The company can keep the money forever as long as it pays the dividends, which in this case, Strategy funds mostly by selling more shares, through Bitcoin appreciation, or from cash flow when needed. The company currently carries roughly $2.25 billion in cash reserves against an estimated $876 million in annual dividend obligations for these perpetual shares, per the official website.

The gap between obligations and $463.5 million revenue “must be funded externally,” Derek Lim, head of research at crypto market-making firm Caladan, told Decrypt.

Bitcoin Is Falling—Strategy Just Spent $2.1 Billion on BTC

With $2.25 billion in cash reserve and the current burn rate, Strategy has roughly 30 months of runway. “MSTR eventually runs out of cash,” Lim warned, adding that “if equity markets close entirely for an extended period.”

Financing done in this way has now grown to about $8.36 billion—slightly more than the old debt, per the recent announcement.

When Strategy started accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020, it did so using its existing corporate cash reserves. Soon after, they switched to issuing debt via convertible notes and equity.

It's like borrowing money from the bank with a fixed deadline to buy a house. If house prices crash temporarily, you still need to repay the bank on time. In such cases, you may be forced to sell the house at a loss to pay the bank.

The company's decision to shift aligns with CEO and founder Michael Saylor's “holder forever” Bitcoin thesis by eliminating the threat of forced selling to repay the debt. The $8.21 billion raised so far using convertible debt with maturity between 2027 and 2032 has so far involved refinancing with new equity or conversion to stock—all without selling any Bitcoin.

Strategy's earliest concrete test is a $1.01 billion ""put"" option on its 2028 notes that investors can exercise in September 2027, which could force a cash repayment if its stock price is too low.

With the maturity of convertible tranches between 2027 and 2032, it's a ticking clock regardless.

On prediction market Myriad, owned by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, users place a 25% chance on Strategy selling some of its BTC holdings by the end of the year.

Saylor's maturity playbook assumes favorable conditions, but its failure modes are clear:

A prolonged bear market is the first threat. Hypothetically, if Bitcoin crashes more than 50% and stays low for more than two years, as it did in previous bear markets, it erodes MSTR's stock premium. Raising new capital becomes prohibitively dilutive, strangling the funding model.

If MSTR's stock price stays low, debt holders won't convert, and refinancing, as a result, with new equity becomes impossible. If investor appetite vanishes, it would pressure the company to repay the obligations in cash or via Bitcoin sales, which is the second fault line.

“Unlike convertible debt, which can sit quietly, preferred dividends require ongoing cash payments,” Lim added. “If MSTR defers dividends, it signals distress. That signal will tank the stock. A lower stock price makes future equity issuance harder. Harder issuance makes future dividends less fundable. It's a reputational feedback loop.”

Strategy Pads Cash Reserve, Drops Another $116 Million on Bitcoin

The third potential point of failure is MSTR's high correlation to Bitcoin. Its status as a proxy for Bitcoin amplifies the top crypto's moves. This feature helped the company initially in refinancing or raising more cash between 2020 and 2024, as the stock price skyrocketed during Bitcoin's bull run.

That dynamic has changed recently, with MSTR now amplifying the downside. Bitcoin's 32% decline from $124,700 to $85,000 between early October and late November 2025 triggered a 52% crash in MSTR in the same period.

Bitcoin is trading at under $90,000, down almost 30% from its all-time high, according to CoinGecko data. A steep correction from here could trigger an investor exodus from MSTR, destroying its primary tool—equity sales—for funding dividends and refinancing, dismantling the fortress from within.

“The risks are deeply interconnected, and the feedback loops matter more than any single variable,” Lim said. “Bitcoin price decline causes mNAV to compress. That compression makes equity issuance value-destructive, eroding confidence and making dividend funding uncertain, which then depletes cash. It's a chain reaction.”

mNAV, or Market-to-Net Asset Value, is a metric that compares a company's market cap to the real-time market value of its crypto reserves to determine if the company's stock trades at a premium or discount to its crypto holdings. If mNAV is at a premium, it helps raise cash by issuing equity.

On Myriad, a majority of users expect Strategy's mNAV to slip to 0.85x, placing an 86% chance on this outcome rather than it rising to 1.5x.

These fault lines form a feedback loop. One stressor accelerates the others, pressuring Strategy into a potential death spiral.

“The most likely ‘bad' outcome isn't a spectacular blowup,” Lim concluded. “It's a slow grind where MSTR underperforms BTC for years due to dilution drag, eventually becoming a cautionary tale about corporate treasury strategies. That's arguably already happening.”

Strategy's experiment is a high-wire act balancing perpetual leverage against Bitcoin's volatility. Its success solidifies a corporate Bitcoin blueprint; its failure—a forced liquidation of even a fraction of its 710,000 BTC—would be a seismic event for crypto markets, testing the resilience of the very asset it was built to hold.

Coinbase has launched an Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain to proactively safeguard Bitcoin and other digital assets against potential future quantum threats.

Earlier this week, Coinbase announced the creation of an Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain, aiming to safeguard the crypto ecosystem against emerging quantum threats. 

The board will bring together leading experts in quantum computing, cryptography, and blockchain to assess risks and provide guidance to the broader industry.

Quantum computers, if scaled successfully, could compromise the cryptography that underpins major blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Coinbase, in their announcement, stressed that preparing for these future challenges is crucial to maintaining the security of digital assets.

The advisory board includes notable figures such as quantum computing pioneer Scott Aaronson, Stanford cryptography expert Dan Boneh, Ethereum researcher Justin Drake, and Coinbase's own Head of Cryptography, Yehuda Lindell. 

The group says they will publish position papers, recommend best practices for long-term security, and respond to significant advances in quantum computing.

This initiative is part of Coinbase's larger post-quantum security strategy, which also includes updating Bitcoin address handling, enhancing internal key management, and advancing research on post-quantum signature schemes. The board's first position paper is expected early next year, laying out a roadmap for quantum resilience in blockchain systems.

Coinbase said the move underscores the importance of proactive planning, ensuring the crypto industry remains prepared, not reactive, as quantum technology evolves.

Over the last several months, concerns over quantum computing's potential impact on Bitcoin have begun to ripple through traditional finance, prompting some investors to radically rethink their exposure to the cryptocurrency. 

Jefferies strategist Christopher Wood recently removed Bitcoin from his Greed & Fear model portfolio, citing the existential risk that large-scale quantum computers could undermine the cryptographic foundations securing digital assets. 

While the threat is not imminent, Wood and other institutional voices — including BlackRock and UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti — warn that quantum advances could eventually allow attackers to derive private keys from public ones, putting millions of BTC at risk. 

As a result, Wood replaced Bitcoin with gold and gold-mining equities, emphasizing that long-term store-of-value claims for digital assets may be less reliable in the face of accelerating technological change.

The debate over quantum computing in the Bitcoin ecosystem is intensifying. Coinbase research indicates that roughly 20% to 50% of Bitcoin's supply, particularly coins in older wallet formats, could be vulnerable to so-called long-range quantum attacks. 

Crypto developers and researchers are divided over the urgency of implementing quantum-resistant solutions, with some advocating proactive upgrades and others arguing the risk remains distant. 

Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor believes that quantum computing will actually strengthen Bitcoin rather than threaten it. Network upgrades and coin migrations will boost security, while lost coins remain frozen, Saylor posted.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum's price recently suffered a sharp decline, briefly dropping below the $3,000 level during heightened market volatility. ETH fell to an intraday low near $2,870 before stabilizing. 

While the move unsettled short-term traders, BlackRock argues Ethereum's long-term value lies beyond price action, rooted in its central role in tokenization.

BlackRock's Thematic Outlook 2026 describes Ethereum as the “toll road” for tokenization. The comparison highlights Ethereum's role as essential infrastructure rather than a speculative asset. As more financial instruments migrate on-chain, networks facilitating issuance, settlement, and compliance stand to benefit structurally.

The report notes that about 65% of all tokenized assets currently reside on Ethereum. This dominance gives the network a near-monopolistic position in tokenization markets. Growth in stablecoin usage already reflects tokenization in practice. As adoption expands, Ethereum is positioned to capture consistent network demand.

The real-world asset market reinforces this narrative. Tokenized RWAs recently reached a new all-time high of roughly $21 billion in total value locked. Ethereum alone accounts for approximately $11.6 billion of that figure, representing about 55% of the entire RWA market.

Such concentration suggests Ethereum's advantage is compounding rather than eroding. Issuers and institutions tend to build where liquidity, tooling, and security already exist. This dynamic strengthens network effects. Investors appear to be recognizing that Ethereum's leadership in RWAs could deepen as tokenization scales globally.

Long-term holder behavior aligns with this structural outlook. On-chain data shows Ethereum's net position change turning positive among long-term holders. Selling pressure from this group has faded after weeks of distribution. Accumulation has replaced selling, signaling renewed conviction.

Long-term holders often respond to fundamental developments rather than short-term price swings. Their shift toward buying suggests confidence in Ethereum's role within financial infrastructure. Reduced sell-side pressure from these holders may help ETH regain stability and support a recovery above key psychological levels.

Ethereum trades near $2,997 at the time of writing after rebounding from recent lows around $2,870. Price now sits just below the $3,000 threshold, a level closely watched by traders. Holding this zone suggests downside momentum is weakening as buyers re-enter.

BlackRock's acknowledgment of Ethereum's tokenization role could act as a sentiment catalyst. Improved confidence may help ETH reclaim $3,085 as resistance. A sustained move higher could extend gains toward $3,188, allowing Ethereum to recover a meaningful portion of its recent losses.

Downside risk appears limited under current conditions. A bearish scenario would require ETH to fall below $2,925 or $2,885. Losing those supports could expose Ethereum to a drop to $2,796. For now, improving macro signals and long-term accumulation reduce the likelihood of such a move.

On 8 January 2026, the ICO published its report on agentic AI, which sets out the ICO's understanding of the emerging technology and its potential capabilities, the novel data protection risks it presents, and its desire to encourage innovation within agentic AI that supports data protection rights. 

This report follows the ICO's commitment in its AI and biometrics strategy, published in June 2025, to work with industry to explore the data protection implications of agentic AI. 

Agentic AI

'Agentic AI' refers to systems that go beyond generative AI, by coupling language capabilities with tools, memory and adaptive decision‑making, so they can plan and act to complete open‑ended tasks with limited human direction. Whilst traditional software typically follows a fixed way to resolve problems, agentic AI may use its agentic capabilities to generate different ways to approach a problem. 

The report notes the potential use cases for agentic AI across various industries as capabilities, and user comfort, increase. Agentic systems could improve functions in the workplace, government services, cybersecurity (where they could potentially be used to harm, as well as protect, secure system), and commerce; 'agentic commerce agents' are already available, but we could see agents potentially anticipating shopping needs, factoring in budgetary constraints, and then making proactive purchases.

Data protection concerns

The report highlights the importance the ICO places on taking a privacy-positive approach to the innovation of agentic AI, noting that ""[i]n the context of data protection, AI agency does not mean the removal of human, and therefore organisational, responsibility for data processing.""

The report goes on to highlight a cluster of risks that go beyond those seen in standard generative AI deployments (which the ICO has already considered in previous consultations):

Practical considerations for privacy, risk, and product teams

Although the report is not formal guidance, it nevertheless highlights a set of action points for organisations that are building or deploying agentic AI systems:

The future of agentic AI

The ICO's report sets out four possible high-level scenarios for the adoption of agentic AI, all based on two key factors: the capability of AI agents, and the extent to which they are adopted:

These four scenarios formed the basis of the ICO's analysis of privacy and data protection considerations as they might present in future developments, and the issues identified within these scenarios will help inform future policy thinking.

In the ICO's view, scenarios 2 and 4 are likely to be of the most importance to organisations; both involve high adoption of agentic AI, making them the most likely scenarios in which organisations will be deploying or encountering these systems in practice. Scenario 2 highlights the risks of agentic systems which don't necessarily work well, whilst scenario 4 highlights the risks of agentic systems that work as designed, but still raise significant privacy concerns.

What's next?

The ICO has explained that it plans to take a proactive approach to regulating agentic AI, including: 

The regulator also explicitly calls out opportunities where agentic AI could improve compliance outcomes if designed well, such as data‑protection‑compliant agents, agentic controls (monitoring, auditing, permissions, authentication), privacy management agents, and information governance agents, plus methods for benchmarking and evaluation.

Given that the ICO is also developing a statutory code on AI and ADM (with implications for agentic AI), and updating guidance on ADM and profiling (in light of the Data (Use and Access) Act), this report fits in with the ICO's general direction of travel, and reaffirms that strong data protection foundations are essential to developing successful systems and building public trust in agentic AI systems.

Coinbase has announced it has assembled a team of experts to assess the emerging threat of quantum computing to cryptography. The exchange has recruited experts in computer science, cryptography, and fintech from Harvard and Stanford.

Coinbase, a U.S.-based crypto exchange, has announced the creation of a task force composed of experts in computer science, cryptography, and fintech from Stanford, Harvard, and the University of California. 

The team will investigate the potential risks posed by quantum computing to cryptography. The team will also involve experts from Coinbase, the Ethereum Foundation, and the DeFi platform EigenLayer. 

Coinbase Chief Information Security Officer Jeff Lunglhofer said in an interview that quantum computing could defeat current encryption mechanisms, including those designed to protect wallets and private keys where users store their digital assets. He emphasized that the underlying technology around crypto assets relies on complex mathematical problems that a regular computer would take “thousands of years to solve.” 

Bitcoin uses private keys to secure the network. These private keys are long strings of random numbers and letters that are visible only to their owners and can be guessed only through a long series of trial-and-error attempts. However, quantum computing has “a million times the horsepower,” enabling it to solve these problems more quickly.

Lunglhofer said the security risk exists. However, he noted that quantum computing is not an immediate threat to cryptography, and this may remain so for the next decade. The Coinbase exec's opinion aligns with that of other professionals, who say that large tech companies like Google have spearheaded the development of quantum computers and their capabilities over the last decade. 

However, their developments operate only at a small scale and lack advanced capabilities to decrypt the security mechanisms in the cryptocurrency ecosystem that protect Bitcoin and other blockchain networks.

Lunglhofer also highlighted that Coinbase's purpose for the new advisory board is to investigate the imminent impact of quantum computers in a “non-hype-based way,” to promote future security efforts. 

He added that when the quantum computing era begins, the industry will employ safety measures, including using larger private keys and using what he called “noise” to prevent computers from detecting the location of the keys. However, he said that incorporating these security measures will take years to implement.

Global Head of Investment Research at Coinbase, David Duong, also explained the quantum threat to cryptography in a LinkedIn post. He also noted that the threat is not immediate, but highlighted growing concerns among crypto investors about technological advancements. 

The Coinbase official said that quantum computers will solve “some of the world's most complex problems,” but they will also require upgrades to many of the cryptographic systems currently in use. 

According to Duong, the ultimate risk will emerge at what he called “Q-day,” when cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) will have the capacity to run Shor's and Grover's algorithms, jeopardizing Bitcoin's underlying cryptographic technology. 

Duong said that quantum computing poses two threats to cryptography, including the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for transaction signatures and SHA-256 for proof-of-work mining. 

He added that a breakthrough in quantum computing could create loopholes that attackers can exploit to breach private keys and steal from vulnerable wallets. Duong also mentioned that advanced quantum computers could mine blocks more efficiently, disrupting Bitcoin's economic and security model.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Hobbyists Were Scanning Satellite Images—And Stumbled Upon 4 Roman Marching Camps","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a70064487/roman-marching-camps/","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 13:30:00 GMT","

The camps, all located in Germany between the northern Harz Mountains and the Elbe River, were dated to the 3rd Century C.E.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Volunteers scouring satellite imagery pinpointed what they thought was evidence of Roman-era marching camps in Germany. On-the-ground investigation confirmed their thinking, leading to the discovery of four previously unknown third-century C.E. camps that show Roman advancement farther north in Germany than otherwise recorded. 

According to a statement from Germany's State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology Saxony-Anhalt, the four newly uncovered camps include two near Aken and one each at Trabitz and Deersheim, providing “evidence of Roman marching camps for the first time.”

With historical records chronicling the movement of Roman troops as far as the Elbe River, there was previously no evidence of a presence in Saxony-Anhalt. These finds change all that, showing the first proof of a Roman marching camp— typically located at intervals of about 12 miles, considered a day's march—between the northern Harz Mountains and the Elbe River, with the team calling the discovery an “archaeological sensation.”

A Roman marching camp has a distinct footprint, historically shaped like rectangles with rounded corners. From the gates, the main camp roads—laid out in right angles—led into the interior with camp headquarters placed at intersections. A key element of the camps was a titulum, a ditch segment with a defensive wall at the front of the gate passages. Similar infrastructure plans have been seen throughout history. 

These plans specifically were also seen as clear as day on satellite images that helped kick off this project. 

A volunteer archaeologist identified a potential marching camp near Aken in 2020 thanks to satellite images. Further targeted aerial surveys from the state office confirmed the presumed camp. Then in 2023, the team identified another potential site, this near Trabitz, thanks to aerial photos. Potential sites kept popping up, often thanks to remnants of the perfectly straight lines of ditch borders and the camp's rounded corners.

To corroborate the aerial clues, large-scale geophysical surveys incorporated metal detectorists. Teams recorded over 1,500 finds, mostly iron objects—the “high number of nails and bolts is striking”—that were once the hobnob nails meant to offer traction on a soldiers' sandals. A Caracalla denarius offered the newest find within a bounty of coins, making it conceivable that the camps were established in connection with a campaign under Caracalla in 213 C.E. Radiocarbon dating established the camps from the early third century C.E.

“The preliminary findings have confirmed the initial suspicion that the ditch structures discovered in aerial photographs are the remains of Roman marching camps,” the team wrote. 

The history of the region features centuries of fighting. In roughly 13 B.C.E., Emperor Augustus looked to move northeast, pushing as far as the Elbe and Saale rivers. This marching effort was considered abandoned in 9 C.E., after the adopted son and designated successor of Emperor Augustus fell from his horse and eventually died near Drusus during a retreat from the Saale. That led to the Romans withdrawing and even vacating a town near Lahnau-Waldgirmes. As a result, large Germanic tribes formed, and these tribes clashed with the Romans, sometimes leading to the Roman military moving deeper into Germanic territory.

Though the broad strokes of these conflicts have long been known, discoveries like this newly-uncovered marching camp offer up key details that aid in our understanding of the time.

Quantum computers hold the potential to surpass classical computers in solving complex computational problems. The fragility of quantum information and the error-prone nature of quantum operations necessitate the use of quantum error correction codes to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, most codes that have been demonstrated so far suffer from low encoding efficiency, and their scalability is hindered by prohibitively high resource overheads. Here we use a 32-qubit quantum processor to demonstrate two low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check codes, a distance-4 bivariate bicycle code and a distance-3 punctured bivariate bicycle code. Utilizing a two-dimensional architecture with overlapping long-range couplers connecting the qubits, we demonstrate the simultaneous measurements of all non-local weight-6 stabilizers via the periodic execution of an efficient syndrome extraction circuit. We achieve a logical error rate per logical qubit per cycle of (8.91 ± 0.17)% for the bivariate bicycle code with four logical qubits and (7.77 ± 0.12)% for the punctured bivariate bicycle code with six logical qubits. Our results establish the feasibility of performing quantum error correction with long-range coupled superconducting processors, demonstrating the viability of low-overhead quantum error correction.

Waymo robotaxis can now be hailed by the public in Miami. 

The company said Thursday it will initially open the service, on a rolling basis, to the nearly 10,000 local residents on its waitlist. Once accepted, riders will be able to hail a robotaxi within a 60-square-mile service area in Miami that covers neighborhoods such as the Design District, Wynwood, Brickell, and Coral Gables. 

Waymo said it plans to eventually expand to Miami International Airport, but didn't provide a timeline beyond that it was coming “soon.”

Waymo has had a presence in Miami for months in the lead-up to the commercial launch. After mapping and then testing its autonomous vehicles on Miami's public roads, the company removed safety operators from the fleet in November. The driverless service was initially open to employees.

This phased approach is part of Waymo's launch playbook, and one that is being implemented far more often than even a year ago. Waymo first opened its robotaxis to the general public in Phoenix in 2020. It expanded to San Francisco and Los Angeles and eventually opened it to all riders in 2024. As the company continued to expand in those metro areas — pushing into the larger Bay Area and into Silicon Valley, for example — it also opened in new markets. 

Waymo opened a robotaxi service in spring 2025 in partnership with Uber in Atlanta and Austin, and expanded its service area in existing markets to include freeways. 

Waymo has laid out an aggressive plan to bring its robotaxi service to nearly a dozen more cities over the next year. Those plans include Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Nashville, London, San Diego, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The company has already started testing in some of those cities using a mix of its all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles and newer Zeekr RT vans that have been rebranded “Ojai.”

Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last October that “by the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week.” 

The expansion hasn't been without problems. Residents in cities like San Francisco have captured video of Waymo vehicles creating traffic jams, notably during a widespread power outage in December. 

It has also gotten the attention of federal safety regulators.  

The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened an initial investigation into the company last October over how its robotaxis operated around a stopped school bus in Atlanta. School district officials in Austin have shared video and complaints around the same issue of Waymo moving past school buses even when the lights are on and the stop sign is deployed.

The company has issued a voluntary software recall to fix that issue. However, new videos, which show Waymos illegally passing school buses, suggest the problem has not been resolved.

The top talent behind yet another promising AI startup has been gobbled up by an incumbent. As part of a new licensing agreement, Google DeepMind is bringing on the CEO and several of the top engineers at voice AI startup Hume AI, reports Wired.

What's left of Hume AI will continue to supply its technology to other AI firms. No financial details of the deal were shared. 

TechCrunch has reached out to Google and Hume AI to confirm the news.

CEO Alan Cowen and about seven other engineers will work with DeepMind to improve Gemini's voice features, according to Wired. 

The Hume acqui-hire is the latest example of a leading AI firm scooping top talent off the market and skirting regulatory scrutiny by acquiring a startup's team rather than the company outright. Last year, Google acquired viral AI coding startup Windsurf's CEO and other top researchers, and OpenAI has acquired several startup teams in recent months, including Convogo and Roi. The Federal Trade Commission recently said that it would take a closer look at such deals. 

The deal also shows that voice is becoming the next frontier in AI.

Hume AI's secret sauce is its model's ability to understand a user's emotions and mood based on their voice. In 2024, the startup launched its Empathetic Voice Interface, a conversational AI with emotional intelligence. Hume AI has raised close to $80 million to date according to PitchBook, and expects to bring in $100 million in revenue this year, per Wired. 

But Hume AI isn't the only company working on voice-focused models. Google has been steadily improving its Gemini Live feature, which allows a user to have conversations with the chatbot. Last month, Google released a new native audio model for the Live API that improved the model's ability to “handle complex workflows,” per the Gemini API release notes. 

Others in the industry are investing big into voice capabilities as well. OpenAI is reportedly preparing to overhaul its audio models in preparation for its audio-first personal device, created with Jonny Ive's io, to launch this year. Recent leaks suggest the device could be a form of earbuds.

Last year, Meta also accelerated its AI audio push by acquiring startup Play AI. The Facebook-maker's Ray-Ban smart glasses are increasingly relying on voice and audio capabilities for tasks like helping you hear conversations in noisy rooms and enabling hands-free control for calls, texts, music, and photos. 

“Voice is the only acceptable input mode for wearables,” investor Vanessa Larco told TechCrunch. “This acquisition will only accelerate the need for voice apps.”

Demand continues to increase for voice capabilities. Earlier this month, ElevenLabs, the AI voice generation startup, said it crossed $330 million in annual recurring revenue.

Spotify is rolling out Prompted Playlists, a new AI playlist creation tool, to Premium subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. The feature, which was originally tested in New Zealand, allows users to make a playlist by describing what they want to hear, in their own words.

Prompted Playlists builds on an earlier AI playlist product, launched in 2024, which allowed for simpler prompts like “get focused at work with instrumental electronica,” or “get pumped up with fun, upbeat, and positive songs.”

Instead, the new Prompted Playlists feature lets users explain in more detail, and in a conversational mode, what they want to hear.

In a demo to press, for example, Spotify showed off a playlist that was built on a long prompt, which read “Find me one artist I haven't listened to yet, but would probably love, or an artist I've only heard one or two songs from, and introduce me to them. Build a playlist of songs that'll give me an overview of their catalog so it feels like I'm getting to know them. Put the songs you think I'll like the most in the top five spots.” 

The idea behind the new feature, explains J.J. Italiano, head of Global Music Curation and Discovery at Spotify, is to make it possible for anyone to build a playlist, even if they don't know much about music curation or the correct words to use.

“For most people,  isn't a part of their job. You don't always have the time or the energy to keep building the perfect playlist every time your mood changes, and that's where prompted playlists will come in,” said Italiano, whose team makes popular Spotify playlists like Today's Top Hits, New Music Friday, and Rap Caviar, among others. “This gives listeners access to that creative process without needing to know genres, or years, or industry language. You don't need the right words. You just need your words.”

“If you can describe a feeling, you can make a playlist,” he added.

The AI behind the feature analyzes the world of music in real time, including “trends, charts, culture, and history,” Spotify says, as well as the user's entire listening history since joining the service.

While the playlists are personalized to their creator by default, users can also use the tool to help break out of their usual listening habits and get different recommendations. That is, they can specifically tell the AI not to use their own listening history as a reference point, or they can direct it to introduce them to songs they've never heard before, as in the example above.

The prompts don't have to include any musical terminology, either. For instance, users could ask for a playlist inspired by the weather or a favorite TV show.

Because the prompts are shareable, the feature could also lead to a new type of creator — one who makes AI prompts that others will want to try. While the prompt itself would be the same, each user's resulting playlist would differ, as it's personalized to their own tastes and listening history. They could then modify that playlist further, if they chose. 

Spotify says Prompted Playlists are the “next evolution” of its earlier AI playlist feature. The new version is more tuned into real-time music trends and culture, understands the full arc of a user's listening behavior — not just what they've listened to recently — and offers deeper control. However, the older AI playlist feature will not be shut down. Instead, the two products will live side-by-side, which could lead to consumer confusion, given the similarities.

The feature will have some usage limits in place because it's still in beta, and those could change over time. It's also only available in the English language for the time being.

The company couldn't say when Prompted Playlists would reach global subscribers, noting that it first wants to learn from these initial markets to inform future launches.

Twenty years ago, a Duke University professor, David R. Smith, used artificial composite materials called “metamaterials” to make a real-life invisibility cloak. While this cloak didn't really work like Harry Potter's, exhibiting limited ability to conceal objects from the light of a single microwave length, those advances in material science did eventually trickle down to electromagnetism research.

Today, Austin-based Neurophos, a photonics startup spun out of Duke University and Metacept (an incubator run by Smith), is taking that research further to solve what may be the biggest problem facing AI labs and hyperscalers: how to scale computing power while keeping power consumption in check.

The startup has come up with a “metasurface modulator” with optical properties that enable it to serve as a tensor core processor for doing matrix vector multiplication — math that is at the heart of a lot of AI work (particularly inferencing), currently performed by specialized GPUs and TPUs that use traditional silicon gates and transistors. By fitting thousands of these modulators on a chip, Neurophos claims, its “optical processing unit” is significantly faster than the silicon GPUs currently used en masse at AI data centers, and far more efficient at inferencing (running trained models), which can be a fairly expensive task.

To fund the development of its chips, Neurophos has just raised $110 million in a Series A round led by Gates Frontier (Bill Gates' venture firm), with participation from Microsoft's M12, Carbon Direct, Aramco Ventures, Bosch Ventures, Tectonic Ventures, Space Capital, and others.

Now, photonic chips are nothing new. In theory, photonic chips offer higher performance than traditional silicon because light produces less heat than electricity, it can travel faster, and is far less susceptible to changes in temperature and electromagnetic fields.

But optical components tend to be much larger than their silicon counterparts, and can be difficult to mass-produce. And they also need converters to transform data from digital to analog and back, which can be large and take up a lot of power.

Neurophos, however, posits that the metasurface it has developed can solve all of those problems in one swoop because it is about “10,000 times” smaller than traditional optical transistors. The small size, the startup claims, enables it to fit thousands of units on a chip, which results in far more efficiency than traditional silicon because the chip can do many more calculations at once.

“When you shrink the optical transistor, you can do way more math in the optics domain before you have to do that conversion back to the electronics domain,” Dr. Patrick Bowen, CEO and co-founder of Neurophos, told TechCrunch. “If you want to go fast, you have to solve the energy efficiency problem first. Because if you're going to take a chip and make it 100 times faster, it burns 100 times more power. So you get the privilege of going fast after you solve the energy efficiency problem.”

The result, Neurophos claims, is an optical processing unit that can wildly outperform Nvidia's B200 AI GPU. The startup says its chip can run at 56 GHz, yielding a peak 235 Peta Operations per Second (POPS) and consuming 675 watts, compared to the B200, which can deliver 9 POPS at 1,000 watts.

Bowen says Neurophos has already signed multiple customers (though he declined to name any), and companies including Microsoft are “looking very closely” at the startup's products.

Still, the startup is entering a crowded market that's dominated by Nvidia, the world's most valuable public company, whose products have more or less underpinned the entire AI boom. There are also other companies working on photonics, though some, like Lightmatter, have pivoted to focusing on interconnects. And Neurophos is still a few years away from production, expecting its first chips to hit the market by mid-2028.

But Bowen is confident the performance and efficiency advances provided by its metasurface modulators will prove a sufficient moat.

“What everyone else is doing is, and this includes Nvidia, in terms of the fundamental physics of the silicon, it's really evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and it's tied to the progress of TSMC. If you look at the improvement of TSMC nodes, on average, they improve in energy efficiency about 15%, and that takes a couple years,” he said. 

“Even if we chart out Nvidia's improvement in architecture over the years, by the time we come out in 2028, we still have massive advantages over everyone else in the market because we're starting with a 50x over Blackwell in both energy efficiency and raw speed.”

And to address the mass-manufacturing issues optical chips have traditionally faced, Neurophos says its chips can be made with standard silicon foundry materials, tools, and processes.

The fresh funding will be used for the development of the company's first integrated photonic compute system, including data center-ready OPU modules, a full software stack, and early-access developer hardware. The company is also opening a San Francisco engineering site and expanding its HQ in Austin, Texas.

“Modern AI inference demands monumental amounts of power and compute,” Dr. Marc Tremblay, corporate vice president and technical fellow of core AI infrastructure at Microsoft, said in a statement. “We need a breakthrough in compute on par with the leaps we've seen in AI models themselves, which is what Neurophos' technology and high-talent density team is developing.”

I am especially impressed with the “i didn't write a single line of code” part, because I was expecting it to be janky or slow on mobile, but it feels blazing fast just zooming around different areas.And it is very up to date too, as I found a building across the street from me that got finished only last year being present.I found a nitpicky error though: in Brooklyn downtown, where Cadman Plaza Park is, your webite makes it looks like there is a large rectangular body of water there (e.g., a pool or a fountain). In reality, there is no water at all, it is just a concrete slab area.

I know you'll get flak for the agentic coding, but I think it's really awesome you were able to realize an idea that otherwise would've remained relegated to ""you know what'd be cool.."" territory. Also, just because the activation energy to execute a project like this is lower doesn't mean the creative ceiling isn't just as high as before.

Also, does someone have an intuition for how the ""masking"" process worked here to generate seamless tiles? I sort of grok it but not totally.

Reference image from the article:
https://cannoneyed.com/img/projects/isometric-nyc/training_d...You have to zoom in, but here the inputs on the left are mixed pixel art / photo textures. The outputs on the right are seamless pixel art.Later on he talks about 2x2 squares of four tiles each as input and having trouble automating input selection to avoid seams. So with his 512x512 tiles, he's actually sending in 1024x1024 inputs. You can avoid seams if every new tile can ""see"" all its already-generated neighbors.You get a seam if you generate a new tile next to an old tile but that old tile is not input to the infill agorithm. The new tile can't see that boundary, and the style will probably not match.

reply

More interestingly, not even the biggest smartest image models can tell if a seam exists or not (likely due to the way they represent image tokens internally)

I wonder if for almost any bulk inference / generation task, it will generally be dramatically cheaper to (use fancy expensive model to generate examples, perhaps interactively with refinements) -> (fine tune smaller open-source model) -> (run bulk task).

reply

Interestingly enough, the model could NOT learn how to reliably generate trees or water no matter how much data and/or strategies I threw at it...This to me is the big failure mode of fine-tuning - it's practically impossible to understand what will work well and what won't and why

I remember working for an ISP in the mid 90s. We never really had problems with 1 to 1 mailing loops bouncing back and forth, but we ended up with a large circular mailing loop involving a mailing list, and bad addresses on it getting bounced to the previous server which sent a reply to the mailing list, which got bounced and sent to everyone in the group which caused someone else's mailbox to fill up that was in a forward, which for some reason sent a bounce to the mailing list that really started to set off the explosive growth.Needless to say the bounces seemed to be growing quadratically and overwhelmed our medium sized ISP, a decent sized college, and a large ISPs mailing system in less time than anyone could figure out how to get it to stop.

As in a lot of cases, the answer is money. If you have expertise in Salesforce, you can get paid a lot, especially if the company you contract/freelance for is in an ""emergency"" which, because they use Salesforce, they'll eventually be.

IT were not stupid though, and set a series of rules:1. You cannot have a rule trigger to email yourself.2. You cannot reply to an email triggered by a rule.3. You have ~50MB max of emails (which was a lot at the time).Playing around one lunch, my friend had setup a ""not in office"" automated reply, I setup a rule to reply to any emails within our domain with a ""not in office"", but put their name in TO, CC and BCC. It turns out that this caused rule #2 not to trigger. After setting up the same rule on my friend's email, and sending a single email, the emails fired approximately one every 30 seconds.A few hours later we returned to our email boxes to realise that there were thousands and thousands of emails. At some point we triggered rule #3, which in turn sent an email ""out of space"", with a small embedded school logo. Each one of these emails triggered our email rule, which in turn triggered an email ""could not send message"", again with an embedded logo. We desperately tried to delete all of the emails, but it just made way for more emails. We eventually had to abandon our efforts to delete the emails, and went to class.About an hour later, the email server failed. Several hours later all domain logins failed. It turned out that logins were also run on the email server.The events were then (from what I was told by IT):* Students could not save their work to their network directory.* New students could not login.* Teachers could not login to take registers or use the SMART white boards.* IT try to login to the server, failure.* IT try to reboot the server, failure.* IT take the server apart and attempt to mount the disk - for whatever reason, also failure.* IT rebuild the entire server software.* IT try to restore data from a previous backup, failure. Apparently the backup did not complete.* IT are forced to recover from a working backup from two weeks previous.All from one little email rule. I was banned from using all computers for 6 months. When I finally did get access, there was a screen in the IT office that would show my display at all times when logged in. Sometimes IT would wiggle my mouse to remind me that they were there, and sometimes I would open up Notepad and chat to them.P.S. Something happened on the IT system a year later, and they saw I was logged in. They ran to my class, burst through the door, screamed by username and dragged me away from the keyboard. My teacher was in quite some shock, and then even more shocked to learn that I had caused the outage about a year earlier.

A few hours later we returned to our email boxes to realise that there were thousands and thousands of emails. At some point we triggered rule #3, which in turn sent an email ""out of space"", with a small embedded school logo. Each one of these emails triggered our email rule, which in turn triggered an email ""could not send message"", again with an embedded logo.

Unfortunately the app creation flow on GitHub makes it impossible (for now) for a normal org user to create an app for the org, so apps end up getting created on personal accounts and become load bearing. We've got a work item to make it possible to give app creation rights to your org members, I've got it high on the priority list for the next six months.Re:payment
As I understand it each org that uses the gemini cli agent puts their api key in their actions secrets, which gets picked up and used to call Google inference APIs. So the org these comments are in is paying for the inference.

Considering that these responses are all the exact same two replies in wording, and that this is a task which could be easily automated without AI, I seriously doubt that it's going to be caused by actual inference.

I've made ""reply bots"" before, bunch of times, first time on IRC, and pretty much the second or third step is ""Huh, probably this shouldn't be able to reply to itself, then it'll get stuck in a loop"". But that's hardly a ""classic CI bug"", so don't think that is what you're referring to here right?

reply

And there lie dragons, because whether a tired or junior or (now) not-even-human engineer is writing new sub-behavior, it's easy to assume that footguns either don't exist or are prevented a layer up. There's nothing more classic than that.

reply

Otherwise I still don't see how you'd end up with your own bot getting stuck in a loop replying to itself, but maybe I'm misunderstanding how others are building these sort of bots.

reply

1. Bot run a series of steps A through Z.2. Step X is calling an external system that runs its own series of steps.3. Some potential outcomes of said external system is if it detects some potential outcomes (errors, failed tests, whatever) is it kicks back an automated process that runs back through the bot/system where said system makes the same mistake again without awareness it's caught in a loop.

This I'd understand, bit trickier since you're basically end up with a problem typical of distributed systems.But one bot? One identity? One GitHub user? Seems really strange to miss something like that, as you say, it's one of the earlier things you tend to try when creating bots for chats and alike.

I presume this is due to using the base model, and not the one tuned for more expressiveness.edit: Or more likely, the demo not exposing the expressiveness controls.The 1.7B model was much better at ignoring slight background noise in the reference audio compared to the 0.6B model though. The 0.6B would inject some of that into the generated audio, whereas the 1.7B model would not.Also, without FlashAttention it was dog slow on my 5090, running at 0.3X realtime with just 30% GPU usage. Though I guess that's to be expected. No significant difference in generation speed between the two models.Overall though, I'm quite impressed. I haven't checked out all the recent TTS models, but a fair number, and this one is certainly one of the better ones in terms of voice cloning quality I've heard.

Now, maybe the results were cherrypicked. i know everyone else who has released one of these cherrypicks which to publish. However, this is the first time i've considered it plausible to use AI TTS to remaster old radioplays and the like, where a section of audio is unintelligible but can be deduced from context, like a tape glitch where someone says ""HEY [...]LAR!"" and it's an episode of Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar...I have dozens of hours of audio of like Bob Bailey and people of that era.

Have you tested alternatives? I grabbed Open Code and a Minimax m2.1 subscription, even just the 10usd/mo one to test with.Result? We designed a spec for a slight variation of a tool for which I wrote a spec with Claude - same problem (process supervisor tool), from scratch.Honestly, it worked great, I have played a little further with generating code (this time golang), again, I am happy.Beyond that, Glm4.7 should also be great.See https://dev.to/kilocode/open-weight-models-are-getting-serio...It is a recent case story of vibing a smaller tool with kilo code, comparing output from minimax m2.1 and Glm4.7Honestly, just give it a whirl - no need to send money to companies/nations your disagree with with.

I spent 20 minutes yesterday trying to get GLM 4.7 to understand that a simple modal on a web page (vanilla JS and HTML!) wasn't displaying when a certain button was clicked. I hooked it up to Chrome MCP in Open Code as well.It constantly told me that it fixed the problem. In frustration, I opened Claude Code and just typed ""Why won't the button with ID 'edit' work???!""It fixed the problem in one shot. This isn't even a hard problem (and I could have just fixed it myself but I guess sunk cost fallacy).

My experience is that all of the models seem to do a decent job of writing a whole application from scratch, up to a certain point of complexity. But as soon as you ask them for non-trivial modifications and bugfixes, they _usually_ go deep into rationalized rabbit holes into nowhere.I burned through a lot of credits to try them all and Gemini tended to work the best for the things I was doing. But as always, YMMV.

That evening, for kicks, I brought the problem to GLM 4.7 Flash (Flash!) and it one-shot the right solution.It's not apples to apples, because when it comes down to it LLMs are statistical token extruders, and it's a lot easier to extrude the likely tokens from an isolated query than from a whole workspace that's already been messed up somewhat by said LLM. That, and data is not the plural of anecdote. But still, I'm easily amused, and this amused me. (I haven't otherwise pushed GLM 4.7 much and I don't have a strong opinion about about it.)But seriously, given the consistent pattern of knitting ever larger carpets to sweep errors under that Claude seems to exhibit over and over instead of identifying and addressing root causes, I'm curious what the codebases of people who use it a lot look like.

Darth Maul has come a long way since Obi-Wan cut him in half: he got new legs! He also got a brother, and they both became crime lords until Palpatine showed up. But before his final encounter with Obi-Wan in Star Wars Rebels, he tried to build himself back up again, and that's what Star Wars: Maul—Shadow Lord is all about.

Set a year after the Clone Wars, which he survived during the Fall of Mandalore, our villain (again voiced by Sam Witwer) is working to rebuild the criminal empire that fell apart after his master showed up. The good news, he's doing it on Janix, a planet that's yet to succumb to the Empire. Bad news? More than that world's criminal various criminal elements, his actions draw the attention of not just the Inquisitors—in particular, Marrok, last seen in Star Wars: Ahsoka—but also seemingly a surviving Twi'lek Jedi named Devon Izara (Gideon Adlon) and local detective Brander Lawson (Wagner Moura).

Like Bad Batch before it, Shadow Lord is a mini-reunion of Star Wars animation alums. Not only is the series made by new Lucasfilm head Dave Filoni, but it also sees the return of Brad Rau, Matt Michonvetz, and Athena Portillo, all of whom wrote or directed episodes of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, along with Rebels and Bad Batch.

Star Wars: Maul—Shadow Lord will hit Disney+ with its first two episodes on April 6, with two episodes airing weekly. The series' voice cast also includes Dennis Haysbert, Richard Ayoade, and Vanessa Marshall.

The FBI raided the home of The Washington Post reporter and “federal government whisperer” Hannah Natanson last week. The agency seized her private laptop, work laptop, work phone, a 1 TB portable hard drive, a Garmin running watch, and a voice recorder she uses for work, according to newly released court documents.

For the past year, Natanson had been covering President Trump's reshaping of the federal government. One of her confidential sources, government contractor Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones, who previously held a top-secret security clearance, is being investigated by the FBI for an alleged national security leak.

Through her phone, the FBI gained access to Natanson's texts and voice recordings with confidential sources, including the 1,169 new sources who wrote to her, willing to share their experience working for the federal government under Trump.

Through her work computer, the FBI obtained extensive access to the Washington Post's operations. In a court declaration, Natanson said that the FBI now has access to her Google Drive and Proton Drive, a cloud-based service that she used to store sensitive information in encrypted form, both of which contain confidential information from sources. The FBI also has access to the Post's content management system, which she says “provides an enormous window” into all stories in progress at The Post, and the organization's Slack.

“Slack is how the Post newsroom often shares information from sources, originates and debates story ideas, and discusses edits to draft stories. Thus, having access to Slack is like having access to the Post newsroom,” Natanson said.

Natanson says she was only in communication with Perez-Lugones through her phone or Signal account.

“Given the huge volume of materials the government seized, any government review of the materials will necessarily expose information relating to confidential sources, unpublished newsgathering, and other journalistic work product that has nothing whatsoever to do with Perez-Lugones,” Natanson said.

The Washington Post has asked for an immediate return of all seized property. On Wednesday, a judge ruled that the government can keep the property but blocked them from reviewing the material, for now.

It was the first time the government raided a journalist's home for a national security leak investigation, according to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

“The outrageous seizure of our reporter's confidential newsgathering materials chills speech, cripples reporting, and inflicts irreparable harm every day the government keeps its hands on these materials,” The Post said in a statement to the court. “Anything less would license future newsroom raids and normalize censorship by search warrant.”

On September 30, 2024, the Sun unleashed a powerful explosion, causing magnetic field lines to break and reconnect in a criss-cross pattern. A Sun-observing probe was there to watch it unfold, gathering unprecedented data that's helping scientists better understand the mechanism behind solar flares.

Using the European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter spacecraft, a team of scientists discovered that solar flares are triggered by initially weak disturbances that grow more violent, similar to avalanches on snowy mountains. The process creates a sky of raining plasma blobs that continue to fall even after the solar flare has subsided, according to a new study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics.

Solar flares are giant explosions on the Sun, flinging energy, light, and particles into space. They take place when energy that's stored in twisted magnetic field lines is suddenly released. The most powerful solar flares can disrupt technologies on Earth, triggering geomagnetic storms capable of causing radio blackouts.

Scientists have observed solar flares for years, but they still lack a detailed understanding of how this colossal amount of energy is released so rapidly from the Sun. Using the high-resolution data from Solar Orbiter, scientists now have a better picture of the process that leads to the violent eruption.

Solar Orbiter zoomed in on a region of the Sun with a dark arch-like ‘filament' of twisted magnetic fields and plasma, linked to a cross-shaped structure of brightening magnetic field lines. Scientists directed the spacecraft's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) toward the region roughly 40 minutes before peak flare activity.

By zooming in, observations revealed new magnetic field strands appearing in every image frame—equivalent to every two seconds or less. Each strand was magnetically contained and twisted like a rope. The region became progressively less stable, just like in an avalanche.

The twisted magnetic field strands began to break and reconnect, rapidly triggering a cascade of further instability in the region. As the strands broke, they triggered progressively stronger reconnection events and outflows of energy, which appeared as increasing brightness in the images.

Then, a sudden brightening was followed by the dark filament disconnecting from one side, launching into space while violently unrolling at high speed. Scientists first recorded the unwinding at 155 miles per second (250 kilometers per second), rising to 248 miles per second (400 km/s) at the site of disconnection. Bright sparks of reconnection appeared all along the filament in stunning high resolution as the flare erupted.

“We were really very lucky to witness the precursor events of this large flare in such beautiful detail,” Pradeep Chitta, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen, Germany, and lead author of the paper, said in a statement. “Such detailed high-cadence observations of a flare are not possible all the time because of the limited observational windows and because data like these take up so much memory space on the spacecraft's onboard computer. We really were in the right place at the right time to catch the fine details of this flare.”

The scientists behind the study were surprised to learn that the large flare is driven by a series of smaller reconnection events that spread rapidly in space and time, creating a cascade of increasingly violent events.

Even before the flare erupted, the Solar Orbiter revealed that emissions from the Sun were slowly rising when the spacecraft first began observing the region. During the flare itself, particles were accelerated to speeds of 40 to 50% the speed of light.

The detailed observations also revealed that the energy was transferred from the magnetic field to the surrounding plasma during these reconnection events. “We saw ribbon-like features moving extremely quickly down through the Sun's atmosphere, even before the main episode of the flare,” Chitta said. “These streams of ‘raining plasma blobs' are signatures of energy deposition, which get stronger and stronger as the flare progresses.”

Even after the flare subsided, the rain of plasma blobs continued for some time, Chitta added.

“Solar Orbiter's observations unveil the central engine of a flare and emphasise the crucial role of an avalanche-like magnetic energy release mechanism at work,” Miho Janvier, ESA's Solar Orbiter co-project scientist, said in a statement. “An interesting prospect is whether this mechanism happens in all flares, and on other flaring stars.”

Essentially a free high-end GPU.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Following a gloomy bunch of GPU shipping stories on Reddit, we return with an extraordinarily positive tale that highlights the same system that often fails customers. One lucky customer bought an Asus ROG Astral RTX 5080 White OC on Amazon and received the GPU despite cancelling their order. Amazon then told them to keep the card and the refunded money, netting the user a free GPU worth $1,850.

The Redditor, u/spaceman293, posted in the r/ASUSROG subreddit, mentioning how they'd cancelled the Amazon order because Micro Center had the same GPU in stock. However, a few days later the RTX 5080 ended up showing up on their doorstep anyways. Once our diligent citizen informed Amazon of their mishap, the multi-trillion-dollar corporation generously told u/spaceman293 to just keep it.This win serves a stark contrast to the usual accounts we see on Reddit — most recently, someone who ordered an RTX 5080 received a relabeled RTX 5060 Ti instead. Funny enough, that case and this one are both results of the same system. Amazon is a big company with operations so sprawling that it's often not worth it for the retailer to go after smaller incidents — and sometimes, those end up favoring the customer.Delays in shipping go hand-in-hand with major vendors, so it's not strange to see a cancelled order still get delivered. By the time u/spaceman293 pulled out, there's a chance that the unit was already in the pipeline, ready to travel to its now forfeit destination. In these trying times, small victories like these are just as important to highlight as the upsetting ones.

 January 22, 2026  

Hearing aid (HA) prescription was not associated with meaningful improvements in memory or executive function in older adults with moderate hearing loss but was linked to a lower long-term risk for dementia.

Results of a large observations study of nearly 2800 older adults showed overall cognition scores during 7 years of follow-up were similar between adults who did and did not receive a prescription for HAs. However, the 7-year risk for cognitive impairment was 15% lower for those with HA prescriptions, and the risk for dementia was 33% lower.

Although treating hearing loss with HAs may have limited influence on age-related cognitive change, the link with lower risk for dementia was “striking,” the investigators noted.

However, “further studies are needed to understand the ways [HAs] may support memory, thinking, and brain health overall,” study investigator Joanne Ryan, PhD, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, said in a release.

The findings were published online on January 14 in Neurology.

In 2017 and in a 2020 update, The Lancet commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care named hearing impairment as one of the most significant risk factors for dementia.

However, as reported by Medscape Medical News, previous studies assessing HAs' role in affecting cognition and/or dementia have shown mixed results.

For the current study, investigators assessed data from 2777 Australian participants aged 70 years or older (mean age, 75 years; 52% men; 98% White) from the ASPREE study.

At baseline, all participants were dementia-free and had moderate hearing impairment.

Questionnaires were used to measure new HA prescriptions (n = 664) and frequency of use. Semiannual assessments over 7 years measured cognition.

The primary outcome was overall cognition score, which combined the following tests from the ASPREE cognitive battery: the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (for learning and memory), the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (for language and executive function).

Secondary outcomes included a dementia diagnosis or the presence of cognitive impairment, which was defined as a composite of dementia and cognitive decline.

Results showed that the mean difference in overall cognition scores at year 7 between those with HA prescriptions and those without was insignificant at 0.03.

The investigators noted that this finding “provides class III evidence” that the prescribing of HAs did not substantially change cognitive scores in this particular population.

“Similarly, there was little evidence in the overall cognition score under initiation of different frequencies of HA use,” they wrote.

Ryan added that most of the study participants had good cognitive health at baseline, which may have reduced the potential for later cognitive improvement with HAs.

In contrast, the adjusted estimated 7-year risk for dementia was 5% in those with HA prescriptions vs 7.5% in those without the prescriptions (risk ratio [RR], 0.67), and the 7-year risk for cognitive impairment was 36.1% vs 42.4% (RR, 0.85). Additionally, the risk for each of these outcomes “were inversely associated with the frequency of HA use,” the investigators wrote.

The authors cautioned that the findings may reflect residual confounding rather than a true treatment effect and added that longer-term randomized and observational studies would be “a valuable next step.”

The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute on Aging, the Australian Government, and the Monash University. Two of the investigators reported several financial disclosures, which are fully listed in the original article. The other researchers reported no relevant financial relationships.

 January 22, 2026  

A 44-blood metabolite signature may help predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) beyond traditional risk factors, according to a new study based on data from more than 20,000 individuals without baseline diabetes.

“Integrating these data in large samples allowed us to identify early metabolic pathway changes that precede type 2 diabetes, providing new insights into disease mechanisms,” said Jun Li, MD, epidemiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.

“By further examining how genetics and modifiable lifestyle factors, such as diet, physical activity, and body weight, are related to these metabolites, our findings help shift the field toward more precise and potentially more effective strategies for preventing type 2 diabetes,” Li told Medscape Medical News.

The human metabolome — the composite of all small molecules in a biological sample — provides insight into biochemical processes, disease states, and drug responses. However, “despite decades of research, the precise biological mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes are still not fully understood, and effective prevention strategies remain limited,” said Li.

“At the same time, recent advances in metabolomic technologies, together with the growing availability of large, long-term population studies, have made it possible to move beyond single biomarkers and systematically map entire metabolic pathways related to diabetes risk,” she said.

Li and her colleagues sought to examine how circulating metabolites, along with genetics and lifestyle, might predict T2D risk.

In their study, published in Nature Medicine, the researchers used data from 23,634 adults from 10 prospective cohorts with up to 26 years of follow-up and no baseline T2D. The researchers analyzed 469 metabolites in blood samples, along with genetic, diet, and lifestyle data. A total of 235 metabolites were associated with a higher or lower risk of developing T2D.

Additional genetic analyses connected the metabolites to features of T2D pathophysiology including insulin resistance, glucose-insulin response, ectopic fat deposition, energy-lipid regulation, and liver function. When the researchers added lifestyle factors to the mix, they found that lifestyle factors, notably physical activity, obesity, and diet, had a stronger effect on variations in T2D-associated metabolites than on variations in metabolites not associated with T2D.

Based on their findings, the researchers created a signature consisting of 44 metabolites that was an effective predictor of T2D risk in independent testing cohorts, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.62 to 0.86. In a multivariable analysis of all the cohorts in the study, individuals in the highest decile of the metabolomic signature had approximately five times the risk of developing T2D compared with those in the lowest decile (risk ratio, 5.07; 95% CI, 4.02-6.39).

The overall results of the research were not unexpected, Li said. “For example, our integrative analyses of metabolites and genetics showed that metabolites associated with type 2 diabetes are genetically linked to organ systems central to the disease, such as the pancreas, liver, and adipose tissue.”

However, the researchers were surprised by how strongly and independently many of the metabolites associated with T2D were linked to modifiable lifestyle factors, especially diet, physical activity, and body weight. “This finding underscores the substantial influence that lifestyle factors may have on human metabolism and highlights their potential role in more effective strategies for preventing type 2 diabetes,” said Li.

She acknowledged that additional studies are needed before the results can be translated into clinical practice but noted that several potential applications can be explored. “One promising direction is the use of our 44-metabolite signature for improved type 2 diabetes risk assessment,” said Li. “In our study, this signature enhanced risk prediction beyond traditional clinical risk factors across multiple cohorts, suggesting it could eventually help identify individuals at higher risk earlier and more precisely,” she explained.

“Another potential application is in dietary and lifestyle intervention trials,” said Li. Given that many of the metabolites identified were related to modifiable risk factors, “the signature could be used to monitor individual metabolic responses to interventions, helping to evaluate effectiveness and potentially tailor strategies to maximize benefit.”

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the study findings, Li told Medscape Medical News. The study's observational design prevents conclusions about causality or the biological mechanisms linking specific metabolites to T2D risk, she said. Experimental and mechanistic studies will be needed to clarify whether and how these metabolites play a causal role in disease development.

In addition, although the study included participants from multiple racial and ethnic backgrounds, approximately 77% of participants were non-Hispanic White, which limited the researchers' ability to fully examine potential differences in associations across ethnic groups. More clinical trials are needed to validate the signature in diverse populations, Li said.

Studies are also needed to assess the performance of signature as a predictor in real-world clinical settings and to determine how the changes in a person's metabolite profile over time align with response to interventions and risk reduction, she added.

“Diabetes prevalence is rising globally, and current risk models incompletely capture the chronic disease's complexity,” said Charles Leonard, PharmD, MSCE, MPH, associate professor at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the current study.

Metabolomics makes possible the integration of metabolic, genetic, and lifestyle data to improve risk stratification and prevention, he told Medscape Medical News.

Although the new findings were not unexpected, “the breadth of associations was striking,” said Leonard. “The findings are an important reminder that type 2 diabetes is a systemic metabolic disorder, not just an issue with glucose.”

Ultimately, metabolomic signatures could complement traditional diabetes risk factors in identifying high-risk patients and supporting tailored prevention strategies, he said.

Looking ahead, “Replication in diverse populations is key, followed by investigations of whether metabolomic-guided interventions reduce diabetes incidence,” said Leonard. “Implementation research would likely be critical for integrating new tools into clinical practice.”

The study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; the New York Regional Center for Diabetes Translation Research via a grant from NIDDK; the National Institute on Aging; and a cooperative agreement from the National Human Genome Research Institute.

Li and Leonard reported having no financial conflicts to disclose.

Imaginary friends are common in early childhood and are usually a normal feature of cognitive and emotional development. For clinicians, the key challenge is distinguishing typical imaginative play from patterns that may signal emotional distress or neurodevelopmental concerns that require further assessment.

An imaginary friend is a fictional character that a person, most often a child, creates mentally and interacts with as if the character were real. Talking with invisible dragons, having tea with invented heroes, or sharing secrets with companions only the child can see are part of normal development and do not usually indicate a psychological disorder. This phenomenon typically fades with age and cognitive maturation.

Research suggests that up to 65% of children have had an imaginary friend by age 7, according to landmark studies by Marjorie Taylor, PhD, and Stephanie Carlson, PhD, originally published in Developmental Psychology. Among imaginary friends still active at age 7, 67% were invisible, while 33% were personified objects, such as stuffed animals with distinct personalities. The studies showed that having an imaginary friend is a common and normative activity and is positively associated with better emotional understanding and an enhanced ability to take others' perspectives.

“Imaginary friends appear as a natural part of the development of symbolic play and imagination,” said Tania Ruiz, a psychopedagogue specializing in learning and educational psychology and a therapeutic coordinator at Anda CONMiGO, a Spanish network of multidisciplinary centers caring for children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental and learning disorders.

“They are most frequent between ages 3 and 7, a period marked by intense creativity, during which the distinction between fantasy and reality is still under construction.”

Imaginary friends can take many forms, including people, animals, animated objects, or fantastical beings. “Beyond appearance, what matters is the function they serve,” Ruiz explained. “Some provide protection, others act as play companions, and others embody aspects of the child, such as bravery or strength. Through these figures, children organize their inner world and rehearse the management of needs, desires, and conflicts.”

From an emotional perspective, imaginary friends allow children to express fear, anger, sadness, or unmet desires that they may struggle to communicate directly. They function as a tool for making sense of emotions and practicing coping strategies. Cognitively, this type of play stimulates language development, narrative skills, planning, cognitive flexibility, and symbolic thinking. By creating stories, dialogues, and scenarios, children exercise executive functions and problem-solving abilities.

“Concern arises when play becomes rigid; the child does not tolerate questioning or modifying the imaginary friend; the content is persistently violent; the presence of the friend causes distress, isolation, or fear; or when it coexists with other warning signs involving language, social interaction, or behavior,” Ruiz cautioned.

Most children with imaginary friends fall within typical developmental limits. In some cases, however, imaginary friends may be associated with:

In such situations, the imaginary friend is not the cause of the difficulty but rather a potential indicator that the child is attempting to cope with an experience that is difficult to manage.

In ADHD, imaginary friends may serve as a space for creative expression and internal play and are not inherently concerning. In some cases, they may intersect with impulsivity or with difficulty distinguishing imagined events from those that actually occurred. These issues are typically addressed through psychoeducation and interventions focused on emotional regulation.

In autism spectrum disorder, the situation differs. Many children have difficulty developing complex symbolic play, making elaborate imaginary friends less common. When they do appear, it is important to determine whether the behavior reflects functional symbolic play or stems from restricted interests, rigid routines, or literal thinking that the child transforms into a constant “presence.” In all cases, imaginary friends are never interpreted in isolation but rather within the context of the child's overall developmental profile.

When play involving an imaginary friend reflects intense fears, internal conflict, issues of control, or anxiety, the therapeutic goal is not to eliminate the character but to understand its function and support what the child is expressing through it.

“In therapy sessions, clinicians observe what the imaginary friend represents — protection, authority, fear, or companionship — and identify emotional themes that emerge repeatedly, such as abandonment, frustration, or insecurity,” Ruiz explained. “From there, symbolic resources are introduced, including new characters, alternative stories, or different endings, to help the child process these experiences. At the same time, the therapist puts words to what is happening in the play to support emotional identification and organization.”

This work is always carried out in coordination with the family. Parents are informed about the role of the imaginary friend and given guidance on how to support the child without reinforcing fears or invalidating imagination. When clear warning signs emerge, such as extreme rigidity, distress, interference with daily functioning, or persistent confusion between fantasy and reality, a more comprehensive evaluation and coordinated intervention with mental health services is recommended.

Wolfgang Paik

 January 22, 2026  

A 32-year-old man with previously undiagnosed Poland syndrome presented with acute, severe, tearing chest pain radiating to the back, which worsened when lying down and improved when sitting. The cardiac physical examination was negative for murmur and friction rub. ECG showed focal ST-segment elevations in precordial leads V2-V4, and serial troponin levels were negative.

Life-threatening cardiac causes of chest pain, such as acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax, were ruled out using CT. Three of four criteria for acute pericarditis were met.

The case report by Gautami S. Patel, MD, from Pramukhswami Medical College, Karamsad, India, and colleagues documented a rare congenital anomaly characterised by unilateral absence or hypoplasia of the pectoralis major muscle.

The patient presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain. He reported that the pain had started approximately 24 hours before presentation and had progressively worsened. The pain was central in location, tearing in nature, and radiating to the back. He rated it as 8/10 in intensity, significantly limiting his ability to speak and provide a detailed history. The pain was exacerbated by deep inspiration and lying down and improved when sitting up. However, there was no association with food intake. He had not experienced any similar symptoms in the past. The patient also reported associated shortness of breath. He did not report abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, cough, or headache. He had no recent illness or sick contact. The patient's past medical history was notable for congenital chest wall asymmetry, brachydactyly, and syndactyly, with no established diagnosis of Poland syndrome. He had no history of cardiac disease or frequent hospitalisations and was not on any regular medications. The surgical history included an appendectomy approximately 15 years ago and corrective surgery for webbed fingers 3 years ago. He was unable to provide a picture of his hand prior to surgery. There was no known family history of similar chest wall or limb abnormalities. No genetic testing was performed in the past, according to the patient. He was a nonsmoker, did not consume alcohol, and reported no substance use. He was independent in all activities of daily living and worked in construction sector.

The patient's vital signs were measured upon admission. Blood pressure was 132/85 mm Hg while supine, heart rate was 80 beats/min, respiratory rate was normal, and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. His body temperature was 98.3 °F. Initial laboratory tests were unremarkable except for mildly elevated C-reactive protein level of 2.4 mg/dL. Serial troponin levels obtained on admission and after 6 hours were not indicative of myocardial injury. Urine toxicology, urinalysis, and respiratory viral panel results were negative. Blood culture showed no growth after 5 days.

Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest showed no filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature. The pulmonary arteries, aorta, and other great vessels appeared unremarkable.

Patchy opacities were noted in the bilateral lower lobes. No evidence of pneumothorax, mediastinal widening, or lymphadenopathy was observed. The osseous structures were also unremarkable. The CT scan of the chest also revealed notable asymmetry of the thoracic musculature. The left pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles were not visualised at the level of the sternum, consistent with congenital absence.

A CT angiogram of the chest and abdomen showed normal thoracoabdominal aorta.

The cardiac silhouette was normal in size, and there was no evidence of coronary artery calcification or pericardial effusion. ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle branch block and localised S-T elevations in precordial leads V2, V3, and V4. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a normal-sized left ventricular cavity with an ejection fraction of 55%-60%.

Trivial anterior pericardial effusion with preserved ventricular function. Based on the overall findings, Poland syndrome with acute pericarditis was diagnosed. Treatment with 0.6 mg/d colchicine and 25 mg indomethacin three times daily led to complete resolution of all symptoms within a week.

“To our knowledge, there are no reported cases of pericarditis in patients with Poland syndrome. However, hypothetically altered chest wall anatomy in Poland syndrome may predispose patients to pericardial irritation, leading to pericarditis, which is idiopathic in nature. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by congenital anatomical anomalies of Poland syndrome when evaluating acute chest pain,” wrote the authors. Although no established pathophysiologic association exists between Poland syndrome and pericardial inflammation, altered thoracic anatomy may complicate physical examination, ECG interpretation, and imaging findings. Isolated reports describe other thoracic complications in Poland syndrome, including right atrial angiosarcoma, diaphragmatic hernia, spontaneous pneumothorax, and chylous pneumothorax in patients presenting with chest pain and dyspnoea.

Welcome back to World Cup Countdown—The Ringer's monthly column previewing the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Each month, we'll cover everything shaping the tournament, from the U.S. men's national team to the stars and story lines abroad that will define qualifying and the buildup to the opening match. Here's where we stand 140 days before kickoff. 

The Senegal players after winning the AFCON final on January 18

Near the end of Sunday's Africa Cup of Nations final, all decorum seemed to leave Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, Morocco. For 14 minutes of Sunday's title match between Senegal and host Morocco, Rabat was plunged into a state of pure chaos. A controversial VAR review deep in stoppage time awarded Morocco a contentious penalty with the score tied 0-0. The ensuing Senegalese protest stretched into the crowd, entered the media section, and led to the Senegalese players leaving the field in protest. 

When they finally returned to the pitch after 14 minutes, all the pressure was on Moroccan star Brahim Díaz. The Real Madrid attacker had a golden opportunity to make Moroccan history if he converted his penalty with essentially the final kick of the game, and it seemed like the AFCON hosts were about to receive their storybook ending after all. Morocco hadn't won Africa's top soccer prize since 1976, and the eager home fans in Rabat were waiting to erupt. Instead, Senegal's extended protest seemingly iced the kicker. For reasons that we may never fully comprehend, Diaz tried a Panenka penalty. Senegal goalkeeper Édouard Mendy didn't flinch, easily catching the weak attempt and sending the game to extra time. Senegal's Pape Gueye scored four minutes into the extra period, and the Lions of Teranga won their second AFCON title in three tries. 

You won't find a soccer tournament that's more consistently competitive and exhilarating than the one AFCON puts on every two years—although it looks like that frequency could be changing. In 2023, Ivory Coast fired its coach mid-tournament before going on to win it. In 2015, Ivorian goalkeeper Boubacar “Barry Copa” Barry not only saved two penalties but also converted the winning kick in a 22-attempt shoot-out against Ghana. Sunday's final is another chapter in incredible AFCON lore, even if the scenes in Rabat weren't the most sportsmanlike. 

As much as we all love week-to-week grind of league soccer, the drama gets smoothed out over the course of months. AFCON was a reminder that when you concentrate all that energy into a single-elimination international event, one moment can tilt the trajectory of an entire country's sporting year. 

Six Instant Reactions to the 2026 World Cup Draw

Six Instant Reactions to the 2026 World Cup Draw

Senegal and Morocco are the two highest-ranked African teams in the FIFA rankings. They are also the top two African teams if you rate each squad by average transfermarkt value. At the last World Cup, they were the only two from the continent to advance out of the group stages. The North Africans made it all the way to the semifinal—the furthest any African side has ever gotten—and many will expect Morocco to advance out of its World Cup group, which also includes Brazil, Haiti, and Scotland. But Senegal has a much tougher challenge. The Lions of Teranga will face off against both France and Norway in their group, which is unquestionably the most difficult on paper. Sadio Mané said that this was his final AFCON tournament, which will also likely make 2026 his World Cup send-off for the national team. 

After those two sides and the Ivory Coast, there is a drop-off in the overall talent level of the next tier of African contenders. Because fourth- and fifth-ranked (by squad value) Cameroon and Nigeria failed to qualify for this summer's tournament, the second tier of African World Cup contenders will start with Algeria, Ghana, and Egypt. Egypt will go as far as Mo Salah and Omar Marmoush can carry it, while Algeria and Ghana have proved in past generations that they can compete with some of the world's top heavyweights.

And getting more time with their national teammates could prove to be an advantage for the seven African teams that got a trial run at tournament soccer before the World Cup in four months. 

Mauricio Pochettino voicing directions to his players during an international friendly game between Japan and the USMNT

This section focuses on the United States men's national team as it prepares to host the World Cup.

The United States men's national team will play only four matches between now and the start of the 2026 World Cup. And there are just two contests—against Belgium and Portugal in March—before Mauricio Pochettino has to pick his squad. 

Over the past year, the former Tottenham manager has treated the USMNT like a laboratory. He's shifted and challenged reputations, he's pushed back against the idea of an A team, and he's waved away the confusing and occasionally lackluster results of his experiments. Now, the tinkering phase is nearly over.

There are a handful of players who should rightfully be seen as locks, but the starting XI remains murky. Here are my best predictions on the starters for the June 12 World Cup opener against Paraguay:

Freese has started the past 12 games in goal for the USMNT and has established himself as one of the top keepers in MLS. The starting goalkeeper job is his to lose now. His heroics in goal for NYCFC last season helped lead the New Yorkers to the MLS Cup conference finals, so American fans shouldn't expect another keeper to supplant him in the USMNT's rotation before June. His only real competition is expected to be Matt Turner, who didn't even make the November roster and has been struggling to find consistent minutes under Pochettino. 

Pochettino tested out a back three formation on multiple occasions in the second half of 2025. And operating with only three defenders does seem to better fit the tactical strengths of some of his personnel, freeing up his more creative wide players to attack more as wingbacks instead of sitting back like more traditionally conservative fullbacks. However, playing three at the back also increases the risk that 38-year-old Tim Ream's lack of athleticism will be exposed as he gets dragged out wide to cover the space left by his roaming teammates. 

Center back remains one of the thinnest parts of the American squad. Chris Richards—a mainstay at the heart of the Crystal Palace defense, which has never finished lower than ninth in the league in any season he's been there—is one of the first names on the team sheet at this point. Finding a suitable partner who will play to his level might be difficult, but Mark McKenzie, Ream, or Miles Robinson could be called on to compete alongside him in that back three.

Antonee Robinson returned from injury in December and has started seven consecutive league games for Fulham. He hasn't played for the USMNT since October 2024 due to various injuries, but he remains the clear best option for the Americans here. Robinson's crossing ability was among the best in the Premier League in the last two seasons he was healthy (in 2023-24 and 2024-25), and he's an incredibly active defender.Both Alex Freeman and Max Arfsten have had various standout moments filling in for Sergiño Dest and Robinson, but Dest—who has been solid for PSV Eindhoven when healthy—and Robinson provide the most forward thrust and attacking quality from the wingback position. 

Tyler Adams's recovery from a torn MCL is one of the most important developments between now and the start of the World Cup. He suffered the injury in Bournemouth's game against Manchester United in mid-December and was expected to miss three months, which should give him more than enough time to get into top fitness before the tournament. However, given Adams's extensive injury history, his health is far from a certainty.The USMNT has tried different players in the central midfield role in his absence, but none have come close to matching his defensive tenacity and ball-winning ability. Cristian Roldan seems to be one of Pochettino's favorites; the Seattle Sounders stalwart started three of the USMNT's five friendlies to conclude 2025. But Weston McKennie's pedigree and ceiling could ultimately convince Pochettino to start him in the World Cup. The USMNT veteran has appeared in 20 of 21 games for Juventus this year—the real question may be what his best role is with the American squad and whether he's more suited to playing farther forward.

The only person who's scored more goals than Pulisic in Serie A this season is Lautaro Martinez, and the former remains one of the most vital members of this USMNT squad. The spot next to him is more uncertain. Pochettino really seemed to like Malik Tillman's pressing intensity and energy at the Gold Cup last summer. But if the Argentine is set on playing a back three, he'll want an attacking midfielder who can complement Dest. Given that, the best choice is probably Weah. In the past, Weah has played as a winger, fullback, and wingback for the USMNT and Juventus, and his versatility has earned him a lot of minutes at Marseille this year.

Balogun has always passed the eye test as the Americans' best striking option. Now he's also putting up the goals to prove it. He scored three times in his three fall starts for the USMNT and has seven goals combined in Ligue 1 and the Champions League this season. 

This section focuses on the shifting fortunes of players, managers, characters, and nations who could play a significant role next summer. 

Xabi Alonso during the Spanish Super Cup final between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid

Online tacticos, analytics nerds, and soccer commentators alike have been plenty critical of former Real Madrid managers Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane for their lack of tactical acumen while managing the team. But Xabi Alonso flamed out of the job in 233 days, maybe proving that Zidane's and Ancelotti's skills as managers and leaders of soccer's biggest megastars were underrated after all. Alonso struggled to get the dressing room to believe in his vision, and players reportedly described him as “distant and unapproachable.” Alonso's run at Bayer Leverkusen—including an undefeated season in the Bundesliga—was extremely impressive, but it's a much different challenge stepping up to manage one of the most successful clubs in the world. Now that the job is open, it will be interesting to see the direction Florentino Pérez and Real Madrid go. Will a new hire happen before this summer's tournament? Would Ancelotti come back after managing Brazil at the World Cup? And since Zidane is reportedly eyeing managerial duties for his native France when Didier Deschamps leaves his post, could Madrid still be searching for their man in August? Only time will tell.

The soccer analytics community lost a valued resource this week when Sports Reference announced that “the provider of our advanced soccer data sent us a letter terminating our access to their data feeds.” FBref has long been one of the most abundant and accessible data sources in the sporting world. It's provided an invaluable resource for anyone interested in learning the game and finding new ways to understand soccer beyond what's visible on the pitch, and speaking personally, it's been the most informative soccer resource on the internet. It truly feels like the end of an era—and a significant loss for analysts, writers, and fans alike. FBref has done incredible work to help the layperson better understand a sport that is notoriously complex and difficult to quantify and will be sorely missed. 

Each month, the World Cup Countdown selection committee (me) will highlight some of the best, worst, and strangest moments in the sport.

Zohran Mamdani after a press conference announcing his petition urging FIFA to drop dynamic ticket pricing for next summer's World Cup

New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani did something rare for an American politician: He's actually demonstrated elite ball knowledge. Mamdani hosted a watch party on Sunday in Manhattan's Surrogate's Court for the wild AFCON final between Senegal and Morocco. He's also made the World Cup a major focus of his first year in office.Not only has Mamdani said that he intends to ask President Donald Trump to reconsider travel bans, but he's also vowed to appoint a “World Cup czar” in an attempt to lower ticket prices for fans attending games. And when CBS Sports interviewed him on his wisdom of the game, he surpassed expectations with deep-cut references to famous African soccer icons. Perhaps we shouldn't have expected anything less from the guy who grew up playing soccer on the Upper West Side and who gained the affection of his Brooklyn recreational soccer league teammates before being elected mayor.

Ruben Amorim on the sideline during a Premier League match between Aston Villa and Manchester United

The Ruben Amorim era in Manchester United ended on January 5 in a move that could best be described as “loud quitting.” As the COVID-19 pandemic led to an era in workplace culture in which employees quietly did the bare minimum and tried to reevaluate their work-life balance, Amorim's public callout of the people above him was the equivalent of a dare. He said, “I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United and that is clear” in a press conference on January 4.  

Then, he later added, “I will do my job and every department—the scouting department, the sporting director—needs to do their job.”

He was fired the next day. Amorim took a page out of the Antonio Conte Tottenham playbook of getting yourself fired. The last image fans had of Amorim was him smiling wide and dapping up a member of the paparazzi as he left his home. If his replacement, club favorite Michael Carrick, can keep the vibes high at United, Amorim won't be the only one cheesing in Manchester.

The finances involved in modern soccer continue to rise exponentially, reaching unprecedented levels with each passing season. 

While there is significant money to be made across the globe, Europe remains the primary battleground for the game's financial powerhouses. In particular, the continent's five leading divisions—the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga and Ligue 1—possess the bulk of commercial heavyweights. 

The 29th edition of Deloitte's Football Money League underscores Europe's economic influence, detailing the world's wealthiest clubs according to revenue earned from matchday, broadcast and commercial streams across the 2024–25 campaign. 

With that in mind, here are the 20 clubs with the highest total revenue across last season. 

There are a few surprising names in the top 20, chiefly West Ham United ($322.8 million) given their continued struggles on the pitch. While their revenue dropped by 14% between the 2023–24 campaign and last season, they have snuck into the rankings ahead of Premier League rivals Brighton & Hove Albion, Everton, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth—all of whom feature between 25th and 21st.

The continued domestic revival of VfB Stuttgart ($346.6 million) has seen them re-enter Deloitte's top 20 for the first time since 2009–10, with significant growth down to their appearance in last term's Champions League. They are narrowly ahead of Benfica ($331.8 million), whose appearance at the Club World Cup last summer ensures they are the first representative outside of Europe's big five leagues since 2020–21. 

Significant Saudi investment has helped Newcastle United ($466 million) boost their revenue over recent years and they join West Ham and 14th-place Aston Villa ($526.7 million) as the only English representatives outside of the traditional “Big Six.” The Villans were boosted by their Champions League run to last term's quarterfinals. 

No Italian teams feature in the wealthiest 10 clubs but three do appear in the top 20. Juventus ($469.9 million) are 16th, narrowly ahead of Newcastle and only a little behind Milan ($480.1 million). The Rossoneri's earnings pale in comparison to their bitter rivals and last season's Champions League finalists Inter ($628.9 million). Despite winning Serie A, Napoli don't even feature in the top 30. 

Borussia Dortmund ($621.6 million) sit just behind Inter in 12th place and while they still remain miles off Bundesliga behemoths Bayern Munich in the rankings, they are comfortably Germany's second richest side.

Chelsea dropped to 10th in Deloitte's Football Money League for 2023–24 and they are unmoved in the rankings based on last season's numbers. They enjoyed a 7% rise in revenue, with their matchday and broadcast earnings increasing despite a reduction in takings from commercial partnerships.Chelsea's Club World Cup success did help offset a season without Champions League football, but their return to Europe's premier competition this term should allow for growth come next year's rankings.

Much like their London rivals Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur have neither ascended nor descended the standings. They have held their position of ninth despite not featuring in last season's Champions League or Club World Cup, although Europa League success will be crucial to an even greater revenue in 2025–26.Tottenham's 9% increase is mainly down to commercial growth and matchday earnings, with their broadcast revenue actually decreasing due to their absence from Europe's most prestigious competition.  

Manchester United's disastrous on-field performances are affecting their earning potential off the pitch. The Red Devils have slipped all the way down to eighth from their position of fourth just last year, although their revenue did increase by three percent despite a reduction in broadcast money. 2024–25 marks United's lowest-ever finish in the Football Money League and given they are without European football of any description this season, things are unlikely to improve significantly in the near future. Defeat in the Europa League final to Spurs will have an enormous financial impact.

Arsenal may be unmoved in the rankings, still sat in seventh place, but they enjoyed a fruitful season from a financial perspective. Their 15% revenue increase saw a significant rise in money taken through matchday, broadcasting and commercial streams, with over $100 million more in the bank compared to 2023–24. The Gunners are still capable of winning the quadruple this season and will reap the financial benefits of any silverware secured—especially in the Premier League and Champions League. Mikel Arteta's side will expect another sizeable increase come the end of the current campaign. 

Manchester City are the only side in the top 10 to have seen a loss of revenue last season. While only a minor 1% reduction in earnings, the underwhelming performances of the Cityzens on the pitch has seen them drop from second in the standings all the way down to sixth. Pep Guardiola's side finished the season without major silverware, coming third in the Premier League, losing in the Champions League playoff round and failing to clinch either domestic cup competition—not that the FA Cup or Carabao Cup have a significant impact on earnings. 

For the first time in Deloitte Football Money League history, Liverpool are England's highest earners. A return to the Champions League and Premier League glory was instrumental to their 17% revenue increase, with an impressive 34% rise in broadcast earnings from the previous campaign. The Reds have climbed three positions in the rankings following a hugely impressive debut season under Arne Slot, although that hard work will be undone should Liverpool fail to qualify for next season's Champions League. 

Despite winning the Champions League and reaching the Club World Cup final, Paris Saint-Germain have actually fallen down the table. Moving from third to fourth, the French giants still posted a 4% revenue increase—largely down to increased broadcasting money. PSG's commercial revenue was actually at its lowest since the 2020–21 season, potentially due to the departures of superstars such as Neymar Jr, Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi in recent years, but their commercial earnings are still enormous. 

Bayern Munich's Bundesliga success, Champions League quarterfinal run and appearance at the Club World Cup resulted in a revenue increase of 12% in 2024–25. Earnings increased across the board and helped the German giants rise from fifth to third in standings.   Bayern are on course for another tremendous campaign under Vincent Kompany, almost certain to win the Bundesliga title and among the favorites for the Champions League crown come the season's conclusion.

Barcelona are back in the top three for the first time since 2019–20, rising four places from last year's standings. The introduction of Personal Seat License arrangements for a one-off earning of just over $80 million helped the Catalans boost revenue by a whopping 27% from the 2023–24 season. Camp Nou's re-opening and eventual completion will only continue to boost matchday revenue in 2025–26, while La Liga success and an impressive European run will also allow Barça the chance to hold their place on the Football Money League podium.

Surprise, surprise. Real Madrid are the highest revenue earners once again. Madrid are the only club to have earned over €1 billion ($1.36 billion) in total revenue, with their 23% increase in commercial revenue offsetting their decrease in matchday revenue—the latter down to the fact that Madrid earned a fortune from Personal Seat License arrangements in 2023–24. The commercial increase has been funded by “improved merchandise performance and new commercial partners”, while there was also a steady increase in broadcast earnings. Overall, Madrid's revenue went up by 11% in 2024–25.

The 39-year-old has penned a short-term contract with the Gelsenkirchen club, to run until the end of the campaign, having left Fiorentina after just half a season.

It marks a return to German football for Dzeko, who made 142 appearances and scored 85 goals for Wolfsburg between 2007 and 2011.

Dzeko then joined Manchester City in January 2011, going on to score 72 goals in 189 outings for the club, winning two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and one EFL Cup.

He left for Roma – initially on loan – in 2015 and enjoyed his most prolific years in Italy, playing 260 times and scoring 119 times for the Giallorossi before switching to Inter, who he helped reach the Champions League final in 2023.

The Bosnia-Herzegovina icon, who is his country's all-time leading scorer with 72 goals in 146 caps, joins a side atop of German football's second tier, four points clear of Elversberg.

Schalke were Champions League semi-finalists as recently as 2011 but have been out of the Bundesliga since 2023, when they suffered their second relegation in three years. 

They almost dropped to the third tier last season, before turning things around under head coach Miron Muslic, who joined from Plymouth Argyle last May.

Champions

League Returns

Dominik Szoboszlai celebrates scoring a free kick against Marseille Justin Setterfield/Getty Images

Let us imagine that Liverpool only play Champions League football and we're analysing one of the most impressive set-piece records in Europe.

Their former set-piece coach, Aaron Briggs, still has a job in this universe and is the theme of this article.

He's just told Dominik Szoboszlai to hit the ball under the wall because Marseille set up without a ‘draught excluder' (the designated player who rather awkwardly lies down behind the barrier formed by his standing team-mates, precisely to stop such shots) and the ensuing goal that sets Liverpool on their way to a 3-0 away win also puts them top of the prestigious ‘set-piece balance' table.

With such a brilliant attacking record in his favour, Briggs is heading towards the type of celebrity status associated with Arsenal's Nicolas Jover and Austin MacPhee at Aston Villa — the leading lights of set-piece coaching — and Liverpool are feared not only for their technical brilliance, but their ability to add goals from dangerous dead-ball situations.

OK, back to reality now and, of course, only some of the above can be talked about with sincerity. Briggs no longer works for Liverpool, and part of the reason for his exit last month was that performance across his department was not good enough in competitions other than the Champions League.

Liverpool do have the best set-piece record in Europe's elite competition this season, though, having now scored six goals (five of which came when Briggs was at the club) without conceding any. Only Chelsea and Arsenal can match that defensive output in the Champions League, which begs the question: why have Liverpool been so bad in these same situations in the Premier League?

The general feeling is they have been dreadful at defending corners, free kicks and throw-ins in the domestic game, while also struggling to offer much creativity from those same routes at the other end of the pitch. Yet while that is accurate when assessing the minus-11 balance in the Premier League (13 conceded, two scored), they have actually been brilliant in Europe and are the 36-team Champions League's top scorers from dead-ball deliveries, with different players stepping up when required.

Against Atletico Madrid in September's league-phase opener, both Andy Robertson and Virgil van Dijk converted from set pieces in a 3-2 win, Van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate did likewise in the following month's 5-1 rout of Eintracht Frankfurt. Alexis Mac Allister also superbly headed in a ball from Szoboszlai to help see off Real Madrid 1-0 in November.

That body of work would usually be celebrated. Perhaps if Liverpool go on to win the Champions League this season, it will be.

The topic of set pieces has irritated supporters so much that they're fed up of hearing about it, and The Athletic has already looked into some of the deeper issues, so with all that in mind, it was particularly interesting to see the impact Szoboszlai's goal had on proceedings at Stade Velodrome on Wednesday, where Arne Slot's side might just have kickstarted their year.

Besides the strike being as cheeky and innovative as it was pre-planned, it was also crucial to the game's outcome. At the point before Szoboszlai converted just before half-time, there was nothing to split the teams as Marseille mixed defensive solidity with attacking enterprise and Liverpool, aside from a few openings, were struggling to find a killer touch.

Speaking after the game to its UK broadcaster TNT Sports, Szoboszlai said: “I did my homework. I got told that if nobody is lying down, then maybe I can have a chance to hit it under the wall, and as no one was lying down, I tried it and, yeah, it worked out.“

After a penalty miss against Burnley in the previous game, this felt like redemption for the Hungarian, who was keen to make a mark on the game.

A few months ago — in the Premier League at least — this would have been the type of encounter that went against Liverpool, most likely through conceding from a set piece with the game otherwise evenly poised.

But having conceded the night's first goal, Marseille had to open themselves up and that allowed Liverpool the freedom to create more chances and ultimately see the game off.

After such a convincing away win against opponents with an impressive home record, there is a genuine belief for the first time in this 13-game unbeaten run across three competitions that this team are on the right track after that dismal nine-defeats-in-12 autumn. The number of chances created is a huge positive — even if their previous match against Burnley, a 1-1 draw at Anfield with the side second bottom of the league, did not go to plan — and the way Liverpool were able to grind Marseille down while staying tight at the back was pleasing.

So much has happened in Slot's second season at the club, starting with the tragic loss of Diogo Jota in the summer, the huge changes in the squad over the following couple of months and then the surrendering of the Premier League title, that it's difficult to enjoy the good times in isolation because so much still needs to be fixed.

But this night in southern France was a reminder of what Liverpool are about.

The advantage of being on the right side of set pieces was huge on this occasion, too, and now they need to take this momentum into the Premier League.

World Cup

 Jim Watson / AFP via Getty Images

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has admitted that many of the people who have applied for tickets for the 2026 World Cup will try to sell them for profit on resale platforms.

Last week, FIFA announced it received more than 500 million requests for tickets — with each request being an application for one to four seats at a specific game — during the month-long sales window, which has just closed.

For FIFA and Infantino, this demand for tickets was the perfect riposte to the criticism they have received for their ticketing polices this summer, most notably the record high prices.

“We had over 500 million ticket requests — half a billion ticket requests,” Infantino said, speaking at a World Cup-themed session of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos on Thursday

“And the tickets are not cheap. We were hammered — I was hammered, I should say — because of the ticket prices, because they are so expensive.

“The main critics were from Germany and England, of course. Now, number one in ticket requests is U.S., number two Germany and number three England. Because everyone wants to come and to participate.”

The German and English markets, however, were not second only to the U.S., as FIFA has already explained that applications from all three co-hosts — Canada, Mexico and the U.S. — beat those from anywhere else.

Infantino went on to talk about the use of resale sites, a point that may raise questions around the world, particularly in countries where the reselling of tickets is either banned or strictly controlled.

“In the U.S., it is perfectly legal to resell tickets on resale platforms — there is a law for that, so we have to allow (it),” he explained.

“So, you can be sure that these tickets, for which we'll have to make a draw because every game will be sold out, will probably be resold at even higher prices. And this is incredible but it shows really the impact that (the World Cup) has.”

FIFA has denied suggestions that many of the 500 million requests have come from automated bots, stating that every request was “validated by unique credit card data”.

Regardless of whether the reseller is real or not, FIFA stands to profit, as it will be charging 15 per cent commissions on both the seller and buyer of any ticket on its own resale platform. This means it will make $30 from the sale of a $100 ticket, although there will not be many priced that cheaply.

This is a significant increase on the fees it has charged in previous tournaments but Infantino has justified FIFA's pricing decisions by saying they are normal for the host market. Furthermore, he believes if FIFA did not price things with the American consumer in mind, it would be handing money over to private companies with no interest in funding football development projects.

Resale platforms are an integral part of the U.S. sports and entertainment scene, with American fans used to dynamic pricing, where the cost of tickets can rise and fall based on demand, and tolerant of high prices for premium events.

However, FIFA set the prices for this tournament and will keep all the profits from ticket sales. And while the vast majority of that money will be shared with its 211 member associations, this expanded World Cup is already guaranteed to make record profits even without the unprecedented increase in ticket prices.

“To give you another number to compare this,” Infantino continued. “In 100 years of World Cup history… FIFA has sold around 50 million tickets in total. Now, for this World Cup, in four weeks, we've had a request for 1,000 years of World Cups at once.

“It's unique, it's incredible. It shows that people have trust in the organisation, probably trust in FIFA as well, trust in Canada, Mexico and the United States. They want to travel, they want to go, want to feel, want to be together.

“We'll see ticket requests from all 211 countries, from all over the world, and those persons who purchase tickets will have what we call — what we agreed with the American administration — a FIFA PASS so they can go to get their visa in a fast-track process.

“So, all those things we read are not true when it comes to the World Cup, because America, and when I speak about America, I speak about Canada, Mexico and the United States, will welcome the world next summer, and this is what we're looking forward to.

“It will be the greatest celebration of humanity. The greatest not just sports event, but the greatest show that our planet has ever seen and probably will ever see.”

Questions remain over whether fans from some participating countries will be allowed to attend, as the U.S. government's crackdown on immigration has seen Haiti, Iran, Ivory Coast and Senegal added to its banned list. The PASS scheme only gives a ticket-holder priority access to an appointment for a visa application. The high cost of accommodation, food and travel in the U.S., which is hosting 78 of the 104 games, remains another barrier to supporters.

The calendar has shifted to 2026, meaning the FIFA World Cup is now just around the corner.

The tournament will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada this summer, running from June 11 to July 19.

Mexico will have the honor of kicking off the World Cup on June 11 when it hosts South Africa at the Estadio Azteca. Canada and the United States will begin their World Cup journeys the following day.

This will be the first World Cup to feature 48 teams, a major expansion from the 32 nations that competed in the 2022 World Cup. The teams will be divided into 12 groups of four nations each.

The top two teams in each group – and the eight best third-place finishers – advance to knockout stage, which begins on June 28 with the Round of 32.

The round of 16 begins July 4, the quarterfinals on July 9 and semifinals take place July 14-15, leading up to the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey on July 19.

Barcelona have confirmed influential midfielder Pedri is set to be ruled out of action for around a month after he was forced out of a Champions League clash with Slavia Prague. Boss Hansi Flick delivered a worrying update after the game on the Spain international, who completed just over an hour of that continental contest before picking up an injury. His manager admitted “it is not good news” on the fitness front, with the La Liga leaders now without one of their most important players.

Pedri played his part in a topsy-turvy encounter that took place on a freezing night in the Czech capital. He saw Barca fall behind early on, before Fermin Lopez turned the tie on its head when netting twice in the space of eight first-half minutes.

The game was all square at the interval as Polish striker Robert Lewandowski put through his own net. Pedri, who had been pulling strings in the middle of the park, had to be replaced by Dani Olmo in the 61st minute.

Barca took the lead again less than two minutes later, as Olmo made an immediate impact, before 37-year-old frontman Lewandowski cancelled out his earlier own goal and opened his European account for 2025-26.

Speaking about Pedri's condition after his withdrawal, Flick admitted the outlook appeared bleak. He told reporters when asked for an update on the 23-year-old playmaker: “I don't know what he has exactly, but it's the hamstring. It is what it is. Sometimes these things happen. I don't know how long he will be out. It's not good news. We will see [on Thursday].”

Pedri endured a number of injury struggles early on at Barca, with muscular problems proving difficult to shake. He has largely steered clear of the treatment table on a regular basis during Flick's time at the helm. Hamstring issues are not uncommon, though, with five games sat out in October with an ailment of that kind, before missing one in December with a calf complaint. 

In a statement released later on Thursday, Barcelona confirmed the damage: ""The tests carried out this morning have confirmed that Pedri has suffered a muscle injury in the biceps femoris of his right leg, which he sustained during the match against Slavia Prague. The expected recovery time is one month.""

Barca did fare admirably without him against Slavia Prague, with Fermin Lopez impressing again after previously registering a Champions League hat-trick against Olympiacos back in October - with the 22-year-old breaking into double figures for goals across all competitions this season.

Flick was full of praise for the Masia academy graduate, saying: “Fermin is a fantastic player. It was important for him and the club that he stayed here last summer because he came through at Barcelona, he lives for Barca. I appreciate a lot what I saw today.”

Barca have moved up to ninth in the Champions League table, with the top eight qualifying automatically for the last 16. They have one game left in which to break into that pack, with FC Copenhagen travelling to Camp Nou on January 28.

Flick is eager to see his side prevail in that contest, with the expectation being that victory will ensure that the Blaugrana remain upwardly mobile and avoid the need for a play-off fixture to keep their continental dreams alive.

Flick said: “It won't be easy to beat Copenhagen. We don't know if Ferran [Torres] will be back, maybe Pedri won't play now, Frenkie [de Jong] will be suspended. But we will get Lamine [Yamal] back, it's true, and we have a good opportunity to make the top eight. We didn't start the Champions League well, but with one game left, we have a chance to be where we want to be still.”

Teenage wonderkid Yamal sat out Barca's win over Slavia through suspension, having picked up three yellow cards in Champions League action this season. He should be handed an immediate recall for a home date with Real Oviedo on Sunday.

Barcelona head into that contest sat top of the Liga standings, but with Clasico rivals Real Madrid now just one point off the pace. Flick's men suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Real Sociedad in their last domestic outing, meaning that they are now looking anxiously over their shoulder.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka headlines another scorching day Down Under, while Coco Gauff, Jasmine Paolini and Mirra Andreeva also look for a spot in the second week.

The 16 players competing in Friday's WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz third-round matches from the top half of the draw will be feeling the heat.

The forecast at Melbourne Park is for a sizzling 40 degrees Celsius -- 104 degrees Fahrenheit. But there's the palpable pressure, too, of attempting to advance to the second week of a Grand Slam.

It's a milestone for many players, like qualifier Zeynep Sonmez of Turkey. This is the sixth career major for the No. 112-ranked player, and she's never gotten past the third round. Same for No. 79 Elena-Gabriela Ruse, playing her 15th career Grand Slam. This is Hailey Baptiste's seventh season of playing Slams and it would mean the world to her if she could replicate last year's fourth-round appearance at Roland Garros. 

For the top seeds, it's a borderline professional necessity. No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, No. 3 Coco Gauff, No. 7 Jasmine Paolini and No. 8 Mirra Andreeva all expect to win.

Let's break down those eight matches, the first card of this Australian Open that features seeded players on opposite sides of the court.

No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka vs. Anastasia Potapova

Head-to-head: 2-0 Sabalenka, 2023 Stuttgart SF (6-1, 6-2), 2025 Rome Rd2 (6-2, 6-2).

This is a meeting of good friends, but it's hard to ignore the roll Sabalenka's on here. She's won 45 of her past 50 sets -- numbers that put her in the exalted company of players named Graf, Hingis, Seles and Serena.

“That sounds crazy and surreal, to be honest,” Sabalenka told reporters. “Just never thought that people will compare me to these names, even though I'm really far away from their achievements.

On to the next round!😘@SabalenkaA | #AO26 pic.twitter.com/E3RzTgBMrH

“It motivates me to keep doing my thing. It just means for me that I'm on the right way.”

Sabalenka, a two-time champion in Melbourne and aiming for her fourth straight final, has dropped only nine games in two previous matches.

Potapova, 24 and now representing Austria, handled Emma Raducanu 7-6 (3), 6-2 in the second round. She's played on the court at Rod Laver Arena twice before, losing to Serena Williams both times.

“I have nothing to lose,” Potapova said. “I tried my best. I have a broken finger. I'm still enjoying tennis. Yeah, will just try to go there and make the best out of it.”

No. 3 Coco Gauff vs. Hailey Baptiste

Head-to-head: 1-0 Gauff, 2023 Washington, D.C.

Another friendly matchup between these fellow Americans.

“I'm really excited to play her,” Gauff said. “I have known her for so long. It's always great to see people you come up with do well on the tour and be able to face them in these big matches. Last time I played her was a while ago. We have both gotten better since then, so it will be a different matchup.

Gauff has won five of six matches to start the year and, like Sabalenka, has dropped only nine games. Baptiste dispatched Aussie favorite Storm Hunter 6-2, 6-1 to get here.

“Obviously she's at the top of the game right now,” Baptiste said of Gauff. “It's really exciting for me to be able to play somebody like that and take my shot.

“I feel like I've been able to just control my nerves a bit better the last year or so I've gotten to the second week of a Slam, so now I'm trying to just push beyond that every time I get into these events.”

No. 7 Jasmine Paolini vs. No. 29 Iva Jovic

Head-to-head: 2-0 Paolini, 2025 Indian Wells, 2025 US Open

One year ago, ranked at No. 191, Jovic lost in the second round here to Elena Rybakina. The 18-year-old is seeded for the first time in a Grand Slam.

“It's really nice just to achieve the goal,” Jovic said. “It's really nice to not have to be so nervous when the draw's coming out. You're like, `Oh my God, I could kind of just played the 1 seed first round.' 

“For this one I was like, `I'll see it later, it's OK, it's not going to be horrifying either way.”

After routine wins over Katie Volynets and wildcard Priscilla Hon (eight games dropped), Jovic faces the uncomfortable prospect of playing Paolini. Paolini's lost only eight games, too, and enjoys that head-to-head advantage.

No. 8 Mirra Andreeva vs. Elena-Gabriela Ruse

Head-to-head: 0-0

Andreeva, also 18, played a terrific second-round match, beating Maria Sakkari 6-0, 6-4 before a raucous pro-Greek crowd.

“Obviously they were loud,” said Andreeva, now 8-1 in 2026. “When she won those three games in a row, I think she won 11 or 12 points in a row, they really went for it. I really tried to keep all my focus into the match, not thinking about how loud they are cheering.

“Now as I'm learning that this is going to happen almost every tournament that I'm going to go, there are going to be a lot of fans cheering for one or the other player, it's something that I have to learn how to deal with.”

Ruse has been impressive, upsetting No. 24 seed Dayana Yastremska and Aussie Ajla Tomljanovic.

No. 12 Elina Svitolina vs. No. 23 Diana Shnaider

Head-to-head: 0-0

Svitolina wrapped up her 2025 season in September and she's seeing the benefits with a 7-0 start to the new year.

“For me, it was important to just step back,” Svitolina explained. “Of course, I was sad that I didn't give myself a chance to get maybe in the Finals or maybe get back in Top 10, but this was the right choice.

“I can see now that I'm more refreshed.”

Shnaider, meanwhile, saved three match points against fired-up Australian wild card Talia Gibson (and her fans), overcoming a 2-0 deficit in the third set.

The smile says it all 😀Diana Shnaider is through to another third round at the Australian Open 👌#AO26pic.twitter.com/1diILFb44N

No. 17 Victoria Mboko vs. No. 14 Clara Tauson

Head-to-head: 0-0

In terms of seeding, this is the closest match -- and, appropriately, these two employ gripping power games and have traced similar early trajectories.

Tauson was a teenage champion in 2021, taking titles in Lyon and Luxembourg. Mboko made a huge splash last year, winning the WTA 1000 in Montreal and, later, taking the title in Hong Kong.

Mboko took out Caty McNally 6-4, 6-3 in the second round, while Tauson was extended to three sets by qualifier Polina Kudermetova.

No. 19 Karolina Muchova vs. Magda Linette

Head-to-head: 3-1 Muchova, having won the past three -- 2024 Eastbourne, 2020 Doha and 2019 Seoul

Muchova's won five of six matches to start the year, but was pressed while beating Alycia Parks 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.

“Karolina obviously so talented,” Linette said. “Can do everything at all times. You never know really what to expect. She can be a player that can really lead the game, but on the other side, she can also get a little bit more nervous.

“So for me it will be crucial to stay calm and keep pressing her.”

Linette upset No. 15 seed Emma Navarro in the first round and took out Ann Li in the second.

Yulia Putintseva vs. Zeynep Sonmez

Head-to-head: 0-0

Sonmez, a 23-year-old from Turkey, has already won, including qualifying, five matches here.

“It definitely helped me to play three matches in qualies, because I got used to courts, weather and everything,” she said. “As I played, I started to feel better on the court with my shots and everything. I don't feel tired. I feel like I'm getting used to it more and more.”

Sonmez, enjoying great support from Turkish fans, defeated Anna Bondar 6-2, 6-4.

“I know that it's a new thing in Turkey, but I don't want to stop here. I want to keep going. I want to do better things.”

Putintseva, 31, representing Kazakhstan, has been a Top 100 player since 2014. She dispatched Elsa Jacquemot 6-1, 6-2.

Stella explains McLaren approach to 2026 with every team starting ‘from zero' 

Temple details McLaren preparations ahead of new 2026 regulations

2025 F1 ACADEMY champion Doriane Pin discusses taking the title after a relentless battle through the year, being part of the Mercedes family and what comes next.

For Doriane Pin there has only been one target at the forefront of her mind – to win. That's a lofty ambition for even the greatest of drivers, but it's precisely that relentless pursuit that fuelled the 22-year-old on her way to becoming the 2025 F1 ACADEMY Champion.

Never one to blend in, Pin was destined to stand out from the moment she first set foot in a kart aged seven. Too small to race initially, she soon began to break the racing driver mould. As her nickname of ‘Pocket Rocket' attests to, Pin was a driver you should never underestimate.

Opting to go down the sportscar route, the French racer was the first woman to win the FIA World Endurance Championship's Revelation of the Year Award and her destiny seemed set in endurance. However, when Mercedes offered her the chance to represent them in F1 ACADEMY, it was a chance she was determined to repay with the title.

“Champion is a beautiful word to really fit our season,” she summarises. “We can be really proud of all the work we have done since last year. We never gave up, we worked so hard on winning races, winning the title.

“Since the very first time I got in a go-kart, I wanted to win every single race I competed in. I'm very happy about my entire journey, and obviously my journey with F1 ACADEMY has been unforgettable. I'm very proud of all of this, and now we can celebrate it.""

Storming onto the scene with victory on her F1 ACADEMY debut in Jeddah, Pin had every intention of claiming the 2024 crown with PREMA Racing. However, she found she'd met her match in Abbi Pulling. The Briton dominated the season and, despite Pin's valiant efforts, Pulling sealed the title by 121 points.

Entering the 2025 F1 season, it was clear that Pin had unfinished business to take care of. As a title favourite, the weight of expectation fell heavy on her shoulders. Her competition was no less fierce, as Ferrari junior Maya Weug went back-and-forth with Pin for the top spot.

“Obviously it's amazing to battle with an experienced driver, with someone who knows how to race,” she replies when asked about her season-long duel with Weug.

“She's talented and very much deserves her success this year. It was a close battle that I actually enjoyed a lot, because you need those drivers to push you and push each other to the top. We did exactly that so it was really positive.”

Taking the Standings lead with a daring first lap pass on Weug in Shanghai Race 2, Pin lost the top spot one round later, a position she refused to accept. Recognising that she needed to step up her game, the Mercedes junior left no stone unturned as she drove herself to be better than ever.

Claiming four wins and four further podiums, she finished outside the top five on just one occasion and sealed the title in the final race by 15 points. Her impeccable consistency was built on rapid speed and a sharp intellect, choosing her moments wisely – not least her outstanding performance going from sixth to the victory in Miami Race 1. However, Pin's ambitions would never be content with anything less than the top step of the podium.

“When you're not winning, it's challenging because you doubt yourself,” she admits. “You always put yourself first to know what you could do better, what you could improve, what you could do next time.

""Zandvoort was a good example. It was not easy at all but we were still there performing on Sunday. Keep working hard and never give up. The work you're doing always pays off.”

Even her behaviour behind the scenes takes lessons from those that have gone before her, with her journal recording car and session details reminiscent of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel.

The change in Pin across her two seasons isn't stark, with her virtually unshakeable mentality ever present. Yet there's something more refined in her approach, a humble yet firm self-assurance that becomes apparent on-track.

“Just being in the present,” Pin responds when asked about her mentality last season. “Winning and fighting for a title for the whole year hasn't been easy because when you're leading, you're the one to beat. You're the one that has to be there all the time.

“We have been very good all year, especially the last weekend in Vegas – we've been spot on from FP1 to the last lap of the race. We prepare well, we have the right mindset and it's definitely the right way to approach things when you're focusing on yourself and being in the moment.""

She adds: “We're champions and it's about how intelligent you are sometimes and your approach. I'm very happy about this weekend especially, because we have been very ahead of our contenders in terms of approach. It's clearly making a difference because we are champions.”

On hand to celebrate the title with her in Las Vegas were Mercedes, as the Formula 1 team poured into parc ferme wearing custom ‘P1N' shirts. George Russell, Kimi Antonelli and Toto Wolff were amongst the first to congratulate her and the Team Principal was full of praise for their young star.

“Dori has been a great addition to the team,” he remarked in the Mercedes End of Year Review video. “Her background was a little bit different because she came through karting and then more from touring cars and GT cars, and some very good performances in prototypes.

""But then she went into [F1 ACADEMY] and crushed it. She won the championship. She's a fierce young lady that can drive. From a personality, she fits into Mercedes, she fits into the team and it's a pleasure to see her working.""

Her place at the heart of the Mercedes family saw her sit down with Russell for some advice ahead of her debut in Montreal – both would take to the top step across the Canadian Grand Prix weekend – alongside joining the garage for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

“Mercedes have been there from day one,” she says. “They are incredibly supportive of me every day, from bad days to good days. They bring professionalism, experience and performance into my racing career. It's beautiful to achieve that together. Celebrating with them was a beautiful moment. I will remember it for my entire life.”

As the next stage awaits, with duties as a Mercedes Development Driver soon to come for the 22-year-old, Pin's aspirations know no bounds. With a versatility that should stand her in good stead for any path she chooses, the opportunities are endless. Savouring all she's learnt across her two seasons in F1 ACADEMY, her childhood dream is as alive as ever.

“I've definitely grown a lot as a person because you're in such an incredible world,” says Pin. ""Every day you learn something so it's super fascinating when you're passionate about motorsport and the high level of sport.

""I've learned so much in terms of driving, but also outside the track and on myself as well. I'm really proud of everything I learned because I know it's a privilege and I know it's going to be very helpful for the rest of my career.""

She adds: “The idea is to have a long and successful career. Hopefully we will achieve good things with everyone who is involved at the moment with me […] I've grown so much, it will definitely help me in my entire career.

""F1 ACADEMY and everything around it is big and I will never give up on achieving my ultimate goal – that's Formula 1.”

Stella explains McLaren approach to 2026 with every team starting ‘from zero' 

Temple details McLaren preparations ahead of new 2026 regulations

Following Audi's launch of their 2026 car, Gabriel Bortoleto has given his take on the mood in the camp and his hopes for the season ahead.

Gabriel Bortoleto has shared an insight into the “emotional” reaction of the Audi team when the squad's 2026 car hit the track for the first time, with the Brazilian admitting that there were “a lot of tears in the eyes” – including his – during the shakedown.

Ahead of the outfit's first year under the Audi name – following their transition from the former Kick Sauber team – the R26 was unveiled as part of an immersive launch event in Berlin on Tuesday, as Bortoleto joined team mate Nico Hulkenberg, Team Principal Jonathan Wheatley and Head of Audi F1 project Mattia Binotto to reveal the new challenger.

It marked the latest milestone in the team's journey, with the car having made its maiden appearance on track for a shakedown at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on January 9, two days after the squad confirmed their first successful fire-up.

When asked during the launch event to sum up his emotions about being one of Audi's lead drivers, Bortoleto reflected: “It's an amazing opportunity in my career. Obviously when I entered F1 I knew about the project and I was very involved in it.

“But finally to start it and be part of this – to be here today launching the car and head to the track in one week's time – it's going to be incredible. I'm very proud of the team for everything they have done so far. You know, hard work to put all of this together that we are making and the history we are also creating.”

In terms of how it felt to test the R26 just a few days into the New Year, Bortoleto summarised: “It was great. It was great to feel a little bit the new regulation car, the engine, the power unit style that is going to be quite different from last year.

“But honestly I'm looking forward to it and to testing it properly in a proper day – with proper days in Barcelona and Bahrain – test things, experience things and then extract all of it.”

The 21-year-old admitted that there is much excitement in the team and at the squad's headquarters ahead of the new campaign, resulting in an emotional moment for many when the car hit the track for the first time.

“The mood is great, everyone is so excited about it,” said Bortoleto. “I feel like everyone has been working so, so hard that no one had time to stop and realise everything that has been built and everything we are doing.

“When we saw the car going out for the first time in the shakedown and everyone – you could see a lot of tears in the eyes because people were getting emotional about the project and what to expect of it. I was one of them if I'm honest! It's just great.”

With new technical regulations coming into effect in 2026, Bortoleto is expecting a challenge but also believes that the rules reset will become second nature in time.

“It's going to be more for sure in terms of we need to study a little bit more the new regulations and what to do on that,” he explained. “But at some point it's going to get automatic as much as it was last year. I believe at the beginning everything will be new for everyone.

“We don't really know how to manage this or that, but everyone will get used to it at some point and it will be just another regulation change.”

And when asked what would constitute a good year, the Audi driver responded: “I don't want to put a result on it because I had the same question last year and I said exactly the same thing.

“I just want to see progress – progress with the team, I want to see us developing through the year, improving the car, improving ourselves as drivers as well. If we're able to do this I'm sure the results will come as a consequence of this so I'm happy with that.”

Stella explains McLaren approach to 2026 with every team starting ‘from zero' 

Temple details McLaren preparations ahead of new 2026 regulations

F1 drivers are among the fittest athletes in the world, requiring exceptional strength, endurance, and mental resilience to perform at mind blowing speeds.

January is synonymous with fresh starts, but even more so getting back into routine after a well-earned rest period, and F1 drivers are no different.

The drivers have been making the most of the winter break so far, whether it's Alex Albon unwinding on the water, George Russell hitting the slopes with family, or Lewis Hamilton soaking up the energy of New York, but all attention now turns towards the 2026 season.

For most of us, getting into shape means a renewed focus on eating well and fitting in regular exercise. For F1 drivers, however, the process is far more complex. Peak physical conditioning is just the starting point. Drivers must prepare their bodies to withstand intense g-forces, maintain a finely balanced racing weight, and keep their reactions lightning fast. Not to forget they must manage all this all while keeping mental wellbeing, recovery and sleep firmly in check.

It's a relentless routine for each driver, and one that underlines just how demanding life at the pinnacle of motorsport really is. Let's take a look at some of the ways F1 drivers train for the season, and whether we can take any inspiration for our own fitness goals.

Whereas most elite athletes train to improve their performance, F1 drivers also train to cope with some of the most extreme physical forces in sport. Under heavy braking, drivers can apply up to around 160kg of force to the pedal while experiencing up to 6g on their body – meaning they are subjected to forces around six times their body weight. Without specific training and conditioning, the strain placed on their neck, core, and upper body would quickly become unmanageable (at best!) over the course of an arduous race.

Through high-speed corners, drivers are regularly exposed to sustained forces of around 4-5g, with peaks approaching a whopping 6g at certain circuits. At Mugello in 2020, for example, Lewis Hamilton recorded a peak of 5.6g through Turn 7, which is even higher than the forces astronauts experience during rocket launches! Managing these pressures places a significant demand on the body and requires careful conditioning to be able to handle.

However, drivers need to both prepare for racing conditions and extreme incidents – however rare they may be. Accidents such as Robert Kubica's crash at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, which registered forces of up to 75g, and Romain Grosjean's Bahrain crash in 2020, measured at 67g, highlight why physical conditioning combined with improved safety systems and medical protocols remains a central part of racing.

After the long winter break, the first day back at work is assessment day. Winding down over winter is crucial to keep the drivers from burning out during the season, but the first day back can be a gruelling one – with Lando Norris calling it ""probably the worst day of the year"" and ""a gruesome day of training.""

His trainer, John Malvern, puts him through a myriad of tests to identify strengths and weaknesses – addressing anything that could cost Norris' lap time.

There is one part of the body that F1 drivers need to train more than any other sport – the neck. Strengthening the neck is so critical that they work it out almost every day, with Malvern saying Norris does neck training at least five times a week.

Why is it so important? F1 drivers hit speeds exceeding 180mph, and during high-speed corners and braking, the g-forces directly push onto their necks, putting them under immense strain. Without training, drivers' heads would bounce around the cockpit, unable to withstand the strain put on those muscles. Not only must drivers cope with this pressure, but they must get comfortable with it – as they need to remain focussed on driving and having information fed to them through the radio.

Antti Kontsas, former coach to Sebastian Vettel, gives more insight into he importance of a rock-steady neck for the grid. He said: “The real reason why the neck is so important is that you need to see where you're going. It's all about precision. We're talking about hundreds and tenths of a second, and if you don't see exactly where you're going and you cannot navigate well through the track, there's no chance for you to gain that extra hundredth or tenth.”

Through training, F1 drivers can lift up to a staggering 40kg using only their neck muscles achieving this through a variety of innovative if not slightly bizarre exercises. Using resistance bands around your head can imitate g-forces, while drivers also use weighted helmets and specialised neck devices to simulate high-speed corners. Although most of us won't experience the g-forces that drivers do, training your neck is something you could try at home or in the gym – why not try some neck curls and extensions with small weights or resistance bands?

Maintaining an active heart rate is another important part of F1 drivers' training. During a race, their heart rate can exceed 170bpm for a sustained period, so keeping their heart healthy and oxygen flowing is vitally important.

In a scene in F1 The Movie, APXGP driver Joshua Pearce is shown running on a treadmill hooked up to breathing equipment. This is the VO2 max test – one of the ways to monitor drivers' heart and lung capacity, and to measure oxygen delivery to the muscles during training. Essentially, how big your ‘energy tank' is.

But before they jump on the treadmill for the VO2 max test, drivers often perform an even more demanding test: a three-minute all-out run. Not three minutes of fast jogging, but three minutes of sprinting, with the goal being to cover over 900 meters. Anything further is considered ‘outstanding,' but it's no easy feat, as Norris claimed this exercise was as difficult as they come.

The drivers keep up with their cardio year-round, so why not have a go at some of their favourite activities? Carlos Sainz and Valtteri Bottas enjoy scenic cycling to stay fit, Kimi Antonelli is frequently in the pool practicing some strokes, and Charles Leclerc visits the mountains for some cross-country skiing at high altitude.

The global nature of F1 means that drivers must be prepared for all conditions, especially extreme heat. Cockpit temperatures can exceed 60C – any training done to prepare for this could help performance while alleviating some health risks.

Hamilton and Russell have both mentioned the extreme weight loss experienced at races like Singapore, which can sometimes be up to 4kg of water. Losing this much water from your body in less than four hours is highly abnormal and must be taken seriously, so hydration makes up a key part of training regimes.

The body has to withstand an immense amount of heat, so part of Norris' assessment day involves testing his body's response to heat stress. To test his exertion in extreme temperatures, Norris rides a stationary bike, while hooked up to a monitoring apparatus, in a temperature-controlled room to simulate a hot race weekend.

Working out in heat can be useful if done correctly – why not try some warm weather cardio training in summer, some hot yoga classes, or some gentle sauna exercises to work up a sweat?

Getting drivers into shape isn't all about logging hours in the gym and laps on the track – good nutrition is vital for high performance athletes. In 2019 the FIA introduced an 80kg threshold for driver weight, with those weighing less having seat ballast to make up difference. As a result, drivers are able to sustain healthy muscle composition with fewer limitations on their nutritional intake. However, they must still carefully balance caloric intake to meet the demands of their intense training and racing, while maintaining an optimal body weight – and as close to the 80kg as possible.

Speaking to The Paddock Journal, Russell's trainer Aleix Casanovas mentioned how Russell's nutrition is guided by blood tests taken throughout the year, tailored supplements, and constant monitoring of hydration. F1 is about fine margins, so getting the right nutrition is a vital part of preparation all year long.

Norris explained on his YouTube channel how his nutritionist monitors his vitamin and mineral intake to ensure his diet is balanced and working well for him. While most of us won't have a nutritionist to help, it's a good thing to bear in mind as sports and exercise are easier and more enjoyable with proper accompanying subsidence.

Physical health is a non-negotiable for the grid, but the very best drivers put in just as much time managing their mental health to succeed. Lewis Hamilton's relationship with his physio Angela Cullen is a good example of this – with the New Zealander part of his team from 2016 to 2023, and recently rejoining Hamilton at Ferrari. Cullen was also one of the only people in his bubble during the COVID-affected 2020 season, with Hamilton crediting her with much of his success, saying that her positivity and hard work have helped him immensely.

F1 seasons are long and stressful – and without deliberate training and practice, it can be hard to manage the ups and downs that come with racing at the highest level. Having the mental resilience to process information at 200mph, make split-second decisions, and calmly maintain concentration hours is a skill in itself.

Casanovas sees his role with Russell in similar terms – it's about managing the off-track to get the most performance on-track. He said: ""This is the main thing about why we're here in F1 during the weekends: to remind these guys to switch off. Knowing when to rest is as important as knowing when to push.”

It can be hard to simulate the sort of high-pressure scenarios that F1 drivers experience most weekends, but maintaining awareness of both our physical and mental health is something we can all try. How about planning in downtime into your weekly schedule to make sure you don't burn out?

For the drivers, soon after the race concludes they must already be thinking about their recovery plan and the week of training ahead. This is even the case when there is no racing on the schedule – after Norris completes his fitness assessment day, he's completely spent. ""I don't feel great, I'm pretty dead,"" he admits to camera. But there's a long car journey back to McLaren ahead of him, and he needs to ""get rested up and get ready to go again."" That's the reality for the drivers – even periods of rest are strategic!

Sleep hygiene is just as important as training sessions as rest is where the adaptations from hard workouts are made. Casanovas talks to hotels in advance to ensure Russell's room is set up correctly. Russell brings his own pillow and duvet, and there are sleep supplements waiting in his room. ""Little things like this: reminding him to sleep, reminding him to take naps,"" says Casanovas. The key to a successful relationship between the performance coach and the athlete is understanding every detail of their schedule – even when they're having a snooze!

During the off-season, drivers like Valtteri Bottas and Daniel Ricciardo would train six days a week. Ahead of the 2020 season, Daniel Ricciardo's kettlebell routine was shared on social media, and consisted of:

Repeat five (!!) times

Don't be fooled – even though drivers are mostly sitting in cars, it's crucial for them to strengthen and train their entire bodies. Squats for glute strength and stability, and deadlifts for the hamstrings and quads that need to be strong enough to apply 160kg braking force up to 1,200 times per race! Even with power steering, driving at those speeds with that much g-force requires their arms need to be incredibly strong.

Pull-ups, press-ups, and bench presses, all designed to support those highly developed neck muscles and maintain control while being subjected to g-force. One exercise you might recognise from drivers' social media is to improve their core strength: sitting on the floor holding a racing position, rotating a weighted disk clockwise and counterclockwise to mimic steering – although it might look a little odd, it is effective!

With such an intensive exercise schedule fitted around copious amounts of travel and hectic race weekends – maybe we'll leave it to the professionals!

Jacob Elordi just received his first Oscar nomination for his transformational performance as The Creature in Frankenstein. It's one of an impressive nine nods for the Netflix film, with writer-director Guillermo del Toro nominated for his adaptation of the Mary Shelley novel and much of the below-the-line artisans, including del Toro regulars Dan Laustsen (cinematography) and Kate Hawley (costumes), recognized as well. This is to say, many nominated for the movie have been recognized by the Academy before. But Elordi has started a new chapter in his young, auspicious career, as he prepares to topline a studio movie next month in Wuthering Heights opposite Margot Robbie and return for the much-hyped third season of Euphoria.

	“I am beside myself,” Elordi tells The Hollywood Reporter. “I am so excited. I mean, I'm 28 years old. It's wind in the sails.” Below, he takes stock of it all.

I'm not sure where you are in the world, but did you wake up for the nominations? Walk me through the last few hours.


	I was asleep. I fell asleep reading a good book, so I was comfortably asleep. My mother is with me right now, and I heard her phone ring and it woke me from my sleep, and then I heard her feet running up the stairs. She had my whole team on a group FaceTime call. Very, very, very exciting. Very sweet for all of us.

	











You and I have spoken about how close you felt to this character, and how much it pushed you as an actor. What's the significance of the recognition, in the context of that?


	This character for me and what is on screen is everything that I've wanted to say as an actor my whole life. It's every bit of the dream that I've had since I was 12. It's everything that I could possibly express of myself in a part. So in a way, the creature is the personification of a dream I had when I was very small. It means a lot to me because it's not just a character, it's myself. It's myself as an actor, I suppose.


Frankenstein is up for nine Oscars. A lot of your below-the-line colleagues were recognized for their contributions. 


	It's incredibly confirming and it makes me super grateful to the Academy and to the movie industry because it tells me that we are looking at the right things. The same with films like Sinners that are also handmade, it's just incredible actors, incredible artisans being recognized for real handmade cinematic work. It's a good thing for the movies.


What are some of the performances you are excited to be in the conversation with this year?


	Even down to the performances that I'm nominated with — every actor grew up on Sean Penn. I mean, that's the bar in terms of real performance. Then Stellan Skarsgard, Benicio del Toro — these are people that I've read the unofficial biographies of. It's surreal to be in esteemed company.


Guillermo was not nominated for directing despite receiving a lot of recognition along the way. You've become very close. Anything you want to say there?












	I see that our film has nine nominations, and for him particularly adapting the screenplay, something that's so dear and personal to him, I think that is just such an incredible achievement. All of our nominations are his nominations. None of us have these nominations without Guillermo del Toro.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Donald Trump raged at the latest New York Times/Siena Poll, which shows him with low approval after a year in office, and said that he'll add what he called the “fake results” to his defamation claim against the Gray Lady.


	Trump's Truth Social post on Thursday is only the latest threat to target pollsters with legal action. He sued pollster Ann Selzer and the Des Moines Register over a 2024 pre-election poll showing his behind in Iowa, yet he went on to win the state.


	Trump posted on Truth Social, “The Times Siena Poll, which is always tremendously negative to me, especially just before the Election of 2024, where I won in a Landslide, will be added to my lawsuit against The Failing New York Times. Our lawyers have demanded that they keep all Records, and how they “computed” these fake results — Not just the fact that it was heavily skewed toward Democrats. They will be held fully responsible for all of their Radical Left lies and wrongdoing!”

	The Times/Siena Poll, published on Thursday, showed that 49% of those surveyed said that the country was worse off under Trump, versus 32% who said better. His job approval was at 40%, and disapproval at 56%. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Trump sued the Times last year, claiming, among other things, that Susanne Craig and Ross Buettner, and their book Lucky Loser, defamed him. Their article was headlined, “The Star-Making Machine That Created ‘Donald Trump.'” The lawsuit took particular issue with the notion that Trump's celebrity fame was due to Mark Burnett and NBC's The Apprentice. 


	A judge tossed out the lawsuit shortly after it was filed, warning that “a complaint is not a public forum for vituperation and invective — not a protected platform to rage against an adversary.”


	Trump refiled the complaint, citing not just the claim that Burnett made Trump a star, but other passages. His lawsuit cited claims made in the book that Trump received “the equivalent of more than $400 million from his father, much of it through fraudulent tax evasion schemes.”

	











	The Times is challenging the filing of the case in Florida, and not New York, while arguing that Trump's claim “fails to sufficiently allege the most basic element of a defamation claim: a false and defamatory statement of fact. It does not allege, as it must, how each statement in suit is false or what President Trump contends the truth to be, and it challenges statements that are not defamatory.”


	A spokesperson for the Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


	Trump's lawsuit against Selzer and the Register cited an Iowa consumer law. After dismissing the lawsuit in federal court, Trump filed it in state court, a day before a state anti-SLAPP statute took effect. Anti-SLAPP laws are designed to protect defendants from frivolous lawsuits meant to stifle speech. The state lawsuit is still pending.


	A class-action lawsuit over the Selzer poll as dismissed by a federal judge last year. The plaintiffs, the conservative group the Center for American Rights, is appealing.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	Three weeks ago, Timothée Chalamet declared on Instagram that he is “officially unc” as he turned 30. He may be old by Gen Alpha standards, but he is one of the youngest actors ever to become a three-time Oscar nominee for acting.


	All of Chalamet's nominations have come in the Best Actor category, for Call Me by Your Name in 2018, A Complete Unknown last year, and Marty Supreme this morning. He is 30 years and 26 days old. 


	Chalamet is the youngest male actor to accomplish the feat since the great Marlon Brando, who was nominated for A Streetcar Named Desire in 1952, Viva Zapata! in 1953 and Julius Caesar in 1954, also all in the Best Actor category. Brando was still 29 when the 1954 Oscar nominations were revealed on Feb. 15 of that year, a month and a half before his 30th birthday on April 3. 

	











	Overall Jennifer Lawrence remains the youngest actor ever (male or female) to earn three Oscar nominations. She was 23 when she received her third her American Hustle (Supporting Actress) in January 2014, following Best Actress nominations for Winter's Bone (2011) and Silver Linings Playbook (2013), the latter landing her the trophy.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Chalamet is actually a four-time Oscar nominee. He is also nominated in the Best Picture category this year as one of the Marty Supreme producers, becoming the youngest actor to accomplish the acting-producing Oscar nomination double in the same year. He edged Warren Beatty who was 30 years and almost 10 months when he achieved the same in February 1968 for Bonnie and Clyde. 


	In the 2026 Actor In a Leading Role field, Chalamet is facing previous winner Leonardo DiCaprio (One Battle after Another), Ethan Hawke (Blue Moon), Michael B. Jordan (Sinners) and Wagner Moura (The Secret Agent).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Vince Gilligan, R.E.M, 700 other artists sign open letter condemning AI ""theft""","https://www.avclub.com/ai-theft-letter-vince-gilligan-scarlett-johansson","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:49:19 GMT","

As AI invades more creative spaces, whether we ask it to or not, a coalition of actors, musicians, writers, and other artists have shared a new statement with a blunt message: stealing isn't innovation. 

“America's creative community is the envy of the world and creates jobs, economic growth, and exports. But rather than respect and protect this valuable asset, some of the biggest tech companies, many backed by private equity and other funders, are using American creators' work to build AI platforms without authorization or regard for copyright law,” reads the statement. “Artists, writers, and creators of all kinds are banding together with a simple message: Stealing our work is not innovation. It's not progress. It's theft – plain and simple.  A better way exists – through licensing deals and partnerships, some AI companies have taken the responsible, ethical route to obtaining the content and materials they wish to use. It is possible to have it all. We can have advanced, rapidly developing AI and ensure creators' rights are respected.” 

The letter has already received about 700 signatures, according to Deadline. Some of the names we recognized, in no particular order, include Vince Gilligan, Winnie Holzman, OK Go, Olivia Munn, Cyndi Lauper, Jennifer Hudson, They Might Be Giants, Sean Astin, George Saunders, Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Bell, R.E.M., Alex Winter, Cate Blanchett, Chaka Khan, Bonnie Raitt, Aimee Mann, and Fran Drescher. 

The question of AI theft has been circulating for years now and likely isn't going away any time soon. While massive companies like Disney have the option to enter into lucrative deals with OpenAI (after dubbing a rival AI company a “bottomless pit of plagiarism”) the majority of actors, novelists, and whoever else does not have this option. Last year, a group of writers brought a lawsuit against Anthropic AI, alleging that the tech used their copyrighted writing without permission or payment to train its Claude model. The company settled that lawsuit in August.

“Only Murders in the Building” star Martin Short thinks of costar Selena Gomez as one of his daughters. So it's only natural that he's had at least one embarrassing dad moment.

During the Wednesday, January 21, episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”, Short revealed he committed one of the most cringey wedding faux pas possible at Selena's wedding to Benny Blanco.

“First of all, it is such a great thing to go to a wedding where you just know that these people are perfect for each other,” he gushed. “Selena is like an extra child of mine. I adore her so much. And she found this guy, and he's the greatest guy. And they are wildly in love.”

He went on to say that the Santa Barbara wedding was “perfect” and “beautiful.

“Everything was perfect. Except, the night of the reception, it was a big, big party. You know, a stage, a dance floor, and musicians. And big, big tents,” Short continued. “And at the back of these tents, were these individually seating areas with couches and chairs. So if you had a group—like we had a group form ‘Only Murders in the Building,' there was about 12 of us. And there was a cake, a wedding cake, by our section.”

According to the comedian, the cake was unsuspected due to its size. He figured it was safe to assume that each seating area had its own individual cake.

“They haven't cut their wedding cake yet, but after a few hours Steve [Martin] said he was going to leave. I said, ‘Oh Steve, you can't leave yet without a piece of wedding cake,'” he recalled in horror. 

Yes…Martin Short took a fork to Selena Gomez's wedding cake. 

The “Father of the Bride” actor said the whole group screamed at him. He, of course, tried to fix it, to no avail. The big guns were called in, i.e. the wedding coordinator and the chef. 

“It ended up being like a Hollywood wedding cake in that it was beautiful, but now it had a little work done,” he joked. 

Ever gracious, the former Disney star was not going to let a little cake cutting ruin her big day. 

The “Only Murders” crew decided not to tell Gomez “for a month.” Somehow word got around, as the “Wizards of Waverly Place” alum spotted Short and shouted, “Hey Marty, I heard you tried to eat my cake!”

Hilariously enough, in photos from her big day, which Gomez shared via Instagram on September 30, 2025, the damaged dessert is easily visible (in slide 12).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Former ‘American Idol' Mentor Gets Emotional on Live TV","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/jelly-roll-star-search-bear-bailey-emotional-moment/","Thu, 22 Jan 2026 01:27:53 GMT","

Fans of Season 23 of “American Idol” will remember Jelly Roll as the show's “Artist in Residence”; a mentor who didn't just give notes, but actually connected with contestants on a personal level. He helped them shape their sound, encouraged vulnerability, and showed up as his full, unfiltered self. Since then, it seems like his career path has only expanded. 

Jelly Roll is now one of three judges on Netflix's reboot of “Star Search,” and during Episode 2, he had a moment that reminded viewers exactly why people root for him. Let's get real; if you were tuned into tonight's episode, you probably felt it too. That sudden lump in your throat. The pause before clapping. The moment when reality TV stops feeling like reality TV and turns into something way more human. Yep, this was one of those performances.

And honestly? This wasn't about theatrics or camera tricks. It was raw, real, and impossible to ignore.

Near the end of Episode 2, singer Bear Bailey took the stage and delivered a powerful rendition of “Hard Fought Hallelujah” by Brandon Lake feat. Jelly Roll. On paper, that alone could've been enough to raise eyebrows. Performing a judge's song is always a bold move. But here's the thing… that wasn't what cracked Jelly Roll open.

After the performance, Bear shared his personal story, opening up about overcoming addiction and pushing through pain that could've easily broken him. The honesty landed hard. It wasn't polished and it wasn't rehearsed. It was just truth. And if you know anything about Jelly Roll, you know why that mattered.

Jelly Roll has been open for years about his own struggles and the road it took to get where he is now (People). Bear's story clearly spoke to him in a very specific way, and viewers could see it all over Jelly Roll's face. This wasn't just another contestant audition. This was a mirror moment.

See the full episode for yourself on Netflix.

Host Anthony Anderson even pointed out that Bear had chosen the song long before Jelly Roll was announced as a judge, which made the moment feel even more meaningful. Then Bear shared words that shifted the room.

“I'm just an imperfect person who loves a perfect God,” Bear said, thanking the Lord for all he has and for getting him through hard times.

That was the moment. Jelly Roll was visibly emotional; and he didn't shy away from it. He shared that he had prayed that morning for an opportunity to talk about God, and he openly thanked and celebrated the joy he felt in that moment, in the song, and in his faith.

“You took my song and made it yours.”

No overproduction. No forced drama. Just two artists meeting at the intersection of music, faith, and lived experience. And no matter what one believes in, It's moments like this that remind viewers why competition shows like “Star Search,” “American Idol,” and the “Got Talent” series still matter. When the competition fades into the background and the connection takes center stage, that's when it hits hardest… and yep, that's what happened here.

Netflix has canceled The Vince Staples Show. Deadline reports that the comedy series saw a significant decline in viewership between its first season, which earned 4.6 million views in the span of four months, and its second, which drew 1.7 million views between its release in November 2025 and the end of the year. (Most streaming releases are disproportionately watched in the first 90 days.)

The Vince Staples Show premiered in 2024. The series followed a fictionalized version of the rapper in a fictionalized version of his hometown of Long Beach, California. Staples starred alongside Vanessa Bell Calloway, Andrea Ellsworth, Naté Jones, and Beau Billingslea. Rick Ross and comedian Zack Fox also made cameos across the show's 11 total episodes. Staples released his latest album, Dark Times, in 2024.

On stage January 28th through February 7th, 2026..


            Get all the top news & discounts for Washington, DC & beyond.
        

BroadwayWorld spoke to Cher Álvarez about the upcoming production of Paranoma Activity at Shakespeare Theatre Company, running January 28th through February 7th, 2026.

This North American premiere from celebrated playwright Levi Holloway (Broadway's Grey House) and Punchdrunk's Felix Barrett (Sleep No More) features illusions by Tony Award-winner Chris Fisher (Stranger Things: The First Shadow, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child). 

The creative team for Paranormal Activity includes Fly Davis (Scenic & Costume Designer), Anna Watson (Lighting Designer), Gareth Fry (Sound Designer), Luke Halls (Video & Projections Designer), Chris Fisher (Illusions Designer), Bob Mason (Casting), Travis A. Knight (Assistant Director), Camille Etchart (UK Associate Scenic Designer), Abby May (US Associate Lighting Designer), Will Pickens (US Associate Sound Designer), Skylar Fox (Associate Illusions Designer), Daniel Weissglass (Assistant Illusions Designer), and Melanie J. Lisby (Production Stage Manager), Julie Jachym (Assistant Stage Manager). 

What attracted you to the role of Lou in the stage version of Paranormal Activity? 

It's pretty remarkable when the right story falls into your hand and it all feels synchronized. Lou entered my life in a time of acceptance. The uncomfortable reality of accepting yourself, your past, your present, your habits. And her will to fight for the truth, to unveil the darkness and finally confront it for the sake of her healing, it felt incredibly inspiring to me. Reading the script for the first time there was this pulse and it was visceral. There was a drive, a need, to not only survive anymore but to live and the quest as to how the hell do we go about doing that. That's what is paranormal to me: the secrets that we gatekeep out of fear. False. Evidence. Appearing. Real.

How do you relate to your character Lou on a personal level? 

Oh her love. Definitely the love that she chooses to give. Shes a warrior for sure and to still choose love with the risk of sharing and revealing the most inner parts of yourself; the thoughts, the ego, the pain, the hope, that self sabotage ourselves with an ending, a death if you will. She wants to understand, needs to, especially her husband Jimmy. Love being an action , a choice.

How does your background in musical theatre influence your approach to this horror-themed project? 

When immersed in this world you almost feel the timer, the ticking that's relentless but also keeping time. And I believe that has everything to do with it being horror. Fear/terror affects us all so distinctly where time really feels alternate. So yeah some syncopations here and there, maybe some 4/4 and then suddenly 6/8. And Lou is really doing her best to keep time.

The production has been described as suspenseful and scary, how do you prepare mentally for each performance? 

My way into preparation is music. I've created a playlist for her that is such a melting pot of songs and stories. And each day I'll find myself in a different headspace so it's nice to have a little bit of everything. And taking that time to bow. To release her back into the space, a proper check out. Thank her. And the unwinding is being learned to become slower. Check in with myself, reflect and feel all the feelings. Meditate out of it.

How was your experience working with award-winning illusion designer, Chris Fisher? 

Chris and I have only ever interacted virtually; however, the brilliance behind that man's creativity is absolutely bonkers, and to say that I'm honored is an understatement. He's so willing to try, to listen, to explore, to discard. I mean genuinely a team member that is supportive and incredibly faithful to his craft.

Why must audiences come and see the show?

We are living through a time. Like we are actually living in a time of so much confusion, risk, fear. And so much of it we have such little control over. Really, for me at least, what I'm gathering and experiencing is being honest with myself. That feels like that's the way through, for change or transcending. What will it take for you to be honest with yourself and therefore honest with the people you choose to share your life with. And I strongly believe now more than ever is a calling to be just that with yourself; honest.

Raelle Tucker has been a part of the writing room for some of TV's hit series for years, and now it's time for her to become a published author. The writer-producer announced her debut sci-fi novel, ""Obscura,"" which promises to hook fans from the very first page.

According to Variety, Tucker's debut novel centers on the question of whether everything that was seen as make-believe and fairy tales is actually true.

""The island of Obscura is famed for its beaches, drugs, and hedonistic clubs.  But hidden on the northern end of the island is a secret community filled with magical beings, unicorns, centaurs, and mermen, the only place on earth these creatures can be themselves,"" read the official logline.

""When Artemis, the daughter of the haven's pot dealer and its founder, finds a human on the side of the road, tired of playing by the rules, she decides to save him — but will this one act of defiance will burn everything she holds dear to the ground?""

Amy Einhorn at Crown (Penguin Random House) commented Tucker's book immediately had her ""dazzled"" reading the first page, and calls it ""a ride like no other."" Tucker reveals that her debut novel was a story she had wanted to tell for decades, inspired by her ""counterculture childhood"" growing up among artists in Ibiza, and her love of world-building and magical realism.

""'Obscura' is a love letter to outsiders, weirdos, and anyone who's had to hide who they are to survive,"" she said.

If looking for the next sci-fi novel to keep an eye on, fans may want to put Tucker's at the top of the list. The writer and producer made her career in some of the fantasy genre's biggest TV titles. She wrote for the first two seasons of Supernatural before joining Alan Ball for the vampire seriesTrue Blood.

For True Blood, she also rose to become an executive producer in 2013 after having produced six seasons of the series. Her work led to nominated for a Producers Guild award, a Writers Guild award, a Primetime Emmy, and multiple Golden Globes. For Netflix, she wrote and executive-produced season two of Jessica Jones.

In 2023, she co-developed the Amazon Prime Video series The Power, based on the novel by Naomi Alderman.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican authorities said Thursday that they arrested an alleged organized crime figure in the western state of Michoacan in connection with last October's killing of an outspoken leader of the state's lime growers.

Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch said that authorities arrested the man known as “El Botox,” allegedly responsible for extorting lime growers and for various homicides, including the killing of agricultural leader Bernardo Bravo.

A Michoacan state official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed the suspect's full name was César Alejandro Sepúlveda Arellano, leader of a group known as the White Trojans, or Blancos de Troya. The group is known to work with Los Viagras, a criminal organization allied with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.

García Harfuch said there were 11 arrest orders for him for extortion and homicide. He has also been accused of attacking authorities with explosives.

Michoacan Gov. Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla said in a statement that his arrest Thursday represented “an overwhelming blow against extortion” in the state, which is Mexico's largest producer of limes and avocados.

In October, the body of Bravo, president of the Apatzingan Valley Citrus Producers Association, was found in his vehicle on a road in the area.

Bravo had denounced “organized crime's permanent commercial hijacking of any commercial activity.”




Two weeks after his killing, a gunman killed popular Uruapan Mayor Carlos Alberto Manzo, another outspoken critic of the cartels' control of Michoacan. The two homicides and the popular outcry that followed spurred the administration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to send more troops to Michoacan.

Most evolutionary studies on pancreatic cancer rely on bulk sequencing, yet clonal evolution happens at the single-cell level. We used single-nucleus DNA sequencing to study 137,491 single nuclei from 24 pancreatic neoplasms reflecting various clinical scenarios. We found higher frequencies of somatic alterations to driver genes that bulk studies indicate; many manifest as copy number alterations and account for the majority of spatial heterogeneity. In pancreatic cancers with canonical KRAS oncogenic mutations, we found likely varied dependence on the genotype that may signify differential response to KRAS inhibition. In pancreatic cancers with germline heterozygous BRCA2 mutations, we discovered varied mechanisms and timing of inactivation of the wild-type allele that sculpted differential evolutionary trajectories. Inactivation of tumor-intrinsic response to transforming growth factor-β happens through various mechanisms, takes place after oncogenesis and coincides with invasion and metastasis, reflecting increasing selective pressure for the phenotype later in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma development.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancer types with a 5-year survival rate of 13%1. This rate has increased minimally over the past decades despite improvements in surgical and medical management, with PDAC projected to become the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA2. Numerous next-generation sequencing studies have revealed PDAC clonal evolution as a hybrid model of stepwise and punctuated events. Point mutations in multiple driver genes (such as KRAS, CDKN2A or TP53) followed by allelic loss of the wild-type alleles are gained through progressive waves of mutation and selection3, while pervasive copy number variations (CNVs) or larger-scale genomic rearrangements that further grant growth advantages are acquired rapidly after polyploidization. Polyploidization coincides temporally with the loss of the wild-type TP53 allele and the acquisition of invasive potential4,5. The identification of these genomic events has largely been accomplished by sequencing of bulk tissues; in some cases, resolution has been increased by the use of highly purified microdissected samples and/or development of computational tools to deconvolve the complexity of subclonal mixtures6,7,8.

Regardless, because clonal evolution occurs at the single-cell level, bulk sequencing would be unable to order successive events or to distinguish mutually exclusive events, indicating distinct populations. Thus, single-cell DNA sequencing (snDNA-seq) is required to further determine the clonal evolution and heterogeneity of PDAC. This goal is urgent because collaborative research efforts across the globe have revealed several opportunities for precision medicine. New therapeutic approaches such as poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors, KRAS inhibitors and immunotherapies are being developed to target individual tumors' vulnerabilities with promising results9,10,11,12. Nonetheless, responses to these therapies have been mixed with some patients' showing no benefit13.

We previously optimized a scalable workflow to apply high-throughput snDNA-seq to archival PDAC samples14. Here we used this workflow and developed an accompanying set of computational methods to generate the highest-resolution view of general genomic evolution patterns over the course of PDAC evolution, spanning early invasion to dissemination to secondary sites. Such high resolution that preserves information regarding co-occurring compared to mutually exclusive mutations has revealed insights into PDAC biology, ranging from innate mechanisms of KRAS resistance to genetic features of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) tumors in patients with germline BRCA2 mutations, and finally to molecular pathways that are under relatively constant selection.

We analyzed single-cell genomic features in 24 patients with primary pancreatic neoplasms. The cohort included samples from patients with both early-stage disease collected from surgical resections (n = 10 patients) and late-stage unresectable disease from research autopsies (n = 11 patients; Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Matched longitudinal biopsies taken by 18-G/22-G core needle biopsies before and after treatment were collected from six patients (Supplementary Table 2). The final pathologic diagnosis for 23 patients was PDAC, and for 1 additional patient, it was an acinar cell carcinoma (ACC; patient PC22). We opted to study the latter patient, given their clinical-grade sequencing indicated a germline mutation in BRCA2; five of the PDAC patients had documented germline BRCA2 mutations as well, providing an opportunity to understand genomic features of neoplasms that arise in the setting of this set of high-risk germline variants. Collectively, a total of 30 primary tumor samples and 42 metastases were studied (Supplementary Table 3). For 21 patients, at least two spatially distinct samples were studied per patient (range = 2–9). Metastases from 35 secondary sites were sampled in the autopsy participants, with a median of two metastases (range = 1–7) studied per patient.

To discern the genetic features of our cohort, we performed targeted snDNA-seq using a custom-designed 596-amplicon panel targeting known essential genes of primary pancreatic neoplasms; genes affected by both single-nucleotide variant (SNV), small insertion/deletion (indel) and/or CNVs were considered (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 and Methods). With a custom-designed computational analysis pipeline (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), in total 137,491 snDNA libraries were profiled by snDNA-seq with a mean of 5,729 per patient (range = 329–20,123) and 1,858 single nuclei studied per sample (range = 50–7,540; Supplementary Fig. 1c). We detected somatic SNVs, indels, monoallelic and/or biallelic losses in at least one known driver gene in all cases analyzed (Fig. 1b), even in low-cellularity biopsy samples (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Activating KRAS mutations were identified in all but two PDACs (21/23, 91%). Targeted clinical-grade sequencing performed for these two neoplasms revealed a BRAF fusion and an NRG fusion, respectively, that were not on our panel. No KRAS mutation was found in the ACC (PC22). Alterations in TP53 (75%), CDKN2A (71%) and SMAD4 (71%) were also observed at high frequency, as expected15. Copy number (CN) alterations identified included amplifications in MYC (46%), GATA6 (17%) and MTOR (4%, one case), as well as biallelic loss (homozygous deletion) in genes such as CDKN2A (67%), SMAD4 (25%) and TGFBR2 (8%, two cases). A technical strength of snDNA-seq compared to bulk sequencing is that it enables direct calculation of each alteration's corresponding cancer cell fraction (CCF; Methods); as a result, we could distinguish among clonal drivers such as TP53 (mean CCF = 0.85), MYC (0.83), CDKN2A (0.82), KRAS (0.76) and ‘relative' subclonal drivers such as SMAD4 (0.70), ARID1A (0.47) and PIK3CA (0.45) (Fig. 1b, square size), yet heterogeneity of clonality existed for almost every gene.

Subclonal and subgene (affecting only a part of the gene) monoallelic/biallelic losses may be difficult to detect with bulk-sequencing methods, particularly in PDACs with limited tumor purity. Our targeted snDNA-seq method evaluated each mutant locus's single-cell variant allele fraction (sc-VAF) and the read counts for single amplicons (200–300 bp) while accounting for amplicon dropout rates14, to detect such events in small groups of cells (Methods). For instance, we could visualize a homozygous deletion confined to a single amplicon of SMAD4 in the neoplastic clone of PC18 (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Across the cohort we detected more alterations (including both short mutation and monoallelic/biallelic loss) to CDKN2A and SMAD4 (71% and 71%, respectively), many subclonal, than reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas (30%, 32%) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (30%, 27%). Specifically, we detected homozygous deletion of CDKN2A in 67% cases and SMAD4 in 25% cases, which are comparable to the numbers (~60% CDKN2A; 40% SMAD4) found in a mixed cohort of primaries/metastases using microdissection to enrich for tumor content7. Compared with previous reports of approximately 40% alteration frequency of p14ARF region (alternate transcript of CDKN2A)16, we found that some part of p14ARF was deleted in all 16 cases with deletion in the region, 12 of which had apparent deletion to all three exons of both p16INK6a and p14ARF. Of the other four cases that showed subgene deletion in the region (PC07, PC09, PC14 and PC16), none preferentially inactivated p14ARF over p16INK6a. We also detected a high frequency of monoallelic losses (loss of heterozygosity, LOH) affecting TGFBR1 (21%) and TGFBR2 (29%). We interpret these findings to reflect the increase in sensitivity by our assay rather than more extensive sampling, as these rates are also higher than reported in a recent study of 91 multiregion sampled PDAC research autopsies17.

While our samples included nuclei from non-neoplastic stromal cells, we were unable to discern if these nuclei were non-neoplastic epithelial, fibroblastic, neural, vascular or immune in origin. Nonetheless, mutations in lineages independent of the PDAC were noted in four cases. In PC05, a DNMT3A p.R882H mutation was found, mutually exclusive with the neoplastic cells (Supplementary Fig. 2c). This mutation is a common hotspot in clonal hematopoiesis18. PC14 had a CTNNA2 p.R136H mutation that was also mutually exclusive with the neoplastic cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d). PC22 had an RNF43 p.A349V mutation and an MTOR p.I313T mutation, both mutually exclusive with the neoplastic cells and each other (Supplementary Fig. 2e). We found only one case (PC11) with a secondary oncogenic KRAS mutation that did not belong to the tumor lineage (elaboration to follow).

Building upon our previous work19, we developed fast Constrained Dollo Reconstruction (fast-ConDoR), a phylogenetic analysis pipeline for this snDNA-seq dataset (Supplementary Fig. 1a and Methods) and derived phylogenies for each patient (Fig. 1c). On average, 2.63 clonal driver SNV events (Methods) were covered by our panel, consistent with the number calculated unbiasedly by bulk whole-exome sequencing (WES)17. Among all driver SNVs identified, on average, 74.4% were clonal in origin (that is, occurred before the MRCA of all clones identified) in keeping with prior estimates17. This indicates that the major contributor to intratumoral heterogeneity in PDAC is CNVs, as illustrated by the longitudinally sampled PC20—most of the SNV events and relevant LOHs were clonal, while total CNs varied across clones 1 and 2, the former dominating at baseline while the latter emerging at metastasis (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). This pattern of early driver fixation, followed by generation of intratumoral heterogeneity via CNVs, is consistent with multiregional bulk sequencing of larger PDAC cohorts20. The number of subclones resolved per case was not correlated with the number of single nuclei analyzed, as demonstrated by two edge cases—PC11 had one of the highest patient-level library sizes (16,139 single nuclei) but only three tumor clones, while PC21 had only 329 single nuclei but four tumor clones.

Mutation events are labeled on the trunk and branches of the phylogeny. Green events are LOHs of germline heterozygous SNPs. Red events are somatic SNVs, while purple events are LOH to them. CNVs that do not have corresponding SNP/SNV events are not labeled.

Clone colors correspond to those in a. The heat represents the total CN state of each clone at each genomic location. c, Single-cell clone phylogeny of PC10. d, Clonal proportions mapped to metastatic lesions sampled across PC10. Human anatomy in d was adapted from BioRender. Zhang, H. (2025) https://BioRender.com/e026ra1.

As our panel targets driver mutations that are previously known and hereby confirmed to exhibit homogeneity across metastatic sites (two example cases shown in Supplementary Fig. 3c,d), our capacity to assess genetic heterogeneity and, in turn, metastatic seeding patterns was limited in most metastatic cases we sampled. However, PC10 demonstrated stark CN heterogeneity of MYC, MTOR and GATA6 that allowed us to reaffirm the random metastatic patterns previously inferred by bulk WES20,21, The total CN of MYC stayed in the normal range in clones 1 and 2 in the upper branch, but uniformly amplified to over 20 in clones 3, 4 and 5 (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). Such an amplification pattern was inferred to be caused by extrachromosomal DNA22 (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Clones 1 and 2 in the upper branch had MTOR amplification instead. Intriguingly, clone 3, exclusively present in the primary tumor sampled, showed uniquely high CN state in GATA6; two populations with or without high CN state of MYC co-existed in clone 3 (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 4a).

As we mapped the clones to their anatomical location (Fig. 2d), we found little correlation between spatial proximity and clonal similarity. Notably, the two subclonal lineages defined by two TGFBR2 mutations migrated likely through hematogenous routes to the pleura, diaphragm, lung and its adjacent lymph node, while the two subclonal lineages defined by extrachromosomal DNA-cause MYC amplification migrated likely through similar means to the liver and pericardium. The polyclonal seeding and bifurcating migration correspond to patterns predicted by a single-stage evolution model, where founder cells of the metastatic lesions were apparently randomly sampled from the available lineages within the primary or secondary sites23.

Oncogenic KRAS mutations have been well established as early drivers of PDAC through precursor lesion studies24 and genetically engineered mouse models25. Allelic imbalance or amplification of mutated KRAS alleles has also been described in association with progression and metastasis26. Across cases, we also observed a wide range of KRAS mutant VAFs, consistent with the presence of subclonal populations within each PDAC containing KRAS allelic imbalance or amplification (Fig. 3a, top). On average, the highest KRAS mutant sc-VAFs were found in advanced stage of PDACs (\(\hat{\beta }\) = 0.13, s.e. = 0.08, one-sided P = 0.054)—for instance, PC12, PC13, PC16 and PC17—underscoring the role of increased KRAS-dependent signaling in PDAC progression. Unexpectedly, 9 out of 21 (42.9%) KRAS-mutant cases were noted to have subclones (>10% tumor cells) without any read of oncogenic KRAS mutation; this exceeded the technical dropout rate at 10% (Fig. 3a, bottom). For example, in PC19 (Fig. 3b–e) and PC03 (Fig. 3f–h), there existed large subclones carrying the other driver mutations (TP53 for PC19, MAP2K4 and TP53 for PC03) but not the KRAS mutation. While it is possible that in these PDACs the KRAS mutation occurred later than other oncogenic mutations (that is, TP53) in the neoplasm, a more parsimonious explanation is that the KRAS mutation was lost in a subpopulation of the cancer cells. This is consistent with mouse models suggesting the loss of oncogenic Kras signaling after PDAC formation is tolerable27,28. Of note, we did not observe any examples of a KRAS-mutant PDAC carrying a second subclonal KRAS mutation, except for one patient (PC11), where a minor KRAS mutant subclone was identified across three spatially distinct samples of the primary tumor (single-cell prevalence = 0.0083). This minor clone was a distinct lineage with little correlation to the primary PDAC (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b), corresponding to one or more KRAS-mutant clones present within the pancreatic parenchyma that was infiltrated by the main PDAC24,29.

Bottom, the value of 0.1 is labeled by the dashed line. Cases are grouped by stage at collection, with ‘mixed' indicating that the case (PC20) had one sample at the early stage and another at the late stage. The box plot indicates the median, first and third quartiles (hinges); for each case, the number of cells/nuclei studied is provided in Supplementary Table 3. b, Single-cell clone phylogeny of PC19. c, For PC19, a Venn diagram showing the colocalization of TP53 mutation and KRAS mutation-carrying cells.

In the right panel, an sc-VAF of −50 indicates 0 read depth at the locus. For example, the top fraction of cells in clone 2 (orange) has reduced total CN and sc-VAF at KRAS-mutated locus, suggesting a likely loss of the mutated allele. f, Single-cell clone phylogeny of PC03. g, For PC03, single-cell binarized genotype heatmap of the five main somatic mutations across tumor clones. h, Venn diagram showing the colocalization of MAP2K4 mutation and KRAS mutation-carrying cells. i,j, Venn diagrams demonstrating colocalization of PIK3CA mutations with KRAS mutations for PC14 (i) and PC11 (j).

In addition to allelic imbalance favoring KRAS mutation dosage, we also found independent mechanisms to activate oncogenic MAPK–ERK signaling that likely succeeded mutant KRAS. For example, PC03 had a clonal MAP2K4 p.P232L mutation (Fig. 3f–h), while PC14 had a clonal PIK3CA p.Q545K mutation, and both colocalized with their KRAS mutations (Fig. 3h,i). In PC11 that had a clonal KRAS p.G12V mutation and was sampled from metastatic disease at autopsy, we noted two mutually exclusive subclonal PIK3CA mutations (p.E542K CCF = 0.009, p.K528E CCF = 0.002) that were scattered across metastatic sites (Fig. 3j and Supplementary Fig. 5c). These alternative mutations correspond to differential regulation of the MAPK–ERK signaling pathways favored later in cancer progression and could inform resistance mechanisms to KRAS inhibiting therapeutics.

Although patients with germline mutations in the BRCA2 gene are associated with an inherited risk of developing PDAC as well as increased sensitivity to platinum salts, the evolutionary features of how pancreatic neoplasms arise in the setting of germline BRCA2 mutations are poorly understood. Among six germline BRCA2 mutation cases in our cohort, we noted biallelic BRCA2 inactivation in all six cases through different mechanisms, indicating positive epistasis of somatic BRCA2 inactivation in a germline BRCA2 mutation background in PDAC (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.001). Tumor cells of PC20, PC21, PC22 and PC23 lost the wild-type BRCA2 allele (LOH; Supplementary Fig. 5d), while PC01 and PC24 had inactivating somatic mutations to BRCA2 (Fig. 1b). Mutation signature analysis confirmed homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) phenotype in all six cases (Supplementary Fig. 5e).

The median CCF for BRCA2 somatic alterations was 1, suggesting their generally early occurrence that was followed by one or more clonal sweeps before sampling. Nevertheless, for four of these patients, phylogenetic analysis provided more profound insight into the timing of inactivation of the remaining wild-type allele relative to other somatic alterations in the same PDAC. The phylogeny of PC01 showed that the somatic BRCA2 nonsense mutation was truncal, followed by several other LOH events and CDKN2A homozygous deletion (Fig. 4a, left). The phylogeny subsequently diverged into two mutually exclusive subclones carrying an FGFR1 p.T17K mutation with LOH, or a TGFBR2 p.K330Tfs*6 mutation with LOH. The subclones were separated spatially (Fig. 4a, right). Clinical-grade sequencing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) independently performed on the same tissue identified a TRIM24–BRAF translocation, a KRAS-independent route toward oncogenic MAPK activation, suggesting that this PDAC developed through noncanonical mechanisms. Similarly, case PC23 showed a truncal BRCA2 LOH (Fig. 4b), with no detectable alteration to other canonical PDAC driver genes; clinical-grade sequencing and WGS indicated an NRG fusion, another noncanonical oncogenic mechanism converging to the same pathway as KRAS. We interpret these findings to mean that biallelic inactivation of BRCA2 was among the earliest events in these two PDACs, leading to HRD in the MRCA and, subsequently, KRAS-independent activation of MAPK signaling via gene rearrangements involving TRIM24–BRAF (PC01) and NRG (PC23).

The clone of interest is clone 2, where the germline BRCA2 locus likely had homozygous deletion (homdel).

By contrast, in case PC20, while the wild-type BRCA2 allele was inferred to be lost along with occurrence of the other driver events (Fig. 4c), we observed a small population of cells containing a heterozygous germline BRCA2 p.I2627F mutation, a heterozygous somatic KRAS p.Q61H mutation, a CDKN2A homozygous deletion and a homozygous somatic ARID1A p.R1989P mutation (Fig. 4d). The ARID1A p.R1989P homozygous genotype and germline single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) LOH validated this population as nondoublet and indicated that BRCA2 LOH likely came after the canonical PDAC driver SNV and CNV events. The somatic BRCA2 p.S1832Ifs*2 mutation of PC24 was not covered by our snDNA-seq panel; yet WGS suggested a lower CCF (0.80) than the two main drivers KRAS p.G12D (0.85) and SMAD4 p.Q116* (1.00), categorizing it into a similar late-BRCA2 biallelic inactivation group. We interpret these findings to mean that, in these two PDACs, biallelic inactivation of BRCA2, and thus the HRD phenotype, was acquired after accumulation of canonical PDAC alterations.

In PC21, we observed in the liver metastasis a tumor subclone where BRCA2 was homozygously deleted and CDKN2A was intact, in contrast to the main tumor population where BRCA2 had LOH and CDKN2A had homozygous deletion (Fig. 4e,f). Both populations had the canonical drivers KRAS p.G12D and TP53 p.L344Q; yet orthogonal statistical testing validated that the BRCA2 homozygous deletion colocalized with a heterozygous TP53 state (P = 0.0078; Supplementary Methods), while the main tumor population had TP53 LOH. A parsimonious explanation is that BRCA2 had LOH before TP53 LOH and CDKN2A homozygous deletion, and that the mutated BRCA2 allele was subsequently lost, resulting in the subclone in the liver biopsy.

In summary, although a somatic BRCA2 second hit is associated with an HRD phenotype, the timing at which this second hit occurs can happen at different time points of PDAC development—in some patients, BRCA2 biallelic inactivation defines the MRCA and drives PDAC in a noncanonical mutational route characterized by genomic rearrangements. By contrast, in other patients, the second hit occurs after accumulation of other canonical drivers such as KRAS and TP53 and functions as an additive trait later in PDAC progression.

PDAC genetics are notable for a high frequency of mutations in KRAS, CDKN2A, TP53 and SMAD4 (ref. 15). However, an unanswered question is the extent to which small populations of cells with additional mutations in known PDAC genes or pathways exist below the resolution of bulk-sequencing methods. The presence of such populations would indicate the pre-existence of subclones that are poised for selection when encountering new microenvironments or treatment bottlenecks, whereas the absence of them would favor strong selection and one or more clonal sweeps of the neoplasm after these mutations occurred.

The absence of rare subclones derived from the MRCA of each PDAC carrying secondary mutations to KRAS, TP53 and CDKN2A strongly supports that mutations to these genes undergo strong selection before sampling. By contrast, in many PDACs the TGFβ pathway appears subject to continuous selection over the evolutionary lifetime of the PDAC, seen as multiple relevant mutations converging within the same tumors (Fig. 1b). Such convergence manifested as different genetic subclones in parallel—in PC01, three lineages each carrying (1) TGFBR2 p.K300Tfs*6, (2) TGFBR2 p.A426G/p.M425I and (3) SMAD3 p.S425F mutations (Fig. 4a) co-existed before the early-stage tumor was resected. In other cases, this manifested as different events take place sequentially in a single lineage—PC08 had three TGFβ family receptors focally deleted, whereas PC06, PC10 and PC12 all had alteration to both TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 (Fig. 1b). PC11 (described as PA04 in previous work14) had two independent mutations to SMAD4 on the same chromosome, which translate to 13 codons apart, followed by the loss of the wild-type allele (Fig. 5a, left) and finally homozygous deletion to 10 of 11 amplicons of SMAD4 in the MRCA of all tumor clones (Fig. 5a, right). In the same patient, we observed a subclone with TGFBR2 LOH exclusively present in the liver metastasis and one region of the primary, which further contributed to the phenotype of TGFβ inactivation30 (Fig. 5b). In PC10, two subclonal TGFBR1 nonsense mutations were noted in one of the two main lineages of metastatic disease in this patient (Fig. 5c). Focal analysis of the subclone suggested that the two mutations were present on different chromosomes in the same set of cells at one time in the tumor's evolution history (population ii in Fig. 5d), and then chromosomal loss likely resulted in the LOH of either mutation creating bifurcating lineages (populations iii and iv in Fig. 5d).

The density is labeled as colors and contours, with darker colors indicating higher density of single cells. The four major populations of interest are circled and labeled. e, The clonal status of TGFβ mutations across all cases studied.

Notably, polyclonal, parallel convergence was observed only in one early-stage (resectable) PDAC case, whereas monoclonal, sequential convergence was observed repeatedly in late-stage disease. This suggests differential selective pressure across stages of tumor development, with potentially less selection at early stages, allowing for polyclonal evolution, whereas elevated selection forces monoclonal evolution. At the cohort level, in contrast to the model that places inactivation of tumor-intrinsic response to TGFβ before invasive tumor formation, we found that these alterations are mostly subtruncal in early-stage cases and truncal in late-stage cases (Fig. 5e). Together, these results indicate that strong selective pressures imposed by the primary and secondary site microenvironments continuously sculpt for convergence toward failure to respond to TGFβ growth inhibitory signals.

These data, based on high-resolution snDNA-seq, elucidate the closest-to-ground-truth pancreatic cancer genome in such contexts as early/late diagnosis, metastasis and nontargeted (that is, cytotoxic/cytostatic) treatments. Notably, we identified three features of the evolutionary life history of the pancreatic cancer genome (Fig. 6), two of which have direct implications for precision medicine.

a, In contrast to tumor suppressors such as TP53 and BRCA2 that almost always undergo multiple inactivation (for instance, one mutation + LOH) indicating ongoing selection for the corresponding phenotype, we found that oncogenic KRAS dosage varies across PDACs in our cohort, with some cases gaining/amplifying the mutated allele subclonally (top), while others gaining the mutation late or, more likely, losing the allele as the tumor progresses (as studies on precursors concluded that the rate of PDAC not initiated by a KRAS mutation is low). In the latter cases (bottom), alternative mutation mechanisms may contribute to a similar MAPK–ERK pathway hyperactivation phenotype. This is clinically important as PDACs showing less oncogenic KRAS dosage and potentially less dependence on it would be inherently insensitive to KRAS inhibitors. b, We showed that although somatic biallelic inactivation of BRCA2 is preferred in the background of a germline BRCA2 mutation, it could either take place early and drive PDAC in a noncanonical mutational route likely dominated by HRD-associated genomic instabilities, or take place later than canonical drivers such as oncogenic KRAS and TP53 alterations and function as an additive trait. Although current clinical practices usually put patients with germline mutations in BRCA2 in one group for treatment, such a finding could inform further stratification. c, Strong selective pressure, not at tumorigenesis but more likely after invasive tumor formation, selects for convergence toward mutation to the TGFβ pathway, and the pressure continues as the tumor continues to metastasize to secondary sites, resulting in continuous evolution to inactivate the pathway. This sometimes manifests as different tumor subclones carrying different mutations, but more often as one lineage carrying multiple mutations to TGFβ pathway, indicating strong selective pressure that favors rapid clonal sweeps. The figure was adapted from BioRender. Zhang, H. (2025) https://BioRender.com/y8ik2jm.

In a sizable fraction of the PDACs analyzed, we found that the KRAS-mutant allele was lost in at least 10% tumor cells (Fig. 6a). This raises the possibility that resistance to allele-specific KRAS inhibitors may develop through loss of the mutant allele. Data from our institution found one colorectal cancer, harboring KRAS p.G12C mutation and treated with sotorasib, developed allelic imbalance favoring the wild-type KRAS allele through its amplification31. This reduction of the mutated allele's dosage post-treatment added plausibility of mutant KRAS loss as a potential resistance mechanism to KRAS-targeted therapies. As expected, we also observed that oncogenic KRAS dosage varied across PDACs in our cohort, with several cases having allelic imbalance favoring mutant KRAS alleles; we also noted some PDACs with additive mechanisms to MAPK activation, such as PIK3CA mutations. These are known resistance mechanisms to targeted KRAS inhibitors and further indicate that KRAS inhibitor resistance mechanisms are pre-existent in PDACs that have not been exposed to these therapies. The extent to which KRAS allelic imbalance in favor of the mutant allele, the wild-type allele or convergent modes of MAPK activation leads to insensitivity to KRAS inhibition remains to be revealed by ongoing clinical trials32.

Reversion mutations in BRCA2-mutant tumors are a known resistance mechanism to targeted therapies that exploit deficiencies in homologous recombination33. However, our findings suggest that the timing of biallelic inactivation of BRCA2 provides an additional mechanism for consideration (Fig. 6b). In patients with germline BRCA2 alterations, we discovered varied timing of somatic biallelic inactivation of BRCA2 and the development of the HRD phenotype in relation to other oncogenic events, which may explain heterogeneous treatment responses in patients with similar germline BRCA2 genotypes34. Still, our cohort size was too small to draw conclusions related to how these differences may affect outcome, particularly outside of a controlled clinical trial setting. Future studies to confirm or refute such a correlation are in progress with the goal of improved understanding of germline BRCA2 mutant PDACs.

The approach also revealed more granular features of the genetic progression model, such as frequent subclonal deletions in CDKN2A and SMAD4, supporting their classification as later events in the genetic progression of PDAC, likely arising from increased genomic instability and selective pressures experienced during invasion of the pancreatic parenchyma. Compared to other driver events such as KRAS and TP53 alterations, where a single event dominated in each PDAC, corresponding to a near-complete clonal sweep of such single events during tumorigenesis, multiple TGFβ pathway alterations clonally evolve in sequence or in parallel, signifying convergent evolution sculpted by continuous selective pressure during PDAC progression in the primary and secondary sites (Fig. 6c). This finding may explain the lack of clinical benefit when targeting TGFβ in patients based on numerous clinical trials conducted thus far35.

Our findings are based on targeted snDNA-seq and a suite of accompanying computational analysis tools. Such a large-scale application of this technique on clinical solid tumor samples supports its further clinical utility—the wet-lab workflow is largely automated and accommodates challenging clinical samples such as small frozen biopsy samples. One exception is that it currently cannot perform on formalin-fixed tissues, possibly due to DNA damage caused by the fixation process. Furthermore, given single-cell studies' potential to bring about new biological insights36, a targeted workflow enables high-depth sequencing of actionable genes/pathways and yields more clinically relevant information than low-depth pan-genome methods aimed more at biological discovery37,38, as demonstrated by the success of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT)39. We acknowledge the limitations of targeted snDNA-seq, which mostly allows for granular studies of already known targets instead of discovering new targets. Although we curated our targeted panel based on WES/WGS data from the selected patients, a small fraction of important genetic events remained unrepresented. For these reasons, we suggest that the current best practice is for snDNA-seq to be paired with highly purified bulk sequencing with the WES/WGS done first to explore and define the mutational landscape of interest, followed by snDNA-seq to further elucidate the clonal evolution of events of interest.

The use of human samples in this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at MSK (under protocols 06-107, 15-021 and 15-149).

Patient samples used in this study consist of the following three categories: multiregionally sampled surgical resection of primary pancreatic cancer, multiregionally sampled autopsy of metastatic pancreatic cancer and longitudinally sampled biopsies of pancreatic cancer. Each participating patient provided written and informed consent and was not compensated. Detailed patient and sample information is summarized in Supplementary Tables 1–3.

For multiregional sampled surgical resections, treatment of naive patients with tumors of ≥2 cm on cross-sectional imaging were identified preoperatively. A single cross-sectional piece of tumor was sampled sequentially using a Cartesian coordinate system with 0.6 × 0.6-cm grid, with three to five samples obtained from each tumor. An adjacent normal pancreas or duodenum was also collected. All samples were stored at −80 °C until use.

For multiregional sampled autopsies, all patients had a premortem diagnosis of PDAC based on pathological review of resected biopsy material and/or radiographic and biomarker studies. Rapid autopsy was performed after our previously described workflow20.

The above two types of tissue sample were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and reviewed by a gastrointestinal pathologist (S.U.) to ensure total cellularity and tumor purity. Normal samples were reviewed to confirm that no contaminating cancer cells were present. Tissues were sectioned to optimize a volume >8 mm3 for nuclei extraction.

For longitudinally sampled biopsies, tissue cores were obtained using a 22-gauge needle at endoscopic ultrasound for primary tumors or an 18-gauge needle at interventional radiology for metastatic lesions and were flash-frozen until use. The biopsy samples were substantially smaller than the two sample types described above, often too small to be visible to the naked eye, precluding pathologic review for cellularity or tumor purity. Tissues stored in collection tubes were suspended in nuclei storage buffer (S2 Genomics) and then transferred directly into the Singulator machine (S2 Genomics) for single-nucleus extraction. Albeit the suboptimal input amount, even those biopsies with the lowest yields (that is, PC18) resulted in useful genotype information (Supplementary Fig. 1d), thus proving the feasibility of applying this snDNA-seq approach to routine clinical biopsies.

Additionally, because we were initially concerned that the small number of biopsies would be insufficient for snDNA library construction, we expanded four of six samples from one case (PC16) into organoids to increase cell numbers. The organoid workflow was as previously described40.

Worth noting is that microdissection was omitted so that the resulting snDNA libraries were mostly mixes of tumor and normal cells.

Bulk WGS/WES data were collected for each tumor and matched normal sample simultaneously for quality control (QC) of germline/somatic and SNV event calling. Genomic DNA was extracted from each tissue using the phenol-chloroform extraction protocol or QIAamp DNA Mini Kits (Qiagen). DNA quantification, library preparation and sequencing were performed in the Integrated Genomics Operation, where Illumina HiSeq 2000, HiSeq 2500, HiSeq 4000, NovaSeq 6000 and NovaSeq X platforms were used to target sequencing coverages of >80× for WGS samples and >150× for WES samples.

Bioinformatics analyses, including calling germline/somatic SNVs, CNV and structural variants, estimating mutational signatures, and scoring HRDetect41, were performed using the time-efficient mutational profiling in oncology research pipeline at the MSK Center for Molecular Oncology Computational Sciences. Its code repository is available at https://github.com/mskcc/tempo and documentation at https://cmotempo.netlify.app/.

Single nuclei from optimal cutting temperature-embedded snap-frozen primary tissue samples were extracted, counted, quality-controlled and cryopreserved after our published protocol14.

The panel was designed as an expansion of our previous 186-amplicon panel14 with the following goals:

To unbiasedly cover genes/genomic segments hypothesized to undergo convergent evolution in PDAC, constituting the following three main categories:

Canonical PDAC drivers—KRAS, TP53, SMAD4 and CDKN2A.

Components of the TGFβ pathway, including receptors, mediators and downstream effectors—TGFBR1, TGFBR2, ACVR1B, ACVR2A, BMPR1A, BMPR1B, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD7, ARID1A, ARID1B and ARID2.

The BRCA2 gene, which is of particular interest to PDAC precision medicine.

To study genes frequently affected by CNV in PDAC, including MYC, GATA6, BAP1, MUS81 and KAT5. Thus, over four amplicons were given per gene. At analysis, amplicons for the same gene were constrained to have the same ploidy to obviate the PCR amplification noise of single amplicons and get more confident absolute ploidy calls.

To study other recurrent mutations in PDAC, which came from the curation of the following two databases:

Bulk WES/WGS of PDAC autopsy, resection, derived-organoid banks consisting of over 100 patients collected by the Iacobuzio lab and the MSK David M. Rubenstein Center for Pancreatic Cancer Research.

MSK Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets sequencing of PDAC attained from MSK cbioportal42,43,44.

The final design was 596 amplicons covering 253 genes' UCSC canonical exon transcripts. The full list of amplicons and more details are provided in Supplementary Table 4.

Library preparation and sequencing were done as described in our previous paper, except that for this batch of samples, we used the custom 596-amplicon panel described above.

FASTQ files for snDNA libraries were processed through Mission Bio's Tapestri pipeline with default parameters. Briefly, it trims adaptor sequences, aligns reads to the hg19 genome (UCSC) and assigns reads to cell barcodes. The CellFinder module then filtered for barcodes corresponding to ‘complete cells/nucleus' based on total read completeness (>8 × number of amplicons) and per-amplicon read completeness (>80% data completeness for working amplicons, which are defined as amplicons with >0.2 × mean of all amplicon reads per qualified barcode).

As a first pass, with aligned snDNA reads (binary alignment maps, BAMs), Mutect2 (GATK, v.4.2.5.0) was used for mutation calling and filtering in each single-cell BAM. Preliminary technical filters were applied, including ‘base_qual/low_allele_frac/weak_evidence/slippage/multiallelic/clustered_events'. Required minimum depth was four reads and VAF was 0.2. Still, we observed many called mutations present in small numbers of single barcodes, which are likely false positives from PCR/sequencing errors. We concatenated mutations called in each single cell, and with the belief that the false-positive rate of a mutation decreases exponentially with the number of barcodes it is detected in, we only considered mutations present in ≥3 single cells. It should be noted that the choice of three single cells was arbitrary and came from empirical testing, where a prevalence filter of three single cells filtered out good amounts of false-positive mutations while leaving enough mutations for downstream, more stringent filters to be described below.

As a second pass, we used the mutation list from the first pass for genotyping in each single-cell BAM with ‘bcftools mpileup', outputting a mutation by single-cell matrix that has information for each mutation in each single cell.

Furthermore, to enable de novo mutation calling, we performed the following QC steps, inspired by bulk DNA-seq bioinformatics.

Sampling multiple regions of a tumor enables mutations that have a large clonal fraction in one sample but lower than detection threshold fraction in another to be captured in the latter. Therefore, mutations from all samples of the same tumor were pooled and genotyped in all single nuclei with ‘bcftools mpileup'.

In both neoplastic and normal samples taken from different organ sites, we noticed a substantially similar mutational signature, signified by a large proportion of T > C variants, enriched in mutations of <0.5% single-cell prevalence detected by this snDNA-seq technology (Supplementary Fig. 1b). As different types of human tissues have been shown to display distinct mutational signatures and the signature did not seem to match any of them45, we deemed it likely artifactual and decided to filter out all mutations below 0.5% single-cell prevalence. T > C variants in the 0.5–1% were also filtered.

A PON, proven effective in eliminating library artifacts in bulk sequencing, was assembled for snDNA-seq from the following three sources:

Eight unrelated normal pancreas samples were subject to the same snDNA-seq and mutational calling process (until filtering by prevalence). Variants called in ≥4 unmatched normal samples were discarded.

Variants present in a bulk WES PON (gs://gatk-best-practices/somatic-b37/Mutect2-exome-panel.vcf) were discarded.

snDNA-seq SNV lists of all tumor samples studied here were concatenated, and variants called in >50% samples, except for those in known hotspot (KRAS codon 12), were discarded. Manual curation proved this effective in removing low-prevalence SNVs likely caused by library error, and confirmed that no driver mutations identified by matched bulk sequencing were discarded.

To retain real SNPs/SNVs with high prevalence in the population, variants with a frequency >0.01 in the 1000G Project were whitelisted.

As our phylogenetic analysis relies on high-density single-cell VAF signal of mutations, those with >0.3 biallelic dropout rate in any sample were discarded.

With snDNA-seq, because we can observe VAF of each SNV in each single cell, we could calculate CCF directly by designating one clonal population as cancer, and measure the number of cells within that population that show a confident signal for each mutation.

We first genotyped each mutation in each cell based on hard thresholding—a mutation is considered positive in a cell given ≥3 mutant reads, ≥0.2 VAF and ≥8 total depth.

To define the cancer clonal population, tumor cells were defined as those classified as nondiploid by Tapestri-CN, a single-cell CN-calling tool to be described below. Using CN to define cancer cells was preferred over indexing on particular mutations, as other bulk-sequencing bioinformatics, for the following three reasons:

It does not make any assumption based on a priori knowledge.

Using CN to define cancer cells is prevalent in single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of PDAC46.

It orthogonally quantifies clonality of SNVs without using any SNV as reference, thereby providing an objective view of relative clonality among SNVs, which is the primary goal for CCF calculation.

Amplifications and homozygous deletions' CCFs were calculated as the proportion of their corresponding clones as inferred by Tapestri-CN. The CCFs of LOHs were calculated as the proportion of their corresponding clones as inferred by fast-ConDoR.

The CCF value of 0.75 to distinguish between clonal and subclonal drivers was chosen empirically (similar to prior literature using bulk sequencing47) as we observed a clear gap dividing two clusters (cluster 1, TP53, CDKN2A, KRAS; cluster 2, SMAD4, ARID1A etc.) at that value. It should be cautioned that this snDNA-seq CCF calculation was subject to noise from technical dropout and sampling errors, and the values should only be used for quantifying ‘relative' clonality among SNVs.

We developed a new tool, ‘Tapestri-CN' to infer the CN profiles of individual cells from the snDNA-seq data. The tumor sample from each patient is composed of multiple cancer clones with distinct CN profiles in varying proportions. As such, we model each tumor sample as a mixture of multiple CN profiles with unknown proportions, where the read count data are given by a negative binomial model. We derive an expectation maximization algorithm to infer the CN clones, their proportions and the assignment of each cell to one of the CN clones in each tumor sample. Details of the model and testing/validation process are provided in Supplementary Methods.

We modified our previously published method ConDoR19 to make it scalable to our dataset, which had cases with over 10,000 single cells as all samples from the same patient were merged. The modifications required for scalability are described in the Supplementary Methods. The updated method fast-ConDoR takes the following as input: (1) variant and total read counts of mutation (SNPs or SNVs) in each cell, (2) CN clustering of cells into distinct CN clones and (3) annotation of the mutations into two groups—germline SNPs and somatic SNVs. The annotation of mutations is required because, while SNVs are somatic mutations that may be gained or lost during cancer evolution, SNPs are germline mutations that are affected only by LOH events.

We obtained the annotation of the mutation measured from snDNA-seq data by comparing them with mutations derived from bulk-sequencing data of matched normal and tumor samples. Because homozygous SNPs are not informative for cancer phylogeny inference, mutations with pseudobulk VAF of >0.9 in snDNA-seq were filtered out. Upon testing fast-ConDoR, we found a set of loci recurrently called as LOH in non-neoplastic clones (that is, cells without driver mutations such as KRAS and TP53) in multiple patients, likely arising due to artifactual allelic imbalance at corresponding amplicons caused by PCR. These loci were manually selected and filtered out.

Fast-ConDoR produces a tree where the leaves represent the sequenced cells and the edges indicate gain or loss of SNVs and SNPs. To avoid overfitting the data, we merge CN clones with low proportions (that is, comprising <0.1% total cells) and do not have any SNVs. This was implemented because, based on observation of our samples, such clones always had only likely false-positive LOHs called, thus could not be confirmed. We assign SNV and CN states to each internal vertex using the Sankoff algorithm. Then, the branch length of each edge in the phylogeny is calculated by combining the difference between the SNV and CN states of the source vertex u and target vertex v of the edge using the formula below. CNV(v) is a vector that describes the copy number states of the vertex v; Nsomatic is the number of somatic SNVs, and NLOH is the number of LOHs that occurred on the edge. p1, p2 and p3 are normalization factors arbitrarily set to 100/3, 100/3 and 0.5, mostly for illustration purpose.

Because we designed our panel to target only genes critical to pancreatic cancer development and progression, we considered all functional mutations (nonsynonymous, intron, etc.) detected by this panel to be driver events.

Based on the pancreatic cancer genetic progression model and our observation of the inferred phylogenies, none of which had two early-diverging tumor branches, we simply define the trunk to be the first edge that has a somatic SNV event when traversing the tree in preorder. For PC22 and PC24, which do not have somatic SNVs covered by our panel, their trunk could be trivially found by hand.

Statistical comparison of KRAS mutation sc-VAF distribution between early-stage and late-stage PDACs was performed using a linear mixed-effects model (statsmodels v0.14.4 in Python), with a random intercept for each sample to account for repeated measurements. The fixed effect of stage (early versus late) was tested for a one-sided alternative hypothesis (mean of late stage > mean of early stage, that is, the estimated effect size >0). The estimated effect size was \({\hat{\beta}}\) = 0.13 (s.e. = 0.08), with a one-sided P value of 0.054. To compare the BRCA biallelic inactivation probability between germline BRCA2 mutation cases (6/6) and other cases (2/18), Fisher's exact test was used to test the hypothesis that there is no association between gBRCA status and BRCA2 biallelic inactivation.

Tesla is offering passengers robotaxi rides in Austin without a human safety driver in the front seat.

CEO Elon Musk on Thursday posted on X, his social media platform: “Just started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car. Congrats to the Tesla AI team!” 

He then made a recruitment pitch for engineers interested in “solving real-world AI,” which he says will “likely lead to AGI” to join the Tesla AI team. 

The automaker launched its robotaxis in the Texas city last June in a limited deployment with a safety operator in the front passenger seat. Tesla initially offered those first rides to influencers and handpicked customers. In December, Tesla began testing its robotaxis in Austin without a safety driver in the front seat — a precaution in case the vehicle needs a human to take over.

Not all of Tesla's fleet in Austin will be fully driverless. Per Tesla's AI lead Ashok Elluswamy, the company will be “starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.”

Tesla is charging for the rides, according to one rider who posted on X. There also appears to be a chase car following the driverless vehicles. 

Some of Tesla's rivals, like Zoox and Waymo, did not immediately charge for driverless rides upon initial deployment.

TechCrunch has attempted to reach out to Tesla for clarification. 

The article has been updated to reflect new information, including that Tesla is charging for the rides.

400 MHz higher boost clock for $30 sounds like a good bargain.

AMD's Ryzen 7 9850X3D, a contender for the best CPU, will hit retail for $499 on January 29. This highly anticipated Zen 5 3D V-Cache chip aims to dethrone the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, arguably the fastest gaming processor ever created.

The Ryzen 7 9850X3D holds no surprises as we've known about it for a while now, but that doesn't diminish its appeal. The gaming processor is a meticulously higher-binned variant of the award-winning Ryzen 7 9800X3D. It features a substantial 400 MHz boost clock advantage over its predecessor, which should translate into up to a 7% improvement in games, according to AMD. Naturally, you should wait for some real-world benchmarks for a true performance verdict.

The chipmaker wasn't shy about targeting Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K, the flagship of the Core Ultra 200S (codenamed Arrow Lake) series. AMD claims the Ryzen 7 9850X3D demolishes the Core Ultra 9 285K by up to 27% in gaming. It's a testament to AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, which continues to dominate in gaming scenarios and maintains a significant performance gap that Intel hasn't been able to close.

The persistent DRAM shortage continues to wreak havoc in the memory market. The swiftly rising prices on DDR5 and DDR4 memory kits have forced enthusiasts to make difficult compromises when planning their builds or upgrading their existing systems. However, AMD offers a silver lining for prospective Ryzen 7 9850X3D buyers. Apparently, you won't need to break the bank on premium memory. AMD reassures customers that pairing the Ryzen 7 9850X3D with budget-friendly DDR5 memory won't compromise gaming performance.

The second-generation 3D V-Cache technology is AMD's secret weapon for the memory performance equation. According to the chipmaker's internal tests on over 30 games, the framerate difference between DDR5-4800 and DDR5-6000 was less than 1%. That means you can use a run-of-the-mill Crucial DDR5-4800 C40 32GB (2x16), the most affordable DDR5 memory kit on the market right now, for $251.92, and still enjoy exceptional gaming performance. This is welcome news for existing AM5 platform owners looking to drop in a Ryzen 7 9850X3D upgrade without replacing their current memory, and first-time builders assembling a new high-end gaming system.

While the official Ryzen 7 9850X3D launch date is still over a week away on January 29, eager enthusiasts don't have to wait to secure their chip. You can already buy it on Amazon for $499 to lock in your purchase and expect delivery in the first weeks of February, but waiting for benchmarks and real-world testing is normally advisable in this scenario.

Karius' return to football



Loris Karius is making a comeback after the Champions League final in Kyiv, which marked the end of his Liverpool career. Loris Karius currently plays for FC Schalke 04, who are fighting to earn promotion to the Bundesliga, the top tier of German football. He has regained his starting spot on this team and could lead this historic German club back to the top flight.







Mistakes that marked his career

The German goalkeeper managed to reinvent his confidence and his career as well. “In my mind, I was retired.” I didn't do anything for seven months. It sounds dramatic, but I was practically retired,” he confesses to The Independent.

Karius made two crucial errors during the match against Real Madrid: the first was a mistake that Benzema converted into a goal, and the second was the third goal, which came from a long-range shot by Gareth Bale, marking Real Madrid's third goal and sealing their victory, ultimately leading to his replacement by Alisson.

A new opportunity

After being released from the Liverpool team at the age of 29, Karius considered retirement and, with no offers from any club, took a seven-month break.

Eight years later, in the German second division, with 19 starts as the first-choice goalkeeper, he could win over a club's fans once again. The German helped the historic German club fight their way from relegation to the third division to the top of the second division.

Will Loris Karius be able to restore this team to its former glory and his own at the same time?

					By Mike Fleming Jr 

Editor-At-Large


EXCLUSIVE: Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar nomination Thursday morning for One Battle After Another puts him in such rarefied air that before our eyes he's transforming from the actor of his generation to one of the most accomplished actors ever.


	This marks the eighth overall nomination for DiCaprio, who won Best Actor for The Revenant. It puts him in the company of eight other actors to be nominated for at least seven Oscars, a group that includes Ingrid Bergman, Jeff Bridges, Richard Burton, Robert Duvall, Jane Fonda, Greer Garson, Dustin Hoffman and DiCaprio's Titanic costar Kate Winslet.

	











	His six Best Actor nominations tie him with Burton and Daniel Day-Lewis for most all time.

	DiCaprio spoke this morning with Deadline. As usual, his focus was not on himself but rather his Oscar-nominated castmates on One Battle After Another and writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson. It was also about the reminder that sometimes when you take risks and swing for the fences from your heels, you hit home runs.


	While Warner Bros leaders Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy were unfairly shackled with risks taken on One Battle After Another and Sinners, they are looking pretty smart today: those films got a total of 29 nominations at a time when specialty labels and not studios rule the awards circuit.


One Battle After Another's release has been a momentum builder, transitioning from theaters to streaming at an optimal time. I tell DiCaprio this is a movie that lends itself better than many to repeat viewings, where you can focus on different performances, action, and great dialogue each time.


	“That is the ultimate compliment for this film,” DiCaprio told Deadline. “Having watched the film that way a multitude of times myself, I feel it's a testament to the incredible amount of thought that Paul put into this story. When films take on a different meaning or a different pathos, you feel you can take a side road into any of these small characters' lives because they are all so fully fulfilled and hashed out with real identities. To me, it really is original filmmaking and a really multifaceted world, about a subject that is so pertinent to the world we're living in, and the confusion of the world we're living in, and the hostility and the extremism. Paul made one of those films that I'm going to be so proud to look back. I feel like he really put his thumb on the pulse of America right now. I hope it will be remembered that way, and lives on for years to come. And it's all a testament to Paul's writing and what he wanted to say about who we are right now.”

	











	There are only five nominations in each Oscar category except Best Picture, and somebody's going to be left out. DiCaprio, Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn and Teyana Taylor all got nods. Acting in her first major feature, Chase Infiniti did not.  


	“Chase was the heart and soul of this movie,” DiCaprio said. “And she's going to have an incredible career ahead of her. She really carried this film, especially it being her first role in a feature film. I couldn't have been more proud of her and the integrity and the intensity and the leadership that she brought to that character. As for the others, what can I say? I got to work with an all-star cast. I was incredibly fortunate to work with so many people that I've looked up to for years in this industry, and it was an incredible experience.


	“To work on this film with Paul and just to collaborate on a film that just feels so topical, man, it's unbelievable,” DiCaprio said. “It has been so cool to be a part of this band, when you go out in the world and are able to talk about a film that you're truly proud of. With actors that you're so proud to work with and a story that you feel is important. We've been doing it for the past year, and there's an ease to talking about something that you have such a genuine love and pride for. And that's how I feel about this movie.”

	I tell him that it seems only a matter of time that the Academy Museum comes knocking for the bathrobe DiCaprio's Bob Ferguson character wears for the entire film, and the karate pants Del Toro wore throughout.


	“I guess they'll come for those, and that tracking device,” he said, adding that he doesn't have any of that stuff. “When I make a movie, I always look at the props and wonder, what might be the memorable symbol of some of these films? And I guess you nailed it.”


	Unlike like his Killers of the Flower Moon co-star Robert De Niro, DiCaprio doesn't have the hoarder gene and couldn't remember anything special he took from the job. So no, the bathrobe isn't hanging in his closet.


	“It's gotten harder to get those props out of the studios, man. They go right into the vault. I can't think of anything I have that is that memorable. Bob, he keeps everything.”


	DiCaprio will next star with Jennifer Lawrence in the Martin Scorsese-directed What Happens at Night, as Michael Mann continues work on Heat 2, the crime classic sequel. Last time Deadline spoke with DiCaprio, he was weighing whether to play Vincent Hanna (the role originated by Al Pacino) or Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) and their continuing adventures.


	I tried to pry out details on that and his Golden Globes viral moment, and he shut down like the door of a studio prop vault.


	“On Heat 2, we're keeping that one tight,” he said.


	As for his animated Golden Globes moment that went viral to the point lip readers were speculating on who he was speaking to, and whether the subject was KPop Demon Hunters? He felt no need to elaborate.


	“It was directed to a friend, but at the end of the day, who knows if this other person that I was talking to wants me to even mention their name? So, as the lead character says in A Bronx Tale, I'm not a rat.”

The nominations for the 98th Annual Academy Awards were announced live Thursday, January 22, with press, publicists, and other guests gathering at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in the very early hours of the morning. Attendees were still sleepy as the ceremony began — on the dot, at 5:30 a.m. — but there was also a palpable excitement in the air for Phase Two of awards season to kick off, and to finally find out what films made the final cut in what has been a particularly competitive Oscar race.

Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor kicked off the ceremony with a brief speech thanking the audience, both in person and those watching the livestream, while providing a preamble that gestured at the ongoing conversations about the role of AI in film.

“This year, the Oscars celebrate our humanity, our connection with each other, and remind us once again that the world is made up of individual stories that have the power to unite us through narratives that speak to the emotions we all share,” she said. “We live in a time of limitless technology that enables us to push the boundaries of our cinematic experience, and our profound belief is that the heartbeat of film is, and will always remain, unmistakably human.”

 










That last line earned applause from the in-person audience, keying up the main event perfectly: Former Best Supporting Actress nominee Danielle Brooks and “The Testament of Ann Lee” star Lewis Pullman started reading the esteemed names and titles, and a clear crowd favorite soon emerged: 

“Sinners,” Ryan Coogler's Southern horror blockbuster about a Black community in a small town haunted by vampires, cleaned up, breaking the record with 16 total nominations. The film got the biggest and most excited reaction by far among the small sample crowd assembled, with huge cheers for every single nomination it pulled — especially Michael B. Jordan's Best Actor nod and its inclusion in the very first Best Casting lineup.

“Sinners” also gave nomination morning one of the most delightful surprises, when on-the-bubble contender Delroy Lindo, who plays pianist Delta Slim, made his way into the Best Supporting Actor lineup. Beating out the presumptive fifth-man, Paul Mescal for “Hamnet,” Lindo's long-awaited first Oscar nom sparked massive applause. 

On the opposite end of the surprise scale, but clearly a film that had its fans present, was “KPop Demon Hunters,” which received a huge reaction for its very expected Best Animated Feature and Best Song (for “Golden”) nods.

 










Other unexpected nominations elicited more shock mixed with excitement. The crowd reacted with audible gasps when “F1,” which had only emerged as a contender very recently after being included in the PGA nominations, was announced as the second Best Picture contender in the 10-film field. 

Kate Hudson's surprise entry in the Best Actress field, for the Neil Diamond jukebox musical “Song Sung Blue,” was met with cheers but also some evident astonishment, as did Elle Fanning's inclusion in Best Supporting Actress for “Sentimental Value,” the very first nomination announced. And Oliver Laxe's rave drama “Sirāt,” which over-performed in the shortlists, was greeted with delight when it made the Best International Feature and Best Sound categories.

The 98th Annual Academy Awards will be held Sunday, March 15 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. After his acclaimed performance last year, comedian Conan O'Brien will return to host the show for a second year. The ceremony will air live on ABC and stream on Hulu.
