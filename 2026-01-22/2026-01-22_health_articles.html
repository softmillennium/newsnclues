                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new medical large language model (LLM) achieved over 91 percent accuracy in identifying female participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder after analyzing a short WhatsApp audio recording where participants described their week, according to a study published January 21, 2026 in the open-access journal PLOS Mental Health by Victor H. O. Otani, from Santa Casa de São Paulo School of Medical Sciences and Infinity Doctors Inc., Brazil, and colleagues. Major depressive disorder is a mental health condition that affects over 280 million people globally, and early detection can be critical for timely treatment. Here, Otani and colleagues used machine learning models to classify individuals with and without major depressive disorder based on WhatsApp voice messages. The authors used two 2 datasets for this study, a dataset to train their LLMs (with 7 different sub-models used) and then a dataset to test their LLMs. The dataset used to test the trained models consisted of 74 participants: 33 outpatients (17 women, 16 men) diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 41 control group participants (21 women, 20 men) with no depression diagnoses. All participants were provided informed consent and screened to exclude potential confounding factors such as other medical issues. In the training dataset, outpatient speech data was taken from WhatsApp audio recordings sent to their doctor's offices when they were symptomatic; control group participants chose their own routine WhatsApp audio voice messages to share. All audio messages in both datasets were from native Brazilian Portuguese speakers. The LLMs showed greater accuracy when classifying women compared to men as depressed VS not-depressed, particularly when given the "describe your week" data, with an accuracy rate of 91.9 percent for the highest-performing model. (This may potentially be explained by the higher number of women participants in the model training dataset, as well as differences in speech patterns between men and women.) The authors are hopeful that continued refinement of their models could produce a low-cost and practical way to screen individuals for depression, as well as other potential clinical/research applications. Our study shows that subtle acoustic patterns in spontaneous WhatsApp voice messages can help identify depressive profiles with surprising accuracy using machine learning. This opens a promising path for low-burden, real-world digital screening tools that respect people's daily communication habits."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the world's most extensive birth cohorts is now entering later adulthood. At the University of Oulu in Finland, the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966) is launching a major new follow-up combining decades of biological, social, and environmental data with modern digital health tools to examine how lifelong exposures and the genome shape health and aging. This is a long-term follow-up study with exceptionally comprehensive life course data, spanning more than six decades. Few studies globally combine such long follow-up with biological samples, clinical examinations, survey data, national health registers, and now also digital health measurements. Finland offers a uniquely valuable setting for long-term population research due to its relatively homogeneous population, comprehensive healthcare registers, and high-quality longitudinal data, enabling accurate tracking of health and social outcomes over time. During its long history, the NFBC1966 study has demonstrated how health is shaped by a complex interplay of social, environmental, biological, and behavioural factors across the life course. Now, as participants reach 60 years of age, the study is broadening its focus on understanding aging, its early signs, and how early-life conditions predict health in later life. In Finland, the proportion of people aged over 75 is expected to double within the next 25 years, a trend mirrored across Europe and many other regions. Professor Sylvain Sebert, Scientific Director of the NFBC1966 study, emphasizes that aging is a natural and continuous process. By drawing on decades of cohort data, the NFBC1966 study aims to identify factors that promote resilience and reduce the risk of chronic disease. Around the age of 60, it appears that humans are reaching a cornerstone point where many aging-related processes begin to emerge. It is essential to collect detailed information before these changes fully take hold, as many chronic conditions – such as cancers, dementia and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and kidney diseases – become more common at this stage. Studying people before these changes fully emerge is essential if we want to understand how healthy aging can be supported from both a personal and healthcare system perspective.” These tools enable continuous, objective monitoring of daily functioning, physical activity, sleep, and recovery – capturing aspects of health that clinical visits alone cannot. Combining clinical visits with digital tools gives us a much fuller picture of health across the life course”, Professor Sebert says. By providing these technologies to participants, NFBC1966 offers a model for how digital tools can be integrated into healthcare systems inclusively. As NFBC1966 enters its seventh decade, it is increasingly shaped by international and multidisciplinary collaboration. The unique longitudinal design of NFBC1966 provides researchers worldwide with valuable insights into how health, aging, and their determinants evolve across the life course.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chemotherapy commonly damages the intestinal lining, a well-known side effect. But this injury does not remain confined to the gut. It reshapes nutrient availability for intestinal bacteria, forcing the microbiota to adapt. Rather than acting locally, IPA functions as a systemic messenger. Elevated IPA levels reprogram myelopoiesis, reducing the generation of immunosuppressive monocytes that facilitate immune evasion and metastatic growth. We were surprised by how a side effect often seen as collateral damage of chemotherapy can trigger such a structured systemic response. By reshaping the gut microbiota, chemotherapy sets off a cascade of events that rewires immunity and makes the body less permissive to metastasis." Clinical relevance is supported by patient data obtained in collaboration with Dr Thibaud Koessler (Geneva University Hospitals, HUG). In patients with colorectal cancer, higher circulating IPA levels following chemotherapy are associated with reduced monocyte levels, a feature of improved survival outcomes. By uncovering a functional axis linking the gut, the bone marrow and metastatic sites, we highlight systemic mechanisms that could be harnessed to durably limit metastatic progression." says Tatiana Petrova, corresponding author of the study. An ISREC Foundation Tandem Grant supported close collaboration between clinical and fundamental research, led at Unil by Professor Tatiana Petrova and Dr Thibaud Koessler at HUG. The project posits that chemotherapy can induce a form of biological "memory", mediated by gut microbiome–derived metabolites that durably inhibit metastatic growth. Together, these findings reveal a previously underappreciated gut–bone marrow–liver metastasis axis through which chemotherapy can exert durable systemic effects, opening new avenues to harness microbiota-derived metabolites as adjuvant strategies to limit metastasis. Chemotherapy-driven intestinal dysbiosis and indole-3-propionic acid rewire myelopoiesis to promote a metastasis-refractory state.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Overuse of antibiotics has accelerated the development of bacterial resistance to conventional drugs, a global health crisis projected to result in more than 10 million deaths annually by 2050. The multidrug-resistant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounts for approximately one-fifth of hospital-acquired pneumonia cases and is associated with severe illness and increased mortality. Nitric oxide is a therapeutic gas that researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, helped establish as a life-saving therapy for hundreds of thousands of newborns with congenital heart disease. Nearly 30 years later, investigators from the same laboratory at Mass General Brigham report that high-dose inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) demonstrates potential antimicrobial activity in preclinical models and is safe and feasible in early human studies, supporting further clinical investigation. The findings are published in Science Translational Medicine. Our findings demonstrate strong preclinical antipseudomonal effects together with reassuring human safety data." Binglan Yu, PhD, first author, Mass General Brigham Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine "These results justify the careful design of phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials to formally assess clinical efficacy," added co-first author Bijan Safaee Fakhr, MD, also of the MGB Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine. To assess feasibility and safety in humans, the investigators evaluated repeated high-dose iNO exposure in 10 healthy volunteers and two critically ill patients affected by multidrug-resistant bacterial infection. The treatment was well tolerated, with no serious safety concerns observed. A retrospective analysis of patients who received high-dose iNO in clinical settings, mostly during the COVID-19 pandemic, further supported the safety profile of this approach. "These results suggest a promising strategy that could complement existing treatments," said senior author Lorenzo Berra, MD, of the MGB Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, its Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that an enzyme involved in protein translation is essential for circulating immune cells, called monocytes, to mature into tissue-resident macrophages, a specialized population of immune cells that maintain organ health by clearing dead cells and debris. Without this enzyme, monocytes enter tissues but fail to fully differentiate, leading to impaired tissue maintenance and persistent immune cell infiltration that causes inflammation instead of repair. Using a series of mouse models, the investigators, led by Erika Pearce, Ph.D., Bloomberg Distinguished Professor in the Department of Oncology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, demonstrated that DHPS controls a core, tissue-agnostic program that enables macrophages to adhere to their local environment, interact with surrounding cells and carry out the essential functions that maintain tissue balance and organ health. Tissue resident macrophages are critical for tissue homeostasis, such as clearing out dead cells, repairing damage and maintaining balance in organs. Tissue-resident macrophages form during embryonic development and typically self-renew locally. However, during injury or cell loss, bone-marrow-derived monocytes are recruited into tissues and must differentiate into mature macrophages to restore the normal, healthy population of macrophages. The study found that when DHPS was deleted in myeloid cells, macrophages were present in tissues but lacked the defining features and functions of mature tissue-resident macrophages. As a result, tissue and organs experienced an ongoing influx of immature immune cells that failed to restore normal macrophage populations. "They could enter tissues, but without DHPS they couldn't become the right kind of macrophage needed to maintain and repair those tissues." Analyses of gene activity, protein production and protein-making machinery revealed that DHPS is required for efficient translation of a subset of genes involved in cell adhesion (the ability to stick to their surroundings and to other cells so they can stay in the correct place and function properly), signaling, and tissue interaction. Imaging studies showed that DHPS-deficient macrophages had abnormal shape and positioning within tissues, while functional assays demonstrated defects in the clearance of dead cells and tissue maintenance. "Because tissue-resident macrophages play roles in cancer, wound healing, fibrosis and inflammatory diseases, this pathway could be relevant across a wide range of diseases, as well as in aging, where inflammation and impaired tissue repair are common," says Daniel Puleston, Ph.D., assistant professor of immunology and immunotherapy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and a co-senior author on the paper. By linking metabolic control of protein translation to immune cell differentiation and tissue stability, the study provides a unifying mechanism for how monocytes become long-living, functional tissue-resident macrophages. The authors note that understanding this pathway has implications for aging, inflammatory disease and therapies that aim to target macrophages across tissues, where restoring or modulating macrophage function could influence long-term tissue health. Next steps, they say, will focus on identifying the full set of DHPS-dependent proteins and determining how this pathway influences macrophage behavior in specific diseases, where promoting tissue repair or limiting inflammation may require different therapies. "This is a very fundamental pathway for these cells," Pearce says. "Understanding when and where macrophages depend on this process, and when it might be beneficial to enhance or inhibit, is an important next step." In addition to Carrizo, Puleston and Pearce, other researchers participating in the study are Pianpian Lin, Seung Hyun Lee, Kevin Shenderov, Camille Blerlot, Minsun Cha, Lena Schimmelpfennig, Zhen Shen, Nikki van Teijlingen Bakker, Katarzyna Grzes, Beth Kelly, Niloufar Safinia, Kate Schole, Yaarub Musa, Gerhard Mittler, Yoh Zen, Edward Pearce, Florent Ginhoux and David Sanin. The transition from monocyte to tissue-resident macrophage requires DHPS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Having an ischemic stroke during pregnancy or three months after pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events like heart attack or second stroke, heart disease and depression later in life. The study also found that female participants who had a stroke during pregnancy or postpartum were less likely to be employed and more likely to be retired at the end of the study compared to those who did not have a stroke. The study does not prove that stroke causes these health and employment effects. Our study sought to better understand what happens to women after a stroke during pregnancy and postpartum and found an increased risk of cardiac diseases and depression, as well as lower odds of being employed later." Anna Richardt, MD, study author, University of Helsinki, Finland For the study, researchers identified 97 female participants in Finnish health care registries who had an ischemic stroke during pregnancy or postpartum, up to three months after pregnancy. They were matched to 280 female participants who did not have a stroke. Researchers tracked the health of each person through registries and medical records for an average of 12 years, noting which participants later had cardiovascular events like heart attack, stroke and heart disease or depression. Of participants with an initial stroke, 6% had a second stroke and 7% had a major cardiovascular event like heart attack compared to 0% of those who were stroke free at the start of the study. Researchers also found among participants with stroke, 9% had cardiac disease, including atrial fibrillation or congestive heart failure, compared to 1% of those who did not have stroke. After adjusting for age, participants with stroke had a nearly nine times greater odds of having cardiac disease. After adjusting for age, those with stroke had nearly four times greater odds of having depression. After adjusting for age, researchers found that participants with stroke had 45% lower odds of being employed and nearly five times greater odds of being retired at the end of the study compared to those without stroke. "Of those with stroke, 92% had good functional outcomes, meaning they had either completely recovered or could manage most daily activities by the end of the study," said Richardt. Our findings highlight the need for adequate stroke prevention, monitoring and rehabilitation to improve the long-term health for those who have stroke during pregnancy." A limitation of the study was the small number of participants with stroke since stroke during pregnancy is rare.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid a surprisingly severe flu season and a Covid-19 resurgence, those highly contagious respiratory illnesses are drawing the largest share of media coverage and public attention. But it is also the season for another respiratory illness, respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, and RSV cases are "elevated in many areas of the country," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). RSV data for the week of Jan. 5, 2026, show an increase both in emergency department visits and hospital admissions for children up to age four, according to CIDRAP, the Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy, at the University of Minnesota. And the Pan American Health Organization issued a Jan. 10 epidemiological alert warning RSV activity "is showing a gradual upward trend," which, combined with flu cases, "could further strain health systems." RSV, a common respiratory illness, usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but is the leading cause of hospitalization among infants in the United States. Most RSV infections go away on their own, but RSV can be severe, especially for babies, young children, and older adults. The CDC estimates that more than 100,000 older Americans are hospitalized annually with RSV, as well as 58,000 or more infants and young children. Beginning in 2023, the CDC recommended RSV immunization for newborns and infants – either through a maternal RSV vaccine given to those who are pregnant during their 32nd-36th weeks or through a monoclonal antibody injection given to newborns and infants born during RSV season, typically October through March. On Jan. 5, 2026, after this survey was conducted, U.S. health authorities cut the number of regular childhood vaccinations to 11 from 17. As a non-vaccine antibody product, RSV immunization is not part of this count, although health officials presented it as a tool that was also now being reserved for high-risk groups. An HHS spokesman, however, told the Washington Post that these high-risk groups include all otherwise healthy children whose mothers were not vaccinated against RSV during pregnancy. This effectively means the RSV guidelines did not change for newborns: Either those who are pregnant should be vaccinated during their pregnancy or their infants should get the monoclonal antibody injection. The CDC also recommends the antibody injection for certain young children (ages 8 to 19 months) who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease. The vaccine for older adults: The survey finds that a majority of adults (56%) are aware there is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccine against RSV for older adults, up from 42% in October 2023, only months after CDC first recommended this treatment, in May 2023. In the current survey, 38% say there is an FDA-approved vaccine against RSV for pregnant people to protect their infants, up from 12% in August 2023. However, the percentage familiar with this vaccine was eight points higher in September 2024 at 46%, so the current figure represents a recent decline. A majority of Americans say they would be likely to recommend the RSV vaccine for older adults and those who are pregnant and the monoclonal antibody injection for infants, as the CDC has recommended: It's important for OB-GYNs, pediatricians, and public health officials to communicate the value of these immunizations."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The up-to-five-year, $7.45 million award supports a project called "Quantitative Assessment of Thoracic Duct Obstruction," part of ARPA-H's Lymphatic Imaging, Genomics and Phenotyping Technologies program, which seeks to better understand and diagnose lymphatic disease. Led by Sabee Molloi, professor of radiological sciences, and co-investigator Cholsoon Jang, assistant professor of biological chemistry, the School of Medicine team is developing a safer, noninvasive way to assess lymphatic fluid flow, a process that has long been difficult to measure. The researchers are working on an advanced imaging approach that uses CT scans to track lymphatic flow, paired with blood-based markers that offer additional clues about how the lymphatic system is functioning. Together, the tools could give physicians a clearer picture of problems that are often missed or diagnosed late. The project focuses on thoracic duct obstruction, a condition that can disrupt the body's ability to move lymph fluid and is linked to serious health problems such as chronic abdominal pain, fluid buildup and nutritional deficiencies. Because symptoms can be vague and imaging options are limited, many patients go years without clear answers. Later phases will involve patient studies aimed at bringing the technology into clinical use. "Our aim is to bridge the gap between innovation and patient care," Jang said. If successful, the approach could help doctors choose the most appropriate protocol for each patient, whether that means monitoring symptoms, adjusting treatment plans or pursuing minimally invasive procedures, ultimately improving outcomes for people living with lymphatic disorders. The ARPA-H LIGHT program is focused on advancing new technologies that shed light on the lymphatic system, which remains largely unexplored despite its importance to human health.
