The Thursday, January 22, episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills will feature new cast member Rachel Zoe hosting a psychic soirée for the cast, which has us reminiscing about another iconic psychic moment from the show.

Back on Season 1 in 2010, Kyle Richards, who is still a member of the RHOBH cast, attended a dinner party at Camille Grammer‘s house, and Allison DuBois, a medium, was present. DuBois made a shocking prediction about Richards' relationship with Mauricio Umansky, and it ended up coming to fruition.

BroadwayWorld spoke to Cher Álvarez about the upcoming production of Paranoma Activity at Shakespeare Theatre Company, running January 28th through February 7th, 2026. This North American premiere from celebrated playwright Levi Holloway (Broadway's Grey House) and Punchdrunk's Felix Barrett (Sleep No More) features illusions by Tony Award-winner Chris Fisher (Stranger Things: The First Shadow, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child). Lou entered my life in a time of acceptance. And her will to fight for the truth, to unveil the darkness and finally confront it for the sake of her healing, it felt incredibly inspiring to me. There was a drive, a need, to not only survive anymore but to live and the quest as to how the hell do we go about doing that. How do you relate to your character Lou on a personal level? Definitely the love that she chooses to give. When immersed in this world you almost feel the timer, the ticking that's relentless but also keeping time. And I believe that has everything to do with it being horror. Fear/terror affects us all so distinctly where time really feels alternate. And Lou is really doing her best to keep time. The production has been described as suspenseful and scary, how do you prepare mentally for each performance? And each day I'll find myself in a different headspace so it's nice to have a little bit of everything. To release her back into the space, a proper check out. And the unwinding is being learned to become slower. Check in with myself, reflect and feel all the feelings. How was your experience working with award-winning illusion designer, Chris Fisher? Chris and I have only ever interacted virtually; however, the brilliance behind that man's creativity is absolutely bonkers, and to say that I'm honored is an understatement. I mean genuinely a team member that is supportive and incredibly faithful to his craft. Why must audiences come and see the show? Like we are actually living in a time of so much confusion, risk, fear. And so much of it we have such little control over. Really, for me at least, what I'm gathering and experiencing is being honest with myself. And I strongly believe now more than ever is a calling to be just that with yourself; honest.

The writer-producer announced her debut sci-fi novel, "Obscura," which promises to hook fans from the very first page. According to Variety, Tucker's debut novel centers on the question of whether everything that was seen as make-believe and fairy tales is actually true. "The island of Obscura is famed for its beaches, drugs, and hedonistic clubs. Amy Einhorn at Crown (Penguin Random House) commented Tucker's book immediately had her "dazzled" reading the first page, and calls it "a ride like no other." Tucker reveals that her debut novel was a story she had wanted to tell for decades, inspired by her "counterculture childhood" growing up among artists in Ibiza, and her love of world-building and magical realism. She wrote for the first two seasons of Supernatural before joining Alan Ball for the vampire seriesTrue Blood. For True Blood, she also rose to become an executive producer in 2013 after having produced six seasons of the series. For Netflix, she wrote and executive-produced season two of Jessica Jones.

Her work captures the intersection of entertainment and real-world experiences. There's been a whole bunch of chatter online regarding the famous British it-couple, David and Victoria, along with their four children; Brooklyn, 26, Romeo, 23, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 14. Now, rumours of an alleged family fall-out between the couple and their eldest, Brooklyn, have been brewing for years now but everything came to a head on Monday (19 January) when he took to Instagram to share a series of bombshell claims about 'Brand Beckham' and how his parents have reportedly impacted his relationship with his wife Nicola Peltz, with whom he tied the knot back in 2022. Fellow celebs, ex-partners, fans and critics alike have been sharing their two cents on the matter, including a 'psychic' who made quite the eerie family prediction about the family-of-six weeks before Brooklyn released his statements, which referenced wedding dress speculation and Brooklyn and Nicola's first dance drama. Earlier this month (3 January), Mamamia's 'resident psychic', Evelyn Santoro, told the outlet a little more about her thoughts on the 'Beckham family succession'. "By June 2026, the Nicola Peltz–Victoria Beckham dynamic doesn't explode. Here we'll see two strong brands refusing to bend. But there will be strained peace through separation, not resolution." Evelyn claimed that, by August 2026, Victoria will hit 'fashion fatigue'. "And the empire shows visible strain," she continued. "David and Victoria: legacy protectors; Brooklyn and Nicola: separate power unit; Romeo and Cruz: the flexible duo; Harper: shielded from cameras," she noted, adding: "This is the real succession story; the Beckham's transition from one family brand to multiple orbiting ones. Now, just because a so-called psychic 'predicted' such events doesn't necessarily mean they are bound to happen, but internet sleuths will no doubt find the timings interesting. In his statement, which was delivered across six text posts on his Instagram Stories, Brooklyn claimed: "Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed." He added: "I do not want to reconcile with my family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into. "Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. LADbible Media Group has previously reached out to David and Victoria Beckham's representatives for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers found evidence that dark matter and neutrinos may interact, hinting at a "fundamental breakthrough" that challenges our understanding of how the universe evolved. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Those two elusive components — dark matter and neutrinos (or "ghost particles") — are ubiquitous throughout the cosmos, yet they remain poorly understood. This surprising interaction may help to explain why the universe is less populated by dense regions, like galaxies, than predicted — in other words, the universe is less "clumpy" than cosmologists think it should be, the researchers said in a statement. Neutrinos are subatomic particles with infinitesimally low masses and no electric charge, so they very rarely interact with other particles. They're produced by various nuclear processes, including stellar fusion and supernovas, in prodigious quantities: Every second, approximately 100 billion neutrinos pass through each square centimeter of your body, Live Science previously reported. Yet dark matter and neutrinos should not interact, according to the leading model of cosmology, known as the lambda cold dark matter model (lambda-CDM). However, this recent study provides new evidence that dark matter and neutrinos may interact after all, as other researchers have posited over the past two decades. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. If dark matter and neutrinos do collide, and transfer momentum to one another in the process, this discovery would inspire a rethink of the lambda-CDM model. "Our study shows that interactions between dark matter and neutrinos could help explain this difference, offering new insight into how structure formed in the Universe." "The statement that cosmic structures are 'less clumped' is best understood in a statistical sense, rather than as a change in the appearance of individual galaxies or clusters. It refers to a reduced efficiency in the growth of cosmic structures over time," study co-author William Giarè, a cosmologist at the University of Hawaii, told Live Science via email. The later-universe data come from the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a two-decade effort to create a 3D map of millions of galaxies across more than 11 billion light-years. Cosmic shear is the distortion of distant celestial objects due to weak gravitational lensing, which occurs when massive foreground structures bend the fabric of space-time and alter the paths of light traveling from those distant celestial objects to our detectors. When accounting for collisions between dark matter and neutrinos and the resulting momentum exchange, the simulations generated a model universe that better agrees with real observations. —Heaviest antimatter particle ever discovered could hold secrets to our universe's origins —Astronomers propose making a neutrino detector out of the Pacific Ocean Though short of the scientific gold standard of 5 sigma, it is significant enough to warrant additional research because, if confirmed, the interaction would prove a "fundamental breakthrough in cosmology and particle physics" — and a potential solution to the cosmic clumpiness quandary. "The final verdict will come from upcoming large sky surveys, such as those from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and more precise theoretical work," research team leader Sebastian Trojanowski, a theoretical physicist at the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Poland, explained in a separate statement. "These will allow us to determine whether we are witnessing a new discovery in the dark sector or whether our cosmological models require further adjustment. Zu, L., Giarè, W., Zhang, C. et al.

It often goes hand in hand that people both believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life and that the government is trying to cover it up, which is why secret military bases like Area 51 have built up such mythos. Alien hunters are dedicated to their belief that there's life out there, often visiting the most common UFO sighting spots and delving deep into the current so-called evidence of alien life throughout history. If it is true that the 'truth' is being obscured by major governments, then there's little that the average person can do. But people might have received a hint that something major could be announced in the near future. Relayed by Douglas Macgregor on X, a former senior analyst in financial security at the Bank of England, Helen McCaw has urged her former employer and Andrew Bailey, the bank's current governor, to 'organize contingencies' if this jaw-dropping reveal occurs. Of course, this isn't strictly a confirmation that an announcement is on the way – as even if you take it at face value, it's merely a means of preparing for all eventualities to reduce risk – but many have taken it as further proof that there's more going on than we might be led to believe. "It would be a small reaction at most," predicts one investor on X, qualifying that "if there's an alien invasion, then markets crash, yes." Another noted that "even hypothetical disclosures can move markets. They'll do anything to take attention away from the Epstein/Trump files," writes one commenter, with another speculating that "those Epstein files must be really, really bad." They concluded: “After a few days of being in the headlines it will just be another normal ho hum item in the news feeds." There are arguably few bigger and more shocking news stories than confirmation of extraterrestrial life, yet who knows if something even bigger is around the corner, considering current trends.</p>

It's an area that's already saturated with excellent options from well-established brands with huge research and marketing budgets, and a customer base that tends to stay loyal to brands they've used in the past. There are relatively recent success stories like Hoka and On, who have both broken through to become major running brands with innovative designs. Both brands used visually striking shoes to stand out on the market too, and that's a playbook that R.A.D seems to have adopted with its first dedicated running shoe. It's very cushioned and comfortable, but still light and springy enough for faster runs, making it a versatile option for your training. R.A.D did launch the R-1 hybrid training shoe last year, which worked for runs as well as gym workouts, but the UFO is purely aimed at runners, and indeed built to rival the best running shoes on the market with a high price tag of $200. When the UFO landed on my doorstep I was skeptical. There are very few shoes that are as soft and springy as the UFO, and for R.A.D to have developed such impressive midsole foams in its first true running shoe is remarkable. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. Its combination of cushioning and bounce in a light design make the UFO enjoyable for all kinds of runs at different paces — it's a great do-it-all option for runners who don't use a running shoe rotation. Having run over 40 miles in the shoe in exclusively wet conditions — that's the British winter for you — I can confirm that the grip is reliable even when running at faster paces. The UFO is bouncy and pretty light, but the very wide sections at the heel and forefoot mean that you feel its size during runs at faster paces. I enjoyed using it for tempo runs, but for faster interval runs I prefer a nimbler shoe that's both lighter and narrower, like the Asics Megablast. A bigger barrier to people buying and using the UFO might well be its looks. While many will love the distinctive design, many runners might well prefer to use a more normal-looking running shoe. I'd say it works for R.A.D to make a shoe that looks so different as a debut, but I'd be keen to see a more traditional-looking sneaker that uses this excellent midsole foam in the future.
