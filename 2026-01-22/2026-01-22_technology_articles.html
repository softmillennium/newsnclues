                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CEO Elon Musk on Thursday posted on X, his social media platform: “Just started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car. He then made a recruitment pitch for engineers interested in “solving real-world AI,” which he says will “likely lead to AGI” to join the Tesla AI team. Tesla initially offered those first rides to influencers and handpicked customers. Not all of Tesla's fleet in Austin will be fully driverless. Per Tesla's AI lead Ashok Elluswamy, the company will be “starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.” Tesla is charging for the rides, according to one rider who posted on X. There also appears to be a chase car following the driverless vehicles. Some of Tesla's rivals, like Zoox and Waymo, did not immediately charge for driverless rides upon initial deployment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Sun-observing probe was there to watch it unfold, gathering unprecedented data that's helping scientists better understand the mechanism behind solar flares. Using the European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter spacecraft, a team of scientists discovered that solar flares are triggered by initially weak disturbances that grow more violent, similar to avalanches on snowy mountains. The process creates a sky of raining plasma blobs that continue to fall even after the solar flare has subsided, according to a new study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics. Solar flares are giant explosions on the Sun, flinging energy, light, and particles into space. They take place when energy that's stored in twisted magnetic field lines is suddenly released. The most powerful solar flares can disrupt technologies on Earth, triggering geomagnetic storms capable of causing radio blackouts. Scientists have observed solar flares for years, but they still lack a detailed understanding of how this colossal amount of energy is released so rapidly from the Sun. Each strand was magnetically contained and twisted like a rope. The region became progressively less stable, just like in an avalanche. The twisted magnetic field strands began to break and reconnect, rapidly triggering a cascade of further instability in the region. As the strands broke, they triggered progressively stronger reconnection events and outflows of energy, which appeared as increasing brightness in the images. Then, a sudden brightening was followed by the dark filament disconnecting from one side, launching into space while violently unrolling at high speed. “We were really very lucky to witness the precursor events of this large flare in such beautiful detail,” Pradeep Chitta, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen, Germany, and lead author of the paper, said in a statement. “Such detailed high-cadence observations of a flare are not possible all the time because of the limited observational windows and because data like these take up so much memory space on the spacecraft's onboard computer. The scientists behind the study were surprised to learn that the large flare is driven by a series of smaller reconnection events that spread rapidly in space and time, creating a cascade of increasingly violent events. “These streams of ‘raining plasma blobs' are signatures of energy deposition, which get stronger and stronger as the flare progresses.” “Solar Orbiter's observations unveil the central engine of a flare and emphasise the crucial role of an avalanche-like magnetic energy release mechanism at work,” Miho Janvier, ESA's Solar Orbiter co-project scientist, said in a statement. “An interesting prospect is whether this mechanism happens in all flares, and on other flaring stars.” Scientists observed the most active solar region in decades for a record-breaking 94 days. And as Airbus reminded us last week, we're not ready. The region has unleashed at least two powerful solar flares in the last 12 hours, and experts are certain there's more to come. The clingy planet orbits so close to its star, it triggers powerful explosions of radiation that eat away at its atmosphere.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. Vancouver, B.C.-based General Fusion plans to merge with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. III in a transaction that could close by the middle of this year, making it one of the first fusion companies to go public. “We are completely focused on the future,” Megan Wilson, chief strategy officer for General Fusion, told GeekWire. “The path of any innovative company is not always linear.” Wilson said they explored various funding options, including a traditional IPO, but appreciated Spring Valley's experience and track record in creating publicly traded companies. The deal with General Fusion includes $230 million from the SPAC's trust, presuming no redemptions, as well as a $100 million private investment in public equity, or PIPE. The 115-person company previously raised a total of $400 million from investors, industry partners and government grants. California-based TAE has a $6 billion planned merger with Trump Media & Technology Group, the publicly traded parent company of the social media platform Truth Social. With the merger and new funding, TAE said that it's aiming to site and begin building a utility-scale fusion plant this year. But they're all reporting progress toward that goal, with TAE and Washington's Helion Energy working on commercial facilities. General Fusion, which launched in 2002, is currently operating its Lawson Machine 26, a magnetized targeted fusion demonstration device that's about half the size of its planned commercial‑scale machine. That includes reaching 100 million degrees Celsius — a target it had earlier set for last year — and achieving the conditions needed to create fusion reactions that produce excess energy. “This transaction with Spring Valley positions us with the capital we need to be able to continue operating the Lawson Machine 26 as we pursue really transformative technical milestones that will ultimately put us on a path to the first-of-a-kind plant,” Wilson said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Waymo robotaxis can now be hailed by the public in Miami. Once accepted, riders will be able to hail a robotaxi within a 60-square-mile service area in Miami that covers neighborhoods such as the Design District, Wynwood, Brickell, and Coral Gables. Waymo said it plans to eventually expand to Miami International Airport, but didn't provide a timeline beyond that it was coming “soon.” As the company continued to expand in those metro areas — pushing into the larger Bay Area and into Silicon Valley, for example — it also opened in new markets. Those plans include Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Nashville, London, San Diego, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The company has already started testing in some of those cities using a mix of its all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles and newer Zeekr RT vans that have been rebranded “Ojai.” Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last October that “by the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week.” It has also gotten the attention of federal safety regulators. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened an initial investigation into the company last October over how its robotaxis operated around a stopped school bus in Atlanta. The company has issued a voluntary software recall to fix that issue. However, new videos, which show Waymos illegally passing school buses, suggest the problem has not been resolved.

One person can remotely manage an entire site of working vehicles. Founded in 2021 and led by longtime engineers, AIM raised $50 million last year from investors including Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst, Human Capital. The company is led by CEO Adam Sadilek, who previously spent nine years at Google working on confidential projects. In a LinkedIn post this week, Sadilek wrote that “we're asking the wrong questions about AI and work,” arguing that automation will enable construction companies to build more with their existing teams. “For example, each autonomous dozer we deploy uncovers, depending on the mineral type and current market price, between $3 million and $17 million in additional ore each season. And yes, cost savings show up – fuel, maintenance, wear – but they're not the main event.” He added: “Instead of focusing on whether AI removes jobs, we should be focusing on whether we'll use it to finally do more of the things we've always wanted but never had enough capacity to build.” GeekWire Studios has partnered with AWS for the Guide to re:Invent.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. This highly anticipated Zen 5 3D V-Cache chip aims to dethrone the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, arguably the fastest gaming processor ever created. The Ryzen 7 9850X3D holds no surprises as we've known about it for a while now, but that doesn't diminish its appeal. It features a substantial 400 MHz boost clock advantage over its predecessor, which should translate into up to a 7% improvement in games, according to AMD. The swiftly rising prices on DDR5 and DDR4 memory kits have forced enthusiasts to make difficult compromises when planning their builds or upgrading their existing systems. However, AMD offers a silver lining for prospective Ryzen 7 9850X3D buyers. Apparently, you won't need to break the bank on premium memory. AMD reassures customers that pairing the Ryzen 7 9850X3D with budget-friendly DDR5 memory won't compromise gaming performance. That means you can use a run-of-the-mill Crucial DDR5-4800 C40 32GB (2x16), the most affordable DDR5 memory kit on the market right now, for $251.92, and still enjoy exceptional gaming performance. This is welcome news for existing AM5 platform owners looking to drop in a Ryzen 7 9850X3D upgrade without replacing their current memory, and first-time builders assembling a new high-end gaming system. While the official Ryzen 7 9850X3D launch date is still over a week away on January 29, eager enthusiasts don't have to wait to secure their chip. You can already buy it on Amazon for $499 to lock in your purchase and expect delivery in the first weeks of February, but waiting for benchmarks and real-world testing is normally advisable in this scenario.

If you're a Star Wars fan looking to bring a piece of the galaxy far, far away home, LEGO's Star Wars collection has plenty to love and explore. It features a range of building sets (starships, vehicles, locations), minifigures, and more for those who want to recreate the iconic moments, while also appreciating the finer details. These sets usually start at around $50 and go past $100 for larger builds. If you're shopping for one today, you're in luck because Amazon has dropped the price of the 25th Anniversary Edition Millennium Falcon set by 20%. This is the lowest we have seen it drop in a long while, but as you'd expect, the offer is only around for a short time. This set is part of a collectible series featuring mid-scale buildable models of iconic Star Wars starships, and comes together in 921 pieces. It's not going to be one of those quick projects you can finish in a few hours, but it's also not so overwhelming that it requires a full week of attention. It can be a fun weekend project where you rewatch a favorite movie from the series while building the ship. It also includes a LEGO Star Wars 25th anniversary brick to celebrate the event. It's designed to be displayed at a dynamic angle, as if it's in flight during a battle, or just carrying Luke Skywalker across the galaxy. It's quite easy to follow for fans of all ages, but if you need more assistance, you can download the LEGO Builder app. The latter offers 3D instructions where you can zoom in on each step from every angle. You can also save progress and build with friends on the app. On a regular day, this LEGO set will cost you around $85, but you can now grab it for $68 at Amazon. That said, now is a great time to grab some other sets from the range to create a fuller, more complete setup, as we're spotting quite a few other options going for less, too.

Legislators from the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee this week advanced the AI Overwatch Act, originally introduced in December, which would give ultimate control over the exports of high-performance data center-grade AI processors to adversary nations to Congress. As reported by Reuters, the bill advanced after the White House introduced its new export rules for fairly advanced AI GPUs from AMD and Nvidia to China, along with a mechanism to get a 25% fee from the exporters. The AI Overwatch Act belongs to the same legislative family as the SAFE Chips Act introduced in early December, designed to curb shipments of advanced AI processors to adversary nations, such as China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, but it does so in a different way. The new bill codifies existing performance limitations that allow AMD and Nvidia to ship their H20 and MI308 processors to entities in adversary nations that are not specifically blacklisted by the U.S. government without an export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security. However, everything that offers higher performance would not only be subjected to export controls by the DoC but would also require approvals from Congress, which would have veto power, under the new proposals. In addition, if passed, the legislation will terminate existing licenses, impose a temporary blanket denial until a new national security strategy is submitted, and subject any future approvals to 30-day congressional review. One interesting thing that the bill introduces is that under the AI Overwatch Act, a trusted U.S. person may deploy and operate advanced, otherwise restricted AI GPUs abroad without certain export licenses, provided the hardware remains under U.S. ownership and control, is not placed in a country of concern, and meets strict security, ownership, and audit requirements. For now, AMD, Nvidia, and others can sell high-end AI accelerators and servers to all countries except countries of concern without any restrictions. That is set to continue with the AI Overwatch. However, the trusted U.S. person framework is meant to governs ongoing control of AI compute beyond a one-time legal sale.

Although I like the model, I don't like the leadership of that company and how close it is, how divisive they're in terms of politics. I still have a small Claude account to do some code reviews. Opus 4.5 does good reviews but at this point GLM 4.7 usually can do the same code reviews.If cost is an issue (for me it is, I pay out of pocket) go with GLM 4.7 China would need an architectural breakthrough to leap American labs given the huge compute disparity. A financial jackknifing of the AI industry seems to be one very plausible outcome as these promises/expectations of the AI companies starts meeting reality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even before winning reelection, President Donald Trump and his supporters put immigration at the center of their messaging. The Trump administration has since poured billions of dollars into immigration enforcement, and in March, Trump issued an executive order requiring the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that states have “access to appropriate systems for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered.” In May, DHS began encouraging states to check their voter rolls against immigration data with the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program, run by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Experts have warned that using disparate sources of data—all collected for different purposes–could lead to errors, including identifying US citizens as noncitizens. “Eligible US citizen voters will be wrongfully purged from voter rolls based on inaccurate data from the illegally overhauled SAVE system,” says Nikhel Sus, deputy chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which is counsel for the plaintiffs in the case. On May 22, DHS announced a “partnership” with the SSA and rolled out SAVE as a tool that state and local governments could use for voter verification. But in doing so, the complaint argues, some of these states are already disenfranchising eligible voters. One of those, Anthony Nel, is, in fact, a US citizen. According to the complaint, SAVE identified Nel as a noncitizen “based on outdated data, leading to his voter registration being wrongfully canceled in December 2025.” In response to a request for comment, Texas assistant secretary of state for communications Alicia Pierce referred WIRED to the October press release where the state announced the findings from its use of SAVE. “We're talking about a known error rate that will result—and already has resulted—in multiple people being kicked off the voter rolls, going into a critical election,” says John Davisson, director of litigation and senior counsel at EPIC, which is one of the plaintiffs in the case. “It's a burden that lawfully registered voters shouldn't have to bear,” says Davisson. Research has shown that instances of noncitizens voting are extremely rare. Trump and his supporters have spent years spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories about the integrity of US elections, making it a focal point of the right-wing media ecosystem. “Just by identifying potential noncitizen voters through SAVE, regardless of whether they actually are noncitizens, this false narrative will be further fueled,” says Sus. “There is a broader concern about sowing distrust in the integrity of our election results.” The complaint argues, “DHS and SSA lack any statutory or constitutional authority to transform SAVE into a national data bank to conduct citizenship checks for purposes of determining individuals' eligibility to vote in elections.” It argues that the inclusion of social security data not only introduced potential inaccuracies but effectively transformed SAVE into something else—a citizenship database. A privacy threshold analysis (PTA) conducted by USCIS, which was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the plaintiffs and has been reviewed by WIRED, warns that USCIS knew that “shortfalls in data accuracy in the system could cause incomplete or false results,” even as DHS was encouraging states to use the tool. The PTA marked SAVE as “not in compliance” with privacy regulations, in part because it had not yet issued a system of records notice, the legal notice required to inform the public that social security data was being shared for immigration purposes. “Social Security numbers were never intended for this use case,” says Dudek. “The records of Social Security are for the discreet and explicit purposes of old age survivors, disability insurance, and Social Security insurance.” Social Security numbers are issued to people legally allowed to work in the US and do not change once someone naturalizes. Immigration and naturalization processes are managed by DHS, and naturalized citizens are not required to tell SSA if they naturalize, meaning SSA data may be out of date. (In March 2025, SSA suspended a program that automatically mailed Social Security cards to newly naturalized citizens and people authorized to work in the US, requiring instead that they physically appear at one of the agency's regional offices. Dudek says the new SAVE tool was likely not fit to be rolled out for voter identification. “It needed to be rolled out in a way that was thoughtful,” he says. “Congress has provided no specific statutory authorization for the Department of Homeland Security to create a national citizenship data bank to look up any American's citizenship status,” Sus says. “DHS is effectively imposing a backdoor, federal documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement for voters whose citizenship SAVE can't confirm. Not only will this needlessly burden the voting rights of US citizens, but it undermines Congress' choice to not adopt a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement for voting.” As the midterms inch closer, other government systems are being proposed to further tamp down on voting access. Congress is considering a SAVE Act that would require proof of citizenship to vote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an exclusive interview, the AI pioneer shares his plans for his new Paris-based company, AMI Labs. He believes that the industry's current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems. Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. He is also a staunch advocate for open-source AI and criticizes the closed approach of frontier labs like OpenAI and Anthropic. Perhaps it's no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company's influential research lab that he founded. Meta has struggled to gain much traction with its open-source AI model Llama and has seen internal shake-ups, including the controversial acquisition of ScaleAI. LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas. You've just announced a new company, Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI). Tell me about the big ideas behind it. It is going to be a global company, but headquartered in Paris. You pronounce it “ami”—it means “friend” in French. There is a very high concentration of talent in Europe, but it is not always given a proper environment to flourish. And there is certainly a huge demand from the industry and governments for a credible frontier AI company that is neither Chinese nor American. So an ambitious alternative to the US-China binary we currently have. What made you want to pursue that third path? Well, there are sovereignty issues for a lot of countries, and they want some control over AI. What I'm advocating is that AI is going to become a platform, and most platforms tend to become open-source. I think that is a strategic mistake. It's certainly true for OpenAI, which went from very open to very closed, and Anthropic has always been closed. Google was sort of a little open. My sense is that it's not going in a positive direction at this moment. Simultaneously, China has completely embraced this open approach. So all leading open-source AI platforms are Chinese, and the result is that academia and startups, outside of the US, have basically embraced Chinese models. There's nothing wrong with that—you know, Chinese models are good. But you know, if there is a future in which all of our information diet is being mediated by AI assistance, and the choice is either English-speaking models produced by proprietary companies always close to the US or Chinese models which may be open-source but need to be fine-tuned so that they answer questions about Tiananmen Square in 1989—you know, it's not a very pleasant and engaging future. You need high diversity of assistance for the same reason that you need high diversity of press. How are investors buying that idea so far? They don't have the means to train their own model, and it's kind of dangerous for them strategically to embrace a proprietary model. What's your view on the company and Mark Zuckerberg's leadership? There's a perception that Meta has fumbled its AI advantage. I think FAIR [LeCun's lab at Meta] was extremely successful in the research part. Where Meta was less successful is in picking up on that research and pushing it into practical technology and products. I may not have agreed with all of them. For example, the robotics group at FAIR was let go, which I think was a strategic mistake. But I'm not the director of FAIR. People make decisions rationally, and there's no reason to be upset. Could Meta be a future client for AMI? The work we are doing is not in direct competition. Our focus on world models for the physical world is very different from their focus on generative AI and LLMs. You were working on AI long before LLMs became a mainstream approach. But since ChatGPT broke out, LLMs have become almost synonymous with AI. Yes, and we are going to change that. But the latest ones of those are not pure LLMs. They are LLM plus a lot of things, like perception systems and code that solves particular problems. So we are going to see LLMs as kind of the orchestrator in systems, a little bit. Beyond LLMs, there is a lot of AI that is behind the scenes that runs a big chunk of our society. There are assistance driving programs in a car, quick-turn MRI images, algorithms that drive social media—that's all AI. You have been vocal in arguing that LLMs can only get us so far. Do you think LLMs are overhyped these days? There is a sense in which they have not been overhyped, which is that they are extremely useful to a lot of people, particularly if you write text, do research, or write code. But people have had this illusion, or delusion, that it is a matter of time until we can scale them up to having human-level intelligence, and that is simply false. This is the Moravec Paradox (a phenomenon observed by the computer scientist Hans Moravec in 1988): What's easy for us, like perception and navigation, is hard for computers, and vice versa. LLMs are limited to the discrete world of text. They can't predict the consequences of their actions. We are going to have AI systems that have humanlike and human-level intelligence, but they're  not going to be built on LLMs, and it's not going to happen next year or two years from now. And that is what I've been working on. And this company, AMI Labs, is focusing on the next generation. And your solution is world models and JEPA architecture (JEPA, or “joint embedding predictive architecture,” is a learning framework that trains AI models to understand the world, created by LeCun while he was at Meta). If you try to build a generative model that predicts every detail of the future, it will fail. It is a system that learns to represent videos really well. The lack of non-text data has been a problem in taking AI systems further in understanding the physical world. What other kinds of data will you be using? Our systems will be trained on video, audio, and sensor data of all kinds—not just text. We are working with various modalities, from the position of a robot arm to lidar data to audio. I'm also involved in a project using JEPA to model complex physical and clinical phenomena. What are some of the concrete, real-world applications you envision for world models? There is no technique right now to build a complete, holistic model of these systems. A world model could learn this from the sensor data and predict how the system will behave. This is what will finally make agentic systems reliable. An agentic system that is supposed to take actions in the world cannot work reliably unless it has a world model to predict the consequences of its actions. Without it, the system will inevitably make mistakes. Humanoid robots are all the rage recently, especially ones built by companies from China. There are all these brute-force ways to get around the limitations of learning systems, which require inordinate amounts of training data to do anything. So the secret of all the companies getting robots to do kung fu or dance is they are all planned in advance. You need an enormous amount of tele-operation training data for every single task, and when the environment changes a little bit, it doesn't generalize very well. What this tells us is we are missing something very big. The reason why a 17-year-old can learn to drive in 20 hours is because they already know a lot about how the world behaves. If we want a generally useful domestic robot, we need systems to have a kind of good understanding of the physical world. That's not going to happen until we have good world models and planning. There's a growing sentiment that it's becoming harder to do foundational AI research in academia because of the massive computing resources required. Do you think the most important innovations will now come from industry? LLMs are now technology development, not research. It's true that it's very difficult for academics to play an important role there because of the requirements for computation, data access, and engineering support. It's not something academia should even be interested in. What academia should be working on is long-term objectives that go beyond the capabilities of current systems. That's why I tell people in universities: Don't work on LLMs. The breakthroughs are not going to come from scaling up LLMs. That research paper started the whole revolution. Academia needs access to computing resources, but they should be focused on the next big thing, not on refining the last one. You wear many hats: professor, researcher, educator, public thinker … Now you just took on a new one. What is that going to look like for you? I am going to keep my position at NYU. But I go to Paris pretty often because of my lab. Well, there's two ways to be hands-on. This is not my mission in life. It's really to make science and technology progress as far as we can, inspire other people to work on things that are interesting, and then contribute to those things. So that has been my role at Meta for the last seven years. I founded FAIR and led it for four to five years. I kind of hated being a director. I am not good at this career management thing. I'm much more visionary and a scientist. What makes Alex LeBrun the right fit? Alex is a serial entrepreneur; he's built three successful AI companies. He then left to create Nabla, a very successful company in the health-care space. When I offered him the chance to join me in this effort, he accepted almost immediately. Where else do you plan to have offices? There's going to be an office in North America. We don't have any issue recruiting. There are a lot of people in the AI research community who think the future of AI is in world models. Those people, regardless of pay package, will be motivated to come work for us because they believe in the technological future we are building. We've already recruited people from places like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and xAI. I heard that Saining Xie, a prominent researcher from NYU and Google DeepMind, might be joining you as chief scientist. I have a lot of admiration for him. I hired him at FAIR, and I convinced my colleagues at NYU that we should hire him there. Let's just say I have a lot of respect for him. When will you be ready to share more details about AMI Labs, like financial backing or other core members? Four ways to think about this year's reckoning. Our AI writers make their big bets for the coming year—here are five hot trends to watch. By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Glancing through the content it made me wonder if the newly launched Claude Cowork had a Show HN / Ask HN skill on launch ... I attributed this to macroeconomic climate, and found some (shaky) evidence of voting rings based on the topics that had a unusually high likelihood of gaining 10 points and an unusually low likelihood of reaching  100 points given that they reached 10.Analysis here if anyone is interested: https://blog.sturdystatistics.com/posts/show_hn/ > Nearly every AI related topic does worse once it clears the 10 point threshold than any other category. This is very possible, but from my interaction with this crowd from my posts, these users tend to be more technically minded (think DIY hardware, rather than landing-page builders).Last visual in the following section: https://blog.sturdystatistics.com/posts/show_hn/#digging-int...It's good to know that this would be helpful. My tendency would be to dig in a bit more into the individual examples that fall into this more suspicious bucket before presenting this evidence formally, but curious if you think these high level results are sufficiently helpful?

I'm not even remotely equipped to judge the veracity of your work, but they are, and that you care at all is, like, 0.000001%. Take the plunge and write them a note (or simply link them your comment thread here with a one sentence FYI email!). There are likely to be a number of possible explanations for this that offset the lower average score. Perhaps we are also seeing higher standards—a project that used to take 6 weeks and a ton of conviction now wraps up in a few hours, and people are resetting their expectations. The submissions that actually get upvoted are indeed pretty good. Standards are whatever, since it's clear that a lot of these submissions are close to one-shot (and even when they would have required some refinement, people don't actually push a meaningful commit history) with an obnoxious LLM house style promotional README.Often the submission also comes across LLM-generated, including heavy use of Markdown formatting. It gives the impression that people learn that HN is a place to promote themselves, but don't realize how blatantly obvious it is that they didn't actually do anything significant beyond thinking of something for Claude to do[1] and don't care about learning how the site works. [1] I'm not claiming that work done with coding agents will always be blatantly obvious. I'm claiming that this is the default result for people who don't put in any effort, and lack of effort correlates with lack of understanding.

It's not uncommon to see people showing off their website traffic graph on Twitter after hitting HN. You can also find people asking for advice on how to use HN to market their shitty SaaS on places like reddit.Another kind of marketing you see quite often is people replying with a post that starts off reasonable, until the third paragraph where the commentator says "this is why we built blah" and makes you feel you are staring at an half eaten Apple with half a worm in it.

Whenever I see the word "influencer," my brain automatically substitutes "unemployed." AI may be the largest bubble yet in history, and it has the ability to sustain itself directly via online hype-bots.tulips can't specifically target all of your replies and explain why you're a cunt and should buy more even among hackers, we see a very naive and superficial understanding. hacker news current structure makes no sense when consensus can be fabricated (automated karma farming + targeted "collective action" is cheap, people have already realized this and soon will become intolerant). people will still urge for care and passion, discovery, interesting ideas. people will urge for a way to separate a vibed nothing-project, valued at 25 Claude sonnet prompts, in response to the latest Simon wilinson new hot take in 35 minutes. hacker news current structure makes no sense when consensus can be fabricated (automated karma farming + targeted "collective action" is cheap, people have already realized this and soon will become intolerant). people will still urge for care and passion, discovery, interesting ideas. people will urge for a way to separate a vibed nothing-project, valued at 25 Claude sonnet prompts, in response to the latest Simon wilinson new hot take in 35 minutes. it is the equivalent of showing your support flag and pronouns in 2020.if at any time people start using this information to filter out content, they'll hide it immediately.nobody has your satisfaction as a high priority you know if at any time people start using this information to filter out content, they'll hide it immediately.nobody has your satisfaction as a high priority you know nobody has your satisfaction as a high priority you know Seems like there should be a restriction on greenies (from posting) until they've lurked more, here. No project should ever be "overlooked" due to the use of AI coding tools.The only valid reason for a project failing to get solid exposure on HN is that there is not much substance to it (some combination of thought, effort, ingenuity, usefulness). The only valid reason for a project failing to get solid exposure on HN is that there is not much substance to it (some combination of thought, effort, ingenuity, usefulness). I mean no offense by this, but intuition literally means acquiring knowledge without an explanation. I suspect for some of the non-engaging posts it's just throwing it out there, inexperience or part of the product hunt playbook Currently /new shows 5 "Show HN"s, which are also visible on /shownew.> but I really don't see the value in using the Show HN: prefix.You get a lot more traffic over a longer period of time, but best of all, the users who engage with you are in a different mindset for the "Show HN" posts.On a normal submission, you get a whole range of top-level posts that are mostly tangible related to the topic at hand. Completely different mood and input, that is much more about what you're actually sharing, than a submission.That's my experience of "Show HN" at least, YMMV. > but I really don't see the value in using the Show HN: prefix.You get a lot more traffic over a longer period of time, but best of all, the users who engage with you are in a different mindset for the "Show HN" posts.On a normal submission, you get a whole range of top-level posts that are mostly tangible related to the topic at hand.

That said, many Show HNs do make it to top with less votes than the tiny few I got organically, so maybe I tripped some HN's filters? But if I post again, it'll be without the Show HN.

I think the frontpage is both a lot harder to get into, faster to get dropped from there, but obviously also has a lot more traffic. But the traffic from Show HN frontpage seems to engage more (again probably because of the mindset) and it stays there for a lot longer.Personally, when I want feedback about the idea and implementation, I'd go for Show HN, because you're out after comments and discussions then, not just traffic and views. But if traffic/views are what you care about, regular submission would do "better". But if traffic/views are what you care about, regular submission would do "better". I think there's a minimum threshold of interest that's required before people start engaging. But it could also be that my submission was super boring, or there was something else off-putting about it – I'd be surprised if it was the latter, because the HN audience isn't known for holding back on criticism. Since deciding on such path I think I actually moved closer to something that may be useful to others (but I'm still staying on that path for now).I don't know any online tool which would provide me which mine does, and frankly the reality nowadays seems that it could take me more to find one if it existed (testing along all those which does not quite fit, which I did), than creating a version custom tailored for myself. I don't know any online tool which would provide me which mine does, and frankly the reality nowadays seems that it could take me more to find one if it existed (testing along all those which does not quite fit, which I did), than creating a version custom tailored for myself. For instance counting a project number of contributors, number of commits, age of the project... Not that any of those metrics are good indicators or are hard to game, of course, but that could help triage good faith attempts from shallow LLM vomit.For the record, nobody's denying how useful LLMs are, but let's also acknowledge that they excel at things that have a lot of prior art, so by definition not really a good fit for show HN any more (in the past it may have been; But what was interresting in vibe coding has never been the end result but that it was possible at all, like a dancing bear.)

The fact that it's all genAI stuff puts me off, but that might not be the same for everyone.I think crucially, if I wanted to do this kind of challenge, I would have a better experience just using an LLM chat directly, like “Generate me an image, then judge my description of it in <language>, and give me useful language learning hints according to my level of <level>” I think crucially, if I wanted to do this kind of challenge, I would have a better experience just using an LLM chat directly, like “Generate me an image, then judge my description of it in <language>, and give me useful language learning hints according to my level of <level>” I get this both on iOS Safari and macOS Firefox. On iOS, the page also crashed at some point with the 'a problem repeatedly occured on <url>' message.Looking at it closer, seems like it's a Flutter web app, so I suppose this is to be expected and the experience is probably indeed better on the iOS/android builds, might be that I was judging too quickly.

Not disagreeing on that, but often this can be explained when someone lacks time. For some articles I can only skim over the top some comments; articles with like +30 comments I can barely read all and the article, so I focus just on the first page or so.> using AI that people are fatigued from itI think some accounts here are actually AI accounts. I'm afraid there is no solution to botting without excluding most of the Internet from a given website. With the decline in blogs, Twitter circling the toilet bowl, and facebook etc becoming a wasteland - I did wonder if some people have nowhere to post things. That being said, I sometimes write projects with AI to get feedback fast and prototyping for my own personal use cases and share it here sometimesBut since the community doesn't show support in some cases, I move on with anything new which catches my curiosity/troubles me and build it againI open source most of the stuff but I know that its probably gonna get lost in a sea of AI slop & mine might not be better (I just ask LLM bots to create a simple main.go file to solve X and usually much of my simple projects end up being around 600 loc)I do feel like personal computing or making projects in domains you aren't familiar in to prototype just out of curiosity/your own pragramatic use case is probably what I feel like but long term, there should be a focus on actually transitioning from AI slop to something real if anyone plans to monetize something imo But since the community doesn't show support in some cases, I move on with anything new which catches my curiosity/troubles me and build it againI open source most of the stuff but I know that its probably gonna get lost in a sea of AI slop & mine might not be better (I just ask LLM bots to create a simple main.go file to solve X and usually much of my simple projects end up being around 600 loc)I do feel like personal computing or making projects in domains you aren't familiar in to prototype just out of curiosity/your own pragramatic use case is probably what I feel like but long term, there should be a focus on actually transitioning from AI slop to something real if anyone plans to monetize something imo I open source most of the stuff but I know that its probably gonna get lost in a sea of AI slop & mine might not be better (I just ask LLM bots to create a simple main.go file to solve X and usually much of my simple projects end up being around 600 loc)I do feel like personal computing or making projects in domains you aren't familiar in to prototype just out of curiosity/your own pragramatic use case is probably what I feel like but long term, there should be a focus on actually transitioning from AI slop to something real if anyone plans to monetize something imo I do feel like personal computing or making projects in domains you aren't familiar in to prototype just out of curiosity/your own pragramatic use case is probably what I feel like but long term, there should be a focus on actually transitioning from AI slop to something real if anyone plans to monetize something imo I don't know but I feel like trust is the real bottleneck and I used to be happy about it but nowadays I feel like there is even a sense of distrust within the HN community where earlier I used to believe it was a more tightknit community but right now, with all political developments and bots and AI use itself for comments in HN.I think what's gonna happen is not just that we have to trust somebody but rather we have to trust our trust in them if that hopefully makes sense.We have to trust that we are trusting the right guy in a world where trust feels like being eroded and this is a decently bit of an uphill battleIt's also a community thing imo. People are more likely to trust the trust if others do too, We offload our judgement to others thinking that if they liked it then I am more willing to do so tooSo if your project gets trusted by a community, it can snowball but it needs the earlier momentum which I feel like a lot of projects aren't gonna reach since there's only enough snow (attention/trust for the most part)The biggest question is how to start the snowball effect reasonably.

I have tried to write my thought in another comment in here but the gist of that was suppose that I don't feel excited (comparatively, not by a long margin which is why asking the question in the first place, usually I use it just for prototyping/my own use case purpose) just writing code solely but I am interested in everything else from start to finishWould this be considered substance or not (considering if the idea is still decent lets say)? Or is the project considered more substance if its solely written by human codeBecause I feel like I remember simon's post in here about how he made an independent (I think HTML related tool) in python (iirc) using independent tests and so sort of simon's use cases are how I imagine AI use cases to be (reasonable for the very least)Would you consider this an anamoly (given simon is simon and he's probably the most well known blogger in here) or something repeatable?Or like, I am just curious whats substance is. Because I feel like I can build projects but they end up just being a github repo no explaination and I'd love to polish some off my old projects which are dusty with better substance and probably even share it on HN and if I don't do this, then it will still be partially better to know when I might make a project in future & I can try to keep that in my mind hopefully as well.

At the other (low-substance) end of the spectrum is "lead generation tool" or "resume generator" that was built in 3 hours (and not much works other than a signup page and a link to Product Hunt). You can look down the list of most highly-ever upvoted Show HNs here: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&que...Most things getting 1000+ upvotes and hundreds of comments are high-substance, in that they have a back-story, some kind of deep work and/or ingenuity, and they make a great platform for curious conversation, which is, after all, what HN is for.

Like, not every project should be a show HN and that's okay. One can always create an interesting takeaway from any project and create an article about it and publish it on Hackernews as well.I think what I get the feeling is to find out how original your idea is. If your idea is really original, you can greatly benefit from SHOW HN. )Or would you recommend a seperate place for such instead of Hackernews in this particular context?> Sometimes it's just a case of "we know it when we see it".Yes but isn't this also causing the issue where people think that their projects are great and upload show HN and just with AI the amount of projects have grown so large and the signal ratio has just been shrinked impacting real projects as wellI feel as if the people who Submit show Hn needs to ask themselves internally what they would feel about the project without any bias if the project was randomly viewed by them with 0 upvotes, would they ignore or click and read me or upvote and comment and if the project doesn't fit the sense then to not fill SHOW HN with complete garbage AI slop deployed on lovable or something.

Being on the front page of HN is valuable.You can't downvote submission (or at least I can't) so low quality posts score can't even really be corrected (except flagging I guess, which sometimes feels abused but that's another problem). Like, If we are using AI to build yet another next.js App, then perhaps its me but I personally find it doesn't satisfy my curiosity.I want to see projects be written in niche languages and new languages and AI can be perfect for that. See which language you like the most and each language/idea has their own tradeoffs but just follow what you want and now you are less likely to be stuck.Of course though sometimes I create a python script first (I recently made a code where your png's/jpg's can automatically be updated in a slideshow like thing which I built with a custom youtube screenshot and I watched some lectures, pressed shift A and it can now have slides and I compile them to pdf and built another where I can have a pdf and then I can have a laser tool on pdf's because I love to study with notes where I can draw random things on page like whiteboard and erase them without hurting the text below for understanding._I think converted that python tkinkter gui to fyne golang out of curiosity yesterday and I feel both tools are great fwiwI think my point here is I'd much rather be willing to see some niche projects for ourselves and have it first meaningfully improve our lives & just experiment. I don't know not much for monetary gains but out of curiosity and seeing how far you can and cannot go.Just build things you like/want to exist in any way that you like till AI's so damn subsidized (I don't use any agents, just claude web's free version or aistudio for free, my projects are usually around 600-700locs so I can ask it to regenerate it completely and I am fine with much of it, Perhaps I just follow KISS to its core)You would find it funny but the problem's not in code generation but dependency management etc. atleast to me which is why I love uv scripts a lot but sometimes especially chatgpt doesn't know about uv script feature or hallucinates it hard on their web version so If I am building python applets I would paste uv script's complete docs to the LLM website I would be using.

I recently saw a great library (atcute) that changed my opinion. I think most AI sceptics haven't had this experience. They saw AI slops and set their opinion: AI-generated codes are bad. I can't really blame them, though, because there are so many of AI slops.> anyone who is not incorporating it in some way (workflow or actual end product) is just holding themselves back.It's true. Imagine this was a birdwatching forum and you were arguing that posting LLM generated images of birds allows birdwatchers to work on "watching" birds that they would not have had the time to watch previously, and that this should be celebrated. Resources and education have never been more widely or freely available. One of the biggest lies people tell about LLMs is that they "democratize creativity." The billion dollar proprietary black box service you loaded a prompt into shat out an approximation of a product and maybe at best you tweaked some code (more likely just fed it back in to another LLM. )Yes, you wound up with a finished product of dubious quality that you probably don't even understand and can't discuss in any depth. But it shouldn't surprise anyone that people here - who actually care about the journey and the process rather than simply getting to an MVP as quickly as possible - for the most part aren't going to be impressed and aren't going to care much about it.

Some people do want their food to be made by a chef sometimes even in front of them explaining them everything and the journey to them makes it worth itFor some people, it can be that the food that they buy from a shop nearby in front of them is goodFor some, they want the cooking to be done out of their visible range and just want the food servedAnd the last categories probably the ones who will go to supermarkets to get some chips with 3 months expiry date created in a large factoryHackernews to me feels like its 1 & 2 for me. But they are much more democratizedI don't know, I don't go in hotels that much so I don't know the 1st part and how possible it is but I do go to 2nd category and I go around my local shops and see people make french fries and chat with them and ask how long have they been here and making french fries etc., they are willing to tell you everything.I do feel like "AI slop" is kind of the 2nd category because like I am not only just interested in whether or not this recipe's entirely unique but I am rather interested in everything around it, what infrastructure choices they make and what coding tech stack they used & are they passionate about the project or what did they end up creating the prototype for.the 3rd part is what I despise where think burger king or mcdonald etc. All decisions are bland (think yet another nextjs app).I don't think much of us want HN to be a supermarket or another macD but do we want this to be a cooking show where chefs build the whole recipes to serve us or do we want it to be a lot of neighbourly shops who have friendly people working who will chat with us and we can eat the french fries they make :)(I love the french fries my neighbourhood makes, they are really spicy combine them with spring rolls and some drink or a good yogurt and it feels soo good lol, plus all of this costs less a 1$ or 2$ at most 3$ where I live, I can go and eat without worrying at all about the cost of eating outside usually if picked from the right shops)Although I have never had the opportunity of seeing a chef cook his own dish in such sense but I can imagine that its great & I would like them as well but to me hackiness includes both, them hacking around with recipes to build something nice and the other hacking around with infrastructure like what logo and how close they are to me and even things like pricing imo.I consider the latter to be like much more reachable than the former and to me I don't know how to explain but the idea of hackiness isn't just some clean final product, its also like just building something and gluing things and its messy too. And I love both of them both clean and messy hacking, I just want to know how much an human has been in the loop, where'd they get the idea and what they implemented in etc.I don't know I live in a small city connected to a large city and I feel like I enjoy much more the messy aspects whereas people from large cities are much more likely to want to go to a large hotel for a dine or have a more artisanal taste.So I have seen my fair share of people who want both.Right now, I feel like it honestly depends on how large or small community you feel HN is.If you consider HN to be too large aka you find it less likely to trust projects who get to here in the first place, you would want an artisanal person to build things for hand for you to enjoyBut if you consider HN to be small and there is just this idea of treating each person more individually and just this unwritten rule of law which generates more trust and faith in trying out new options even if they are hacky as long as I can sort of trust them decently and they are still involved in the loop and not completely 100% detached unlike say a large conglomerate franchise imoHonestly I want HN to be a small place and not a large place but I feel like even HN is a large place for me but the problem with completely small places or building one's own is that you don't get visitors at all. We probably need something in between HN and no social media promotions (only via word of mouth) imo.I have been trying to replace HN for quite a while now for something more nicher but still well connected place as well. Honestly have thought multiple times to create an HN alternative with the same UI and everything and same rules but just smaller and probably federated (ironically Gonna have it be vibe coded in single main.go golang :) hosting on a cheap recurring deal netcup server I got) but moderation of >0 people is hard and  getting >0 people interested in a new website is hard as well which is precisely what the main post is about.

And I love both of them both clean and messy hacking, I just want to know how much an human has been in the loop, where'd they get the idea and what they implemented in etc.I don't know I live in a small city connected to a large city and I feel like I enjoy much more the messy aspects whereas people from large cities are much more likely to want to go to a large hotel for a dine or have a more artisanal taste.So I have seen my fair share of people who want both.Right now, I feel like it honestly depends on how large or small community you feel HN is.If you consider HN to be too large aka you find it less likely to trust projects who get to here in the first place, you would want an artisanal person to build things for hand for you to enjoyBut if you consider HN to be small and there is just this idea of treating each person more individually and just this unwritten rule of law which generates more trust and faith in trying out new options even if they are hacky as long as I can sort of trust them decently and they are still involved in the loop and not completely 100% detached unlike say a large conglomerate franchise imoHonestly I want HN to be a small place and not a large place but I feel like even HN is a large place for me but the problem with completely small places or building one's own is that you don't get visitors at all. We probably need something in between HN and no social media promotions (only via word of mouth) imo.I have been trying to replace HN for quite a while now for something more nicher but still well connected place as well. Honestly have thought multiple times to create an HN alternative with the same UI and everything and same rules but just smaller and probably federated (ironically Gonna have it be vibe coded in single main.go golang :) hosting on a cheap recurring deal netcup server I got) but moderation of >0 people is hard and  getting >0 people interested in a new website is hard as well which is precisely what the main post is about.

And I love both of them both clean and messy hacking, I just want to know how much an human has been in the loop, where'd they get the idea and what they implemented in etc.I don't know I live in a small city connected to a large city and I feel like I enjoy much more the messy aspects whereas people from large cities are much more likely to want to go to a large hotel for a dine or have a more artisanal taste.So I have seen my fair share of people who want both.Right now, I feel like it honestly depends on how large or small community you feel HN is.If you consider HN to be too large aka you find it less likely to trust projects who get to here in the first place, you would want an artisanal person to build things for hand for you to enjoyBut if you consider HN to be small and there is just this idea of treating each person more individually and just this unwritten rule of law which generates more trust and faith in trying out new options even if they are hacky as long as I can sort of trust them decently and they are still involved in the loop and not completely 100% detached unlike say a large conglomerate franchise imoHonestly I want HN to be a small place and not a large place but I feel like even HN is a large place for me but the problem with completely small places or building one's own is that you don't get visitors at all.

If you want a chef to explain and show his recipe and then you find out he asked chat gpt or got it from a recipe website, would you still be interested in hearing about the 'journey' he took?If that chef then also ordered the food from a catering service by forwarding that recipe to them, does it make sense to interview him about his craft and listen to him?It's the same with creative things. You could learn something from them, other than 'here's how i asked someone else to make this'.So, going to an art forum and displaying your AI generated art there, ready to answer questions about the process is pretty much completely pointless and also cheapens every actual artist that came there to display and talk about something they actually made.It also has a psychological effect on the people that use it. For a lot of people like that, any incentive to learn about things is gone, because they get the exact same feeling by using AI to make it.On the other hand: If you are an artist making things and there are a million people generating things every 5 minutes and showing it around everywhere, it dilutes recognition of what you made.

Once again if HN is solely for the 1st sector of chefs 100%, then AI use should be completely restricted againstBut if HN falls into what I call the 2nd category too then does it really matter if the local chef's using a recipe built by chatgpt?I completely understand what you are saying man and the psychological effects are real.And this is why I feel like if Hackernews is targetted for people in the 1st category or the 2ndBecause if there is a forum where both local shops who say makes fries which are built in less time and there is also the chef which takes hours building teh perfect food and both of them are on the same forum & they probably get the same space in it then a conflict between them is sort of meant to occur with all the effects which you mention and feels to me like a prisoners dilemma because if artisanal chefs are impacted by local normal cooks lets say then just being a local cook would get stigmatized in a forum. Overall its a net negative for both.But it honestly depends on how negative if the eyeballs come on both, sure they can split and create different forums but neither wants to leave the large one and the large forum owner has had incentives in both artisanal and local cooks (YC funding AI companies and hackernews once being so damn creative that I hear stories about when one day the moderator decided to have the front page be all about erlang/elixir from a story I remember from a HN "veteran")I mean I love em both. It's not an or condition but honestly what I hear in HN is the path of least resistance ie. if you don't like moderation, then make your own place but I do feel like the moderation's atleast a bit confused about their interests too.Probably another reason why I am interested in fediverse because I want it to be like a street where we can have both artisanal chef clubs and the local shops fair while on the same road but a bit of problem with fediverse atleast in this context of HN alike is that lemmy's c/technology can probably replace HN in some contexts but the streets of lemmy are empty because everybody's still here on HN.

If AI is used to manifest the idea then so be it!Secondly, I think it is almost unavoidable to use some ai generated content (code, design etc) when developing these days. Its just a tool and it can be used well or used poorly.Lastly, I agree that there does exist a lot of what can truly be labelled "AI slop" where it is just lazy regurgitated content, and that is annoying.

Lastly, I agree that there does exist a lot of what can truly be labelled "AI slop" where it is just lazy regurgitated content, and that is annoying. I don't care if they are made or not, but i would rather not have those on the internet and especially on 'show and tell' places like ShowHN etc.I'm also not opposed to using AI as a tool in development or similar. But there are more and more examples of purely vibe-coded or generated things and those fall in a different category in my opinion. I'm also not opposed to using AI as a tool in development or similar. But there are more and more examples of purely vibe-coded or generated things and those fall in a different category in my opinion. I am much more interested in infrastructure related things and price optimizing. I've spent hours and days looking at all the options compiling resources and building scrapers to scrape information of servers and having them be made via LLM :) just to get the idea of context.I don't know but like what i possess isn't a deep knowledge within the domain itself (one of the reasons why I love golang is that all the tradeoffs of it are okay with me and it's complexity just feels linear to me and I would have this simplicity in code where if I ever wanted to, I just feel so much more confident about tweaking LLM generated golang code than say rust)A lot of what I love is the hacking around the project. Ooh so you used golang to make it cross compatible easier? I think I am really frugal so like this is like the deepest intersection of like all of my hobbies combined.I face any problem -> use free llm from web -> python/golang code -> deploy it on my web server -> use cloudflare tunnels and custom scripts + zed/others and micro to deploy servers great (I prefer using tmux as well with zed terminal)But even with all of this, I wouldn't say that the code isn't slop but I do feel like its pretty much reasonable and I have been vocal about how if I ever create something and a community actually occurs out of it & they want me to recreate it from scratch without any LLM assistance, I actually would even if that means reading documentations of all the libraries used in such golang project etc.But like the reason why I still do things is because I do it for myself and I am pretty impatient. I build things which trouble me first and foremost to fix issues I have & that's kind of source of joy I have.I don't know man, like I hate AI for all the psychological issues its gonna cause but I still want to build things without having to spend say days in a project when I would be facing the problem right now.I think I have always imagined myself as some consultant who wants to give the best option out there and have the code back and manage it or similar.It's just that writing the code part myself isn't the most exciting part to me. I just am in the middle and I don't know if there's a term for it but like, I don't know if someone knows a term for what I feel about AI it will be brilliant but even if there isn't a mainstream word for it. I have my nuanced opinion and I have thought about joining either of these boxes but being honest neither fits my worldview.Does this make sense?

I build things which trouble me first and foremost to fix issues I have & that's kind of source of joy I have.I don't know man, like I hate AI for all the psychological issues its gonna cause but I still want to build things without having to spend say days in a project when I would be facing the problem right now.I think I have always imagined myself as some consultant who wants to give the best option out there and have the code back and manage it or similar.It's just that writing the code part myself isn't the most exciting part to me. I just am in the middle and I don't know if there's a term for it but like, I don't know if someone knows a term for what I feel about AI it will be brilliant but even if there isn't a mainstream word for it. I have my nuanced opinion and I have thought about joining either of these boxes but being honest neither fits my worldview.Does this make sense?
