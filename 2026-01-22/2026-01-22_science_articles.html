                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Volunteers scouring satellite imagery pinpointed what they thought was evidence of Roman-era marching camps in Germany. On-the-ground investigation confirmed their thinking, leading to the discovery of four previously unknown third-century C.E. camps that show Roman advancement farther north in Germany than otherwise recorded. According to a statement from Germany's State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology Saxony-Anhalt, the four newly uncovered camps include two near Aken and one each at Trabitz and Deersheim, providing “evidence of Roman marching camps for the first time.” With historical records chronicling the movement of Roman troops as far as the Elbe River, there was previously no evidence of a presence in Saxony-Anhalt. Similar infrastructure plans have been seen throughout history. Then in 2023, the team identified another potential site, this near Trabitz, thanks to aerial photos. Potential sites kept popping up, often thanks to remnants of the perfectly straight lines of ditch borders and the camp's rounded corners. To corroborate the aerial clues, large-scale geophysical surveys incorporated metal detectorists. Teams recorded over 1,500 finds, mostly iron objects—the “high number of nails and bolts is striking”—that were once the hobnob nails meant to offer traction on a soldiers' sandals. This marching effort was considered abandoned in 9 C.E., after the adopted son and designated successor of Emperor Augustus fell from his horse and eventually died near Drusus during a retreat from the Saale. That led to the Romans withdrawing and even vacating a town near Lahnau-Waldgirmes. As a result, large Germanic tribes formed, and these tribes clashed with the Romans, sometimes leading to the Roman military moving deeper into Germanic territory. Though the broad strokes of these conflicts have long been known, discoveries like this newly-uncovered marching camp offer up key details that aid in our understanding of the time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists just calculated how many microplastics are in our atmosphere. A new estimate suggests land sources eject 600 quadrillion pieces of microplastic into the atmosphere every year Microplastics travel by air and sea, turning up even in remote areas. Microplastics are pervasive, found everywhere on Earth, from the Sahara Desert to patches of Arctic sea ice. Yet despite these plastic particles' ubiquity, scientists have struggled to determine exactly how many of them are in our atmosphere.

Easily swept up by wind and carried long distances by water, these tiny motes are also exceedingly difficult to detect and almost impossible to remove from the environment. Past estimates have focused on accounting for microplastics generated by human activity or directly measuring their concentration in the air in any given area. But these measures are highly variable: along the southeastern coast of China, for example, atmospheric microplastic estimates have ranged from 0.004 to 190 particles per m3. The researchers hope the findings will act as a baseline for future studies of global microplastic levels, including new measures that will be able to account for even smaller particles than they did.
