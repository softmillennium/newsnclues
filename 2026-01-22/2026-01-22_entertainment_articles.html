But Elordi has started a new chapter in his young, auspicious career, as he prepares to topline a studio movie next month in Wuthering Heights opposite Margot Robbie and return for the much-hyped third season of Euphoria. 'Sinners' Star Wunmi Mosaku on Being a First-Time Oscar Nominee, Gratitude for Ryan Coogler: "He Hasn't Been Tainted by Capitalism" Rose Byrne Calls Her Oscar Nomination "Monumental" -- and Says New Pet Bearded Dragon Is "Doing Well" “I am beside myself,” Elordi tells The Hollywood Reporter. I'm not sure where you are in the world, but did you wake up for the nominations? My mother is with me right now, and I heard her phone ring and it woke me from my sleep, and then I heard her feet running up the stairs. She had my whole team on a group FaceTime call. This character for me and what is on screen is everything that I've wanted to say as an actor my whole life. It's everything that I could possibly express of myself in a part. So in a way, the creature is the personification of a dream I had when I was very small. A lot of your below-the-line colleagues were recognized for their contributions. It's incredibly confirming and it makes me super grateful to the Academy and to the movie industry because it tells me that we are looking at the right things. The same with films like Sinners that are also handmade, it's just incredible actors, incredible artisans being recognized for real handmade cinematic work. It's a good thing for the movies. What are some of the performances you are excited to be in the conversation with this year? Even down to the performances that I'm nominated with — every actor grew up on Sean Penn. I mean, that's the bar in terms of real performance. Then Stellan Skarsgard, Benicio del Toro — these are people that I've read the unofficial biographies of. Guillermo was not nominated for directing despite receiving a lot of recognition along the way. I see that our film has nine nominations, and for him particularly adapting the screenplay, something that's so dear and personal to him, I think that is just such an incredible achievement. None of us have these nominations without Guillermo del Toro. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Send us a tip using our anonymous form.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump raged at the latest New York Times/Siena Poll, which shows him with low approval after a year in office, and said that he'll add what he called the “fake results” to his defamation claim against the Gray Lady. Trump's Truth Social post on Thursday is only the latest threat to target pollsters with legal action. He sued pollster Ann Selzer and the Des Moines Register over a 2024 pre-election poll showing his behind in Iowa, yet he went on to win the state. Trump posted on Truth Social, “The Times Siena Poll, which is always tremendously negative to me, especially just before the Election of 2024, where I won in a Landslide, will be added to my lawsuit against The Failing New York Times. Our lawyers have demanded that they keep all Records, and how they “computed” these fake results — Not just the fact that it was heavily skewed toward Democrats. They will be held fully responsible for all of their Radical Left lies and wrongdoing!” Actors And Musicians Help Launch "Stealing Isn't Innovation" Campaign To Protest Big Tech's Use Of Copyrighted Works In AI Models Live Video Platform 2WAY Names Joe Ruffolo As New CEO The Times/Siena Poll, published on Thursday, showed that 49% of those surveyed said that the country was worse off under Trump, versus 32% who said better. Trump sued the Times last year, claiming, among other things, that Susanne Craig and Ross Buettner, and their book Lucky Loser, defamed him. Their article was headlined, “The Star-Making Machine That Created ‘Donald Trump. His lawsuit cited claims made in the book that Trump received “the equivalent of more than $400 million from his father, much of it through fraudulent tax evasion schemes.” It does not allege, as it must, how each statement in suit is false or what President Trump contends the truth to be, and it challenges statements that are not defamatory.” Trump's lawsuit against Selzer and the Register cited an Iowa consumer law. After dismissing the lawsuit in federal court, Trump filed it in state court, a day before a state anti-SLAPP statute took effect. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar nomination Thursday morning for One Battle After Another puts him in such rarefied air that before our eyes he's transforming from the actor of his generation to one of the most accomplished actors ever. It puts him in the company of eight other actors to be nominated for at least seven Oscars, a group that includes Ingrid Bergman, Jeff Bridges, Richard Burton, Robert Duvall, Jane Fonda, Greer Garson, Dustin Hoffman and DiCaprio's Titanic costar Kate Winslet. His six Best Actor nominations tie him with Burton and Daniel Day-Lewis for most all time. RELATED: Oscars: Every Best Actor Oscar Winner Back To 1927 As usual, his focus was not on himself but rather his Oscar-nominated castmates on One Battle After Another and writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson. It was also about the reminder that sometimes when you take risks and swing for the fences from your heels, you hit home runs. While Warner Bros leaders Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy were unfairly shackled with risks taken on One Battle After Another and Sinners, they are looking pretty smart today: those films got a total of 29 nominations at a time when specialty labels and not studios rule the awards circuit. One Battle After Another's release has been a momentum builder, transitioning from theaters to streaming at an optimal time. I tell DiCaprio this is a movie that lends itself better than many to repeat viewings, where you can focus on different performances, action, and great dialogue each time. “That is the ultimate compliment for this film,” DiCaprio told Deadline. “Having watched the film that way a multitude of times myself, I feel it's a testament to the incredible amount of thought that Paul put into this story. When films take on a different meaning or a different pathos, you feel you can take a side road into any of these small characters' lives because they are all so fully fulfilled and hashed out with real identities. I feel like he really put his thumb on the pulse of America right now. I hope it will be remembered that way, and lives on for years to come. And it's all a testament to Paul's writing and what he wanted to say about who we are right now.” There are only five nominations in each Oscar category except Best Picture, and somebody's going to be left out. DiCaprio, Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn and Teyana Taylor all got nods. Acting in her first major feature, Chase Infiniti did not. “Chase was the heart and soul of this movie,” DiCaprio said. “And she's going to have an incredible career ahead of her. I was incredibly fortunate to work with so many people that I've looked up to for years in this industry, and it was an incredible experience. “To work on this film with Paul and just to collaborate on a film that just feels so topical, man, it's unbelievable,” DiCaprio said. “It has been so cool to be a part of this band, when you go out in the world and are able to talk about a film that you're truly proud of. We've been doing it for the past year, and there's an ease to talking about something that you have such a genuine love and pride for. RELATED: Leonardo DiCaprio On ‘One Battle After Another', His “No Regrets” Career And The Fight To Save Cinema “When I make a movie, I always look at the props and wonder, what might be the memorable symbol of some of these films? So no, the bathrobe isn't hanging in his closet. “It's gotten harder to get those props out of the studios, man. DiCaprio will next star with Jennifer Lawrence in the Martin Scorsese-directed What Happens at Night, as Michael Mann continues work on Heat 2, the crime classic sequel. Last time Deadline spoke with DiCaprio, he was weighing whether to play Vincent Hanna (the role originated by Al Pacino) or Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) and their continuing adventures. I tried to pry out details on that and his Golden Globes viral moment, and he shut down like the door of a studio prop vault. “On Heat 2, we're keeping that one tight,” he said. As for his animated Golden Globes moment that went viral to the point lip readers were speculating on who he was speaking to, and whether the subject was KPop Demon Hunters?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dig out the feather boas and plan your sparkliest getup: Harry Styles is heading out on a global world tour in 2026. The newly announced run of 50 dates in seven cities — called Together, Together — will take Styles to Europe, North America, Latin America and Australia. The first show kicks off in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on May 16, and the trek is currently slated to conclude in Sydney, Australia, on Dec. 13. The album's lead track, “Aperture,” is set for release Thursday evening (Jan. 22) at 7 p.m ET; a number of in-person listening parties were held in cities across the world on Wednesday in anticipation of the track. Styles first began teasing his return to the stage in late 2025 by sharing a video from his most recent concert in Bologna, Italy. The tour will kick off with six nights at Amsterdam's Johann Cruijff Arena before heading to London's Wembley Stadium for a further six shows. In July, he hits São Paulo, Brazil then Mexico City, and the following month, he begins a 30-night residency at New York City's Madison Square Garden. A number of huge names will join him on tour at each stop with Robyn, Shania Twain, Fcukers, Jamie xx, Jorja Smith, Fousheé, Skye Newman and Baby J set to support. An artist presale will commence on Jan. 28 via AMEX with full details and times for each date available at Styles' site. To participate in the artist presale for New York, fans must sign up at Ticketmaster before Jan. 25 11:59 p.m. For dates in Europe and Australia, hopefuls must pre-order the new album from Styles' U.K., E.U. or AU stores before Saturday, Jan. 24, at 11:59 p.m. local time to access. Humanitarian charity Choose Love is partnered on all dates, with HeadCount also partnering with Styles at his New York shows.

Attendees were still sleepy as the ceremony began — on the dot, at 5:30 a.m. — but there was also a palpable excitement in the air for Phase Two of awards season to kick off, and to finally find out what films made the final cut in what has been a particularly competitive Oscar race. Related Stories The 2026 Oscar Craft Nominations Are Reflected in the Academy's New Casting Category ‘One Battle' Looks Unstoppable with a Commanding 13 Oscar Nominations, but It Was ‘Sinners' That Made Oscar History — Analysis “This year, the Oscars celebrate our humanity, our connection with each other, and remind us once again that the world is made up of individual stories that have the power to unite us through narratives that speak to the emotions we all share,” she said. “We live in a time of limitless technology that enables us to push the boundaries of our cinematic experience, and our profound belief is that the heartbeat of film is, and will always remain, unmistakably human.” That last line earned applause from the in-person audience, keying up the main event perfectly: Former Best Supporting Actress nominee Danielle Brooks and “The Testament of Ann Lee” star Lewis Pullman started reading the esteemed names and titles, and a clear crowd favorite soon emerged: “Sinners,” Ryan Coogler's Southern horror blockbuster about a Black community in a small town haunted by vampires, cleaned up, breaking the record with 16 total nominations. “Sinners” also gave nomination morning one of the most delightful surprises, when on-the-bubble contender Delroy Lindo, who plays pianist Delta Slim, made his way into the Best Supporting Actor lineup. Beating out the presumptive fifth-man, Paul Mescal for “Hamnet,” Lindo's long-awaited first Oscar nom sparked massive applause. On the opposite end of the surprise scale, but clearly a film that had its fans present, was “KPop Demon Hunters,” which received a huge reaction for its very expected Best Animated Feature and Best Song (for “Golden”) nods. Other unexpected nominations elicited more shock mixed with excitement. Kate Hudson's surprise entry in the Best Actress field, for the Neil Diamond jukebox musical “Song Sung Blue,” was met with cheers but also some evident astonishment, as did Elle Fanning's inclusion in Best Supporting Actress for “Sentimental Value,” the very first nomination announced. And Oliver Laxe's rave drama “Sirāt,” which over-performed in the shortlists, was greeted with delight when it made the Best International Feature and Best Sound categories.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blake Lively's longtime fitness trainer recalled feeling “uncomfortable” during an interaction with Justin Baldoni. Don Saladino recalled communicating with the “It Ends With Us” director “a handful of times” in February 2023, according to a court declaration obtained by Us Weekly Wednesday. “He provided information on his nutrition and workout regimen. His existing workout program included regular back extensions,” Saladino said of Baldoni. “I recommended Mr. Baldoni a workout program and provided information to him about my standard nutrition plan,” Saladino continued. “I recall that Mr. Baldoni asked me how much Ms. Lively would weigh by the start of filming,” Saladino claimed in the filing. “I have never experienced someone reaching out to me about a client's weight,” Saladino claimed. “I felt that Mr. Baldoni's explanation for his question was dishonest, given that, based on my understanding of Mr. Baldoni's workout regimen, he would easily be able to perform a lift in a range that would include Ms. Lively.” Page Six has reached out to Baldoni's rep for comment. Saladino's statement confirmed reports in 2024 that Lively allegedly felt “fat-shamed” by Baldoni's inquiry into her weight. At the time, sources claimed Baldoni asked a trainer about Lively's weight before shooting a scene where he had to lift her up. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. The “Jane the Virgin” star, who reportedly has a history of back pain, wanted to make sure that he could lift her without injury. Lively felt “bothered” by his question about her weight — especially considering she gave birth to her fourth child just months before production for their movie began. Baldoni denied the accusations and hit back with a $400 million countersuit accusing Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, of defamation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With filming underway in Asheville, North Carolina, for Hallmark Channel's second “A Biltmore Christmas” movie, local media members were invited to the Biltmore Estate on January 20, 2026, for a peek behind the scenes. Not only were previously announced stars Niall Matter and Holland Roden on hand for interviews, but so was another Hallmark fan favorite, Rachel Boston, who made a cameo in the first movie and confirmed she's now part of the second installment, too! And she's not the only star fans are buzzing about being part of the movie, which also has an official title: “A Grand Biltmore Christmas.” “A Grand Biltmore Christmas” is also a time travel tale, but because Hallmark has said it's not a true sequel, it's not clear whether Boston will return as the same modern-day actress or play an entirely different role. During press interviews, she told local ABC affiliate WLOS that she loved “having these memories and being back with this fabulous cast for ‘A Grand Biltmore Christmas. '” She also called Asheville “such a great town” and said that in their downtime, the cast “really enjoyed exploring.” Meanwhile, Brown teased his own return by posting a photo in his Instagram Stories on January 19 of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which the Biltmore House overlooks, and writing, “Hello, North Carolina.” Although he wasn't part of the press interviews the following day, Hallmark's PR team confirmed January 21 that he, too, is returning for “A Grand Biltmore Christmas.” Finally, there's also been buzz that “The Way Home” star and former Asheville resident Andie MacDowell may be a surprise addition to the cast. “I'm coming from the modern era in this movie,” Matter told WLOS. “Our characters are acquaintances in the past,” he continued, looking at Roden. Boston, who also starred in Hallmark's top Christmas movie of 2025 — “The More the Merrier,” told local CBS affiliate WSPA of the new Biltmore movie script, “Having read it, I will say, it is absolutely adorable and very, very, very sweet.” The new movie, produced by Synthetic Cinema, which also was behind the first Biltmore movie, will premiere as part of Hallmark's 2026 slate of original Christmas movies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But rather than respect and protect this valuable asset, some of the biggest tech companies, many backed by private equity and other funders, are using American creators' work to build AI platforms without authorization or regard for copyright law,” reads the statement. “Artists, writers, and creators of all kinds are banding together with a simple message: Stealing our work is not innovation. A better way exists – through licensing deals and partnerships, some AI companies have taken the responsible, ethical route to obtaining the content and materials they wish to use. We can have advanced, rapidly developing AI and ensure creators' rights are respected.” The letter has already received about 700 signatures, according to Deadline. Some of the names we recognized, in no particular order, include Vince Gilligan, Winnie Holzman, OK Go, Olivia Munn, Cyndi Lauper, Jennifer Hudson, They Might Be Giants, Sean Astin, George Saunders, Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Bell, R.E.M., Alex Winter, Cate Blanchett, Chaka Khan, Bonnie Raitt, Aimee Mann, and Fran Drescher. The question of AI theft has been circulating for years now and likely isn't going away any time soon. While massive companies like Disney have the option to enter into lucrative deals with OpenAI (after dubbing a rival AI company a “bottomless pit of plagiarism”) the majority of actors, novelists, and whoever else does not have this option. Last year, a group of writers brought a lawsuit against Anthropic AI, alleging that the tech used their copyrighted writing without permission or payment to train its Claude model.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States may feel like it's on the brink of a civil war led by its own government, but one thing Americans seem to agree on in our nation's bisesquicentennial year is the peaceful, easy feeling we all get from the Eagles‘ early years. Runner-up to the Eagles, of course, remains Michael Jackson‘s Thriller (1982), which retains its 34x platinum status, certified in 2021. Well, gee … (blushes, adjusts tie), it's the Eagles again, this time with Hotel California, which, as of Thursday, is now freshly certified 28x platinum. That achievement, of course, is due to the Eagles' greatest hits capping things off in 1975, a year before Hotel California came out, making it so you need both if you're a real Eagles fan. For Eagles singer-songwriter Don Henley, who recognized another milestone (Greatest Hits came out nearly half a century ago on Feb. 17, 1976), quadruple diamond status is a cultural victory. “In an age, in a culture, where everything seems to become more ephemeral, by the day, it is gratifying to have been part of something that endures, even for 50 years,” he said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Alana then took aim at Brooklyn's lengthy statement, in which he blasted his parents, David and Victoria Beckham, for trying to “ruin” his marriage to Peltz. “Ending an eight paragraph rant about his family's dirty laundry with ‘all we want is privacy' is all I need to know,” Alana wrote. Page Six has reached out to reps for Alana, Peltz and Brooklyn for comment but did not immediately hear back. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Their romance reportedly ended due to strained family relations with Anwar and his mother, Yolanda Hadid. Peltz is now involved in more family drama with her husband Brooklyn's estranged relatives. On Monday, the aspiring chef, also 26, released a scathing statement against his parents, stating that he does not “want to reconcile” with them. Brooklyn also claimed the Spice Girls singer, 51, and David, 50, push certain stories to the press about their eldest son and his wife. The nepo baby also denied claims that the “Transformers: Age of Extinction” star “controls” him, calling this notion “completely backward.” The Beckhams have not directly addressed Brooklyn's claims; however, David made a cryptic comment about his children's “mistakes.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's for pluralism and inclusion; unity, not division. Go write your own song, leave mine alone," he writes. Men at Work's “Down Under” is Australia's unofficial anthem, a classic tune played at sporting events, pubs, and celebrations around the world whenever Aussies gather. It's not, however, a siren's call for the far right. The Temper Trap Let it All Out With Late-Night Performance of 'Giving Up Air': Watch 1 as Bruno Mars' 'I Just Might' Makes Chart Debut on Japan Hot 100 Hay has drawn a virtual line in the sand, telling “March For Australia” organizers to find another song to play at their rallies. “Let me say that I most strenuously disapprove of any unauthorized, unlicensed use of Down Under, for any ‘March For Australia' events,” he writes. “'Down Under,' a song I co-wrote, does not belong to those who attempt to sow xenophobia within the fabric of our great land, our great people,” he continues. Men at Work enjoyed a dream breakthrough with their debut album Business As Usual, and its standout single “Down Under,” which reigned for four weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, and has sold more than two million copies in the United States. It's not the first time Hay has had to fight for his signature song. Hay and his Men at Work co-songwriter Ron Strykert were involved in a bruising court battle, which began in 2009 and centered on the flute riff and whether it was lifted from the children's campfire song “Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree.” To settle the case, a court ordered Men at Work to pay just 5% of royalties in the song. Hay told Billboard in 2023 that “Down Under” is “very dear to me. When I wrote the song, I had a lot of fear and trepidation about Australia becoming overdeveloped, like you know, Florida or something, and on the other side of the coin, there was this beautiful uniqueness and incredible — a kind of awesomeness — of the country which I thought, ‘we don't want to lose that'. “Down Under” has passed more than one billion streams across all platforms, and enjoyed a second life when it was reworked as a drum ‘n' bass cut by Australian producer Luude, over Hay's vocals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We've said it before, and we'll say it again: Naming your TV show anything that will make for a punny headline when it nigh-inevitably gets canceled is just asking for trouble. Something Netflix and Kurt Sutter just got done proving all over again, as Variety reports that the former has just rendered the latter's historical Western series The Abandons, well… You know. The news was one of two cancellations the streamer handed down today, having also placed up on the chopping block two-season comedy series The Vince Staples Show. That one's both a bummer, and a bit of a surprise, in so far as the show—originally created by the Summertime '06 rapper with Ian Edelman and Maurice Williams, and centered on a surreal version of Staples' life as an easily recognized celebrity—was both a critical hit and a genuinely funny, interesting slice of comedy TV. Club‘s review of the show's second season, Leila Latif wrote that, “In a landscape crowded with self-referential comedies, this one still feels singular, less a parody of Black excellence than a meditation on what it costs to live inside your own image,” praising Staples' chops as a comic actor, and ultimately calling the series “one of Netflix's brightest comedies.” The Abandons, not so much. Even if you ignore the show's dismal critical reaction—our own D+ was par for the course, noting that not even TV stalwarts like Lena Headey and Gillian Anderson could find much to do with the series' stale take on 1850s frontier living—the show's incredibly troubled production probably had it doomed anyway. In what could be taken as a preemptive bout of title pun synergy, Sutter reportedly walked away from the series with an episode left to film after getting into arguments with the streamer, leaving the show's other producers to scramble to get something workable on the screen. That wouldn't have boded well even if the resulting series turned out to be a masterpiece; as is, it's one of the less surprising cancellations we've seen in a minute.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>David Siegel, a longtime producer who worked on iconic films such as “The Hangover” trilogy and “Crazy, Stupid, Love,” has passed away at the age of 70 years old. He died on Jan. 8 in Los Angeles, a representative for New Line told Deadline. The representative went on to describe Siegel as “the person you wanted at your side when a production developed complications.” “Colleagues were said to have remarked on his uncanny ability to connect with crew — a respect earned through the way his career evolved in the industry. He also mentored countless individuals across production, giving opportunities to those who demonstrated hard work and curiosity and advocating for them quietly,” Deadline wrote. Throughout his career that spanned four decades, Siegel worked on numerous projects with incredible filmmakers such as Kevin Costner, Todd Phillips, Rob Reiner, Penny Marshall, and David Lester. Along with that, his resume includes working on films such as “Dances with Wolves,” “Gravity,” “The Pursuit of Happyness,” “The LEGO Movie,” “War Dogs,” “Serenity,” “Holes,” “Air Force One,” “Bull Durham,” and many others. Some comments were left on social media, paying tribute to the producer. Thank you for all the films and memories — your impact on Hollywood will be remembered,” one fan wrote. Your work on The Hangover trilogy and Crazy, Stupid, Love brought so much laughter to the world,” another fan posted. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>
