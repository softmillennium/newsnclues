An internal memo from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) suggests that agents are authorized to enter the homes of immigrants and citizens alike without a judicial warrant — an assertion that violates the Fourth Amendment and several years of caselaw stating otherwise. According to that organization, the ICE memo, issued in May 2025, authorizes agents “to enter the residence of an alien subject to a final order of deportation, without consent, including by ‘a necessary and reasonable amount of force'” using Form I-205, which is an administrative warrant, not a judicial one. Administrative warrants, which are issued by ICE or the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), allow seizures or arrests of individuals under certain circumstances, but do not allow for search or entry of a person's property without their consent. ICE secretly told its officers that any time someone has been ordered removed, ICE can break down their door.It has been accepted for generations that the only thing which can authorize agents to break into your home is a warrant signed by a judge. The extent to which the memo has been shared throughout the agency is unclear, though there are several examples of ICE or other federal immigration officials entering people's homes without valid judicial warrants, including homes of U.S. citizens. At least one instructor has resigned from their position rather than teach the new directive. Importantly, the amendment does not differentiate between rights of citizens and immigrants. David Kligerman, senior vice president and special counsel at Whistleblower Aid, derided the Trump administration for issuing a directive so flagrantly unconstitutional. In a statement accompanying an explanation of ICE's memo, Kligerman also noted: “No court has ever found that ICE agents have such legal authority to enter homes without a judicial warrant.” The ICE directive was widely condemned as illegal, with critics ranging from lawmakers in Congress to legal experts. “Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) said in a statement. “It is a legally and morally abhorrent policy that exemplifies the kinds of dangerous, disgraceful abuses America is seeing in real time.” (Notably, Blumenthal has not voiced support for abolishing the agency, despite strong support from the American public for doing so.) “I try to avoid hyperbole when it comes to Trump policies, but this is absolutely frickin' insane,” said Georgetown Law professor Steve Vladeck, adding that the memo represents “massive, systemic Fourth Amendment violations.” Responding to Vladeck's post on Bluesky, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, explained just how worrisome the memo is to legal experts, saying it is “one of my top 5 scandals for this admin so far,” perhaps even within his “top 3.” “This is a massive overreach of power by the Trump administration. It's a fundamental right,” the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has been on the ground in Minnesota for two days meeting with federal prosecutors from the state. Lemon, who is a former CNN host who now makes content independently, was with dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters as they rushed into Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota on Sunday morning, interrupting a church service and leading to tense confrontations, CNN has reported. Lemon has said that he was present at the demonstration as a journalist and not as a protester. In a video of the episode that he posted on YouTube, Lemon says “I'm just here photographing, I'm not part of the group… I'm a journalist.” The Justice Department has arrested two people involved in the protests, CNN has reported. CNN has reached out to representatives for Lemon. The Department of Justice could always try again to bring charges against him. This story was updated with additional information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal magistrate judge rejected the Justice Department's initial attempt to bring charges against journalist Don Lemon for appearing alongside protesters who breached a Minnesota church over the weekend, a source told CNN. Attorney General Pam Bondi has been on the ground in Minnesota for two days meeting with federal prosecutors from the state. Lemon, who is a former CNN host who now makes content independently, was with dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters as they rushed into Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Sunday morning, interrupting a church service and leading to tense confrontations, CNN has reported. Lemon has said that he was present at the demonstration as a journalist and not as a protester. In a video of the episode that he posted on YouTube, Lemon says “I'm just here photographing, I'm not part of the group… I'm a journalist.” It is highly unusual for the Justice Department to attempt to criminally charge a journalist who is actively working – though it is not without precedent. Such charges are heavily scrutinized, and, if approved by a judge, often face extended legal battles over whether the journalist is protected by the First Amendment before the case makes it to trial. In Lemon's case, Justice Department officials immediately, and publicly, asserted that he would face charges. They said Lemon did not have a right to be on the church's private property, adding that interrupting the service may have impeded in the churchgoers' constitutional rights to express their religion. “The magistrate's reported actions confirm the nature of Don's First Amendment protected work this weekend in Minnesota as a reporter. It was no different than what he has done for more than 30 years, reporting and covering newsworthy events on the ground and engaging in constitutionally protected activity as a journalist,” Lemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement Thursday. Lowell added that Lemon would “fight any charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,” should the DOJ continue to pursue them. The Department of Justice could always try again to bring charges against Lemon. Tensions between protesters and federal authorities have continued to escalate, with the administration planning to surge federal agents in the city. The church protesters claimed in Lemon's video that a pastor at Cities Church in St. Paul, David Easterwood, appeared to be a top ICE official in the Twin Cities. Dozens of protesters can also been seen on video chanting “Justice for Renee Good” and engaging in angry exchanges with members of the congregation.

Under Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has gone on an explicitly fascist zag as it seeks to recruit 10,000 additional U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Robert Reich and others have detailed in recent weeks how ICE is now actively seeking to recruit extremist young men from gun shows, Ultimate Fight Club venues, rodeos, martial arts centers, and other haunts for men who tend to have a far right political vision. ICE is actively employing recruiters who use right-wing social media and influencer operations to get at potential recruits. And it is explicitly targeting young men who listen to “patriotic” (in other words, hard-right) podcasts. Part of ICE's “wartime recruitment” schtick now involves asking potential applicants if they want to repel “foreign invaders” — and then offering them $50,000 sign-up bonuses if they decide to join. They include a “Your Country Needs You” poster of Uncle Sam, from August of last year, in which Uncle Sam asks “Which way, American Man?” One arrow points to “Invasion,” another to “Cultural Decline,” while a third points toward Uncle Sam and reads “Homeland.” ICE is now actively seeking to recruit extremist young men from gun shows. Another shows a father-son combo, both with features that the Nazis would have deemed acceptably “Aryan,” clad in body armor and holding assault rifles, with the caption “No Age Cap. Still another Uncle Sam recruitment poster from the summer reads, “America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.” Other recruitment posters include a photo of a spacious family van, alongside the words “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys? Think about how many criminal illegal aliens you could fit in this bad boy!” JOIN.ICE.GOV.” The agency is also using memes from popular video games to further their recruitment efforts. Meanwhile, on January 9, DHS and the White House posted a recruitment video on Instagram titled “We'll have our home again,” accompanied by a visual image of a heroic-looking cowboy riding along the base of snow-covered mountains, and the Pine Tree Riots song “We'll have our home again,” which has, according to The Intercept, become increasingly popular within neo-Nazi subcultures. ICE's “wartime recruitment” schtick now involves asking potential applicants if they want to repel “foreign invaders” — and then offering them $50,000 sign-up bonuses. The chorus to this truly appalling song is “Oh by God we'll have our home again/ By God we'll have our home/ By blood or sweat, we'll get there yet/ By God we'll have our home.” The verses lament that “in our own towns, we're foreigners now/ Our names are spat and cursed.” And they decry the fate of “noble sons driven down beneath a coward's heel.” Not surprisingly, these lyrics are beloved by Proud Boys and other extremists — and now, apparently, by recruitment officers and propagandists at ICE. In many of these instances, the visual and audio similarities to Nazi wartime messaging is stark. The circumstances of Good's killing were particularly egregious: she was shot at least four times by agent Jonathan Ross, who shouted “fucking bitch” as he fired at her while she was clearly trying to drive away from the protest; and her reputation was subsequently slimed by Noem, Donald Trump, JD Vance, and other high-level administration officials who all accused her, without evidence, of being a paid agitator and a domestic terrorist. Those officials then doubled down and, even before any investigation had been carried out, claimed, as Vance put it, that Ross had “absolute immunity” for his actions on the streets of Minneapolis. None of this has been conducive to assuaging growing national anger about ICE's tactics — tactics that even MAGA luminary Joe Rogan opposes: Rogan recently described Trump's ICE as behaving like “the Gestapo.” The visual and audio similarities to Nazi wartime messaging is stark. Each day since Good's killing, the protests have grown, only to be met with the deployment of masked, armed federal agents in military uniforms who have turned parts of Minneapolis into what looks like a war zone; and last week, on the same day that ICE agents shot another Minneapolis resident, this time non-fatally, Trump declared that he was leaning toward invoking the Insurrection Act so as to bring in active-duty military personnel to target the protesters. DHS's explicit use of neo-Nazi references and imagery to recruit new agents for its rapidly expanding ICE force is a grim warning of where we are headed. The scramble to pack ICE with far right recruits and instill in them a sense of total impunity risks pushing ICE toward becoming an organization similar to the Black and Tans in Ireland a little over a century ago — a group of British ex-soldiers who were hired by the British administration in Ireland to dole out death and torture against Irish civilians, raining down terror on public events and private homes alike in their effort to keep Ireland under the British imperial thumb. As ICE deploys its forces to occupy immigrant neighborhoods of big, Democratic-run cities, its tactics resemble the way Israel polices Palestinians — ruthlessly and violently, with a nod-and-a-wink to civilian and military officers who know they will be exonerated if they shoot civilians. If there is an afterlife, I'm sure Joseph Goebbels, master propagandist of the Third Reich, is looking down and smiling, thin-lipped and cold-eyed, with approval. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes. We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks. We can only resist Trump's attacks by cultivating a strong base of support.

He added: “Europe remains in Greenland mode: maybe someone somewhere will do something.” And perhaps, most importantly, what message does it send to Denmark?” During the speech, Zelenskyy also suggested that Ukraine could help defend Europe in the event of a Russian invasion of Greenland, saying: “We know what to do if Russian warships go near Greenland, Ukraine can help with that. He also suggested that Europe should play a more muscular role in targeting Russia's “shadow fleet” of oil tankers that help bankroll its war machine, and said it remained too easy for Russia to bypass sanctions that allow it to continue mass-producing missiles and other ordinance. The threats to Europe were existential for Nato, he said, and Europe needed a “united armed forces” that could defend the continent. “Today, Europe relies only on the belief that if danger comes, then Nato will react. But no one has really seen the alliance in action. If Putin decides to take Lithuania or strike Poland, who will respond? His envoy Steve Witkoff is to meet Vladimir Putin later on Thursday. “I think we've got it down to one issue and we have discussed iterations of that issue, and that means it's solvable,” Witkoff said before flying to Moscow. Asked at Davos whether he had a message for Putin, Trump said: “The war has to end.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Geopolitical developments add to a sense of political anxiety that started building early last year.Olezzo/iStockPhoto / Getty Images Every day it feels like the Trump administration does something new to disrupt the global world order, as we used to know it. Carney stands with Greenland, criticizes Trump without naming him in blunt Davos speech When U.S. President Donald Trump first made annexation threats against Canada, along with promises of a trade war, The Globe asked readers how they were feeling and received nearly 100 responses from people expressing angst about the future. A survey released in late March, 2025, by Mental Health Research Canada found 42 per cent of Canadians reported increased anxiety levels over the prior month, with many citing tensions with the U.S. as a factor. Stefanie Peachey, a registered social worker based in Burlington, Ont., says more clients are asking for help to deal with fears over the upheaval south of the border and how it could affect them. “Now they see images on social media of armed ICE agents roaming the streets of American cities, throwing people to the ground and even shooting them. In light of mounting tensions, we asked mental health experts for suggestions on how to cope. “The fundamental truth is that we cannot control external factors such as other people's actions, or government decisions.” The best way to move past despair caused by geopolitical events is to do something, says Amanda Friesen, associate professor and Canada research chair in political psychology at Western University. Get involved in your local community through organizations aimed at helping people or working on problems you care about, she says, adding that collective action is more effective than one person complaining. Concentrate on the issue really tearing you up and ask yourself, ‘Is there some organization locally that I could get involved with, donate money to or learn more about?' And rather than going down rabbit holes or watching endless videos, focus only on key developments. “There is no such thing as full information on current events and reading hourly updates will do little for your personal knowledge or ability to act,” says Friesen. “Our cognitive and emotional systems are not prepared for the constant inflow of information. '” Peachey says this simple question can help people make more conscious choices about what they consume. Peachey says self-care and doing things you enjoy isn't selfish. “There is good evidence that people who are lifelong learners, feel better and are more productive, too,” says Dr. David Gratzer, attending psychiatrist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Gratzer says it's also vital to maintain healthy habits that support your overall well-being during stressful times. Peachey says even short and simple activities such as taking five- to 10-minute stretch breaks can have a profound impact. “These breaks boost creativity, productivity and mood, breaking the cycle of anxious rumination,” she says. “A 15-minute daily walk may seem modest, but it can enhance blood circulation, elevate energy levels and provide a mental reset, offering clarity and respite from anxious thoughts.” When anxiety takes over, it's easy to put familiar routines on hold. However, Peachey says maintaining structure in your day “is one of the best ways to create stability amid uncertainty. Continue with the things that regularly fill your time – going to work, exercising, seeing friends and engaging in hobbies. “The self-accountability of keeping up with your daily activities and responsibilities will help you stay more present and reinforce the reality that life goes on, even in difficult times,” she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian drone strikes inflicted damage on Russian oil and weapons facilities in widespread attacks carried out overnight on Jan. 22, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces confirmed. Targets included Russia's Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, several radar stations in Russian-occupied Crimea, a drone storage facility in the occupied part of Kherson Oblast, command and observation post of Russian military personnel in Donetsk Oblast. Tamanneftegaz, located in the village of Volna, Krasnodar Krai, operates the Taman transshipment complex, handling crude oil, petroleum products, and liquefied hydrocarbon gases. According to Ukraine's General Staff, there was a direct hit on the terminal, resulting in explosions and a fire. Damage to shutoff valves caused petroleum products to leak and then ignite, the source said, adding that the fire covered about 7,000 square meters. The source estimated preliminary losses at about $50 million and said the terminal's tank farm for storing petroleum products and liquefied gas exceeds 1 million cubic meters. Krasnodar Krai Governor Veniamin Kondratiev wrote on Telegram on the evening of Jan. 21 that as a result of the attack, four tanks containing petroleum products caught fire. He claimed that two enterprise employees died, and several others were injured in the attack. Previously the terminal was attacked on Dec. 22, 2025, Ukraine's General Staff said. Ukraine reported additional strikes on military targets in Russian-occupied regions, including Crimea, Kherson and Donetsk oblasts. In the occupied part of Kherson Oblast, a drone storage facility in Novohryhorivka was also hit, the General Staff said. Yuliia Taradiuk is a Ukrainian reporter at the Kyiv Independent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of defrauding Theranos' investors and is not eligible for release until December, 2031.Jeff Chiu/The Associated Press Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of now-defunct blood testing startup Theranos, has asked U.S. President Donald Trump to release her from prison with nearly six years left before she is eligible for release. Holmes sought to commute her 11-1/4-year sentence last year and her request remains pending, according to the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney. Now 41, Holmes was convicted in 2022 on four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy for cheating investors, and ordered to pay US$452-million in restitution. A federal appeals court upheld her conviction and sentence last February. Prosecutors said Holmes lied to investors from 2010 to 2015 by promising Theranos' technology could run many medical tests on one blood drop from a finger prick. Holmes would still owe restitution if Trump released her from prison, but would not owe it if he pardoned her. The White House declined to comment on Holmes' request.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A private autopsy has determined that Renee Good, the unarmed US citizen and mother killed by a federal immigration officer in Minneapolis earlier this month, was shot three times, in her forearm, breast and head. The independent postmortem was commissioned by lawyers in Chicago representing Good's family, and its findings were released late on Wednesday, ABC7 News reported. The autopsy, described as preliminary, found three clear gunshot wounds on the 37-year-old's body, two of which were not immediately life-threatening. The Good family's attorneys, Romanucci and Blandin, declined to release the full report, but said it would continue “to gather evidence” in connection with her death as it pursued what it said was a civil investigation, the Times said. The death of Good, who relatives said was acting as a legal observer of a surge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Minneapolis, has raised tensions in the Minnesota city and sparked a fight between the Trump administration and local officials. The officer was forced to fire in self-defense, they claimed. State officials are angry that they have been cut out of an FBI inquiry, and that federal authorities are looking into Good's widow and Democratic leaders in Minnesota, including the governor, Tim Walz, and the Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, and not the officer who killed Good, Jonathan Ross. Separately, the justice department has said available video evidence “cleared” Ross, and that no criminal investigation was taking place. “The Department of Justice doesn't just stand up and investigate because some congressman thinks we should, because some governor thinks that we should,” Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, told Fox News on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has amplified its blaming of the victim, and support for an escalation of immigration enforcement activities, which have led to sometimes violent skirmishes with protesters and the arrests of US citizens and children. On Thursday, the vice-president, JD Vance, is expected in Minneapolis and will speak in defense of Donald Trump's decision to send 3,000 federal law enforcement officers to the area.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He also mentioned significant progress being made in the settlement of the Ukraine issue. Additionally, Trump noted that the US has "great relationships" with the new leadership of Venezuela. TASS has gathered key statements made by the US leader. The Board of Peace will operate in cooperation with the UN and many countries: "We'll work with many others including the United Nations." The board has every chance "to be one of the most consequential bodies ever created." Iran is willing to negotiate with the US: "Iran does want to talk, and we will talk." The US military budget will grow by 50% to $1.5 trillion in 2027. The conflict in Gaza is coming to an end: "They have to give up their weapons, and if they don't do that, it's going to be the end of them." The United States has "great relationships" with Venezuela's new leadership. The US is opening Venezuela to their "giant oil companies."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: The story was updated with additional details. U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled his new Board of Peace during a signing ceremony in Davos on Jan. 22, in an event attended by leaders and officials from 19 signatory states. The new body is launched primarily to oversee the ceasefire in Gaza, but U.S. officials said it would be expanded to other conflict regions. "It is going to be a successful effort, and you see it reflected here today among countries of different backgrounds from different parts of the world." Countries represented at the opening ceremony included Turkey, Hungary, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Argentina, Pakistan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. Others, including Belarus, Israel, and Vietnam, have also said they would join the Board, while France, Norway, and Sweden have rejected. Russia has been invited and said it was considering the option, while Trump claimed that Moscow had already accepted. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine had also received an invitation, but stressed that any such effort could only take place after the war ends. Belarus — (they are) allies of the Russians. I think so it will work with a monitor mission only after the war ends for us," he said. Addressing an audience during the ceremony in Switzerland, Trump hailed the coming "peace in the Middle East" and repeated his claim that he had settled eight conflicts, promising that "another one's coming pretty soon" in reference to Ukraine. The ceremony took place the same day as Trump's envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are scheduled to travel to Moscow to present Russian President Vladimir Putin with a 20-point peace framework for Ukraine. Witkoff has been optimistic about the progress in negotiations, noting that the talks are "down to one issue." "Just last year, here in Davos, I ended my speech by saying Europe needs to know how to defend itself. A White House official told the Kyiv Independent that the Board could play a role in different situations, without ruling out engagement on Russia's war in Ukraine. "We will not tolerate any violation," Emmanuel Macron said. The cities of Dnipro and Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast came under attack in the afternoon on Jan. 22, according to Ukraine's Air Force. Ukraine reported additional strikes on military targets in Russian-occupied regions, including Crimea, Kherson and Donetsk oblasts. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told Reuters that the deal would hinge on NATO allies doing more to strengthen Arctic security. The Kyiv Independent is launching a new "Through darkness, I stand with Ukraine" collection to help those suffering as a result of the escalating crisis caused by Russia's relentless attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, January 22. Officers of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) have detained an agent of Moldovan intelligence services in Moscow who came to carry out an assignment detrimental to Russia's security, the FSB's press service reported. "It has been established that in December 2025, a Russian citizen entered Moscow with the purpose of carrying out a task for the Information and Security Service of the Republic of Moldova, directed against Russia's security, during the preparation of which he was detained by officers of the Federal Security Service," the press service stated. Correspondence with an employee of the Moldovan intelligence service was found on his seized communication devices, confirming these circumstances. The FSB's Investigative Directorate has initiated a criminal case based on signs of a crime under article 275.1 of Russia's criminal code (confidential cooperation with a foreign state, international or foreign organization), and a preventive measure in the form of detention has been imposed. The article provides for up to 8 years of imprisonment. "The detainee is confessing. An investigation is underway," the FSB noted. "This is not the first instance where the intelligence services of the Republic of Moldova, despite receiving financial and advisory support from Western patrons and despite the high probability of exposure, have infiltrated their agents into Russia," the Federal Security Service noted. For example, in May 2025, two agents of Moldovan intelligence were detained in Moscow, having entered Russia on forged documents to carry out unlawful activities detrimental to the security of our country.</p>
