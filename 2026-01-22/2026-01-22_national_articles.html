The Buffalo Bills lost 33-30 in OT to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional round, and have fired their head coach Sean McDermott. Buffalo Bills wide Brandin Cooks said that he caught what ultimately turned into a controversial interception in the Denver Broncos' overtime victory on Saturday night. Cooks, 32, had the ball taken away from him by Broncos defensive back Ja'Quan McMillan after he seemingly completed the catch. Not just what it looked like, like you said, but what it felt like," Cooks said during a recent appearance on NFL Network's "Good Morning Football." Ja'Quan McMillian of the Denver Broncos intercepts a pass intended for Brandin Cooks of the Buffalo Bills during overtime in the AFC divisional playoff game at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, Colorado, on Jan. 17, 2026. "You see examples throughout the league all year, in previous years, and you like, wait a minute, if that was the catch, then there's a no-brainer that this was the catch. If it was ruled a catch, it would have moved the Bills into field goal range with a chance to win the game on a kick. "The first thing you think about, well, it's overtime, so we can't challenge it. And so, when the timeout happens, I'm like, okay, there's hope here," Cooks said. Denver Broncos cornerback Ja'Quan McMillian intercepts a pass intended for Buffalo Bills wide receiver Brandin Cooks during overtime of an AFC divisional round playoff game at Empower Field at Mile High. "Like, OK, they're about to take a look at this thing, and get it right. And that's what's going through my mind, right? The offense is marching out there for Denver. Clearly, they didn't look it through enough and, you know, here we are." What frustrated Cooks further, is that he was certain that he held onto the ball and made what could have been the game-winning catch. The other thing is the tie goes to offense, but I really feel in my heart of hearts that I caught that ball and ,you know, it doesn't matter now what I think or what I know," Cooks said. Denver Broncos cornerback Ja'Quan McMillian (29) reacts after intercepting a pass intended for Buffalo Bills wide receiver Brandin Cooks (18) during overtime of an NFL divisional round playoff football game in Denver, Colorado, on Jan. 17, 2026. Bills owner Terry Pegula told reporters on Wednesday that his decision to fire McDermott was based on the results of the team's 33-30 overtime loss to the Broncos on Sunday. Cooks signed with the Bills in late November to help bolster their wide receiving corps. In two playoff games, Cooks caught five passes for 78 yards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican authorities said Thursday that they arrested an alleged organized crime figure in the western state of Michoacan in connection with last October's killing of an outspoken leader of the state's lime growers. Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch said that authorities arrested the man known as “El Botox,” allegedly responsible for extorting lime growers and for various homicides, including the killing of agricultural leader Bernardo Bravo. A Michoacan state official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed the suspect's full name was César Alejandro Sepúlveda Arellano, leader of a group known as the White Trojans, or Blancos de Troya. The group is known to work with Los Viagras, a criminal organization allied with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. He has also been accused of attacking authorities with explosives. Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla said in a statement that his arrest Thursday represented “an overwhelming blow against extortion” in the state, which is Mexico's largest producer of limes and avocados. In October, the body of Bravo, president of the Apatzingan Valley Citrus Producers Association, was found in his vehicle on a road in the area. Two weeks after his killing, a gunman killed popular Uruapan Mayor Carlos Alberto Manzo, another outspoken critic of the cartels' control of Michoacan. The two homicides and the popular outcry that followed spurred the administration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to send more troops to Michoacan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many Greenlanders think Trump is dismissing them as a people. President Donald Trump talks to media after a meeting about Greenland during the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026. Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen speaks to journalists during press conference in Nuuk, Greenland, on Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026. An Aurora Borealis is seen in the sky above Nuuk, Greenland, on Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026. COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Denmark's prime minister insisted that her country can't negotiate on its sovereignty and Greenland's leader said Thursday it's a “red line” after U.S. President Donald Trump said he agreed on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security with the head of NATO. Much about the potential deal remained unclear, though Trump said in a Fox Business interview that “we're going to have total access to Greenland.” He added that “we're going to have all the military access we want.” Trump on Wednesday abruptly scrapped the tariffs he had threatened to impose on eight European nations to press for U.S. control over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. Trump said the deal, if completed, will also allow the United States to install an element of his “Golden Dome,” part of a multibillion dollar missile defense system, in Greenland. She said in a statement that she had spoken with Rutte “on an ongoing basis,” including before and after he met Trump in Davos. She wrote that “we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty” and added: “I have been informed that this has not been the case.” Frederiksen said that Denmark wants to continue engaging in constructive dialogue with allies on how to strengthen security in the Arctic, including the Golden Dome program, “provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity.” Danish officials noted that NATO doesn't have a mandate to negotiate a deal on behalf of Denmark and Greenland. The U.S. is already party to a 1951 treaty that gives it broad rights to set up military bases there with the consent of Denmark and Greenland. NATO spokesperson Allison Hart said the alliance's secretary general, Mark Rutte, “did not propose any compromise to sovereignty during his meeting with President Trump.” She said that negotiations between Denmark, Greenland and the U.S. “will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold - economically or militarily - in Greenland.” “Until yesterday, we couldn't rule out anything,” he told reporters in the island's capital, Nuuk. He pointed to a working group that the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers agreed with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to set up last week, before Trump threatened tariffs. On the streets of Copenhagen, some were skeptical about Trump's switch. “I think the man has said many things and done a lot of different things to what he says,” said Louise Pedersen, 22, who works with a startup company. She said it's for Greenlanders to decide what happens with their land — “not Donald Trump.” “I don't really trust anything Mr. Trump is saying,” said Poul Bjoern Strand, 70, who works in advertising. Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, one of the European countries that had faced Trump's threat of tariffs over Greenland, underlined the need for European NATO allies to do more to secure the Arctic region and stressed that it is “a common trans-Atlantic interest.” I welcome President Trump's remarks from last night — this is the right way to go.” Frederiksen traveled to the United Kingdom on Thursday for talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said the “hard yards” of bolstering Arctic security can begin and credited Trump's “pragmatism” for withdrawing his tariff threats.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Ukraine talks: After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, US President Donald Trump said there's still “a ways to go” on ending Russia's war. Zelensky noted that documents aimed at stopping the conflict are “nearly ready” and also called out Europe for inaction. While Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reached a verbal understanding about Greenland yesterday, no document has been produced yet memorializing a future deal, sources say. • “Board of Peace”: Trump earlier unveiled his “Board of Peace,” which is tasked with rebuilding Gaza and resolving global conflicts, in a signing ceremony attended by fewer than 20 countries. Residents in Greenland have reacted cautiously to US President Donald Trump's apparent U-turn on using force to take control of the territory, welcoming his change of heart, while remaining skeptical about his actions. CNN's Nic Robertson spoke to residents in the capital Nuuk, finding a mix of relief and lingering anxiety driven by what many described as the US president's unpredictability. I don't know if we can trust him,” Nuuk resident Putsi told Robertson today. Another resident, Aqqalu Frederiksen, said he felt some reassurance after Trump signaled he would not use force to acquire the island, but stressed that doubts persist. Robertson also spoke to Greenlandic member of parliament Margrethe Thårup Andersen, asking whether the threat of Trump attempting to take over the territory had now passed. Despite those concerns, many Greenlanders said their trust lies firmly with Denmark, the European Union and Greenland's own government. Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Thursday that he wasn't sure “what's concrete” in US President Donald Trump's announced “framework” for a “future deal” on Greenland. Trump yesterday announced that he had achieved the new “framework” after a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. “What we have said from the beginning is we want a respectful, peaceful relationship and a strong partnership as an ally,” Nielsen said. The prime minister added that Greenland is open to any number of plans to further integrate into NATO, including through a “permanent mission” on the island, so long as any plans emerge from a baseline of “respect” for their sovereignty. “So, let's talk about it through the right channels, in a respectful manner. Then I'm sure we can work something out that benefits.” Greenland's sovereignty and territorial integrity is a “red line,” Nielsen continued. Earlier in the press conference, he told reporters that Greenland's position is clear. “To summarize, we choose the Kingdom of Denmark,” Nielsen said. Ukrainian, US and Russian officials are to hold a trilateral meeting in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced Thursday, in a sign that peace talks to end the war in Ukraine are intensifying. “We are at the moment when, I think, if all the sides will work a lot, we will end this war, but if somebody will play the games, I don't know who, but I'm just sharing with you. This was a very strident broadside by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky against European leaders he says have not done enough over the past year. They remain, he said, “in Greenland mode, maybe someone, somewhere will do something.” Zelensky thanked France and the UK for offering troops in the event of a peace deal, but otherwise tried to stir European leaders – still reeling from US President Donald Trump's whirlwind of noise around Greenland – into action to forge a new world order. Trump had floated such an idea late last year – and Russia rejected it. That it is now likely happening might suggest some progress in peace talks, if only on the procedural front. The speech's tone – defiant against a part of Europe that has been Zelensky's key support base – was designed to appeal to the White House. Parts of it would have pleased both US Vice-President JD Vance and Trump himself. Zelensky was complimentary about how Trump's snatching of Venezuela's former president Nicolas Maduro led to him facing trial in New York. But he reminded Europeans that Russia's President Vladimir Putin did not face a similar fate, and that the people of Iran had been left to face the brutality of their security forces. President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reached a verbal understanding about Greenland during their meeting yesterday, but no document has been produced yet memorializing a future deal, people familiar with their discussion told CNN. The deal framework also guarantees that Russia and China will be barred from any investments in Greenland and lays out an enhanced role for NATO in Greenland, they said. Two sources said another element of a possible deal is increased US access to Greenland's natural resources. Rutte on Thursday denied that he had discussed this issue with Trump directly. One person familiar with the discussions said Rutte did not want any formal documents prepared during his meeting with Trump because he was concerned they could leak — or be posted by Trump himself on social media. Trump earlier this week posted a private message Rutte sent to him ahead of their talks. The lack of any written documentation has caused some confusion among NATO allies about what was actually agreed upon. Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Globb urged European leaders to move forward in solidarity as they face the prospect of a new world order that shifts away from decades-long norms. Speaking to CNN's Becky Anderson, the statesman expressed his empathy for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying, “I understand rather well the frustration uttered by President Zelensky … I know the root cause for it, it's not a new thing.” The prime minister reflected positively on the bloc's recent response to US President Donald Trump's threat to raise tariffs on his NATO allies and annex Greenland from Denmark. “Europe is only strong when it's united,” he said, adding his approval of NATO's decision to hold out and defy Trump's demands. “In the last week, Europe finally showed some backbone,” he said. Globb joined British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, among much of Europe, in declining the US president's offer to sit on his newly founded “Board of Peace.” When asked about Trump's wish to have it  work with the United Nations, Globb said: “No mechanism can be … parallel to the United Nations.” But the diplomat was optimistic about where NATO will go next: “We, the allies, are still in time to sit down, talk amongst each other honestly, sincerely, perhaps even loudly. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed his Danish counterpart Mette Frederiksen to Chequers, his official country home outside London, today for a bilateral meeting, as Denmark faces continued pressure from the United States over Greenland. Frederiksen thanked Starmer for his support, calling Britain one of Denmark's “oldest and most important allies,” and stressed the importance of a strong alliance during what she described as a difficult period. “Everybody recognizes that it has been quite a difficult time for us and to know that you have good friends, strong allies, and that Europeans stand together, don't get divided and stick to, as you said, our common values even in a world that is changing rapidly is extremely important for all of us,” Frederiksen said, adding: “We gotta get by with a little help from our friends.” US President Donald Trump said he had a good meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Davos, Switzerland, today, but added that there's still “a ways to go” toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine. That's why the dialogue is maybe, it's not simple,” he said. Zelensky's comments came after his speech at the World Economic Forum, during which he called out European leaders on their inaction when it comes to the war in Ukraine, comparing it to their behavior surrounding Greenland in recent days. CNN's Kaitlin Collins explains more about what we know so far: Vice President JD Vance said the United States will “keep on trying to make sure that we secure that land mass” as he addressed the negotiations about US access to Greenland on Thursday. While Vance did not answer that directly, he stressed US national security interests in the island. “We would need control over the Arctic in order to shoot that missile down. Our entire missile defense system defends depends on that arctic security,” Vance said while taking questions from reporters in Toledo, Ohio. “Documents aimed at ending this war” against Ukraine are “nearly ready,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Davos, Switzerland, after meeting with US President Donald Trump today. Both US and Ukrainian teams are working on ending the conflict “almost every day,” Zelensky said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called out European leaders on their inaction when it comes to the war on Ukraine, comparing it to their behavior surrounding Greenland in recent days. “We have told our European partners multiple times — act now … but Europe still remains in ‘Greenland mode' — maybe someday, someone will do something,” the Ukrainian president said. “You either declare that European bases will protect the region from Russia and China and establish those bases, or you risk not being taken seriously,” Zelensky said about Greenland, echoing what US President Donald Trump has said about the security of the Arctic region. Zelensky warned of Russian warships “sailing freely around Greenland,” and he offered Urkaine's expertise and weapons “to ensure not one of those ships remains.” Europe is a “beautiful but fragmented” kaleidoscope of “small and middle” powers, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said during his speech at Davos, as he criticized the bloc of “looking lost.” “Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost trying to convince the US president to change, but he will not change,” he continued. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Europe is too reliant on the US for its security, as he questioned the response from NATO if Russia was to invade another European nation. He questioned who would respond if Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to invade Lithuania or strike Poland. Believe me, this question is everywhere in the minds of every European leader.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has criticized a lack of progress on establishing a special tribunal for Russian aggression at the International Criminal Court (ICC), as he said that “too often in Europe something else is more urgent than justice.” Zelensky made the comments in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, shortly after having a closed-door meeting with US President Donald Trump. “Many meetings have taken place but still Europe hasn't reached even the point of having a home for the tribunal, with staff and actual work happening inside.” Zelensky did however add that he was “grateful” to be working with partners on security guarantees for Ukraine after the war ends. President Donald Trump appeared to indicate that diplomatic channels between the US and Iran would reopen during a speech at the World Economic Forum earlier today. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged that thousands of Iranians were killed in the unrest, deaths he blamed on Trump without mentioning the brutal tactics of Iran's security forces. Following his remarks today, Trump refused to answer Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo when she tried to press him on whether he would reconsider if there was another deadly crackdown in Iran. “There's something psychological that if you're president, no matter how well you're doing, you don't do well in the midterms,” Trump told Fox Business in an interview from Davos, Switzerland, where the president attended the World Economic Forum. “I think we're probably end up in another Democrat shutdown.” Trump also said he would like to see a reconciliation package, but added that passing his budget could be hard given the thin GOP majority. “It's hard when you have a majority by three,” Trump said. He called out Republican Reps. Thomas Massie and Rand Paul who have previously broken with the party on major votes. President Donald Trump said today that the US will retaliate if European countries sell US stocks and bonds in response to the president's ambition of acquiring Greenland and his pressure campaign on NATO allies. When asked if he is worried that European countries will sell the stocks and bonds they have in the US, Trump said, “If that would happen, there would be, you know, big retaliation on our part. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Denmark — which maintains territorial control over Greenland — and its investment in the US are “irrelevant” after the European country's pension fund announced it would unwind its investment in US government bonds because of “poor government finances.” The $100 million makes up a very small portion of the $30.8 trillion US Treasury market but Denmark itself holds just under $10 billion worth of US bonds. President Donald Trump today touted US weapons as being the “best,” but urged defense companies to make them “faster.” Earlier this month, Trump threatened defense contracting companies, saying he would seek to limit stock buybacks and executive salaries unless they improve their delivery of weapons systems to the US military. President Donald Trump said today that he had a good meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but that there's still “a ways to go” toward ending its war with Russia. US President Donald Trump's “Board of Peace” signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland, has concluded, as talks about the future of Ukraine and Greenland remain ongoing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With many Americans still recovering from repeated snowstorms and bitter cold in the North, a new weekend storm could glaze roads, trees and power lines with damaging ice across much of the South. A digital billboard along Highway 75 warns of road preparations for upcoming inclement weather expected in the region Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026, in Richardson, Texas. Ice forms on a pier along Lake Michigan ona. ATLANTA (AP) — Millions of Americans from New Mexico to the Carolinas are bracing for a potentially catastrophic ice storm that could crush trees and power lines and knock out power for days, while Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Boston could see enough snow to make travel very difficult or nearly impossible, forecasters say. An estimated 123 million people were under Winter Storm Watches on Thursday, most of them in southern or northeastern states, the National Weather Service said. The storm, expected to begin Friday and continue through the weekend, is also projected to bring heavy snow and all types of wintry precipitation, including freezing rain and sleet. An atmospheric river of moisture could be in place by the weekend, pulling precipitation across Texas and other states along the Gulf Coast and continuing across Georgia and the Carolinas before heading northeast, forecasters said. In Washington, D.C., “the combination of heavy snow and ice alongside prolonged very cold temperatures presents a unique and significant risk to life and property across virtually the entire region,” forecasters said in the weather service's Washington/Baltimore office warned. The city uses other heavy machinery like skid steers and small excavators to clear roads, said James Caldwell, deputy director of public works. Jackson also has three trucks that carry salt and sand to spread across roads before freezing weather. The amount of ice — half an inch, or 1.27 centimeters — that can lead to a crippling ice storm, toppling trees and power lines to create widespread and long-lasting power outages. The latest forecasts from the weather service warn of the potential for a half-inch of ice or more for many areas, including parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Tennessee. Another snowplow in East Tennessee was named Snowlene after her classic hit song “Jolene” as part of a 2022 naming contest. The number of layers needed to keep warm in extreme cold. AP video journalist Mark Vancleave in Minnesota explains the benefits of all three — a base layer, a middle layer and an outer shell — in this video. The number of major U.S. hub airports in the path of the southern storm this weekend, when ice, sleet and snow could delay passengers and cargo: Dallas-Fort Worth; Atlanta; Memphis, Tennessee, and Charlotte, North Carolina. Still more major airports on the East Coast could see delays later, as the storm barrels east. “You've got to be very weather aware, and real smart about what you're doing,” said Charles Daniel, who drives a semitrailer across western Oklahoma. “One mistake can literally kill somebody, so you have to use your head,” he added. The city also has six trucks that spread brine, a mixture designed to melt wintry precipitation. Parts of at least 19 states in the storm's path were under winter storm watches by late Wednesday, with more watches and warnings expected as the system approaches. They include Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia. An estimated 55 million people are included in these winter storm watches, the weather service said. The degree in Fahrenheit when water freezes, equivalent to 0 Celsius. This is a magic number when it comes to winter weather, said Eric Guillot, a scientist at the weather service. If the temperature is slightly above 32, it will be mostly liquid. “When the weather forecast says, ‘feels like negative 34,' it's just a matter of covering skin and being prepared for it,” said Nils Anderson, who owns Duluth Gear Exchange, an outdoor equipment store in Duluth, Minnesota. The number of snowplows in the city of Chicago, where annual snowfall averages 37 to 39 inches (0.94 to 0.99 meters). The city also has 40 4x4 vehicles, and about 12 beet juice-dispensing trucks, according to Cole Stallard, Chicago's commissioner of Streets and Sanitation. The natural sugars of beet juice lower the freezing point of water, allowing salt mixtures to work at much lower temperatures and preventing refreezing, while also helping salt stick to the road longer. The number of miles added last year to snowplow routes in Nashville, Tennessee. That was done “to get deeper into our neighborhoods — roads that had never been plowed before,” said Alex Apple, a spokesperson for Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell. He said the agency also works with state partners and contractors to get more equipment when needed. In the Dallas area, “right now our main focus is treating our roadways in advance of the storm,” agency spokesperson Tony Hartzel said Wednesday. The state has 121 salt houses around the Arkansas, plus 600 salt spreaders and 700 snowplows, said Dave Parker, an agency spokesperson.</p>

Fox News Digital spoke with Ari Lightman, a digital media and marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University, on Casey Anthony's latest venture on Substack. Casey Anthony, often referred to as "America's most hated mom," is again weighing in on national politics, this time accusing the United States of systemic racism and sexism and claiming that White men are falsely portrayed as victims of discrimination. In a recent Substack post, Anthony argued that America has a "long-standing history of discriminating against anyone who is not a white man," citing slavery, voting rights, segregation, and civil rights legislation as evidence of what she described as entrenched inequality. Casey Anthony argued that America has a "long-standing history of discriminating against anyone who is not a white man." "The entire purpose of DEI is to ‘hire without regard to race, religion, and national origin' and to ‘take affirmative action' to ensure equal treatment," Anthony wrote, adding that claims White men are being penalized are "laughable and disgusting." Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier speaks at a campaign rally for Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears on Oct. 29, 2025 in New Baltimore, Virginia. She went on to criticize Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, accusing the state of attempting to roll back anti-discrimination policies and alleging that government leaders are prioritizing the protection of White men "at all costs." Anthony claimed White men are the only demographic group in the U.S. that has "never been marginalized" or faced systemic barriers to employment, healthcare or civil rights. Caylee Anthony was 2 when she vanished in June 2008. In a reply to Anthony's post, Uthmeier's deputy chief of staff, Jeremy Redfern, wrote on X: "If only Caylee was alive to see @AGJamesUthmeier fight for a true merit-based system free from discrimination, but she was denied that opportunity." In an opinion issued this week, Uthmeier concluded that Florida laws requiring race-based state action are unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. Casey Anthony reacts during her trial at the Orange County Courthouse in Orlando, Florida, May 26, 2011. The comments follow Anthony's recent criticism of federal authorities over the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, in which she accused the Trump administration and Vice President JD Vance of shielding federal agents from accountability. "There is no such thing as a federal law-enforcement officer having immunity because it is convenient for you and this Administration," Anthony wrote. "This applies to your Gestapo agents in ICE." A jury found her guilty of lying to law enforcement but not guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter or aggravated child abuse. Anthony has increasingly used her Substack platform to comment on law enforcement, civil rights and political issues. Fox News Digital has reached out to Anthony's attorney for comment.

MADRID (AP) — After back-to-back fatal train crashes sent shock waves through Spain, some good news arrived on Thursday: Boro, the missing dog, was found. Days earlier, Boro's owner Ana García issued a desperate plea to help find him after the dog bolted Sunday in the aftermath of the high-speed train crash in southern Spain that killed at least 45 people. García, 26, and her pregnant sister were traveling with Boro on the train that derailed. On Thursday, forest firefighters in southern Spain found the black-and-white pooch, and posted images that showed García with one of her legs in a brace embracing Boro. Sitting inside a car, she spoke to reporters. “Many thanks to all of Spain and everyone who has got involved so much,” she said. Any information is helpful,” about a dog that went missing during a train crash in Adamuz, southern Spain, Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026. For days, people had rallied online to find him, amplifying García's call by sharing video of an interview she had given to local media. Photos of Boro, a medium-sized black dog with white eyebrows, went viral alongside phone numbers for García and her family. Spanish television broadcasters and newspapers covered the search. García, her sister and the dog had been traveling Sunday by high-speed train from Malaga, their hometown in southern Spain, to the capital Madrid, when the tail of their train car jumped the rails for reasons that remain unclear, and smashed into another train. The collision killed dozens and injured more than 150 people. Rescue crews helped García and her sister out of the tilted train car. That's when she briefly saw Boro before he ran. Guardia Civil officers collect evidence next to the wreckage of train cars involved in a collision in Adamuz, southern Spain, Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026. “Please, if you can help, look for the animals,” a limping García told reporters at the time, choked up and holding back tears.

Joel Klatt and Colin Cowherd discuss the importance of Indiana winning the National Championship, and whether or not Miami can rebound following their loss. Indiana star quarterback Fernando Mendoza is not only a star on the field, but on LinkedIn, too.

Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams players were hyped as they listened to the national anthem ahead of their playoff game over the weekend, according to video from NFL Films. Jim Cornelison performed his epic rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Soldier Field. Bears defensive lineman Grady Jarrett was among those stunned by Cornelison's vocals. he said multiple times in the clip. "It's the biggest flag I've ever seen," he was heard telling quarterback Matthew Stafford.

It's not the first time that Cornelison left a mark on NFL fans this season. The 61-year-old is a regular at Chicago sporting events. He's been the Bears' national anthem singer since 2010. He has hit the ice for Chicago Blackhawks games since 2008 and has sung "Back Home Again in Indiana" before the Indianapolis 500 since 2017. Cornelison is just as popular outside of sports. He was a part of the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists in Chicago and sang at some of the most popular opera houses around the world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — Beth Brown was assigned to a major project at work when hardship struck. A few days later, her mother passed away. Brown, director of health and well-being at a company that provides employee mental health programs and absence management services, sent a note to the senior ComPsych director who was her partner on the project, explaining she would have to miss work to care for her daughter and to make funeral arrangements. “In the grand scheme of things, this is not important,” Brown recalled her colleague saying. I'll be there when you're back.” Hearing the kind words, Brown “felt like there was a brick taken off my chest.” The importance of treating others with kindness is one of the first lessons most parents and guardians try to teach children. But the skill sometimes falls by the wayside in work settings that encourage competition and where adults face deadlines and pressure. Financial worries and fears of layoffs also can stifle generous impulses. Perhaps that's why acts of kindness on the job often are so memorable for those on the receiving end. Molly MacDermot, director of special initiatives at Girls Write Now, a nonprofit mentorship and writing program, feels lucky to have a boss who was kind to her when MacDermot's father died eight years ago and her mother passed away six months ago. This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Here are some examples of kindness in action and ideas for spreading goodwill at work. Treating others with warmth and consideration may be especially meaningful at a time of heightened political divisions that has many people feeling like they have to choose sides, said Anna Malaika Tubbs, a sociologist and author of “The Three Mothers” and “Erased.” “Especially in a workplace, where you can level the playing field and really make sure people know, ‘Hey, you're welcome here and you're seen here,' that can really make a difference at a time when on a national level people feel really divided from each other,” Tubbs added. Organizing staff retreats where family members are welcome, bringing in guest speakers, starting book clubs and scheduling fun offsite activities like going to an escape room are ways to generate shared experiences and facilitate healthy dialogues, she said. The goal isn't “to erase political difference or erase being able to disagree with each other” but to promote a cultural shift by encouraging behavior and actions different from the ones that often get rewarded at work, Tubbs said. “What would look differently if we were collaborating with each other? Creating a supportive culture within an organization requires daily attention, said Maya Nussbaum, the founder of Girls Write Now and MacDermot's boss. She starts meetings with “heart warmers,” a time for staff members to share their thoughts on topics as simple as a favorite candle. She also encourages actively listening to different perspectives. Compassion can mean sharing hard truths in a tactful way. For example, it's challenging to let people know they aren't meeting performance expectations, but “sometimes kindness is getting out of your comfort zone and telling someone the truth so they can shine,” said Chantel Cohen, founder and CEO of Atlanta-based CWC Coaching and Therapy, a counseling and life coaching practice in Atlanta. When providing feedback as a manager, give specific examples to illustrate the behaviors that need improvement, she said. She learned a lot, but felt unrelenting pressure. “Having her pass by and say, ‘You did that really well today,' it just really uplifts the mood of the whole department and makes us ready to come in for the next challenges,” Cen said. Before scheduling a meeting, consider whether the goals can be accomplished another way. For example, a manager can tell a working group, here's what's on the agenda, take time to think about it and send your ideas in writing, Cohen suggested. “Sometimes, the gift of time is such a kindness,” she said. “Maybe you can't give your team time off right now, but what you could do a couple times a quarter is just say, ‘Hey we're going to skip tomorrow's meeting and here are the things I want you all to think about. Submit this in writing so that you can have the time for yourselves. Keeping meetings structured and focused also frees up time, Nussbaum said. Meher Murshed began dating a colleague, Anupa Kurian-Murshed, more than two decades ago when they both worked at Gulf News in Dubai. Life could have been very different,” Meher Murshed said.

Police tape and officers seen near the area of 19th Avenue and Baseline in Phoenix, Arizona, as officers responded to a shooting on Saturday, Nov. 22. He is being held on a $1 million bond and is scheduled to return to court on Jan. 23, records show. Authorities have not released details about a possible motive or whether the two men knew each other prior to the encounter. Kaster's family told FOX 10 Phoenix the shooting stemmed from what they described as a seemingly ordinary interaction inside the gas station. When Kaster intervened, the family said, Franklin shot him. Danny Lyn Kaster, 52, is shown with his dogs in an undated photo. Kaster was later killed in a shooting, authorities said. "He was killed in the most ordinary interaction," family members told the station, adding that "it could have been anyone." Kaster was taken to the hospital following the shooting but died shortly afterward, his family said. Loved ones told FOX 10 Phoenix they now want the world to know who Kaster was beyond the circumstances of his death, describing him as a special person whose life was taken far too soon. Police have not said whether surveillance video captured the shooting or whether a weapon has been recovered. Investigators are urging anyone with information about the shooting to contact Silent Witness (480-948-6377). Fox News Digital reached out to the Arizona Department of Corrections for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Members of “The Squad,” such as Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), were not interested in the truth, but rather in Trump-bashing, name-calling, and outlandish claims that exposing fraud was racist and Islamophobic. My message to the Oversight Committee was clear: This grandstanding nonsense is exactly what Minnesotans hate about Washington, D.C. Those partisan and hyperbolic insults are what got us into this mess. For years, Democratic leadership has minimized whistleblower reports and allowed fraud to grow. The Walz administration retaliated against those who spoke up by claiming they were racist or Islamophobic. To protect their political base at the expense of all Minnesotans. It is true that most of the fraud is in the Somali community, but it is also true that some of our best whistleblowers have been from the Somali community. Our committee has given whistleblowers a place to be heard, exposed the most egregious fraud, and demanded accountability from those in power. Here are the results and hard truths from my congressional testimony that struck a nerve with Walz, Keith Ellison, and Democrats in Congress: First, we are unearthing staggering amounts of fraud. There's been more than $300 million stolen in the Feeding Our Future child nutrition program scandal, and prosecutions have revealed that half of those indicted also ran other Medicaid-funded programs.Yet, despite this being publicly reported in 2023, Walz and his agencies have done nothing to stop those defendants from getting additional state money. We have now found fraud in multiple Medicaid programs, including autism centers, sober homes, non-emergency medical transportation, integrated community supports, and housing stabilization. Just last month, our committee uncovered credible allegations of fraud in two new areas: adult day services and assisted living. Federal prosecutors estimate the fraud could be an astronomical $9 billion. In the face of this refusal to act, we knew we had to take accountability and oversight into our own hands. We launched the Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight Committee, opened a portal for whistleblowers, held 15 hearings, and turned over credible allegations of fraud to federal prosecutors. The road map to stop fraud starts with culture. Next, fraud happens when basic internal controls are not followed. Third, states have to look at the interconnected web of providers with businesses in multiple program areas. Finally, it is important to say what is true and to stand up against fake allegations of racism or Islamophobia. But now is the time to get results. Because of our work, federal partners and prosecutors are seeking justice.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By Amy O'Kruk, Koko Nakajima, Renée Rigdon, Byron Manley, Janie Boschma, Sharif Paget and CJ Riculan, CNN Tensions are high in Minneapolis after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, in her SUV earlier this month. Good's death sparked outrage against ICE's continued presence and the Department of Homeland Security's aggressive tactics by armed, masked agents in the Twin Cities — in both immigration enforcement operations and crackdowns on protesters. DHS has poured thousands of federal agents into the cities, greatly outnumbering the combined sworn police officers that Minneapolis and St. Paul have, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said federal agents had arrested 3,000 “criminal” undocumented immigrants in Minnesota over the last six weeks, as of January 19. “DHS is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters,” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN. CNN reviewed and geolocated videos that demonstrate just some examples of federal agents' tactics in the Twin Cities. CNN obtained multiple angles of the fatal shooting by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. Noem said Good “weaponized” her vehicle and that the agent responded in defense of his life. Federal agents push back a crowd of protesters, shooting pepper balls at their feet and spraying an orange chemical irritant from a can, near the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building. According to CNN's Omar Jimenez, who was on the scene, law enforcement presence increased significantly after several instances of cars being hit with snow and ice, or protesters trying to block vehicles from leaving the facility. A man stops in front of an ICE vehicle as it begins moving. An ICE agent pushes the man, causing him to fall into oncoming traffic. After being detained the man is carried away and placed in an SUV. DHS said the US citizen was arrested after he didn't comply with the order to stay back and responded by hitting an officer. DHS said officers “were swarmed by approximately 100 agitators who surrounded law enforcement and began throwing objects at them, threatening them, blocking their exit, and impeding their lawful operations. DHS said she was arrested for obstruction after ignoring commands to move her vehicle away from the scene. Agent detains US citizen after he refuses to show ID requested “because of your accent” Ramon Menera was detained outside his home in a Minneapolis suburb in front of his 5-year-old daughter after a US Border Patrol agent accused him of not being a US citizen because of his accent, he told CNN. DHS told CNN an agent recognized his accent as being from Mexico and that Menera initially lied to agents about where he was born. Agents let Menera go after reviewing his paperwork, he said. Protesters clashed with law enforcement after an ICE agent shot a person in the leg who DHS said had assaulted one of its officers earlier in the evening. The video shows multiple explosions and gas as protesters disperse. A family on their way home from their son's basketball game found themselves trapped in a protest and were tear gassed in their car, resulting in the mother having to administer CPR to her infant, she told CNN. Dramatic video shows the family evacuating their car and fleeing to a nearby home. Photographer tells CNN about being detained, pepper sprayed by federal agents John Abernathy, an independent photographer, tells CNN he was hit from behind by "three ICE guys" during a protest outside the Whipple Federal Building. Abernathy said agents set tear gas in front of him and sprayed pepper spray into his face. DHS said he was arrested for obstructing pedestrian and vehicle traffic on federal property.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Mary Miller (R-IL) introduced legislation on Wednesday to help people achieve the American dream of owning a home. Miller's legislation proposes restrictions on large corporations, companies, and investors to prevent them from “crowding families out of homes.” Miller's American Family Housing Act calls to amend the “Investment Company Act of 1940 to prohibit certain large-scale companies from purchasing single-family residences.” The bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to limit the number of single-family homes that “large institutional investors” can buy so that ordinary working-class families can afford to purchase houses at reasonable prices. Miller's American Family Housing Act comes on the heels of President Donald Trump's executive order “Stopping Wall Street From Competing With Main Street Homebuyers,” issued on Jan. 20. Trump's order also prioritized housing affordability for everyday people over investment firms purchasing properties. “Hardworking young families cannot effectively compete for starter homes with Wall Street firms and their vast resources,” read Trump's directive. “My Administration will take decisive action to stop Wall Street from treating America's neighborhoods like a trading floor and empower American families to own their homes.” Miller presented the numerous challenges people face when purchasing a home in the country today as justification for her bill in a press release on Wednesday. “A 2024 Government Accountability Office study estimated that institutional investors collectively own roughly 300,000 homes nationwide, with ownership heavily concentrated in metropolitan areas. “President Trump is right to confront this crisis, and my American Family Housing Act ensures homes are owned by families, not large institutional investors,” Miller said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One day after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis earlier this month, a Minnesota immigrant advocacy group reported a threefold increase in the number of people signing up to become legal observers. “To say this: The killing of Renee Good lit a fire under the community, would be an understatement,” said Ryan Perez, a leadership and organizing director with the advocacy group COPAL, part of a network of 5,000 trained civilians who monitor immigration enforcement. Volunteers document arrests, some tail ICE agents in vehicles, while others blow whistles warning community members of ICE enforcement –– tactics under increased scrutiny since the fatal shooting, which has led to more aggressive enforcement operations and sparked protests across the US. Good, who served on the board of her son's school, was linked, in school documents, to similar activities encouraging parents to monitor and possibly disrupt ICE operations –– an association Trump officials are placing at the center of their review into the incident as the activist and mother of three partially blocked ICE agents with her car. Woman dragged from car by ICE speaks exclusively to CNN Videos of the encounter show Good was turning her vehicle away from the agent as she pulled forward, but it is unclear whether she made contact with him before he fired. Experts say while some practices by volunteers are acts of nonviolent civil disobedience, others may fall into murkier legal territory. CNN's Isabel Rosales went on a ride-a-long with residents who are monitoring federal agents in real time. They are part of a network of five thousand civilians called "legal observers" who are responding to tips that immigration enforcement is around. Across the country, thousands of parents, teachers, clergy members and community organizers have sought training on what they can legally do when they see an immigration arrest. They have been trained on documenting federal immigration agents' actions with cell phone video and quickly warning migrant neighbors with whistles and car horns. Kateri Heymans, a 29-year-old Spanish teacher in Minneapolis, registered as an observer the day after Good was fatally shot. She said she was alarmed by the number of  federal agents flooding her hometown and the violent scenes that have accompanied their presence. “After the killing of Renee Nicole Good, our volunteers are asking, ‘Can they get away with this?' They see an administration labeling legal observers as ‘domestic terrorists' and feel a target on their backs.” Critics of the immigration crackdown say observers are necessary given what they describe as dangerous tactics by federal agents which put people at risk. Officers exercise restraint despite facing threats and attacks, according to federal officials. And all of that creates a legal record as well,” Perez said. “If you're in a public space, using whistles to signal that law enforcement officers are present and recording law enforcement activities are expressive activities protected by the First Amendment,” said Gregory Magarian, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Tim Zick, a professor at William and Mary Law School in Virginia, said some volunteers have sought to identify mostly masked ICE officers by badge numbers or other accessible information, occasionally posting information about their identities online. Distribution of factual and lawfully obtained public information is generally protected by the First Amendment, according to Zick. “The Trump administration has initiated investigations and prosecutions of some activists who have posted information about agents online or distributed it,” Zick said. Trump officials investigate protesters who interrupted Minnesota church service, targeting ICE official “If the information is posted with the intent or purpose of inciting violence against agents or threatening them, it may not be protected. President Donald Trump has warned leaders in Minnesota he may be forced to intervene further if widespread protests continue during his administration's surge in immigration enforcement operations. ICE watch activities and protests appear to be escalating as aggressive arrests become more common in public, with some federal officers using tactics such as shattering car windows and tackling their targets. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has said agents who “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law” are facing “smearing” by claims they're employing “harsher approaches.” “Our officers are highly trained in de-escalation tactics and regularly receive ongoing use of force training.” “If a person directly interferes with a law enforcement officer, for example by deliberately blocking the officer's path, that is not protected by the First Amendment and is generally unlawful,” Magarian said. Zick said posting threats to federal agents is unlawful and not protected speech. “So is inciting others to engage in unlawful actions against the agents, if the incitement is likely to produce an imminent attack,” he added. 1,500 soldiers on standby for possible Minnesota deployment, source says, as state mobilizes National Guard Perez, the Minneapolis activist who trains ICE watchers, said his group instructs volunteers to stay eight feet away from agents and to avoid touching or blocking them. “We have a 100% no obstruction protocol as observers,” he insisted. Perez added, “We have people that were so afraid before and I think the fear is still there. There's so much violence from law enforcement against community members and yet there's also more bravery than ever … because people are feeling like, ‘Now's my time to act.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2015, China handed back something of great value to Ai Weiwei: his Chinese passport. For the past 10 years Ai has lived in Germany, the UK and now Portugal, never once setting foot in his native country, where people with far less controversial pasts have faced arbitrary detention. But in mid-December, he decided to take the risk, returning for a three-week visit. “It felt like a phone call that had been disconnected for 10 years suddenly reconnecting,” he said of the instant he arrived into Beijing. “The tone, rhythm and speed, all returned to how they were before.” Still images show the artist lifting dumbbells at an indoor gym and catching up with old friends – the ordinary becoming somewhat extraordinary when compared to how intensely he was surveilled by authorities when he was last in China's capital. “What I missed most was speaking Chinese,” he said. “For immigrants, the greatest loss is not wealth, loneliness or an unfamiliar lifestyle, but the loss of linguistic exchange.” When Ai left in 2015, he was a thorn on the government's side. The outspoken artist and activist relentlessly criticized China on everything from alleged human rights abuses to censorship and corruption, with artworks such as “Remembering” (2009) – an installation commemorating the thousands of children killed under the collapse of shoddily-constructed school buildings during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake – gaining international attention. In “S.A.C.R.E.D,” he depicted what it was like to be imprisoned for nearly three months, in the form of six life-sized dioramas that debuted at the 2013 Venice Biennale. Such pieces came at a time when – in the years after the 2008 Beijing Olympics – officials carefully projected a new era of Chinese development and aggressively cracked down on any dissent. In the decade Ai has been away, China's censorship and surveillance efforts have only grown more sophisticated, with critics now fearing that artificial intelligence is turbocharging these systems of control. But now his son is almost 17 years old, he no longer bears the same weight of parental responsibility – and feels “relatively freer” to act of his own accord. Poignant photos from the trip shared with CNN show the father and son walking out of Beijing Capital International Airport, as well as reuniting with Ai's 93-year-old mother. “I am not familiar with this kind of feeling, and it surprised me,” he added. Ai didn't take any specific precautions when planning the trip but was “inspected and interrogated” for almost two hours at Beijing's airport before he was allowed to pass immigration. “The questions were very simple: How long do you plan to stay here? The fact that rest of the 68-year-old's visit was “smooth and, one could say, pleasant” may signal authorities' confidence on a number of fronts: a Chinese public that is increasingly unfamiliar with the artist as his name and works have been largely censored on the country's social media platforms; and in the expansive reach of their surveillance technologies. Politically, there might also be little to gain from the international outcry that would arise were the high-profile artist detained or prevented from entering Beijing. The red lines in China, as always, are vague and fast-evolving. But he has also gone to great lengths to make art of what's in front of him: the global refugee crisis and, more recently, the war in Ukraine. “Rather, it comes from my long-term public work in expressing my views… Although a country or group may disagree with my positions, they at least recognize that I speak sincerely and not for personal gain.” He believes China is “in an upward phase,” pointing to individual wealth, national strength and personal freedoms, though discussing political topics remains taboo. Values once celebrated now appear hollow and collapsed. The West increasingly struggles to sustain its own logic; in many areas it has lost its ethical authority and descended into something barely recognizable.” So does he plan on moving back to China anytime soon? “I have never truly left anywhere; the distance has simply grown longer,” Ai explained. But it's his Chinese passport that keeps him rooted. “Even when I lived under great difficulty, I still felt that this identity gave me the fundamental right to return to my place of birth.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he reached a framework for a deal with NATO over the future of Greenland that will include rights to rare-earth minerals. “They're going to be involved in mineral rights, and so are we,” Trump said about NATO and the United States in an interview with CNBC after the initial announcement on Truth Social. But Greenland's untapped mineral wealth has helped land the island at the top of Trump's empire-building wish list. Trump officials view Greenland's underground riches as a way to loosen China's stranglehold over the rare-earth metals that are critical for everything from fighter jets and lasers to electric vehicles and MRI scanners. Trump has downplayed Greenland's natural resources, including in his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Wednesday, when he said acquiring rare-earth minerals wasn't the reason America needed the territory. But hours later, Trump said the deal for Greenland included two parts: his “Golden Dome” missile defense concept and minerals. That tracks with what his former national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News in 2024, when Waltz said that the administration's focus on Greenland was “about critical minerals” and “natural resources.” Researchers say it would be extremely difficult and expensive to extract Greenland's minerals because many of the island's mineral deposits are located in remote areas above the Arctic Circle, where there is a mile-thick polar ice sheet and darkness reigns much of the year. Not only that, but Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark, lacks the infrastructure and manpower required to make this mining dream a reality. “The idea of turning Greenland into America's rare-earth factory is science fiction. It's just completely bonkers,” said Malte Humpert, founder and senior fellow at The Arctic Institute. “You might as well mine on the moon. In some respects, it's worse than the moon.” Despite its name, approximately 80% of Greenland is covered with ice. And mineral extraction — or just about anything — in the Arctic can be five to 10 times more expensive than doing it elsewhere on the planet. Trump's interest in Greenland is not new — nor is he the first US president to covet the island. For years, if not decades, officials in Greenland have courted foreign direct investment. People in Greenland say they already are open to business opportunities without any belligerence. “If there was a ‘pot of gold' waiting at the end of the rainbow in Greenland, private businesses would have gone there already,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. However, Funk Kirkegaard, who previously worked with the Danish Ministry of Defense, said it's just “very difficult” to make a business case for the very large upfront investment that would be required. “If given enough taxpayer dollars, private business would be willing to do almost anything,” Funk Kirkegaard said. The climate crisis has caused melting ice and rapidly rising temperatures in the Arctic, leading some to hope for new economic opportunities. However, it's too early to say this will be enough of a game-changer to overcome the environmental challenges of mining in Greenland. While ice melt has opened up some shipping routes, it has also made the ground less stable to drill and raises the risk of landslides. This is not the Mediterranean or your bathtub. There's just less ice freeze,” said Humpert of The Arctic Institute. Relatedly, Greenland's stringent environmental regulations would add expense and difficulty to widespread mining. If the Trump administration somehow made those regulations disappear, it might prove deeply unpopular. “You could end up having a hostile local political situation,” Funk Kirkegaard said. Adam Lajeunesse, chair in Canadian and Arctic policy at St. Francis Xavier University, said Trump's “bizarre rhetoric” about taking over Greenland risks undermining the economic and strategic objectives US officials by harming the relationship with Greenland and Denmark. “You could see the United States no longer viewed as a friend and partner but as a bully that should be resisted,” he said. To some extent, this may already be happening. “At the moment, everything American is a red flag,” he said. “Everyone is wondering, ‘Am I supporting someone taking over my country?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily declined to allow the FBI to examine electronics it seized from a Washington Post reporter's home. U.S. Magistrate Judge William B. Porter ruled the agency is permitted to keep Hannah Natanson's two phones, two laptops, a recorder, a portable hard drive, and a Garmin watch that it seized from her residence last week. The agency obtained them last week by executing a search warrant. It sought to investigate the items as part of an inquiry into a Pentagon contractor accused of illegally retaining classified documents. The outlet warned that the seizure “flouts the First Amendment and ignores federal statutory safeguards for journalists.” It was that motion that Porter weighed in on during his ruling Wednesday. The case began after the DOJ accused Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland who has a top-secret security clearance, of retaining classified national defense materials. A DOJ official said the suspect was messaging Natanson when he was arrested earlier this month, according to the Washington Post, which also reported that Natanson said she communicated with Perez-Lugones through Signal and phone. Attorney General Pam Bondi has accused Natanson of reporting on classified information she garnered from Perez-Lugones. I am proud to work alongside Secretary Hegseth on this effort. The Trump Administration will not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation's national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>William Kelly, an anti-Trump agitator traveling across the country to sites of political conflict, appeared to be a central figure in the shutdown of Sunday services at Cities Church, a Christian parish in St. Paul, Minnesota. Kelly, alongside a mob of activists, allegedly stormed Cities Church over the weekend, disrupting a Sunday sermon based on allegations that one of the pastors, David Easterwood, is an ICE official. Afterward, on social media, Kelly said he had “the honor of protesting David Easterwood's church with Nekima Armstrong and the Racial Justice Network!” Armstrong later thanked Kelly and former CNN host Don Lemon in a Facebook post for their efforts. Lemon, Kelly, and other “independent journalists” were reportedly privy to operational plans kept under wraps until the so-called “surprise operation” actually unfolded. Notably, when the activists initially assembled in a nearby parking lot, the protest's staging grounds, Lemon met them there and began livestreaming before they barged into Cities Church that morning. Kelly, during the demonstration, filmed himself directly confronting lead pastor Jonathan Parnell and shouting in the faces of parishioners, even following them to their cars with crying children in tow. A staple in the anti-ICE activism scene, Kelly appears at pop-up protests all around the country, deploying confrontational tactics intended to provoke his political opponents. Most recently, Kelly left Minneapolis for an anti-Tesla rally in downtown Los Angeles on Jan. 16, took a red-eye flight to Chicago for a protest outside an ICE facility on Jan. 17, and jetted back to Minneapolis in time for the Cities Church occupation on Jan. 18. In a message to supporters, Kelly told his followers, “I plan on organizing some larger movements across the country! I will do my best to come support every city being attacked by fascism!” Kelly, known as “DaWoke Farmer” on TikTok, crowdfunds financing for his cross-country trips through a standing campaign on GoFundMe, originally titled “Help Me to Continue Agitating the Nazis.” Lemon, in particular, has been put “on notice” by Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, chief of the DOJ's civil rights division, for possible violations of the FACE Act, a federal law protecting places of worship from protests. As seen on Lemon's livestream, the former CNN host bought donuts and coffee at a Starbucks location and then distributed them to protesters. “Whoever paid for, coordinated, or participated in this attack made a big—BIG—mistake,” Harmeet warned. “No worshipper in this country should ever feel intimidated in a house of God, and @TheJusticeDept will bring the full force of the law, as directed by [Attorney General Pam Bondi].” In response, Kelly said he was protesting “a white supremacist church.” “F**k ‘em!” Kelly reacted, dismissing the DOJ investigation and further challenging federal officials to arrest him. In an expletive-filled video statement, Kelly claimed that Muslim immigrants in Minnesota are not able to pray without the fear of ICE raiding their mosques. “How do they deserve any f**king different?” Kelly said, referring to the Christian churchgoers. Come and get me, Pam Bondi, you f**king traitorous b*tch.” Calling the threats of charges “baseless,” Kelly said his lawyers assured him that he would prevail should prosecutors bring a case against him. Justin Overbaugh, the U.S. deputy undersecretary of war for intelligence and security, informed Bondi on X that Kelly has also been part of a mob that routinely harasses congregants at Christ Church, a parish attended by War Secretary Pete Hegseth in Washington, D.C. Last month, Kelly captured on camera one of his profanity-laden confrontations with Hegseth. Some of Kelly's other past targets include members of the National Guard, whom he heckled near Union Station less than two weeks after two troops were ambushed by gunfire in the nation's capital. Kelly was arrested in December for allegedly stalking a random father, calling the man “a Nazi piece of sh*t” while his children watched. According to Kelly, investigators are “moving forward with disorderly conduct charges” against him. Dhillon confirmed that Kelly was recently arrested and released days prior to the Cities Church protest in Minnesota for allegedly impeding ICE. After authorities set him free on Friday, Kelly claimed that he was “kidnapped by ICE.” Kelly told the Washington Examiner that he is now suing the Department of Homeland Security on wrongful arrest and excessive violence claims in connection to Friday's arrest.</p>
