                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, FIFA announced it received more than 500 million requests for tickets — with each request being an application for one to four seats at a specific game — during the month-long sales window, which has just closed. “We had over 500 million ticket requests — half a billion ticket requests,” Infantino said, speaking at a World Cup-themed session of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos on Thursday We were hammered — I was hammered, I should say — because of the ticket prices, because they are so expensive. “The main critics were from Germany and England, of course. The German and English markets, however, were not second only to the U.S., as FIFA has already explained that applications from all three co-hosts — Canada, Mexico and the U.S. — beat those from anywhere else. Infantino went on to talk about the use of resale sites, a point that may raise questions around the world, particularly in countries where the reselling of tickets is either banned or strictly controlled. “In the U.S., it is perfectly legal to resell tickets on resale platforms — there is a law for that, so we have to allow (it),” he explained. FIFA has denied suggestions that many of the 500 million requests have come from automated bots, stating that every request was “validated by unique credit card data”. Regardless of whether the reseller is real or not, FIFA stands to profit, as it will be charging 15 per cent commissions on both the seller and buyer of any ticket on its own resale platform. This means it will make $30 from the sale of a $100 ticket, although there will not be many priced that cheaply. This is a significant increase on the fees it has charged in previous tournaments but Infantino has justified FIFA's pricing decisions by saying they are normal for the host market. Furthermore, he believes if FIFA did not price things with the American consumer in mind, it would be handing money over to private companies with no interest in funding football development projects. Resale platforms are an integral part of the U.S. sports and entertainment scene, with American fans used to dynamic pricing, where the cost of tickets can rise and fall based on demand, and tolerant of high prices for premium events. And while the vast majority of that money will be shared with its 211 member associations, this expanded World Cup is already guaranteed to make record profits even without the unprecedented increase in ticket prices. “We'll see ticket requests from all 211 countries, from all over the world, and those persons who purchase tickets will have what we call — what we agreed with the American administration — a FIFA PASS so they can go to get their visa in a fast-track process. “So, all those things we read are not true when it comes to the World Cup, because America, and when I speak about America, I speak about Canada, Mexico and the United States, will welcome the world next summer, and this is what we're looking forward to. The greatest not just sports event, but the greatest show that our planet has ever seen and probably will ever see.” Questions remain over whether fans from some participating countries will be allowed to attend, as the U.S. government's crackdown on immigration has seen Haiti, Iran, Ivory Coast and Senegal added to its banned list.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Welcome back to World Cup Countdown—The Ringer's monthly column previewing the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Morocco hadn't won Africa's top soccer prize since 1976, and the eager home fans in Rabat were waiting to erupt. For reasons that we may never fully comprehend, Diaz tried a Panenka penalty. Senegal's Pape Gueye scored four minutes into the extra period, and the Lions of Teranga won their second AFCON title in three tries. You won't find a soccer tournament that's more consistently competitive and exhilarating than the one AFCON puts on every two years—although it looks like that frequency could be changing. In 2023, Ivory Coast fired its coach mid-tournament before going on to win it. In 2015, Ivorian goalkeeper Boubacar “Barry Copa” Barry not only saved two penalties but also converted the winning kick in a 22-attempt shoot-out against Ghana. AFCON was a reminder that when you concentrate all that energy into a single-elimination international event, one moment can tilt the trajectory of an entire country's sporting year. They are also the top two African teams if you rate each squad by average transfermarkt value. The Lions of Teranga will face off against both France and Norway in their group, which is unquestionably the most difficult on paper. Sadio Mané said that this was his final AFCON tournament, which will also likely make 2026 his World Cup send-off for the national team. Egypt will go as far as Mo Salah and Omar Marmoush can carry it, while Algeria and Ghana have proved in past generations that they can compete with some of the world's top heavyweights. And getting more time with their national teammates could prove to be an advantage for the seven African teams that got a trial run at tournament soccer before the World Cup in four months. Mauricio Pochettino voicing directions to his players during an international friendly game between Japan and the USMNT There are a handful of players who should rightfully be seen as locks, but the starting XI remains murky. The starting goalkeeper job is his to lose now. His heroics in goal for NYCFC last season helped lead the New Yorkers to the MLS Cup conference finals, so American fans shouldn't expect another keeper to supplant him in the USMNT's rotation before June. His only real competition is expected to be Matt Turner, who didn't even make the November roster and has been struggling to find consistent minutes under Pochettino. Pochettino tested out a back three formation on multiple occasions in the second half of 2025. And operating with only three defenders does seem to better fit the tactical strengths of some of his personnel, freeing up his more creative wide players to attack more as wingbacks instead of sitting back like more traditionally conservative fullbacks. Finding a suitable partner who will play to his level might be difficult, but Mark McKenzie, Ream, or Miles Robinson could be called on to compete alongside him in that back three. Antonee Robinson returned from injury in December and has started seven consecutive league games for Fulham. Robinson's crossing ability was among the best in the Premier League in the last two seasons he was healthy (in 2023-24 and 2024-25), and he's an incredibly active defender.Both Alex Freeman and Max Arfsten have had various standout moments filling in for Sergiño Dest and Robinson, but Dest—who has been solid for PSV Eindhoven when healthy—and Robinson provide the most forward thrust and attacking quality from the wingback position. He suffered the injury in Bournemouth's game against Manchester United in mid-December and was expected to miss three months, which should give him more than enough time to get into top fitness before the tournament. However, given Adams's extensive injury history, his health is far from a certainty.The USMNT has tried different players in the central midfield role in his absence, but none have come close to matching his defensive tenacity and ball-winning ability. Cristian Roldan seems to be one of Pochettino's favorites; the Seattle Sounders stalwart started three of the USMNT's five friendlies to conclude 2025. But Weston McKennie's pedigree and ceiling could ultimately convince Pochettino to start him in the World Cup. The USMNT veteran has appeared in 20 of 21 games for Juventus this year—the real question may be what his best role is with the American squad and whether he's more suited to playing farther forward. Pochettino really seemed to like Malik Tillman's pressing intensity and energy at the Gold Cup last summer. But if the Argentine is set on playing a back three, he'll want an attacking midfielder who can complement Dest. Now he's also putting up the goals to prove it. He scored three times in his three fall starts for the USMNT and has seven goals combined in Ligue 1 and the Champions League this season. This section focuses on the shifting fortunes of players, managers, characters, and nations who could play a significant role next summer. Xabi Alonso during the Spanish Super Cup final between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid Online tacticos, analytics nerds, and soccer commentators alike have been plenty critical of former Real Madrid managers Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane for their lack of tactical acumen while managing the team. But Xabi Alonso flamed out of the job in 233 days, maybe proving that Zidane's and Ancelotti's skills as managers and leaders of soccer's biggest megastars were underrated after all. Alonso struggled to get the dressing room to believe in his vision, and players reportedly described him as “distant and unapproachable.” Alonso's run at Bayer Leverkusen—including an undefeated season in the Bundesliga—was extremely impressive, but it's a much different challenge stepping up to manage one of the most successful clubs in the world. Will a new hire happen before this summer's tournament? Would Ancelotti come back after managing Brazil at the World Cup? And since Zidane is reportedly eyeing managerial duties for his native France when Didier Deschamps leaves his post, could Madrid still be searching for their man in August? The soccer analytics community lost a valued resource this week when Sports Reference announced that “the provider of our advanced soccer data sent us a letter terminating our access to their data feeds.” FBref has long been one of the most abundant and accessible data sources in the sporting world. It truly feels like the end of an era—and a significant loss for analysts, writers, and fans alike. FBref has done incredible work to help the layperson better understand a sport that is notoriously complex and difficult to quantify and will be sorely missed. Zohran Mamdani after a press conference announcing his petition urging FIFA to drop dynamic ticket pricing for next summer's World Cup New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani did something rare for an American politician: He's actually demonstrated elite ball knowledge. Mamdani hosted a watch party on Sunday in Manhattan's Surrogate's Court for the wild AFCON final between Senegal and Morocco. He's also made the World Cup a major focus of his first year in office.Not only has Mamdani said that he intends to ask President Donald Trump to reconsider travel bans, but he's also vowed to appoint a “World Cup czar” in an attempt to lower ticket prices for fans attending games. And when CBS Sports interviewed him on his wisdom of the game, he surpassed expectations with deep-cut references to famous African soccer icons. Perhaps we shouldn't have expected anything less from the guy who grew up playing soccer on the Upper West Side and who gained the affection of his Brooklyn recreational soccer league teammates before being elected mayor. Ruben Amorim on the sideline during a Premier League match between Aston Villa and Manchester United He said, “I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United and that is clear” in a press conference on January 4. The last image fans had of Amorim was him smiling wide and dapping up a member of the paparazzi as he left his home. If his replacement, club favorite Michael Carrick, can keep the vibes high at United, Amorim won't be the only one cheesing in Manchester.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After criticism of Qatar's human rights record resurfaced amid reports it could host a future Women's Club World Cup, FIFA chief football officer Jill Ellis tried to deflect. Imagine the mental gymnastics it takes to accuse the United States of being "anti-gay" while bending over backward to defend Qatar. Yet that's exactly what FIFA executive Jill Ellis did this week when asked about growing criticism of Qatar as a potential host nation for a future Women's Club World Cup. So when Ellis, the former U.S. Women's National Team coach and now FIFA's chief football officer, was asked whether those realities should factor into FIFA's decision-making, she didn't actually answer the question. Instead, she tried to flip it back on the United States. "I'm going to put my personal hat on. There are over 500 bills in the U.S. with anti-gay legislation on them," Ellis said. "I also come from the U.S., but right now there's a big light being shown on that. That might be one of the most disingenuous takes I've heard. Women in Qatar are not treated as legal equals to men. They are subject to male guardianship laws that govern marriage, divorce, travel and family life. Under Qatar's personal status law, wives are legally obligated to "obey" their husbands. Women can lose financial support if they refuse sex or work without their husband's permission. In some cases, unmarried Qatari women under 25 must obtain male guardian permission to travel abroad. Male relatives can request travel bans on female family members through the state. Now an executive for FIFA, Jill Ellis is the winningest coach in USWNT history, leading the team to two consecutive FIFA Women's World Cup titles in 2015 and 2019. Liberal women in the United States can don their performative Handmaid's Tale costumes all they want. But what's happening in Qatar is actual second-class citizenship for women, written directly into law. Unlike the United States, where same-sex relationships and marriages are legal nationwide, homosexuality is criminalized in Qatar. Consensual same-sex sexual activity can be punished with prison sentences. We saw this play out during the 2022 Men's World Cup in Qatar, when players were threatened with punishment for wearing "One Love" armbands — a threat FIFA itself enforced, by the way. Midfielder from Belgium with the ONE LOVE armband during a team photo session ahead of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. Let's contrast Qatar's laws with what Ellis lumped together as "anti-gay legislation" in the United States. But when you dig into those bills, the narrative really begins to fall apart. If you want to disagree with any of these policy proposals, be my guest. But calling them "anti-gay" is a gross mischaracterization. None of them make it illegal to be gay or transgender. None of them impose prison sentences based on whom you choose to love, marry or sleep with. Good thing they don't live in Qatar. Ellis framed her comments as a warning against hypocrisy — the idea that Americans shouldn't criticize Qatar because the United States supposedly has its own "anti-gay" problem. With even a little bit of scrutiny, that framing collapses immediately. She's comparing American legislative debates to a country where women lack basic legal autonomy and homosexuality is a crime. German players covered their mouths during the team photo before their Qatar 2022 World Cup opener against Japan to protest FIFA's ban on wearing the "One Love" anti-discrimination armband. The bills Ellis is referring to are not about criminalizing gay people, jailing adults for consensual relationships or erasing civil rights. They are about defining sex as a biological reality in law and shielding children from sexually explicit material and irreversible medical interventions. The United States is debating how best to balance competing interests in a pluralistic society. Qatar throws human rights to the wind and enforces hierarchy by law.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unprecedented times call for previously unthinkable conversations when it comes to the US-shaped problem Could European countries really decide to boycott the World Cup this summer? It is an astonishing question to be asking in 2026 and an indictment of the bind in which, as Donald Trump sows confusion around a potential annexation of Greenland, the world's most popular sport finds itself. While flexibility is essential in a volatile, fast-moving situation, there is an acceptance that no one can afford to be asleep if the time for action comes. That is why there is a growing belief that Europe's governing bodies, whether led by individual federations or by Uefa itself, must cohere behind a common position – or at least prepare one. Sources have described a tightening of unity since Trump, whose suggestion on Wednesday he will not take Greenland by force – and later that there was the outlines of a deal – must surely be treated with caution. While some federations are understood to have been relatively unbothered by the spectacle of Trump receiving a peace prize from the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, in December, choosing in certain cases to find a funny side, the gravity of current events is lost on no one. There is a consensus that Fifa has chosen to politicise itself; that could bring consequences if the US president intensifies his designs on a territory that belongs, indisputably, to a Uefa member in Denmark. Russia was quickly frozen out of international competition after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, essentially because other countries refused to compete against them. In the event Trump's latest pronouncements stand the test of time, it means any whispers about a boycott will remain hushed for now. None of Europe's FAs are in a rush to go public with a stance and plenty may follow their governments' positions. The question is whether that would be enough for those who feel football has a unique opportunity to assert itself. There are certainly some within football's corridors of power who feel a stand could be made while politicians prevaricate. Trump has wedded himself to the World Cup project since his first term, naturally making mention of his own hard work in steering the bid when it succeeded in 2018. The prospect of visible, palpable damage to his latest big moment would not be easy for the president to stomach. Perhaps, if Uefa and its federations flexed their muscles, Infantino could even feel compelled to engage in far-reaching diplomacy with his friend around the Greenland problem. Some within Uefa would strain at the leash to see Infantino put in his place. More moderate forces close to the organisation may not favour incendiary moves this time, with the future of global football facing enough uncertainty, but the sport has been planted in uncharted waters and could find it needs to swim hard. The hypotheticals continue but they cannot be purely dismissed as such. Recent events have underlined that football's leadership must be agile and the message is hitting home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With six starts since her first call-up to a January training camp, she is making her case with five shutouts. With four consecutive starts, heading into this next camp, she is the first goalkeeper since Naeher to do that. But it will take dozens, if not a hundred games, and a World Cup trophy or two to make the list above. Solo earned 202 caps for her country, Scurry 175, Naeher 115. Hayes included Dickey, who turned 26 in early January, on a 26-player roster for a year-opening training camp being held from January 14-21 in Carson, Calif. The camp will conclude with matches against Paraguay on Jan. 24 at the Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, and Jan. 27 against Chile at Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara. Mandy McGlynn of the Utah Royals has four, while Jordan Silkowitz from Bay FC has yet to debut for the national team. Lee Horton, the long-time Charlotte Latin soccer coach who retired in 2022 with 1,012 girls' and boys' team wins, remembers when he recognized Dickey's talent. “She was in the eighth grade, and I was watching her play both soccer and basketball, just as a coach at the school, and she was ridiculous at both. God gifts some of us, and he gifted her to the brim. “I just loved to watch the girl play basketball. She loved having an assist better than scoring a basket. “So I pulled her aside in the middle of our campus one day, and said, ‘Claudia, you are going to play either big-time soccer or big-time basketball in college without a doubt, and I don't care which one it is, because you're so good at both. And he promised to support her in that effort. Along with Dickey, there was Ruthie Jones, who went on to an All-ACC, All-American career for Duke (2019-2023), and Paige Nurkin, who became the starting keeper at Columbia University (2020-23), with a graduate season (2024) at Wake Forest. Equally adept as a point guard, Dickey earned NCISAA All-State honors in both soccer and basketball. Horton was right about Dickey, but should have used a different conjunctive as Dickey played soccer and basketball for UNC her freshman year. On the pitch, she split time with former Carolina Ascent keeper Samantha Leshnak-Murphy, a senior, starting six of 16 games, earning a 6-2-1 record in goal. She also scored a penalty kick against UCLA in an NCAA quarterfinal shootout win. In her 4,187 minutes in the Carolina goal from 2018-21, she posted a remarkable .47 goals against average and 15 complete game shutouts. Before she could get her chance with the national team, though, Dickey had to establish herself at the club level, and she was one of several talented goalkeepers at Seattle, where she did what most rookies do their first year: She sat and watched when the whistle blew as Phallon Tullis-Joyce started all 29 matches across competitions. After three successful outings — all clean sheet wins — in the NWSL Challenge Cup, she finally started her first regular-season match on Aug. 27, 2023. It was a 2-1 away loss to Angel City. “Playing goalkeeper is a confidence thing,” she added. “And when you don't play games, I think it's really hard to go in because you want to prove yourself, or you want to be the one who makes a difference. But I think I've learned over the years, it's about being good and being steady, and not trying to go out and do the crazy things, or not trying to prove that you're good enough to be there. I think it's more important to be that backbone of the team, and be able to communicate with and rely on everybody in front of you, and when it gets to you, basically just doing your job. Harvey continued to start Dickey for the playoffs — if the wheel ain't broke, don't fix it — and Seattle won two 1-0 games to make the NWSL Final against Gotham FC. Dickey believes that getting the opportunity to play “was a mix of we were fighting for playoffs, and she wanted to maybe see me because I was also out of contract (after that season).” “It wasn't anything to do with (Tullis-Joyce), but (Seattle head coach) Laura (Harvey) started giving me — I started, the last six games of that season. Phallon was still there, and I think it was obviously like we were both probably good enough to be fighting for a spot.” The NWSL, in general, and most teams around the world, give great weight to veterans, especially when it comes to goalkeepers. Dickey doesn't believe Tullis-Joyce left to dodge a competition for the job. “I think it's fair to say her and Phallon have been given more of the minutes over this period of time. Phallon obviously cannot join this camp because she's a European-based player.” Hayes did not commit to a given starter but did say, “I feel very strongly about Claudia and Phallon at this moment in time,” adding, “There is a pool of players. They just need to keep developing a little bit more experience.” She also noted the move of Casey Murphy, the current active cap leader among goalkeepers with 20, from North Carolina Courage to Boston, saying, “Be curious to see how that invigorates her.” As a former academy director of the Charlotte Soccer Academy, he coached all of the Latin keepers and others in the region, so he's seen Dickey's rise to this opportunity and knows that she responds well to a competitive challenge. “There's been three predominant goalkeepers in the U.S. National Team tenure. So, Nicole Barnhart has 54 caps, but she sat behind Hope Solo for all of her career. With Naeher's retirement in 2024, Poole says, “There's no current, clear number one. I think the days of seeing one goalkeeper forever dominant with 200 caps might be over, but there's certainly a runway for her to become number one.” “Can she put together the mindset, mentality, all the things that we know are in her and confident are in her. Now that she's been in the net for the national team six times, Dickey hasn't given a thought to achieving legendary status. She knows it's far too early for that, and told the Observer that she really hadn't taken a moment to step back and appreciate the accomplishment. “My dream has always been to be on the national team. Not to take away from how special it is, but I think you have to believe in yourself so much that you don't let the arena, the game, the importance of it, get to you. Even when things go well, there's always something that can be better.” Get in-depth, sideline coverage of Charlotte area sports - only $1 a month</p>

The calendar has shifted to 2026, meaning the FIFA World Cup is now just around the corner.

The tournament will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada this summer, running from June 11 to July 19.

Mexico will have the honor of kicking off the World Cup on June 11 when it hosts South Africa at the Estadio Azteca. Canada and the United States will begin their World Cup journeys the following day.

This will be the first World Cup to feature 48 teams, a major expansion from the 32 nations that competed in the 2022 World Cup. The teams will be divided into 12 groups of four nations each.

The top two teams in each group – and the eight best third-place finishers – advance to knockout stage, which begins on June 28 with the Round of 32.

The round of 16 begins July 4, the quarterfinals on July 9 and semifinals take place July 14-15, leading up to the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey on July 19.

Former Manchester City, Roma and Inter striker Edin Dzeko has joined 2. Bundesliga leaders Schalke on a free transfer.

The 39-year-old has penned a short-term contract with the Gelsenkirchen club, to run until the end of the campaign, having left Fiorentina after just half a season.

It marks a return to German football for Dzeko, who made 142 appearances and scored 85 goals for Wolfsburg between 2007 and 2011.

Dzeko then joined Manchester City in January 2011, going on to score 72 goals in 189 outings for the club, winning two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and one EFL Cup.

He left for Roma – initially on loan – in 2015 and enjoyed his most prolific years in Italy, playing 260 times and scoring 119 times for the Giallorossi before switching to Inter, who he helped reach the Champions League final in 2023.

The Bosnia-Herzegovina icon, who is his country's all-time leading scorer with 72 goals in 146 caps, joins a side atop of German football's second tier, four points clear of Elversberg.

Schalke were Champions League semi-finalists as recently as 2011 but have been out of the Bundesliga since 2023, when they suffered their second relegation in three years. 

They almost dropped to the third tier last season, before turning things around under head coach Miron Muslic, who joined from Plymouth Argyle last May.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>VALENCIA, Spain (Jan. 15, 2026) – The U.S. Under-16 Girls' National Team shutout the Belgium U-17 Women's National Team in the third and final match of their January Camp in Spain. The U-16 GNT faced Germany twice before this match and saw improved results each match, coming away with a loss, a tie and a win today over the Belgians. The next two goals came in quick succession. In the 72nd minute, Asekomhe scored a goal of her own. She shot the ball from inside the box which Belgian goalkeeper Maud Deschutter saved but couldn't hold. Asekomhe wasted no time jumping on the rebound to put a first-time finish past the Deschutter. Having subbed on for Cabigon, Chinyadza picked up a loose ball on the top of the 18-yard box as Belgium was trying to build out. The U.S. didn't face much in the way of attack with Belgium mustering just five shots to the USA's 13, while U.S. goalkeepers Gabby Gjeldum and Olivia Hasan combined for two saves to keep Belgium off the board. All 20 players on this U.S. roster were born in 2010, which is the cutoff birth year to be eligible for the 2027 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, the tournament that this age group of players will be attempting to qualify for at the 2027 Concacaf Women's U-17 Championship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United youngsters Harry Amass and Toby Collyer are set to depart Old Trafford on loan for the remainder of the season, joining Norwich City and Hull City respectively. The duo, who previously faced scrutiny regarding their development paths during Ruben Amorim's tenure, will look to reignite their campaigns in the Championship after being recalled from previous spells earlier this month. The 22-year-old had been on loan at West Brom but saw his progress stalled by a groin injury and a lack of selection, a situation that drew public criticism from former United boss Amorim in December. Amorim, who was sacked earlier this month, had highlighted Collyer's struggles as an example of the difficulties United's academy graduates were facing in bridging the gap to senior football. “I'm always talking about the same thing, Toby [Collyer] and this injury is returning here,” Amorim said in December. Defending his use of young players in the first-team, he accused the academy products of being "entitled", saying: “We don't need to be always with accolades in everything in every situation, we are not helping. That's why when you guys talk about a lot of players nowadays that they go against the clubs and everything happened because they feel entitlement. I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United. The move to Hull City presents a completely different challenge and environment for Collyer. Hull currently sit fourth in the Championship table, just three points adrift of second-placed Ipswich Town. If Collyer can shake off the groin issue that has kept him out since November and break into the side, he could play a pivotal role in a Premier League promotion push. While Collyer struggled for minutes, 18-year-old left-back Amass enjoyed a far more productive, albeit strange, first half of the campaign. He made 21 appearances, scored one goal, and notably picked up two Player of the Month awards, showcasing the high ceiling that saw him make his senior United debut in March 2025. He is now set to join Norwich City, a club operating at the other end of the table from Collyer's new side. The Canaries are entrenched in a battle for survival but received a massive boost on Tuesday night with a five-goal victory over West Brom - Collyer's former loan club - which lifted them out of the relegation zone. Amass had attracted interest from several other Championship sides, but the opportunity to secure regular football at Carrow Road appears to have won out. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. These moves come at a critical juncture for United's player pathway management. Collyer, who made 13 appearances for the United first team last season under both Erik ten Hag and Amorim, is viewed as a player with significant pedigree. However, at 22, the need for weekly competitive football is paramount. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting For both players, the next six months are definitive. Collyer must prove his fitness and ability to influence games at the top end of the Championship, putting the memory of his stalled West Brom stint and Amorim's harsh words behind him. For Amass, the challenge is consistency; proving that his excellent form at Sheffield Wednesday was not a flash in the pan and that he can adapt quickly to a new club fighting for its life. With a new era dawning at Old Trafford following Amorim's exit, both players will be keenly aware that their performances in the Championship will be monitored closely by the incoming hierarchy.</p>

The Women's Super League sounded the alarm about the timing of the proposed FIFA Women's Club World Cup, warning of a potential "catastrophic" effect on English clubs and player workload.

Officials from England's top league wrote to FIFA to express deep concern about its plan to stage the inaugural global women's tournament from Jan. 5 to 30 in 2028, possibly in Qatar and smack in the middle ​of the English domestic schedule.

The event could force the postponement of fixtures across ‍five WSL ⁠match weeks and create a scheduling backlog. Other European leagues, including ‍the top leagues in France and Spain, run on similar schedules.
