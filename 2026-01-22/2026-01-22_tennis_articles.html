                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tested for the second straight round, Naomi Osaka raised her level late to outlast Sorana Cirstea in a three-set Australian Open second-round encounter. Clad once again in her aquamarine, jellyfish-inspired outfit, Naomi Osaka showed that it was the timing of her sting that mattered the most. For the second round in a row, she was taken to three sets. For the second match in a row, she elevated her level when she needed to, pulling away from Sorana Cirstea 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 in exactly two hours. Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play The matchup revived a piece of unfinished business from early in Osaka's career. Back in 2015, a 17-year-old Osaka made her Grand Slam qualifying debut at Wimbledon, only to be drawn against Cirstea -- then a former Top 30 player on the comeback trail from injury. Cirstea won that encounter 2-6, 6-1, 6-4 -- and then, remarkably, the pair did not meet again until this week. Cirstea, who has announced that 2026 will be her final season on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, put Osaka under pressure immediately as she took a 2-0 lead. But Osaka responded with a brilliant, high-intensity stretch of play to take six of the next seven games. Highlights included an angled backhand pass on the run to break Cirstea back early on, and a superb backhand volley at full stretch to save break point against her in the final game of the set -- one of a perfect seven out of seven points Osaka won at net. 41-ranked Cirstea hit back in the second set despite once again losing an early break lead. At 3-3, the 35-year-old saved a pair of break points against her and pounced as Osaka lapsed into error while serving to stay in the set. After an off-court medical timeout with Osaka leading 2-1, the match grew more tense, but the former World No. She struck 38 winners, including three aces, to Cirstea's 10 and saved five of eight break points. Tensions surfaced late in the third set. Serving at 4-2, 30-30, Cirstea objected to the umpire about Osaka's “c'mon” between first and second serves. Play resumed with Cirstea sending two forehands long, giving Osaka a double break. A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen) Asked what it had taken to get through the match in her on-court interview, Osaka responded: "Apparently a lot of c'mons that she was angry about," before raising her hands skyward. She's a great player; I think this was her last Australian Open, so ... sorry she was mad about it." Better vibes were to be found in the crowd, where two fans had wasted no time in creating their own versions of the butterfly-ornamented hat and veil that Osaka had worn for her Tuesday walk-on. The four-time major champion gave them a shoutout in her on-court interview. A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen) Later, both Osaka and Cirstea sought to downplay the incident in their respective press conferences. "I have been playing for 20 years," Cirstea said. "It's more than going on than a five-second discussion at the end that I had with Naomi. Again, I don't think that's the main thing after tonight's match. She was much better than me towards the end. "I guess that emotions were very high for her. Tested for the second straight round, Naomi Osaka raised her level late to outlast Sorana Cirstea in a three-set Australian Open second-round encounter.</p>

"Is this the big thing that happened tonight?" "For me this was my last match at the Australian Open, so I think I'll like to stay with that. 1 and two-time champion, Osaka has been one of the biggest stories of the tournament's first week—as much due to her on-court fashion as her play.

When host Steve Weissman asked Prakash Amritraj, Lindsey Davenport and Martina Navratilova on TC Live to pick a favorite, the panel was split.“Oh man… Favorite?

The second seed was relentless throughout, extending his flawless 9-0 record against Australian opponents at Grand Slam events. Sinner faced little trouble on serve, erasing all three break points he encountered, according to Infosys Stats. “Every match is very difficult, so I'm very happy to be in the next round,” Sinner said in his on-court interview. “I was returning very well today, and my serve was also good, so I'm very happy about my performance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not only did Iga Swiatek extend her perfect record against Marie Bouzkova with a 6-2, 6-3 victory on Thursday night, but she also improved to 24-0 in Grand Slam second rounds in the 2020s. Chief among them: extend her perfect record against Marie Bouzkova to 3-0, ideally in straight sets once again. That second part looked shaky when she fell behind by a break in the second set, but the No. 2 seed never truly appeared in danger of losing the match, closing out a 6-2, 6-3 win in 1 hour and 19 minutes. “It felt great playing today,” Swiatek said in her on-court interview. And for sure, the conditions also weren't easy. I don't know if you guys feel that, but on the court it's super windy. She has now reached the third round at 24 consecutive Grand Slam events; her last second-round exit came at the 2019 US Open, where she lost to Anastasija Sevastova. 2, who repeatedly used forward movement to take control of rallies. She incorporated this tactic immediately, creeping toward the net before firing a backhand winner by Bouzkova to hold for 1-0. She followed the same blueprint to guide her to a 4-1 hold, affording her a lead she would only build on before claiming the first set in 38 minutes. Fittingly, she ended the match with one final approach, this time finishing it with a forehand winner to seal the win. Tour's best frontrunner: That forehand was one of 31 winners Swiatek hit (compared to just three from Bouzkova), many coming after she built comfortable leads in each set. Because, if an opponent offers even a sliver of space, Swiatek tends to take far more. Swiatek burst through, converting her third break point of the game to level at 3-3. In all, she reeled off five straight games to finish the match, taking the lead and never looking back. A third win in a row would send her to the Australian Open fourth round for the sixth time and keep alive her bid to complete the career Grand Slam with a title in Melbourne. Not only did Iga Swiatek extend her perfect record against Marie Bouzkova with a 6-2, 6-3 victory on Thursday night, but she also improved to 24-0 in Grand Slam second rounds in the 2020s.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Corentin Moutet steps on a tennis court, you never know quite what to expect. He is a mercurial talent who will on Friday attempt to craft an upset against the No. Moutet has already shown glimpses of his showmanship this week at Melbourne Park. “I didn't think about it, [my opponent] was quite close to the baseline, and I still did it.” Underarm serves have in the past been known to cause strong reactions from some players and fans but Moutet, who used the shot six times in one match last June in Mallorca, is clear on his position that how and when the shot is used is key. “If you do it to provoke the crowd, that's different. I respect all my opponents, and I respect the crowd of course even when they are against me, because they bring a great energy and they are here to support someone. From my side, I never do it to disrespect anyone. So as long as it works, I am going to keep doing it… I think it saved me a few times. [Like] against Daniil [Medvedev] in Washington last year.” 37 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Moutet is bidding to back up a personal-best 2025 season in which he earned 33 tour-level wins, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. His Friday clash with Alcaraz will be the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. “I never practised with him and never played against him, so it will be a surprise, I think, even for him,” said Moutet, when asked about how his game style might clash with Alcaraz. “I'm trying not to overthink how it will be. “Let's see, but for sure it's going to be fun. He is very physical and talented as well, so it's going to be interesting. Let's see how I can deal with it.” You May Also Like: Alcaraz envies Federer's golf game: 'As beautiful as the tennis!' Moutet will be chasing his third victory against a Top 10 opponent when he steps on Rod Laver Arena to face Alcaraz. 1, who is bidding to complete the Career Grand Slam by lifting the Australian Open trophy, will likely be another step up. "One of the best, I think along with Jannik [Sinner]. I've really wanted to play against him because I want to see the highest level on the Tour. I'm working hard to reach this level, so it's always interesting to see what's going on there and how they play. So I'm curious and very happy to play against him.” Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic cruised to a convincing second-round victory Thursday at the Australian Open, where the record 10-time champion downed Francesco Maestrelli 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. “It did feel like two completely different tournaments playing at night [round one] and day today, particularly with the wind that I think has been blowing this year more than any other year that I've been playing here in Australia,” Djokovic said of the conditions. Rarely relinquishing control in baseline rallies, Djokovic will be pleased with his dominant serving display, having won 86 per cent (43/50) of his first-serve points. Djokovic is now one win shy of 400 victories at Slam level. Should he defeat his next opponent, Botic van de Zandschulp or Shang Juncheng, Djokovic will become the first player to record 400 major match wins. Van de Zandschulp stunned Djokovic last year at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Indian Wells, tying their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1. Making his 21st appearance at Melbourne Park, Djokovic is seeded to meet Italian Lorenzo Musetti in the quarter-finals and two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner in the last four. Musetti flew past countryman Lorenzo Sonego 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 to match his career-best result at the season's first major. The fifth seed created 23 break chances, converting six, according to Infosys Stats. Musetti, 23, will next meet 31st seed Stefanos Tsitsipas or Czech Tomas Machac.
