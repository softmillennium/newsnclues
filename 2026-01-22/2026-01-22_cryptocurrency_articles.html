                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this week, Coinbase announced the creation of an Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain, aiming to safeguard the crypto ecosystem against emerging quantum threats. Quantum computers, if scaled successfully, could compromise the cryptography that underpins major blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Coinbase, in their announcement, stressed that preparing for these future challenges is crucial to maintaining the security of digital assets. The advisory board includes notable figures such as quantum computing pioneer Scott Aaronson, Stanford cryptography expert Dan Boneh, Ethereum researcher Justin Drake, and Coinbase's own Head of Cryptography, Yehuda Lindell. The group says they will publish position papers, recommend best practices for long-term security, and respond to significant advances in quantum computing. This initiative is part of Coinbase's larger post-quantum security strategy, which also includes updating Bitcoin address handling, enhancing internal key management, and advancing research on post-quantum signature schemes. The board's first position paper is expected early next year, laying out a roadmap for quantum resilience in blockchain systems. Jefferies strategist Christopher Wood recently removed Bitcoin from his Greed & Fear model portfolio, citing the existential risk that large-scale quantum computers could undermine the cryptographic foundations securing digital assets. While the threat is not imminent, Wood and other institutional voices — including BlackRock and UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti — warn that quantum advances could eventually allow attackers to derive private keys from public ones, putting millions of BTC at risk. As a result, Wood replaced Bitcoin with gold and gold-mining equities, emphasizing that long-term store-of-value claims for digital assets may be less reliable in the face of accelerating technological change. Crypto developers and researchers are divided over the urgency of implementing quantum-resistant solutions, with some advocating proactive upgrades and others arguing the risk remains distant. Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor believes that quantum computing will actually strengthen Bitcoin rather than threaten it. Network upgrades and coin migrations will boost security, while lost coins remain frozen, Saylor posted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors pulled nearly $1 billion from exchange-traded funds tracking the spot price of Bitcoin and Ethereum on Wednesday, seeking refuge from cryptocurrency exposure as U.S. President Donald Trump struck a new chord in his approach to acquiring Greenland. Along those lines, Trump abruptly backed away from threats to impose tariffs on European nations that stood in opposition of his bid for the semi-autonomous island. Not long before, he also ruled out the use of force during his address in Davos, Switzerland. Markets rebounded following his comments after falling into the red Tuesday amid tariff uncertainty. On Thursday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen signaled that she was receptive to Trump's about-face, but she said in a statement that “we cannot negotiate our sovereignty,” pushing back against Trump's assertion that the U.S. must own the territory for national security. The developments had all the making of a “TACO” situation, short for “Trump Always Chickens Out.” The acronym was coined last year in reference to Trump's habit of announcing massive tariffs as a pressure tactic, only to reverse course once global markets begin to dip. However, the snapshot does not include flows from products listed in Europe. In a Thursday note, Jasper De Maere, a desk strategist at crypto market maker Wintermute, said Trump's pivot removed “some immediate geopolitical overhang that was driving the earlier selloff,” but “macro risk remains elevated” despite any stabilization in Bitcoin's price. Recently changing hands around $89,000, Bitcoin was down 7.5% over the past week, while Ethereum had fallen 12% to $2,950 over that same period of time, according to CoinGecko. Last week, they notched their highest prices in more than a month. “Bitcoin is acting like a high-beta and risk-on asset, trading very similarly to equities,” Carlos Guzman, a research analyst at crypto trading firm GSR, told Decrypt. CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill noted in a recent report that sentiment toward digital asset investment products soured last Friday, as diplomatic tensions flared. Ethereum Sentiment Flips Bearish as Traders Brace for Drop to $2.5K What's more, hopes regarding the passage of a crypto market structure bill have been dashed by Coinbase, which withdrew its support from the bill.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is where the “digital gold” nickname originated, as some believe that bitcoin can act as an apolitical base money for the digital age with a monetary policy that was “set in stone” when the network first launched all the way back in 2009. As Larry Fink, the CEO of financial titan BlackRock, explained just last month, “Bitcoin is an asset of fear . The long-term fundamental reason you own [bitcoin] is because of debasement.” While some view this digital gold narrative as a pivot from Bitcoin's original design, the reality is that the system's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was concerned with removing the trust required in central banks to not debase the currency in some of his earliest writings. This may all sound great in theory, but the reality is that bitcoin has routinely been unable to act like its analog sibling in times of global economic turmoil. For example, the bitcoin price suffered one of the worst crashes in its history when COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic in early March 2020. Last October, there was also a massive crash in the greater crypto market, including $16 billion in liquidations on leveraged positions, amid increased trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Of course, many of the liquidated positions were in crypto assets that are much more speculative and less credible than bitcoin. Meanwhile, gold is up roughly 5% over the past week. While bitcoin has seen increased institutional adoption from the likes of Ivy League university endowments, nation states, and the largest asset manager in the world, the reality is that central banks, most notably China, still prefer real gold over its digital alternative. That said, the functional utility of bitcoin as something like digital gold still exists, as was shown by the recent flight from crypto exchanges in Iran to the base Bitcoin network. In addition to the local populations, there has been extensive reporting on nation-states like Iran and Venezuela using crypto to avoid economic sanctions imposed by the United States. While much of this activity is being usurped by stablecoins, these dollar-pegged tokens can also be easily frozen by their centralized issuers. The fact that it still moves like a tech stock in times of increased economic tension is a sign that it is still early days for bitcoin, despite its market cap now being measured in the trillions of dollars. Crypto is now said to account for roughly 20% of the family's $6.8 billion fortune. Given that Bitcoin was created to circumvent traditional finance, what are we even doing here? She warned of "extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria, and a collapse in confidence." Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas have enacted laws aimed at creating their own reserves. Turns out people might like to circumvent centralized financial infrastructure in times of political upheaval.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To some, it might have seemed like a small technical upgrade that was long overdue. Yet, it came with outsized implications: China has just made its central bank digital currency the first in the world to offer returns to ordinary holders. As of the end of November 2025, the digital yuan has already processed over 3.48 billion transactions, totalling 16.7 trillion yuan ($2.38 trillion). By any measure, that is quite successful adoption. Their position has been clear for many years – that CBDCs must function like digital cash, with no interest, and no exceptions. An interest-bearing CBDC could potentially drain commercial bank deposits. The ECB's FAQ explicitly states that no interest would be paid on digital euro holdings. The Fed's 2022 discussion paper warned against exactly this scenario. But China saw the same risks and chose a different path, and a different future for the digital yuan. Starting from January 1, digital yuan wallet balances now function as liabilities of commercial banks under PBOC oversight – and they pay interest – marking the first time any CBDC worldwide operates in such a way. Most Western policymakers designed their frameworks assuming everyone would play by the same rules. They have built consensus around non-interest-bearing CBDCs to protect commercial banking, warned about disintermediation risk, and moved cautiously. China watched, learned, and then moved in a different direction. Originally, the digital yuan was supposed to replace paper money, making the digital currency easier to use (through mobile apps like Alipay) than its physical version. The new upgrade now sets it on a path to compete with bank accounts – with an expanded suite of use cases (payments, salaries, cross-border corridors). DC/EP followed every rule about central bank issuance and sovereign backing, but following the rules made it restrained. The People's Bank of China built DC/EP on the BIS Money Flower framework, analyzing every dimension: issuing entity, digitalization, account structure, public access. One conclusion stood out – only cash had not been properly digitized yet. Guoxin Securities' Wang Jian called it moving from "digital cash 1.0" to "deposit currency 2.0" – the point where digital yuan begins to have a potential crowding-out effect on existing forms of electronic currency. Moving to M1 means the digital yuan now functions like demand deposits, not just electronic cash, with interest accrued directly within wallets. The technical capability was always there, paved on M0 rails. Cross-border payments still mostly run on infrastructure designed decades ago – SWIFT messaging, correspondent banking chains, multi-day settlement windows. The system is slow, expensive, opaque, and increasingly tangled in geopolitical friction. Sanctions regimes, compliance requirements, and great-power competition have made the plumbing of international finance feel fragile in ways it did not ten years ago. China has been building different alternatives over the past decade. But mBridge requires participating countries to operate their own CBDC infrastructure – a high bar for economies that lack the technical capacity or institutional readiness. Cross-border trade is overwhelmingly B2B: businesses moving working capital across jurisdictions. When you talk to CFOs and treasury managers about what actually drives their decisions, three factors surface repeatedly: is my money safe? Digital yuan carries the full backing of the People's Bank of China – sovereign credit does not get more solid than that, and no commercial stablecoin can match it. Ease of use remains genuinely uncertain – integrating digital yuan into corporate treasury systems, accounting workflows, and banking relationships takes more than policy announcements. Working capital sitting in settlement queues now earns a return. For businesses running on thin margins – particularly SMEs in emerging markets where a few basis points on idle cash makes a real difference – the math shifts. Not dramatically, but enough to tip decisions at the margin – and the margin is often where adoption curves start to bend. For digital yuan to function internationally, it needs a jurisdiction that can translate between Chinese financial infrastructure and global standards. Hong Kong offers exactly that combination: a common law legal system familiar to international businesses, deep capital markets, established regulatory credibility, and proximity to the mainland that no other financial centre can replicate. Compliant stablecoins backed by offshore renminbi can serve as regulated on-ramps for international businesses – offering exposure to digital yuan settlement through a jurisdiction whose AML, CFT, and sanctions compliance frameworks they already understand. The LEAP framework still mandates full KYC requirements and real-time transaction monitoring, which means companies get the efficiency benefits of digital yuan rails without navigating an unfamiliar regulatory environment. Initial pilots concentrate in the Greater Bay Area and select RCEP countries – Thailand and Malaysia seem to appear frequently in planning documents. From there, expansion follows across Belt and Road economies – eventually, a parallel network emerges alongside mBridge, one that accommodates jurisdictions without their own CBDC infrastructure. Stablecoins achieved adoption by offering what CBDCs could not: flexibility, speed, and accessibility across borders with minimal friction. Most stablecoins designed to date work across a range of DeFi protocols, settle instantly onchain, and operate with lighter identity requirements than any government-backed system. That combination drove growth in ways official alternatives have not matched. But most stablecoins do not pay interest (notably the two biggest stablecoins by TVL – USDC and USDT) – and that gap is about to matter more now. Tether earned $10 billion last year from its treasury holdings, yet shared none of that with the people actually holding USDT – and Circle operates the same way. The value proposition has always been utility, not yield. Now with a sovereign-backed currency starting to offer return, even modest ones, the holding calculus is changing. It is not built on speculation or DeFi trading – those use cases care about different things. But for treasury management, working capital, and cross-border settlement, the contexts where safety and yield both matter, interest-bearing digital yuan is starting to look competitive. According to Fan Wenzhong, the Head of International Department at the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) in Beijing: "This 'public-private hybrid' framework offers a balanced path: it allows nations to benefit from the reach of global stablecoins while introducing a sovereign-backed 'stabilizer' – effectively insulating them from the systemic risks of a purely private stablecoin market”. But they will face pressure in segments where their zero-yield reality becomes a disadvantage against a central bank alternative that is equally safe and now returns something extra. With these news, it would be easy to frame this as China cracking a code that has stumped every other central bank. But the truth is messier – and much more interesting. Interest-bearing digital yuan addresses a real gap that was unsolved for many years, if not decades. It creates holding incentives that M0 positioning never could, it gives commercial banks reason to participate actively rather than comply reluctantly, and it opens pathways for cross-border applications that current infrastructure handles poorly. But success depends on factors that have not been tested under real conditions. Will businesses actually integrate digital yuan into treasury operations, or will it remain a policy priority that never quite translates into daily practice? Will trading partners trust Chinese financial infrastructure enough to route their own settlements through it? The harder question – the one every central bank is now watching China try to answer – is how you build a currency that people choose when they have alternatives. Mandates can force usage, but it is only genuine utility that creates preference. We are about to find out which approach works at scale – and the answers will shape how money moves for the next decades.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A joint pilot with Banque de France aims to tokenize France's commercial paper market, some “€300 billion… small enough to make sure that we can all learn the lessons and see how we can transpose this initiative in a broader sense.” Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong pushed the access narrative hard, arguing tokenization's “most powerful part… is just democratization of access to investment in high‑quality products,” noting an “unbrokered” world of “about 4 billion adults who don't have access or any ability to invest in high‑quality assets like the US stock market or real estate.” He cast crypto as the birth of “a new monetary system that I would call the Bitcoin standard instead of the gold standard… a return to sound money and something that is inflation resistant” as democracies struggle with deficits and fiat inflation. Villeroy de Galhau pushed back bluntly: “I am a bit skeptical… about this idea of the Bitcoin standard,” warning that “monetary policy and money is part of society” and that losing the public role would mean losing “a key function of democracy.” Money, he insisted, remains a “public‑private partnership,” with CBDC as anchor and “tokenized private money” strictly regulated or risk a “Gresham's law” dynamic where bad private money dominates transactions while CBDC is hoarded as store of value. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted just how far the first “poster child of tokenization” has already run: “stable coins… went from in 2024 $19 trillion of transactions… and 2025 is $33 trillion, so about 75% growth.” On Ripple's own XRP Ledger, he said, “tokenized assets… surged over 2,200% last year.” He argued the United States has shifted from being “pretty openly hostile” to crypto to electing a “much more pro‑crypto, pro‑innovation Congress,” with the industry pushing for “clarity… better than chaos” after Ripple's five‑year legal fight with Washington. Winters warned tokenization could mean “a full dollarization” for some emerging economies, even as it delivers “serious cost savings on the cross‑border business.” Villeroy de Galhau noted some G20 emerging powers have openly argued “we should forbid cryptos,” a path he rejects as sacrificing innovation but which underlines sovereignty fears. Asked whether blockchain tokenization can coexist with AI's voracious energy demand, Garlinghouse drew a sharp line between consensus models: “not all layer 1 blockchains are created equal,” stressing that proof‑of‑stake systems use “99.9% less energy than proof‑of‑work,” and that “most of the activity of stable coins today is on more power efficient blockchains” like post‑Merge Ethereum. Ether holds near the tokenization narrative it increasingly underpins: around $3,000 per ETH, with MetaMask listing $3,003.33 today, a 1.26% gain on the previous day's $2,965.92, while Bybit quotes $2,998.95 with a 24‑hour range between roughly $2,872 and $3,053. Tether's USDT, the largest stablecoin and de facto settlement rail for much of this ecosystem, trades almost perfectly on‑peg at about $0.9992, with a 24‑hour change of roughly +0.05%, a market capitalization near $186.9 billion, and reported daily volume just over $110 billion.

ENA, ASTER, and LIT are trading near the lower end of their respective ranges, and buyers may be attracted to the market's oversold region. Monero's (XMR) price has fallen below the moving average lines. XMR is trading above the 50-day SMA support but below the 21-day SMA resistance. Today, buyers are attempting to keep the price above the 21-day SMA level. In contrast, XMR will decline if the support is broken. XMR is currently the lowest-performing altcoin. The cryptocurrency price has dropped below its low of $0.20. ENA is declining as it nears the October 6 price level of $0.148. Doji candlesticks characterise the price action, causing the altcoin to trade within a range.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink used the World Economic Forum stage to argue that tokenization needs to move from pilot programs to market plumbing and suggested that a shared blockchain standard could cut costs and even “reduce corruption,” a framing that immediately reignited the “which chain?” debate across crypto and specifically inside the Ethereum community. But the combination of BlackRock's onchain product footprint and its own research positioning makes Ethereum the most natural candidate for the “one common blockchain” he alluded to, even if he kept it implicit. Fink's remarks, delivered in the language of infrastructure rather than crypto evangelism, leaned heavily on the operational case for digitized assets and interoperable settlement rails. “I think the movement towards tokenization, decimalization is necessary. It's ironic that we see two emerging countries leading the world in the tokenization and digitization of their currency, that's Brazil and India. He then pushed the argument beyond payments and into capital markets: “We would be reducing fees, we would do more democratization by reducing more fees if we had all investments on a tokenized platform that can move from a tokenized money market fund to equities and bonds and back and forth.” So I would argue that, yes, we have more dependencies on maybe one blockchain, which we could all talk about, but that being said, the activities are probably processed and more secure than ever before.” With one common blockchain, we can reduce corruption. In the abstract, “one common blockchain” could be read as a generic appeal for shared rails. On the ETF side, BlackRock's flagship US spot products track bitcoin and ether — iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) — with ETHA launching in 2024 and now sitting in the center of the firm's public-facing Ethereum exposure. While BUIDL has expanded across multiple networks over time, the key point for Fink's “common blockchain” framing is that Ethereum has been BlackRock's default starting point for public-chain issuance, a meaningful signal in a market where “standards” tend to follow whoever already has the deepest liquidity, the broadest integration surface, and the most conservative counterparties. The stronger tell came this week from BlackRock research rather than Davos soundbites. One slide asks: “Could Ethereum represent the ‘toll road' to tokenization?” and adds that stablecoin adoption may be an early proxy for tokenization “in action,” with “blockchains like Ethereum” positioned to benefit. In the same section, BlackRock cites RWA data “as of 1/5/2026” and notes that “of tokenized assets 65%+ are on Ethereum,” underscoring the network's lead in today's tokenized-asset stack.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Litecoin has always been crypto's steady hand. Fast, reliable, and rarely dramatic, LTC has earned its place as one of the market's longest-running payment coins. But lately, something subtle has been happening beneath the surface and long-time Litecoin holders have noticed it. And a growing portion of that capital is flowing into Remittix's ICO, where investors are chasing what they see as asymmetric upside rather than incremental gains. That shift says a lot about how the market is thinking heading into 2026. Litecoin does exactly what it's supposed to do. Litecoin's price action has become increasingly predictable. For whales managing large portfolios, that profile is useful, but it doesn't deliver the kind of growth that justifies heavy new allocations. In other words, Litecoin feels finished. Whales don't usually abandon assets they respect. With Remittix moving rapidly from presale to product launch, offering crypto-to-fiat payments at a global scale, it's becoming the kind of opportunity whales can't ignore. That's why Litecoin bags are getting lighter and why Remittix's ICO is starting to feel like a rotation worth paying attention to as 2026 approaches. That's exactly why Remittix is showing up in the same conversations. Remittix isn't trying to replace Litecoin, it's tackling a different layer of the payments stack. While Litecoin focuses on on-chain transfers, Remittix is building PayFi infrastructure that connects crypto directly to bank accounts worldwide. No crypto education required on the other end. That design dramatically expands the addressable market, especially for freelancers, SMEs and cross-border payments. For whales, this matters more than hype. The reason “7x” keeps coming up isn't magic; it's math. Litecoin's market cap is already large. To 7x from here would require massive, sustained inflows across the entire market. Remittix, by contrast, is still in its early phase. If adoption ramps as the PayFi platform goes live, price discovery happens fast, especially once liquidity, exchange listings and real transaction volume enter the picture. That's the kind of setup whales look for: It's about where new growth comes from. This isn't a referendum on Litecoin's relevance. It will likely continue to be used. But its role has shifted into the “reliable infrastructure” category, similar to how Bitcoin functions as a value anchor. Remittix sits in the growth infrastructure category, where usage, not just survival, drives valuation. If you're holding Litecoin, the takeaway isn't panic, it's perspective. As crypto adoption expands beyond traders into real payments, money movement and everyday finance, projects that connect crypto to fiat at scale are becoming the new focal point. They're betting that the next leg of growth comes from somewhere else. Not because Litecoin is failing, but because its upside is limited compared to early-stage utility projects with upcoming catalysts. Litecoin enables on-chain payments; Remittix connects crypto directly to global bank accounts through its PayFi platform. The full Remittix PayFi platform is scheduled to launch on February 9, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>X is preparing to launch “Starterpacks,” an onboarding feature for new users to help discover the best accounts and feeds based on interests like crypto and technology. Unveiled Thursday, X will roll out the feature in the coming weeks, Nikita Bier, Head of Product at X, noted. The curated starterpack in the crypto category will comprise memecoin trading with real-time market trends and sentiment from active traders. A short video posted by Bier showed the preview of how starterpacks work. It shows users selecting their interests while onboarding and following the curated list of accounts. Bier insisted that the issue is not tied to X's algorithms. On Wednesday, Bitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp wrote that there were 96 million posts on X containing ‘Bitcoin' in 2025, a 32% drop year-over-year. In a separate post on Wednesday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stressed the need for better mass communication tools. “We need mass communication tools that serve the user's long-term interest, not maximize short-term engagement,” he wrote on X. Further, he noted that crypto social projects has often been gone the wrong way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Going All-In on Decentralized Social Media as Farcaster, Lens Change Hands Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin said he's moving fully back to decentralized social media platforms in 2026, with his words coming right as the two biggest players in the space—Farcaster and Lens Protocol—have changed hands. In an X post, the outspoken founder highlighted the need for better mass communication tools, calling for a move beyond “everyone constantly tweeting inside a single global info warzone.” “We need mass communication tools that serve the user's long-term interest, not maximize short-term engagement,” said Buterin. But there is one important place to start: more competition.” “Decentralization is the way to enable that: a shared data layer, with anyone being able to build their own client on top,” he added. But after five years, it's clear Farcaster needs a new approach and leadership to reach its full potential.” That new approach will come less than two years after the platform raised $150 million in a Series A which valued the company at $1 billion and sought to expand its active user base and developer primitives. Farcaster's team recently said that it would pivot focus towards wallet development after the “social-first” approach failed to maintain momentum. While neither platform currently has a native token of its own, Buterin claims that most crypto social projects have inserted something speculative and considered it innovative. “Too often, we in crypto think that if you insert a speculative coin into something, that counts as ‘innovating,' and moves the world forward,” he posted. For the new leaders of Lens, that means a focus on “consumer-grade execution, product design, and global distribution.” For Farcaster, it is a new “builder-focused vision” that is expected to be shared soon. In both instances, the original teams will step away from day-to-day operations. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>
