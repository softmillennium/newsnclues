                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The non-coding genome, once dismissed as "junk DNA", is now recognized as a fundamental regulator of gene expression and a key player in understanding complex diseases. These regions, long overlooked due to their non-protein-coding nature, are now known to harbor regulatory elements crucial for cell function and disease progression. Integrative approaches, combining genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, have revealed that non-coding regions are not mere bystanders but actively participate in controlling gene expression through a network of enhancers, promoters, and chromatin modifications. High-throughput techniques such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq have enabled the identification of transcription factor binding sites, open chromatin regions, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts. Furthermore, methods like chromosome conformation capture (3C) and Hi-C have provided insights into chromatin architecture, highlighting the spatial relationships between enhancers and promoters. A key breakthrough lies in understanding how non-coding variants contribute to disease. Studies have demonstrated that mutations within enhancer regions, promoter sequences, and regulatory RNAs can disrupt gene expression, leading to various genetic disorders and cancers. For instance, mutations in enhancer elements of the SNCA gene are linked to Parkinson's disease, while alterations in the TERT promoter are associated with cancer progression. These findings underscore the importance of non-coding DNA in maintaining genomic stability and preventing pathological transformations. The transition from seeing non-coding DNA as biological noise to recognizing its regulatory significance marks a paradigm shift in genomic medicine. By targeting non-coding elements implicated in disease etiology, it may be possible to develop tailored therapies that address the root causes of gene dysregulation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prostate cancer remains a global health challenge, ranking as the second most common malignancy among men. While early-stage disease can be effectively managed, advanced forms-particularly metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)-pose significant therapeutic hurdles. A growing body of evidence highlights the pivotal role of SOX transcription factors, with SOX2 emerging as a central driver in tumor growth, spread, and resistance to therapy. SOX2 is intricately linked to the fate of cancer stem/progenitor cells, influencing processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which fuel invasion and metastasis. This adaptability often facilitates transformation into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), an aggressive variant with limited treatment options. At the molecular level, SOX2 operates within a complex regulatory network, interacting with key transcription factors, non-coding RNAs, and epigenetic modifications. It is also a critical node in multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, Hedgehog, Wnt/Î²-catenin, and TGF-Î², which collectively sustain cancer stem cell traits and drive disease progression. It supports resistance to chemotherapy by inducing a reversible quiescent state and activating survival pathways, while also mediating resistance to nuclear hormone receptor signaling inhibitors through modulation of cell cycle regulators and glucocorticoid receptor expression. The potential of targeting SOX2-directly or indirectly-offers a promising avenue for innovation. Strategies may include disrupting its protein-protein interactions, modulating upstream regulators or downstream pathways, and harnessing small-molecule inhibitors to selectively curb its tumor-promoting functions. However, given SOX2's importance in normal tissue regeneration, therapeutic approaches must balance efficacy with safety to minimize adverse effects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The identification of Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) as a crucial biomarker in liver disease is revolutionizing how clinicians approach the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of various liver conditions. As a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 18, CHI3L1 is recognized for its unique ability to bind to ligands and influence multiple pathophysiological processes, despite lacking enzymatic activity. This distinctive protein plays a key role in mediating cell proliferation, inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical to managing these conditions effectively, but traditional methods such as liver biopsy are invasive and not ideal for frequent monitoring. Elevated levels of CHI3L1 correlate with fibrosis severity, particularly in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and chronic hepatitis C (CHC), where it demonstrates superior diagnostic efficacy compared to conventional markers like hyaluronic acid (HA) and FIB-4. Furthermore, CHI3L1 has shown promise in distinguishing between simple steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is vital for identifying patients at higher risk of progressing to cirrhosis or HCC. Combining CHI3L1 with other markers, such as alpha-fetal protein (AFP) and platelet count, enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in detecting significant fibrosis and advanced stages of liver disease. Studies indicate that elevated CHI3L1 levels correlate with poor survival rates, especially after curative resection. When combined with AFP, CHI3L1 significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy for HCC, offering clinicians a more reliable method for early detection and risk assessment. The integration of CHI3L1 measurements with routine clinical practice could transform patient management by enabling more precise risk stratification and tailored therapies. The growing body of evidence supports the use of CHI3L1 not only as a biomarker for liver fibrosis but also as a potential therapeutic target. As a key regulator of fibrosis and inflammation, targeting CHI3L1 could mitigate disease progression and improve outcomes for patients suffering from chronic liver diseases. Further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying CHI3L1's actions will enhance our understanding of liver pathology and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Air pollution from oil and gas is causing 91,000 premature deaths and hundreds of thousands of health issues across the United States annually, with Black, Asian, Native American and Hispanic groups consistently the most affected, finds a major new study led by researchers at UCL and the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI). In addition, the researchers found that 10,350 pre-term births and 216,000 new cases of childhood asthma per year were attributable to oil and gas air pollution, as well as 1,610 lifetime cancers across the US. They then used this information, along with established health risk data, to estimate the number of severe health outcomes like asthma, preterm birth, and early death. This enabled us to work out and compare health outcomes. What we found was striking: one in five preterm births and adult deaths linked to fine particulate pollution are from oil and gas. Even more concerning is that nearly 90% of new childhood asthma cases tied to nitrogen dioxide pollution were from this sector." Dr. Karn Vohra, Lead Author, UCL Geography, now at University of Birmingham When normalised for population, residents in New Jersey, the District of Columbia, New York, California, and Maryland are subject to the greatest health impacts. Across the US, marginalised ethnic and racial groups face the greatest exposure to air pollution and health impacts across all stages. On a national scale, downstream activities cause far less pollution than upstream and end-use activities, but this stage is the cause for greatest relative adverse health outcomes for the Black population, particularly in Southern Louisiana (the region known as "Cancer Alley") and eastern Texas. The health outcomes for the Black population that are more severe than national incidences include premature mortality, preterm births, and development of asthma amongst children. Much of the disparity in exposures and health outcomes stem from a legacy of zoning practices, such as "redlining," that relegated certain populations to live near pollution hotspots such as industrial areas or high-traffic roadways. Permitting of large factories that produce products from oil and gas is another contributing factor. Senior author, Professor Eloise Marais (UCL Geography), said: "It is well known that air pollution from oil and gas activities causes certain communities to experience worse health outcomes. These communities are already aware of this unjust exposure and the disproportionately large health burdens they experience. Our study puts science-backed numbers on just how large these unfair exposures and health outcomes are." The researchers were also able to track air pollution across borders, attributing 1,170 early deaths in southern Canada and 440 early deaths in northern Mexico to oil and gas air pollution from the US. Co-author Dr Ploy Achakulwisut (SEI) said: "Our study provides yet another compelling case for why we need to accelerate the phase-out of oil and gas production and combustion with hard numbers: hundreds of thousands of children, adults, and the elderly in the US could be saved from illnesses and early deaths every year. The researchers developed a comprehensive inventory of oil and gas air pollution sources, then ran it through a computer model that calculates the complex air chemistry that forms harmful pollutants across the US. They then used these air pollutant concentrations with epidemiological evidence of the relationship between exposure and health risk along with census and health data to determine multiple adverse health outcomes and racial-ethnic disparities. This analysis was carried out by researchers from UCL, the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), George Washington University and University of Colorado Boulder.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Working-age adults with disabilities experience far higher rates of loneliness than those without, according to a new study from researchers at the Brown University School of Public Health and the Warren Alpert Medical School. The work shines a spotlight on a significant but often overlooked public health concern regarding people with disabilities and the structural barriers that often limit their full participation in work, community and daily life. Loneliness is known to be a risk factor for morbidity and mortality, but there is sparse research about loneliness among people with disabilities, especially in the age group of adults younger than 65. Our study calls attention to the need for further research focused on working-age adults with disabilities, both to characterize the factors driving their exceptionally high loneliness burden and to mitigate downstream health consequences." These rates are much higher than among people without disabilities, Clark and co-author Maggie Salinger, an assistant professor of medicine, point out. In a nationally representative survey of more than 20,000 U.S. adults, for instance, just 8% of adults reported often feeling left out or isolated and only 10% said they often felt alone. "We think people with disabilities may be predisposed to loneliness, since disability is a byproduct of social and structural barriers that restrict people's access to full societal participation," Salinger said. "We are worried that a disproportionately high degree of loneliness could compound the array of health disparities already known to affect people with disabilities, which is why we set out to quantify their burden of loneliness and study it more closely." The Brown team's findings also point to solutions, showing why addressing loneliness must be part of broader efforts to improve health equity for people with disabilities. "The loneliness crisis is already on public health officials' radars," Clark said. "This study shows them how important it is to design loneliness interventions that are both accessible and tailored to people with varied disability types."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a preclinical study, researchers found tamoxifen encourages uterine cell growth; the findings could change how some breast cancers are treated in the future. Studies show that people receiving tamoxifen, a highly effective and commonly used therapy to treat breast cancer, face a 2- to 7-fold increased risk of developing uterine cancer within 2-5 years of tamoxifen treatment compared to the general population. A new study led by researchers at Mass General Brigham, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) at CharitÃ© sheds light on the mechanism underlying this link and how blocking a specific molecular pathway may offer a way to prevent uterine cancers from occurring in patients taking tamoxifen. "Our findings suggest that tamoxifen activates a cell growth signaling pathway in cells in the uterus," said co-corresponding author Gad Getz, PhD, Director of Bioinformatics at the Mass General Cancer Center, part of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system and an Institute Member at Broad. "Importantly, they also point to a potential way to intervene to prevent patients with breast cancer from developing a second, serious cancer in the future," said co-corresponding author Kirsten KÃ¼bler, MD, PhD, formerly a research fellow in Medicine at Mass General Brigham, currently an Associated Scientist at the Broad Institute and a professor at the BIH. Researchers performed whole-exome sequencing of 21 uterine cancers that were associated with previous tamoxifen use, and compared their genetic makeup with those of non-tamoxifen-associated uterine cancers in published databases. Results, published in Nature Genetics, found only 14% of post-tamoxifen uterine cancers harbored cancer-related PIK3CA mutations, compared to 48% of uterine cancers diagnosed in women who hadn't taken tamoxifen. To see how tamoxifen might induce cancer without inducing genetic changes, the researchers exposed mice to estrogen, tamoxifen, or no treatment. Researchers then exposed mice to both tamoxifen and alpelisib, a drug that blocks the P13K pathway and is also used in the treatment of breast cancer. The addition of alpelisib significantly decreased PI3K-AKT signaling, IGF1 receptor activation, and cell proliferation. Future clinical research can confirm whether combining non-mutant selective PI3K inhibitors with tamoxifen reduces the risk of uterine cancer and ultimately saves lives."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine and collaborating Japanese institutions found that patients carrying colibactin-producing Escherichia coli (pks+ E. coli) in their colon polyps were more than three times as likely to have a history of colorectal cancer compared to those without the bacterium. Between 2018 and 2019, the team studied 75 FAP patients who had not yet undergone colon surgery, preserving their natural gut microbiota. This study raises the possibility that targeting specific microbes could help prevent cancer in high-risk groups." The researchers propose that colibactin, a toxin produced by the bacterium, damages DNA and triggers inflammatory signals that may accelerate tumor progression in the already vulnerable colonic tissue of FAP patients. Larger, multicenter studies are needed to confirm the results. The study provides early but compelling evidence that colibactin-producing E. coli may play a role in colorectal cancer development in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. By shining light on the interplay between genes, microbes, and environment, the findings open new avenues for cancer prevention strategies in hereditary syndromes.
