                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As James Gunn brings Peacemaker into his new DCU with Season 2, he's clearing up some canonical confusion for fans. Following this week's season premiere ‘The Ties That Grind', the DC Studios boss explained that he doesn't plan to retcon Season 1, despite subbing in Isabela Merced‘s Hawkgirl and Nathan Fillion‘s Green Lantern for two DCEU characters featured in the first season finale. “No, unfortunately I'd have to change too many little things throughout Season 1, and it would cost too much money,” he told TV Insider. “And I'd rather just give that money to a few more CGI shots of superheroes. “But I think that we deal with it. We say, canon is really Creature Commandos, Superman, Peacemaker Season 2. Obviously, we're changing that one thing, but we're not gonna go back and reshoot all of it for Season 1, at least not at this point.” The Season 1 finale of Peacemaker features John Cena‘s titular vigilante and his team walking away from an extraterrestrial battle as the silhouettes of DCEU's Justice League arrived, including Superman (Henry Cavill), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and The Flash (Ezra Miller). Merced and Fillion appear in another scene, alongside Justice Gang sponsor Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn), as Peacemaker auditions for the group of heroes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We are not going to stop coming after him,” a senior Trump administration official tells Rolling Stone. “If this criminal wanted amnesty, he should have prayed for Kamala to win. As Abrego Garcia and his family have racked up victories, big and small, against Trump in court, the administration has lashed out with increasing intensity. Multiple sources familiar with the matter say that several top Trump officials, including White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, believe that if Abrego Garcia and his legal team were to score a sustainable legal victory, it would be a significant blow to the Trump administration's immigration agenda — and therefore Abrego Garcia cannot be allowed to win. In March, Trump unlawfully sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, where the Maryland father says he was tortured, in defiance of a court order barring his deportation there. For two months, the administration disregarded a Supreme Court order demanding his return, before suddenly bringing him back to the U.S. to face new alien smuggling charges in Tennessee. With that Tennessee case faltering, Trump officials apparently gave Abrego Garcia a disturbing choice. Beat Trump in court again, and Trump would pull the rug out from under him and send him to Uganda, a country the State Department says Americans should reconsider traveling to due to threats of terrorism and violent crime. “We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country,” Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a statement on Friday. “Heightening the constitutional concern, the government has engaged in these tactics through two agencies — DOJ and DHS — that it has previously represented were ‘separate agenc[ies] with separate leadership [and] separate direction' that could not control one another,” the lawyers wrote. “But these two agencies are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world. ICE Is Constantly Using Coast Guard Planes to Move Immigrants Ghislaine Maxwell Told Trump's DOJ She's ‘Always Liked' and ‘Admires' Him The Trump administration, in what it's claimed was an “administrative error,” wrongfully deported Abrego Garcia to prison in El Salvador for three months, where he was severely beaten and psychologically tortured, according to his lawyers. The Maryland resident and father of three came from El Salvador to the U.S. in 2011, and in 2019 he was given protection from deportation because he would face gang violence. While the Tennessee court previously ordered Abrego Garcia's release on bail, he remained in jail for some time because his attorneys worried that the Trump administration would try to deport him again, this time to a third-party country, if he was freed. An immigration official said in July that officials might send him to Mexico or South Sudan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That also means DeVito has been making the interview rounds, including revealing a recent prank war he got into with his fellow cast members—one that saw him briefly threaten to call his lawyer, before proceeding to do his best to give as good as he got. Talking to THR, DeVito was asked if he's ever balked at anything that the show's creators have asked him to do—a gamut of indignities that starts with “emerging, greased up and naked, from a couch-womb,” and just kind of expands out from there—and says there was only one. Reiterating a story he also told in the run-up to the season, DeVito says that, one fine April morning, he was preparing to film the first episode of one of the show's seasons, only to be told that series creators Rob Mac, Charlie Day, and Glenn Howerton had decided to change directions and send over a new script for him. Said new script contained much of the typical It's Always Sunny bar-based shenanigans—except for the Frank plotline, which involved DeVito's character being arrested, beaten, and repeatedly sexually assaulted while in prison. Which is, y'know, pretty dark, even for Sunny. '” He said he was on the verge of calling his lawyer when he got to the script's final page, which ends with one of the abusive cops in question threatening one more assault, before whispering “April Fools, motherfucker” in Frank's ear—at which point, DeVito realized he'd been handed the new script on April 1. According to DeVito (who has some past prank experience), he did at least get his co-workers back, albeit in a way that sounds a little less bleak than “We're going to make you pretend to be raped and beaten on national TV.” DeVito recounts to THR that, at the show's next appearance at FX's Upfronts, he “got there early, and we all had rooms that FX had given us on our own, so I talked to the manager, and I said, ‘Look, don't give them their rooms. Give me a small room with one bedroom and get me a bunch of cots and tell them that the place is filled.' They were all in the room, and I was in a closet with a bottle of tequila and glasses watching them react to the fact that this guy is telling them there's no room in this hotel and this is the room that FX booked for them and they all had to sleep together on cots.” In a moment we really wish had been filmed, Rob Mac was apparently about to get on his phone to complain to the “big shots” about the treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter THR calls balls and strikes on the actors who deserve an MVP award for their athletic prowess onscreen — and those who needed a little more time in the minors. But with a handful of exceptions, actors in sports movies and series don't always have athletic backgrounds, at least not at the level of the characters they're portraying. Rigorous training ahead of the cameras rolling can help, as can editing and other tricks of the trade, but not everyone can pull off the level of athleticism needed for audiences to fully suspend their disbelief. Here are some of the best, and a few of the worst, athletic performances in movies and TV. (Costner's golf game in Tin Cup is also pretty solid.) The stars of Luca Guadagnino's movie Challengers, about a love triangle set in the professional tennis world, trained on the court for a good while before filming — but behind-the-scenes clips and other breakdowns of the movie make it clear they weren't actually hitting a ball in many of the tennis scenes. The composition and editing of the Creed films' fight scenes do a great job of putting viewers within the action, but all of that wouldn't work nearly as well if Jordan (who also played a talented high school quarterback on NBC's Friday Night Lights) didn't showcase fast hands and good form in the ring. Oliver Stone's gonzo football movie Any Given Sunday is maybe not the most realistic depiction of the sport ever put on film. But as benchwarmer turned starter Willie Beamen, Foxx — a high school quarterback in his home state of Texas — does his best to ground the frenetic action with a smooth throwing motion and some real athleticism. Swank won an Oscar for playing an up-and-coming boxer who meets a tragic end in the ring in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby. There's no arguing with the (onscreen) results of Happy Gilmore's unorthodox approach to hitting a golf ball, taken from the character's days as a hockey player. But there's a reason no one on the professional tours swings like that. Most of the actors playing footballers in Ted Lasso had been on a pitch before, and while no one would ever mistake the in-game action on the show for a real Premier League match, the cast held its own. Although both are less than 6 feet tall, Snipes and Harrelson showed some real basketball skill as playground hoops hustlers in Ron Shelton's 1992 cult favorite White Men Can't Jump. Maybe not enough to actually get the better of former UCLA great and NBA All-Star Marques Johnson (who played the hotheaded Raymond in a memorable scene), but more than enough to sell the movie's conceit. The boorish (but hilarious) Al Czervik is supposed to be terrible at golf, so by that standard, Dangerfield nails his Caddyshack performance. Even to an untrained eye, Al's swing is atrocious. The Bad News Bears and Bull Durham are among the best baseball movies, but not necessarily because of how well they depicted on-field play. These two actors played minor league pitchers (or ex-pitcher, in the case of Matthau's Morris Buttermaker) who somehow got near the cusp of the big leagues despite obviously terrible mechanics. Robbins' Nuke LaLoosh in Bull Durham had a “million-dollar arm but a five-cent head,” and his delivery wasn't much better than the latter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kit Connor is preparing Heartstopper fans for an ending that's sure to have a few hearts racing. “So I was doing rugby training today, hence all the mud and lovely stuff—my favorite thing to do,” Connor told fellow actor Louis Partridge in a conversation for VMan, to which the Enola Holmes actor quipped: “If it isn't rugby training, it's SEAL training. Connor added, “Always some kind of throwing myself on the ground. We shot quite a steamy scene yesterday. So again, throwing myself on the ground in a different way.” Before Netflix announced the feature film finale in April, Oseman previously told Deadline she was hoping for a renewal, with the sixth and final installment of her graphic novel series in the works. “I think one more season or one more, whatever it could be, would finish the story, conclude everyone's character arcs, and help us to say goodbye to all of those characters,” said Oseman in October. Heartstopper stars Connor and Joe Locke as Nick Nelson and Charlie Spring, two English schoolboys who spark a romance amid their unlikely friendship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weeks after learning their HGTV show “Married to Real Estate” had not been renewed for a fourth season, Egypt Sherrod and Mike Jackson were stunned when the series was nominated for a 2025 Emmy Award. When a follower asked in the comments, “Would you even go if you were asked back 🤔,” Sherrod gave a blunt six-word response: “No, we would not. Fed up with hearing false reports about their marriage and their show's future, Jackson posted a video on August 21 to clear up the rumors, and Sherrod walked into the room to join him. “There have been articles and rumors going around that we've been asked or invited back to HGTV,” Jackson said and Sherrod shook her head, adding, “Oh. “We happened to be scrolling,” Sherrod said, telling followers that they'd recently seen nine online articles that claimed to have interviewed the couple, with fake quotes from them about going back to HGTV. Sherrod appeared nervous about her husband saying any more, and reiterated, “We are filming. And we will tell you first where our ‘next' is. But it is not going to come from any of those articles, and we are not going backwards — only forward.” One month after the finale of Sherrod and Jackson's fourth season of “Married to Real Estate,” the couple was surprised to learn their show wouldn't be returning. In a statement Sherrod issued via social media on June 24, 2025, she posted in black text on a white background, “Mike and I just landed back in the States after an unforgettable family trip through the Mediterranean, and we're met with unexpected news: HGTV has decided not to move forward with Married to Real Estate.” “While the chain of events leading up to this is disheartening,” she continued, “we are deeply grateful. Grateful for our amazing crew and supportive fans. The Atlanta-based couple and their daughters decided to clear their heads with an impromptu Florida beach getaway, posting pics and even meeting up with “100 Day Dream Home” stars Brian and Mika Kleinschmidt. Upon returning home, the duo learned “Married to Real Estate” had been nominated for a 2025 daytime Emmy Award, an honor neither of them could believe. In the last paragraph of an August 14 post by Sherrod, she wrote, “There's more to say, and we'll share soon. But for now, know this: not all setbacks are what they seem.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During their discussion, one of the most fascinating exchanges was between Clarkson and former “The Voice” coach Nick Jonas about their little-known song with comedian Steve Martin, for which they're both credited as writers. I didn't even think about that till (now),” Clarkson marveled about the tune, “I Hate Love,” which appeared on her 2023 album “Chemistry.” After Clarkson noted that a “split” is when other artists become involved in the songwriting process and need to be credited as a co-writer, Jonas continued, “And I'm like, ‘I'm sorry, what are you talking about?' And they're like, ‘Oh, I guess you wrote a song with her. “A producer that we both worked with had opened up a guitar track or something that I had started,” Jonas continued. Clarkson's new four-part series, which she executive produced, was filmed before the death of her ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, which caused her to cancel her Las Vegas residency and miss taping an episode of “The Voice” season 29. According to NBC's logline for the show, it will give viewers “a front-row pass for Kelly Clarkson to engage with some of her favorite celebrities and examine both their music and personal lives. The specials are a forum where iconic voices meet heartfelt storytelling through unfiltered conversation and sung in an intimate, unplugged setting.” Fellow executive producer Alex Duda, who also oversees Clarkson's talk show, told TV Insider that the new series “allows Kelly to do what she does best — dive deep into the music and combine her musical expertise with her genuine curiosity.” Clarkson's future guests are Gloria Estefan, Lizzo, and Teddy Swims, with each hour-long episode airing on Tuesday nights at 10 p.m. Eastern time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diego Borella, an assistant director on the upcoming fifth season of Emily in Paris, has died after collapsing on the set of the Netflix show in Venice, Italy. Filming was temporarily suspended after the Italian crew member of the Paramount Television Studios production was pronounced dead at around 7pm on Thursday after he collapsed during preparation for a final scene being shot at Hotel Danieli, according to multiple local outlets. “We are deeply saddened to confirm the sudden passing of a member of the Emily in Paris production family,” a Paramount Television Studios spokesperson said in a statement. “Our hearts go out to the individual's family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.” The show's medical staff attempted to treat Borella, but he died at the scene, likely of “a sudden heart attack,” according to La Repubblica. Season 5 of the comedy, greenlighted last September, started filming in Rome in May before returning to Paris, with a few days in Venice scheduled at the tail-end of production. “I think we've got a really terrific season coming up,” said Star last month. “We filmed in Rome for the first four weeks, and that was an exciting experience to be there. Season 5 of Emily In Paris is set to premiere Dec. 18 on Netflix. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. And they continued shooting two days after like nothing happened???

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus, the Latin Recording Academy announces this year's Leading Ladies of Entertainment honorees. From career milestones to new music releases to major announcements and those little important moments, Billboard editors highlight uplifting moments in Latin music. Here's what happened in the Latin music world this week. Argentine singer-songwriter Maria Becerra has made acting debut on Netflix's new series En El Barro, the spin-off of the series El Marginal, produced by Netflix and Underground, a division of Telemundo Studios. Becerra, who also performs the series official song, “7 Vidas,” steps into the role of Cleo, “a young woman from the neighborhood who falls in love and faces motherhood while struggling to keep her child close in the midst of extreme circumstances,” according to an official description of her character. The Latin Recording Academy announced on Tuesday (Aug. 19) its 2025 Leading Ladies of Entertainment honorees. The women will be celebrated during Latin Grammy Week in Las Vegas, with Amazon Music joining as presenting sponsor for the second consecutive year. “Our past honorees have helped grow our Mentorship Program, and we look forward to having this year's class continue that legacy and empower future generations of young women.” “Her fearless artistry, record-breaking tours and unwavering advocacy embody the spirit of this recognition,” Antonio Tijerino, Hispanic Heritage Foundation president/CEO, said  in a statement. Rauw Alejandro was previously announced as the 2025 Hispanic Heritage Award honoree for Vision. Latin Music Week will feature panels, live performances, workshops, and networking events, wrapping up with a special celebration concert on Oct. 24.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cindy Crawford is soaking up the last days of summer, showing off her radiant, makeup-free look in a new Instagram post. The carousel of photos featured Crawford embracing a fresh, makeup-free look. In the first photo, Crawford can be seen with her husband, Rande Gerber, 63. The couple is smiling alongside each other while on a boat. She can also be seen sporting her summer tan during the casual outing. She accessorized it with black sunglasses and a trucker hat. In the second photo, Crawford kept things even more laid-back. She can be seen wearing cozy sleepwear, pairing it with a loose gray long-sleeve tee with white pajama shorts, and fur-lined brown loafers. Crawford can be seen holding a striped coffee mug while showing off her striking side profile. The Instagram post also included an image of Crawford spending some time with her friends, Stephanie Coffey and actress and Bleusalt founder, Lyndie Benson. It was time spent by the water for the girls' catch-up day, as Crawford looked amazing while sporting a tie-dye cover-up and oversized straw hat. Crawford captioned the photos, saying, “And that's a wrap on summer ‘25 ❤️🌅🌊.” Crawford's daughter, Kaia Gerber, wrote the sweetest comment on her mom's post. Crawford's fresh-faced look in the photos shouldn't surprise anyone. Crawford added, “I would say that's the biggest evolution for me, which is kind of counterintuitive, but that also means that taking care of your skin is more important because you're not covering it up with makeup.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week in Staff Picks, Matt Schimkowitz hails Steve Coogan's latest turn as a certain boorish broadcaster and Danette Chavez stumps for a Tubi (by way of AMC) original. Alan Partridge, Steve Coogan's long-running alter ego, has rarely been so active. There's more on the horizon, with a new BBC series, How Are You, arriving imminently. Ostensibly set from his home, which he calls the Oast house, even though he won't be drying any hops there, Oasthouse is an attempt at recreating idyllic British life from the perspective of a put-upon conservative broadcaster of a certain age. Whether he's adding live commentary to King Charles' coronation, driving his assistant Lynn Benfield (dutifully played, once again, by Felicity Montagu) to the doctor, or on stakeout in an attempt to catch a neighbor illegally dumping building materials on his cul-de-sac, Coogan finds original avenues into the character's narcissistic Anglophilia. It creates more of an audio drama, akin to a radio show, with crisp, reactive sound effects that allow Coogan and co. to mine as much specificity out of a situation as possible. The result is a podcast that rewards close listening and ASMR sensitivities. Coogan's character is a broadcast chameleon, able to take the form of whatever medium he's placed in. One of Alan's artistically refined achievements was Mid Morning Matters, the high-concept sponcon-turned-webseries filmed from a webcam fixed to his radio mixing board. He needs room to banter, whether another person is present or not. (Though his ad-reads are also tremendously funny, allowing him to show off his unrivaled enunciation and mastery of sibilants—Hear: Alan's ad read for Ship-Shape Fish Shop: “where fish makes a splash.”) Oasthouse follows in the faux-radio show tradition by forcing Alan into a box and making it his own. A graphic designer (Okieriete Onaodowan as the eponymous protagonist) sets aside the 33rd year of his life for “martyrdom,” and things just get stranger and more poignant from there in Demascus, a stylish and prickly new sci-fi series from playwright Tearrance Arvelle Chisholm. When he slips on the sleek headset (take note, Oculus designers), he's able to visit alternate realities, “but only as a voyeur.” He's not to interfere or linger in his alternate lives, no matter how dangerous or titillating they may be—doing so “may permanently corrupt [his] primary reality.” Though only six episodes, season one covers a lot of territory, occasionally with the use of self-driving cars that actually work (and even project a photorealistic image that would make the Driving Crooner weep). Chisholm uses his theater background to powerful effect in the more intimate moments, like when a couples' night goes off the rails or Demascus' therapist Dr. Bonnetville (Janet Hubert, at once cool and maternal) urges him not to back away from his journey of self-discovery. Will Demascus come to realize he's actually a voyeur in his primary reality too? The series grows headier as it goes on, but even if Demascus starts to lose sight of who he is (or isn't), Chisholm and his fellow writers Lauren Glover and Kirk A. Moore maintain a firm grasp on their multiversal storytelling. A great supporting cast, including Hubert, Caleb Eberhardt, and Sasha Hutchings, also helps keep things grounded, but watching Onaodowan is like seeing a bud unfurl. He comes across as stoic, almost stiff, early on, but his movements grow looser and more assured as Demascus confronts the things in his life he once refused to see. And to think, we might not have this captivating new show were it not for Tubi, the not-so-little-anymore streamer that picked it up after AMC Networks chucked it onto the write-off heap along with Moonhaven season two and other originals. Now, though, Demascus can join audacious, Black-led series that defy easy description like I'm A Virgo, The Vince Staples Show, as well as the slightly more straightforward genre show The Lazarus Project (Paapa Essiedu should just be in more shows, especially ones that aren't Harry Potter-related). Tubi doesn't have the most vaunted slate of originals, but backing more shows like Big Mood and Demascus should help garner some prestige.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This weekend, Londoners will celebrate Notting Hill Carnival, a multi-cultural evocation of Caribbean heritage maintained by their large West Indian immigrant community. On Labor Day, New Yorkers will do the same in Brooklyn. At a distance, the staunch political history of carnival can be easy to overlook on Instagram feeds full of beautiful Black people clad in feathers and rhinestones or neon paint and charcoal. But on the ground for Grenada's carnival – dubbed Spicemas for the island's trove of nutmeg, mace, cloves, and cinnamon – that legacy of rebellion is inescapable. By 3:30 AM J'ouvert morning – a time named for the French colonizers' term for dawn – I was up, slipping on some basketball shorts and a sports bra that I knew could be tossed out. I wrapped my shower-capped hair in a long black scarf that could go too. For J'ouvert, Grenadians “play”  – in the customary nomenclature – Jab Jab, a centuries old tradition of blackening their skin with molasses and tar (or, more recently, motor oil or sustainable charcoal oil), donning horned helmets, and parading to their distinct sub-genre of soca music. Post-emancipation, it became a satirical take on the way white masters saw Black folks – as subhuman and grotesque – and reflect the horrors of slavery back to them. Though Grenada's Jab Jab is distinct, it's a ritual that spans the West Indies, where Caribbeans marched to say, “You think I'm a Black demon? Some toted hyperrealistic props of bloody octopus tentacles in their mouths. As night grew to day, I saw the age range widen – elders danced joyfully in their black paint, a father doused his school-aged sons in oil as they splashed and played. I let random men pour their tubs of motor oil on me. So, that night, after bathing in the crystal blue ocean with sand and dish soap alongside hundreds of others (and two more showers), I wept in the bed of my Sandals suite. About 11 percent of Africans brought to Grenada as slaves between 1669 and 1808 are believed to have been Sierra Leonean, like my parents, whose direct lineage avoided the ships by grace alone. Many Grenadians are believed to be descendants of our own Temne tribe. I cried for everything my family has continued to endure there. I cried because with every video I WhatsApped my mom of Grenada's rolling hills, bright architecture, national dishes, skilled drummers, and limber dancers, she messaged back, “This might as well be Sierra Leone.” Grenada's Spicemas felt more African than I could have ever imagined. As the world shrinks for Africans, with growing travel to places like Lagos, Accra, Johannesburg, and Cape Town, carnival in Grenada strikes me as a necessary diasporic destination, too. Our Favorite Afropop Songs and Albums of 2025 So Far Rema Chose This Leading Lady for His New Video. Tracing Afrobeats' Yoruba Roots: ‘Wizkid Now Was Sunny Adé Then' “We want people to come to experience our culture and to do so respectfully,” says Fiona Compton, founder of Know Your Caribbean, an educational platform for West Indian culture and history with nearly half a million Instagram followers. She began obsessively studying Caribbean archives after seeing reductive representation of her people as a college student in London. “Take the initiative to come and to learn why it is we do what we do, so that way the culture will not become a parody of ourselves,” Compton warns potential visitors. We're not here to just perform and just be some pretty characters,” she says, nodding to the popular Fancy Mas traditions of Carnival Tuesday, which can be an expensive outing of bejeweled body suits, elaborate feathered wings, professional make-up, and endless rum and food. “We are here to go into something that's deeply spiritual.” on the song he competed with, “Viral Again.” “So happy to my neighbor/My neighbor happy to see me/Nobody here is strangers/One big family/We serving one creator/And we play mas tremendously.” It rides the same riddim, or beat, as Muddy's “Payroll,” which earned him the Soca Monarch title. “Payroll” is absolutely electric, with a moving music video of he and a crew playing Jab Jab like an army. While I spent Spicemas in the capital of Saint George's, where there are the most populous gatherings, Jab Jab musician, historian, and preservationist Ian Charles tells me there's a distinct authenticity to J'ouvert in the more rural parishes where massive plantations once dominated. “If you're looking for hardcore, pristine cultural drums on the road, no big music trucks, you got to go up to Saint Andrew and Saint Patrick,” he says. While the jab music of Soca Monarch is digitized and modern, like Afrobeats, in its traditional form, Grenadian jab soca consists of a three-hand-drum system – one for bass, one for melody, and one called a “kupai,” akin to the French word for “to cut.” Jab Jab players use the goat-skin dùndún drum of Nigerian, Yoruba lineage and the Malian djembe drum. The drum patterns, says Charles, are not far off from that of genres like Fuji and Juju. All these elements, Charles and Compton explain, were inherited from Africa. “The drum was used for lots of things,” says Compton. Now, people hear the drum and we cannot help but start moving. It lights up something inside of us.” Because of the revolts, Compton says, drumming and African spiritual practices were eventually criminalized in the colonies. As Black instruments were confiscated and burned, the new Caribbeans would abandon their plantations to perform secret rites in the forests, or remake their tools entirely. “That's how the invention of steel pan [drumming] happened,” Compton says as an aside. “Because all forms of African percussion were made illegal in Trinidad well into the 1930s, so Trinidadians decided to rebel against that. There are all kinds of flags too – mostly Caribbean, but I later met a queer Hondouran with their flag, and spotted a few Nigerians too. Yet, Soca Monarch was my first night of Spicemas, and I immediately felt at home. My family played so much soca at our parties that as a child, I assumed it was African music. I happened to run into the Ghanaian crew with the towering Black Star at Fancy Mas, and bolted to them. One of them is a neurosurgeon where I live.

They elected kings and queens in masquerades like the ones of Spicemas now. I say all this to say that while Spicemas is distinctly Grenadian, it is also very African, and proudly so.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CTS Eventim shares fell 16.6% and Spotify shares fell 5.4%, leading the Billboard Global Music Index to a 2.6% decline for the week ended Aug. 22. Gains by some live entertainment stocks and solid performances by multi-sector companies were overshadowed this week by German concert promoter CTS Eventim's double-digit decline and a more modest single-digit drop from Spotify. CTS Eventim shares fell 16.6% to 81.20 euros ($95.18) this week following Thursday's mid-year results that showed a sharp decrease in adjusted EBITDA despite the concert promoter achieving record revenue. Numerous analysts reacted by decreasing their price targets. MWB Research lowered its price target to 100 euros ($117.22) from 105 euros ($123.08) and upgraded its rating to “buy” from “hold.” The Billboard Global Music Index (BGMI) dropped 2.6% to 3,023.51, breaking a two-week winning streak and lowering the index's year-to-date gain to 42.3%. Winners outnumbered losers 10 to 8, and one company, Deezer, was unchanged. Other than CTS Eventim, live entertainment companies posted solid gains. Live Nation reached a new record of $166.54 on Friday and closed at $165.72, up 3.0%. Earlier in the week, MoffettNathanson initiated coverage of Live Nation with a $195 price target and Wolfe Research increased its price target to $177 from $173. The two Dolan family-controlled live entertainment companies bounced back from an off week. MSG Entertainment was the week's biggest gainer, rising 6.8% to $39.33. A week earlier, MSGE shares fell 3.1% after the company's earnings announcement revealed a 74% decline in fiscal year net profit and Sphere Entertainment shares fell 1.0% following second quarter earnings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The elder Menendez brother followed Erik's Thursday denial after a long day before state commissioners. A day after his younger brother was denied release from prison by the California Parole Board, Lyle Menendez's steady march toward earning his freedom back, 36 years after the two young men shot their parents to death in their Beverly Hills home, suffered the same fate when he was also denied release, a source with direct knowledge of the decision confirmed with The Hollywood Reporter. On Friday night, at the end of a 10-hour hearing, the Board agreed with an assessment submitted earlier this summer that both Erik and Lyle Menendez still pose a risk to public safety. Menendez Brothers Appearing Before California Parole Board in Long-Awaited Reckoning Lyle entered his hearing on Friday — which was attended by a separate representative from the L.A. District Attorney's office than the rep who was at Erik's hearing, as well as two separate Board commissioners, Commissioner Julie Garland and Administrative Law Judge Patrick Reardon — with the full knowledge of his brother's unsuccessful bid for freedom. Cited during the Thursday hearing were Erik's involvement with a prison gang in his early years locked up, possession of contraband cellphones, inappropriate behavior with visitors, drug smuggling and surprisingly, the fact that he killed his own mother was noted by the board members. But this was not enough to convince the parole board that he is suitable for release. Much of the discussion during Lyle's hearing centered around his use of burner cell phones while in prison, and the contraband items may be what ultimately did both brothers in. Erik Menendez was caught with a burner phone as recently as January, when he was well aware of the risk that having it posed to his release. Also brought up by the Board during Friday's hearing was Lyle's plagiarism while he was attending Princeton and the fact that he bribed witnesses to testify using scripts he's written during his initial trial. Commissioner Garner notes this when speaking of her decision to deny Lyle's release. “Citizens are expected to follow the rules whether or not there is some incentive to do so,” Garner said of  the brothers quick disposal, mostly, of contraband phones once their paths to freedom materialized. He told the board that he was sexually abused by his father between the ages of 6 and 8 and that Jose started abusing Erik when Lyle was 13, making Erik 10 at the time it began. At one point when they were children, Lyle abused his little brother; on Friday, he was questioned as to why he would do this. This will go before a Los Angeles judge and involve the new evidence unearthed and presented in a Peacock documentary in 2023. In the film, a member of the boy band Menudo admitted he was sexually abused by Jose Menendez and a letter Erik wrote to his cousin affirming the ongoing abuse was presented; both of these new elements back up their initial defense of years of sexual abuse that was not allowed in their second joint trial in 1996 where they were found guilty and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Under a 1988 state law, California's governor has a unique power to approve, deny or modify the decisions of the parole board in murder cases where the person was sentenced to an indeterminate term. At that point, Newsom has 30 days to affirm or reverse the decision, if he so chooses. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A day after his younger brother Erik was denied release on parole, Lyle Menendez was handed the same fate on Friday evening, with California prison officials ruling he remains a risk to public safety. It was a minimal denial of three years. Friday's decision means both brothers will remain in custody pending follow-up parole hearings in the coming years, or movement on their separate habeas petition seeking a new trial. (The brothers also have a clemency bid waiting on Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk, but with the parole board finding they're not yet fully rehabilitated, that avenue appears unlikely to succeed, at least for now.) On Friday, Lyle was openly emotional as he appeared by video from his San Diego prison. He apologized for the brutal killings and took responsibility for the “pain” he caused his surviving relatives, who now vocally support his release. “My Mom and Dad did not have to die that day,” he said through tears. Lyle said he had an “honest belief” at the time of the double murder that his parents “were going to kill” him. He now understands they were unarmed, not posing an immediate threat. At one point during the lengthy hearing, Lyle doubled over, crying and shaking, recalling a confrontation with Kitty shortly before the homicides. As she rendered the board's decision, Garland said Lyle's violence was impulsive and showed “poor threat perception.” She called the reloading and final shot that killed Kitty extremely “callous.” Both had numerous violations for using contraband cell phones, with Lyle having pleaded guilty to two such violations in November 2024 and March 2025, Deputy Parole Commissioner Patrick Reardon said. While both brothers told officials that they rationalized the use as not harming anyone, the commissioners pointed out that demand for and use of the devices corrupted and endangered prison staff, fellow inmates, and others. The second trial, which wasn't broadcast, ended with first-degree murder convictions. The brothers were sentenced to life without parole in 1996. Their resentencing in May made them immediately eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. Erik Menendez Denied Parole: ‘Unreasonable Risk to Public Safety' Lil Nas X Arrested for Battery of a Police Officer: Report Man Accused of Arranging Young Dolph's Murder Found Not Guilty Prosecutors said the brothers then opened fire with more than a dozen rounds of buckshot while their parents were watching TV on a couch in the family's den. Jurors saw horrific photos of the bloody crime scene. José was shot in the back of his head. Kitty was shot in the face at point-blank range as she was already wounded, bleeding, and trying to crawl away, prosecutors said. Prosecutors claimed the brothers carried out a cold-blooded, premeditated scheme to inherit their parents' money. They claimed José sexually abused them both, while Kitty did nothing to stop it. Their relatives have rallied around them, corroborating claims José was inappropriate with his sons. At the brothers' first trial, as well as at a May 2025 hearing for resentencing, cousin Diane VanderMolen testified that she was a teenager visiting the Menendez home when an eight-year-old Lyle told her his father was touching his genitals. At his separate hearing Thursday, Erik testified that José sexually assaulted him repeatedly. He said that on the night of the murders, his dad ordered him to his room, saying he would be upstairs soon. He recalled thinking that if he tried to run or expose the family's dark secret, his life would be in danger. “In my mind, leaving meant death,” he said. “It was confusing, caused a lot of shame in me. Lyle said the abuse stopped abruptly when he was eight, around the time his cousin Diane says she reported it to Kitty. “I think it's related to [José] being concerned that I would talk to people,” he said of the reprieve. Lyle said the abuse left him feeling a “total disconnection from everybody in my life growing up.” But in a twisted way, it also made him feel special. “I was the special son in my family. Lyle said he got “more attention” from his father, particularly on the tennis court, than Erik did. It was him and I in this bubble,” Lyle said, quoting his dad. “I wanted to believe my father loved me, so in my mind I felt like he was a great man, and my main way of dealing with it was that it was just a sickness that some great men have.” Lyle said his father could be physically violent in the home as well, lashing out in terrifying attacks separate from the sexual abuse. José was “very brutal with physical abuse: choking, punching, closed fists, using a belt,” he said. It was just surviving that moment,” he recalled. Lyle's solidarity with his younger brother infuriated their dad, he said. The younger sibling was “openly punished, spanked, viciously. My mother would drag him down the hall. The sensitive topic was raised at Erik's Thursday hearing as well, when Erik admitted he concealed from corrections staff that Lyle was “molesting [me] as a kid.” He described “pain training” sessions that were forced by his father, where he hurt Erik in a non-sexual way, as a possible form of pain endurance. In another striking statement, Lyle said his mother sexually abused him as well. “I didn't see it as abuse really. So I don't like to talk about it that way,” he said. When I was 13, I felt like I was consenting, and my mother was dealing with a lot, and I just felt like maybe it wasn't … it's abusive, but I never saw it that way, in the same way.” At that point, Lyle asked for a break, and the hearing moved to another topic. Lyle said he joined the burglary to keep an eye on his brother. He said afterward, José called him a “moron” for getting caught. When Garland asked why Lyle didn't talk about being disinherited by his parents in his submission to the board, Lyle said he believed “there was a will that disinherited us somewhere,” but it wasn't a motive for the murders. It only became “a problem afterwards,” he said, when they needed money once their parents were dead. Prosecutors claim the brothers murdered their parents out of greed. Lyle flatly denied that the murders were planned. He said buying the guns made the fatal shooting “more likely,” but he thought it was “de-escalating” at the time, meaning something that gave him a “measure of safety” and “emotional protection.” The two brothers discussed their belief José had threatened to harm them if the family's secret “ever got out,” but they had no plan to kill their parents when they bought the guns, Lyle said. He said after the murders, he dropped his gun and walked out of the room feeling “numb.” Lyle said his attempts to cover up the crime and recruit others to lie for his benefit were evidence of him “flailing,” not carrying out a sophisticated plan. Lyle said his mother's murder caused him the most sorrow because, after her death, he learned more about her life and difficult childhood, and “how much fear maybe she felt.” He learned from her therapist “that she felt shame,” he said. Asked about his own psychology, Lyle pushed back on assessments that found he posed a “moderate risk” of violence if released and suffered from “anti-social, narcissistic traits.” He said his dad was a narcissist, but he pursues self-reflection and tries to “understand” his personality. “My life has been defined by extreme violence. I wanted to be defined by something else,” Lyle said, in tears. When Garland asked Lyle about his recent romantic correspondence with three different women, Lyle said he remains closest to his wife, though they're no longer romantically involved. L.A. County Deputy District Attorney Ethan Millius argued Lyle's cell phone violations while leading the Men's Advisory Council at his prison proves he “struggles with honesty.” He said Lyle had eight violations in custody for which he was found guilty, though he conceded they were non-violent. It is just who Lyle appears to be,” Milius told the board in his closing argument Friday. District Attorney Nathan Hochman, Millius' boss, has made opposition to the Menendez brothers‘ release on parole a mainstay of his administration. “For more than three decades, both Erik and Lyle Menendez have advanced a false claim of self-defense, alleging they feared their parents were going to kill them, to justify the brutal murders of their parents,” he said in statement Thursday. Baralt said she once witnessed José tie Erik's legs together to correct an error with his swimming form. “I've heard so many times over the last 35 years, ‘Why didn't they just leave?' And thankfully, the criminal justice system has started to catch up with the brain science that trauma and childhood abuse create the illusion that there would have been no escape for Erik and Lyle.” Friday's hearing was thrown into disarray around 5 p.m. when Lyle and Erik's lawyer, Heidi Rummel, interrupted the proceeding to say audio from Erik's parole board examination on Thursday had been published by ABC News. In a series of clips posted online, Erik was heard describing the decision to buy the guns and open fire on his parents. She questioned the fairness of both hearings and asked that Lyle's proceeding be adjourned. Commissioner Garland said an interpretation of the public records act allowed the release, but she wasn't sure how long that policy had been in place.

The hearing then resumed with a curtailed statement from José's sister, Teresita Baralt. “I want my nephew to hear how much I love him, and believe in him,” she said in tears.
