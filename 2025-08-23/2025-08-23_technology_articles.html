                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel officially announced an agreement with President Donald Trump's administration on Friday afternoon, following Trump's statement that the government would be taking a 10% stake in the struggling chipmaker. While Intel says the government is making an “$8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock,” the administration does not appear to be committing new funds. Trump has been critical of the CHIPS Act, calling it a “horrible, horrible thing” and calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to “get rid” of it. In addition to his targeting of the CHIPS Act, earlier this month Trump also accused Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan of conflicts of interests and said he should “resign immediately.” The president was more positive about Tan on Friday, saying on Truth Social that he “negotiated this deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company.” Intel's announcement also says the government's investment will be “passive,” with no board seats or other governance and information rights.

President Donald Trump has commented that he will allow Nvidia to ship a Blackwell if it's at least 30% less performant than the company's top offering. However, it reversed this decision some three months later by issuing export licenses, allowing the company to resume sales in China in exchange for 15% of its sales in the country. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that this was part of the negotiations for China to loosen its grip on rare-earth minerals — a crucial resource required to produce semiconductors, high-tech equipment, and defense technologies. However, this was soon followed by warnings from Chinese state media saying that the H20 is unsafe and outdated, and the authorities have reportedly discouraged organizations, especially government bodies, from using it. All of this supposedly came from Sec. Lutnick's abrasive ‘addiction' comments, which the Chinese leadership called insulting. However, some experts say that Nvidia and its AI chips are being used as a political maneuvering tool by both sides, primarily as China and the U.S. are engaged in a trade war. “If the U.S. government were to approve a powerful Blackwell for China, even at a 30-to-50% performance reduction,” said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior adviser to RAND Corporation, a think tank with offices in Washington, D.C. “My guess is we'd miraculously see China forget about security concerns.” The company did not confirm this, though, only telling Tom's Hardware that it constantly manages its supply chain to match market conditions. Still, the AI giant is working to prepare a next-generation offering for H2O. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Make sure to click the Follow button.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Demand for high-performance server CPUs is quite high these days, both because of the AI boom and because traditional cloud service providers continue to expand their fleets. However, something unusual is happening on the retail market of data center processors in the U.S., as the latest EPYC 9005-series CPUs from AMD and Xeon 6 Performance-series CPUs from Intel are available with discounts of around 50%. We have inquired with both AMD and Intel about why their latest CPUs are available below list prices at retailers in the U.S. and are awaiting their response. Neither AMD nor Intel recently announced price cuts for their server offerings, but as we discovered today, virtually all high-end EPYC and Xeon CPUs — including the latest generation and previous generation SKUs — are now being sold well below their prices for direct customers at retail. If server processors from AMD and Intel were available below their list prices at a small retailer with no reputation, we would suspect the listings were merely fraud. However, two respected retailers — ShopBLT and Newegg — offer the latest EPYC and Xeon CPUs at steep discounts from their pricing guidelines, which means that these products can indeed be obtained relatively cheaply, or rather below their list prices (1000-unit prices for AMD, recommended customer price in case of Intel). Flagship server CPUs from AMD and Intel are quite expensive: the 192-core EPYC 9965 costs $14,813, and the 128-core Xeon 6980P is priced at $12,460 (after Intel had already slashed its price from $17,800 in early January) when purchased in 1000-unit quantities by its direct customers. AMD's top-of-the-line 192-core EPYC 9965 processor is officially priced at $14,813 when sold in batches of 1,000 units. However, ShopBLT offers it for $9,713 (about 35% below the official 1kU pricing) with an ETA of 15 days. A slightly less powerful 160-core EPYC 9845 is sold for $13,564 in 1kU quantities by AMD, but ShopBLT sells it for $8,896, a 35% reduction from AMD's 1kU pricing. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. AMD's previous-generation Zen 4-based EPYC 9004-series CPUs are also sold well below their recommended prices for direct clients. Intel's Xeon 6 6900P-series CPUs are sold at even steeper discounts from their RCPs. In general, these are benchmarks, not fixed retail prices. Real-world prices depend on many factors, including negotiated contracts, order sizes, and distributor channel incentives, among other things, so it's quite common for large cloud service providers (CSPs) or OEMs to get their CPUs below list prices. For now, we could see two possible reasons why brand-new server CPUs are available below their list prices. Intel and AMD are in fierce competition for data center market share, which may drive prices well below official RCPs. This head-to-head pressure could force distributors and retailers to undercut list prices, making high-end CPUs far cheaper in the open market. Also, both AMD and Intel are producing CPUs aggressively to secure market share in data centers. If supply briefly overshot immediate OEM demand, distributors may be offloading excess stock into retail channels, and to move volume, they could be discounting well below list prices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over its currently two-season run, Star Wars: Visions has shown audiences the adventures of Force users, droids, and rebels. One viewpoint we've not seen much of is the Imperial forces, despite their repeatedly turning up in the show's various shorts—but that's changing with the new season, and things will get pretty cerebral. During this weekend's Anime NYC, panelists got a look at “Black,” a short for the next set of episodes dropping in October. Developed by david production (Fire Force), the episode centers on an Imperial Stormtrooper on the verge of losing a battle and what's going on in their head during their final moments. Ohira went on to describe “Black” as something “nobody's ever seen before,” and an “arduous task” for the animators that he hopes is worth all the trouble. The article on the Star Wars website doesn't provide any clips or further story info, but Ohira promised the short “really speaks for itself”—and we'll see how well it talks when the third season of Star Wars: Visions hits Disney+ on October 29.

New Commodore owner Peri Fractic (AKA Christian Simpson) has posted an update on the success of the company since it made it safely into the arms of its fans. Moreover, we get a look inside the factory where the new Commodore 64 Ultimate computer is being made, details about the included operating system software, and even more teasers mentioning future products with flavors of Amiga technology. The money is now in escrow, it seems. Billed as the company's first hardware release in over 30 years, the new Commodore 64 Ultimate (and its less glamorous brethren) have been doing a roaring trade. Particularly strong take-up of the gold-hewn Founders Edition has helped boost receipts. What you see represents about $2 million worth of computers sold to customers. Of that $2 million, about half goes toward production, said Simpson. Subsequently, the name went through a low point (or two), lending its branding power to lowly commodity electronics, such as paper shredders. This shouldn't be allowed to happen again, and Simpson asserts his primary role now is to make sure the new Commodore “isn't a bankrupt Commodore.” During the latest episode from Retro Recipes, we see some of the new C64 machines being prepared in a factory. The manufacturing appears to be in the hands of, or affiliated with, PCB Way, which is based in China. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. We've clipped several screenshots showing the C64 Ultimate work-in-progress components and machines. During the factory tour, we see prototype designs and quality control measures in place ahead of mass production. It is encouraging that eyes are on those niggly details, such as alignment and logos. Simpson shows that he is busy working on the new C64 Ultimate menu system design (at approximately 8 minutes and 30 seconds). Shipping models should boot into the classic Basic prompt, it was noted. This is an ancient software suite that was well-suited for productivity. Thus, it is interesting to see more Amiga developments and products teased in the new video. Simpson claims there have been positive meetings about Amiga products and branding. However, later we see a recording of a video chat with Dave Haynie, the Chief Engineer of the Amiga 2000, 3000, and 4000 desktop computers (video, approximately 23 minutes). That would have brought 24-bit graphics and 3D support to the platform, while retaining backwards compatibility. Invited to collaborate, Haynie said he would “love to be involved.” Some parts of the Haynie conversation were obviously deleted, which only heightened anticipation. In the future, Simpson suggests Commodore will be a ‘Founders Sandbox' where all the alumni will be able to “brainstorm ideas and projects for potential official release.” Some of those products may (should) touch on the Amiga era. But they may also include calculators, we hear during a Simpson chat with Leonard Tramiel, who was appointed CTO – that's ‘Chief Tramiel Officer' - live in another video call that was shared. Simpson signed off by hinting at more modern products to come. Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The unofficial end of summer, a celebration of the American worker's contribution to our national prosperity, brings with it bargains on WIRED-tested gear, including home office essentials and some of our favorite gadgets. Updated August 23: We've added five new deals from Lectric, Ettitude, Joybird, Citizenry, and Plunge. We've also ensured pricing throughout and removed expired deals. The Sony Bravia 7 II has been on sale for this price for a little while, but we have yet to see it drop lower. It has natural yet vivid colors and excellent picture processing. Reviewer Ryan Waniata says it renders 4K and HD scenes “so clearly you'll feel like they're going to spill into your living room.” It could have better black levels and a few more ports, but it's still an excellent set, especially at this price. Our favorite electric scooter, the Apollo Go, manages to strike an excellent balance between features and price. It weighs 46 pounds and has maximum speeds of 28 miles per hour, though you can tweak top speed, brake strength, and acceleration response in the app. We haven't seen it sell for less. The XPress 750 is our favorite ebike for folks on a budget. The frame is comfortable and the pedaling feels natural, so it feels more like a classic bike and less like a lean, mean electric machine. The range could be better, but you'll have no trouble zooming around your neighborhood at top speeds of 28 mph. This is the best price we've seen thus far for our favorite Android tablet. You can watch videos (even outdoors in bright sunlight), play most games, and use the included stylus to take notes or efficiently browse the web. It comes in fun colors like blue and yellow, and it's plenty powerful to handle whatever you'll throw at it on a day-to-day basis—from playing games to streaming videos to browsing the web. It does have a modern bezel design around its 11-inch LCD screen, plus USB-C charging, a Touch ID sensor, and two 12-megapixel cameras—one in the back and one for selfies. It also works with many of the best iPad accessories. Where some MacBooks are overkill for basic everyday tasks, this lightweight model can handle them with ease—and you won't be paying for performance that you won't use. It has a bright display, long battery life, and support for up to two external displays as well as Apple Intelligence. And while you might want something else if you'll be doing heavy video editing or need a giant screen, the M4 MacBook Air will be capable of handling multiple Google Chrome tabs and apps running in the background. We do wish it had some more ports, but you can always use a USB hub to customize them further. They have excellent sound quality and battery life, plus solid control options, and they're comfortable to wear for long periods of time. But where they truly excel is in active noise canceling. They can make a busy subway car or crowded airplane disappear entirely, lending you extra focus or decompression with no effort. Branch has made our favorite office chair for years. If you don't want to spring for the Ergonomic Chair Pro, this is the best budget-friendly office chair and an option worth considering. and there are a few adjustable areas for a better fit—the armrests, seat, recline, and lumbar support can all be dialed in. There are some fun fabric color options, like blue and orange, though the upholstery does tend to pill and is a magnet for pet hair. For additional recommendations, check our home office buying guide. This coupon code gets you 20 percent off almost everything on Humanscale's website. Humanscale makes some of the best office chairs. Editor Julian Chokkattu said, “This chair gracefully supports my back like a mother gently laying a baby in a crib.” We also like the Humanscale Path, which is great for tight spaces and even comes in armless versions. The latex-wrapped coils help to alleviate any tension or pressure points while you're sleeping, and it's especially great for side sleepers. You can also get two pillows or a sheet set for free with your purchase. Check our roundup of Labor Day Mattress Deals for additional expert recommendations. It has a drawer at the foot of the bed that's handy for storing extra linens or off-season clothing, and it's sturdy too. I also appreciate that the platform lets me maneuver my mattress easily so I don't have to fight to change my sheets. This well-made, luxurious sofa is one of the best couches you can buy online. Operations manager Scott Gilbertson called it the best-looking and most comfortable couch he's ever sat on. The website lets you order swatches and pick the layout you want, and you can even get a full-size printout to make sure the couch will look right in your living space. There are dozens of options for upholstery, legs, and cushion fill, so you can create the couch of your dreams. The American-made pit has a fire bowl that's 2 feet wide, so it'll fit pre-cut wood, and there are a ton of accessories available. (We especially like the live-fire pizza oven, on sale for $723—a $128 discount). The hefty, sturdy base and natural patina (on the Corten steel option) make this a centerpiece worthy of any backyard. This is featured in our guide to the Best Kitchen Composters. It has the fastest compost breakdown of any model we tried. It has some quirks, like a lid that requires two hands to open and the machine's tendency to make a loud whirring noise as it works. It can heat up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit, and the triple-pane glass door always lets you see what's going on. And while you might miss out on some of the vibes that come with a fire-powered oven, the Volt can safely be used indoors and outdoors—so you won't have to brave the coming winter chill (or supply propane refills) to get your paws on some good 'za. Hydroviv makes one of the best shower water filters we've tested. This deal is for the automatically replenishing subscription bundle. Julian still has to see how the couch fares New York winters, but so far, it's sturdy and comfortable. We like that the couch is made with Forest Stewardship Council-certified wood. It's also backed by a 10-year warranty and available in four different fabric options. We've recommended the Albany Park Barton in our couch buying guide for years. It's soft and supportive, with deep seats and wide arms so you can put down your coffee cup or phone without needing an extra table. Assembly wasn't too difficult—just be prepared to take out a lot of recycling afterward. The couch also comes with a 30-day trial so you can try it before committing. Home Depot is offering up to 35 percent off a variety of appliances for Labor Day, including washing machines, dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers, and various bundles. This discount also applies to a few robot vacuums that we like from Roborock and iRobot, as well as a large selection of window air conditioners we recommend. If you're in the market for a new home appliance, this sale is worth checking out. This sheet set feels soft and silky, but stays cool to the touch, making it a great option for hot sleepers. This is the best lightweight percale cooling sheet set. The organic cotton is crisp without being crinkly or papery, and the eight different color options will mean there's at least one to coordinate with your bedroom. The Plunge Original pool being used to refill squirt guns during a water fight, which is not its intended purpose. Reviewer Martin Cizmar liked this full-featured cold plunge tub almost as much as his top pick, and it's significantly cheaper. It has a sleek, modern aesthetic, and the acrylic walls are easy to clean. We regret to inform you that while it is unpleasant to submerge yourself in near-freezing water, it has a number of notable health and wellness benefits that our testers have personally felt. If you want a great-looking cold plunge tub and you don't want to overpay for it, this deal is worth checking out. The Joybird Eliot Sleeper Sofa is comfy and has a slick, MCM silhouette. It's one of the best couches you can buy online. It's custom-made for you, with dozens of options and finishes available (including bright pink velvet, which I chose.) It has deep seats that can be removed to reveal a pull-out mattress (which is also surprisingly comfortable).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chipotle says it's jumping on the drone delivery bandwagon. This week, the company announced a new pilot program in Texas that will test the viability of airdropping customers' orders into their backyards for them. Certain customers in the Rowlette suburb of Dallas will be able to download the app for Zipline, Chipotle's new drone partner, and place their orders. Then, Chipotle staff will place the food orders at locations where they can be picked up by the drones, which will then fly to customers' homes. The press release states that a “small number of Zipline users will have access to Zipotle starting today, ahead of a broader service launch in the coming weeks.” Introducing Zipotle — all your favorites from @ChipotleTweets, now delivered faster by air pic.twitter.com/zZukZf0wV9 Zipline has a very reputable track record, having made a name for itself with aerial deliveries of medical supplies in countries with poor infrastructure. The company's work greatly reduced the amount of time it took to deliver life-saving materials to patients, Rwandan doctors have said. Such applications of drone technology—to provide vital materials to people who need them—seem like the exact sort of thing the autonomous delivery industry should be focused on. Thursday's press release includes some humorous comments from Zipline top exec, Keller Rinaudo Cliffton. “Starting today, families in the Dallas area can have food delivered by Zipotle and served for lunch or dinner. What once felt like science fiction is soon going to become totally normal.” Of all the trendy new tech applications, my feeling is that grocery delivery via drone is easily one of the goofiest. For 90 percent of us, there is almost no foreseeable benefit to having a flying robot deliver our home goods. The only real difference is that companies don't have to hire new delivery workers, and now there are drones clogging up the aerial byways around your house. That said, some studies claim that drone delivery can reduce carbon emissions, although it's not clear how solid the science on that is yet (for instance, a recent study found big carbon savings between drone delivery and deliveries made by diesel trucks but, then again, most burritos are not delivered by diesel trucks).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nothing says loving myself like putting on a pair of earbuds and telling the entirety of New York City to kindly, f**k off. Any pair worth its weight in plastic will have the option for ANC nowadays. But just because they all have it doesn't mean every pair of ANC buds is created equal. If you're like Bose and you put “quiet” in the name of your earbuds, one should expect a high degree of noise cancellation—even more so for a gen-2 product. And folks, I'm here to tell you (not quietly) that's exactly what the $299 Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd gen) bring to the table. Bose doesn't provide exact dB numbers on how much cancellation its newest QuietComfort Ultra earbuds block out, but anecdotally it feels like a lot. Bose's second-gen QuietComfort Ultra 2 earbuds still have class-leading ANC. On the subway, I felt extremely insulated from train noise and voices, which is incredible if you're trying to zone out on your commute to work or avoid any unwanted conversations. I also tested them at a busy coffee shop with lots of chatter and music playing, and they blocked out all of that racket adeptly when I started playing music. Even when I wasn't playing music, just sitting with the earbuds in my ears, it silenced most of the ambient noise. These might be the only earbuds I want on my next flight. Bose says it went back to the lab and adjusted its ActiveSense technology, which enables adaptive ANC in the QuietComfort Ultra 2 to make transitions in noise-cancellation levels “smoother.” If you actually do want to hear something, the QuietComfort Ultra 2 also have excellent transparency. By tapping and holding the side of the right earbud, you can switch from “Quiet” to “Aware” mode, which turns off ANC and allows you to hear your surroundings. I wouldn't normally do this, for politeness' sake, but I tested Bose's second-gen QuietComfort Ultra buds' transparency mode by having some conversations with them in, including an exchange at a pharmacy. Even with my ears plugged up, I didn't miss a beat. I still hate having my ears blocked when I talk to people, since I can hear my voice reverberate in my own head (yuck), but if you need to have a conversation quickly and don't want to pop the buds out, you can at least hear other people easily. That might be annoying in some cases, like if you accidentally brush your bud while fixing your hair or taking off a hat, but I actually think this is a perk. I've used a lot of underwhelming touch controls in my day, and these are not among them. Personally, I'd rather have touch controls be oversensitive than under. I would say they even manage to push the envelope in the bass department, which was a lot bassier, for lack of a better word, than I was expecting. If you don't like the out-of-the-box tuning, you can switch things up in the Bose app with custom and preset EQ. There's a smooth metal strip along the stem with some Bose branding. Just like the SoundLink Plus, Bose's newest Bluetooth speaker that I also recently tested, I find the QuietComfort Ultra 2 to be an appealing blend of minimalism and creativity. If you want 3D audio, you can switch the buds to “Immersion” mode which which tracks audio to your head movements, there's an ear tip fit test in the Bose app, custom EQ, and one cool feature in this generation is that you can now see the case's battery levels in your app, so you know when you need to charge it up. Speaking of battery, Bose says the QuietComfort Ultra 2 get up to 6 hours of battery with ANC on, but that figure drops (naturally) to 4 hours if you have Immersive audio activated. That case holds 24 hours of juice, so about three full charges. The fact is, Bose's QuietComfort Ultra 2 do one thing really well, and that's block out noise. In some cases, only having one great feature could be considered a flaw, especially for earbuds that cost $299, but ANC is one of the main reasons why people buy wireless earbuds in the first place, so Bose seems to have focused its energy in the right direction. While these earbuds aren't giving you the same level of hi-fi sounds as some other similarly priced earbuds on the market, they reward you in dividends when your neighbor is having a raucous party, once again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Air conditioners have been working overtime this hot summer, from those tiny window units to the massive AC towers that serve the tightly packed apartment buildings in major cities. And while they bring the relief of cool air, these contraptions also create the conditions for dangerous bacteria to multiply and spread. One particularly nasty bacteria-borne illness is currently spreading in New York City using those enormous cooling units as its vector: Legionnaire's disease. The bacterial pneumonia, which usually recurs each summer in the US's largest city, has sickened more than 100 people and killed five in a growing outbreak. If you don't live in New York City or the Northeast, you may never have heard of Legionnaire's, but this niche public health threat may not be niche for much longer. Around 5,000 people die every year in the United States from Legionnaire's disease, many of them living in low-income housing with outdated cooling equipment where the bacteria can more readily grow and spread. Legionnaire's disease is a microcosm of climate change's impact on low-income communities. Soon, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists confirmed the cause of the mysterious illness: a previously unknown bacteria that was accordingly named Legionella. Legionella, unfortunately, is everywhere—in streams, lakes, and water pipes across the country. Now, city health officials have found the bacteria in the large cooling tanks that serve massive apartment buildings across New York City, particularly in Harlem. Cooling tanks are ideal places for Legionnaire's to grow and spread. They're filled with stagnant, warm water that is more hospitable to bacterial growth. Like an evaporative cooler, the systems convert warm stagnant water into cool air for apartment dwellers. For starters, the quality of natural water is degrading—creating more favorable conditions for Legionella, which loves acidic water and low oxygen levels, to multiply—as the planet warms. A decade ago, researchers warned that “climate change might increase the incidence of legionellosis through increased reliance on air-conditioning systems,” especially the large units serving city housing buildings. The European Climate and Health Observatory advised in 2022 that higher temperatures and the increased rainfall associated with climate change could soon make Legionnaire's disease a more widespread issue. And those who live in a low-income area are more likely to be at risk from this increased prevalence of Legionnaire's disease. As The New York Times reported recently, poorly maintained cooling systems are more likely to see Legionella flourish and pump the bacteria into their neighborhoods—and low-income housing is more likely to be poorly maintained. Though NYC attempted to require more inspections for defective cooling systems after a 2015 outbreak of Legionnaire's, inspections have fallen off in recent years, according to reporting from The Gothamist. Legionnaire's is a particularly disconcerting health threat: It rains down from the sky in tiny invisible droplets, packed with bacteria so potent it can kill one in 10 people whom it manages to infect through its telltale aggressive pneumonia. I asked some experts what people can do about Legionnaire's disease. The most important advice was to be vigilant about any public health warnings if you reside in an area where Legionella has historically lived or has recently been detected, especially if you have certain preexisting conditions like diabetes, chronic lung disease, or autoimmune disorders, or if you're over the age of 50. Follow the news and make sure you're registered for alerts from your local public health officials. People could consider investing in a high-quality water filter during an outbreak, the CDC says. But the issue here is ultimately not your small humidifier. You can't suddenly stop drinking water or breathing air, of course, even if there is a local outbreak. The CDC itself notes that point-of-use water filters only provide limited protection. So, whenever you know Legionnaire's disease is spreading nearby, you should be paying attention to your body, said Janet Stout, president and director of the Special Pathogens Laboratory, who has studied the disease for 30 years. See your doctor immediately if you're experiencing fever, shortness of breath, or a cough. You could have a special test done for Legionnaire's disease and potentially receive antibiotics, such as levofloxacin or azithromycin, that have proven effective against the bacteria. Most cases can be cured if they are caught early enough. But this is a truly public health challenge; when bacteria are multiplying in community water systems and then spewing into the open air, anyone can be exposed. There is only so much that any one person's own, individual effort can do to stop infections. The main way to prevent Legionnaire's disease, however, or at least significantly reduce its risk is by staying on top of maintenance to make sure community water sources are kept clean, preventing the bacteria from proliferating. But that kind of maintenance requires vigilance and perhaps even public pressure. Landlords and public health authorities must take Legionnaire's disease seriously.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Now, they're making their own pair of smart specs. Former Harvard students Caine Ardayfio and AnhPhu Nguyen this week announced Halo, a startup of roughly 11 people working to develop always-recording smart glasses. The pair dropped out of Harvard to develop Halo X, smart glasses with a display on the lens that can answer any question someone asks. Powered by a combination of Google's Gemini and Perplexity large language models, the idea is that these glasses will always be listening to the world around you via the built-in microphones (there won't be a camera in this first model.) The processing will still run from your phone. “We're trying to build smart glasses that make people super intelligent,” Ardayfio tells WIRED. If you have a pair of smart glasses from Even Realities, you can give the startup's Halo app a spin (it's in beta). But the plan is for Halo to craft a custom pair by the first quarter of 2026, with an estimated cost between $300 and $500. Here's more you may have missed this week: AI-powered always-on recording wearables are having a moment in 2025—Amazon recently acquired one such startup called Bee AI, which makes a wrist-worn always-recording wearable. These devices transcribe the people around you, and often summarize your day, with the ability to extrapolate tasks and insights from your conversations. Halo X will have these features too—you can talk to it like you would a voice assistant—but its focus is on speedily delivering answers to questions during real-life conversations. Much of the processing will happen in the cloud on Halo's servers with standard encryption, and Halo says it will never train on, share, or sell your conversations. Should you tell the people you're around that your glasses are recording conversations, even if no audio files are stored? “Every big company understands that wearables are potentially the next computing interface," Nguyen says. "Startups have that advantage that if we ship fast and move fast, and still do it as high quality, we can quickly gain market share.” Meta is expected to unveil its display-enabled smart glasses in September, and the first wave of Google's Android XR smart glasses will arrive in 2026. The device looks like a squashed HomePod Mini, with a ring of LEDs on the underside that light up when Gemini speaks. It's finally replacing Google Assistant, and that means you'll be able to interact with the assistant much more naturally and control all of your smart home devices without having to say rigid commands. That includes Gemini Live for a much faster back-and-forth conversation with the assistant. Google's blog post says early access to Gemini for Home will begin in October, and it will replace Assistant on existing speakers and displays “over time.” That might suggest a new Nest Speaker will kick off the new capabilities. Last week, we reported that Apple had “redesigned” its blood oxygen sensing tool to get around a patent infringement suit brought by Masimo, and that blood oxygen sensing had returned to the Apple Watch Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2. On Wednesday, August 20, Masimo sued US Customs and Border Protection, saying that CBP had unlawfully allowed Apple to reactivate the feature, as reported by Bloomberg Law. In addition, Masimo also noted that this reversal comes after Apple committed an additional $100 billion in US investment for a total of $600 billion, in a ceremony where Apple CEO Tim Cook presented Trump with an engraved glass disk mounted on a 24K-gold base. For the time being, your Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2 have blood oxygen sensing; we will soon see whether this year's Watch 11 will have it as well. Video now tops out a 4K 60p (up from 4K 30p), but the details are much sharper with less blurring in motion shots. Earlier this year, I noted that no other fitness tracker I've tested has generated as much interest as a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which tracks what you eat by measuring glucose in your interstitial fluid via a small filament that goes under your skin on an always-on sensor. This week, Signos has launched the first third-party, FDA-cleared system that incorporates the Dexcom Stelo sensor with an AI-powered app that lets users see in granular detail how food, exercise, sleep, and activity level affect their metabolic health. When I tested a continuous glucose monitor, I found it extremely stressful to monitor my food intake at this level of detail, but I think that anyone who wants this information should be able to get it. Now you can, along with an increased level of detail and personalized, actionable recommendations. On a bike, a power meter measures how hard you're pedaling and is generally considered the most accurate measurement of how hard you're working. It a necessary accessory if you are training to be better at cycling. Most power meters are expensive, large, and attach to your crankset or pedals, but this week, BikeOn launched a tiny, affordable power meter that purports to measure your power output via a palm-sized clip that attaches near your front derailleur. The device has guides and gears that your chain passes through, which is how it measures activity. It requires no tools, will connect via Bluetooth to your phone, and will provide you with metrics like power output, cadence, torque, and balance measurements. If this is accurate—and that is a big if, since chains, you know, get broken or dirty all the time—the CycleClick could open a whole new world of cycling metrics for bike enthusiasts who want to get better and fitter but just don't have the cash for a specialized power meter. There's nothing else on the market that looks quite like this, and we are excited to test it. While there is no built-in flash, Ricoh has announced a tiny external flash unit, the GF-2, for those who want the additional versatility. The GR IV will be available in mid-September for $1,499, which is a significant jump from the GR III, which was $899 when it launched.
