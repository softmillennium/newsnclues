Some players have refused to sign a contract despite having the pen in their hand, while others have gone into hiding to avoid a transfer

As we all know, football is no longer a sport. It's a business - and a pretty ruthless one at that. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the transfer market, where money is king and the idea of a 'gentleman's agreement' is utterly laughable. This is why it's so naive for supporters to think that a 'Here we go!' is akin to confirmation that a deal has been done.

In reality, clubs cannot take anything for granted until a player signs on the dotted line, given there are all sorts of things that can go wrong at the 11th hour. Remember, even a faulty fax machine can scupper a proposed move!

However, the biggest threat to the completion of a transfer is last-minute interest from elsewhere - as Tottenham have once again discovered to their considerable cost. So, with Eberechi Eze's move to Arsenal in mind, GOAL runs through the most dramatic hijackings in football history:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When is the FIFA World Cup draw 2026? Donald Trump confirms date, venue for ceremony originally appeared on The Sporting News The 2026 FIFA World Cup is closing in, with less than a year to go until the unprecedented event held across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The draw is a huge event in itself, with fans of every participating nation excited to find out not just who they will play, but also when and where. The 23 host cities across the World Cup will also be eager to discover which teams will be welcomed to their venue. With the final set for MetLife Stadium in New York, all 48 teams will be eyeing a deep run to international glory. MORE:Where is the 2030 FIFA World Cup? U.S. president Donald Trump announced the event alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino on Aug. 22 in the Oval Office. During the announcement, Trump broke a long-held superstition that only World Cup winners should touch the World Cup trophy, handed the famed centerpiece by Infantino. The president held for a moment before placing it down on his Oval Office desk, quipping, "That's a beautiful piece of gold, can I keep it?" Trump was referencing a viral moment earlier this summer when he revealed Infantino let him keep the original Club World Cup trophy. According to Adam Crafton of The Athletic, the decision to hold the draw in D.C. surprised not only fans and media, but many of those within FIFA and the 2026 World Cup committee as well. For the first time, the 2026 FIFA World Cup will feature 48 teams, necessitating a new draw format. The three co-hosts, USA, Canada, and Mexico, have all been pre-drawn into groups. The draw will largely consist of the same format it has in recent years, just on a larger scale.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With just over a week remaining before the transfer window closes in Europe's top leagues, clubs are making final decisions on key players. That includes Giovanni Reyna, teammate of Christian Pulisic at USMNT, who appears close to departing Borussia Dortmund. “The total transfer fee is up to €7m (approximately $8.2 million) – €3m guaranteed plus €4m in potential add-ons. Around €3m of those are considered realistic bonuses,” Plettenberg added Saturday in a post on his X account. Over six seasons, he made 146 appearances and scored 19 goals, including a brief loan spell with Nottingham Forest in the Premier League in 2024. When he debuted with Borussia Dortmund in early 2020, he was just 17 years and 66 days old, breaking the record previously set by Christian Pulisic at the same club. In his early days as a professional, he also achieved other milestones, such as being the youngest goalscorer in German Cup history and the third-youngest player to appear in a UEFA Champions League knockout-stage match. Now, at nearly 23 years old and with substantial experience under his belt, the opportunity at Borussia Monchengladbach could mark a turning point in his career. That's why his pursuit of a return to top form could also greatly benefit USMNT in the near future. At the same time, though, he has faced setbacks in major tournaments. The most recent example came during the 2025 Gold Cup, where Reyna was notably absent from Mauricio Pochettino's final squad, along with Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tim Weah. In this case, Gio was not released by Borussia Dortmund due to the club's participation in the FIFA Club World Cup. World Soccer Talk, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gio Reyna has completed arguably the most badly-needed move in the entire U.S. men's national team pool, with Borussia Mönchengladbach announcing he had signed a three-year deal after a transfer from Borussia Dortmund. The clubs did not announce a transfer fee, but Sky Germany reported that the move will cost Die Folen €3 million up front, with a possible €4 million in possible bonuses. "I'm delighted that the transfer has been able to be completed and am looking forward to getting to know everyone here, as well as tackling the upcoming games together," said the USMNT playmaker, whose place with the national team was under some pressure thanks to a stuttering club career. During the 2024-25 season, Reyna started just five times, playing a total of 627 minutes for Dortmund. 7 shirt to new signing Jobe Bellingham earlier this month, while USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino has repeatedly spoken about the importance he places on players getting on the field regularly ahead of the World Cup next summer. He experienced a very rapid rise at BVB at the beginning of his career, culminating in the 2021 [DFB Pokal] victory," said Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl in his club's release confirming the move. "Unfortunately, his development in recent seasons has not progressed as we all hoped. "This is one of the reasons why it is now time for him to begin a new chapter in his sporting career. The next step for Reyna will be entirely on him, as he'll have to find a way into manager Gerardo Seoane's preferred lineup. With Seoane often playing out of a 4-2-3-1 and Reyna able to play centrally or on either flank, the system involved shouldn't be a major issue. Attacking midfielder Kevin Stöger and wingers Franck Honorat and Robin Hack are first-choice, with the latter pair likely more well-established in starting roles.</p>

Cristiano Ronaldo became the first player to score 100 competitive goals for four different clubs on Saturday, though Al-Nassr lost to Al-Ahli in a penalty shootout after the Saudi Super Cup final ended 2-2.

The first half strike at Hong Kong Stadium took the 40-year-old to his century for the Saudi Arabian club, which he joined in Dec.2022.

It adds to his 450 goals for Real Madrid, 145 for Manchester United and 101 for Juventus and moves Ronaldo ahead of the three players who had scored 100 times for three clubs: Isidro Langara, who played in Spain from 1930 to 1948, as well as Brazilian stars Romario and Neymar.

Ronaldo, who has yet to win a major trophy in Saudi Arabia, is also the leading international goalscorer with 138 goals for Portugal.

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner put Al-Nassr ahead after 41 minutes with a penalty, though Franck Kessie quickly equalized for Al-Ahli.

With seven minutes remaining, Marcelo Brozovic restored Al-Nassr's lead but there was still time for Brazilian defender Ibanez to head home a corner and take the game into a penalty shootout.

Ronaldo scored once more from the spot but his teammate Abdullah Al-Khaibari did not and Al-Ahli won 5-3 to lift the first trophy of the Saudi Arabian season.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has put the FIFA World Cup 2026 tournament firmly in the American political crosshairs. The president on Friday announced that the 48-team World Cup draw will be held on Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., NBC News reported. Trump has caused controversy by taking effective control of the venerated arts center, which is named after assassinated President John F. Kennedy. The World Cup draw will let countries across the globe know who their tournament opponents will be. Alluding to the Kennedy Center controversy, Trump on Friday quipped, “Some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we're not prepared to do that quite yet. Maybe in a week or so,” according to Newsweek. Trump has been deeply involved in World Cup events. He attended the FIFA Club World Cup Final at MetLife Stadium this year and has spoken regularly with FIFA president Gianni Infantino. The World Cup will kick off in Mexico with two matches on June 11, 2026. MetLife will host the World Cup Final on July 19, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Athletic reported on Friday that Gladbach had agreed a deal in principle to sign the USMNT international and he underwent a medical ahead of the transfer on Saturday. With Reyna's Dortmund contract set to expire next summer, the club felt a long-term extension to his deal would not make sense for either party. Midfielder Gio Reyna has completed a move to league rivals Borussia Mönchengladbach with immediate effect. Wishing you the best in your next chapter, Gio! The move to Gladbach sees him link up with international team-mate and close friend Joe Scally, with whom he came through the NYCFC ranks. Clubs in Spain and Portugal previously looked at the attacking midfielder, while Parma in Italy had also previously expressed an interest. He became the youngest player to make 50 Bundesliga appearances aged 18 years and 14 days, a record that has since been broken by Florian Wirtz, but his game time has been limited in recent seasons. Reyna has only started 14 Bundesliga games since the beginning of the 2021-22 season, and made 26 appearances last season with just five of those as a starter. Reyna was sidelined for two and a half months last season, missing 19 games for club and country, after picking up a groin issue in early September 2024. He was not included in Mauricio Pochettino's Gold Cup squad this summer as Dortmund wanted him to be a part of the Club World Cup squad. Capped 32 times since receiving his first USMNT call-up in November 2020, Reyna has featured 147 times for Dortmund, scoring 19 goals and providing 18 assists. It's been several years since he was a consistent member of the first team: he started three Bundesliga games last season and just one the year before. The need for a career reset is self-evident and perhaps Gladbach, who remain a big club, albeit one some way down from its historic peaks in the 1970s, can be an ideal venue to rediscover some momentum. Instead, it was availability, and Reyna's struggle to avoid the small muscular issues that have so often derailed his progress and prevented him from establishing a rhythm at the Westfalenstadion. Ultimately, that is why the club have allowed his contract to run down and now, with a year left until its end, are happy to allow him to leave. Can Reyna regain his status in the game? For now, though, the aim is simpler: he must find somewhere to play consistently.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, just hours before President Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino's latest joint briefing in the White House, the MGM Resorts group in Las Vegas received a courtesy correspondence. The expectation of many involved in next summer's World Cup plans had been that the competition's draw would take place in Las Vegas. There had, however, always been a but that never went away. That but, first reported by The Athletic in April, was that Washington, D.C. — and, more precisely, Infantino — wanted to ensure it would be easy for Trump to participate in the draw, if he wished. According to sources familiar with the discussions, who wished to remain anonymous to protect relationships, the venue was suggested by Trump's administration, and Infantino fell into line, despite numerous FIFA officials preferring Las Vegas. FIFA declined to comment, and a White House spokesperson did not directly address the point, instead sending through a transcript of Friday's press conference. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the center would have “no more drag shows or anti-American propaganda.” His administration removed 18 board members who had been appointed by his predecessor, Joe Biden, to what used to be a bipartisan board, while appointing those loyal to Trump, such as his chief of staff Susie Wiles and Usha Vance, the wife of Vice President JD Vance. Rep. Bob Onder (R-MO) last month introduced the Make Entertainment Great Again legislation, which seeks to rename the Kennedy Center after Trump. Onder said he would be “hard-pressed to find a more significant cultural icon in the past 40 years” than Trump, while Trump joked about the name change in Friday's news conference alongside Infantino. FIFA's choice of venue for their World Cup draw represents the latest episode of FIFA appearing to bend over backwards to please Trump. The Club World Cup final culminated in a ceremony in which Trump presented Premier League team Chelsea with the trophy. Infantino formed part of a bizarre event in the Oval Office in June, when the Italian team Juventus — with its owner, chief executive and leading players in tow — was taken along to a press conference with Trump on the afternoon of their Club World Cup match against Al Ain in D.C. FIFA has remained publicly tight-lipped about where it would hold its draw for the 48-team competition. Negotiations with venues in Las Vegas advanced, and the direction of travel was such that the U.S. Soccer Federation even reserved an events space and hotel rooms as they sought to host a soccer-specific conference around the draw, when many key stakeholders were expected to be in the city. It was a star-studded, highly Americanized edition of the draw, featuring Las Vegas appearances from James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Barry Manilow, Sir Rod Stewart and Robin Williams. Along the way, other locations were quickly ruled out. Canada and Mexico are each due to host 13 of the 104 World Cup games in a tournament spread across North America, yet Infantino is far more frequently seen rubbing shoulders with Trump than his Canadian or Mexican counterparts. The Athletic has been frequently told in recent months that sporting and political leaders in Canada and Mexico have been irritated by their increasingly diminished profile around the build-up to next year's tournament and Friday's events, which saw the draw location announced by one country's leader, is unlikely to have helped matters. Trump, who was in his first presidential term when the joint bid for 2026 won in 2018, joked on Friday that the U.S. “did a little” for Canada and Mexico by allowing them to share the tournament. They spoke privately of wanting to turn the draw into an entertainment spectacle, mirroring the excitement experienced during drafts in North American sports. FIFA trialled certain Americanisms during the Club World Cup: introducing NBA-style individual walk-ons for players, hiring Michael Buffer for a pre-game “Let's get ready to rumble!” and producing a half-time show during the final at MetLife Stadium. T-Mobile Arena, home of hockey's Vegas Golden Knights, was another option FIFA liked, but the NHL regular-season schedule had not yet been released, making it hard to plan. FIFA asked about the smaller Dolby Live arena — a 6,400 capacity — but MGM wished to hold the venue for residencies and holiday concerts, particularly eager to entice Mariah Carey back. December is a popular time for tourists, but Las Vegas hosts the National Finals Rodeo between Dec. 4-13 at the Thomas & Mack Center. In 2024, more than 170,000 people attended the event across 10 days. Amazon's 60,000-person conference event, AWS re:Invent, is being held in Las Vegas between Dec. 1-5. Talks were held with resorts and Amazon to clear the required space for hotel rooms. FIFA held extensive negotiations with the 17,000-seat MGM Grand Garden Arena, and a deal was close in May, only for FIFA to stall for several months while weighing up its options. As first reported by Sports Travel Magazine, a group — which The Athletic understands to be MGM — held back thousands of hotel rooms for FIFA's benefit, right until the middle of August when they could no longer afford to risk leaving rooms empty during the holiday season. FIFA held conversations with Resorts World, which briefly became the favorite. It all led several venue executives in Las Vegas to suspect FIFA might be taking the event elsewhere this month. On Friday morning, MGM was thanked by FIFA for its part in the process, and they were disappointed, to put it mildly, at the outcome. They had never been formally told that Las Vegas would be the destination, but it had been hinted at in some discussions. The host cities liked Las Vegas partly because it would have been seen as more politically neutral than an event space chaired by Trump in D.C. They wanted to entertain prospective sponsors in Sin City, while D.C. is perceived as a more dry experience. Some host city executives are even unsure whether they will attend the draw, when they could make more exciting watch-along events for sponsors in host cities. The disappointment of the host cities is expected to come through loud and clear during an upcoming workshop with FIFA officials in Houston. Some feel that the Kennedy Center, while steeped in heritage, is more suited to a black-tie event or an arts performance than the type of party atmosphere they want to launch the World Cup. US Soccer, meanwhile, is working to pivot its own conference out of Las Vegas and into D.C. While conversations advanced with Vegas, the background noise of D.C. did not go away. The Athletic reported in April how some within FIFA had internally floated the White House as a slimmed-down choice of venue. This, however, would have been logistically testing, particularly given the size of the event, which usually requires thousands of attendees, while the security operation involved — particularly given some of the strained relations with certain countries that could be in attendance — may have posed challenges. Sponsors may also have been uneasy about placing their products inside such an explicitly political venue. Some sources in Las Vegas wondered whether the D.C. threat may be a negotiating tactic by FIFA, aimed at maximizing concessions from resorts. After all, Trump, who has a hotel in Las Vegas, could have travelled to the draw. He sent a video message for the FIFA Club World Cup draw held in Miami in December 2024, during an event that his daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and grandson Theo attended. Right now, the Kennedy Center — or the Trump-Kennedy center, as it may or may not soon be known — is the president's territory, and we should never underestimate Infantino's desire to impress Trump. Infantino held his closing press conference of the Club World Cup in the gold-plated lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan. He attended Trump's inauguration this year and posted 10 times that week on Instagram about the new U.S. president, even wearing a red tie to Sunday's pre-inauguration rally. We can expect Trump to be front and center once more when the draw comes on Dec. 5. We have it all set that they can stay there for the big events, the big press conferences, and everything else.” (Top photo: Annabelle Gordon / UPI / Bloomberg via Getty Images)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Read the full transcript of President Trump's remarks on FIFA World Cup, Putin, DC Crime from Oval Office on August 22, 2025. Trump delivers remarks from the Oval Office alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino regarding the FIFA World Cup, while also addressing DC crime statistics and economic updates. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much, we have a very big announcement to make today. You all know Gianni, he came all the way from Italy, the beautiful country of Italy to be with us. He just got off the plane and he's a hardworking guy, does a phenomenal job with FIFA, nobody like him. I'm delighted to welcome FIFA President Gianni Infantino back to the White House for a major announcement about one of the most anticipated competitions in all of sports, the 2026, and this is a big deal, I'll tell you, I was so happy to get it, the 2026 FIFA World Cup. That's going to be the World Cup as we know it, it's the biggest, probably the biggest event in sports, I guess, Gianni, right? On December 5th of this year, the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center, some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we're not prepared to do that quite yet, maybe in a week or so, but right here in Washington, D.C. It's a tremendous honor to bring the global event and this incredible group of people and these unbelievable athletes, the best athletes in the world, to the cultural center of our nation's capital, just left the Kennedy Center. We're spending a lot of money wisely on making it really beautiful, it's going to be beautiful again, it's like Washington, D.C. We had, by the way, in Washington, D.C., we have the lowest crime numbers they've had in years, zero, it sounds like it's a horrible thing to say, but I might as well say it, zero murders in the last week since we've done this, that's the first time in memory that that's happened, if you can believe it, how pathetic that is to have to even say it. And I'm tired of listening to these people say how safe it was before we got here, it was unsafe, it was horrible, and Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor very long, because we'll take it over with the federal government, run it like it's supposed to be run. The numbers were horrible, it was a crime infested rat hole, and they do have a lot of rats, we're getting rid of them too, and we've made a lot of progress, and it was extremely unsafe, and now it's extremely safe, we had virtually no crime, the number was down 87%, and I'm trying to figure out where was the 13%, because I don't think it existed. The National Guard has been unbelievable, and they're working with the police, and they have some very good people in there, they have some people that shouldn't be police, actually, but they have some great people there, and Washington, D.C. That was the other thing I saw numbers, that restaurant business is down in the last week, I know, restaurant business, you can't get into a restaurant, just really lying people, and that's why people don't understand how bad and how dishonest the press is. I saw one poll that had us at 19% favorable on what we're doing with Washington, then I saw another one that says it's 94% favorable, and I can tell you that 94% is correct, the others are fake, just fake news, they got to get their act together, so bad for our country, so sick, actually. So Washington, D.C. is really doing unbelievably well, and the Kennedy Center that we're fixing, I was just there all morning with the contractors, we're making it, it's going to be unbelievable, it's got great bones, but it needs a lot of work. The World Cup draw will set up the group stage with competition, 48 teams will play in 104 games across 16 North American cities, from Seattle to Vancouver to Atlanta to Miami, it's going to be so exciting for our country. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be one of the largest and most complex events, this will be one of the greatest events, in a way it's like Gianni said it better, it's like having many Super Bowls in a short period of time, because each one of these games essentially is a Super Bowl, some of them are bigger than Super Bowls actually, but they're essentially, each one of these games is like a Super Bowl. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the largest, most complex set of events in sports history, and the Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kickoff, and we'll be involved, and they'll be working over there for quite a bit of time, we have it all set that they can stay there for the big events, the big press conferences and everything else, and they'll be in a very safe capital, that'll be nice, you don't have to worry about walking down the street, Gianni, okay? Already, FIFA is projecting 6 million loyal fans will attend the World Cup events next year, and 6 billion more are going to be watching back home, and they think the 6 billion number is going to be actually a low number, and this will drive more than 30 billion dollars into the U.S. economy, and create 185,000 American jobs in a short period of time. No sporting event attracts more attention, more fans, more viewers, or more revenue than the FIFA World Cup, and again, I'll just say, it's the World Cup, and it's the biggest thing there is in sports, and we have it, and I got it in my first administration, and I was really somewhat devastated, as devastated as I can be, I don't have time to get too devastated. I was very happy today, as you saw, the group that does this, the government group, radical left group, announced that Trump was right, took in 4 trillion dollars worth of tariffs, that the 4 trillion dollars are going to reduce the deficit by numbers far greater than they ever expected or heard of, and by the way, the stock market went up 1,000 points. That was as of 10 minutes ago, I can't tell you what happened, a lot of things happened, but the stock market's up almost 1,000 points, and it's basically on the news that the release that just came out from government that the tariffs that everybody was talking about, that the whole world respects us for, because of what we did, the tariffs are going to be at 4 trillion dollars, they're going to reduce the deficit by 4 trillion dollars. Mr. Vice President, what do you think? VICE PRESIDENT: That's pretty good, sir. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Too bad it's not 5, right? PRESIDENT TRUMP: It's had a huge impact, and the stock market is way up. But this will drive more than 30 billion dollars in U.S. economy and create 185,000 American jobs. No sporting event attracts more attention or more fans or anything else, and I just look forward to the draw, so we're going to have the draw, essentially, Gianni, at the Kennedy Center, and by that time, it'll be in even better shape, we're working on it, it'll take, it's about a year project to make it, it'll be great, it'll be fantastic. You see the way this is looking, look, nice? I can't tell you how much that gold cost, a lot of money. There's nothing like gold, and there's nothing like solid gold, but this beautiful office needed it, it had to be representative, when we took it over, it was dirty, not clean. I immediately changed the chair and had this beautiful desk renovated, brought out by the White House. People that do this, they did a great job, we have a craftsman who's great, but this was not appropriate for the Oval Office, what I took over, and now, if you look at all those paintings, you're allowed to turn back, all of these are great presidents, and they were all in the vaults, they were in vaults for, in some cases, much more than a hundred years, and now they're proudly hanging on the Oval Office walls, and I can't imagine anybody changing it, but they were buried in vaults for over a hundred years, many of them. So it's very exciting, people come in, they really love it, they love what we're doing here, they love what we're doing in D.C., and they love what we're doing, most importantly, in the country, in the world. I'd like to ask Gianni to say a few words, he's the head of the whole thing, he's been there for a long time, probably the most respected man in sports, he's amazing, actually, works very hard, and he's got the biggest event in the world coming right here to the United States, and a little, we did a little for Canada, we did a little for Mexico, we thought, well, see, I'm a good citizen, I said, let them have a little piece, so we gave a little to Canada, see how nice they are, and we gave a little bit to Mexico, and Johnny, please say a few words. JOHNNY: Thank you, thank you, thank you, President, great honor for me to be here with you today, President, Vice President, Excellencies, fantastic to announce what you said, which is the final draw of the FIFA World Cup on the 5th of December, here, in the capital, in the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., at 12 noon sharp, it will be broadcast live all over the world, one billion viewers will watch it, and it will determine, of course, the match schedule, the match schedule which 48 participating teams will play, you said it, 104 matches in one month, 104 Super Bowls, it's not just the biggest, the greatest event, not just a sports event, it's a social event as well, with a lot of emotion, we are uniting the world, Mr. President, uniting the world here in America, and we are very proud of that, and those teams, those national teams who will come here to participate in this draw with their coaches, with their presidents, they will all be proud to be part of writing this history, and that's why we brought as well this, which is the winner's trophy, it is the trophy that the winner of the FIFA World Cup wins, only the FIFA presidents, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it, because it's for winners only, and since you are a winner, of course, you can as well touch it. TRUMP: It's pretty heavy, is the winner trophy. The last one who lifted that is Leo Messi. And here it is in the Oval Office in the White House. JOHNNY: Well, you can keep it in the wall, Governor. It fits well, it's very well on the wall right over there. Let's put it back below the edge. That's a beautiful piece of gold, I would say. So, six billion Euros for the World Cup, six million coming to the matches, 30 billion economic impact, 185,000 jobs. And everything will start here in Washington, D.C. at the Kennedy Center, or the Trump Kennedy Center. It will be called on the 5th of September at noon sharp. Well, how are you going to do that? JOHNNY: Yes, we'll do that at the Kennedy Center. The whole World Cup starts, and everyone will be happy because everyone has qualified for the World Cup, and they didn't yet play a game, so they didn't lose yet the game. TRUMP: Now… By the way, an example. Supposing we had, a week ago, when everybody was being killed and mugged and everything else, despite the phony numbers that were given out, that it was getting better. BRIAN: Oh, the crime was getting worse. How did the other guy come out? BRIAN: He came out with our drink case. TRUMP: That was your drink case? It's worse, it was worse during the Biden administration than anybody's ever imagined possible. And I guarantee you, he wouldn't be here if those numbers continued. And for the border, in three months, zero people. Zero people came through our border in the last 90 days. Last year, we had millions of people coming in. And they came in from the wrong locations. They came in a lot of people that shouldn't be here. So now, when we have this event in December, it's going to be very safe. Johnny, you can walk down the street with your beautiful wife. You can take her to dinner, if you can get a reservation, which I doubt. They're all full of the restaurants. And many new restaurants are going to open, because as you know, many closed. Many restaurants closed, because the crime was so bad. This will be one of the safest places anywhere on earth. So, you know, I really am honored that the National Guard has done such an incredible job working with the police. And we haven't had to bring in the regular military, which we're willing to do. We're going to make our country very safe. And we'll straighten that one out probably next. That'll be our next one after this. And it won't even be tough. And the people in Chicago, Mr. Vice President, are screaming for us to come. They're wearing red hats, just like this one. Please.” I did great with the black vote, as you know. And they want something to happen. So I think Chicago will be our next, and then we'll help with New York, and we're going to help with Boston. I think, really, I think a lot of — and a lot of these people that you see on television, they are — including the people in this audience — they'll say bad things about me, and then they'll say, “Thank God he's here,” because half of them got mugged, and they don't want to get mugged again. But they're — you know, they work for a lot of — they work for stupid people that are radical left, and they're made to do things and say things that they don't want to be saying. But the people right here are all happy because you're not going to be mugged in Washington, D.C., anymore. TRUMP: I just want to say, Johnny's been my friend for a long time. And we will lay out the red carpet. Andrew, you're going to be fantastic. Rick is going to be — everything Rick ever touched is — has always worked out. And he's working with me on the Kennedy Center. And his very good friend was an actor on Broadway for five years, right? And I assume he's helping us a little bit, correct? TRUMP: And, Andrew, you're all excited about it? This is — Would you like to say something? When you think this World Cup is going to be over, our 250th birthday, Mr. President, your leadership, obviously, with FIFA leading the way. TRUMP: I just want to say one thing. Andrew Giuliani — so, his father is Rudy, the greatest mayor in the history of New York, I think by far. He was — he took a ravaged city, a city that was really under siege. Probably most people thought it wasn't going to survive. You go back and tell your father all of the things that have come out over the last couple of months, through Tulsi and through all of the people — Kash, everybody — they've proven your father 100 percent correct. His father was treated so unfairly. Your father has been 100 percent correct. Mr. Vice President, would you like to say something? Thank you, and thanks, Johnny, for being here. We're very thrilled about the World Cup. And we had murder rates just a few weeks ago that rivaled some of the worst third-world cities anywhere, even in very, very poor regions of the world. Why did we allow it to happen? We allowed it to happen because we had broken leadership in Washington, D.C., and, unfortunately, sitting behind the Resolute Desk. What we have shown in just under two weeks of taking law enforcement seriously is that the American people can have their streets back if their leadership is willing to put in the time and the resources. So, Mr. President, you showed in Washington, D.C., that we can have safe streets again. We've just got to have the political willpower to focus on the bad guys and to give the American people back their communities. We are focused on doing that. TRUMP: And that's a really very small percentage. I won't report who you are because you'll end up losing your jobs. I saw pictures of them last night getting off vans and all. And I saw some bad ones running. But they're not running so much anymore. Now, there'll be something happening sometime. Maybe it won't be for a long time. But this was — every night, we'd get reports of people being mugged and kidnapped. There's one woman on television last night. She had a badly busted-up nose. And she said, “Well, I like our streets the way they used to be.” And she thinks it's going to happen, like, by doing nothing. And they said, “What happened to your nose?” She got slugged by a guy walking down the street. Her nose will never be the same, I guarantee you, unless it takes a pretty good turn. She wasn't really for us. But she sort of said, “Well, maybe something has to happen.” Before this happened to me, she got whacked. And I don't think she'll ever be the same. It's not going to happen anymore. But then we're going to beautify the city, too. That's where I was today at Kennedy Center. And the head of Clark is great. He's all over the world, actually. But Washington, I would say, is their home. So you're going to have a fantastic, clean, beautiful place. Literally better than it ever was before. We'll get it done very quickly. And I want to thank Clark, because they're doing a lot of work in a lot of different locations. And, Gianni, did you want to say something? One more thing, because, as you rightly say, you know, with security and beautifying cities and the whole country, we want — people to come and enjoy and have fun and that's why this is not just the most iconic trophy in the world of sport but we start on the 10th of September the sale of tickets for the FIFA World Cup. And we have the first ticket here for the final for you, it's of course row 1 seat 1 is ticket number 4547, and it's for the final in New York New Jersey, so you have your ticket already for the final. All the others 10th of September start getting your tickets. That's beautiful yeah six and a half seven million tickets, fans will enjoy with your security here would be fantastic. TRUMP: You're going to do record business I think. Kristi would you like to say something Kristi: Mr. President, millions of people will come to this country and we'll make sure they get their travel documents their visas that they want to come here and spend their money and enjoy the sporting event. It'll be the largest event in the world and so you're reminding me of something that my dad used to say all the time when I was growing up he would say Kristi, your kids need to look like you respect yourself before anybody's going to respect you, and in this country when people look at our streets when they look at our capital you're bringing respect back to the city. And people will respect our country more because it's safe, it's clean, it's beautiful, and what you're doing is transforming this nation by making sure that our laws are upheld and millions of people are going to come and be able to enjoy it next year. TRUMP: Well our country is respected again and a year ago, we had a dead country. I'm telling you it was a dead country, it was a country that had lost its way. It was a country that was going to fail look even today where they say four trillion dollars in reductions of deficits, and this was totally unexpected. I mean I don't know where they've been the people that do this stuff but it's… I want to thank Kristi for another reason. I said to her two weeks ago I said Kristi, do me a favor. I built the same wall that the Border Patrol asked me to build. It wasn't my first choice, I wanted to do concrete plank and everything nice. You wouldn't have been able to see through it. So I had Border Patrol and they tested everything else, then we gave them steel wall high-grade steel very hard to cut. So we gave inside that is 9,000 pound concrete which is a very tough concrete inside that is rebar a big fat piece of rebar. So you have all different materials that are very hard to cut you need different instruments to cut each one. And I said Kristi, we got to get a coat of paint on it, and I didn't know she was listening. But I said we got to get a coat of paint and it should be black because black makes the steel very hot, it's untouchable, you could fry an egg on it. And I gave it to her along with 30 other things, and she's done such a good job on the border with Tom Homan and the group. Tom Homan's a fantastic guy, what the job he does and the way they work together. So I turn on last night and I see Kristi's painting the wall and it looked beautiful by the way when that paint went over there. If it's black it's going to be very hard to climb that sucker. We used the paint you told me to buy. The two coat will take place in three years from now. But it looks beautiful but thank you very much I didn't know you were listening. We talked about seven different subjects and all of a sudden I see you're out there painting with a lot of painters and everything else but it was it was a beautiful thing to see. Would you like to say something? You've been such a big part of this. SPEAKER: Mr. President, delighted to be here today for this announcement but we're also looking forward to having you at the finals. A lot of people are going to be there. TRUMP: I'd like to thank you all. It's going to be a big event at the Kennedy Center. REPORTER: Do you have time to take part in it? Will you have a part to play on the soccer pitch? I see the money that these soccer players are making. My son is a very good athlete and he's a good soccer player. He's on the tall side for soccer. It's going to be a lot of fun. REPORTER: Many foreigners who want to come to attend the event are concerned about the visa situation. TRUMP: They're going to have a very easy time getting in. Certain countries are going to be very, very easy and other countries are going to be obviously a little bit more difficult. Would you like to explain that question? We have a process set up that we'll be implementing on getting visas approved. It'll happen quickly and we're excited for them to come. I would hope that around the world people know that the United States is excited to bring their family here to enjoy this event. I can relate from the collaboration that we have. TRUMP: I just sent a picture from somebody that wants to be there very badly. I'm going to sign this for him. I was sent one and I thought you would like to see it. It's a man named Vladimir Putin who I believe will be coming depending on what happens. He may be coming and he may not depending on what happens. We have a lot of things happening over the next couple of weeks. But I thought it was a nice picture of him. Can you talk to Vladimir Putin about the fact that yesterday a big U.S. factory was hit in a Russian airstrike in Ukraine? TRUMP: I'm not happy about it. And I'm not happy about anything having to do with that war. I said I settled seven wars and actually if you think about three wars add three more so it would be ten. I thought this would be in the middle of the pack in terms of difficulty. I think over the next two weeks we're going to find out which way it's going to go. And I better be very happy. I just made a very good call with Prime Minister Carney of Canada yesterday morning. Actually Canada is taking away some retaliatory tariffs. TRUMP: He's removing his retaliatory tariffs which I thought was nice. And we're going to have another call soon. We had a very good call. They're getting closer and towards… I like them. I'm fighting for the United States. Canada and Mexico take a lot of our business over the years, over 25, 30 years. They took a lot of our business. And it's basically all coming back into the United States now. And we are working on something. I think he's a good person. And we had a very good talk yesterday. So I think it'll be good. You talked about the search of Ambassador Bolton's home. The Vice President recently did an interview saying that it's about classified documents, but that there's also broad concern about him. TRUMP: Well, I haven't spoken to Pam and the group yet, but I will be. I saw that just like everybody else. I try and stay out of that stuff. And I'm Chief Law Enforcement Officer, believe it or not. But I purposely don't want to really get involved in it. I'm not a fan of John Bolton. I thought he was a sleazebag, actually. And he suffers major Trump derangement syndrome, but so do a lot of people, and they're not being affected by anything we do. I don't know anything about it. But if you believe the news, which I do, I guess his house was raided today. But my house was raided also for Mar-a-Lago. They went through everything they could, including my young son's room and my wife's area. They went through her drawers, as the expression goes. They went through everything you can imagine. And she looked, and she said, “ooh, this wasn't the way that she had it.” So I know the feeling. REPORTER: Mr. President, how long will you give Putin? We're going to figure it out. TRUMP: Look, it takes two to tango. I wanted to have a meeting with those two. I could have been at the meeting, but I know a lot of people think that nothing's going to come out of that meeting. In the meantime, people continue to die. I solved seven of them where they were in wars for 31, 35, and 37 years. We had three of them that were for more than 30 years, and I got them solved. And we solved one that could have been a nuclear war with India and Pakistan. That was getting ready to be a nuclear war. And this one, I thought we would have had it done by now, but it's more difficult. REPORTER: I've got two questions for you, one on FIFA, the other one on D.C. You talk about the economic impact that people will have in these cities, and what's your message to the mayors to get their cities prepared, not only for the beautification process, but also the safety aspect? TRUMP: Well, Los Angeles is an example. We have a mayor there that can't even get permits to the people that lost their houses. Within 20 days, every single permit was there for the people to build their houses. But people are writing us, and they're saying they won't give us… The mayor is incompetent. He's an incompetent guy with a good line of bullshit. And he doesn't get the job done. And frankly, those people want to build their houses. Some of them could have been built already. But think of it, the federal government that has the most complex part… It's the most complex environmental thing to do. We got it… Everybody had it within 30 days. And they're not even close to getting their permits. And now they're talking about taking some of those sites and building low-income housing on them. And I'm all for low-income housing. I built a lot of low-income housing. I know every program that there is in the government. I used every one of them. I know more about low-income housing than probably almost anybody. But you don't build it in Pacific Palisades. You don't build it there. And you don't build it in the other areas that burned down. REPORTER: My second question is on crime prevention. Would you be open to expanding the national concealed carry to apply to D.C. like it does in other states like Texas? Well, they have it in some states, and they feel strongly about it. As you know, I'm in favor of it. I'm a Second Amendment person, very simply. Especially like in Washington, you walk down the street, a guy comes up and slugs you, and he's got a pistol in his hand. You could be in great shape. You could be a powerful person. Or you could be a guy that weighs 100 pounds with a gun in your hand. So I'm a Second Amendment person all the way. REPORTER: President Trump said this morning that you're working with Congress to get $2 billion to help clean up D.C. Have you had any conversations with Mike Johnson and John Thune about where they're going to get that money from? REPORTER: You said this morning that you're going to get $2 billion from Congress to help clean up D.C. I've spoken to John Thune, the Senate House. It's going to be not a lot of money. I wouldn't even know where to spend the number that you mentioned. In one way, it's the easiest. The violence was more than any other city in the country, actually, by far. It may have been more than any other city in the world, if you could think. And, you know, we looked at some of the worst cities in the world. And that's why it angers me to see the mayor saying about how they have it on this side. Yeah, we have no problem getting that money. That money will come out of Congress. I think it will be even bipartisan. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I don't know if there is a deadline, either deadline, because if I declare a national emergency, which this was, that ends the deadline. So, I mean, I keep seeing about a 30-day deadline of which we have 22 days left or something. But if I think we're in great shape here, that's one thing. But if I don't, I'm going to just say it's a national emergency. If people are not going to want to have the troops, in 30 days, you know, it's one thing to get them out. It's another thing to keep them out for a long period of time. You can't bop people over the head. And a lot of those people are in courts right now, going to court. So that's going to take more than 30 days. I think I'll know the attitude of Russia and, frankly, of Ukraine. REPORTER: What are the two ways you can go at the end of two weeks, then? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, then I'm going to make a decision as to what we do. And it's going to be a very important decision. Look, I would have never been in this war if I were president. You would have had this war. It was never going to happen. This was caused by stupid people that fought. Because for four years, it was never even a subject. And you see his picture right here. It was nice that he said, but Vladimir knew very strongly. We wouldn't have stood for it. A hundred percent wouldn't have happened. And now they're losing from five to seven young kids. You're a parent and your son is leaving. He wants to be a soldier. First week, he has his head blown off. And he's no different than you people, me. And it doesn't matter where. And they were fighting for 31 years. People were getting their heads chopped off. They came to the White House and we signed an agreement. People can't believe we got it done. People thought it would be just the opposite. Hillary Clinton said, “Oh, he'll get us into a war.” No, I'm getting everybody else out of wars. REPORTER: Do you think it's a real possibility then that he'd do nothing if Putin doesn't come to the table for a ceasefire? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'll see who's fault it is. If there are reasons why, I'll understand that. We're going to see whether or not they have a meeting. And if they don't, why didn't they have a meeting? Because I told them to have a meeting. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'm in support of keeping it open. People shouldn't be hurt, but I'm in support of keeping it totally open. You've got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don't deserve to be people, because he knew everybody in Palm Beach. I don't know anything about that, but I have said to Pam and everybody else, give them everything you can give them, because it's a Democrat hoax. The whole Epstein thing is a Democrat hoax. So we had the greatest six months, seven months in the history of the presidency, and the Democrats don't know what to do, so they keep bringing up that stuff. Bill Clinton was on his plane and went to the island supposedly 28 times. I don't want to bring that up, frankly. You have Larry whatever his name is, Summers, the head of Harvard, who was Jeffrey Epstein's best friend. But I don't want to hurt Larry Summers, but he was best friends with Jeffrey Epstein. No, this is a Democratic hoax to try and get the significance of what we've done over the past seven months. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. They say it's number one in history, what we've done, including stopping seven wars. And now you look at the stock market today, And this market was going to crash. If Joe Biden or Kamala were president, this market, we would have had a crash like in 1929. You're not going to have that. You know, I had the strongest economy in the history of our country. And despite COVID, we have the strongest economy in the history of our country. And we're going to blow it away this time. I was always good at making a lot of money. And whether it was for myself or whether I like doing it this way better. Our country has been ripped off by friend and foe, nations all over the world, ripped off. And they're not ripping us off. We just signed a deal with the European Union. They're paying us essentially $950 billion, like a signing fee. They're going to buy $750 billion worth of energy. They weren't buying much of our energy there. And they're very smart in doing it. And as you know, Ursula was here a couple of days ago, having to do with the people, the leaders that we had agreed. People said they'd never seen anything like it. Well, we had the leaders of Europe right here in the Oval Office. But people aren't ripping us anymore. REPORTER: Mr. President, I have two questions. Yeah, I met a man who was a very nice man, and I called for his removal because I saw something by a man named Tom Cotton, a senator from Arkansas. I'm a supporter of his too. And he wrote a pretty nasty story about the head of Intel. And I said, well, if that's right, he should resign. I thought he was very good. I thought he was somewhat a victim. But, you know, nobody's a total victim, I guess. And I said, “You know what? I think the United States should be given 10% of Intel.” And he said, “I would consider that.” I said, “Well, I'd like you to do that because Intel has been left behind,” as you know, compared to Jensen and some of our friends, NVIDIA, some of the people and the people in… Because Intel should have never been… Intel was the biggest, most powerful chip company in the world. And they started going to foreign countries, in particular Taiwan. And if we had a president that would have said, “OK, you can go to Taiwan, but we're going to put a 100% tariff or 200% or 300% or 500% tariff. Anybody that sells into the United States has to pay.” They wouldn't have left. So, in the meantime, we have people that were, in some cases, good politicians that weren't good on trade. I loved that man, but he was not good on trade. He allowed the car industry to be taken out of this country. We lost 50% of our car industry. But if somebody would have said that with Intel, we'd be a giant right now. Now, with that, they've had some bad management over the years and they got lost. And I said, “I think you should pay us 10% of your company” and they said, “Yes,” that's about 10 billion dollars. This comes to the United States of America. And I said, “I think it would be good having the United States as your partner.” He agreed and they've agreed to do it. And I think it's a great deal for them. And I think it's a great deal. He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us 10 billion dollars for the United States. So we picked up 10 billion and we do a lot of deals like that. If somebody has like we have restrictive covenants with Jensen, we have it's NVIDIA. Nothing to do with losing our powers or military or anything because that I wouldn't do. But there are things you can do that don't affect us that actually help us. And if we're going to give somebody a free out a restricted covenant, we have a strong restrictive covenant on certain industries. And I will absolutely give somebody a opening or a restrict to do a lot of business, which is good for us, as long as it doesn't hurt us in a security or military way. Then they'll come back and they'll say, “I'd love to be able to build over here, but I'm not allowed to because you have me covered. You have me restricted.” I said, “I'll let you build over there, but pay me a lot of money.” No different. But the country never did it because the country was run by foolish people. REPORTER: You said Chicago might be bad. Have there been concrete steps that the administration has taken to do that? Or what other cities have done that? TRUMP: I haven't spoken to them. I haven't spoken to them. Chicago was our greatest city, actually. Bob Tisch, a great friend of mine, passed away. He used to own the Giants, very successful Lowe's. He said Chicago and San Francisco, the two greatest cities in the world. Now you look at what the Democrats have done to San Francisco. I own a big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco. We can clean that up, too. We'll clean that one up, too. If everything works out, and we've already had calls from other cities, quiet calls. Calls from Democrats, “We'd love you to come here,” because they've lost control of themselves. I'm not going to say it, because I don't want them to lose their elections. “We'd love you to come here. This will straighten out the problem.” REPORTER: In Israel, the families of hostages are opposed to the reoccupying of Gaza. TRUMP: Well, not all of them. And you have to understand, I'm the one that got all of the hostages out. You got a lot of people out. But if it wasn't for me, you would have all these hostages would most likely be dead right now, every one of them. So they all come up here. What they had to go through is incredible. So now they have 20, but the 20 is actually probably not 20, because a couple maybe aren't around any longer. No, I don't like it anymore. I said, you know, when you get down to 20, they're not going to make deals anymore, and they didn't. And then I put out a statement, as you know, that was a tough statement, go in and get them. And they said, “We'll give you 10, we'll give you 10.” I don't know what Israel's doing, but they were willing now immediately to give us another 10. I actually think they're safer in many ways if you went in and you really went in fast and you did it. And people can't forget October 7th, remember that. I won the Arab vote in Michigan. I did so great with the Arab vote, remember? I wouldn't say the candidate was the greatest, but I would have won against anybody. But we have to do things properly. And, you know, I'm very proud to say I got the hostages out. And now we have that final little group of people. And Hamas knows that if they give them, that's probably the end of their lives. So it's not easy to get. But I got them out and did a good job. Well, we called him too late for a reason. He should have caught him a year ago. You know, we have a stock market that's up a thousand points today. But it's up a thousand points when I came in here. We have a country that markets the hottest it's ever been. The country is better than it's ever been. TRUMP: We have a military that I rebuilt largely in my first term. We had a great, successful first term, but this is going to be even better. We gave a lot of it away to Afghanistan, but relatively small compared to the overall. But I think it was the most embarrassing day and period in the history of our country that they allowed those 13 wonderful people. But it's really hundreds of people were killed. And they don't talk about the 48 that was so severely wounded with no legs, no arms. Nobody ever mentions them except me. Frankly, if that didn't happen, I really believe that you might not have had the problem with Russia. I think Putin was sitting there watching these stupid people running our country and said, this is the time to invade. You know, this is the time. And then Biden made the statement, “Well, he can do a small incursion.” When he said that, it was off to the races, right? I was surprised he knew the word incursion. I didn't think he had that good of a vocabulary. TRUMP: I want to thank everybody. It's very important to me and to everybody up here, the World Cup. And Johnny has been so incredible. I mean, he's really a great leader. You don't have to come.” No, he said, “I'll come. I'll come.” And he flew all night long to be here and listen to this about how great we're doing in D.C. And this will be your most successful World Cup ever. REPORTER: Can he win it, Mr. President? I watched some of those teams go. Did they go down that field? But let me ask you, what chance does America have of winning? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Well, the home team always has a good chance to win. TRUMP: Of course you have a chance. REPORTER: It will barely go into the games, Mr. President? TRUMP: I'd love to have him. Maybe we could make him a goalie. Goalies are very tall now, right? Well, he'd be a perfect goalie. At his height, he'll be a great goalie. So we'll put him with the Americans. REPORTER: No, but do the Americans have a chance of, like, getting into the quarterfinal? They will all feel energized about that. The talent is really great when you watch these things. I went to the game two weeks ago, and it was a big upset. But you look at these people, the way they pass it. I think the American team is going to do well. Our mission is to provide the most accurate transcripts of videos and audios online.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump announced Friday that the draw for the 2026 men's World Cup will be held on 5 December at Washington's Kennedy Center – and suggested he may even take part himself. “It's the biggest, probably the biggest event in sports,” said Trump, 79, wearing a red hat reading: Trump Was Right About Everything. Infantino likened the month-long tournament to “104 Super Bowls”, prompting Trump to add: “Some of them are bigger than Super Bowls, actually.” The tournament begins on 11 June at Mexico City's Azteca Stadium and ends on 19 July at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Washington is not among the 16 host cities, but Trump has turned the Kennedy Center into his personal fiefdom, installing himself as chair, replacing its board with loyalists and floating the name “Trump-Kennedy Center”. The president fumbled momentarily before placing it on his desk. “Can I keep it?” Infantino later presented him with a giant ticket marked Row 1, Seat 1 for the final. Asked if he would draw the team names himself, Trump smiled and deferred to Infantino. “It's a very interesting proposal,” the Fifa chief replied. Trump went further, suggesting Russian president Vladimir Putin “wants to be there very badly” for the finals, though “it may depend on the outcome of peace efforts in Ukraine.” The Kennedy Center, now undergoing a $257m renovation, will double as Fifa's new US headquarters. Trump has called it a showpiece for America's 250th anniversary celebrations next year. Fifa has also expanded its US presence, opening offices in Miami and New York's Trump Tower.</p>
