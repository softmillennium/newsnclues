                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. immigration officials have notified Kilmar Abrego Garcia of their intent to deport him to Uganda, his attorneys said in a Saturday filing that accuses the government of pressuring Abrego Garcia to accept a plea deal. The move comes after Abrego Garcia, who in March was wrongfully deported to an infamous prison in El Salvador, was released from a jail near Nashville, Tennessee on Friday. In the new filing, Abrego Garcia's lawyers say that the Trump administration offered on Thursday to deport him to Costa Rica, after serving any sentence imposed by the court, if he agreed to remain in jail until Monday and plead guilty to both counts in the criminal indictment. His attorneys write that "within minutes of his release" on Friday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement representative informed them that "the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda," ordering him to report to ICE's office in Baltimore on Monday morning. "On Friday evening, the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning—precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office—to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever," his attorneys say. "There can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat," Abrego Garcia's lawyers write. His attorneys say in the filing that the administration's threat of deportation to Uganda supports their motion to dismiss the smuggling charges on account of vindictive and selective prosecution. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the new filing. Abrego Garcia was detained by ICE on March 12 and deported to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador three days later in what the Trump administration has since called an "administrative error." A U.S. judge in 2019 barred Abrego Garcia from being deported to El Salvador because of concerns that he would be persecuted there. Abrego Garcia's case has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration's strict immigration playbook. The administration has alleged that Abrego Garcia has ties to the notorious MS-13 gang, an accusation that he denies. A trial on the federal human smuggling charges is scheduled for January.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. The great wealth transfer is leading to a great real estate transfer, with up to $25 trillion in real estate owned by older generations that could get passed down — and fought over — in their families. According to Cerulli Associates, $105 trillion is expected to be passed down by baby boomers and older generations by 2048. Real estate, including primary and vacation homes, as well as investment properties, is expected to be a large component. The silent generation and baby boomers own nearly $25 trillion in real estate combined, according to the Federal Reserve. Wealth advisors say handing down real estate is increasingly filled with both financial and emotional pitfalls for families, ranging from taxes and maintenance costs to disputes over ownership and usage. "Some people want to retain the house and other children don't," said BNY Wealth's Jere Doyle. "I can tell you, as a practical matter, there's going to be fights. You're not going to have the perfect situation." But lawyers and wealth planners say there are measures families can take to more effectively pass down real estate to minimize taxes, costs and family battles. Here are five secrets to successful real estate inheritances, whether it's an apartment on Park Avenue, a beach house on the Vineyard or a ranch in Montana. Passing down vacation homes is the most fraught, said Elisa Rizzo of J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "That vacation home, often for our families that are very mobile, becomes the centering place," said Rizzo, head of family office advisory at JP Morgan. "The vacation homes are where people go, and they make really special memories with one another, whether it's a ski house up in Vermont or a vacation home on Nantucket." Doyle advises against gifting long-held real estate before you die. "If you give during your lifetime, the kids take your cost basis," said Doyle, senior estate planning strategist for BNY Wealth. There are ways to minimize the tax burden, such as using a qualified personal residence trust. These legal maneuvers protect assets in several ways. For instance, if a vacation home is rented and a tenant slips and falls, the heirs are not held personally liable for any damages. "Your other assets, stocks, bonds, are not subject to any creditors' claims," Doyle said. It also shields heirs from the liabilities of their siblings, according to Dan Griffith, director of wealth strategy at Huntington Private Bank. You can also save on transfer taxes by gifting interest in an LLC that owns the property rather than putting heirs' names on the deed, Griffith said. Since these fractional interests are illiquid, parents can claim a discount on the taxable value. The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Parents can put rules in place with an operating agreement for the LLC. Clients can use the document to make sure the home doesn't end up in the hands of their children's spouses, which is a common concern, according to Northern Trust's Laura Mandel. Parents can restrict an LLC interest from transferring to surviving or former spouses of their children. With a well-drawn trust, it would be difficult for the spouse to contest it in court, Mandel said. Parents can also use the document to guide how the property is used, such as laying out how many holiday weekends each child gets, who has the right to redecorate or whether the home can be rented out or used for weddings. Leaving these issues unaddressed can cause fights among siblings. Mandel recalled a set of four siblings with a large ranch out west that they rented out frequently. Money is the most common trigger for family feuds, Griffith said. An inherited home can quickly become a financial burden unless the parents also set aside cash to pay for the upkeep. "What ends up inevitably happening there is that one person pays the bills, and then enormous resentment grows, because either that person has to ask their siblings or cousins for money and sometimes those people don't pay," he said. Doyle recommends that parents use liquid assets like marketable securities or take out a life insurance policy in order to endow the trust. This outlay makes it possible for siblings to hold onto the home even if they can't afford to share the expenses. "In a lot of cases, you may have some kids that can afford to pay the maintenance expenses, and others can't, so how do you treat them equally?" However, the operating agreement should still include a contingency plan for dividing expenses if the trust runs dry. However, even if heirs initially agree to, they may change their minds later. Perhaps they grow tired of sharing a home with their cousins or a death in the family changes the equation, she said. It's important to plan for the likelihood that some or all of the heirs will want to cash out. Doyle suggests creating buyout provisions that allow heirs to buy their siblings' LLC interest even if they don't have the liquidity, such as taking out a promissory note. "What you've got to build into any plan is an understanding that people's circumstances and situations can and will definitely change," he said. This can be hard for parents to reconcile, but keeping heirs' hands tied defeats the purpose of a vacation home, Griffith said. "If your grandchildren don't have any ties to this place, no one lives here, no one grew up here, nobody cares, then do you really care if they sell the place?" "If somebody else who really does care about it gets to enjoy it, is that such a bad thing?" Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As fears of a slowing economy lurk in the background, some businesses are taking notice and bringing back so-called recession specials. Consider this Grub Street article from 2008 slugged "Recession Specials: Your Definitive Guide." Or this 2009 story from The New York Times, which details the mealtime recession specials restaurants across New York offered as an act of survival. Recession fears were heating up this spring as President Donald Trump rolled out a slate of tariffs in early April. The term "recession indicator" entered the vernacular of social media users as a tongue-in-cheek way of gauging a potential economic slowdown. Businesses are now getting in on the joke as well. For instance, Brooklyn, New York coffee shop Clever Blend advertises a $6 gelato and espresso "recession special." Wicked Willy's, a bar in Manhattan, got on board by offering a "Recession Pop Party" earlier this month, with one caption on an Instagram post declaring: "The recession is BACK! Get ready to dance and party all night long!" "From The Fame to Animal, Circus to Rated R, we're serving economic anxiety with a side of electro-pop, bloghaus, and auto-tuned glam," an Instagram caption for the event read. "Dress like rent's due and you're dancing through it." But the trend doesn't just stop in New York. Super Duper, a burger chain with 18 locations across the San Francisco Bay Area, tapped in earlier this year with its own "Recession Burger," a seasonal special introduced in the summer. The idea for the burger's name didn't necessarily come from a desire to cash in on the buzzword, said Ed Onas, Super Duper's vice president of operations. Instead, he said, the moniker was derived from the Depression-era origins of the Oklahoma-style smash burger, which aimed to stretch ground beef by adding lots of sliced onions. But once Super Duper established the burger's name, the chain decided to offer a discounted "Recession Combo" for $10. "That's kind of where the name of the burger plays in … And we figured, we're calling it the 'Recession Combo,' why don't we just offer a deal that makes it a really good value for our guests?" "Inflation has kind of been going on, and we figured it's a nice offer for a short amount of time for our guests." This extra-value combo meal was an exception for Super Duper, which normally doesn't offer such deals. We didn't realize that it was going to get as much attention as it did," Onas said. "We were happy, and our guests were happy, and at the end of the day, that's what it's all about." As a testament to the burger's overwhelming success, Onas told CNBC that Super Duper will be adding it onto its menu as a permanent fixture going forward. These small businesses getting in on the trend could be a broader reaction to waning consumer confidence. Consider that the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index came in at 58.6 in August, down from a reading of 61.7 in July and reflecting a 13.7% change on a year-over-year basis. "What's very clear from the consumer sentiment data is that consumers are broadly bracing for a slowdown in the economy and a deterioration — not just with inflation, expecting inflation to get worse — but they're also expecting businesses conditions to deteriorate," she said. And what you're seeing with these businesses could be a reaction to that." A lack of consumer confidence — and trust in income reliability — will ultimately lead to a pullback in spending, Hsu added. "Young people are feeling just as bad about the economy as older folks, and in some months they feel even worse than older folks," she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India's foreign minister said on Saturday that trade negotiations with Washington are continuing but there are lines that New Delhi needs to defend, just days before hefty additional U.S. tariffs are due to hit. Indian goods face additional U.S. tariffs of up to 50%, among the highest imposed by Washington, due to its increased purchases of Russian oil. A 25% tariff has already come into effect, while the remaining 25% is set to be enforced from August 27. A planned visit by U.S. trade negotiators to New Delhi from August 25-29 has been called off, dashing hopes that the levies may be lowered or postponed. "We have some redlines in the negotiations, to be maintained and defended," Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said at an Economic Times forum event in New Delhi, singling out the interests of the country's farmers and small producers. India-U.S. trade talks collapsed earlier this year due to India not agreeing to open its vast agricultural and dairy sectors. Analysts at Capital Economics said on Friday that if the full U.S. tariffs come into force and stick, the hit to India's economic growth would be 0.8 percentage points both this year and next. "The longer-term harm could be even greater as a high tariff could puncture India's appeal as a global manufacturing hub." The Indian minister described U.S. President Donald Trump's policy announcements as "unusual". "We have not had a U.S. president who conducts his foreign policy so publicly as the current one and (it) is a departure from the traditional way of conducting business with the world," Jaishankar said. He also said Washington's concern over India's Russian oil purchases was not being applied to other major buyers such as China and European Union. "If the argument is oil, then there are (other) big buyers. If argument is who is trading more (with Russia), than there are bigger traders," he said. The minister also said India's purchases of Russian oil had not been raised in earlier trade talks with the U.S. before the public announcement of tariffs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spain's booming economy is outpacing its European neighbors as tourism, foreign investment and immigration helps fuel growth. The southern European country is still leading growth in the euro zone with annual gross domestic product forecasted to rise 2.5% this year, while the economies of France, Germany and Italy are respectively forecast to expand 0.6%, 0% and 0.7%. Spain's GDP surpassed expectations in the second quarter, growing 0.7%, above a Reuters forecast of 0.6%. "For the second year in a row, we will be the advanced economy number one in terms of GDP growth," Spain's Finance Minister Carlos Cuerpo told CNBC in April. "Spain is a great outlier now in terms of growth. It's also a great place to invest," he added. The success of Spain's economy relies on high consumption and investment, as well as tourism, Next Generation European funds, and immigration. We're exporting more in terms of services to firms like IT, accountability services, financial services, than we're exporting in terms of tourism — 100 billion euros [$116.8 billion] with respect to 94.95 billion [euros in tourism]. "What is going to happen with tariffs and international trade, especially in an economy like Spain, where exports of goods have increased considerably over the last 15 years?" A third source is this low investment rates. Still, tourism in Spain represents around 12% of the country's GDP, as it benefits from the pandemic rebound, and cheaper prices compared to other Western European nations. Last year in June, protesters in Barcelona were seen spraying travellers with water guns and shouting "tourists go home." Job creation is also supported by high immigration. While other European countries are closing their borders, Spain is planning to welcome nearly a million migrants over the next three years, through work visa schemes and the granting of residence permits to undocumented workers. "90% of the increase in the labour force since 2021 comes from immigration," BBVA Research's Chief Economist Miguel Cardoso told CNBC. "This is allowing the service sector to expand. Las year, most people migrating to Spain came from Colombia, Venezuela and Morocco. "Latin American economies, some of them are not doing relatively well, so there is this push factor. There is also the fact that immigration to the United States has become more difficult, and therefore people are turning around and seeing alternatives," added Cardoso. Spain's economy has also been bolstered by the European Union's Next Generation EU funds which has made 163 billion euros available to Spain, through grants and loans. Spain's Cuerpo told CNBC that 70% of the grants — 55 billion euros — have already been dispersed. "This was a program that was designed in part to try to help with the recovery after the pandemic," said Cardoso. "So the government prioritized investment projects that they already had a plan for, and therefore they are having a relatively low multiplying effect within the economy." Nonetheless, the Spanish government aims to use these funds in sectors such as non-tourism services exports, including renewables. Since investing in green energy in the 2000s, Spain has benefited from low energy costs and has seen less impact from the European energy crisis that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Low production costs are an attractive criterion for companies, particularly foreign investors, who also supply the sector. Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. It's a burgeoning renewable energy source that can lead to lower electricity costs. "Spain is probably the location in Europe where the most PV has been done," Arctech's EU and NA Markets General Manager Pedro Magalhaes told CNBC. The company now boasts 17 branches outside China, and is planning to expand in Eastern Europe, as well as plans to diversify into storage solutions. We use the port of Valencia to import and distribute to many locations in Europe," Magalhaes added. Like Arctech, many foreign companies are planning to take advantage of the country's low energy costs. Auto giant Stellantis teamed up with battery manufacturer CATL in late 2024, announcing plans to build a $4.3 billion lithium iron phosphate battery plant in Zaragoza, northeastern Spain. "When you look at where does that investment come from, the largest investor in Spain is U.S.," said Cuerpo. "But we're also attracting investment from other parts of the world, including China, on specific sectors related to renewables, to sustainable mobility as well, and this is of course, always part of our economic security agenda."

"In principle, given that software companies like Microsoft do not themselves manufacture any physical hardware, it should be possible to simulate them entirely with AI." Brent Mayo, an engineer working for xAI, retweeted Musk's post. Grok, Musk's AI, responded to comments on X and said that AI could theoretically replicate Microsoft's "entire operations" from coding to management, adding that the company is now hiring. Documents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office also show that a mark for "macrohard" was filed on August 1 by xAI. Macrohard would be added to Musk's long lineup of ventures, which he either partially owns or operates. The creation of Macrohard also comes as Musk pushes further into AI and robotics, including encouraging Tesla to invest in xAI. In a 2024 earnings call, Musk said that those thinking of Tesla merely as an auto company are holding "the wrong framework," and called Tesla an "AI robotics company." Musk has also been placing increasing emphasis on projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots.</p>
