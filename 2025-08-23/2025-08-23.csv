            As the Trump administration escalates its deployment of troops in the nation's capital and vows similar moves elsewhere, leaders of largely Democratic cities across the country are pushing back.
    


            From Boston to Los Angeles, President Donald Trump's portrayal of the District of Columbia as a lawless wasteland to justify his military and law enforcement incursion is viewed as an opening salvo in a bid to undermine the autonomy of America's biggest cities. On Friday, Trump promised to target Chicago next, then New York.
    


            Many big city mayors, however, remain defiant, saying: Not so fast, Mr. President.
    


            “Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures,” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat, said Tuesday, after Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to prosecute local officials whose cities did not comply with the White House's immigration crackdown. “Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law.”
    


            Bondi has made it clear the federal takeover in DC goes hand-in-hand with the administration's hard-line immigration enforcement, using control over law enforcement in the district as a way to try to put an end to the city's laws that protect undocumented migrants. The federal government could slash funding to cities that don't comply and send in law enforcement as it has done in Los Angeles and DC, Bondi has said.
    


Trump says Chicago next up for federal crime crackdown



            “Your attacks all come back to a common aim: The Trump Administration seeks to divide, isolate, and intimidate our cities, and make Americans fearful of one another,”  Wu said.
    


            On August 11, Trump announced the decision to declare a crime emergency and federalize DC's police force, saying his administration was “going to restore the city back to the gleaming capital that everybody wants it to be.” Washington's mayor and police chief were caught off guard, learning about the takeover for the first time as they watched Trump announce it live. Violent crime in the nation's capital is at its lowest levels in decades, according to city officials.
    


            DC Mayor Muriel Bowser called the president's actions an “authoritarian push.”
    


            The Home Rule Act of 1973 allows the president to take control of DC's police for 48 hours if he “determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist,” which requires the department's use for federal purposes.
    


            The president can retain control of the department for a longer period if he notifies the chairs and ranking members of the congressional committees that handle legislative matters pertaining to DC. Trump indicated he intends to do. Any request of control over the city's police department for more than 30 days must be passed into law.
    


            In other states, however, governors control guard troops. During emergencies the president can federalize guard troops, as Trump did in Los Angeles in June, a move the state of California has challenged in federal court.
    


            “You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is,” Trump said during the announcement. “We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem. And then you have, of course, Baltimore and Oakland.”
    


            He repeated that message on Thursday, when he promoted his anti-crime initiative at a US Park Police facility in DC. He brought pizza and hamburgers to law enforcement officers who greeted him.
    


            “We're going to make it safe, and we're going to then go on to other places, but we're going to stay here for a while,” he said to dozens of law enforcement agents and National Guard members gathered outside the facility to hear him speak.
    


            Speaking from the Oval Office on Friday, Trump vowed to “straighten” out Chicago next and “then we'll help New York.”
    


            “They're wearing red hats, African American ladies, beautiful ladies, are saying, ‘Please, President Trump, come to Chicago,'” the president said.
    


            And seeming to conflate his deployment of troops in DC with his takeover of the city's police force, Trump on Friday said he can keep the National Guard in the nation's capital “as long as I want” if he declares a national emergency.
    


            In Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson in a statement Friday said the city had received no formal communication from the White House concerning any deployments there. Johnson expressed “grave concerns” over an “unlawful deployment,” calling Trump's approach “uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound.”
    


            Johnson had earlier said the city “remains in regular communication” with fellow Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker about the federal government's actions, according to the mayor's office. Johnson and other US mayors have called on the Trump administration to restore more than $800 million in violence and crime prevention grants the DOJ has withheld to force states into cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts.
    


Trump has suggested a nationwide crime crackdown. Here's what he can do outside of DC



            “These anti-violence programs have a direct impact on our work to reduce crime and violence in Chicago. Sending in the National Guard could destabilize our public safety efforts and would be counterproductive to rebuilding trust between residents and law enforcement,” Johnson's office said in a statement. Chicago police said Friday homicides are down 31% this year and shootings 36%.
    


            Johnson accused Trump of “stoking fear and division while criminalizing poverty.”
    


            In response to the president's pledge to target Chicago, Pritzker in a statement said Trump is “playing a game and creating a spectacle.”
    


            “As Donald Trump attempts to create chaos that distracts from his problems, we will call it out for what it is,” Pritzker said. “Trump and Republicans are trying to distract from the pain they are causing working families – from tariffs raising the prices of everyday goods to stripping away healthcare and food from millions of Americans.”
    


            In Los Angeles, Trump defied Mayor Karen Bass by deploying National Guard troops and Marines to the city in June to protect federal buildings during protests against the administration's immigration policies. In a democratic society, she said, law enforcement problems should never need military solutions.



            “I believed then, as I believe now, that Los Angeles was a test case. I think DC is a test case as well,” Bass told CNN, warning that Trump's incursion into the capital could be a precursor for other illegal power grabs.
    


            “The president (can) say, ‘Well we can take over your city whenever we want and I am the commander in chief and I can use the troops whenever we want.' I think that is an abuse of our troops, and I think it is an overreach of presidential powers.”
    


            Trump signed a presidential memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles in June to disperse the protests in response to immigration raids. Law enforcement in riot gear deployed tear gas and flash bangs to disperse crowds in the Los Angeles area over two days. Trump administration officials called the protesters “lawless rioters.”
    


            Bass' office in a statement said crime is down in the city and homelessness has dropped two consecutive years. Los Angeles officials said last month the city is on pace for the lowest homicide total in 60 years.
    


            “The latest actions in LA and Washington DC seem to be for the purpose of testing state and cities' willingness to accept the federal government taking power away from local leaders when there is simply no need,” the mayor's statement said.
    


            “I'm going to look at New York in a little while,” Trump said the day he took federal control of DC's police force and mobilized National Guard troops.
    


            The warning comes as New York City is on track this year to record the lowest number of shootings and murders in its recorded history.
    


            “We don't need anyone to come in and take over our law enforcement apparatus. We have the finest police department on the globe,” Mayor Eric Adams told reporters one day after Trump's DC announcement. “We got this under control.”
    


            Still, authorities are preparing for the possibility of a federal takeover – ensuring civil disturbances are quickly and effectively handled to show there is no need for added enforcement, a state official told CNN this week.
    


DC residents feel less safe after Trump takeover: poll



            Should a takeover attempt happen, state officials would be in communication with the National Guard but working to challenge the action in court, according to the official, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the matter.
    


            State officials have already spoken about the possibility of a deployment with the local head of the National Guard in New York, the official said. While the National Guard must follow orders from Washington, the official said, they must also balance the limit of their capabilities since guardsmen are not trained as police officers.
    


            About 1,000 guard members are already deployed on missions in New York state, including added security at transit hubs, according to the official. Discussions among state officials began after ICE demonstrations became heated in Los Angeles, the official said.
    


            In Baltimore, about 40 miles north of DC, Mayor Brandon Scott told CNN the city has had the fewest homicides in 50 years. He said it's “notable” that the cities Trump mentioned all have Black mayors and historic drops in violent crime.
    


            “What we know about this administration is that we have to be ready for anything,” Scott's office said in a statement. “We can't let the chaos coming from Washington distract us from the critically important work happening here in Baltimore and in cities across the country that is saving lives and reducing crime.”
    


            At the same time, Trump's DOJ has cut about $1.2 million from community violence intervention programs, according to the statement.
    


            “Our federal law enforcement partners have real jobs to do — in partnership with state and local leaders — to investigate and prevent crime,” the statement added. 



            “The President doesn't care about stopping crime. He's slashing funding for organizations that are working to prevent crime in communities nationwide — yet he's claiming the Black mayors of DC, Baltimore, Chicago, and Oakland are the problem. It's all a distraction from his own failures: the chaos of the economy, the Epstein files, and America's falling standing in the world.”
    


            In Oakland, Mayor Barbara Lee dismissed Trump's characterization of the city as “wrong and not grounded in facts, but in fearmongering.”
    


            “This is not leadership — it's an attempt to score cheap political points by tearing down communities he doesn't understand,” she said in a statement, CNN affiliate KRON-TV reported.
    


            Earlier this month, the Oakland Police Department reported that violent crime was down 29% this year through June 30. Homicides dropped 21%, rapes decreased 24% and robberies declined 41%.
    


            In Philadelphia, another largely Democratic city whose violent crime has decreased substantially since post-pandemic peaks, District Attorney Larry Krasner held his own press conference in a West Philadelphia church one day after Trump's announcement.
    


            “The only emergency I can think of for public safety is what we call D.J.T.,” the progressive prosecutor said, flanked by spiritual leaders. “Donald J. Trump is the emergency right now in big cities in America.”
    


            Krasner told CNN the current administration would have no legal grounds to federalize the Philadelphia Police Department, and there is no reason to justify sending in the National Guard.

            “He may think he's gonna try it in other places, but the fact is legally he has much less of a right to do any of this in other cities, and he better not try it in Philly,” Krasner told CNN.
    


            Homicides, shootings, and armed robberies are down 16%, 19%, and 20%, respectively, in Philadelphia in 2025 compared to the same period last year – and down even more compared to 2021 highs, according to police department data.
    


            “We have seen a record drop in crime in urban America … Philadelphia actually leads the nation in the biggest reduction in violent crime today versus where we were a few years ago,” Congressman Brendan Boyle, who represents Philadelphia, told CNN.
    


            “The timing doesn't make any sense in this respect,” said the Democratic representative when asked if he's worried about Trump's warning.
    


            Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker's office declined to comment to CNN on the ongoing federal takeover in DC or any hypothetical actions in Philly.

            In response to Trump's actions in DC, Democratic state Sen. Art Haywood, who represents part of Philadelphia, released a memo announcing the “Protecting PA Police Act.”
    


            Haywood's office explained the intent of the legislation would be to explicitly prevent any federal takeover of “1,000 municipal police departments (or) our state police.”
    


            Further details or a draft of the proposed legislation have not been released.
    


            “This effort is about defending our police and protecting the dignity of our neighbors,” Haywood in a statement to CNN. “Strong, trusted relationships between police and residents are essential to public safety.”
    


            Though unpopular among DC residents – 79% oppose the federal law enforcement incursion, a new Washington Post-Schar School poll said – Trump took to Truth Social on Friday, praising the effort: “Washington, D.C. is SAFE AGAIN! The crowds are coming back, the spirit is high, and our D.C. National Guard and Police are doing a fantastic job.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","The Menendez brothers were denied parole. These are the factors that are keeping them behind bars","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/23/us/menendez-brothers-parole-denial-factors","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 14:22:00 GMT","


            Erik and Lyle Menendez were denied parole by a California board this week after decades in prison for killing their parents in 1989 at their Beverly Hills mansion.
    


            During two days of hearings, the brothers were each questioned by panels of two commissioners and asked to speak with complete candor on the abuse they suffered in childhood, their mindsets leading up to and after the murders and various prison transgressions.
    


            The brothers were sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for fatally shooting Jose and Kitty Menendez. The case has long captivated true crime enthusiasts, with the brothers amassing public support in the past year after shows on Netflix renewed interest.
    


            The hearings marked the closest they have come to freedom since their convictions. Despite each receiving three-year denials, they will be eligible to request an administrative review in one year. If granted, they could appear before the parole board again as early as 18 months from now.
    


            Here are takeaways from the hearings:
    


            While it might not seem like a big deal to the nonincarcerated public, commissioners emphasized to the brothers that their use of illicit cell phones cast a shadow on their positive achievements while behind bars.
    


            Cell phones can be used to order hits, move drugs in prison and coordinate attacks on officers, they noted. Their presence meant a correctional officer had to smuggle them in, and a prison gang may have benefited by charging a tax on it, commissioner Robert Barton told Erik Menendez.
    


            “What I got in terms of the phone and my connection with the outside world was far greater than the consequences of me getting caught with the phone,” Erik Menendez said. He said he used it to speak with his wife, watch YouTube, listen to music and watch pornography.
    


            In denying him parole, Barton said his behavior was “selfish,” a sign he believes the rules do not apply to him and the “ends justify the means.”
    


            Lyle Menendez also had two recent cell phone infractions, including one in March.

            He said correctional staffers were monitoring his communications with his wife and family and selling their content to tabloids, so he saw cell phones as a privacy measure.
    


            There was “a lot of stress” in his marriage around the time he transferred to the prison in San Diego, and he wanted to stay in touch with his wife, he said.
    


            “I had convinced myself that this wasn't a means that was harming anyone but myself in a rule violation,” Lyle Menendez said. “I didn't think it really disrupted prison management very much.”
    


            Of the two, Erik Menendez committed more serious rules infractions.
    


            Commissioners questioned why he associated himself with a prison gang called the Two Fivers and helped them with a tax scheme around 2013.
    


            Menendez said he was trying to survive an “extremely violent yard” where close friends were stabbed or raped.
    


Erik Menendez denied parole after yearslong fight for release



            “I was in tremendous fear,” he said. “When the Two Fivers came and asked for help, I thought this was a great opportunity to align myself with them and to survive.”
    


            Menendez told commissioners that he prioritized protecting himself over the rules because at the time, he had no hope of ever getting out.
    


            He used drugs and alcohol in his early years behind bars but became sober in 2013 on his mother's birthday, he said.
    


            While Lyle Menendez committed fewer violations, commissioner Julie Garland said he still demonstrated “antisocial personality traits like deception, minimization and rule breaking that lie beneath that positive surface.”
    


            Prisoners who break rules are more likely to do so in society as well, she said.
    


            Commissioners expressed concerns over the killing of Kitty Menendez, with Barton saying he found that it showed Erik Menendez was “devoid of human compassion” at the time.
    


            “I can't put myself in your place. I don't know that I've ever had rage to that level, ever,” Barton said. “But that is still concerning, especially since it seems she was also a victim herself of the domestic violence.”
    


            Barton said the brothers were not in imminent fear for their lives and should have sought help from other family members or gone to the police.
    


            As for Lyle Menendez, Garland said shooting Kitty Menendez one final time was extremely “callous.” She also highlighted his actions in covering up the crime, such as lying to the police and trying to avoid prosecution.
    


            Gov. Gavin Newsom previously ordered the California parole board to conduct a risk assessment of the brothers in response to a clemency request.
    


            While it was never made public, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman revealed in May that both brothers were deemed “moderate risk.”
    


            Barton said he deemed that assessment to be neutral, as far as he considered it at all.
    


            A 2022 analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative showed that California prisoners with “moderate risk” were granted parole 22% of the time. The nonprofit ranked the state as among the most difficult for obtaining parole.
    


            More than a dozen relatives spoke at the two hearings to advocate for their release.
    


            Aunt Teresita Baralt, Jose Menendez's sister, said she is dying from Stage 4 cancer and wishes to welcome them home.
    


            “I want to make clear that although I love my brother, I have fully forgiven Erik,” she said. “Erik carries himself with kindness, integrity and strength that comes from patience and grace.”
    


            Natascha Leonardo, Kitty Menendez's great-niece, promised the parole board that she would provide a home of “unconditional love and stability” for him in Colorado, where he could spend time with family and nature.
    


            Family members said in a statement that while they are disappointed parole was denied, they are not discouraged.
    


            “We know they are good men who have done the work to rehabilitate and are remorseful,” they said. “We love them unconditionally and will continue to stand by them on the journey ahead.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","An ‘existential gamble': Why some experts are worried as SpaceX gears up for next Starship test","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/23/science/starship-megarocket-spacex","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 13:45:00 GMT","


            The most powerful rocket system ever constructed is headed for its next test — using a version of the vehicle that has been at the center of a series of explosive missteps and failures.
    


            SpaceX said it is aiming to launch its Starship megarocket on an hour-long test flight as soon as 7:30 p.m. ET Sunday, though the liftoff time is subject to change. A webcast of the event is expected to begin about 30 minutes earlier, according to the company.
    


            The uncrewed Starship prototype will follow a similar flight plan to the last three missions and aim to complete test objectives left untried during those tests, all of which ended prematurely.  SpaceX debuted the current generation of Starship vehicles in January, following a clean run of test missions with a slightly scaled-down version of the rocket in 2024.
    


            But since that debut, the vehicle has twice exploded over populated islands east of Florida, creating debris that hit roadways in Turks and Caicos and washed up onto the shores of Bahamian islands. The spacecraft also spun out of control as it headed toward its landing site in the Indian Ocean on its last test flight in May.
    


            Then, in June, a Starship spacecraft that had been strapped to an engine testing stand at the company's launch and development facilities in South Texas abruptly exploded — spewing shrapnel and causing damage to SpaceX infrastructure.
    


            These setbacks roused long-standing SpaceX critics and attracted new ones, including the Mexican government, which has threatened legal action against the company over reported debris on and around its shores. The UK government also said in a statement Thursday that it's been “working closely with US Government partners to protect the safety” of its overseas territories, including Turks and Caicos.
    


SpaceX launched the most powerful rocket ever built. Its impact is still felt in this Texas community



            The string of mishaps this year has also raised concerns among spaceflight experts and stakeholders who have emphasized that the United States has a lot riding on Starship's eventual success, including its plans to return humans to the moon as soon as 2027.
    


            And that success is not guaranteed.
    


            “It's very, very difficult to predict how this is going to end up,” said Garrett Reisman, a former NASA astronaut and SpaceX consultant who is a professor of astronautical engineering at the University of Southern California.
    


            “I think it could end up never working, or it could end up revolutionizing our entire future of activities in space — and geopolitics,” he added, referring to the US goal of displaying technical superiority to  China in a new space race.
    


            SpaceX said it implemented changes to the Starship system slated to fly this weekend in response to the last in-flight failure in May.
    


            Those alterations include adjustments to a component called a fuel diffuser, which the company believes malfunctioned during the last flight, causing higher-than-expected pressure to build up in Starship's nose cone. It is likely what caused the vehicle to spiral out of control, according to a technical overview SpaceX published last week.
    


What is ‘Kessler Syndrome' — and why do some scientists think the space disaster scenario has already started?



            Despite the series of recent problems, the Federal Aviation Administration — which licenses commercial rocket launches — said last week it had closed its investigation into SpaceX's latest mishap and approved the company's plans to fly Sunday's mission.
    


            Under current laws and regulations, the FAA is tasked solely with ensuring that commercial rocket companies do not pose a risk to public property or bystanders' safety.
    


            “There are no reports of public injury or damage to public property. The FAA oversaw and accepted the findings of the SpaceX-led investigation,” the agency said in an August 15 statement. “SpaceX identified corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of the event.”
    


            In its update, SpaceX also made clear that the version of Starship that has experienced so many issues will soon be retired.
    


            “Two flights remain with the current generation, each with test objectives designed to expand the envelope on vehicle capabilities,” according to a company blog post.
    


How SpaceX and NASA overcame a bitter culture clash to bring back US astronaut launches



            SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has already been teasing plans for larger, more ambitious iterations of the vehicle that would stretch even taller and carry more propellant.
    


            Now it appears clear that SpaceX will pursue that scaled-up version of Starship — which is already more than twice as powerful as the NASA rockets that powered the Apollo moon landings — whether or not the current line of Starship prototypes ever pulls off a successful test flight.
    


            “It's very possible that a bigger upgrade might solve the current problem,” Reisman said. “It also could introduce new problems — you never know.”



            Notably, the US government has taken several steps that could aide SpaceX in its efforts to expedite Starship testing.
    


            In May, the FAA approved the company's plans to launch Starship as many as 25 times per year from Texas, up from the five it had been previously authorized to conduct.
    


            And earlier this month, President Donald Trump — despite a public and vitriolic falling out with Musk in June — issued an executive order that appears designed to scale back roadblocks and regulatory oversight for private-sector rocket operations, including environmental reviews.
    


            Meanwhile, the stakes appear to be growing with each Starship test flight, as SpaceX is racing against the clock.



            Not only does Musk want to send one of the vehicles on an uncrewed flight to Mars when the next opportunity arises in 2026, but NASA also plans to send its astronauts to the lunar surface aboard one of the vehicles as soon as mid-2027 as part of a $2.9 billion contract.
    


Elon Musk has pledged to settle Mars. A prize-winning book offers a reality check



            “We made this bet” on Starship, said Janet Petro, who served as acting NASA administrator until July.  “They have had a rough year, but SpaceX is a pretty intense and motivated company.”
    


            Petro added she had “full confidence” that SpaceX will refine Starship's design and get the vehicle working.
    


            Reisman, the former SpaceX adviser, said he is also hopeful but less certain.
    


            “SpaceX has made an existential gamble on Starship,” Reisman said, adding that he is concerned about the rate of progress SpaceX has been making with Starship. “They're pouring a tremendous amount of money and resources into its development … but at some point, the laws of financial physics still apply.”
    


            If all goes according to plan with Starship's next flight, referred to as Flight 10, the 400-foot-tall Starship launch system will take off from SpaceX's facilities in South Texas and soar out over the waters off the coast.
    


            The bottom portion of the rocket system that gives the initial burst of power at liftoff, called Super Heavy, will attempt to make a controlled splashdown off the Texas coast,  according to SpaceX.

            For this mission, the company will not attempt to repeat its dramatic Super Heavy “chopsticks” landing in which the rocket booster steers itself back into the arms of the tower from which it launched. SpaceX said it will instead put the booster through a series of tests designed to push the vehicle to its limits “to gather real-world performance data” that could mimic a future mission that does not go as planned.
    


            Meanwhile, the upper Starship spacecraft, which is designed to one day carry cargo or convoys of astronauts but will haul only dummy satellites for this mission, will continue flying through space.
    


            During the flight, Starship will attempt to deploy the eight satellite “simulators” as well as relight one of the spacecraft's rocket engines in space. SpaceX has failed to hit both of those milestones in its last three test missions.
    


            Even if this V2 Starship prototype meets a similarly ill fate, SpaceX is likely once again to frame the test flight as a success.
    


            The company employs an engineering philosophy called “rapid iterative development,” which emphasizes a pursuit of launching relatively cheap prototypes on frequent test missions over extensive ground testing or other less risky simulations.
    


            Because of its unique development approach, SpaceX has been known to embrace fiery mishaps. The company has said that even failed test flights help engineers improve Starship's design — quicker than if SpaceX employed alternative engineering approaches.
    


            “Every lesson learned, through both flight and ground testing, continues to feed directly into designs for the next generation of Starship and Super Heavy,” SpaceX's August 15 statement reads. “Two flights remain with the current generation, each with test objectives designed to expand the envelope on vehicle capabilities as we iterate towards fully and rapidly reusable, reliable rockets.”
    


            SpaceX's development approach, while often seen as risky and brazen, has served the company well in the past.
    


            Rarely has one of the company's rockets malfunctioned once it leaves the development stage and becomes operational. The company's human spaceflight track record, using Falcon 9 rockets, has been spotless.
    


            And if Starship does eventually work, Reisman said, it won't only be SpaceX — or even NASA — that benefits.
    


            “The entire space industry is hoping and betting on Starship working, because if it achieves its promise, it'll also be a revolution in affordability,” Reisman said. “I think there's causes for optimism and pessimism — and I think it's very, very difficult to predict how this is going to end up.”

Jeffrey Epstein's confidante and partner Ghislaine Maxwell has said she does not believe the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender committed suicide behind bars.

Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for trafficking women including one child to the sexual predator Epstein, was interviewed by the Department of Justice last month due to renewed interest in the case.

According to a transcript released Friday, Maxwell told investigators, “I do not believe he died by suicide, no.” She dismissed the idea that an outside party could have ordered a “hit” on Epstein, adding, “If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation.”

When asked if Epstein could have been targeted because he possessed damaging information on powerful figures, Maxwell said, “I do not have any reason to believe that. And I also think it's ludicrous.” She added, “If that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty of opportunity when he wasn't in jail.”

Maxwell also denied that Epstein engaged in blackmail or kept a “client list” linked to sex trafficking.

Epstein was found dead in 2019 in his cell at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Democrats, along with some conservative figures, have accused President Donald Trump of a coverup after FBI and DOJ reviews denied the existence of an “Epstein list.”

Trump, who has said he ended his friendship with Epstein long before his 2008 conviction, described the accusations as part of a Democrat-led discreditation campaign.

US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired three senior officials at the Pentagon, including the head of its intelligence agency, several media outlets reported on Friday.

The exact reason for the dismissals has not been clarified, but they followed leaks suggesting that US strikes on the Iranian nuclear program did not destroy it completely, contrary to claims by US President Donald Trump.

According to three US officials cited by Reuters, Hegseth has dismissed Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, who led the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), as well as two senior Navy commanders. CNN sources identified them as Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, chief of the Navy Reserve, and Rear Adm. Milton Sands, a Navy SEAL officer overseeing Naval Special Warfare Command.

A Washington Post source indicated that Kruse's removal stemmed from a “loss of confidence” following reports claiming that an internal DIA assessment of US military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities in June had only delayed Tehran's program by only a few months.

Trump blasted the leaks as “fake news” while he and Hegseth insisted that Iran's nuclear program had been “obliterated.”

In recent months, the Trump administration embarked on a campaign to reshape the Pentagon's leadership, removing Gen. C.Q. Brown Jr. as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while Gen. David Allvin announced early retirement as Air Force chief of staff this month. Both moves were seen as driven by disagreements with the administration over strategy. Trump earlier also vowed to eradicate “woke” ideologies from the military.

Earlier this week, the administration also revoked security clearances for dozens of current and former officials, with Tulsi Gabbard, US Director of National Intelligence, accusing them of “politicizing and manipulating intelligence, leaking classified intelligence without authorization, and/or committing intentional egregious violations of tradecraft standards”.

This week the Israeli army launched a full-scale ground operation to seize the city of Gaza. The plan is ambitious and ruthless: 60,000 new reservists will be called up and another 20,000 troops will have their service extended. For Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this is a “necessary step” to ensure Israel's security. For the international community, it looks like a gamble that could push Israel into near-total isolation.

The United Nations has already warned that the offensive will trigger “mass destruction” and the death of civilians, including thousands of children already suffering from hunger. Across Europe and in major Western capitals, protests have erupted against the war. Yet Netanyahu shows no sign of backing down. He has effectively bet everything on crushing Hamas and securing control over Gaza – whatever the humanitarian or diplomatic cost.

This latest escalation does not happen in a vacuum. It comes after nearly two years of mounting tensions between Israel and its traditional Western allies, a process that began in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and has since transformed Israel's international standing. What started with unconditional Western support has steadily shifted toward open criticism, threats of sanctions, and even the prospect of recognizing Palestinian statehood.

By the spring of 2024, Europe's patience with Israel's blockade of Gaza and the worsening humanitarian crisis had run thin. Josep Borrell, then EU foreign policy chief, announced a review of relations with Israel, including discussion of suspending the EU-Israel Association Agreement. London froze free trade talks. Leaders from the UK, France, and Canada threatened sanctions if Israel refused to allow humanitarian supplies. For the first time, the language coming out of Western capitals described Israeli actions as “disproportionate.”

Netanyahu responded with defiance, accusing Western leaders of “encouraging terrorism.” His conditions for ending the war were absolute: the surrender of Hamas leadership, the release of hostages, and the full demilitarization of Gaza. Any alternative, he insisted, was unacceptable.

Europe's pressure soon moved from rhetoric to legal measures. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, while France broke precedent as the first G7 nation to recognize Palestinian statehood. Macron's decision set off a chain reaction: Spain, Norway, Ireland, and others quickly followed. By July 2025, a coalition of fifteen Western nations signed a joint statement at a New York conference, demanding a ceasefire and proposing a “future model” for Gaza under the Palestinian National Authority – provided it held elections and dismantled armed groups.

Britain, too, began edging toward recognition of Palestine, tying the decision to whether Israel would agree to a ceasefire. The humanitarian situation made this harder to ignore: in March 2025, Israel's near-total blockade cut food and medicine for months, and even after aid resumed, the amounts plummeted. Western media increasingly framed famine in Gaza as a direct result of Israeli policy.

Even Washington showed signs of strain. Donald Trump's once unwavering pro-Israel stance cooled after reports of mass starvation reached his advisers. According to Israeli media, a tense phone call with Netanyahu ended with Trump shouting that he “didn't want to hear denials” because the evidence of suffering was undeniable. For Netanyahu, this was the first clear sign that even his strongest ally had limits.

Europe, meanwhile, pursued a multilayered strategy. Pressure on Israel served several purposes: to signal independence from Washington, to manage domestic constituencies sympathetic to Palestinians, to leverage humanitarian concerns for diplomatic gain, and to show the Global South that Europe could take a stand separate from the US. But this “sovereignty” remains largely rhetorical. Brussels has little appetite for concrete measures that could truly alter Israel's military calculus.

That cynicism may, in fact, work to Europe's advantage. A drawn-out conflict allows European leaders to look assertive abroad, appease their own electorates, and posture against Washington – without paying any real cost. Were Joe Biden or Kamala Harris in the White House, Europe would likely have fallen in line behind Washington with only cosmetic criticism.

For Netanyahu, however, the stakes are existential. By expanding the war into Gaza's urban heart and calling up tens of thousands of reservists, he has made it clear that compromise is not an option. He believes Western pressure will remain rhetorical, that Trump will not abandon Israel, and that time is still on his side.

But the higher the stakes, the lonelier Israel becomes. Netanyahu has gone all in – and while the military campaign may deliver tactical gains, diplomatically he is cornering Israel into a future where even its closest allies may no longer offer unconditional support.

BERLIN, August 23. /TASS/. More than 60% of Germans express dissatisfaction with the performance of the CDU/CSU-SPD coalition government, according to a recent poll conducted by the INSA sociological institute for Bild am Sonntag. The survey reveals that nearly 60% are unhappy with Chancellor Friedrich Merz's leadership, highlighting a significant decline in public confidence.

The poll results show that 62% of respondents are dissatisfied with the work of Germany's ruling coalition, with only 26% rating the government's performance positively. Meanwhile, 57% of Germans disapprove of Merz's leadership, compared to 28% who hold a favorable view. Notably, Merz's support has decreased from 49% when he assumed office in early May.

In terms of political party support, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) now stands at 25%, matching the CDU/CSU bloc—marking the conservative parties' worst showing in recent months. The last time the CDU/CSU held a similar level was on May 12 of this year. Six months ago, in the federal elections, the CDU/CSU secured 28.5%, indicating a loss of 3.5 percentage points over that period.

The survey also sheds light on the broader political landscape. The CDU/CSU and SPD coalition - collectively known as the conservative-red bloc - currently commands only 40% of voter support, insufficient for a parliamentary majority. The SPD itself has dwindled to just 15%, a slight decline from its 16.4% in the recent federal elections, which was its lowest-ever result. Other parties garner modest support: the Greens at 11%, the Left Party at 11%, the Free Democratic Party (FDP) at 3%, and the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance - Reason and Justice at 4%. With these figures, most of these parties would struggle to enter the Bundestag.

The survey was conducted from August 21 to 22, with a sample size of 1,001 respondents. The data on party preferences was gathered between August 18 and 22, involving 1,201 participants.

Since early May, when the Bundestag elected Merz as chancellor in a historic second-round vote - an unprecedented event in German history - public confidence has waned. The last elections on February 23 resulted in the fall of the ruling ""traffic light coalition"", which had collapsed last November over disagreements on budget and financial policies, including further aid to Kiev. In that vote, the CDU/CSU emerged victorious with 28.5%, while the AfD achieved a historic second-place finish with 20.8%. The SPD trailed with 16.4%, followed by the Greens at 11.6% and the Left Party at 8.8%.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Camp at Fort Bliss base on US-Mexico border described as ‘dangerous misuse of military land and resources'

Prominent Democratic lawmakers and legal advocates have called for the new immigration detention camp at Fort Bliss military base to be shut down amid accusations of lack of external oversight and concerns over access to legal services.

Camp East Montana began full operation last weekend as a sprawling tent facility across acres of military land in the eastern part of El Paso, on the US-Mexico border in west Texas, amid rapid expansion plans and much controversy.

Dubbed the “Lone Star Lockup” by Republicans, the new facility currently accommodates around 1,000 beds for men. It is set to expand to 5,000 beds at a cost of around $1.24bn in private contracts, making it the largest among the ranks of immigration detention facilities already working overtime across the US.

With an integrated operation to run deportation flights, the Texas military complex is set to transform part of itself into the deportation hub it was forecast to become for Donald Trump's hard-right anti-immigration agenda.

After a brief tour of the site on Thursday, Texas Democratic congresswoman Jasmine Crockett said: “What I saw today was a dangerous misuse of military land and resources to cage human beings. This attempt doesn't make our country safer, it wastes taxpayer dollars, rips families apart, and takes us backwards as a nation.”

El Paso Democratic congresswoman Veronica Escobar called the new camp “massive” and decried the $1.2bn price tag when such a sum could elevate public services in a city like El Paso. She told local media it would be a strain on the city's resources.

With the thermometer relentlessly in the 90s Fahrenheit or higher in the summer, and sandstorms a regular occurrence, it is unclear how conditions for detainees will be managed.

“We demand the immediate closure of Camp East Montana,” said Samantha Singleton, policy director of the Border Network for Human Rights.

She said: “The opening of the country's largest Ice detention site has been treated like a ribbon-cutting ceremony by the Trump administration, an event to celebrate, when it should have been an alarm, a moment for reflection and a call to change the course of Fort Bliss.”

She added: “The shameful use of a military base for immigration detention is a disgrace to the values of our city and our country” and called for “rigorous oversight”, pledging that “we will document every abuse”.

Ice, part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has said Camp East Montana will serve as a short-term processing site to “decompress” other detention centers amid accelerating arrests and will handle deportations via Ice air operations.

The camp has been constructed under a Department of Defense contract. Acquisition Logistics, based in Henrico county, Virginia was awarded a $231.8m initial contract to establish and operate the facility, which Ice will manage and, the federal agency said, be in line with its detention standards.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the DHS issued a statement saying the Trump administration is working “at turbo speed” on mass deportations.

“The Fort Bliss facility will offer everything a traditional Ice detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals. It also provides necessary accommodations for disabilities, diet, and religious beliefs,” the statement said.

Crockett said she briefed the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and several immigrant rights advocates in El Paso and southern New Mexico on her observations, as some legal advocates have been unable to meet with detainees.

The ACLU said Fort Bliss was used during Trump's first term to detain children who were separated from their families and in 2021, under the Biden administration, government investigators reported children detained at the base suffered emotional distress amid inadequate staffing and care. Children were under held under the authority of the Department of Health and Human Services, while the adults detained now are held by Ice.

The base was used for internment during World War II and detention of Mexican refugees previously, in harsh conditions, with the ACLU calling it “a staging ground for policies driven by cruelty and exclusion” and Camp East Montana “another dark chapter”.

Florida on Friday appealed the court-ordered closure of another recent and highly-controversial detention camp in the Everglades called Alligator Alcatraz.

Osvaldo Grimaldo, a policy and advocacy strategist for border and immigrants' rights at the ACLU of Texas, said Camp East Montana “is part of a broader effort at both the state and federal levels to instill fear and accelerate mass deportations, no matter the human cost, and far too often without any due process”.

Ice has pledged to provide legal representation. But Grimaldo said there was no guarantee.

“When people are locked away in remote facilities, far from courts and far from their families, the right to legal representation becomes an empty promise,” he said.

Melissa Lopez, the executive director of Estrella del Paso, a social services organization, said she worried that as the camp fills, medical services and care of detainees will “quickly fall to the wayside”, adding that the rapidly-constructed camp was “a shock to us, a shock to due process and a shock to…basic human decency.”

Texas Republican congressman John Cornyn said the facility would be used for those with final deportation orders and those with criminal convictions as a short term processing location before expulsion from the US. He pledged there would be conventional congressional oversight.

Fort Bliss has already been used to fly deportees on military aircraft to Guantánamo Bay and Central and South America under the second Trump administration.

“We already know that the use of military bases for mass detention is wasteful, intentionally cruel and unnecessary. Yet here we are,” said Marisa Limón Garza, the executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center.

“It's really just about targeting people, racial profiling and rounding up of numbers to meet quotas, which is ignoring humanity and any kind of right to being a dignified person,” she said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

California brothers convicted of their parents' murders in 1989 were both denied parole this week – here's what we know

This week's parole hearings were the latest twist in the saga of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who have been behind bars since their arrest in 1990 for killing their parents with shotguns.

At their televised trial, which was a 1990s media sensation, the brothers said the killings were an act of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father.

A panel of California commissioners denied Erik Menendez parole on Thursday. Then on Friday, Lyle Menendez was also denied parole. Here are four key takeaways from the hearings this week.

More than a dozen relatives of the two brothers testified in favor of their release at the parole hearings, and they reacted with anger to the decision to keep them behind bars for at least three more years. “How is my dad a threat to society!!!!!” Erik's stepdaughter Talia Menendez wrote on Instagram. “This has been decades of torture to our family. How much longer???”

Erik's wife, Tammi Menendez, accused the presiding commissioner of the two-person panel, Robert Barton, of bias in a post on X. During the hearing Barton told Erik Menendez, “Contrary to your supporters' beliefs, you have not been a model prisoner,” and cited his possession of a contraband phone.

Support for the brothers has grown since a generation of younger Americans were introduced to the case by the release of the Netflix series Monsters, in which Javier Bardem and Chloë Sevigny played their parents, and a Netflix documentary, featuring phone interviews with both Lyle and Erik. The new media attention has propelled support for the brothers on social networks, including TikTok and Instagram.

Even so, the fictional drama series, which suggested without evidence that the brothers had an incestuous relationship, was denounced by family members as a “grotesque shockadrama”. In a statement, the family called Monsters “a phobic, gross, anachronistic, serial episode nightmare that is not only riddled with mistruths and outright falsehoods but ignores the most recent exculpatory revelations”. Erik Menendez also called the series a “dishonest portrayal” and criticized what he called “horrible and blatant lies” in the series.

Lawyers for the brothers filed a petition to a Los Angeles superior court judge in 2023 in which they argued that two pieces of evidence discovered after their trials support their claims that they were sexually abused by their father. If the judge agrees, the brothers could be granted a new trial or given reduced sentences.

The first piece of evidence is a letter, discovered by a reporter, in which Erik described years of sexual abuse by his father to a cousin when he was 17. The second piece of evidence is the testimony of a former member of the boyband Menudo who said in a 2023 documentary that the father of the Menendez brothers had sexually assaulted him when he was a teenager.

The movement to release the Menendez brothers suffered a setback last November, when George Gascón, the progressive prosecutor who had supported a reduction in their sentences – from life in prison without the possibility of parole – lost his bid for re-election as Los Angeles county district attorney to Nathan Hochman, a Republican who opposed parole.

On the eve of the election last year, Gascón said in a statement that society's understanding of the impact of sexual abuse had evolved. “Since the original prosecution of the Menendez brothers more than nearly three decades ago, our office has gained a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding sexual violence. We recognize that it is a widespread issue impacting individuals of all gender identities, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to support all victims as they navigate the long-lasting effects of such trauma,” Gascón wrote.

Less than two weeks later, Gascón lost to Hochman by nearly 20 points.

On Thursday, Hochman said in a statement that the decision to deny parole to Erik Menendez “does justice for Jose and Kitty Menendez, the victims of the brutal murders carried out by their sons on August 20 1989”.

“The prior administration's motion for resentencing failed to examine or consider whether the Menendez brothers have exhibited full insight into, and taken complete responsibility for, their crimes,” Hochman added, in reference to Gascón's moves to make parole a possibility.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has said at least 61 people were killed and 308 injured in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours.

The ministry said a number of victims remained under rubble and on the streets, with ambulance and civil defence crews unable to reach them.

According to its daily update, the cumulative death toll in Gaza has risen to 62,622, with 157,673 injured since 7 October 2023.

From when Israel ended the ceasefire on March 18, the ministry said 10,778 people have been killed and 45,632 injured.

It noted that 298 fatalities had been added to the tally after confirmation by a judicial committee handling missing persons cases.

The ministry reported that at least 16 people were killed and 111 injured while attempting to collect aid in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of what the ministry describes as “aid victims” to 2,076 killed, and more than 15,308 injured since the war began.

Hospitals also recorded eight new deaths due to starvation and malnutrition, including two children, bringing the total to 281 deaths from hunger, of whom 114 were children.

It's nearly 5pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here's the latest:

The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said at least 61 people were killed and 308 injured in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours. It said victims remained under rubble and in the streets, with crews unable to reach them.

The Wafa news agency reported that at least nine civilians were killed in separate Israeli strikes across Gaza on Saturday.

At least 16 people were killed and 111 injured while attempting to collect aid in the past 24 hours, the ministry said, bringing the total number of what it describes as “aid victims” to 2,076 killed and more than 15,308 injured since the war began.

Eight people, including two children, died of starvation in Gaza hospitals in the past day, according to health officials. That brings the total number of recorded deaths from hunger to 281, of whom 114 were children.

Strikes also targeted tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis, home to hundreds of thousands who had fled elsewhere in Gaza. More than half the victims were women and children, the AP reported.

In northern Gaza, Israeli gunfire killed at least five people waiting for aid near the Zikim crossing, where UN and other agencies' convoys enter the strip, health officials at Sheikh Radwan field hospital told AP.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organisation, urged more medical evacuations, warning that 15,600 patients, including 3,800 children, need specialised care.

Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, said famine in Gaza is worsening “by the hour” and urged Israel to let aid in at scale. UNRWA said it has warehouses full of food, medicines and hygiene supplies in Jordan and Egypt but has been blocked from bringing them into Gaza.

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces continued a large-scale assault on the village of al-Mughayyir near Ramallah. Marzouq Abu Naim, deputy head of the village council, told Wafa that troops had stormed more than 30 homes, destroyed property, and smashed or seized dozens of vehicles.

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said its clinics around Gaza City are treating large numbers of people as bombardments force further displacement. “Strikes are forcing people, including MSF staff, to flee their homes once again, and we are seeing displacement across Gaza City,” the group said.

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he spoke by phone with his French, German and British counterparts to prevent a vote on UN sanctions over Tehran's nuclear programme, ahead of a European deadline.

A senior health official in Gaza has warned of severe overcrowding in a children's malnutrition clinic as famine in the enclave reaches what he described as a “critical phase”.

Ahmed al-Farra, director of the Tahrir hospital for children and maternity at the Nasser medical complex in Khan Younis, appeared in a video released by the health ministry showing crowded scenes inside the clinic.

In a translation carried by Anadolu news agency, al-Farra said the clinic, which operates only two days a week, is now receiving “three to four times” the expected number of patients.

“Each day the clinic is open, no fewer than 52 new cases are diagnosed,” he said.

Al-Farra highlighted the case of 18-month-old Shahd Mohammed Zaarab, who weighs just 5.8kg compared to the normal 11–12kg for her age. He said the child was suffering from acute malnutrition, having lost both fat and muscle mass.

“Her condition is like a skeleton covered with skin,” he said.

Earlier we reported that eight people died of starvation in Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian health ministry.

The commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has warned that Israel would face a “more crushing response” if it carried out further attacks against the country, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).

Major General Mohammad Pakpour made the comments on Saturday during a meeting with Ahmadreza Pourkhaghan, head of the judiciary organisation of the armed forces.

Referring to the IRGC's combat readiness, Pakpour said:

If the Zionist regime repeats its aggression against the country, it will receive a more regret-inducing and crushing response than the 12-day war in June.

He added that ensuring the safety and security of IRGC personnel would remain a priority “as in the past”.

Arif Husain, chief economist at the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), has explained what qualifies as a famine after the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) formally declared one in parts of Gaza.

In a video posted to X, Husain said:

Famine is a technical term. We say there is a famine when three conditions come together in a specific geographic area. First, at least 20 percent of the population, in that particular place must be facing extreme levels of hunger.

Second, 30 percent of the children in the same place must be wasted, they are too tall for their weight, so they're very skinny basically.

And the third condition is that the mortality rate must double from the average of, for adults, one person per 10,000 per day, to two people per 10,000 per day. When these three conditions come together, we say it's a famine.

On Friday, the IPC said an estimated 514,000 people in Gaza – about a quarter of the enclave's population – are experiencing famine, a figure expected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.

Israel has denied that a famine is taking place, while the United States appeared to dismiss the findings as part of what it called a “false narrative of deliberate mass starvation” promoted by Hamas.

Earlier today, we reported that eight people had starved to death in Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian health ministry.

Gaza's civil defence service, made up of local emergency crews, say they carried out 39 missions in the past 24 hours as Israeli strikes hit tents sheltering displaced people in the enclave.

Crews reported operations in the Beach Camp in the north, and in Rafah to the south, where tents for displaced people were struck by Israeli forces.

Patients were taken from attacks near schools, mosques and hospitals, including al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat and tents in the Asdaa area of Rafah, where ten people were rushed to treatment.

Civil defence also reported transporting victims from strikes in Khan Younis and Gaza City, including fires in the Rimal neighbourhood.

One of the dead was transported from al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat, others were injured by gunfire, the civil defence said.

The service said the scale of operations underlined the pressure on emergency crews who continue to recover the wounded, and the dead, from across Gaza.

With ground troops already active in strategic areas, the widescale operation in Gaza City could start within days, reports the Associated Press (AP).
 Aid group Doctors without Borders, or Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said on Saturday its clinics around Gaza City are seeing high numbers of patients as people flee recent bombardments. The group said in a statement that “strikes are forcing people, including MSF staff, to flee their homes once again, and we are seeing displacement across Gaza City″.
 According to the AP, the Israeli military has said troops are operating on the outskirts of Gaza City and in the city's Zeitoun neighbourhood.

Israeli strikes killed at least 14 people in the southern Gaza Strip early on Saturday, according to morgue records and health officials at Nasser hospital, reports the Associated Press (AP).

The officials said the strikes targeted tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis, which became home to hundreds of thousands who had fled from elsewhere in Gaza. More than half of the dead were women and children, reported the AP.Awad Abu Agala, uncle of two children who died, told the AP no place in Gaza is now safe. “The entire Gaza Strip is being bombed … In the south. In the north. Everywhere,” Abu Agala said, explaining that the children were targeted overnight while in their tents. 
 In northern Gaza, Israeli gunfire killed at least five aid-seekers on Saturday near the Zikim crossing with Israel, where UN and other agencies' convoys enter the territory, health officials at the Sheikh Radwan field hospital told the AP. 
 Six people were killed in other attacks on Gaza elsewhere Saturday, according to hospitals and the Palestinian Red Crescent.
 The Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions from the AP about the deaths.

It is 2.49pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here is a summary of today's blog so far:

The Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza has said at least 61 people were killed and 308 injured in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours. The ministry said a number of victims remained under rubble and on the streets, with ambulance and civil defence crews unable to reach them. The Wafa news agency reported that at least nine Palestinian civilians had been killed in a series of Israeli attacks across Gaza on Saturday.

The ministry reported that at least 16 people were killed and 111 injured while attempting to collect aid in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of what the ministry describes as “aid victims” to 2,076 killed, and more than 15,308 injured since the war began.

Hospitals in Gaza also recorded eight new deaths due to starvation and malnutrition, including two children, bringing the total to 281 deaths from hunger, of whom 114 were children.

Israel has dismantled the proven and internationally backed civilian model of aid distribution in Gaza, according to a joint report from Forensic Architecture (FA) and the World Peace Foundation (WPF), which said the move has furthered both Israel's military objectives and starvation in the territory.

The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for an urgent scale-up of evacuations from Gaza, warning that more than 15,600 patients remain in need of specialised care, including 3,800 children. In a post on X, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus thanked the UAE for supporting the latest evacuation of critically injured and sick patients but stressed that far more action is needed.

The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, has called on Israel to allow aid into Gaza at scale, saying famine in the territory is worsening by the hour. He also shared comments from undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, Tom Fletcher, who said the famine confirmed by the IPC report should be read “in sorrow and in anger”.

Unrwa says it has warehouses full of food, medicines and hygiene supplies in Jordan and Egypt but is being blocked from bringing them into Gaza. “While famine is confirmed in Gaza City, we have warehouses full of food waiting to be allowed in,” the agency said in a post on X.

Israeli forces have continued their large-scale assault on the village of al-Mughayyir, northeast of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, carrying out raids and widespread destruction of property, according to a local official cited by the Wafa news agency. Marzouq Abu Naim, the deputy head of the village council, told Wafa that since dawn troops had stormed more than 30 homes, issuing threats, destroying property, and smashing or seizing dozens of vehicles.

Protesters backing a deal for the release of hostages in Gaza confronted Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and his son in central Israel, the Times of Israel reports. Crowds chanted “shame” and held up posters of hostages still held in Gaza. Ben-Gvir – who was barred from serving in the army as a teenager due to extremist activities – was heard telling his son, Shoval: “These are draft dodgers.” One protester shouted back, calling Ben-Gvir himself a “draft dodger”.

Action Against Hunger has warned of “extreme vulnerability under the mothers and their children that are undernourished” as famine spreads across Gaza. The group's nutrition teams recorded more than 400 cases of malnourished children in July and August alone, 20% of them severe. According to UN and INGO data, thousands of new cases are being registered each month.

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has said spoken by phone with his French, German and British counterparts in a bid to prevent a vote on UN sanctions over Tehran's nuclear programme, just days ahead of a European deadline. The call came as the three European powers threatened to trigger the “snapback” provision of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which allows any party to reimpose sanctions if they believe Iran is not complying with commitments such as international monitoring of its nuclear activities.

Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp has stepped down after failing to secure cabinet approval for additional sanctions on Israel over its war in Gaza. Veldkamp, a member of the centre-right New Social Contract party, said he was unable to achieve any agreement, while citing “geopolitical tensions”.

Turning our attention to the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces have continued their large-scale assault on the village of al-Mughayyir, northeast of Ramallah, carrying out raids and widespread destruction of property, according to a local official cited by the Wafa news agency.

Marzouq Abu Naim, the deputy head of the village council, told Wafa that since dawn troops had stormed more than 30 homes, issuing threats, destroying property, and smashing or seizing dozens of vehicles.

He added that bulldozers were continuing work on a new road through the village, destroying thousands of dunums of olive groves.

The escalation comes after Israel on Wednesday announced its approval of a major new settlement block in the West Bank, which far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich suggsted was designed to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state.

On Thursday, UK foreign secretary David Lammy joined 20 other foreign ministers in condemning the settlement plan. The Foreign Office said it had also summoned the Israeli ambassador in London to make Britain's position clear.

The ICJ regards both Israeli occupation and settlement building in the West Bank as illegal under international law.

The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has said at least 61 people were killed and 308 injured in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours.

The ministry said a number of victims remained under rubble and on the streets, with ambulance and civil defence crews unable to reach them.

According to its daily update, the cumulative death toll in Gaza has risen to 62,622, with 157,673 injured since 7 October 2023.

From when Israel ended the ceasefire on March 18, the ministry said 10,778 people have been killed and 45,632 injured.

It noted that 298 fatalities had been added to the tally after confirmation by a judicial committee handling missing persons cases.

The ministry reported that at least 16 people were killed and 111 injured while attempting to collect aid in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of what the ministry describes as “aid victims” to 2,076 killed, and more than 15,308 injured since the war began.

Hospitals also recorded eight new deaths due to starvation and malnutrition, including two children, bringing the total to 281 deaths from hunger, of whom 114 were children.

Karim is a trained nurse in his early 20s from Gaza City. He has been displaced by the war 12 times and survived an Israeli strike in Rafah. He now lives in the ruins of his former home with his parents and four brothers. He kept a diary for the Guardian over the course of a week.

3 August 2025Today, I have to do something a bit “exciting”. I'm going to a food distribution point for the first time, what I call the death lottery. I'm leaving in about 30 minutes. I've said goodbye to my family and hugged them all. You never know.

4 August 2025Do you know the series Squid Game? I swear, they're playing with us just like that. I lay on the ground at the aid point in Zikim for almost three hours without moving. If anyone moved – like one old man apparently did, they shot him. He got a bullet straight in the neck.

6 August 2025I usually avoid the news. I can't stand watching it – too much pain, too much politics. I scroll through Instagram a little, and sometimes I search for scholarships, hoping to find a way out of here. I'm desperate to escape with my family.

The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has called on Israel to allow aid into Gaza at scale, saying famine in the territory is worsening by the hour.

In a post on X, Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA commissioner-general, said:

It's time for the Government of Israel to stop denying the famine it has created in Gaza. All of those who have influence must use it with determination and a sense of moral duty. Every hour counts.

He also shared comments from Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Tom Fletcher, who said the famine confirmed by the IPC report should be read “in sorrow and in anger”.

Fletcher wrote that the crisis was “a famine we could have prevented” but food was being blocked by “systematic obstruction by Israel”.

In his closing appeal, Fletcher said: “My plea, my demand to Prime Minister Netanyahu: Enough. Ceasefire. Open the crossings, north and south … It is too late for far too many. But not for everyone in Gaza. Enough. For humanity's sake, let us in.”

It comes after the Israeli prime minister claimed yesterday the IPC report was “an absolute lie” and “a modern blood libel”.

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — The world's leading authority on food crises said Friday the Gaza Strip's largest city is gripped by famine, and that it's likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is happening in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.

The determination comes after months of warnings by aid groups that Israel's restrictions of food and other aid into Gaza, and its military offensive, were causing starvation among Palestinian civilians, particularly children.

Israel rejected the report, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it an “outright lie.”

The grim milestone — the first time the IPC has confirmed a famine in the Middle East — is sure to ramp up international pressure on Israel, which has been fighting Hamas since the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Israel says it plans to seize Gaza City and other Hamas strongholds, an escalation experts say will exacerbate the hunger crisis.

The IPC said hunger has been driven by fighting and the blockade of aid, and magnified by widespread displacement and the collapse of food production in Gaza, pushing hunger to life-threatening levels across the entire territory after 22 months of war.

More than half a million people in Gaza, about a quarter of its population, face catastrophic levels of hunger, with many at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes, the IPC report said.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the findings show a “human-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself” and appealed for an “immediate ceasefire.”

Netanyahu denies there's hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation “lies” promoted by Hamas. “The IPC report is an outright lie. Israel does not have a policy of starvation,” his office posted on X.

The U.S. State Department also sought to cast doubt on the report. It said the humanitarian situation in Gaza “is a serious concern,” but blamed Hamas and looters for the difficulties in delivering aid.

After the publication of images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of hunger-related deaths in recent weeks, Israel announced measures to let more humanitarian aid in. Yet the United Nations says what's entering is far below what's needed.

The Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory, known as COGAT, called the report “false and biased.” It said significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks.

Israel's Foreign Ministry said more than 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, including a massive influx in recent weeks. But experts say Gaza is still reeling from the tightening of the blockade from early March until mid-May, when Israel barred the import of all food, medicine and other goods.

“A rapidly increasing number of people, especially young children, are dying preventable deaths from starvation and disease because Israel made starvation a core part of its campaign to control the strip,” said Chris Newton, an analyst for the International Crisis Group.

Netanyahu says more military pressure is needed to achieve Israel's goals of freeing the hostages held by Hamas and eliminating the militant group altogether.

Formal famine determinations are rare. The IPC says a famine exists in an area when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:

At least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children 6 months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, based on a weight-to-height measurement; or 15% of that age group suffer from acute malnutrition based on the circumference of their upper arm. And at least two people, or four children under 5, per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.

The data analyzed between July 1 and Aug. 15 showed clear evidence that thresholds for starvation and acute malnutrition have been reached. Gathering data for mortality has been harder, but the IPC said it is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the necessary threshold has likely been reached.

The IPC warned that a third of Gaza's population could face catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of September, and that this is probably an undercount.

Alex de Waal, author of “Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine” and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, said that had Israel allowed the IPC better access to collect data, a famine might have been determined months ago, which would have raised global awareness sooner.

“It seems that it's necessary for experts to shout ‘famine!' before the world takes notice, by which time it is too late,” he said.

Israel has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. It says there's currently no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza. It also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that requires Palestinians to travel long distances and pass through Israeli military lines to get aid.

The traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds overwhelm entering convoys.

Witnesses, health officials and the U.N. rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid from both providers, while Israel says it has only fired warning shots and that the toll is exaggerated.

On the eve of the war, Gaza City was home to some 700,000 people, about the population of Washington.

Throughout the conflict, it has been the focus of regular Israeli bombardment and ground operations. Several neighborhoods have been almost completely destroyed. Hundreds of thousands fled under Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year.

Doctors and nurses in Gaza in recent weeks have seen rising numbers of visibly malnourished patients.

Kirsty Blacka, an Australian emergency nurse who worked in Gaza City's Al-Quds hospital through June, said emaciated men with no preexisting conditions were coming in looking like teenagers because they were starving.

She said the lack of food has been compounded by contaminated water causing diarrhea and infections, and that diseases are harder to recover from when people are malnourished. Thousands will be too weak to evacuate the city ahead of the planned offensive, said Blacka.

Families in Gaza City say they're watching their loved ones waste away.

Yousef Sbeteh's two teenage children were wounded by an Israeli airstrike in June and have spent the last two months in the hospital. While there, they've both lost weight because there hasn't been enough food, he said, adding that he can't afford to buy more because prices at markets have soared. Doctors say the teenagers had no preexisting conditions.

His 15-year-old daughter, Aya, lost nearly 20 kilograms (44 pounds), or about 30% of her body weight, according to her doctors. Her 17-year-old brother Ahmad has lost about 15 kilograms (33 pounds). The lack of nutritional supplements and healthy food is slowing their recovery, doctors say.

“Doctors say she needs protein, meat and fish,” Sbeteh said while sitting beside his frail daughter. “But I can't provide that now.”

A Ukrainian MiG-29 pilot was killed after completing a combat mission early on Aug. 23, according to a statement by Ukraine's Air Force.

The pilot, Major Serhii Bondar, died during landing, the Air Force said in its statement. The causes and circumstances are still being established, it added.

The Air Force did not specify what mission the pilot was carrying out when the death occurred. During Russia's aerial attacks on Ukraine, which have grown increasingly intense and frequent in recent months, Ukraine's pilots often work with land-based air defense to repel the attacks.

Overnight, Russia attacked Ukraine with 49 Shahed combat drones and decoys, according to the Air Force. Thirteen struck targets, while 36 were repelled, the Air Force said.

In June, Bondar was formally honored alongside other soldiers with a state award ""for personal courage shown in protecting the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and selfless performance of military duty"" in a formal decree signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky. He was born in 1979.

Several pilots have died since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including the recent death of F-16 pilot Lieutenant Colonel Maksym Ustymenko, who died in June while repelling a massive Russian aerial attack of 477 drones and 60 missiles. Ustymenko shot down seven targets that night before his aircraft was damaged, and lost alitutde before crashing.

A 31-year-old Russian serviceman claimed in an interview to have participated in the May 2024 killing of five captured Ukrainian soldiers in Donetsk Oblast, according to Polish-Belarusian media outlet Vot Tak. 

The five Ukrainian soldiers were allegedly captured on May 5, 2024, in the village of Karlovka, near Avdiivka. They were stripped of their phones and body armor, then brought to a garden and shot in the back of their heads while kneeling, according to an audio recording of the interview that Vot Tak released. 

Vot Tak said it was unable to confirm the soldier's account of the executions, but that it sent a request to the Prosecutor General of Ukraine for any information about Ukrainian servicemen killed in Karlovka. 

The Russian-language outlet is focused on Eastern Europe and Eurasia and was created by Polish state media to counter official Russian and Belarusian propaganda. 

The Kyiv Independent contacted Ukraine's Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets for comment on the reported events but was not able to reach him before publication.

The Russian serviceman who described the shootings, Ivan Okhlopkov, said the Ukrainian men were left unburied and that mortar shelling eventually destroyed their remains, and that he did not regret his actions and did not remember details about the men. Okhlopkov said he and four or five others in his battalion carried out the executions, which he said were ordered by their commander. 

Okhlopkov and the soldiers that took part in executions were part of the notorious Somalia Battalion, members of which have been alleged of committing war crimes in the past.

Okhlopkov, who was serving time in prison for theft when he signed a contract to join the Russian military, said he deserted the army and is currently in hiding in the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk. 

Last month, Ukraine's prosecutor general said it had documented at least 273 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) who had been executed by Russia during their captivity, a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. 

Kyiv and the U.N. have raised the alarm over rising numbers of executions of POWs, saying they point to a systematic policy by Russia to murder Ukrainian captives. Half of the documented cases were recorded this year alone.

The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine confirmed in March growing numbers of incidents in which Russian forces killed or maimed surrendering Ukrainian troops. Multiple intelligence reports suggest that Russian soldiers have received explicit orders to kill prisoners of war.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, center left, and his wife Kim Hea Kyung, center right, arrive at the Haneda airport in Tokyo, Japan, Saturday.è¨ìáåíàÍòY/The Associated Press

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, in his first full summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in Tokyo on Saturday, stressed the importance of setting aside differences and cooperating in common areas as the leaders showcased their efforts to develop friendly ties.

The neighbors face common challenges from the United States, their mutual ally, and Lee's visit to Japan may help him prepare for his crucial first summit in Washington on Aug. 25 with U.S. President Donald Trump, mainly on trade and defense issues.

Japan and South Korea can cooperate in many areas, but also have conflicts because they are so geographically close, Lee said.

At a time when global trade and security are shaken, it is more important than ever for the two countries with shared principles to cooperate, he added, calling for increased dialogue through “shuttle diplomacy.”

His Tokyo visit before Washington is well received by Japanese officials who see it as a sign Lee is placing great importance to relations between the two neighbors whose ties have repeatedly been disrupted by historical disputes, hampering their trilateral coordination with Washington.

Noting Lee's trip to Tokyo is the first destination of his foreign trip since taking office in June, Ishiba welcomed the South Korean president's arrival at the Prime Minister's Office and posted photos on social media platform X.

The two leaders first met in a closed, small group of officials before summit talks with expanded groups.

For Ishiba, who faces pressure from rightwing rivals within his governing party to resign over its July election loss, Lee's visit and a successful summit could shore up his support.

Japan's PM vows to stay as ruling party loses majority and far-right surges

Rintaro Nishimura, an associate with The Asia Group's Japan branch, said the timing of Lee's visit shows “his way of pragmatic diplomacy” with a focus both on bilateral and trilateral relations with the U.S.

“Obviously tariffs play a big part, but I also think it was a gesture from Lee to show that Japan is very important in his mind as a partner in his foreign policy,” he said.

For the two leaders, who last met only on the sidelines of the G7 summit in June, Saturday's talks are largely symbolic and aimed at highlighting their friendship and focusing on exchanges as this year also marks the 60th anniversary of normalizing their diplomatic ties, he said.

Possible outcomes of the meeting include fast-track entry visas for South Korean travelers and working holiday programs.

The two leaders are also expected to discuss mutual concerns including North Korea's nuclear and missile development and China's growing assertiveness in the region.

Ishiba, who met Trump in Washington in February and held talks with him at the June G7 summit, has settled a tariffs deal ahead of South Korea, enabling him to coordinate with Lee ahead of his summit in the U.S.

The summit comes just days after the two leaders signaled their conciliatory approach to each other.

In his Aug. 15 address marking the liberation from Japan's 1910-1945 colonization of the Korean Peninsula, Lee called for the two sides to overcome grievances rooted in Japan's brutal rule and develop future-oriented ties, though he urged Tokyo to face the issues that remain unresolved and strive to maintain trust.

In an interview with Japan's conservative Yomiuri newspaper published Thursday, Lee also said he will stick to past agreements with the Japanese government on the forced labor issues and sexual abuses of the so-called “comfort women,” though hard feelings remain among many Koreans.

Ishiba, who has acknowledged Japan's wartime aggression and shown empathy toward Asian victims, expressed “remorse” over the war, which he called a mistake, restoring the word in a Japanese leader's Aug. 15 surrender anniversary address for the first time since its 2013 removal by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

The Nobel laureate says few talented people enter politics today, leaving us with ‘the dregs'

Lech Walesa is fixed in the popular imagination as a Cold War hero: the mustachioed electrician who won the Nobel Peace Prize, led Poland out of communism and went on to become its first democratically elected president in decades.

Today, as Mr. Walesa approaches his 82nd birthday, his iconic mustache has turned white and his left arm rests in a sling as he recovers from shoulder surgery. But despite his advancing age – or, perhaps, because of it – Mr. Walesa isn't slowing down. He's plagued by a sense of urgency, a need to do what he can to help preserve democracy, before it's too late.

Ahead of a North American speaking tour that will include stops in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, Mr. Walesa sat down with The Globe and Mail last month for a wide-ranging interview to discuss the decline of democracy, the rise of populism and what could finally put an end to the war in Ukraine.

“People don't believe in democracy. They don't defend democracy,” he said, seated at a long wooden table in his office on the second floor of the European Solidarity Centre in Gdansk. On the wall to his left hung images of da Vinci's The Last Supper and John Paul II, the late Polish pope who had been a strong proponent of Polish independence.

“And why did this happen? Because we've developed the media, television, the internet and so on,” said the former president.

In recent years, social media has polarized people and fuelled the spread of misinformation, which has eroded public trust in institutions and in democracy. 

“Even if there were a prophet today with the best ideas, people wouldn't listen to him because we don't trust each other,” Mr. Walesa said. 

Negative public perceptions of politics and politicians have meanwhile deterred many smart, capable people from running for office, according to Mr. Walesa. While there are a handful of good politicians, many of those who end up in power are “the dregs,” he said.

“That's why things are as they are,” he said, adding: “When will we wake up? When will successful and talented people get involved? Who will oppose demagoguery and populism, because it's here again, winning, today.” 

Mr. Walesa has retained the fashion sensibilities of his blue-collar background: He is dressed, quite literally, in a light-blue collared shirt decorated with an image of Mary (he's a devout Catholic) and a Ukrainian flag pin, his black pants held up by suspenders. 

Changing the course of future events could be as simple as taking a page from the history books, he contends. The Solidarity movement that Mr. Walesa became the public face of in the 1980s defeated communism not through violence but with ideas. Polish dissidents bucked censorship laws to sway public opinion and unite Poles across class lines behind a common cause: a free, independent Poland.

“Solidarity developed its own methods of fighting, which is why we won,” Mr. Walesa said. Those same techniques are needed today, he added.

Mr. Walesa's rise to prominence from his humble upbringing in Popowo, a village in the north-central part of Poland, is chronicled in his 1987 autobiography, A Way of Hope. 

His ancestor Mateusz came to Poland some time near the end of the 18th or beginning of the 19th century with a considerable fortune, which he'd most likely amassed in France. But Mr. Walesa's grandfather gambled away his family's wealth and sold off most of their land, plunging them into poverty.

Mr. Walesa, the son of a carpenter, left home in 1959 to attend a vocational school in the nearby town of Lipno. In 1967, upon arriving in Gdansk, a city on Poland's Baltic Coast, he started working as an electrician at what was then called the Lenin Shipyard.

It wasn't long after his arrival that he met his future wife, Danuta. He'd been passing by a flower stand when he became captivated by the mischievous brown eyes of the woman working there. He asked her out a few days later, and within months they were married.

In December, 1970, several weeks after the birth of the couple's first of eight children, demonstrations broke out at the shipyard, as well as other workplaces in the region, in response to the state's decision to hike food prices. Mr. Walesa's natural propensity for galvanizing a crowd thrust him into a leadership role. The strikes were unsuccessful, however; police and the military were called in to quash them, and dozens of protesters were shot and killed.

Mr. Walesa was eventually dismissed from the yard for his anti-establishment activities, including taking part in efforts to commemorate the victims of the 1970 strikes. In 1980, when another occupation strike broke out at the Gdansk shipyard, Mr. Walesa, who had been banned from the site, had to scale a wall to join the action. He became the group's ringleader and successfully negotiated a number of concessions from the government, including, most crucially, the creation of an independent free trade union known as Solidarnosc, or Solidarity. 

Things took a turn for the worse in December, 1981, when martial law was declared. Overnight, tanks and soldiers appeared in Poland's streets, communication lines were cut, and leaders of the Solidarity trade union were arrested. Mr. Walesa was interned for almost a year.

He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 for his role in the “non-violent struggle for free trade unions and human rights in Poland,“ but, fearing he would be barred from re-entering Poland if he left, had his wife collect the prize on his behalf. By that point, he had become an international celebrity; then-U.S. president Ronald Reagan hailed the decision to award him the Nobel as a ”triumph of moral force over brute force.""

Finally, in 1989, during a period of growing social unrest and amid yet another series of strikes, the Polish government entered into round-table negotiations with Solidarity. Mr. Walesa and his colleagues managed to secure the country's first semi-free elections, in which the trade union was hugely successful. 

The following year, Mr. Walesa ran for the newly established office of Polish president on the slogan “I don't want to, but I have to.” He won handily and oversaw a difficult period of economic transformation for the country. But his presidency was controversial and he was defeated after one term – long enough, though, to see the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 

British historian Timothy Garton Ash described Mr. Walesa in Time magazine as “someone who was magnificent in the struggle for freedom but less so in more normal times.” However, “no one can deny him his place in history.”

Today, the European Solidarity Centre, a museum and library devoted to Solidarity's history, is housed in a massive building next to the shipyard where the workers' movement has its roots. Its red-brown walls are meant to evoke the rusted hulls of ships. 

“In its day, Solidarity set an example of how to fight and win,” said Mr. Walesa, who was joined during the interview by his eldest son, Bogdan.

Mr. Walesa believes that some of Solidarity's tactics could be employed to end the war in Ukraine. The key to defeating Russia, he suggests, lies not in armed combat but in speaking directly to Russians about the consequences of the invasion.

“Even if we help Ukraine beat Russia, Russia will recover in 10 to 20 years, and our grandchildren will have to fight Russia,” Mr. Walesa said. 

Instead, he suggests creating – and widely publicizing – a list of all the Russians who have perished in the war.

The toll of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a closely guarded state secret, but various sources estimate that more than a million Russians have been killed or wounded. Generous payouts and an extensive propaganda campaign have kept many grieving relatives onside, according to The Guardian.

“The entire problem is that it's not about Putin, it's not about Stalin. It is the political system that causes this banditry,” Mr. Walesa said, adding, “We must help Russia change its system.”

Unsurprisingly, the Nobel laureate isn't a proponent of Germany's approach. Since the war began, the European Union's largest economy has significantly boosted its defence spending, an investment that Mr. Walesa calls “pointless” and “a bad idea.” There are already enough weapons in existence to destroy the world “10 times over,” he said. “Why the hell make it 11?”

Ultimately, he believes that the key to solving many of society's problems lies in overhauling democracies, not just in Poland but around the world.

“We have a democracy that was good for the times of Churchill,” he said. “It was okay, but for a different time.”

He suggests two-term limits of no longer than five years each, full transparency around campaign financing and the option to recall any elected official by collecting more signatures than the number of votes that elected them in the first place. “If you do all that, in 10 to 20 years' time, people will return to democracy,” he said.

At stake is nothing less than the survival of civilization.

“The question is whether we will do something,” he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Germany debates sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine","https://www.dw.com/en/russia-ukraine-war-germany-military-peacekeeping-debate/a-73730884","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 08:01:10 GMT","

There is no sign that Russia's aggression in Ukraine is coming to an end, but Germany is already debating whether the Bundeswehr should participate in peacekeeping forces.

Will there soon be a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as suggested by US President Donald Trump? And if the two can indeed agree on a way to end Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine, what will Germany's role be?

These questions have triggered much controversy in political circles in Berlin over the past week.

Politicians have been arguing about whether Germany might send soldiers for a possible peacekeeping force — an international force deployed in the country itself to ensure that fighting does not resume.

Many have said Germany could hardly be absent from such a force, especially with Chancellor Friedrich Merz insisting that Germany have a strong voice in international conflicts. But first and foremost, according to Merz, Germany should focus on the key issue of significantly strengthening the Ukrainian military to deter Russia from launching new attacks after a peace agreement has been reached.

This is in line with a statement made by US Vice President JD Vance on Fox News on August 20 that Europe must take the ""lion's share"" of any conceivable security guarantees.

However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has termed the deployment of European forces in Ukraine as ""completely unacceptable.""

Even in Germany, it seems clear that it will not be easy for Merz to obtain approval for such a force.

Merz's junior coalition partner in government, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), have warned against hasty moves. SPD leader Lars Klingbeiltold Sat.1 television that it would be good if serious talks could occur now.

Of course, Ukraine needs the security of knowing it will not be attacked again, Klingbeil said. ""First and foremost, this requires a strong Ukrainian army. Then, we will see what else can be done. But whether or not German soldiers could be involved is not the question at the moment,"" he said.

German voters, apparently, agree: In a survey conducted by pollster Civey on behalf of German internet portal web.de, 51% of respondents were opposed to a German participation in a peace mission in Ukraine. Only 36% said they thought it would be the right thing to do.

Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, a member of Merz's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has also expressed caution. Wadephul told Table Media that a mission in Ukraine would ""probably overwhelm"" Germany. He said that setting up the Bundeswehr combat brigade in Lithuania is already placing a massive strain on the military.

In an interview with DW, Wadephul expressed skepticism about whether peace talks could even take place. ""Everyone is now waiting for Vladimir Putin to be truly serious about holding talks to end this war. Unfortunately, the situation on the battlefield still looks completely different,"" he said on August 20.

Following the meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington on August 18, Chancellor Merz struck a different tone. Regarding the possible peace process, he said that ""we, as the Federal Republic of Germany, have a keen interest and a great responsibility to participate.""

But of course, he added, this would then also have to be discussed within his coalition government, ""including the question of whether we may have to make decisions that require a mandate."" Every time the Bundeswehr is deployed abroad, the majority of lawmakers in the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, must vote in favor.

Since then, politicians from all political parties have been speaking out daily on the idea of deploying troops to Ukraine. Most of them are skeptical or flat-out opposed. Almost all of them point out that any decision on this matter is still a long way off.

Politicians from eastern Germany are especially opposed to the plan. There, both left-wing and right-wing parties, such as the socialist Left Party and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), are particularly vehement in their rejection of such an idea.

Michael Kretschmer (CDU), who heads a minority government in the eastern state of Saxony, where the AfD is very strong, is one of the strongest voices of opposition within Merz's party. ""German soldiers fighting in Ukraine must not be an option,"" Kretschmer said this week.

Johannes Winkel, the head of the CDU's youth organization, Junge Union, took a very different view. ""We can't say on the one hand that we need to reduce our dependence on the US military and that Europe finally has to grow up, and on the other hand refuse to take responsibility when it becomes concrete for the first time,"" he told the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland on August 21.

The Green Party has expressed skepticism over the results of the Ukraine summit in Washington. ""No substantial progress has been made,"" Omid Nouripour, the Greens' foreign policy expert, said in a TV interview with RTL and ntv on August 19. He urged Europe to build up its own protection forces to enable them to give security guarantees to Ukraine even without involving the US.

Left Party leader Jan van Aken suggested a UN peacekeeping force of 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers as a security guarantee for Ukraine. He said it would be important for China to participate ""because Russian soldiers would not shoot at Chinese soldiers."" However, he also warned that the involvement of German troops could be reminiscent of events in World War II, when the German army invaded Russia.

AfD leader Alice Weidel warned that Germany could itself become a target and demanded: ""Germany needs reconciliation with Russia instead of constant confrontation.""

Meanwhile, Wolfgang Ischinger, the long-standing head of the Munich Security Conference, wrote on X: ""There is not a single indication that President Putin is prepared to end this war at the moment."" Many observers in Germany agree.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Racist Berlin street name changed after legal battle","https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-racist-street-name-change-stopped-again-mohrenstra%C3%9Fe-anton-wilhelm-amo-stra%C3%9Fe/a-73280857","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 15:04:07 GMT","

The renaming of a Berlin boulevard to Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse, after Germany's first Africa-born scholar, has finally happened despite a last-ditch legal attempt to stop it.

""Decolonization does not happen by changing a few street names,"" political scientist and human rights activist Joshua Kwesi Aikins told DW on Friday, ahead of an event to rename a central Berlin street in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Black German Enlightenment philosopher, who in 1734 became the first Africa-born scholar to receive a European doctorate.

The decision was first announced in 2020. At the time, the district council of Berlin-Mitte approved the renaming — but before it was implemented, residents filed a lawsuit against the change.

But five years later, in July 2025, the Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg upheld a decision by the Berlin Administrative Court stating that residents have no basis to take legal action against the name change.

The change was made official with a symbolic unveiling on August 23, which also marks International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. The group ""Pro Mohrenstrasse"" made a last-ditch legal attempt to block the name change in August, but the Berlin-Brandenburg court again upheld its ruling to allow for the name change.

Several civil society groups have lobbied for decades to change the name of Mohren or ""Moor"" Street (respectfully referred to as M-Strasse), and the U-Bahn station of the same name.

Moor, in its Greek roots, means dark or black, but also ""stupid or primitive,"" Aikins said.

M-Strasse runs through the old quarter of the former Prussian city, steps away from the rebuilt Berlin Palace, which oversaw colonial forays into Africa. It also passes near the former chancellor's residence and venue for the 1884-1885 Berlin Conference, where European leaders ""discussed how they might divide up Africa,"" in the words of Berlin-based British-Ugandan writer Musa Okwonga. That conference kick-started Germany's genocidal colonial rule in Namibia.

The M-word's overt racist connotations further derive from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany as ""court moors"" to work as servants or entertain the Brandenburg electors and Prussian kings as musicians.

""The street name given at the beginning of the 18th century transports this racist experience of violence against Black people in Berlin to the present day,"" wrote historian Christian Kopp of Decolonize Berlin-Mitte.

These slaves were mostly brought from the Brandenburg-Prussian colony in current-day Ghana (then known as the Brandenburger Gold Coast), which existed from 1682 to 1721.

Anton Wilhelm Amo was enslaved as a boy in Ghana and taken to Amsterdam around 1703. He was then gifted to the German Duke of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel in 1707, the year M-Strasse was named.

Encouraged to study by the duke, who paid for his education, Amo went on to become the first Africa-born scholar in Europe to complete a doctorate in 1734.

Despite Amo's displacement, he embraced his German identity while never forgetting his African heritage. Amo's thesis in law at the University of Halle is lost but was titled ""The Rights of Blacks in Europe,"" and looked at the legal rights of people of color on the continent.

Amo is said to have learned six languages. He later wrote a second doctoral thesis in philosophy that weighed in on philosopher Rene Descartes and his ideas about the duality between mind and body. He also taught classes at the universities in Halle and nearby Jena, but made a meager living before returning to Ghana in 1747. The date of his death is unknown.

Amo is remembered as the first philosopher of African origin in Germany, yet this trailblazer has been largely erased from European intellectual history.

The naming of Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse demands a greater appreciation of the scholar's work ""as a philosopher and legal scholar, and the professional context in which he worked,"" wrote Anna Orinsky in the online journal, EUIdeas in February 2022. ""German and international historians, philosophers and scholars of many other disciplines are called upon to analyse Amo's work."" 

But the renaming is also in honor of a symbol of Black resistance, said Andrea-Vicky Amankwaa-Birago, a Berlin-based cultural scientist focused on decolonization across Germany and Ghana.

""This renaming signals a change in how we remember — placing Black history, achievement, and resilience at the center,"" she wrote in August 2025 for internet publication, Medium.  

The M-Strasse subway station was itself renamed in 1991, in the wake of reunification. It had previously been called Otto-Grotewohl-Strasse after an East German politician.

The use of the racist name was called out at the time by the pioneering Black German activist May Ayim, a poet of Ghanaian descent who co-founded the Initiative of Black People in Germany in 1986 and edited the defining book ""Showing Our Colors: Afro-German Women Speak Out."" 

Ayim pursued her efforts to reveal the coded racism in reunified Germany. In the 1990s, she was outspoken in her opposition to the street name, which in her view stood for the fact that Germany's Black community was not included in the country's essentially white reunification process after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

In 2010, a Kreuzberg riverfront was renamed after Ayim, who died in 1996. It was one of the first acts of decolonization, the shore having been named after Otto Friedrich von der Groeben, who in the late 17th century founded the Brandenburg-Prussian colony in Ghana.

A week after Donald Trump applauded Vladimir Putin down the red carpet in Alaska, and days after an unprecedented summit of European leaders at the White House, the American president came crashing down to earth on Friday.

“I'm not happy about it, and I'm not happy about anything having to do with that war,” he told reporters who asked about an American factory in Ukraine being hit by a Russian strike.

For all the pomp and pageantry, spectacles and summitry of the past week, analysts say the underlying reality of the war has not changed.

Russia is still bombing Ukraine and in the past few days Moscow has put up more roadblocks to peace.

A summit between Russian and Ukrainian leaders seems as far away as ever.

The question now is whether the summit in Alaska and the gathering at the White House could still be the start of a long, grinding path towards peace, or whether spectacle is no substitute for substance.

“I don't know. I'm really not sure,” said a retired senior State Department official. “It's been one step backwards and one step forwards.”

Last Friday, Mr Trump made an effort to kickstart talks by meeting Putin in Alaska. On Monday, Volodomyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, came to the White House, accompanied by six European leaders.

Mr Trump appeared willing to offer US security guarantees for Ukraine, if a peace deal could be struck. That was a major step forward for Kyiv and its European allies.

And he even said that Putin agreed to accept security guarantees.

Mr Trump's optimism was caught on a hot mic on Monday.

“I think he wants to make a deal for me, you understand, as crazy as it sounds,” he told Emmanuel Macron, the French president.

Leaders in the room – including Sir Keir Starmer, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Germany's Friedrich Merz and Finland's Alexander Stubb – came away thinking they had done enough to cancel out any advantage Putin might have gained, and enthused about the way that Mr Trump was committed to the process.

A senior European diplomat said Mr Trump had “placed his hand in the mangle”.

“He's invested political capital in reaching a deal and committed to the US making a contribution to security guarantees,” he said.

But since then, Mr Trump has rowed back on any suggestion of American troops taking part in a security force.

And Russia made clear that any security guarantees would be subject to a Russian veto – a rather more complicated position than Mr Trump announced after Alaska.

Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said: “Moscow won't agree with collective security guarantees negotiated without Russia …

“Russia will accept if the security guarantees to Ukraine are provided on equal basis with the participation of countries like China, the United States, the United Kingdom and France.”

John Herbst, former US ambassador to Ukraine, said the Trump administration had made a serious tactical error earlier in the month when it ditched a deadline for secondary sanctions and began planning for the Alaska summit.

“They pivoted from pressure on Russia to talking to Russia about their supposed flexibility right now,” he said. “This was not a good look from the very beginning, because you don't let your red lines fall to the side.”

However, the historic assembly of European leaders on Monday meant Putin was not having it all his own way, added Mr Herbst.

“All the Europeans showing up was critical. Trump has really good relations with Stubb and Meloni, and good relations with Starmer and Macron and Merz. And so that means his friendliness to Putin is offset by this,” he said.

“You didn't have it to this degree at any time in the first term. That's an important factor.”

Even so, Russia flexed its military muscle on Wednesday night, launching a rare drone and missile strike on Western Ukraine and hitting targets that included an American-owned electronics plant.

Mr Trump responded with a cryptic social media post.

“It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader's country,” he posted on Truth Social, blasting his predecessor for limiting Ukraine's ability to hit at Russia.

Was he announcing a significant shift in policy, urging Kyiv to take the war to Russian soil? Or was it a sign of frustration as hopes of breakthrough evaporated almost as quickly as they had emerged?

“It's just an observation,” said Steven Cheung, White House communications director. “Don't read too much into it.”

A day later, Mr Trump gave a clearer outline of his plan, or lack of one, falling back on one of his favourite stalling techniques – the two-week deadline.

“We'll see what happens,” he said of the war. “I think over the next two weeks, we're going to find out which way it's going to go. And I better be very happy.”

Prominent anti-abortion operatives are deeply entangled in the lawsuit filed this August by a woman in Texas.

Texas has long served as a testing ground for new ways to restrict abortion, and with a new lawsuit, it is once again forging new avenues for repression.

A Texas woman filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against a man she alleges covertly slipped medication abortion into her hot chocolate. According to text messages cited in the complaint, she claims that her next-door-neighbor pressured her to have an abortion that she did not want and threatened to testify against her in her ongoing custody battle with her allegedly abusive, soon-to-be ex-husband.

Let's be clear about this: reproductive coercion is abuse. It's seldom talked about, but it is serious and unconscionable. If what this woman alleges is true, that someone gave her medication abortion without her knowledge, that's a crime and she obviously has grounds to try to bring that perpetrator to some form of justice.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

But reporting from Garnet Henderson at Autonomy News peels back the layers of this case and allows us to see what's going on underneath.

The plaintiff is represented by former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, the architect of SB8, Texas' notorious bounty-hunter abortion ban. Mitchell is an anti-abortion fanatic; in addition to conceptualizing SB8, he has also represented men in filing suits against their former partners for having an abortion. Mitchell has embraced using the Comstock Law, an 1873 law that made it a felony to share contraceptives, abortifacients and information about either across state lines or through the mail, as a backdoor way to institute a federal abortion ban. The suit was announced on social media by Mitchell's compatriot Mark Lee Dickson, the leader of the so-called “sanctuary cities for the unborn” movement that emboldens individual cities and towns to ban abortion within their limits.

The involvement of Mitchell and Dickson in this case makes it difficult to take this lawsuit as a good-faith effort to defend a woman's autonomy. These men aren't neutral arbiters — they are intentional, anti-abortion actors who both have years of experience creating new and innovative ways to undermine abortion access.

Not only that, but the anti-abortion movement has long treated women instrumentally, manipulating them and sometimes preying on their troubles to weaponize them against abortion.

Fifty years ago, in August of 1975, two male abortion opponents — Burke Balch and Thomas Mooney — executed their plan to shut down Sigma Reproductive Health Services in Rockville, Maryland. Concerned about the optics of two men impeding an abortion clinic, they instead recruited six women whom they trained to enter the clinic under the guise of being patients, and then to sit down and refuse to leave. It was the first blockade of an abortion clinic in U.S. history, and the six women were arrested. The men responsible for the chaos were not.

Then there's the case of “Jane Roe” herself, Norma McCorvey, the woman behind the landmark Roe v. Wade case that established the constitutional right to abortion in 1973. McCorvey went on to become a prominent anti-abortion spokeswoman, trotted out by abortion opponents at every turn, to deride the right associated with her name. But on her deathbed, McCorvey finally came clean — it was all an act. The anti-abortion forces used her, plying her with money and psychological manipulation, to speak out against abortion.

Abortion opponents have shown time and again that they are willing to lie, to deceive, and to manipulate, in order to curtail abortion rights.

But this lawsuit goes one step further. The woman is also suing Aid Access, a nonprofit organization that allows abortion seekers to purchase medication abortion online and have it shipped directly to their homes. The woman claims that the defendant showed her a receipt from Aid Access on his phone. Filing a wrongful death suit against Aid Access and its founder, Rebecca Gomperts, is a backdoor attempt to eliminate online access to medication abortion — a sideways attack on a provider who is supposedly protected by shield laws.

That may be the whole point of this. So far, extradition requests from Texas lawmakers against abortion providers in shield states have gone nowhere. Now, it looks as if Mitchell, the ever-creative architect of backdoor abortion bans, has found a potentially new way to eradicate access to a major online provider of medication abortion. Instead of claiming a violation of Texas's total abortion ban, Mitchell is now trying to claim wrongful death on behalf of an individual with the ultimate goal of shutting down Aid Access.

Even if it doesn't work that cleanly, this lawsuit could cause a chilling effect. It could frighten other telehealth providers away from prescribing medication abortion online to folks in banned states. If found guilty of “wrongful death,” abortion providers could be forced to pay an exorbitant amount, even though that charge is not a criminal offense. And while the lawsuit can't  technically “ban” medication abortion, it could still make it even harder for folks in banned states to covertly access it through safe means.

For now, we will have to wait and see how this lawsuit plays out. But in the meantime, anti-abortion fanatics like Mitchell and Dickson will continue to find increasingly clever and absurd ways to shut down access to abortion. I fear this is only the beginning.

After assaults on Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., Trump appears to be eyeing Chicago as another target.

US President Donald Trump said Friday that Chicago is the next city in his crosshairs for the kind of federal invasion and occupation currently underway in Washington, D.C. — a threat that sparked defiant pushback from officials in the Windy City and beyond.

“After we do this, we'll go to another location, and we'll make it safe also,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, referring to his federalization of Washington's Metropolitan Police Department and deployment of National Guard troops from the district and five Republican-controlled states.

“We're going to make our cities very, very safe. Chicago's a mess. You have an incompetent mayor. Grossly incompetent and we'll straighten that one out probably next,” the president said, referring to progressive Brandon Johnson. “That will be our next one after this. And it won't even be tough.”

On August 11, Trump dubiously declared a public safety emergency in Washington, D.C., despite violent crime being down 26% from a year ago, when it was at its second-lowest level since 1966, according to official statistics. Critics have noted that Trump's crackdown isn't just targeting criminals, but also unhoused and mentally ill people, who have had their homes destroyed and property taken.

On Friday, Trump threatened to completely take over Washington and oust Mayor Muriel Bowser if she does not stop pointing out that crime has decreased in the city, which the president called a “crime-infested rat hole.”

In addition to Chicago, Trump has threatened to send federal forces into cities including Baltimore, Los Angeles, New York, Oakland, and San Francisco. Violent crime is trending downward in all of those cities — with some registering historically low levels.

Unlike in Washington, D.C., where home rule laws allow the federal government to take control of local police, Trump would face greater obstacles to intervention in other cities.

“President Trump can't seize control of the Chicago police or any other local department outside of DC,” Congressman Raja Krishnamoorth (D-Ill.) noted on social media Friday. “The military cannot and will not patrol the streets of Chicago, and I will work with state and local officials to ensure that doesn't happen.”

Mayor Johnson said in a statement that “the problem with the president's approach is that it is uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound.”

“If the Trump administration is serious about driving down violence in Chicago, or anywhere else in America, then he should not have taken over $800 million away from violence prevention,” he added.

Other elected officials in Illinois also expressed anger and alarm at the prospect of a Trump intervention in Chicago.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul issued the following statement in response to comments President Trump made today threatening to deploy federal law enforcement to perform civilian law enforcement duties in the city of Chicago: tinyurl.com/5n89nt86

“After using Los Angeles and Washington, DC as his testing ground for authoritarian overreach, Trump is now openly flirting with the idea of taking over other states and cities,” Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said on X.

“Trump's goal is to incite fear in our communities and destabilize existing public safety efforts — all to create a justification to further abuse his power,” the governor continued. “He's playing a game and creating a spectacle for the press to play along with.”

“We don't play those games,” Pritzker added. “Our commitment to law and order is delivering results. Crime rates are improving. Homicides are down by more than 30% in Chicago in the last year alone. Our progress in lowering crime has been made possible with [community violence intervention] programs that they're defunding.”

Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, a Democrat running for U.S. Senate, said that “if Trump wants to take his ego trip on tour, he picked the wrong city.”

“Chicago doesn't bow down to kings or roll out the red carpet for dictators,” she added. “As a Black woman from the South Side, I can assure you… your political circus isn't welcome here.”

Congresswoman Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) wrote on social media, “President Trump: You are not welcome in Chicago.”

“Sending the National Guard endangers Black communities already overpoliced and under-invested in,” she added. “If you cared about saving lives, you'd pass gun safety laws and fund community violence intervention.”

Even as they struggle to access food, art supplies, and shelter, Palestinian artists put the burdens of war on canvas.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

As universities in Gaza resume online teaching after months of suspension due to the ongoing genocide, 25-year-old Mohaned Asayas, a student in the art department at Al-Aqsa University, said he struggled with the practical aspects of his art courses. “This is not only my problem but also that of all my classmates,” he said, “as the war has destroyed most of our studios, made art supplies unaffordable and scarce, and deprived us of a motivational and inspiring space for drawing.”

Asayas thought deeply about a solution to this problem and, with sufficient support from the Palestinian Ministry of Culture, brought his idea to life by launching a workshop he named Aphenix. The initiative offered artists in Gaza a much-needed space to breathe, away from the burdens of war, and provided them with artistic tools to create new works.

Asayas said that through the workshop, 25 artists had the chance to come together for three hours a day in a coffee shop in the heart of Gaza City, creating their own world, laughing, sharing knowledge, and drawing with different materials such as soft charcoal, pastel, and acrylic.

The workshop lasted a month, culminating in an exhibition titled Aphenix,  named after the workshop itself, which was held in July 2025. The exhibition took place in a spacious area inside the same coffee shop that had hosted the workshop, using modest means — wooden pillars and fabrics on which the artworks were displayed. People across Gaza came to see this exhibition and hailed it as the first art exhibition held during the war.

The exhibition aimed to channel the heavy burdens of war onto striking canvases. Each artist produced works that conveyed not only personal stories but also the collective experiences of their people — tales marked by starvation, displacement, relentless bombardment, and profound loss. With a total of 55 pieces, the artists transformed their pain into powerful visual narratives, compelling the world to witness both their suffering and their resilience. 

Bisan Al Amasy, 20, an artist who participated in both the workshop and exhibition, said the harsh circumstances and instability caused by repeated displacement during the war had kept her from drawing until then. “Depression had sapped my energy and focus, and the loss of my studio made creating art even more difficult,” she said.

Al Amasy added that the workshop was the perfect opportunity for her to return to creating art. “It helped lift me out of the difficult mental state I had been struggling with, as I began using art as a way to release the negative energy and intense pressure caused by the war,” she said.

Al Amasy worked on two paintings for the exhibition. In each, she said she relied on soft charcoal for drawing, in addition to her own style characterized by random lines and sudden strokes as a way of expressing the inner confusion and psychological turmoil she carries inside.

In her first painting, Al Amasy depicted Gaza City, exhausted by war, as a donkey showing signs of psychological and physical fatigue, as well as hunger. She explained that, in this work, she burdened the donkey with weights beyond its capacity — symbolizing the killing, international silence, and displacement that Gaza City has endured since the beginning of the war. She added that her choice of the donkey, in particular, reflects the animal's inseparable role in daily life, as it transports people and goods, carries the injured and the dying to hospitals, and shares in the same hardships as the people.

In her second painting, Al Amasy sought to shed light on the famine gripping Gaza. She explained that in her work, she tried to depict pale faces and emaciated bodies gazing at the sky in search of a glimmer of hope, reflecting the dire situation of the residents of the Gaza Strip.

Inas Rayan, 22, a visual artist, also said her participation in the Aphenix project increased her confidence and helped her return to the creative world where she belongs after she had struggled with feeling lost and unsure of herself, especially following her father's killing and the destruction of her home during the Israeli ground invasion of Jabalia refugee camp.

Rayan said that before the war began, she loved to draw with bright colors, creating paintings full of life and optimism. However, after the war, she noticed that her artistic vision had changed significantly. She now has begun to draw with darker colors, depicting scenes of destruction and loss in an attempt to convey the suffering and pain of her people.

Rayan presented three artworks at the exhibition, including a powerful piece that told the story of a young boy named Mohamed, who lost his father in the war. Through this work, Rayan highlights the harsh reality faced by children in Gaza, where the loss of the family's primary provider forces them to shoulder adult burdens far too soon. At an age when they should be playing, learning, and dreaming of a bright future, these children are instead compelled to care for their families while coping with profound loss.

Fadal Tafish, 30, an art teacher specializing in acrylic painting, said the Aphenix workshop lifted him from the ashes, allowing him to reclaim even a small part of his life as an artist before the war began. “I was happy to be able to pursue my work as an artist, helping others develop their artistic skills despite all the challenges,” he said.

Tafish also participated in the exhibition, painting an acrylic piece depicting the features of Gaza as the face of an elderly woman, her wrinkles bearing witness to the destruction of homes and the ongoing killings. He explained that he chose the face of an elderly woman to show that the genocide we are living through has taken us back to the era of the Nakba, when our grandparents were displaced from their land under the threat of massacres.

At the same time, Tafish emphasized that the elderly woman's face is one of the symbols Palestinians hold dear. To him, it embodies hope and an unwavering attachment to the Palestinian homeland — a testament that, despite everything, our spirit will not be broken, and we will rise once more to rebuild Gaza.

Despite the immense challenges Asayas and his fellow artists faced in bringing this exhibition to life — hunger, working with only basic tools, transportation difficulties, limited communication due to internet outages, and relentless bombardment — they succeeded in creating something extraordinary, sending a powerful message to the world: We are here, and Gaza is still home to brilliant young talents with bold ideas and unyielding will in the face of devastation.

Melania Trump hadn't been spotted at the White House for more than a month. But as her husband prepared for a high-stakes Alaska summit with his Russian counterpart in pursuit of an end to the war in Ukraine, the first lady was practicing diplomacy.
    


            “Dear President Putin,” she wrote in a direct appeal to the Russian president. “Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation's rustic countryside or a magnificent city-center. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.”
    


            It underscored, those who know and observe the first lady say, the understated but influential role she has played in Donald Trump's second term as president, despite her physical absence from Washington.
    


            The first lady is rarely seen publicly. She did not accompany her husband when he delivered her letter to President Vladimir Putin during last week's summit in Anchorage, nor was she present at the White House days later when he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other European leaders. She's made public appearances just 19 days so far this term, compared to 40 at this point during the previous. Her East Wing staff this time around is a fraction of her first-term team and that of her predecessors.
    


            But Trump is in frequent communication with her husband, often in texts or calls exchanged throughout the day, according to sources familiar with the matter. And much like her husband, the first lady consumes a steady diet of news coverage. By Donald Trump's account, Melania Trump has provided a healthy dose of skepticism after previous conversations with Putin.
    


            “I tell the first lady, ‘You know, I spoke to Vladimir today — we had a wonderful conversation.' She said, ‘Oh, really? Another city was just hit,'” Donald Trump recounted during a July Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
    


            The moment offered a rare window into how the Trumps communicate.
    


            “I think that a lot of people underestimate how normal of a couple they are. … He listens to her and seeks her counsel,” said a source familiar with the dynamic who requested anonymity to speak freely. “She only wades in when she really will go to the paint on something – and she really cares about kids.”
    


            Melania Trump's office did not respond to multiple inquiries from CNN.
    


            In her letter to Putin, Trump obliquely referenced the “darkness” around children impacted by war, telling the Russian leader he has the power to “singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter.”
    


            She did not specifically name Ukraine, but thousands of Ukrainian children have allegedly been abducted by Russia since the war began.
    


            While the president's recent comments about his wife's strong reactions to watching the war unfold on TV have sparked criticism from Russian state media, they've also spawned appreciative “Agent Melania Trumpenko” memes in Ukraine. And after her letter to Putin, Zelensky hand-delivered to Donald Trump a letter from his wife to the US first lady.
    


            Melania Trump hasn't stated any public position on Ukraine or Gaza, but her reactions – as described by the president – have offered a kind of reality check on the wars that he has promised, but has so far failed, to end.
    


            “She thinks it's terrible,” Donald Trump said last month of the images coming out of Gaza, which Israeli Prime Minister Bejamin Netanyahu has denied showed starvation.
    


            “And she sees the same pictures that you see, that we all see. And I think everybody, unless they're pretty cold-hearted — or worse than that, nuts — there's nothing you can say other than it's terrible when you see the kids.”
    


            The common thread has been the threat to children.
    


            “Mrs. Trump has been consistent in her focus on the safety of children and their future,” said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush and director of American University's Legacies of America's First Ladies Initiative.
    


            Melania Trump also approached her Putin letter from her unique background: she was born in what was then communist Yugoslavia in 1970.
    


            “She brings another level of credibility having grown up in a Europe under the control of Russian aggression before successfully gaining their country's freedom,” McBride added.
    


            And her engagement is not without precedent: McBride noted that Nancy Reagan spoke directly to Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev to seek peace and wrote to his wife on the eve of a key meeting. Jackie Kennedy wrote to Soviet Union Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev expressing hope for peace after her husband's death. And Laura Bush addressed reporters in the White House briefing room, admonishing the regime in Myanmar after a deadly cyclone.
    


            “First ladies have a unique moral authority. … I applaud Mrs. Trump for using her platform this way on things that are important – especially in this critical moment in world history,” McBride said.
    


            Issues related to children have also motivated Trump's limited involvement in domestic policy — from advocating for legislation against deepfake and revenge pornography to a $25 million investment for foster youth that the White House says she secured in the president's budget. That interest has also shaped where she's chosen to embrace the public role of first lady. Last month, for example, she comforted young girls impacted by catastrophic flooding in Texas Hill Country, where she was gifted a friendship bracelet and prayed with campers.
    


            “She genuinely does care about tragedy and things that have involved children. I believe in her authenticity when she does participate,” said Kate Bennett, a former CNN journalist who covered the first lady and author of “Free, Melania.”
    


            Still, Trump's use of her massive platform is selective – marking a departure from most of her predecessors.
    


            “People expect or anticipate there will be a participation on behalf of the first lady of the United States, no matter who is in the office, no matter what political party,” Bennett said.
    


            “It is patently clear that for Melania Trump, at least for now, this has been a pick-and-choose kind of role.”
    


            A key part of that choice, this time around, has been a relative absence from Washington.
    


            Trump splits her time between New York and Palm Beach, with weekslong gaps between her trips to the nation's capital. Her last known White House appearance was July 11 as she departed with the president for a trip to Texas.
    


            During her husband's first term, she didn't announce her full-time White House residency until June of 2017. This year, with son Barron in college at New York University, her appearances have been far less regular.
    


            She has stood by her husband's side at more than a dozen public events, joined him on a pair of tours after extreme weather damage, and held three solo events. But she's been seen in public less than half of the days she was at this same point in the president's first term, when she'd attended multiple Oval Office meetings and news conferences with world leaders and made trips to seven countries.
    


            And she's skipped the kinds of symbolic moments traditionally attended by her predecessors, like a flagpole unveiling and magnolia planting on White House grounds. Her husband has even overseen the renovation of a reimagined, paved Rose Garden, and the West Wing unilaterally announced plans for a $200 million East Wing ballroom expansion that will directly impact the first lady team's office space.
    


            “I don't think it's anything interpersonal,” the source familiar told CNN, adding, “It's just – she's not interested” in the trappings of the role.
    


            She's gone to significant lengths to protect her reputation in recent weeks, threatening legal action against those who have tried to tie her to Jeffrey Epstein and earning a retraction and apology from the Daily Beast.
    


            In Washington, she employs a skeletal staff compared to her first-term team of approximately 11 staffers.
    


            As of July 1, the first lady had five full-time staff members, according to a report sent to Congress, whose salaries totaled $634,200 per year. One key role, the White House social secretary, who plans and coordinates all official and personal social White House events, remains unfilled.
    


            A similar report sent July 1, 2024, reflected more than 20 staffers working in first lady Jill Biden's office, with their salaries totaling nearly $2.5 million per year. Michelle Obama had 12 full-time staffers in July 2016.
    


            In a rare interview with Fox News before her husband's return to office, Melania Trump said she didn't want to “rush in” to hiring and wanted to ensure her employees are “serving me,” not their own agenda — perhaps reflecting some apprehension after key staffers resigned in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
    


            That hesitancy could stem from a series of public betrayals by former staffers, including Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former longtime friend and senior adviser who secretly recorded tapes of the first lady and wrote a memoir about their relationship.
    


            Onetime chief of staff Stephanie Grisham, who resigned on January 6, testified before the House panel investigating the attack and went on to endorse Kamala Harris at the 2024 Democratic National Convention.
    


            But without a substantial staff, Trump has yet to lay out any new policy goals or expansion of her first-term “Be Best” campaign. She has not participated in any solo foreign or domestic travel. She has not announced plans for any official state visits to the White House.
    


            Still, her recent – albeit indirect – comments about two intractable conflicts have offered hints of her influence.
    


            “When she speaks, people do listen – and whether or not that's because it's so infrequent, I'm unsure, but she definitely has a platform. She should lean into that,” the source familiar said.

            Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, has rocketed past his rivals in fundraising, bringing in a little more than $1 million in recent weeks, according to new campaign reports filed Friday.
    


            Mamdani's haul far exceeds the $425,000 raised by the city's embattled incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is waging a long-shot independent bid for a second term, and that of former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who raised a little more than $507,000 since relaunching his campaign in July after his bruising primary loss to Mamdani.
    


            In one sign of the former governor's financial challenge, Cuomo also opted to transfer more than $68,000 from a state campaign account to help build his coffers for the city contest.
    


            The Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa – viewed as a marginal candidate in the deeply Democratic city – raised about $407,000.
    


            The haul by Mamdani between July 12 and August 18 marks an uptick from the roughly $852,000 he collected a month earlier as the democratic socialist shocked the political world by trouncing Cuomo in June's Democratic primary.
    


            Mamdani also has built a substantial war chest – with $4.4 million cash on hand, according to Friday's filings with the New York City Campaign Finance Board. His campaign said it also expects to qualify for more than $2 million in public money under the city's public fund matching program.
    


            In all, more than 8,000 people contributed to Mamdani in roughly five weeks. And about half of his money came from donors who live outside the city, the filings show.
    


            “With over 50,000 volunteers, thousands of small-dollar donors, and genuine enthusiasm for Zohran's vision for a more affordable New York City, our momentum is surging,” Mamdani's campaign spokesperson Dora Pekec said in a statement Friday.
    


            Cuomo, who announced in mid-July that he would continue to mount a general election campaign as a third-party candidate, has about $1.2 million in available cash. His campaign said Friday it is hoping to secure some $525,000 in matching funds.
    


            The city's campaign finance regulators will meet next week to consider the candidates' funding requests.
    


            Adams, meanwhile, has a cash balance of roughly $3.9 million but has been repeatedly denied valuable public funds from the New York campaign board, which has cited its ongoing investigation of his campaign's practices. He recently sued the board over its denial.
    


            Federal prosecutors last year indicted Adams on corruption charges, which the Trump administration has since dropped.  On Friday, Adams insisted he would not abandon his reelection bid, a day after his former chief advisor was accused of accepting thousands of dollars in bribes. The mayor has not been accused of wrongdoing in the case.
    


            Mamdani, who has sharply criticized the role of billionaires in the race, also is benefitting from the support from the family member of a billionaire, recent filings show.
    


            Philanthropist Elizabeth Simons, the daughter of late hedge-fund co-founder James Simons, donated $250,000 earlier this month to a pro-Mamdani super PAC, New Yorkers for Lower Costs. The donation is the largest contribution reported by the group to date.
    


            Super PACs operate independently of candidates' campaigns.
    


            Shortly after winning the Democratic primary in June, Mamdani said he didn't think billionaires should exist. “I don't think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality, and ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country,” Mamdani said on NBC's “Meet the Press” at the time.
    


            A Mamdani campaign official on Friday declined to comment on Simons' donation to the independent group.
    


            Meanwhile, recent bold-faced contributors to a super PAC promoting Cuomo's candidacy include billionaire Walmart heir Alice Walton. Walton contributed $100,000 earlier this month to the pro-Cuomo Fix the City PAC, bringing her total donations to the group to $200,000.
    


            The group spent more than $22 million in the Democratic primary fight.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from jail in Tennessee on Friday so he can rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, according to a Saturday court filing.

The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday, after it was clear that the Salvadoran national would likely be released from a Tennessee jail the following day. Abrego Garcia declined to extend his stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with his family. Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday. 

His attorneys declined to comment on whether the plea offer had been formally rescinded. The brief they filed only said that Abrego Garcia had declined one part of the offer — to remain in jail — and that his attorneys would “communicate the government's proposal to Mr. Abrego.” 

Filed along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face the possibility of detention. An additional benefit of the offer would be that Costa Rica is a Spanish-speaking country, like Abrego Garcia's native El Salvador. Abrego Garcia would only be deported to Costa Rica after serving his sentence on the smuggling charges, according to the brief.

Abrego Garcia's case became a flashpoint in President Donald Trump's immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a judge's earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He has pleaded not guilty and has asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.




“Despite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego's counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office Monday morning,” the brief says, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning. 

A Department of Homeland Security agent later testified that he didn't begin investigating the traffic stop until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. 

Although Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours' notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision. 

“Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.

HOUSTON (AP) — Just as Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Colin Allred was holding a town hall near the Mexican border as part of an “unrig Texas” campaign tour, the state's Democratic fundraising powerhouse Beto O'Rourke rallied support in Austin for lawmakers who left the state to delay a redistricting plan led by President Donald Trump. The next morning, one of those wayward lawmakers, James Talarico, stood in the pulpit at former President Barack Obama's old church in Chicago to say he and his fellow legislators had simply taken a leap of faith.

All three Democrats are either declared or potential contenders for the Senate seat on the ballot in next year's midterm elections. In what would typically be a quiet period in Texas politics, Republicans have roiled the state's 2026 Senate campaign with their rush to redraw congressional maps to give Trump more allies in Congress. The turmoil impacts contenders in both parties and gives Democrats fresh hope that they can capture a long-elusive seat, where an upset would dramatically improve their chances of regaining Senate control in Washington.

For Democrats, the GOP power play offers a new way to stand out as fighters against Trump and his Make America Great Again movement. 

For Republicans, including incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, it's a Trump loyalty test. Cornyn publicly called for involving the FBI in rounding up the defiant Democrats. His main primary challenger, state Attorney General Ken Paxton, used his current office to ask state courts to remove departed lawmakers from office and to jail O'Rourke for raising funds to support the Democratic legislators. The clash has also been a welcome distraction from recent questions about Paxton's private life.




Trump, meanwhile, had his eyes on the U.S. House when he openly prodded Texas Republicans this summer to give him five more GOP seats in a state he won handily last year. He hoped to avoid losing a slim House majority, as he did during his first term in 2018.

Democrats nationwide condemned the effort to alter the playing field, in part because it comes before the typical 10-year timeline for redrawing congressional districts based on census results.

Texas Democrats walked out for two weeks, denying Republicans the quorum they needed. They ended the walkout this week, but only after California Gov. Gavin Newsom countered with a redistricting push in his state, a Democratic stronghold. 

“We've got to stand up to them. These people are thugs,” O'Rourke said in an interview with The Associated Press. “Giving in or seeking compromise, or trying to make concessions in the hopes that they'll stop pursuing you, that stuff clearly does not work. The only thing that works is fighting.”

O'Rourke, a former congressman and onetime presidential candidate who has run and lost against U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, said he has not decided whether he will launch a senatorial bid.

Paxton has assumed the role as the Left's chief antagonist, a good look during a primary campaign aimed at drawing the most devout Republicans. He asked courts to expel the lawmakers who walked out, brought lawsuits to declare their seats vacant and sought to jail O'Rourke, arguably the state's most well-known Democrat, accusing him of illegally raising money to help defray costs for the Democratic lawmakers who left. 

A judge granted a temporary restraining order, ordering O'Rourke to cease and handing Paxton a victory.

“We are pursuing every legal remedy at our disposal to hold these rogue legislators accountable,” Paxton said in a statement. “Texas deserves representatives who do their jobs instead of running away at the behest of their billionaire handlers.”

Cornyn used his federal role to ask the FBI to help bring Democratic lawmakers who fled the state back to Texas.

After first criticizing Paxton for being on vacation in Europe when the redistricting drama began, Cornyn used the moment to question Paxton's tactics.

“It seems like both are doing what each of them can do, given their own public office,” said Roy Bailey, a wealthy Republican donor from Dallas.

Cornyn's own polling shows him trailing Paxton. Cornyn's campaign and groups that support him, including a pro-Cornyn super PAC and the Washington-based Senate Leadership Fund, have spent more than $7.5 million in advertising since July, mainly criticizing Paxton.

Republicans affiliated with the Senate majority in Washington, including the Senate Leadership Fund, have argued that if Paxton wins the Republican Senate primary, it would cost the party at least $100 million more to win the open seat in Texas. Although the map of states with Senate elections next year favors Republicans, the party can afford to lose no more than four seats and still hold the majority.

O'Rourke has rallied around the state and raised money to support the dozens of Texas House Democrats who left the state earlier this month.

“At a time that so many who have the power to fight are instead bending the knee to Donald Trump,” he said, “the country really needed to see someone stand and fight.”

The redistricting drama has also inspired Allred, a former congressman and voting rights attorney who launched his bid for the Democratic nomination last month, to travel for a series of town halls on redistricting.

Allred told The Associated Press the fight is energizing organizers and voters. He said a pastor in a Black church in Dallas compared the situation to a bully only being able to take it so far before victims start fighting back. 

“If this had passed as quickly as it looked like it was going to, I think many folks wouldn't have known what was happening,” Allred said after a Houston town hall. “There certainly wouldn't have been the national attention on what's happening here in Texas, but that attention has built and built, and the awareness has also built and built, and so this means to me that ultimately there also will be a backlash against these folks who are trying to rig the elections.”

The clash in Texas has elevated the profile of Talarico, a 36-year-old legislator from Austin. He was among those who packed their bags and headed to Chicago. Talarico has appeared on network television and last month was interviewed by conservative podcaster Joe Rogan. 

Talarico's social media following has expanded to more than 1 million on Instagram and TikTok. He has said he is considering a Senate run but hasn't decided yet. O'Rourke had high praise for Talarico but said the young lawmaker's plans wouldn't affect his decision.

“I think this is one of those moments where Democratic voters are looking at who's fighting and who's folding. And that to me is the primary dividing line in our party right now,” Talarico told the AP. “It's not really progressive versus moderates. It's fighters versus folders.”

In his sermon Sunday at Obama's old church in Chicago, Talarico referred to himself as one of the “Texas outlaws” who walked out, prompting loud cheers and applause.

“This is not just a political struggle,” he told them. “It's a spiritual struggle.”

A judge ruled late Friday the Trump administration cannot deny funding to Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles and 30 other cities and counties because of policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration efforts. 

U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco extended a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from cutting off or conditioning the use of federal funds for so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions. His earlier order protected more than a dozen other cities and counties, including San Francisco, Portland and Seattle. 

An email to the White House late Friday was not immediately returned. In his ruling, Orrick said the administration had offered no opposition to an extended injunction except to say the first injunction was wrong. It has appealed the first order.

Orrick also blocked the administration from imposing immigration-related conditions on two particular grant programs.

The Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure on sanctuary communities as it seeks to make good on President Donald Trump's campaign promise to remove millions of people in the country illegally.

One executive order issued by Trump directs Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to withhold federal money from sanctuary jurisdictions. Another order directs every federal agency to ensure that payments to state and local governments do not “abet so-called ‘sanctuary' policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”




The cities and counties that sued said billions of dollars were at risk. 

Orrick, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said the executive orders and the “executive actions that have parroted them” were an unconstitutional “coercive threat.” 

In May, the Department of Homeland Security published a list of more than 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions,” saying each one would receive formal notification that the government had deemed them noncompliant. It also said it would inform them if they were believed to be in violation of any federal criminal statutes.

The list was later removed from the department's website after critics noted it included localities that have actively supported the administration's tough immigration policies.

The Justice Department has also sued New York, Los Angeles and other cities over their sanctuary policies. 

There is no strict definition for sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe places that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide but seeks help from state and local authorities to identify immigrants wanted for deportation and hold them for federal officers.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend repeatedly denied to the Justice Department witnessing any sexually inappropriate interactions with Donald Trump, according to records released Friday meant to distance the Republican president from the disgraced financer.

The Trump administration issued transcripts from interviews that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche conducted with Ghislaine Maxwell last month as the administration was scrambling to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex-trafficking case.

The records show Maxwell repeatedly showering Trump with praise and denying under questioning from Blanche that she had observed Trump engaged in any form of sexual behavior. The administration was presumably eager to make such denials public at a time when the president has faced questions about a long-ago friendship with Epstein and as his administration has endured continued scrutiny over its handling of evidence from the case.

The transcript release represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from Trump's base as they send Congress evidence they had previously kept from view. 

After her interview with Blanche, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas to continue serving a 20-year sentence for her 2021 conviction on allegations that she lured teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Her trial featured sordid accounts of the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 14 told by four women who described being abused as teens in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein's homes. 

Neither Maxwell's lawyers nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move, but one of her lawyers, David Oscar Markus, said in a social media post Friday that Maxwell was “innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted.”

“I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript. “I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”

Maxwell recalled knowing about Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News. She said she had been to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, sometimes alone, but hadn't seen Trump since the mid-2000s. 

Asked if she ever heard Epstein or anyone else say Trump “had done anything inappropriate with masseuses” or anyone else in their orbit, Maxwell replied, “Absolutely never, in any context.”

Maxwell was interviewed over the course of two days last month by Blanche at a Florida courthouse. She was given limited immunity, allowing her to speak freely without fear of prosecution for anything she said except for in the event of a false statement.

Meanwhile, the Justice Department on Friday began sending to the House Oversight Committee records from the investigation that the panel says it intends to make public after removing victim's information.

The case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer's social connections over the years to prominent figures, including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump, who has said he had a falling-out with Epstein years ago and well before Epstein came under investigation.

Maxwell told Blanche that Clinton was initially her friend, not Epstein's, and that she never saw him receive a massage — nor did she believe he ever did. The only times they were together, she said, were the two dozen or so times they traveled on Epstein's plane.

“That would've been the only time that I think that President Clinton could have even received a massage,” Maxwell said. “And he didn't, because I was there.”

She also spoke glowingly of Britain's Prince Andrew and dismissed as “rubbish” the late Virginia Giuffre's claim that she was paid to have a relationship with Andrew and that he had sex with her at Maxwell's London home.

Maxwell sought to distance herself from Epstein's conduct, repeatedly denying allegations made during her trial about her role. Though she acknowledged that at one point Epstein began preferring younger women, she insisted she never understood that to “encompass children.”

“I did see from when I met him, he was involved or -- involved or friends with or whatever, however you want to characterize it, with women who were in their 20s,” she told Blanche. “And then the slide to, you know, 18 or younger looking women. But I never considered that this would encompass criminal behavior.”

Epstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, and was found dead a month later in a New York jail cell in what investigators described as a suicide.

The saga has consumed the Trump administration following a two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department last month that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a “client list” that Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist, and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.

The announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government coverup. That expectation was driven in part by comments from officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who on podcasts before taking their current positions had repeatedly promoted the idea that damaging details about prominent people were being withheld.

Patel, for instance, said in at least one podcast interview before becoming director that Epstein's “black book” was under the “direct control of the director of the FBI.”

The administration had an early stumble in February when far-right influencers were invited to the White House in February and provided by Bondi with binders marked “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “Declassified” that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain.

After the first release fell flat, Bondi said officials were poring over a “truckload” of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI and raised expectations of forthcoming releases.

But after a weekslong review of evidence in the government's possession, the Justice Department determined that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.” The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims and “only a fraction” of it “would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.”

Faced with fury from his base, Trump sought to quickly turn the page, shutting down questioning of Bondi about Epstein at a White House Cabinet meeting and deriding as “weaklings” supporters who he said were falling for the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.”

The Justice Department has responded to a subpoena from House lawmakers by pledging to turn over information.

After the Trump administration announced Thursday that it is reviewing the valid visas of more than 55 million people, social media users began using this figure to inflate the number of noncitizens living in the U.S. by tens of millions.

Posts claimed that these 55 million visa holders, plus about 25 million or more people living in the country illegally, means that nearly a quarter to a third of the people living in the U.S. are not American citizens. The total U.S. population is about 342 million.

But government data contradicts these figures, and experts say the estimates spreading online are highly inflated.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, who was chief of the Navy Reserve, as well as Rear Adm. Milton Sands, a Navy SEAL officer who oversaw Naval Special Warfare Command.

That's according to a U.S. official who spoke Friday on condition of anonymity to detail personnel changes.Hegseth also has fired a general whose agency's initial intelligence assessment of U.S. damage to Iranian nuclear sites angered President Trump.

The reasons for their firings, the latest in a series of steps targeting military leaders, were not clear Friday.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials confirmed ending union recognition for many employees.

It is the latest move by the Trump administration to end collective bargaining with federal employee unions. Previously affected agencies include the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency. 

The American Federation of Government Employees argues that strong union contracts support a stable workforce, especially in public health emergencies.

In a memo sent to Congress, the Justice Department said it agrees with a lawsuit attempting to strike down grants that are reserved for colleges and universities where at least a quarter of undergraduates are Hispanic. 

Congress created the program in 1998 after finding Latino students were going to college and graduating at far lower rates than white students.

Justice Department officials argued the program provides an unconstitutional advantage based on race or ethnicity.

Trump says he's naming White House personnel director Sergio Gor as ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs.

Gor had been tasked with vetting Trump's choices for administration positions, including the president's nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to lead NASA — a bid that was withdrawn in June.

Gor and Donald Trump Jr. also ran a publishing company, Winning Team Publishing, which published two of the president's books.

With schools set to kick off a new year of classes Monday, D.C. Public Schools issued a message Friday seeking to reassure parents concerned that federal law enforcement or Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers would target schools with large immigrant populations.

The DCPS statement declared that all student records were protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and could only be shared “with parental consent and a lawful court order.”

The statement added that law enforcement action on any school grounds can only take place “with a valid warrant or a court order.”

Hundreds of people have been arrested on the streets of Washington, D.C., since President Donald Trump ordered a crackdown on crime in the nation's capital. Some of those people are winding up in the same federal courthouse that was flooded with cases against Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol over four years ago.

At least eight cases filed in the district court for the District of Columbia appear to be related to the recent surge in patrols by federal agents and National Guard members, according to an Associated Press review of court records. Many others facing less serious charges are having their cases heard daily in D.C. Superior Court.

Some attorneys who practice at the neighboring courthouses are bracing for a bigger workload as the cases pile up. So far, however, the legal landscape is nothing like the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

“I don't think we've really felt the brunt of it yet, but I expect it to hit,” defense attorney Damon Catacalos said Friday as he waited for a client's case to be called by a Superior Court judge.

The White House says over 700 people have been arrested since the operation started on Aug. 7. They're facing a wide range of charges, including assaulting law-enforcement officers and illegal possession of drugs and firearms.

President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform celebrated a new Congressional Budget Office update on the impact that tariffs would have on reducing the deficit.

The CBO on Friday issued a new blog post that states tariffs will lower deficits by a combined $4 trillion over the next decade. The latest update is an increase from its last projection in June, that predicted deficits would be reduced by $2.8 trillion over 10 years.

Trump said the CBO, which he called “Radical Left Representatives” had “admitted how incredible my Tariff strategy has been.”

Staffed by some 275 economists, analysts and other employees, the CBO provides Congress with objective, impartial information about budgetary and economic issues.

Its current director is Phillip Swagel, a former Treasury official in Republican President George W. Bush's administration.

President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform said Friday that his administration would complete a “major tariff investigation” into furniture imported into the U.S. and will issue a report on its findings within the next 50 days.

He said furniture coming from other countries into the U.S. would be tariffed at a rate not yet determined. The intent is to bring the furniture business back to North Carolina, South Carolina and Michigan, among other states, he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin praised U.S. President Donald Trump Friday, describing the U.S. leader as “the light at the end of the tunnel” for struggling Moscow-Washington relations.

“Our relationship with the United States is at one of the lowest levels it's been since the end of World War II,” Putin said at an event in Sarov, a closed city about 370 kilometers (230 miles) east of Moscow that has served as a base for Russia's nuclear weapons program since the late 1940s. “But with the arrival of President Trump, I think that a light at the end of the tunnel has finally appeared.”

Putin also commended Trump's leadership qualities and said he hoped that the first steps had been taken to ensure the “full-scale restoration” of Russia-U.S. ties. He said that Russian companies were already discussing plans with “American partners” on opportunities for co-operation across the Arctic and in Alaska in areas such as liquified natural gas.

The comments come the same day as Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, appeared in a taped interview for NBC's Sunday show “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” saying that there were no plans for a meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy – a proposal that Trump has repeatedly floated to end Russia's three-year invasion of their neighbor.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker had a cool reaction Friday to President Donald Trump's suggestion that Chicago might be his next target for a crime crackdown featuring the National Guard like that occurring in Washington, D.C.

The Democrat posted “Things People are Begging For” on X, including cheaper groceries and reversing cuts to Medicaid and food aid for low-income families but not “an authoritarian power grab of major cities.

”Trump has disparaged the Second City for years, repeatedly comparing it to Afghanistan and threatening to “send in the feds” to stem gun violence.

Violent crime in Chicago dropped significantly in the first half of the year, representing the steepest drop in over a decade, according to city data. Shootings and homicides were down more than 30% in the first half of 2025 compared to the same time last year, and total violent crime dropped by over 22%.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired a general whose agency's initial intelligence assessment of damage to Iranian nuclear sites from U.S. strikes angered President Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the decision and a White House official.

Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse will no longer serve as head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

The firing comes a few months after details of the preliminary assessment leaked to the media. It found that Iran's nuclear program has been set back only a few months by the U.S. strikes, contradicting assertions from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Trump says Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.

Speaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan — which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.

“I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,” Trump said. “He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.”

The official announcement is expected to come later Friday, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.

After her interview, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida where she had been serving a 20-year sentence to a minimum security prison camp in Texas. 

Neither her lawyer nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move.

The Epstein case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer's social connections over the years to prominent figures including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump, who has said his relationship with Epstein ended years before.

The first batch of Epstein-related files from the department includes 33,000 pages of documents, according to committee staff. 

“The Committee intends to make these records public after thorough review to ensure any victims' identification and child sexual abuse material are redacted,” a spokesperson for Oversight Committee Chair James Comer said. “The Committee will also consult with the DOJ to ensure any documents released do not negatively impact ongoing criminal cases and investigations.”

The committee subpoenaed files related to the late sexual predator following a public outcry over the administration's handling of its promises to release more information related to Epstein conduct and demise. House Democrats seized on the issue and ultimately helped push Comer to subpoena the DOJ for documents along with every living U.S. attorney general as well as Bill and Hillary Clinton. 

“The Trump DOJ is providing records at a far quicker pace than anything the Biden DOJ ever provided,” the committee spokesperson continued.

Maxwell recalled knowing about Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News.

“I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript.

Maxwell said her father was fond of Trump's then-wife, Ivana, “because she was also from Czechoslovakia, where my dad was from.”

Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from jail in Tennessee on Friday so he can rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges.



The Salvadoran national's case became a flashpoint in President Donald Trump's immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on criminal charges.



Although Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. Those fears were somewhat allayed by a recent ruling in a separate case, which requires immigration officials to allow Abrego Garcia time to mount a challenge to any deportation order.

The Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of interviews its No. 2 official did with Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend as the Trump administration scrambles to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex-trafficking case.

The disclosure represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from President Donald Trump's base even as they continue to sit on other evidence they had suggested was being prepared for public release.

Trump is filing an appeal after a judge said his executive order targeting a prominent law firm violated the firm's First Amendment rights.

The executive order forbid the federal government from doing business with anyone who hires the law firm Susman Godfrey, citing the firm's election-related work performed after Trump's 2020 loss. Susman Godfrey was one of several law firms targeted by Trump's executive orders, and the firm sued in April.

In late June, District Court Judge Loren AliKhan granted summary judgment in Susman Godfrey's favor, noting that noting that by that point every court to have considered a challenge to the law-firm-related orders had found “grave constitutional violations.”

Department of Justice attorney Richard Lawson filed the notice of appeal in the D.C. Circuit Court on Friday. The President is also appealing rulings in other cases brought by law firms.

Acknowledging the change announced earlier Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth tweeted a news story about his order for troops to carry guns and said, “Common Sense.”

The Pentagon has released few details about the shift or why it was necessary that about 2,000 troops in the nation's capital for President Donald Trump's law enforcement crackdown needed to be armed.

“We're going to see whether or not they have a meeting,” Trump told reporters. “It'll be interesting to see. If they don't, why didn't they have a meeting, because I told them to have a meeting. But I'll know what I am going to do in two weeks.”

Trump said he had begun making arrangements for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting on Monday soon after concluding White House talks with Zelenskyy and European leaders and speaking by phone with Putin.

Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, made clear on Friday that Putin won't sit-down with Zelenskyy until Ukraine agrees to certain concessions.

The president said he called earlier this month for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign after reading something written by Arkansas Republican senator.

Trump didn't clarify what he was referring to but said that after he met with Tan, he liked him and felt he was “somewhat a victim.”

He backed off his calls for his resignation after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter and met with Trump.

Muriel Bowser generally avoids directly criticizing President Donald Trump. Even when she is being harshly critical of Trump's decisions — publicly stating that his declaration of a federal crime emergency in Washington “makes no sense” — Bowser sometimes seems to structure her statements so as to avoid actually saying Trump's name.

Trump, meanwhile, seems to be escalating his attacks on Bowser. 

In a 2 a.m. Friday social media post, Trump wrote, “Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen, including a complete and total Federal takeover of the City!”

Hours later in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters, “Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor for long.”

Some members of local government have bristled at the Defense Department's order to arm National Members. 

“Trump is once again putting armed military onto the streets of an American city. These are the actions not of a president, but of someone on the march to an authoritarian takeover,” District of Columbia Council Member Charles Allen said in a statement. 

As a federal district, the local government's powers are broadly delegated to it Congress, leaving local officials few avenues to formally block or protest Trump's plan.

Members of local government have been walking a tightrope of engaging with constituents' concerns without further antagonizing the administration.

City Council Chair Phil Mendelson wrote on social media that he'd discussed “the affects of the so-called crime emergency,” among other topics, with Washington residents at a town hall last night. Council Member Brianne Nadeau posted a link to report police misconduct to city officials shortly after the Pentagon's announcement.

During his event about FIFA, Trump unexpectedly pulled out a photo of him standing next to Putin during their meeting in Alaska.

Trump said Putin sent the picture and “I'm going to sign this for him.” He added that Putin has “very respectful of me and my country, and not so respectful of others.”

Putin invaded Ukraine more than three years ago, and Trump has been frustrated by his inability to resolve the war. 

Speaking of FIFA, Trump suggested that the Russian leader wants to attend the soccer competition in the U.S.

“He may be coming and he may not, depending on what happens,” he said.

Referring to the photo, Trump said, “I thought it was a nice picture of him. OK, of me, but nice of him.”

After Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a pause in providing U.S. visas to commercial truck drivers, the Trump administration says it applies to certain foreign applicants.

The State Department said Friday that the pause affects those seeking permission to drive a truck under visas for H-2B temporary nonagricultural workers, E-2 investors in U.S. businesses or EB-3 skilled workers.

It said the government is launching a review of the way it screens foreign drivers and that “enhanced vetting” will apply to those who don't now hold valid visas.

“Applicants must demonstrate the necessary skills, experience, and English language proficiency required to safely operate these vehicles on America's roads,” the department said.

Touching the World Cup trophy is an honor usually reserved for countries that win it. But organizers of the 2026 World Cup have made an exception for Trump.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino visited the Oval Office on Friday and noted of the trophy, “Only the FIFA presidents, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it because it's for winners only.”Then, he added to Trump, “And, since you are a winner, of course you can as well.”

The president did just that, then responded, “It's pretty heavy.”

He later called the trophy “a beautiful piece of gold” and joked about keeping it and displaying in the Oval Office — which Trump has redone in a gaudy, gold-hued décor.

Trump was subsequently presented with a ticket to next year's World Cup final, which organizers said was the first ticket available for the upcoming tournament.

Trump usually wears a tie in the Oval Office, as do top aides and other officials who visit.

But in an unusual move, not only did Trump not wear a tie but none of the men standing around him did either.

Bare collars were also sported by Vice President JD Vance, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Kennedy Center interim head Richard Grenell and Andrew Giuliani, who is heading up the president's FIFA task force.

It wasn't clear why they wore the unified look.

The president suggested that other cities will receive similar treatment to D.C.

“I think Chicago will be our next,” he said. “And then we'll help with New York.”

Trump said people in Chicago are “screaming for us to come.”

Vice President JD Vance says it's not the case that the Trump administration is targeting former national security adviser John Bolton because he's a vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

The FBI on Friday searched the home and office of Bolton, who served in the first Trump administration, as part of a criminal investigation into the potential mishandling of classified information.

Vance said in an interview with NBC News's “Meet the Press” that the investigation was in its early stages. He said the inquiry centers in part on classified documents as well as what he said was a “broad concern” about Bolton. He said if no crime is found during the investigation, no prosecution will be brought, but that if a crime is found “Ambassador Bolton will get his day in court.”

He said “no, not at all” when asked if Bolton was being pursued because of his criticism of Trump and, that if that were the case, “we would just throw out prosecutions willy-nilly.”

Speaking from the Oval Office alongside FIFA head Gianni Infantino, the president said the FIFA draw would take place at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 5.

Trump has made the Kennedy Center a focal point for his efforts to remake Washington, visiting it earlier in the day and talking extensively about renovations to the building. He referred to it as the “Trump-Kennedy Center.”

ESPN had previously reported that the draw would be held in Las Vegas.

The Education Department's Office of Civil Rights issued the finding against the public university in Virginia.

The department says the university must review its policies, conduct annual trainings and issue a statement that includes a personal apology from the president. It directs the university to comply within 10 days.University officials did not respond immediately to an email request for comment on Friday.

The federal investigation follows a complaint by multiple professors accusing the university of favoring faculty candidates based on diversity considerations rather than their credentials.

President Trump's announcement Friday that he would seek $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington D.C. will likely be received with ironic eyerolls from the local government. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the D.C. Council have spent most of 2025 (prior to the current federal takeover crisis) dealing with an artificial budget crisis created by this Congress.

An obscure change in a federal government funding bill forced the district's government to revert to its 2024 budget parameters, effectively cutting $1.1 billion from its previously balanced budget midway through the financial year.

The Senate approved the funding bill with the cut but immediately followed up with a separate bill that would make the district's budget whole again. That bill has languished in the House of Representatives for months while Bowser was forced to make drastic moves to avoid layoffs. The hard feelings over the issue remain intense.

Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, a government official familiar with the matter said Friday.

The official said Canada will include the carve-out that the U.S. has on Canadian goods under the 2020 free trade deal that shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly ahead of the expected announcement by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

“We're doing some very detailed renovations, fixing things are broken. Fixing floors that are cracked up and not good anymore, and in many cases, they were done in the 50s and 60s and 70s,” Trump told reporters Friday. “We'll be doing the Lincoln Bathroom which was Art Deco.”

He said of the project, “We're making it actually incredible.”

According to the White House, the refurbishing of the Lincoln Bedroom and the adjoining sitting room — which featured strong period decor derived and adapted from the historical evidence of the Lincoln era — was completed in November 2005.

Trump suggested the Lincoln Bathroom work could “be done in about a week, two weeks” and said he was considering “doing something on the Executive Office Building” across the street from the White House saying it'd be “all cosmetic.”

Trump has already made extensive changes to the White House, including installing patio seating around the Rose Garden and promising to build a ballroom.

“We're going to be raising about $2 billion from Congress,” the president told reporters. “Congress is happy to do it.”

Trump has talked about refinishing the roads and sprucing up light poles around the capital.

“It hasn't been clean,” he said. “Now it's going to be clean.”

The president, for a while, has been covering bruising on the back of his hand with makeup that doesn't match his skin tone.

A large spread of makeup could be seen on the back of his hand on Friday that appeared more pronounced than usual.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Trump's hand bruising is “consistent” with irritation from his “frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin.”

Republican National Committee members elected Gruters on Friday at their summer meeting in Georgia. He had no opposition.

“Mr. President, thank you for your faith in me,” Gruters said after the vote.

Gruters is a Florida state lawmaker and former state party chairman who was a Trump ally even before the billionaire real estate and marketing mogul first ran for president.

Trump has tightened his grip on the RNC since his first presidential term. Gruters succeeds Michael Whatley, who stepped down to run for U.S. Senate in North Carolina.

The Texas Senate has gaveled in for a expected vote on new congressional voting maps for the 2026 midterm elections.

Republicans hope new maps pushed by President Trump will produce five new GOP seats in a bid to hold their slim majority in the U.S. House. Senate approval would send the maps to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to sign into law. Texas' gerrymandering effort has triggered a ripple effect across several states. California on Thursday passed a bill to put new Democratic-leaning districts to voters in November.

Norm Eisen, a former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic and legal adviser to Democrats during the president's first impeachment, says the search of Bolton's home and office is “an obvious act of intimidation.”

“Raiding the home of a high-profile critic in this way is an attack on the fundamental American right to disagree with the government,” Eisen said in a joint statement with Susan Corke, executive director of the group Democracy Defenders Fund.

He contrasted the operation with the 2022 search on Trump's Florida estate when the president was investigated for keeping classified documents, saying the FBI unsuccessfully negotiated with Trump for a year before executing it.

The president said his crackdown was keeping people safe, claiming it's “the first time in anybody's memory that you haven't had a murder in a week” in the nation's capital.

That's not true, however. There were no killings for one week in July and for another week in May, according to local police statistics.

And it comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, with the arrival this week of hundreds of troops from several Republican-led states.

The Pentagon and Army said last week that troops would not carry weapons.

The city had been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Two teenagers charged in connection with an attempted carjacking and brutal beating of a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer earlier this month have been released from youth custody.

A 15-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, who were charged with unarmed carjacking days after the attack, have been given lighter restrictions.

Since their arrest, the suspects had been held at D.C.'s Youth Services Center (YSC), where juveniles are placed in secure detention by court order. According to reports, Judge Kendra D. Briggs, who was nominated by then-President Joe Biden in 2021, ruled that one of the teens would be sent to a youth shelter while the other would be granted home arrest.

‘RADICAL' DC OFFICIALS TREATED OFFICERS ‘LIKE CRAP,' POLICE LEADER SAYS – 7 ATTACKS THAT LED TO TRUMP TAKEOVER

While the teens are being released from the YSC, they are still subject to curfews, weekly drug tests and electronic monitoring, NBC4 Washington reported.

On Aug. 3, Edward Coristine, better known by his nickname, ""Big Balls,"" was assaulted at approximately 3:00 a.m. by a group of teenagers in the city's Logan Circle neighborhood. The teens allegedly attempted to carjack him and a woman, whom police identified as his significant other, according to authorities.

Police said Coristine pushed the woman into the vehicle for safety and turned to confront the group. At least several of the teens then attacked him, police said, until officers patrolling nearby intervened. As officers moved toward the group, the teens fled on foot.

BLUE CITIES IN TRUMP'S CROSSHAIRS AFTER DC POLICE TAKEOVER

A photo of a bloodied Coristine went viral, sparking outrage over the city's handling of crime and drawing President Donald Trump's attention. The president slammed D.C., saying crime in the city was ""totally out of control.""

""Local ‘youths' and gang members, some only 14, 15, and 16-years-old, are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent citizens, at the same time knowing that they will be almost immediately released. They are not afraid of Law Enforcement because they know nothing ever happens to them, but it's going to happen now!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Briggs' ruling comes amid a heated debate on the handling of crime in D.C. and Trump's crime crackdown.

On Aug. 11, the president directed federal law enforcement to increase its presence in the city. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the move, saying that ""there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C.""

Trump met with law enforcement and National Guard personnel on Thursday and praised them for their work and the ""incredible results"" of the crackdown. His approach appears to be working, as Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital that there has not been a homicide in the city in more than a week, coinciding with the takeover.

While many connected Trump's decision to federalize D.C. to Coristine's assault, it was a topic he touched on during his presidential campaign. He spoke about the need to better secure D.C. after the tragic January 2024 murder of Mike Gill, a Republican who worked under the Obama and Trump administrations. Gill was waiting to pick up his wife from work when an armed carjacker opened fire in broad daylight. Gill died three days later.

As the Republican National Committee elects Joe Gruters as chair, succeeding Michael Whatley, the incoming and outgoing chairs stand for an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, at the RNC's summer meeting in Atlanta.

In a political party where politicians who call Florida home have risen to the heights of power, it's no surprise that the new chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) hails from the Sunshine State.

Joe Gruters, a longtime ally of Florida resident President Donald Trump, was unanimously elected Friday as RNC chair at the national party committee's summer meeting.

Gruters is a Florida state senator, RNC committee member from the Sunshine State, and, briefly, the national party committee's treasurer before stepping down after being elected chair.

He's also close with another Floridian, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, who was co-campaign manager of Trump's 2024 presidential bid.

Gruters succeeded now-former chair Michael Whatley, who stepped down as he runs for the Senate in North Carolina in the blockbuster race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Thom Tillis.

""Congratulations to MAGA Warrior Joe Gruters, who I very strongly Endorsed, on his unanimous Election as Chairman of the Republican National Committee,"" Trump wrote in a social media post following Gruters' ascension to RNC chair.

Trump touted that Gruters ""helped us deliver Massive and Historic Victories"" in the Sunshine State and ""helped us turn Florida, RED AS RED CAN BE!""

The election of Gruters, a 48-year-old accountant, as RNC chair is the latest sign of Trump's complete control over the national party committee.

""This is the president's party. This is the president's vision, overall. The party fully embraces the president,"" Gruters said as he and Whatley stood for an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.

And Gruters is looking to the president as Republicans defend their House and Senate majoritues in next year's midterm elections.

""We're gonna ride the president all the way to victory in the midterms, and we are going to win big,"" Gruters said.

The Trump administration is cracking down on crime in D.C. and mobilizing National Guard soldiers and airmen.

President Donald Trump's grip on Washington D.C.'s police force continued into a second week, spurring Democrats to reignite demands for the district to become a state.

Trump last week invoked a provision of the Home Rule Act, the law that gives the nation's capital some autonomy from Congress, to effectively take over the Metropolitan Police Department in an effort to crack down on crime.

Since then, numerous federal law enforcement agencies and the National Guard, aided by reserves from states across the country, have patrolled the streets of D.C., and the White House has touted rapid decreases in crime and dozens of arrests.

Because it's not a state, Washington has no voting representation in Congress and, despite having a mayor and city council, is overseen by Congress.

But some lawmakers see the move as another attempt by the president to overextend his powers, and argue that it's another reason that D.C. should be a state — a notion that Trump last week rebuked as ""ridiculous.""

""If D.C. was a state, the president could not do what he is doing outside of the federal enclave,"" Sen. Paul Strauss, the district's shadow senator, told Fox News Digital.

Strauss, D-D.C., has long pushed for statehood in his role as shadow senator, Washington D.C.'s elected non-voting member of the Senate. He said the whole idea behind statehood is to give D.C. residents agency and self-determination, something he believed the crackdown was ignoring.

""It would be one thing if we actually had a crime emergency here, but we don't,"" Strauss said. ""Violent crime in particular is down to 30-year lows. That's not what's happening here. He is using these national guardsmen and women as a stunt, and that's wrong.""

TRUMP AUTHORIZED TO CONTROL DC POLICE INDEFINITELY UNDER HOUSE GOP PROPOSAL

His colleague in the House, D.C. non-voting Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, also a Democrat, agreed.

""The president's abuses are evidence of the urgent need for D.C. statehood so that more than 700,000 D.C. residents can finally have the full rights and privileges afforded to other Americans, including control of their own local resources and policies,"" she said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers countered that violent crime in the district has ""been spiraling out of control – and the Democrats are lying to the American people when they pretend there is no crime in our nation's capital."" 

""If they needed some anecdotal evidence, they could ask their own Democrat colleague about the time he was carjacked outside of his D.C. apartment by three armed criminals,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""The Democrats' case of Trump Derangement Syndrome is so severe, they won't even support President Trump's commonsense policies to remove dangerous criminals from the streets of our nation's capital.""

Strauss and Norton were joined by lawmakers from neighboring Virginia and Maryland, the states that Washington, D.C., was carved out of over two centuries ago, who argued that Trump's move to federalize the local police shined ""a light on the urgent need for D.C. statehood.""

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told Fox News Digital that the police takeover was ""a prime example of why D.C. deserves the same rights as states.""

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., charged that ""Republicans in Congress have been all too willing to play political games with the district's funding for public safety and critical services while backing an authoritarian overreach by a lawless president.""

Van Hollen announced plans earlier this month to reintroduce a bill alongside Norton to grant statehood to D.C.

Van Hollen, Norton and Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., introduced a joint resolution in the House to halt Trump's takeover of the D.C. police, too.

Raskin told Fox News Digital in a statement that the district's residents are ""the only people who live in a capital city on earth who are disenfranchised in their national legislature.""

""The people of Washington have petitioned for statehood and should be admitted as a state rather than treated as a MAGA-colonized populace,"" he said.

But the reality of actually turning D.C. into a state, at least while Republicans have a trifecta in Washington, is slim at best.

""I think there's probably not a pathway to get this done while Republicans control all three branches of the government,"" Strauss said. ""Because they have shown that they're more interested in the partisan impact of controlling the legislative branch and not really interested in the principle of self-determination for Washington, D.C., residents.""

Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo discusses Democrats streaming their latest political stunts and Sen. Chuck Schumer appointing Jackie Kennedy's grandson, who mocked Melania Trump on Instagram, to the America250 Commission on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee was sworn into his new leadership role earlier this week by former Vice President Kamala Harris – one of the key ex-White House officials the panel's chair is interested in hearing from in its probe of President Joe Biden.

Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., was elected to serve as ranking member of the committee in June, following the death of former ranking member Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va.

Harris, who swore Garcia in as mayor of Long Beach in 2014 when she was California's attorney general, reprised that role on Wednesday in a ceremonial swearing-in when Garcia took over his new Oversight role.

It happened the same week as House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., again didn't rule out bringing Harris in before his committee, as he investigates whether former President Joe Biden's top aides conspired to hide signs of mental decline in the ex-commander-in-chief.

""I think that it would be helpful to hear from Kamala Harris,"" Comer told Fox News Digital on Thursday. 

""And I think that, you know, if I were her, wanted to have a political future, I would want to set the record straight on a lot of this stuff. Because it's going to haunt her her entire political career, because nobody thinks that Joe Biden was calling the shots in the end.""

The House Oversight Committee's ranking member has traditionally served as a top foil to the party in power, coordinating their party's response to investigations led by the panel's majority.

Among House Oversight Republicans' key focuses right now is the probe into Biden.

A Republican member of the panel, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., previously called for Harris to be subpoenaed, but Comer said it was still up in the air.

""We haven't decided whether we're going to issue the subpoena or not, but certainly she's welcome to come to the committee,"" Comer said.

Garcia said Wednesday that he was ""honored"" to be sworn in by Harris, who he said ""has always fought for our country and shown us what true leadership looks like.""

""I'm especially grateful to have been able to share this moment with Vice President Harris, and I'm ready to get to work to hold Donald Trump and his administration accountable for their corruption and abuses of power. We will deliver real results for the American people,"" Garcia said in a statement without mentioning Comer's Biden probe.

He was elected to the ranking member role via an internal House Democratic Caucus vote, besting three other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas. Crockett notably dropped out of the race after failing to win Democratic leaders' recommendation for the job.

Former assistant U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss another Chinese national being arrested for allegedly smuggling bio weapons in the country and California Governor Gavin Newsom suing President Donald Trump. 

A Chinese national living in Texas was sentenced on Thursday to four years in prison and three years of supervised release for installing malicious code on his former employer's systems, including a ""kill switch"" that locked workers out when his account was disabled.

Davis Lu — a 55-year-old man residing legally in Houston — was convicted in March of intentionally damaging protected computers while working as a software developer for the Ohio-based company, according to a news release from the U.S. Department of Justice.

""The defendant breached his employer's trust by using his access and technical knowledge to sabotage company networks, wreaking havoc and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses for a U.S. company,"" Matthew R. Galeotti, acting assistant attorney general of the criminal division at the DOJ, said in a statement.

Lu — who worked at the company for nearly twelve years — began undermining his employer's systems after a 2018 corporate realignment reduced his system access and work responsibilities. By August 2019, he had planted malicious code that triggered system crashes and blocked employees from logging in, as noted in the release.

He deleted coworkers' profile files, created ""infinite loops"" that overwhelmed servers and built a ""kill switch"" designed to lock out all users if his account was ever disabled. He named the ""kill switch"" code ""IsDLEnabledinAD,"" an abbreviation for, ""Is Davis Lu enabled in Active Directory,"" according to the DOJ.

That ""kill switch"" was triggered in September 2019 when Lu was placed on leave and told to return his company laptop, instantly shutting out thousands of users worldwide, according to the release.

On the day he was ordered to give back his laptop, Lu also wiped encrypted data from company systems. His search history revealed that he researched how to hide processes, escalate privileges and quickly erase files — suggesting an attempt to slow down recovery efforts, according to the DOJ.

""I am proud of the FBI cyber team's work which led to today's sentencing and hope it sends a strong message to others who may consider engaging in similar unlawful activities,"" Brett Leatherman, assistant director of the cyber division at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), said in a statement. ""This case also underscores the importance of identifying insider threats early and highlights the need for proactive engagement with your local FBI field office to mitigate risks and prevent further harm.""

A former DEI employee at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire won her discrimination lawsuit against the school, earning her $265,000.

Rochelle Hoffman, who is white, sued the school after she became the interim director of the campus's Multicultural Student Services office. That lawsuit, filed in 2023, detailed multiple instances of students saying Hoffman was not fit for a position serving students of color.

According to the complaint, one student allegedly asked Olga Diaz, the school's former vice chancellor for equity, diversity, inclusion, and student affairs, “You hired a White woman as the interim director?”

Another student allegedly asked Diaz if “white staff” can do as well “within a space for people of color.”

Hoffman later felt compelled to resign as a result of the pressure and other staff questioning her “legitimacy,” the complaint says.

In a statement to Fox News after the settlement, Hoffman said, although she faced “unlawful discrimination” while serving in her DEI role, she is still “steadfast in my belief that high-quality, accessible education … is essential for all learners.”

“I believe deeply in leading and teaching with integrity and in choosing the harder right over the easier wrong. My commitment to student-centered learning and academic excellence remains as strong as ever,” Hoffman added.

Hoffman's lawyer also said they did not bring the lawsuit as a measure of opposition to DEI or the school's programs, but because the college “unlawfully discriminated against an employee who championed those programs with substantial success.”

“Such actions can undermine the credibility of the programs the University seeks to promote,” her lawyer added.

The settlement comes as the Trump administration has targeted diversity, equity, and inclusion offices and policies at universities across the United States.

Specifically, the administration has brought Title VII violations against schools that it believes are using DEI practices in faculty hiring and general student guidance, among other things.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FINDS COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY VIOLATED CIVIL RIGHTS LAW

The Department of Justice recently announced a civil rights investigation into the University of California, alleging its faculty hiring practices violated civil rights law. The school used its “UC 2030 Capacity Plan” to allegedly expand the university's tenure-track faculty rapidly while prioritizing demographic diversity.

The buying and selling of human babies has gone unnoticed by federal policymakers for too long, but that may soon change. In the past three months, the subject has generated several stories that reveal an alarming level of political neglect. It was discovered that a man on the sex offender registry purchased a baby in Pennsylvania, two children bought through surrogacy were discovered in a cage in San Francisco, and 21 other children bought through surrogacy were found in just one home in Los Angeles after doctors called police because a baby was taken to the emergency room with intracranial bleeding.

Proponents of Big Surrogacy argue that it is no different and equally beneficial as adoption. This could not be more wrong. Adoption meets some of the needs of children who have already been born, who, for whatever sad reason, are separated from their mothers. Surrogacy is about creating babies to meet the desires of adults. These desires require the separation of mother and child, which in all other circumstances is understood to be something best prevented for the good of the child, the mother, and society in general. Recent surrogacy horror stories are not aberrations in an otherwise benevolent industry; they are the logical conclusion of the commodification of human beings.

Since the Supreme Court created a federal right to same-sex marriages in 2015, the commercial surrogacy industry has boomed from a couple of hundred million dollars to more than $4 billion. Pictures of gay couples holding infants to their chests are now commonly circulated on social media. But behind those pictures is a denial of the intense connection between mother and child. 

Babies develop preferential responses to maternal scents and sounds while still in the womb, and these persist after birth. Studies show that removing babies from their mothers causes stress in mother and baby, creating long-term problems. The desire of adults to have children is understandable, but the government should not facilitate a freewheeling industry that knowingly inflicts harm on mother and child.

The federal government recognizes the problem of separating mother and infant in the puppy breeding industry — which also happens to be worth $4 billion, which is why the Animal Welfare Act makes it illegal for dog breeders to separate them in the first eight weeks of the puppies' lives. But the government has so far chosen to see no evil in the wild west of the human surrogacy industry. There is no such regulation. It is obviously absurd for federal law to concern itself with the protection of dogs but not people.

Defenders of the surrogacy industry frame the issue as a simple contract for service. A couple pays a young woman for her time and labor the same way they pay a maid to clean their house. But surrogacy is so much more than that. It is common for the buyers of babies to stipulate in their contract that the mother must terminate her child if she is caught using drugs or alcohol. Such forced abortions have happened. 

Then there is the question of what happens if a mother changes her mind and wants to keep her baby. A surrogate did this in the Los Angeles case mentioned above. What happens? The mother is taken to court and forced to deliver on the contract. She is forced to hand over her child. California enforces contracts for the purchase of a baby.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS PASS RULE CHALLENGING SUPREME COURT RULING

No state court should enforce contracts for the buying and selling of humans. We ended the ownership of people in this country more than a century and a half ago. At a bare minimum, Congress should ban the removal of babies from their mothers in commercial transactions in the first eight weeks of the baby's life. 

Congress should do more. It should ban the enforcement of contracts that involve the buying of human babies. A child is not property but a person with rights. It is again time that the government should treat them that way.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A federal judge on Friday expanded his ruling blocking the Trump administration from cancelling government funding to dozens of accused sanctuary jurisdictions.  

San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Orrick in April ruled in favor of 16 counties and cities that sued the Trump administration's efforts to rescind billions in funding due to criticism that their policies on illegal immigrants were out of compliance with federal immigration law. His ruling applied only to those jurisdictions, as opposed to other court injunctions that have held nationwide implications.

This week, the California judge ruled again on the matter in response to further lawsuits brought by dozens more jurisdictions that joined the lawsuit. Orrick's preliminary injunction further blocks the Trump administration from ending funding to 34 additional cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Boston, and Baltimore. 

The legal setback comes as President Donald Trump has made targeting illegal immigrants, and the jurisdictions accused of harboring them, one of the cornerstone priorities of his second term. Attorney General Pam Bondi at the Justice Department has sued multiple cities over the issue, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has also spearheaded efforts to target illegal immigrants. 

On Jan. 20, the president issued an executive order that directed Bondi and Noem to ensure “sanctuary jurisdictions “do not receive access to federal funds.” 

Days after Orrick first ruled the directive was “likely unconstitutional,” blocking the administration from enforcing it against 16 cities and counties that sued, Trump signed another executive order on the matter. The April 28 directive ordered his administration, led by Bondi and Noem, to draw up a list of sanctuary cities that are not complying with federal immigration laws. 

TEXAS HOUSE PASSES MOTION FOR ARREST WARRANTS FOR DEMOCRATS WHO FLED STATE

Bondi and Noem released a list of over 500 such “sanctuary jurisdictions” in late May that was later taken offline. The list was originally published on the DHS website, with officials sending notices to each city stating that the government considers it noncompliant with federal immigration law and may be violating federal criminal statutes. 

Months later, Bondi in August issued a significantly smaller list highlighting top sanctuary jurisdictions on the Trump administration's radar, including 13 states, four counties, and 18 cities, and threatening further lawsuits from places that refuse to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Later that month, she reiterated a sharp admonition to governing officials, stating they could soon lose federal funding if they continued to block cooperation with ICE.

GLYNCO, Georgia — In the coming months, 10,000 recruits hired by Immigration and Customs Enforcement will pass through the federal agency's training academy in coastal Georgia before fanning out across the country to carry out President Donald Trump's deportation agenda.

At the facility, the newest officers from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations arm will undergo an eight-week training course covering topics ranging from immigration law to firearms and driving safety before they are sent to a field office to begin working alongside their peers.

The Washington Examiner took part in an all-day tour of the 5,400-acre Federal Law Enforcement Training Center on Thursday, accompanied by acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

The center, known as FLETC, is located between Jacksonville, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia. Every year, FLETC hosts 68,000 students from 105 federal law enforcement agencies to be trained on-site, with about 3,000 on campus at any given time. Students who graduate will come back for additional training throughout their careers.

Lyons compared FLETC to a college campus where students, despite studying various topics, are together in one setting. In this case, incoming and tenured employees from agencies such as the Secret Service, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Marshals Service live in a single community for several weeks or months as they complete certifications and trainings.

Inside the secured perimeter, the campus boasts dormitories and apartment housing; a cafeteria able to accommodate thousands of students and staff; a state-of-the-art gym, large indoor pool, and physical training center; firearms training facilities; four driver training tracks; a main street and neighborhood set for active shooter and emergency response training; expansive educational buildings; and recreation sites, including a baseball field.

When not in class, students can check out paddleboards and kayaks, among other equipment, for recreation. As government employees, recruits may come and go from the campus as they please when not in class or training.

As part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ICE received $29.9 billion for hiring staff, transporting illegal immigrants, and detaining families. On the hiring front, the money was intended for 10,000 new staff who specifically enforce immigration law within the United States.

Before officers arrive on campus, located inside the small city of Brunswick, they will complete two weeks of online courses.

Basic training for all incoming ICE recruits is eight weeks long. It used to include an additional five weeks of Spanish language classes, but that was recently rescinded and replaced with a translation service for officers in the field.

Caleb Vitello, the former acting director of ICE who was moved by the Trump administration earlier this year to oversee ICE deportation officer training at FLETC, said training has been streamlined to address the increase in recruits.

Depending on the number of arrivals, the site can expand its trainings to two to three shifts per day and have instructors available seven days a week, Vitello said.

Upon completion, officers will be matched with a certified trainer for whichever location they are assigned to and continue training in a real-life environment.

Lyons and Vitello did not provide an estimate on how long it would take for all 10,000 new recruits to be hired and trained at FLETC. The agency has received 121,000 applications since mid-July, Lyons said Thursday.

ICE incentivized the public to apply with offers of hiring bonuses as large as $50,000 and $60,000 in student loan repayment, and also took steps such as removing the age limit and opening the program up to candidates who are not college graduates. The result has been 12 times as many applicants as are needed, which Lyons said allows them to “be picky” about who they ultimately hire.

The goal of training is to ensure new employees grasp immigration law and how to carry out duties from the beginning stages of arrest and detention to final removal. ICE is only responsible for enforcing certain federal laws, not state or local ones, such as traffic offenses.

Officers are trained in law enforcement regulations, defensive techniques, and how to process immigrants in their custody, carry out at-large operations on the street, and operate firearms. Vitello said the goal for ICE officers who interact with the public is not to use force as they speak with people about their immigration status.

“You'd rather de-escalate with words before you have to use any use of force,” Lyons said.

To graduate, officers must complete an obstacle course in under 1 minute and 45 seconds, among many other requirements. While it is not a military-style course, Lyons said the point is to prepare trainees for situations where they might have to quickly get out of their government vehicle to chase someone, jump a fence, crawl through a window, or carry their injured partner a distance.

Inside a nearby training center that will soon be doubled by 40,000 square feet, recruits learn hand-to-hand combat and can access state-of-the-art gym equipment across multiple large rooms. 

Vitello said one of FLETC's newest priorities is training for mental and physical wellness today and in 20 years, though officials did not provide details on how mental health is being prioritized.

Officials showed where recruits will go through a driving course and learn how to maneuver in poor weather conditions and high-speed chases.

President Donald Trump is set to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell next year. Here is what some of his potential picks said recently about interest rates and monetary policy.

Powell has rankled Trump and his allies for months for overseeing a Fed that has thus far refused to cut interest rates due to fears of another uptick in inflation. Powell indicated on Friday at his annual address in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that a rate cut is coming, but Trump wants much more aggressive action.

It should be noted that the Fed chair's influence over monetary policy is not absolute. Decisions about interest rates are instead up to a 12-person board called the Federal Open Market Committee. It decides collectively what the course of monetary policy should be.

But whoever Trump picks will be the head of the committee and will have sway over monetary policy in that capacity.

Current Fed Gov. Christopher Waller, who was nominated to the post by Trump in 2019, has been one of the most closely watched FOMC members.Waller, alongside fellow Fed Gov. Michelle Bowman, dissented at the last Fed meeting in July, during which the FOMC held rates steady, preferring a 0.25% basis point cut.

The Fed's current interest rate target is 4.25% to 4.50%. Waller has expressed that he thinks the Fed's policy rate should come down to 3%, notably lower than what interest rates are now, but still higher than the 1% level that Trump has floated.

Federal Reserve Vice Chairwoman for Supervision Michelle Bowman is also a potential Trump pick for Fed chair. She voted alongside Waller for lower rates and was appointed this year to the supervisory role by Trump. She was previously appointed to the Fed board by Trump during his first term.

She said this week that her views on lower interest rates haven't changed since the last Fed meeting.

“The story is out there, and that's that. I haven't changed my views,” she told Bloomberg.

Kevin Warsh is a former member of the Fed Board of Governors who served from 2006 to 2011 and has been a prominent name in the world of finance and economics for quite some time.

Former President George W. Bush nominated him to the Fed board in 2006, and he served in the influential role under both Bush and former President Barack Obama. A big chunk of his time at the Fed overlapped the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession. After leaving the central bank, Warsh worked as a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.

In a recent Fox News appearance, he indicated he wanted to see rates move down.

“The Fed has the policy mix exactly wrong — it has a big balance sheet, like we're in the ‘08 crisis or the 2020 pandemic, and has rates that are too high,” Warsh said. “It needs to shrink the Fed balance sheet and cut interest rates. In so doing, Main Street can get a much lower cost of credit.”

Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett is also one of the top names being floated to lead the central bank.

Hassett served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2017 until 2019 and then as a senior adviser to the president on economic issues for a few months in 2020. Hassett was a professor at Columbia University in the early 1990s before going to work as an economist on the Fed board.

Hassett has critiqued the Fed under Powell for holding interest rates steady. The Fed has not cut rates once since Trump entered office, and Hassett said in July that he thinks interest rates should be about 1.5 percentage points lower.

Former Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard has indicated an openness to being picked as Fed chair. Bullard served as president of the St. Louis Fed from 2018 until his departure in 2023.

Bullard said during a Bloomberg appearance on Friday that he thinks interest rates could be lowered a full percentage point going into 2026, but he would “want to go slowly in order to watch the data.”

POWELL SIGNALS RATE CUTS ARE COMING

Other candidates are reportedly in the mix, too, and it appears that Trump is still weighing several options.

Without real reform, Americans might just end up eating more junk food.

Both batches of french fries that my family had for dinner were from the frozen-food aisle. They appeared nearly identical when cooked, one batch faintly darker than the other. And we all noticed: Those bronzed fries were exceptionally tasty. My toddler devoured a small mountain of them. They left a meatiness on my tongue, as if I'd eaten them alongside a steak. After my husband unblinded the taste test, I realized that, in a way, I had. The paler fries had been cooked in avocado oil, and their more delicious counterparts in beef tallow. Damn, I thought. The MAHA fries are amazing!

They weren't, of course, actually produced by the Make America Healthy Again campaign; both bags were from Jesse and Ben's, a frozen-french-fry brand whose tallow fries predate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s tenure as secretary of Health and Human Services. Jesse and Ben's, like many food companies, had already released so-called clean-label products, which cater to long-standing wellness trends such as avoiding artificial ingredients and added sugar—trends that overlap considerably with the MAHA approach to food.

Now companies are capitalizing on some of Kennedy's favored dietary principles—including his assertion, which is refuted by most nutrition experts, that beef tallow is a healthy substitute for seed oils—by further overhauling the branding and recipes of their products. Unfortunately, MAHA-washing groceries in this way won't make Americans any healthier. It might even change our diets for the worse.

Many product labels and ad campaigns decry ingredients on Kennedy's hit list—besides seed oils, it also includes high-fructose corn syrup and artificial food dyes and flavors—and showcase those he deems healthy. This summer, Sam's Club started selling beef-tallow-fried chicken strips. A brand of seed-oil-free instant ramen launched in August and is available at Kroger. This spring, PepsiCo relaunched its “Simply” line, which sells versions of snacks such as Cheetos and Doritos that are made without artificial flavorings and dyes; it later announced plans to extend the line with new products. A company spokesperson told me in an email that Lays and Tostitos will have no artificial colors or flavors by the end of the year. PepsiCo is investing in products without artificial dyes and flavorings “to make it easier for everyone to find snacks and drinks they feel good about,” the spokesperson told me. “The Make America Healthy Again movement has sparked important dialogue, and we share the belief that the food system should evolve—responsibly, at scale, and grounded in science and consumer trust.” Meanwhile, Coca-Cola announced that it would sweeten its sodas with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup. President Donald Trump, who said he had previously discussed the change with the company, thanked its leaders; Kennedy subsequently thanked Trump.

Of course, fried chicken, instant ramen, soda, and chips share a certain inherent junkiness. Even without their shocking-orange hue, Cheetos are mostly empty vectors for salt and fat. A 12-ounce bottle of Mexican Coke still contains more than three-quarters of the added sugar that the FDA says an adult should limit themselves to in a day. MAHA-washing therefore “misses the bigger picture of the food landscape,” which is characterized by heavily processed food, fast food, and sugary drinks, Marie Bragg, a population-health professor at New York University, told me.

These reformulations may have some benefits; as my colleague Nick Florko has written, artificial food dyes in particular are both unnecessary and probably not great for health. But at best, the changes championed by the MAHA movement will likely yield marginal health improvements, Alyssa J. Moran, a director at the University of Pennsylvania's food-policy laboratory, told me. Research has long shown that the most harmful elements of junk food are high levels of salt, saturated fat, and sugar, combined with minimal fiber and nutrients—not fructose, seed oils, or trace amounts of additives. Despite widespread concern resulting from studies linking high-fructose corn syrup to obesity in the 2000s, the evidence that it is less healthy than other forms of sugar is weak. Seed oils have repeatedly been shown to be not only safe to consume, but healthier than animal-based fats such as butter and beef tallow, which are rich in saturated fat and are linked to higher risk of heart disease. As I read the nutrition labels of my frozen fries, my heart spasmed: The beef-tallow version contains seven times more saturated fat than the avocado-oil kind.

Read: America stopped cooking with tallow for a reason

Unfortunately, Americans have proved themselves to be suckers for packaging that conveys a food's healthiness, Bragg said. Shoppers are willing to pay more for food labeled “all natural” and prefer produce marked as “pesticide-free.” One study that Moran co-authored found that parents are more likely to give their kids sugary drinks labeled with images of fresh fruit than similar products without those images. People tend to falsely believe that Oreos labeled “organic” have fewer calories than their conventional counterparts, and that the cookies can be eaten more frequently, even if they are pointed to labels showing that both options are nutritionally identical. They are also more likely to forgo exercise if they choose an organic dessert over a conventional one. All of this bodes poorly for American shoppers, who seem likely to eat more of the MAHA-washed junk foods that will still contain just as much salt, saturated fat, and sugar.

These issues do not concern food companies, whose primary mission is, of course, to sell food. Jesse Konig, one of Jesse and Ben's co-founders, told me that the company was pursuing taste, not health, when it started selling tallow fries, in 2024. “We're restaurant guys, not doctors,” he said. The labels on my packages of Jesse and Ben's fries, however, noted that the company doesn't use conventional seed oils, because they “leave you feeling icky and inflamed,” referencing a common health claim made by seed-oil critics.

Other companies are more outspoken about changing their products for the purpose of health. Mike's Mighty Good describes its seed-oil-free ramen as “wholesome,” and similar instant-ramen products as “low-quality junk food.” Real Good Foods launched its tallow-fried chicken because customers kept asking for a “seed-oil-free solution,” Rikki Ingram, the company's chief marketing officer, told me. Compared with conventional products, she said, the brand's tallow-fried chicken offers health advantages unrelated to its lack of seed oils: more protein, fewer carbohydrates, and no highly processed flour.

Read: America is done pretending about meat

Changes such as these make good business sense. A company that agrees to, say, phase out food dyes from soft drinks improves its public image. It also courts a relatively affluent audience, says Trey Malone, an agricultural economist at Purdue University. MAHA-washed foods are likely to be more expensive, in part because reformulating products is costly; companies aren't trying to market those goods to people already struggling to afford conventional food. Mike's Mighty Good seed-oil-free instant ramen costs more than $3 a cup on its website; its conventional counterparts can be 99 cents or less apiece. At Walmart, a bag of Simply Lays costs nearly three times as much as regular Lays. The rise of MAHA has been good for Jesse and Ben's business, Konig told me. Both the avocado-oil fries—which tick MAHA's seed-oil-free criterion—and the beef-tallow version have been hits with customers, but recent public discussion about beef tallow especially has “generated a lot of curiosity,” he said.

To Kennedy's credit, he's never called french fries a health food. MAHA's vision of an ideal food landscape is one where people eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and minimally processed food (in addition to beef tallow and raw milk). Kennedy has long condemned processed foods and the companies that make them for poisoning Americans. Earlier this month, he lauded states for announcing plans to restrict SNAP recipients from using the benefits to buy candy and soda. Yet so far, his dealings with food companies themselves have been fundamentally friendly: asking them to voluntarily phase out food dyes, congratulating Coca-Cola for its commitment to sugar as a sweetener.

If Kennedy shies away from using the government's real power, he could blow a genuine opportunity to overhaul America's food landscape. Food companies have enormous power over what we eat and could effectively nudge Americans toward healthier habits, Bragg said. In the mid-aughts, for example, companies such as Campbell's, Heinz, and Kraft committed to reducing salt levels in foods, including in breads, cold cuts, and cheese. It worked: From 2009 to 2018, the amount of salt in packaged food decreased by 8.5 percent. This outcome was partly driven by voluntary goals set by the National Sugar and Salt Reduction Initiative, a nongovernmental organization. The companies, however, also faced threats of regulation from the federal government if they did not comply. In 2016, the FDA proposed its own salt-reduction guidelines, further pressuring the food industry. “There has to be a threat of mandatory policy,” Moran said. “Otherwise, we're just going to continue to see them making these changes around the margins that are very unlikely to meaningfully impact health.”

Read: A ‘MAHA box' might be coming to your doorstep

Meanwhile, Kennedy's HHS hasn't instituted or threatened any binding regulations on food companies; indeed, it seems strongly opposed to doing so. A leaked draft of the second MAHA report, a document outlining HHS's policy strategy that has yet to be finalized, explicitly details plans to deregulate food and agriculture. “The Trump administration has initiated a robust food policy agenda to Make America Healthy Again, from phasing out artificial food dyes to updating Dietary Guidelines for Americans to reforming the ‘Generally Recognized as Safe' Standard,” the White House spokesperson Kush Desai told me in an email. (Under Kennedy, the FDA has so far revoked the authorization of one dye, Red 3. Formal changes to GRAS have not yet been announced.) “Every stakeholder in this movement—from parents to food companies to physicians to farmers to restaurants—has a role to play to transform how Americans view and make decisions about our health and nutrition.”

The superficial changes that companies have made to align with MAHA's goals offer a glimpse of what could change if Kennedy were willing to enforce his more science-backed policy proposals. But as things stand, HHS is attempting to clean up America's food supply with a spray bottle. What it really needs is a power washer.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

As college athletes' status shifts, so does the experience of school sports.

This is an edition of The Wonder Reader, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a set of stories to spark your curiosity and fill you with delight. Sign up here to get it every Saturday morning.

College athletics were once casual and fun, more like a club sport than a serious endeavor. But “over the past 75 years, NCAA sports has become ever more professionalized,” Marc Novicoff wrote recently. “Football and men's basketball began to generate eye-watering sums of money, incentivizing colleges to invest more resources in them.”

Now, recent court cases have allowed athletes to get paid by advertisers, fans, and their schools. As college athletes' status changes, both their careers and the experience of college-level sports are starting to look different. Today's reading list explores the meaning of school sports.

Fighting back against the Trump administration means they start to look more like activists.

Practicing science in the United States has become more politically fraught in the past seven months than it has ever been in this country's history. As the Trump administration has fired vaccine advisers, terminated research grants in droves, denied the existence of gender, and accused federal scientists of corruption while publicly denigrating their work, the nation's leaders have shown that they believe American science should be done only on their terms.



As of late, some in the scientific community have been pushing back, organizing marches and rallies, publicly criticizing government reports and agency priorities, and quitting their jobs at federal agencies. Professional medical societies have banded together to sue the Department of Health and Human Services over Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s unfounded restrictions of COVID vaccines and dismissal of vaccine experts. Academic scientists have done the same, to fight for grant funding. Researchers are convening extragovernmental panels to evaluate evidence on vaccines; the American Academy of Pediatrics has published vaccine recommendations that deviate from the CDC's, and several states in New England are mulling doing the same. This week, for the second time, hundreds of HHS officials have signed a public letter criticizing the department's leaders for interfering with the integrity of their work.



And yet, these counterattacks may be ensnaring scientists in a catch-22. Their goal is to defend their work from political interference. “If scientists don't ever speak up, then the court of public opinion is lost,” one university dean, who requested anonymity to avoid financial retaliation against their school from the federal government, told me: Americans would have little reason to question the government's actions. But in retaliating, scientists also run the risk of advancing the narrative they want to fight—that science in the U.S. is a political endeavor, and that the academic status quo has been tainted by an overly liberal view of reality. “When you face a partisan attack, it's extremely hard to respond in a way that doesn't look partisan,” Alexander Furnas, a science-policy expert at Northwestern University, told me. “It's a bit of a trap.”



Many scientists prefer to view their work as largely severed from politics. But in practice, politicians control how science is funded and how its findings are codified into policy. Some science has also been actively coded as partisan: The existence of climate change has been publicly questioned by conservative groups; since the early days of COVID vaccines, skepticism of them has split along party lines. And studies show that trust in the scientific community has been eroding among conservatives since the 1970s. Still, for decades, science in the U.S. has enjoyed bipartisan support. Furnas's unpublished research, for instance, has found that over the past 40 years, Republicans have appropriated more money to science than Democrats.



But if any previous politicizations of science were matchsticks tossed onto embers, the Trump administration “has been pouring gasoline,” Azim Shariff, a social psychologist at the University of British Columbia, who has studied how the politicization of science influences trust in it, told me. Many of the administration's assaults have been openly political—its leaders have repeatedly criticized American research as riddled with problematic ideologies, and claimed that the Biden administration manipulated science for its own purposes. And it has treated academic centers of science as threats that must be forcibly dismantled. “There is virtually no part of science that is not seen as belonging to one side, particularly the Democrats,” the university dean told me. “Science in general has been cast as being the work of one party, while those of another party destroy the system as it exists.” (HHS and the White House did not return requests for comment.)



Government scientists in particular have usually stayed out of the political fray. The federal workforce is largely made up of rule followers, Anna Yousaf, a scientist in CDC's respiratory-virus division who signed her name publicly to this week's HHS letter, told me. (She and other federal employees I spoke with emphasized that they were talking in their personal capacity, rather than on behalf of their agency.) “In terms of feeling comfortable about this? I don't,” Yousaf said. But now these scientists' livelihoods are on the line, as well the scientific principles they've dedicated their careers to.



And many fear for their personal safety. Earlier this month, a man who had expressed “discontent with the COVID-19 vaccinations” fired hundreds of rounds at the CDC's headquarters, killing a police officer. The shooting, and the administration's muted response to it, was a major motivation for Fiona Havers, who recently quit her job at the CDC in protest of Kennedy's actions, to sign her name to the letter. Kennedy's inflammatory accusations about public-health officials—including calling the CDC “a cesspool of corruption”—have “endangered the lives of my friends and former colleagues,” she told me. (Kennedy's earliest response, a post on X, came the day after the shooting; two days later, HHS released the administration's only official statement to date. Neither acknowledged the role that misinformation about COVID vaccines may have played, and hours after HHS's statement, Kennedy publicly criticized the CDC's pandemic response, arguing that the government said “things that are not always true” to persuade the public to get vaccinated.)



Many of the scientists I spoke with for this story insisted that they didn't feel their actions were political—and expressed concern over them being perceived as such. Although they were fighting back against the government, they told me, their intentions are to advocate for evidence. That line feels especially important to hold, they said, as Kennedy and other political leaders repeatedly flaunt their disregard for facts and scientific consensus. “We have not made this political,” Susan Kressly, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics—which has sued HHS, boycotted meetings of its vaccine advisory committee, and continued to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for populations that the CDC does not—told me. “It is the politicians doing that.” Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association, one of the professional societies that has sued HHS, told me that he felt similarly. “People tend to think of us as very much left-leaning,” Benjamin said, but the APHA, like the AAP, identifies as nonpartisan. He and Kressly each pointed out that their society has criticized the government during both Democratic and Republican administrations. For example, both groups were among the organizations that, in 2024, called out the Biden administration for delaying prohibitions on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.



In the past, scientists have successfully engaged in advocacy without polarizing public perceptions of them and their work. And enough Americans object to the Trump administration's campaign against science that Floyd Zhang, an economist who has studied public attitudes toward science, told me he could see trust in researchers increasing now. His research has shown that engaging politics can hurt scientists: In 2020, after the scientific journal Nature endorsed Joe Biden for president, Trump supporters who were told about the endorsement lost trust in the journal—and in scientists in general. Researchers, he said, seemed to be speaking out of turn—Who are you, telling me how to vote? But he thinks what's happening in 2025 may play out differently. Scientists' advocacy—for themselves, their institutions, and scientific principles—should look like scientists staying in their lane, and fighting on behalf of science.



Still, some scientists are behaving more like political activists and politicians. The writers of the HHS letters understand that defending their idea of the department requires political allies: Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health and one of the signers of both letters, told me that a main goal of the public outcry is to stir up further congressional support. A social-media account run by anonymous NIH officials explicitly calls out the “rightwing billionaires” who are trying to corrupt their agency. And scientists and physicians have cited the Trump administration's actions as motivation in their run for Democratic congressional seats.



Their choice of party is not just a protest against this administration. Scientists, as a group, lean more Democratic and less Republican than the rest of the public, a trend that seems to have intensified in recent decades. Pediatrics—the subgroup of medicine that communicates most regularly with families about vaccines—is among the most left-leaning medical specialties.



Already, public opinion on the Trump administration's siege on science divides along party lines. An April poll from the health nonprofit KFF showed that a majority of Republicans supported Trump's massive cuts to staff and spending at federal health agencies, whereas nearly all Democrats opposed them. (Another, more recent survey, from the Civic Health and Institutions Project, noted more muted enthusiasm from Republicans—but still found that more Republicans approved of Trump's attacks on science than did not.) More Republicans than Democrats support slashing funding to universities, too. And 41 percent of Republicans say that HHS's recent changes to vaccine policy will make people safer, compared with just 4 percent of Democrats.



Whatever the scientists' intentions, their actions may inadvertently bolster the Trump administration's case that scientists represent a particular liberal worldview. Shariff, the social psychologist, has found in his research that—even when politicization aligns with their own beliefs—“people don't like to see their science politicized,” he told me. “They lose trust in it.” That decline in trust, Shariff predicts, will concentrate among those on the right, who “will see science as more politicized than they did before,” he said, “because it's taking a side.”

 If that happens, the administration could leverage the validation of public opinion as permission to escalate. Trump and his appointees have loudly asserted that their vision for science in America is the correct one, representing truth rather than politics. In their view, the problem originated with the scientists who allowed ideology to infiltrate their thinking, fell prey to the distortive influence of industry, and discouraged the public from doing “your own research.” They seem ready, too, to blame scientists for the ongoing fracas. In July, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya sat down with some members of his staff to discuss the letter they had signed, calling for a restoration of the agency's scientific integrity. After a fairly cordial meeting, Bhattacharya's staff invited him to join them at a pro-NIH rally—perhaps even speak, Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the National Cancer Institute who attended the meeting, told me. “That appeared to anger him,” Kobrin said. Bhattacharya declined and stood to leave, adding, “I'm disappointed that you are politicizing this.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The billionaire space race is a dangerous fantasy.

The billionaire owners of Space X and Blue Origin have competing visions of a space-based future. Elon Musk wants a self-sustaining settlement on Mars as a backup for humanity in case the Earth gets destroyed. Jeff Bezos wants us to move heavy industry and all polluting industries to space to save Earth's climate, and envisions a trillion humans living in space.

Meanwhile, the United States and China are locked in a race of their own for dominance of space, with Chinese advancements far outpacing America's. The nuclear-wielding superpowers could wind up competing over territory on the moon and Mars.

Mars, for all its flaws — and there are many, including radiation, dust storms, and unbreathable air — is the only planet in our solar system that's a candidate for settlement. Its day and night cycle closely resembles Earth's, its dramatic temperature swings are moderate compared to other planets, and it contains the basic building blocks of life.

But the science journalist, author, and astrophysicist Adam Becker says it's just not worth it.

His recent book, More Everything Forever: AI Overlords, Space Empires, and Silicon Valley's Crusade to Control the Fate of Humanity, challenges the fashionable ideologies guiding tech leaders today, including long-termism, effective altruism, transhumanism, and space colonization.

As Becker puts it, it's about “the horrible ideas that tech billionaires have about the future that they're trying to shove down our throats, and why they don't work.”

Becker told Today, Explained co-host Sean Ramewaram why he thinks Mars is worth exploring for scientific inquiry, but not as a Plan B for Earth.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

So, you think Mars is a horrible idea?

Mars is a horrible idea. Mars is a terrible place; it's awful. There's nothing to breathe. You'll die of cancer if you hang out there for too long because it's covered in radiation. The dirt is poisoned. The gravity's too low. It gets hit with asteroids more often than Earth does. There's no biosphere. There's nothing to eat. There's nothing to breathe. If you hung out on the surface of Mars without a spacesuit, you would asphyxiate while the saliva boils off your tongue.

But you're an astrophysicist, author, and journalist, which means at some point you were a young child who dreamt of space. And part of the dream of space is Mars, right?

When I was a kid, I thought that the future was in space. I watched a lot of Star Trek because I'm a huge nerd, and a young growing nerd needs to consume healthy amounts of Star Trek in order to grow up to be a big, strong nerd. When I was a kid, I thought of Star Trek as a documentary about the future. Not literally a documentary, but I thought, “Yeah, this is what we're shooting for; this is what we want. We want to be in space, that's where the good future is.” And then I grew up.

Notably, there weren't a lot of billionaires on Star Trek, or they didn't talk about it, at least. 

No. In fact, what they talked about was that there was no money.

So, you grow up, and you see the intersection of space and money, and you change your mind about how you feel about space? Or at least Mars.

I love space. I did a PhD in astrophysics for a reason. I think that space research and exploring space with robots and satellites is amazing. But seeing billionaires turning space into another status icon for the ultra wealthy? It's gross.

Musk talks about Mars as if it's the inevitable future of humanity, that going to Mars is a project to save humanity like some giant philanthropic effort, and it's just nonsense. He says we have to go to Mars in case there's a disaster here on Earth, and we have to put a million people on Mars by 2050, and they have to be able to survive even if the rockets from Earth stop coming.

I'm like, dude, that is not happening. Mars is awful, and there is nothing that could happen to Earth that would make it a worse place than Mars. You could have an asteroid hit as bad as the one that killed off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. And the day that that happened, which is the worst day in the history of complex life on Earth, was a nicer day than any day on Mars in the last few billion years.

What about the Bezos argument for space colonization? 

I will say one nice thing about one billionaire: Jeff Bezos at one point made fun of Musk for promoting Mars. He's like, Mars sucks. I'm like, yeah, you know what? Jeff Bezos is right. Mars does suck. It's everything he said after that that was a problem. Because Bezos also has a specific vision for space. He says we need to go out into space to live in hundreds of thousands or millions of enormous space stations so we can have a trillion humans living in space in a couple of centuries.

And before you tell us what you think of that idea, we see a lot of this in the science fiction that we love to watch, from Star Trek to Interstellar to 2001: A Space Odyssey.

Absolutely. But science fiction is fiction. It is a set of stories that we tell not to predict the future, but as a setting to explore some questions about being human. One of the great science fiction authors of all time, Ursula Le Guin, said that science fiction is not a guide to the future.

Like any good millennial, there are tweets that live rent free in my head, and one of them is the Torment Nexus tweet, where it says: Science fiction author: “In my book I invented the Torment Nexus as a cautionary tale.” Tech company: “At long last, we have created the Torment Nexus from classic sci-fi novel Don't Create the Torment Nexus.”

“We should be focusing on actually making this world a better place. Mars is not hope. It's not even a fantasy. It's a delusion.”

I agree that science fiction can give us something to aspire to, but it's not the literal technology in the science fiction stories. Those things are narrative devices, like warp drive. We shouldn't aspire to warp drive because — just going to throw this out there as a physicist — that ain't happening.

One of the things I love about Star Trek is it shows a future to aspire to in terms of how the people relate to each other and the kind of world that they've built, independent of the technology. Star Trek was groundbreaking, even in the original series, in showing a diverse group of people on an aspirational mission of exploration and self-actualization, and working together as friends to explore the world that we live in. That is a future to aspire to.

That is not what Bezos has in mind. Bezos's idea is to put a trillion people in space, and he says he wants this because if we stay here on Earth in a few centuries, we're going to run out of resources and run out of energy. And he's right about that. If you assume the current rate of constant growth in usage of energy, then a few centuries after that, you're using all of the energy output of the sun.

But what you're saying is there's an alternative, and that is to not use all of our resources.

Yeah, or at least to safeguard them more wisely and use them in a more sustainable way. But Bezos wants perpetual growth in energy usage per capita. He's used that specific phrase. He wants each individual person to use more and more energy forever. And then he talks about how if we had a trillion people, there'd be a thousand Mozarts and a thousand Einsteins. What about the Mozarts and Einsteins that are living and dying in poverty right now?

It sounds like, for all you disagree with these tech billionaires when it comes to Mars or space colonization, we all have to agree that life on Earth is not infinite. Our sun, the source of life here on Earth, will eventually die. I know it's very far away. But we made it to the moon, and making it to Mars feels like it could be a step in the right direction. 

When I sat on the steps of the Air and Space Museum here in Washington, DC, and asked people whether we should go to Mars, they didn't talk about Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. They talked about the idea that space is infinite, and as a human race, it's something we should pursue. Do you really think that we should skip the stepping stone, just because these guys have some wrongheaded ideas about why we should be taking that step in the first place?

I don't think Mars sucks because the billionaires want to go there. I think Mars sucks and the billionaires want to go there. And why do they want to go there? Well, they're not particularly original guys. Mars has been in our cultural psyche for a very long time, and so has the idea of sending the human race out into space.

I think, instead, we should be focusing on actually making this world a better place. Mars is not hope. It's not even a fantasy. It's a delusion. It is not a place where we are going to find our fate, unless that fate is painful death.

You don't even see a reason to go there so that we can experiment with what it would be like to live on another planet long term? You don't even see a use for that because it might teach us something about the actual moonshot that we discover in a hundred or a thousand years, which is there's some planet in some distant galaxy that's just like home.

If we find a planet around another star, even in our own galaxy, forget distant galaxies, that's just like home, we're not going. It's not happening. The speed-of-light limit is a hard stop. We are not going. And no one is coming to save us. I find that hopeful. We have to save ourselves.

There's a story that I think is apocryphal; toward the end of his life, somebody asked the great architect and visionary R. Buckminster Fuller if he was sad that he was going to die without ever having gone to space. And his answer was, “We're in space.” We live in space! And we live in the most special and amazing place in space.

This is a place that we evolved to live, and everything about it is so well suited for us, and it's not just the distance of the planet from our sun. It's not just the mix of gases in our atmosphere. It is everything about this biosphere.

We can eat the fruit off the trees. We live in a place where food literally grows on trees. It's awesome! This is an amazing place, and we should continue to learn about the universe that we are a part of as we build a better home for ourselves here where we belong.

The White House says South Park is irrelevant. Its record-breaking ratings tell a different story.

South Park is back, and the show's creators are going full force on their jabs at the Trump administration. Three episodes in, the show's world-building centers fully around President Donald Trump and the colorful characters in his administration, with scathing parodies of figures like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President JD Vance.

While Matt Stone and Trey Parker are known for directing crude jokes at Democrats and Republicans alike, South Park's latest season is already hitting record ratings with an especially unrestrained critique of the Trump administration. Since the new season launched, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers has tried to dismiss the jabs, saying that South Park “hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.”

South Park's latest season is launching in the context of interesting times for Comedy Central's parent company, Paramount Pictures. Paramount has been under intense scrutiny from the Trump administration after settling a lawsuit with the Trump administration over their news magazine show 60 Minutes. Since then, the Trump administration oversaw Paramount's deal with Skydance, which requires CBS to hire an ombudsman to root out “bias” at the network.

Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram spoke with Brian Stelter, chief media analyst at CNN, about how South Park's latest season is taking aim at the Trump administration, and how the show's creators are navigating the context of their parent company seemingly buckling under the Trump administration's scrutiny.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Are you now, or have you ever been, a fan of South Park?

I would call myself a passive South Park fan. If I saw it on Comedy Central, I would enjoy it. But now, in the past month, I am an active fan. I'm seeking out new episodes.This show has defied the odds. It's almost 30 years old and suddenly more relevant than ever.

How did it defy the odds?

By speaking truth to the ultimate power right now. You know, the creators of South Park have always hated bullies, and they seem to believe Trump is the biggest bully of them all. The very premise of the first episode of this new season is about Trump targeting the media.The character Eric Cartman is angry that NPR has been forced off the air. From the very first seconds of the new season, you know that this show has something to say.

You also see how South Park Elementary is being transformed due to Trump's actions. This is a dramatic exaggeration of what's happening in real life, but it is true. When Trump is introduced in the show, you see him fighting with the Prime Minister of Canada over tariffs. But most memorably you see him getting in bed with Satan.

I'm gonna use some words I don't typically use on the show right now to describe that particular scene, because Trump derobes. Before you even see who he is about to get into bed with, we see that he has a micro penis. How do they follow that up?

The most ruthless jokes in the second episode were about Kristi Noem. They were about that old scandal involving her shooting a dog on her farm. You saw her over and over again in this episode shooting at dogs. This episode was really personal in the way it targeted Noem, showing her face maybe falling apart, pushing this idea that she was overusing Botox or other face fillers. Also, there's the idea that she cares so much about photo ops and PR, she's always out there dressing up in various outfits, posing for photos and videos. And as always, there are elements of truth to these critiques or satires.

It is true that Noem has tried really hard to be front and center, very visible, playing to the cameras, going out on tours, appearing in the field, showing that she's doing the work, so to speak.

Noem did not take this episode in stride. She said, “It's so lazy to make fun of women and how they look.” For Noem, this was personal, this was ugly. And she wanted to be on the record about it.

Is this the first time this show has gone after Donald Trump and his administration?

No, but it is by far the most direct, the most vicious. Back during Trump's first term in office, there was this storyline where one of the teachers at the school, Mr. Garrison, was becoming president and over time acting more and more Trump-like. This served as a way for the creators of South Park to ridicule Trump and to speak out about some of his behaviors and conduct in the first term. But this was not nearly as direct or aggressive as what we're seeing now.

I guess it's not that big a surprise that South Park would go after Donald Trump when he is Donald Trumping harder than he is ever Donald Trumped before.Yes.But they're not even sparing their parent company in these new episodes, right?

Matt and Trey are like a lot of creators in that they love to poke fun at the parent company when they can. The timing of this new season has been really extraordinary because Paramount was in the final days of this protracted, politically tortured merger approval process when the new season premiered.

So you literally had this anti-Trump episode, sticking it to the administration, putting the president in bed with Satan, airing on cable at the same time that the administration is having to review and approve this merger.

The second episode of the season aired on a Wednesday, and then on a Thursday the new Paramount took shape. The merged company, Paramount and Skydance, came together. There was this big formal press conference on Thursday around lunchtime in New York City and the new CEO David Ellison took questions from media reporters about his grand hopes and dreams about this new company.

I said to him, “So what about this South Park problem? You know, what are you gonna do about this problem? Do you view it as a problem?” Ellison's response was really telling. He started out by saying he's a huge fan of the show. He's been a fan of South Park for his entire adult life. He's 42, and he then went on to praise Matt and Trey as being really unique, talented creators. And he said to me, they are equal opportunity offenders, and they always have been.

So I think Ellison was saying: They're not just targeting Trump because they're a bunch of lefties who wanna attack the Republicans. They have always called out people on the left and on the right. They're equal opportunity offenders. I think he was trying to differentiate South Park from late night shows like The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, which was recently canceled. I think he was trying to say, these two creators are special. They are one of a kind, and they're gonna be protected by Paramount.

Obviously the other context here is the new owners of Paramount had just struck a five-year deal to exclusively stream South Park on the Paramount Plus streaming service. This five-year deal is worth well over a billion dollars. For the creators of South Park and for their production company, this is a huge vote of confidence in South Park as a tent pole of the future of Paramount. The whole idea makes a lot of sense when you think about it. South Park has a library of 325 episodes going back to the 1990s. This is a really valuable library in the streaming era, because people like to go back and watch episodes from 10 or 20 years ago. These episodes have a really long shelf life. That's why Paramount was willing to fork over so much cash.

I think this might be where some people get confused, because you've got everyone from Brown University to Meta to CBS and Paramount settling with the president, making donations to the president's inaugural committee. And then you've got Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who work for CBS or do business with Paramount Plus, not only going for the president, not only making fun of his administration, his own manhood, but making literally a billion dollars while doing it. How are they able to get away with something that seemingly no one else is right now?

This might be a case of business actually trumping politics. For the Paramount Plus streaming service, loud franchises like South Park are crucial. They're more important now than they were 10 years ago, and they might even be more important 10 years from now.

They are the foundation of the house that David Ellison's trying to build. and he can't compromise. The difference here between South Park and Stephen Colbert is that The Late Show was losing money. So, yeah, Stephen Colbert is a staunch critic of President Trump, one of the loudest Trump critics on TV. He's been canceled. A lot of his fans worry it's for political reasons. CBS says it's purely for financial reasons, and in a way, South Park actually affirms the CBS claim.

Paramount keeps putting out press releases touting how well South Park is doing. The show is beating some of its very old records on cable. But more importantly, if you add up the cable audience and the streaming audience, you're seeing 5, 6, 7 million viewers tuning in for these new episodes. Those are the kinds of numbers that almost any creator would kill for, certainly creators of animated comedies.

He's calling it 'Macrohard.'","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-recreate-microsoft-software-companies-macrohard-with-ai-2025-8","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 02:26:00 GMT","

Elon Musk announced he wants to ""simulate"" software companies like Microsoft using only artificial intelligence. He's even got a name for the new venture: Macrohard.

Musk said in a Friday X post that his AI startup, xAI, is building a ""purely AI software company called Macrohard.""

""It's a tongue-in-cheek name, but the project is very real!"" he said. ""In principle, given that software companies like Microsoft do not themselves manufacture any physical hardware, it should be possible to simulate them entirely with AI.""

Musk didn't provide more details, and a spokesperson for xAI did not return a request for comment. A spokesperson for Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.

Brent Mayo, an engineer working for xAI, retweeted Musk's post.

Grok, Musk's AI, responded to comments on X and said that AI could theoretically replicate Microsoft's ""entire operations"" from coding to management, adding that the company is now hiring.

Documents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office also show that a mark for ""macrohard"" was filed on August 1 by xAI.

Doug Rettew, a trademark attorney who is listed in the application, did not return a request for comment.

The application lists a broad range of AI-focused goods and services for Macrohard, including ""downloadable computer software for the artificial production of human speech and text"" and ""downloadable computer software for designing, coding, running, and playing video games using artificial intelligence.""

Macrohard would be added to Musk's long lineup of ventures, which he either partially owns or operates. At the moment, Musk is simultaneously in charge of Tesla, xAI, X Corp, The Boring Company, SpaceX, and Neuralink.

The creation of Macrohard also comes as Musk pushes further into AI and robotics, including encouraging Tesla to invest in xAI. In a 2024 earnings call, Musk said that those thinking of Tesla merely as an auto company are holding ""the wrong framework,"" and called Tesla an ""AI robotics company.""

Musk has also been placing increasing emphasis on projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots.

The Republican-controlled Texas state Senate passed the party's new congressional maps overnight, completing a legislative odyssey that included significant Democratic delays and sparked a nationwide scramble over redistricting in the process.

The vote means the maps, which were designed to pad the Republican majority in the U.S. Congress, will go into effect when signed by Gov. Greg Abbott, a proponent of the plan who has been cheered on by President Donald Trump.

Democrats have promised to challenge the measure in court.

Trump initially led the calls for Texas to redraw its congressional map, saying his party is ""entitled to"" five more congressional seats from the state. That's what the maps intend to do: By redrawing congressional district boundaries in key cities as well as along the state's border, Texas will have 30 congressional districts that Trump carried last fall by a double-digit margin.

The GOP currently controls 25 of the state's 38 congressional districts.

Read more from NBC News:

Republicans have been adamant, and blunt, from the start of the process that their exercise has been a political one aimed solely at increasing their party's power in Washington, where the House is almost evenly balanced. Democrats need a net gain of just three seats in the 2026 elections to take the majority.

Democrats have accused Republicans of setting a dangerous precedent by not waiting until 2031 to redraw the lines, as is customary, and they said the new maps would hurt minority representation in the state, a charge their Republican colleagues denied.

Unlike the state House, where business ground to a halt earlier this month when dozens of Democrats fled the state to deny the body a quorum to move forward with legislation, forcing Abbott to call another special session, the Senate has not been stymied by those efforts.

The move drew swift condemnation from opponents of the measure.

""This is not democracy, this is disgraceful,"" State Sen. Sarah Eckhardt said on X.

Democrats had planned to push back the Senate vote into the morning Saturday in a last-ditch attempt to delay passage.

Earlier, State Sen. Carol Alvarado, leader of the Senate Democratic caucus, announced on social media that she planned to filibuster the bill with a long speech and intended to speak for several hours. But just when she expected to start, the Senate broke for a long dinner break.

When members returned, Alvarado never had a chance to filibuster because Republicans accused her of breaking Senate rules by attempting to fundraise off the coming filibuster.

Sen. Charles Perry said it ""appears to be potentially unlawful, at least unethical, using state resources for a campaign purpose.""

With Abbott poised to sign the new maps into law, the spotlight shifts to California, where Democratic lawmakers have their own proposal to redraw their state's congressional boundaries as political retribution for Texas' move. Unlike in Texas, where regular legislation is enough to change the maps, California Democrats' proposal must also be approved by the voters in a special election this fall in order to take effect.

India's foreign minister said on Saturday that trade negotiations with Washington are continuing but there are lines that New Delhi needs to defend, just days before hefty additional U.S. tariffs are due to hit. 

Indian goods face additional U.S. tariffs of up to 50%, among the highest imposed by Washington, due to its increased purchases of Russian oil. A 25% tariff has already come into effect, while the remaining 25% is set to be enforced from August 27. 

A planned visit by U.S. trade negotiators to New Delhi from August 25-29 has been called off, dashing hopes that the levies may be lowered or postponed. 

""We have some redlines in the negotiations, to be maintained and defended,"" Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said at an Economic Times forum event in New Delhi, singling out the interests of the country's farmers and small producers. 

India-U.S. trade talks collapsed earlier this year due to India not agreeing to open its vast agricultural and dairy sectors. Bilateral trade between the world's largest and fifth largest economy is worth over $190 billion. 

""It is our right to make decisions in our 'national interest',"" Jaishankar said. 

Analysts at Capital Economics said on Friday that if the full U.S. tariffs come into force and stick, the hit to India's economic growth would be 0.8 percentage points both this year and next. 

""The longer-term harm could be even greater as a high tariff could puncture India's appeal as a global manufacturing hub."" 

The Indian minister described U.S. President Donald Trump's policy announcements as ""unusual"". 

""We have not had a U.S. president who conducts his foreign policy so publicly as the current one and (it) is a departure from the traditional way of conducting business with the world,"" Jaishankar said. 

He also said Washington's concern over India's Russian oil purchases was not being applied to other major buyers such as China and European Union. 

""If the argument is oil, then there are (other) big buyers. If argument is who is trading more (with Russia), than there are bigger traders,"" he said. Russia-European trade is bigger than India-Russia trade, he added.

 The minister also said India's purchases of Russian oil had not been raised in earlier trade talks with the U.S. before the public announcement of tariffs.

Spain's booming economy is outpacing its European neighbors as tourism, foreign investment and immigration helps fuel growth.

The southern European country is still leading growth in the euro zone with annual gross domestic product forecasted to rise 2.5% this year, while the economies of France, Germany and Italy are respectively forecast to expand 0.6%, 0% and 0.7%.

Spain's GDP surpassed expectations in the second quarter, growing 0.7%, above a Reuters forecast of 0.6%. The growth was also higher than the previous three months, which levelled at 0.6%, data from the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE) showed.

""For the second year in a row, we will be the advanced economy number one in terms of GDP growth,"" Spain's Finance Minister Carlos Cuerpo told CNBC in April. 

""Spain is a great outlier now in terms of growth. It's also a great place to invest,"" he added.

The success of Spain's economy relies on high consumption and investment, as well as tourism, Next Generation European funds, and immigration.

""It's not just tourism, it's also non-tourism services. We're exporting more in terms of services to firms like IT, accountability services, financial services, than we're exporting in terms of tourism — 100 billion euros [$116.8 billion] with respect to 94.95 billion [euros in tourism]. So that's an element of modernization of the Spanish economy,"" said Cuerpo.

Despite this economic growth, several challenges await Spain, such as keeping pay in line with the rising cost of living, climate change, an ever more divided political scene and the fact the country has the highest youth employment rate in the EU.

""What is going to happen with tariffs and international trade, especially in an economy like Spain, where exports of goods have increased considerably over the last 15 years?"" said Cardoso.

""The second challenge is that the savings rates remains relatively high. A third source is this low investment rates. And finally, how to decrease the government deficit and public debt.""

Still, tourism in Spain represents around 12% of the country's GDP, as it benefits from the pandemic rebound, and cheaper prices compared to other Western European nations.

The sector's success has sparked backlash from local communities over the influx of people visiting historic and popular sites, particularly during the peak summer months. Last year in June, protesters in Barcelona were seen spraying travellers with water guns and shouting ""tourists go home.""

The sector can also count on its growing workforce of nearly 3 million people as of 2024, a progression of 9.7% compared to 2023.

Job creation is also supported by high immigration. While other European countries are closing their borders, Spain is planning to welcome nearly a million migrants over the next three years, through work visa schemes and the granting of residence permits to undocumented workers.

""90% of the increase in the labour force since 2021 comes from immigration,"" BBVA Research's Chief Economist Miguel Cardoso told CNBC.

""This is allowing the service sector to expand. This is keeping firms relatively competitive in terms of containing the increase in labour costs, and it's allowing, for example, the prices in services to remain relatively contained in a high inflationary environment.""

Las year, most people migrating to Spain came from Colombia, Venezuela and Morocco.

""Latin American economies, some of them are not doing relatively well, so there is this push factor. There is also the fact that immigration to the United States has become more difficult, and therefore people are turning around and seeing alternatives,"" added Cardoso.

Spain's economy has also been bolstered by the European Union's Next Generation EU funds which has made 163 billion euros available to Spain, through grants and loans. The country is the second biggest beneficiary of this pandemic recovery assistance, following Italy. 

Spain's Cuerpo told CNBC that 70% of the grants — 55 billion euros — have already been dispersed.

""This was a program that was designed in part to try to help with the recovery after the pandemic,"" said Cardoso.

""So the government prioritized investment projects that they already had a plan for, and therefore they are having a relatively low multiplying effect within the economy.""

Nonetheless, the Spanish government aims to use these funds in sectors such as non-tourism services exports, including renewables. 

Since investing in green energy in the 2000s, Spain has benefited from low energy costs and has seen less impact from the European energy crisis that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

""The increase in the renewable share in the electricity mix over the past five, six years has implied a drop of 40% in wholesale electricity prices,"" Cuerpo said. 

Low production costs are an attractive criterion for companies, particularly foreign investors, who also supply the sector.

Photovoltaics tracker company Arctech, founded in China in 2009, opened its European headquarters in Madrid in 2024. Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. It's a burgeoning renewable energy source that can lead to lower electricity costs.

""Spain is probably the location in Europe where the most PV has been done,"" Arctech's EU and NA Markets General Manager Pedro Magalhaes told CNBC.

""The solar ecosystem is really here [in Spain], from the junior engineer, all the way to the funds that are investing in these large assets.""

The company now boasts 17 branches outside China, and is planning to expand in Eastern Europe, as well as plans to diversify into storage solutions.

""Things are happening here. We use the port of Valencia to import and distribute to many locations in Europe,"" Magalhaes added.

Like Arctech, many foreign companies are planning to take advantage of the country's low energy costs.

Auto giant Stellantis teamed up with battery manufacturer CATL in late 2024, announcing plans to build a $4.3 billion lithium iron phosphate battery plant in Zaragoza, northeastern Spain.

Foreign direct investment in Spain is strong too, with the country ranking as the fourth most attractive country in the EU for investors. China alone declared it will be investing up to 11 billion euros in Spain in 2025, as it gears up for a record 33 new projects in the country. 

""When you look at where does that investment come from, the largest investor in Spain is U.S.,"" said Cuerpo.

""But we're also attracting investment from other parts of the world, including China, on specific sectors related to renewables, to sustainable mobility as well, and this is of course, always part of our economic security agenda.""

As fears of a slowing economy lurk in the background, some businesses are taking notice and bringing back so-called recession specials.

Look up the term ""recession specials"" through Google's search engine, and the list of results will include entries from the Great Recession nearly 20 years ago.

Consider this Grub Street article from 2008 slugged ""Recession Specials: Your Definitive Guide."" Or this 2009 story from The New York Times, which details the mealtime recession specials restaurants across New York offered as an act of survival.

Fast-forward to 2025 and a crop of establishments are once more hinting at a looming economic downturn.

Recession fears were heating up this spring as President Donald Trump rolled out a slate of tariffs in early April. The term ""recession indicator"" entered the vernacular of social media users as a tongue-in-cheek way of gauging a potential economic slowdown.

Businesses are now getting in on the joke as well. For instance, Brooklyn, New York coffee shop Clever Blend advertises a $6 gelato and espresso ""recession special.""

Wicked Willy's, a bar in Manhattan, got on board by offering a ""Recession Pop Party"" earlier this month, with one caption on an Instagram post declaring: ""The recession is BACK! Get ready to dance and party all night long!""

Market Hotel, a Brooklyn concert venue, advertised a similar event. ""From The Fame to Animal, Circus to Rated R, we're serving economic anxiety with a side of electro-pop, bloghaus, and auto-tuned glam,"" an Instagram caption for the event read. ""Dress like rent's due and you're dancing through it.""

But the trend doesn't just stop in New York. Super Duper, a burger chain with 18 locations across the San Francisco Bay Area, tapped in earlier this year with its own ""Recession Burger,"" a seasonal special introduced in the summer.

""THE ONE THING THAT DIDN'T GET THE INFLATION MEMO: Meet the Recession Combo, our new Seasonal Special,"" a post from Super Duper's Instagram reads. The meal includes a ""Recession Burger,"" fries and a beverage for $10.

The idea for the burger's name didn't necessarily come from a desire to cash in on the buzzword, said Ed Onas, Super Duper's vice president of operations. Instead, he said, the moniker was derived from the Depression-era origins of the Oklahoma-style smash burger, which aimed to stretch ground beef by adding lots of sliced onions.

But once Super Duper established the burger's name, the chain decided to offer a discounted ""Recession Combo"" for $10. This would save customers $5 from the normal price of the add-ons, Onas said.

""That's kind of where the name of the burger plays in … And we figured, we're calling it the 'Recession Combo,' why don't we just offer a deal that makes it a really good value for our guests?"" Onas told CNBC in an interview. ""Inflation has kind of been going on, and we figured it's a nice offer for a short amount of time for our guests.""

This extra-value combo meal was an exception for Super Duper, which normally doesn't offer such deals. The burger went viral in a local San Francisco subreddit, with a post gaining 1,400 upvotes and 170 comments.

""Obviously, we were happy about it. We didn't realize that it was going to get as much attention as it did,"" Onas said. ""We were happy, and our guests were happy, and at the end of the day, that's what it's all about.""

As a testament to the burger's overwhelming success, Onas told CNBC that Super Duper will be adding it onto its menu as a permanent fixture going forward.

These small businesses getting in on the trend could be a broader reaction to waning consumer confidence. Consider that the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index came in at 58.6 in August, down from a reading of 61.7 in July and reflecting a 13.7% change on a year-over-year basis.

This souring in sentiment has been driven primarily by concerns over trade policy, said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan.

""What's very clear from the consumer sentiment data is that consumers are broadly bracing for a slowdown in the economy and a deterioration — not just with inflation, expecting inflation to get worse — but they're also expecting businesses conditions to deteriorate,"" she said. ""They're expecting labor markets to weaken and unemployment rates to go up. And what you're seeing with these businesses could be a reaction to that.""

A lack of consumer confidence — and trust in income reliability — will ultimately lead to a pullback in spending, Hsu added.

""Young people are feeling just as bad about the economy as older folks, and in some months they feel even worse than older folks,"" she said. ""Across the age distribution, people agree that the trajectory of the economy has soured.""

A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.

The great wealth transfer is leading to a great real estate transfer, with up to $25 trillion in real estate owned by older generations that could get passed down — and fought over — in their families.

According to Cerulli Associates, $105 trillion is expected to be passed down by baby boomers and older generations by 2048. Real estate, including primary and vacation homes, as well as investment properties, is expected to be a large component. The silent generation and baby boomers own nearly $25 trillion in real estate combined, according to the Federal Reserve.

Yet with property comes conflict. Wealth advisors say handing down real estate is increasingly filled with both financial and emotional pitfalls for families, ranging from taxes and maintenance costs to disputes over ownership and usage. The straightforward solution is just to sell it and divide the proceeds.

""Some people want to retain the house and other children don't,"" said BNY Wealth's Jere Doyle. ""I can tell you, as a practical matter, there's going to be fights. There's going to be disagreements. You're not going to have the perfect situation.""

But lawyers and wealth planners say there are measures families can take to more effectively pass down real estate to minimize taxes, costs and family battles. Here are five secrets to successful real estate inheritances, whether it's an apartment on Park Avenue, a beach house on the Vineyard or a ranch in Montana. 

Passing down vacation homes is the most fraught, said Elisa Rizzo of J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Her clients often downsize their primary residences later in life, but families stay attached to their second homes.

""That vacation home, often for our families that are very mobile, becomes the centering place,"" said Rizzo, head of family office advisory at JP Morgan. ""The vacation homes are where people go, and they make really special memories with one another, whether it's a ski house up in Vermont or a vacation home on Nantucket."" 

Doyle advises against gifting long-held real estate before you die. If your heirs choose to sell the property, they have to pay capital gains taxes on the property's appreciation since the parents originally bought the property.

""If you give during your lifetime, the kids take your cost basis,"" said Doyle, senior estate planning strategist for BNY Wealth. ""One of the things that people have to bear in mind is that the senior generation probably didn't pay an awful lot for the property.""

There are ways to minimize the tax burden, such as using a qualified personal residence trust. However, if you can afford to wait, it is best to leave real estate to your heirs in your will or in a trust at death, according to Doyle. If the heirs later sell the property, they only have to pay capital gains taxes on how much the home has appreciated since they inherited it.

Rather than having the heirs own the property directly, lawyers recommend placing homes in a limited liability company and setting up a trust for the kids' benefit that holds interest in the LLC. 

These legal maneuvers protect assets in several ways. For instance, if a vacation home is rented and a tenant slips and falls, the heirs are not held personally liable for any damages. 

""Your other assets, stocks, bonds, are not subject to any creditors' claims,"" Doyle said.

It also shields heirs from the liabilities of their siblings, according to Dan Griffith, director of wealth strategy at Huntington Private Bank. For instance, if one heir files for bankruptcy, the LLC structure prevents the creditors from putting a lien on the shared home, he said. 

You can also save on transfer taxes by gifting interest in an LLC that owns the property rather than putting heirs' names on the deed, Griffith said. Since these fractional interests are illiquid, parents can claim a discount on the taxable value.

Parents can put rules in place with an operating agreement for the LLC. Clients can use the document to make sure the home doesn't end up in the hands of their children's spouses, which is a common concern, according to Northern Trust's Laura Mandel.

""Typically families want to retain these properties along the bloodline,"" said the chief fiduciary officer.

Parents can restrict an LLC interest from transferring to surviving or former spouses of their children. With a well-drawn trust, it would be difficult for the spouse to contest it in court, Mandel said. These operating agreements often include buyout provisions that allow the heirs to buy out the spouse.

Parents can also use the document to guide how the property is used, such as laying out how many holiday weekends each child gets, who has the right to redecorate or whether the home can be rented out or used for weddings.

Leaving these issues unaddressed can cause fights among siblings. Mandel recalled a set of four siblings with a large ranch out west that they rented out frequently. After complaints that the ranch felt like a ""VRBO,"" Mandel helped the siblings reach an agreement on how the property could be used.

Money is the most common trigger for family feuds, Griffith said. An inherited home can quickly become a financial burden unless the parents also set aside cash to pay for the upkeep. 

""What ends up inevitably happening there is that one person pays the bills, and then enormous resentment grows, because either that person has to ask their siblings or cousins for money and sometimes those people don't pay,"" he said. ""Or they say, 'Hey, I'm the one paying all the bills. How come I don't get to use this more often than any of the rest of you?'"" 

Doyle recommends that parents use liquid assets like marketable securities or take out a life insurance policy in order to endow the trust. This outlay makes it possible for siblings to hold onto the home even if they can't afford to share the expenses.

""In a lot of cases, you may have some kids that can afford to pay the maintenance expenses, and others can't, so how do you treat them equally?"" he said.

However, the operating agreement should still include a contingency plan for dividing expenses if the trust runs dry. This is especially important for waterfront homes that are expensive to insure or susceptible to erosion. 

Parents often assume that their children will want to keep the home, according to Mandel. However, even if heirs initially agree to, they may change their minds later. Perhaps they grow tired of sharing a home with their cousins or a death in the family changes the equation, she said. For instance, Mandel worked with a ranch-owning family where the only sibling with working knowledge of the property passed away unexpectedly, which upended the living siblings' plan to run the ranch. 

It's important to plan for the likelihood that some or all of the heirs will want to cash out. Doyle suggests creating buyout provisions that allow heirs to buy their siblings' LLC interest even if they don't have the liquidity, such as taking out a promissory note. The assets in the trust can also be used to buy siblings' interests in the LLC.

""What you've got to build into any plan is an understanding that people's circumstances and situations can and will definitely change,"" he said. ""Maybe they're going to have kids, or their job changes, or their health changes. Things change.""

This can be hard for parents to reconcile, but keeping heirs' hands tied defeats the purpose of a vacation home, Griffith said.

""If your grandchildren don't have any ties to this place, no one lives here, no one grew up here, nobody cares, then do you really care if they sell the place?"" he said. ""If somebody else who really does care about it gets to enjoy it, is that such a bad thing?""

 Bitcoin chased its range highs after the Federal Reserve hinted at a policy pivot during the closing speech of the Jackson Hole Symposium. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin surged 5% to $117,300 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at an upcoming interest rate cut, liquidating $379.88 million in shorts.

Analysts say the BTC “uptrend is back,” with the potential to hit $200,000 before the end of the year.

Bitcoin (BTC) took out the ask liquidity above $117,000 on Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential September interest rate cut during his speech at Jackson Hole.

BTC price rose more than 4% to an intraday high of $117,300 on Bitstamp from a six-week low of $111,600.

According to CoinGlass data, $379.88 million in short positions were liquidated, with Ether (ETH) accounting for $193 million of that total as it soared nearly 15% to $4,760. Bitcoin followed with $56.4 million in short liquidations.

Across the board, a total of $629.48 million was wiped out of the market in short and long positions, as shown in the figure below.

The sudden market recovery led to the liquidation of 150,217 traders over the period, catching many off guard as investor sentiment flipped to bullish.

The Bitcoin liquidation heatmap showed the price eating away liquidity above $117,000, with more than $259.5 million ask orders sitting between $117,000 and $118,000. 

BTC's swept lows below $112,000, providing traders with a good entry position, according to MN Capital Founder Michael van de Poppe.

Earlier in the week, van de Poppe told his X followers to be on the lookout for a sweep beneath the Aug. 3 low of $111,900 as a great area to accumulate.

“A small sweep took place and an immediate massive move upward on #Bitcoin,” he said in a X post on Friday, adding:

Fellow analyst Jelle said that it is likely that the Bitcoin price could retrace following today's pump, but one thing remains clear: “The market wants higher.”

It comes as several crypto industry participants recently shared forecasts for higher prices in the crypto market. Analyst BitQuant said on Monday that his cycle top target of $145,000 for Bitcoin was still in play throughout 2025.  

Meanwhile, Bitwise's head of European research André Dragosch said in Cointelegraph's Chain Reaction daily X spaces show on Monday that US President Donald Trump's move to allow crypto in 401(k) retirement plans could push Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of the year.

Oops, something went wrong

Skepticism over Wall Street's deepening role in Bitcoin remains strong among early adopters, according to Preston Pysh, co-founder of Bitcoin venture fund Ego Death Capital.

Key Takeaways:

Ego Death Capital's Preston Pysh says many early Bitcoiners see Wall Street's growing role as a move “in a bad direction.”

Institutional adoption through derivatives raises doubts about Bitcoin's ability to remain a true safe-haven asset.

While use cases are evolving, Pysh warns that institutional dominance risks sidelining the culture that built Bitcoin.

Speaking on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell, Pysh said many longtime Bitcoiners view the growing wave of institutional adoption as drifting away from the ethos that defined Bitcoin's rise.

“Part of that culture that brought it to where it is, is looking at where this is all going and saying no, no, no, no, this is all moving in a bad direction,” Pysh said.

Pysh noted that institutions engaging in “institutional-like things,” such as building out derivatives markets, raise questions within the community about Bitcoin's ability to remain the safe-haven asset it was designed to be.

“Am I being scammed, like all the other scams that preceded this wave?” he said, reflecting concerns shared by early holders.

The comments echo broader debates that have divided the Bitcoin community in recent months.

In July, analyst Scott Melker, known as The Wolf of All Streets, argued that Bitcoin had in part been “taken over by the very people it was created to hedge against.”

For Pysh, the culture that carried Bitcoin from an experimental idea to a trillion-dollar asset was built on individuals self-custodying their holdings and holding through steep downturns.

“Those are the people who made Bitcoin what it is,” he said, stressing that many of them now fear being sidelined as institutional players gain control.

Still, Pysh acknowledged that the network's use cases are evolving.

“I think that it's going to move in a direction where a lot of people use Bitcoin the way they wanna use Bitcoin, especially institutions, who are going to use it very differently to how individuals use it,” he said. “That's a difficult pill for people to swallow.”

The remarks come as institutional appetite for Bitcoin continues to rise.

A March report by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon found that 83% of institutional investors surveyed planned to increase crypto allocations in 2025, underscoring the scale of the shift now underway.

Bitcoin could be on track for a major rally this year, according to Leah Wald, CEO of SOL Strategies.

Last week, Wald said she sees the world's largest cryptocurrency potentially climbing to around $175,000 by year-end, a target she described as conservative compared to projections from other top investors and fund managers.

Longer term, Wald pointed to ambitious estimates suggesting Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030, underlining the growing conviction among institutional players.

Bitcoin recently touched highs of about $124,000, a level that would have seemed unrealistic just a few years ago.

Wald emphasized that Bitcoin forecasts are no longer confined to fringe speculation.

“Some of the smartest investors in the world, like Cathie Wood and others, and the way Larry Fink speaks about Bitcoin, point to projections that are astronomically high yet based on solid models,” she said.

ByBilly Bambrough,

Senior Contributor.

Bitcoin has rocketed to an all-time high this year, with its latest boom enticing a new wave of surprising and controversial new cryptocurrencies.

The bitcoin price has topped $124,000 in the last few weeks, lifting ethereum, Ripple's XRP and the wider crypto market to over $4 trillion for the first time as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk quietly confirms his “only” crypto.

Now, as Kanye West suddenly joins the crypto craze, Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff has admitted he got bitcoin and crypto wrong ten years ago, warning a coming dollar “crisis"" could propel crypto higher and joining some of the most bullish bitcoin price forecasters in sounding the alarm over the $37 trillion debt pile.

“Almost a decade ago I was the Harvard economist that said that bitcoin was more likely to be worth $100 than 100,000,” Rogoff posted to X. “What did I miss?”

Rogoff, who was also the International Monetary Fund's chief economist and has a new book coming out warning over the future of the U.S. dollar, pointed to a lack of ""sensible cryptocurrency regulation,"" bitcoin's appeal to the ""global underground economy,"" and U.S. president Donald Trump's embrace of crypto as spurring the bitcoin price higher.

However, Rogoff has also predicted the growing U.S. debt pile, which has ballooned to over $37 trillion this year, has raised “doubts about the U.S. dollar.”

“Over the medium and longer term, the dollar could lose market share to the Chinese yuan, the euro, and even cryptocurrency,” Rogoff wrote in a piece for Foreign Affairs.

“In the long term, a severe debt or, more likely, an inflationary spiral could send the economy into a lost decade, drastically weakening the dollar's position as the dominant global currency and undermining American power,” Rogoff wrote in the piece headlined, ""America's Coming Crash: Will Washington's Debt Addiction Spark the Next Global Crisis?""

This week, minutes from the latest Federal Reserve interest rate-setting meeting showed officials remain concerned about price pressures, though Fed chair Jerome Powell opened the door to cutting interest rates in September at his closely-watched Jackson Hole Economic Symposium speech, sending the bitcoin price—and other major cryptocurrencies including ethereum and XRP—higher while torpedoing the U.S. dollar.

“This is bullish for the front end of the yield curve and risk assets, where bitcoin is a fast horse in the race,"" Jessy Gilger, investment advisor at bitcoin financial services company Unchained, said in emailed comments.

""A dovish tilt could supercharge bitcoin's narrative as a hedge against fiat uncertainty, accelerating institutional accumulation and liquidity. While the mid and long end of the curve remain uncertain, bitcoin's sensitivity to macro signals means it's poised to ride any wave of optimism from rate cut expectations.”

Meanwhile, the most bullish bitcoin price voices in the crypto space have pointed to the growing U.S. debt pile as potential catalyst to send bitcoin sharply higher.

“I think we'll see $1 million per bitcoin by 2030,"" Brian Armstrong, the chief executive at bitcoin and crypto exchange Coinbase, posted to X.

Armstrong named increasing regulatory clarity, the president Donald Trump's bitcoin strategic reserve, and Wall Street adoption among other factors that include the U.S. debt‑to‑GDP ratio.

“The debt‑to‑GDP ratios are the thing to watch usually, I think,” Armstrong said in a conversation posted to YouTube with payments giant Stripe cofounder John Collison.

“I forget where we're at now—150 or 170 or something—but if you look historically, maybe when the British lost it or the Dutch, they were in the 200–250 range. So we're within sight of a pretty dangerous threshold, historically. It's hard to see where the political will is going to come from to do that, and I hope that bitcoin could be part of that solution.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","ETH Price Prediction: Traders Target $10K ETH Amid $400M in Ethereum Liquidations","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/23/ethereum-bets-see-unusually-high-usd400m-liquidations-as-some-now-target-usd10k-eth","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 06:50:09 GMT","

Ethereum's breakout past $4,800 triggered nearly $388 million in liquidations tied to the token in the past 24 hours, data shows, marking the heaviest flush across all crypto assets.

The wipeout was part of $769 million liquidated marketwide, with over 183,000 traders forced out of positions. The single biggest hit was a $10 million ETH swap order on OKX, an unusually high figure for the token, which is often second to bitcoin-based positions.

Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets.

A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher.

The move came as ether surged almost 15% to a record $4,885 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested rate cuts could arrive in September. Bitcoin lagged with a 4% gain to $113,000, while the CoinDesk 20 Index climbed 9%.

Analysts say the rally isn't just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street's preferred blockchain.

“Ether's new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,” said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk. “I would expect ETH to surpass $10k once we start to see stablecoin solutions being implemented for payments within the U.S.”

That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts. The year-to-date gain for ETH now stands at 45%.

SharpLink Gaming can repurchase up to $1.5 billion worth of common stock under a newly authorized repurchase program, the Ethereum treasury firm said in a blog post on Friday.

With a market cap of $3.5 billion, that would be almost half of the company's value, but Co-Chief Executive Officer Joseph Chalom described the program as a potential resource for instances when the company's shares trade a discount to its Ethereum holdings.

“In this scenario, the accretive course of action may be to repurchase our common stock,” he said in a statement. “This program provides us with the flexibility to act quickly and decisively if those conditions present themselves.”

SharpLink shares surged more than 15% on Friday to $20.87 amid a wider upturn in crypto-focused stocks, according to Yahoo Finance, as investors turned optimistic about the prospects of an interest rate cut following remarks by U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell. But SharpLink's stock price has swooned 24% over the past month even as Ethereum has gained ground. 

Ethereum was recently changing hands at $4,813, jumping more than 13% over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Earlier Friday, ETH set a new record high of $4,879 before retreating. The asset's price has increased about 35% over the past month.

Like most crypto treasury firms, SharpLink seeks to maximize shareholder value by growing the amount of Ethereum it owns per fully diluted share. When SharpLink shares trade at a premium to its crypto holdings, it can issue common stock to increase that ratio.

Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has used the tactic for years, but its premium has been substantially greater and existed far longer. On Friday, SharpLink had a so-called mNAV of 1.08, reflecting a slight premium, according to Ethereum Strategic Reserve.

SharpLink owned 740,000 ETH worth over $3.5 billion, as of Friday. Its corporate stash was around half the size of BitMine Immersion Technologies', which owned 1.5 million ETH that were worth around $7.3 billion. 

In the press release, SharpLink noted that the timing and amount of shares repurchased under its newly approved program will depend on market conditions. It's not obligated to purchase any shares whatsoever, and the initiative can be suspended at any time, it added.

Bitcoin's dominance may have peaked. Is Ethereum now the spark that ignites a full-blown altcoin season?

With Solana and XRP ETF speculation heating up, will liquidity rotate faster than investors expect?

Analysts warn that the biggest acceleration is still ahead. Could this be the most explosive altcoin cycle in years?

The cryptocurrency market is showing signs of rotation as Bitcoin cools after recent highs, with traders shifting their focus to Ethereum and mid-cap tokens. Analysts note the shift is a familiar pattern in the early stages of altcoin season, often marked by capital rotation from Bitcoin into Ethereum and, eventually, the wider market.

Ethereum's position has been reinforced by steady ETF inflows, while speculation over potential Solana and XRP exchange-traded products is adding to investor enthusiasm. The combined factors, some analysts argue, could accelerate a broad-based rally across digital assets.

Crypto analyst Lark Davis says the current setup resembles the classic structure of a market cycle. Historically, Bitcoin rallies first, followed by Ethereum outperformance, before liquidity flows into mid- and small-cap tokens.

 According to Davis, this rotation has already begun as Bitcoin dominance shows signs of peaking, signaling that capital is being redeployed into Ethereum.

Davis outlined a “playbook” for investors preparing for the next phase. Ethereum remains the primary trigger for a broader rally once it consistently outpaces Bitcoin. Solana, supported by ETF speculation and its expanding DeFi and NFT ecosystem, is positioned as a close contender. He also points to XRP, which could benefit if ETF speculation intensifies.

Beyond the major tokens, Davis highlights assets with reflexive economic structures, such as dYdX and Hyperliquid (Hype), both of which deploy buyback-and-burn mechanisms. Hyperliquid has already directed more than $1.3 billion of trading fees into buybacks, with dYdX, Jupiter, Raydium, and Chainlink pursuing similar strategies to bolster token demand.

Meme coins, often seen as speculative but highly liquid entry points for traders, also feature in his outlook. Recent rallies in tokens such as BONK, PENGU, and FART  illustrate how retail-driven flows can ignite quickly in this sector.

Lastly, the emerging tokens in the AI and gaming sectors may capture capital as new themes emerge.

While altcoin seasons rarely begin abruptly, Davis says the current environment with ETF flows, shifting dominance metrics, and early signs of capital migration suggests one of the most active cycles in recent years could be taking shape.

Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.

Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and select mid-cap tokens may see major growth as altcoin season matures.

Focus on Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and promising mid-cap or thematic tokens with strong adoption.

Ethereum leads for potential, followed by Solana and XRP, supported by ETF flows and ecosystem growth.

High-risk emerging tokens in AI, gaming, or innovative DeFi projects could deliver outsized returns over time.

Quantum computing is an evolution of classical computing, capable of solving problems that are competitive enough to break the existing cryptographic primitives upon which current blockchain systems are based. Popular schemes like RSA, ECDSA, and SHA-256 can be compromised by quantum algorithms (Shor's and Grover's), raising questions about the security and trustworthiness of blockchain-based applications in finance, healthcare, and supply chains. Many current approaches focus on isolated aspects of the blockchain, such as cryptographic primitives or key exchange, without a comprehensive strategy that can guarantee end-to-end security in the face of a quantum threat. Finally, traditional consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, centralization, and leader-selection bias. When the adversary has access to a quantum computer, these issues become significantly worse. In this paper, we present QuantumShield-BC, a modular blockchain framework incorporating post-quantum cryptographic signatures, quantum key distribution (QKD), and a novel Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus mechanism driven by quantum random number generation (QRNG) to address these challenges. QKD: The system supports tamper-proof key exchange, quantum-resilient consensus among validator nodes, and secure transaction signing. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that QuantumShield-BC achieves low consensus latency and high throughput, while providing perfect security against simulated attacks from Shor's and Grover's algorithms. The proposed framework eradicates the Sybil attack effectiveness up to 0%, eliminates replay and MITM vulnerabilities, and achieves an average throughput of over 7,000 transactions per second with 100 validators, orders of magnitude better than classical blockchain systems. The importance of each quantum part to the system's robustness is also demonstrated using an ablation study. With its unique ability to provide a post-quantum framework for high-assurance, general-purpose, scalable, and interoperable blockchain networks resistant to quantum-inspired attacks or quantum retrieval, QuantumShield-BC is practical for deployment in critical infrastructure and digital trust ecosystems where performance and a future-proof foundation are essential.

Quantum computers are advancing rapidly, posing one of the most significant threats to traditional cryptographic systems, which underpin the security of nearly all blockchains. Secure algorithms like RSA, ECDSA, and SHA-256 are at risk of quantum attacks using Shor's and Grover's algorithms in polynomial time. With the increasing adoption of blockchain in financial systems, healthcare, supply chains, and decentralized identity, researchers must also focus more on blockchain's inherent resilience to quantum-enabled attacks. Concerning quantum adversarial models, classical blockchains (even those augmented with modern cryptographic optimizations) cannot provide the same level of security.

Various researchers have explored some standard components of individual enhancement in post-quantum cryptography (PQC), quantum key distribution (QKD), and Blockchain technology enhancements. Carames and Lamas1 studied PQC schemes for blockchain; Gao et al. Quantum blockchain models presented by2 are based on the entanglement and DPoS mechanisms. Bhavin et al. Introduction of a hybrid model based on quantum blind signatures for security in healthcare3. Yet, these seem purely component-wise and fail to deliver insights into systematic, scalable, and modular quantum-safe solutions that span cryptographic, communication, and consensus-level quantum resilience.

This paper proposes a comprehensive blockchain framework, QuantumShield-BC, that fills these crucial blanks. This research aims to design, implement, and evaluate a post-quantum secure blockchain architecture comprising three critical components: post-quantum digital signatures for transaction signing and verification, QKD to provide secure peer-to-peer communication between all nodes of the network, and a new Q-BFT consensus mechanism based on QRNG to protect against malicious nodes. It is a scalable system that aims to counter key compromise, Sybil, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

The main contributions of this work are that (i) it integrates PQC, QKD, and QRNG in an end-to-end manner in a single blockchain protocol, (ii) it minimizes trust in random numbers via QRNG-based consensus and leader election that achieves strong security for random numbers, and (iii) it fosters the gradual introduction of PQC by modular, layered architecture that allows any underlying blockchains to be converted to post-quantum blockchain systems incrementally. A comprehensive evaluation based on extensive simulation is also conducted, reinforcing the research contributions by quantifying the system's underpinning against quantum attacks, performance benchmarking, and ablation studies.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the related literature on quantum-safe blockchain technologies, highlighting recent advancements and identifying research gaps. Section 3 presents the QuantumShield-BC framework, detailing its layered architecture, integrated quantum components, and proposed algorithms. Section 4 provides security benchmarking details. Section 5 presents experimental results, including the system setup, a comparative analysis with classical blockchains, security benchmarking against quantum attacks, a scalability assessment, and an ablation study of quantum components. Section 6 presents a detailed discussion of the findings and outlines the study's limitations. Section 7 concludes the paper and offers directions for future research.

The rise of quantum computing has intensified research into blockchain security, with a focus on quantum-resistant cryptography, secure key exchange, and consensus mechanisms. Existing works have individually explored post-quantum cryptosystems, QKD protocols, and blockchain enhancements. However, a gap remains in developing unified, scalable frameworks that integrate these components to address end-to-end security threats in the quantum era.

Quantum cryptography leverages quantum mechanical principles to ensure secure communication and data protection, forming the basis for quantum-secure blockchain systems. Studies have focused on the principles of quantum bits, quantum entanglement, and secure key generation for cryptographic resilience. Gnatyuk et al.4 created a safe PRNG for Q-trit cryptography, pointed out evaluation technique shortcomings, and made recommendations for future tool development. Lone and Naaz5. examined studies on quantum cryptography, emphasizing post-quantum cryptography and key distribution, pointing out problems, and making recommendations for further advancements.

EI-latif et al.9 proposed a quantum walk-based S-box technique for 5G-IoT security, highlighting the difficulties and potential applications of quantum cryptography in the future.

To counter the vulnerabilities of traditional cryptography against quantum attacks, researchers have proposed lattice-based and hash-based post-quantum cryptographic schemes tailored for blockchain applications. These include quantum blind signatures, secure hash functions, and digital signature algorithms that resist Shor's and Grover's algorithms. Lamas1 examined post-quantum cryptosystems to secure blockchains. One of the limitations is the difficulty of implementation. Cryptosystem performance may be improved in future development. Dhar et al.3 proposed a hospital blockchain architecture that utilizes quantum blind signatures to enhance data security. Future research might improve efficiency. Gao et al.10 suggested an anti-quantum blind signature system for blockchain, emphasizing its effectiveness, safety, and potential advancements in cryptography. Yang et al.11 evaluated Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), highlighting future efforts to improve security and highlighting gaps in existing research. Bansod and Ragha12 examined blockchain privacy technologies, identified issues, and suggested further study to mitigate and enhance privacy. Zeydan et al.13 presented a post-quantum signature technique with potential for future scaling that addresses quantum weaknesses in secure IoT blockchain networks. Radanliev14. examined IoT security, finds weaknesses, and suggests lattice-driven cryptography for post-quantum IoT security that is immune to quantum errors. Leng et al.15 analysed post-quantum hash-based signatures for Internet of Things security, emphasizing issues, suggestions for further study, and implementation strategies. Tosh et al.16 addressed the avoidance of misuse and effective integration with current technology by proposing quantum-resistant chameleon hash algorithms for redactable blockchain. Zhang et al.17 examined SIKE's susceptibility to side-channel attacks, provided a defense, and recommended future security enhancements. Nejatollahi et al.18 examined the energy-efficient polynomial multipliers of post-quantum cryptography, highlighting speedups and providing ideas for future design improvements. Banupriya and Kottilingam19 examined potential solutions to blockchain privacy concerns, such as deterministic keys and quantum-resistant algorithms, with a focus on Bitcoin.

Additionally, NTRU lattice-based identity proxy signatures have been investigated as quantum-resistant replacement methods for proxy signatures that secure identity delegation and privacy on blockchains20. Such schemes are significant for role-based access control in privacy-preserving decentralized systems.

QKD-based blockchain communication protocols provide tamper-proof key exchange using quantum channels. Some studies integrate QKD with classical post-quantum encryption to form hybrid cryptographic frameworks, enhancing blockchain security during transmission.

Dhar et al.21 investigated how to improve IoT multimedia security using blockchain and quantum cryptography. Computational limitations are one type of limitation. Future research could improve security techniques. Gupta et al.22 explained the blockchain's susceptibility to quantum computing, suggested a quantum-secure electronic voting mechanism, and outlined potential future research areas. Radanliev23 examined how AI can improve quantum cryptography, discussed potential integration for digital security, and addressed related issues.

Unlike previous quantum-secure blockchain designs that target isolated protocol improvements using post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for transaction signing or quantum key distribution (QKD) for key distribution, QuantumShield-BC enables an integrated, modular design integrating post-quantum cryptography, quantum key distribution, and quantum random number generation into a cohesive protocol stack, in contrast to2,10,24, which study isolated components or limited hybrid models concerning secure classical communication, QuantumShield-BC proposes a fully integrated framework for quantum integrity in support of large-scale validators, providing seamless integration of tamper-proof QRNG and hybrid PQC-KEM key exchange protocols. The leveraging of QRNG for both leader selection and validator authentication (post-quantum) enables its consensus layer—Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT)— to become inherently resistant to Sybil and predictability attacks. Compatibility with these strengths, along with performance benchmarking (such as 7000 + TPS while testing with 100 validators), demonstrates clear architectural and operational superiority over past quantum-aware systems.

Furthermore, employing post-quantum threshold cryptography has also been suggested to achieve stronger multi-party privacy in blockchain consensus settings83, a direction that aligns with the quantum-secure multiparty computation used in our Q-BFT protocol.

This paper proposes a QuantumShield-BC framework to provide end-to-end protection for blockchain systems in the quantum age. It incorporates post-quantum digital signatures at the protocol layer, quantum key distribution (QKD) at the network layer, and a Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus mechanism based on quantum random number generation (QRNG) to provide end-to-end quantum attack resistance, scalability, fairness, and high transaction throughput.

One of the challenges it poses for blockchain technology is that quantum computing has a disruptive capability concerning the cryptographic techniques we use, primarily traditional cryptographic methods such as RSA and ECC. However, the main disadvantage of all these classical methods is their vulnerability once large-scale quantum computers become available and can perform quantum attacks, such as Shor's algorithm, which efficiently breaks widely used public-key encryption schemes. It has led to the need for quantum-resistant blockchain architectures that ensure the security and safety of these decentralized methodologies against any future threats. Abstract: QuantumShield-BC is a quantum-secured blockchain framework that combines post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD) to provide real-time security and resilience against quantum attacks over the long term.

The growing reliance on blockchain technologies for secure transactions, digital identity management, and decentralized applications (DApps) further underscores the necessity of quantum-resistant mechanisms as timelines for such attacks get shorter. However, this dependence on classical encryption introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in existing blockchain security models, as classical encryption can be solved in polynomial time with the aid of quantum computers. QuantumShield-BC addresses this issue by utilizing lattice-based post-quantum digital signatures that can be seamlessly integrated into smart contracts, thereby significantly lowering the barrier to usage on existing protocols while ensuring signature security, even in a quantum adversarial setting. Moreover, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is implemented by creating a secure peer-to-peer communication channel to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Deterministic PRNGs pose a significant attack vector for classical blockchains, as they often lead to nonce prediction in digital signatures, which attackers can exploit. QuantumShield-BC further introduces quantum random number generation (QRNG), providing cryptographically secure random values for generating transaction hashes and executing smart contracts, as well as for the consensus mechanism, significantly augmenting entropy and security. This introduces random deviation, thereby strengthening the protection of classical cryptography against more predictable attacks.

System architecture of QuantumShield-BC with PQC, QKD, QRNG, and Q-BFT integration for secure blockchain operations.

In Fig. 1, in addition to securing each transaction, QuantumShield-BC replaces standard proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-work (PoW) models with a Quantum-enhanced Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus layer, bringing the same transactional protection to consensus mechanisms. By ensuring that validator nodes use post-quantum cryptographic authentication, adversaries cannot forge post-quantum authentication signatures or influence the consensus mechanism. The framework incorporates post-quantum secure multi-party computation (MPC) to preserve the resistance of node selection and block validation against classical and quantum-based cyber attacks.

By fusing classical cryptography robustness with quantum-safe innovations, QuantumShield-BC embodies a transformation in the landscape of blockchain security. The framework combines encryption with lattice-based digital signatures, QKD-secured communication, QRNG-enhanced randomness, and a quantum-resistant consensus protocol to create a next-generation, tamper-proof blockchain ecosystem. With the continued evolution of quantum technology, the fundamental need for a quantum-secured, decentralized system is heightened. In an era where quantum adversaries pose a potential risk, QuantumShield-BC provides the ideal future-proof solution, safeguarding the integrity of blockchain applications across multiple domains.

Workflow diagram of QuantumShield-BC depicting end-to-end transaction processing with PQC-based signing, QKD communication, QRNG-driven leader selection, and Q-BFT consensus.

The workflow diagram of QuantumShield-BC, shown in Fig. 2, illustrates the complete lifecycle of a blockchain transaction secured against quantum threats. It begins with a user-initiated transaction digitally signed using post-quantum cryptography. The transaction is then securely transmitted across blockchain nodes using quantum key distribution (QKD). Validators authenticate the transaction using lattice-based signatures, followed by QRNG-based leader selection to ensure unbiased consensus initiation. The Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) protocol is executed for multi-party consensus, and upon reaching agreement, the block is finalized and appended to the blockchain. The user receives a confirmation, completing the secure and quantum-resilient transaction flow.

Table 1 presents the key notations used throughout the QuantumShield-BC framework, defining symbols related to transactions, cryptographic operations, consensus mechanisms, quantum processes, and validator interactions in blockchain.

The QuantumShield-BC builds a quantum-safe layer on top of the BC, protecting it from quantum adversaries across all three layers (transaction validation, block generation, and ledger) using PQ cryptographic methods. This layer provides the option to replace traditional cryptographic primitives with post-quantum digital signatures and merge quantum-safe hash functions, aided by quantum random number generation (QRNG) to increase entropy in the blockchain. These changes further bolster the blockchain against key stealing, signature forgery, and entropy-based attacks that may become possible with the emergence of quantum CPUs.

Digital signatures are crucial in verifying the authenticity of a transaction and preventing third-party manipulation. Unlike classical cryptographic schemes like RSA or ECDSA, which rely on Shor's algorithm, QuantumShield-BC adopts a cryptographic stance when it comes to signing and verifying transactions, utilizing PQC algorithms such as CRYSTALS-Dilithium or Falcon post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) technology. The function for transaction verification is defined by

Where \(\:V\left(T\right)\) is the validity of the transaction, \(\:{S}_{k}\) is the post-quantum digital signature produced with the private key, and \(\:H\left(T\right)\) is the cryptographic hash of the transaction. The function \(\:{Verify}_{PQ}\) insures that the transaction is signed using a cryptosystem resistant to quantum computations before being included in the blockchain.

The security of the blockchain relies on more secure block generators, which allow data integrity to be secured while still maintaining immutability. QuantumShield-BC: Each block in QuantumShield-BC is tied to the previous one using a quantum-resistant hashing function. The hash of a block can be computed using a post-quantum secure hash function, such as SPHINCS + or Keccak, providing resistance to Grover's search algorithm. The computation of the block hash is given by

Where \(\:H\left({B}_{n}\right)\) is the hash of the block \(\:{B}_{n}\), \(\:{B}_{n-1}\) is the hash of the previous block, \(\:{T}_{n}\) stands for the transactions that the block contains and \(\:{S}_{n}\) is a digital signature of the block. The function \(\:{Hash}_{PQ}\) secures the hash process against quantum computing attacks.

One of the fundamental weaknesses of classical blockchains is the use of deterministic pseudo-random number generators (DPRNG), which can be vulnerable to entropy prediction attacks. To mitigate this, QuantumShield-BC leverages quantum random number generation (QRNG) to introduce high-entropy randomness in cryptographic operations, such as block generation and nonce generation in smart contracts. We define the quantum entropy function by the following:

Where \(\:{R}_{Q}\) is the quantum entropy, \(\:QB\) is the quantum bits, seqi is the probability for each quantum state. This feature guarantees that roll results are at random, free from the weak state seeds.

QuantumShield-BC also interfaces to a quantum-resistant Merkle tree for secure ledger storage. It is interesting to note that classic Merkle trees are based on hash-based proof of eligibility and could not be trusted alone in the presence of a quantum attack. The approach replaces traditional construction with a post-quantum Merkle tree where each node is signed through a lattice-based DS. The Merkle root calculation is given by

Where \(\:{M}_{R}\) is the post-quantum Merkle root, and \(\:{L}_{1}\parallel\:{L}_{2}\dots\:\parallel\:{L}_{n}\) are the signed transaction leaves. By combining post-quantum signatures at every node layer, the transaction integrity is preserved against quantum adversaries.

QuantumHyperledger/QuantumShield-BC distinguishes itself as a tamper-resistant and robust decentralized ledger via the QRL by combining post-quantum digital signatures, hash hardening algorithms, and QRNG-based entropy. These improvements keep the blockchain operational and resilient to quantum-computing attack vectors as they emerge, meaning that QuantumShield-BC is the future of decentralized, secure applications.

QuantumShield-BC enhances blockchain security by utilizing Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure peer-to-peer communication, thereby protecting the cryptographic keys exchanged between blockchain nodes against quantum attacks. Figure 3 illustrates that classic key-exchange mechanisms in cryptography, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman, lack security against Shor's algorithm in traditional blockchain networks. QKD, on the other hand, can provide the generation and secure transmission of cryptographic keys based on quantum states, for which eavesdropping and key compromise are not feasible.

Quantum key distribution (QKD) process flow illustrating secure key exchange between blockchain nodes using quantum states and classical reconciliation.

Protected by the no-cloning theorem and superposition in quantum mechanics, 7 QKD allows for an intercept-resilient exchange of cryptographic keys. QuantumShield-BC utilizes the BB84 protocol to exchange a key between the sender and receiver blockchain nodes via quantum state-encoded, polarized photons. The key exchange can then be mathematically described.

Where \(\:K\) denotes the obtained secret key, \(\:{Q}_{S}\) is the quantum state transmitted by the sender node, and \(\:{Q}_{R}\) is the quantum state received by the recipient node. If the eavesdropper attempts to tap the quantum channel, the organization of the quantum state collapses, informing the communicating parties.

After the Quantum Key is exchanged successfully, it is applied to build a safe symmetric encryption channel between blockchain nodes. By encrypting, the transmitted blockchain data is kept private and secure. The encryption with the key generated by the QKD is defined as.

Where \(\:C\) is the encrypted message, \(\:{E}_{K}\left(M\right)\) is encryption with the secret key \(\:K\), and \(\oplus\)it is the XOR operation. The recipient decrypts the message with

Here \(\:{D}_{K}\left(C\right)\) is the cryptographic decryption operation. Since the encryption key is securely exchanged by using the QKD, the communication is secure against quantum decoherence attacks.

QuantumShield-BC also included post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to supplement QKD in addition to secure key exchange. QKD provides the guarantee of key confidentiality, and post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEM), such as Kyber and FrodoKEM, are applied to achieve hybrid security for blockchain data exchange. The hybrid encryption, combining QKD and lattice-based encryption, aims to protect against vulnerabilities in one security layer by ensuring the other remains secure. Denote the hybrid key agreement function by

where \(\:{K}_{H}\) is the hybrid secret key for secure communication, \(\:{K}_{QKD}\) is the secret key generated from qa quantum source, and cap K sub cap P cap Q cap C is the key from a post-quantumkey encapsulation mechanism.

QKD-authentication based mechanisms also add a layer of security to blockchain communications. Validator nodes in the blockchain network are authenticated by quantum-secure key exchange method and can defend against Sybil and identity cues attacks. A key QKD-authenticated identity hash is generated in each validator node, as follows:

Where \(\:{H}_{V}\) is the identity of the authenticated validator, \(\:{ID}_{V}\) is the unique identifier for the node, and \(\:K\) is the QKD-derived key. This allows consensus and block validation only by nodes that are quantum-authenticated.

By using QKD for secure key exchange, QuantumShield-BC Se mitigates the risks associated with classical key exchange protocols and adds layer of post-quantum encryption. QKD is integrated with hybrid encryption schemes and QKD-authenticated node validation to secure the blockchain against classical and quantum attack fronts. With this, QuantumShield-BC establishes a channel for communication that will remain for the decentralized networks of the blockchain's future.

Theoretically unbreakable, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) provides secure key exchange; however, practical implementations raise several issues. The significant challenges include the high hardware costs of quantum photon sources, detectors, and synchronization systems, as well as channel loss over long distances, particularly when the channel is a fiber-optic or free-space link. In addition, the scalability of QKD is limited for blockchain networks because of the requirement of individual quantum channels among the nodes. QuantumShield-BC addresses these concerns, supporting a modular integration that allows hybrid PQC-KEM mechanisms to supplement QKD in situations where its deployment is not feasible. Future improvements will investigate satellite-based QKD or trusted node relays to eliminate losses caused by distance and increase the practical applicability of the system.

Introducing a quantum-secure consensus, QuantumShield-BC enhances the security of the blockchain by utilizing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), as illustrated in Fig. 4. Classic consensus schemes, such as PoW and PoS, are based on cryptographic algorithms that are susceptible to quantum attacks (e.g., Shor's algorithm, which can crack RSA and ECC). It is ensured that the proposed Q-BFT-based protocol is secure for block validation and transaction verification even in the quantum environment.

Quantum byzantine fault tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus flowchart showing validator authentication, QRNG-based leader selection, and multi-party consensus execution.

In QuantumShield-BC, each validator node is required to verify transactions with a post-quantum cryptographic signature before contributing to the consensus. The authentication is formed using lattice-based digital signatures, so malicious parties cannot forge the validator credentials. The function is the validator authentication function assigned by where quale lector.

where \(\:{V}_{node}\) denotes the validator at the position 1the validator's authenticating status at the position, \(\:{S}_{v}\) is the post-quantum digital signature produced by the validator at the 11 st position, and cap H of cap B is the cryptographic hashrecord of the candidate block. This prevents the Byzantine Army from joining the consensus by only accepting quantum-resistant signatures to verify a block.

This consensus decision function collects multiple signatures of validator nodes, and the block is appended to the blockchain only if a large enough set of quantum-authenticated validators accept it. This is mathematically modeled as:

Where \(\:{C}_{V}\) is the consensus declared voting result, \(\:{T}_{i}\) is any individual transaction of a block, and \(\:{P}_{i}\) is the post-quantum public key of the validator \(\:\:i\). QiatumShield-BC can defend against attacks such as quantum Sybil attacks and signature forging by implementing this quantum-secure aggregation process.

QuantumShield-BC uses quantum-resistant threshold cryptography to guarantee that block finalization is not possible unless a sufficiently large number of validators participate. The block confirmation horizon can be derived as follows:

Where \(\:{Q}_{C}\) is a quantum consensus threshold, \(\:{V}_{{node}_{i}}\) is the verification status of single validator nodes, and \(\:\tau\:\) is a minimum threshold required for consensus. This maintains decentralization in the blockchain and thwart quantum bloc adversaries attempts to effect block finalization.

Leader election in consensus protocols is generally susceptible to predictability attacks. QuantumShield-BC addresses this challenge by using QRNG for unbiased leader election. The leader selection function that uses QRNGs has the form of

Where \(\:L\) is the leader node, \(\:{R}_{Q}\) is the quantum-generated random number, and nn denotes the total number of the validators that participate in the procedure. Thanks to the use of QRNG, QuantumShield-BC makes sure leader election mysterious and non-manipulatable.

In QuantumShield-BC (QSB)-QRNGs are not augmentations of conventional PRNGs(2), but separated quantum entropy sources based on physical behavior of quantum systems. QRNGs, however, take their source of randomness from fundamentally unpredictable quantum processes (such as photon phase noise, radioactive decay, or vacuum fluctuations), in contrast to PRNGs, which rely on deterministic algorithms and seed value(s). Such sources are physically uncloneable and therefore they cannot be mimicked so that they not only quantum mechanically sounds more secure than classical random numbers, but they are not just probabilistically secure (cloning the classical data is a typical classical attack), but they are also physically verifiable. To avoid being attacked by entropy predictability, QuantumShield-BC employs QRNG generated values for leader selection, nonce generation and consensus randomness. Randomness is fed through quantum-proof extractors (such as Trevisan's extractor) for entropy extraction and uniformity, making the output cryptographically usable (see20 for specifics on the entropy extraction process).

For additional security, the architecture includes a hybrid consensus validation scheme with the quantum multiparty computation (QMPC). This way, several validators can cooperate in validating transactions and without revealing too much about the sensitive cryptographical information. The centralized verification process over multi-party consensus is defined as

.

Where \(\:{M}_{C}\) is the consensus verification output, \(\:{S}_{i}\) is the post-quantum digital signature of the validator \(\:i\), and \(\:H\left({T}_{i}\right)\) is the CM-Hash of the transaction \(\:{T}_{i}\). QuantumShield-BC achieves privacy preserving and quantum-safe consensus validation by using QMPC.

By combining QRPoA with PQC-threshold signature, QRNG leader selection, and QMPC consensus validation, QuantumShield-BC is secure against classical and quantum adversarial attacks. This method allows decentralized blockchain systems to achieve the tamper-proof and security in the quantum scale era because of large-scale quantum computer, and it makes QuantumShield-BC as a future next-generation blockchain consensus framework.

The development of the quantumshield-bc prototype takes place in several stages to enable a step-by-step integration of quantum-safe blockchain components. In addition to a post-quantum cryptography (PQC), the OmegaLedger prototype includes quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum-secure consensus algorithms, and quantum random number generation (QRNG) as solutions to boost blockchain immunity against quantum attacks. At each stage, critical security concerns, that is transaction verification, block creation, consensus assurance, and secure p2p communication, are addressed. The main development steps of the prototype are described below.

The first phase of development focuses on incorporating post-quantum digital signatures to transition from classical signatures, RSA and ECC, to post-quantum. QuantumShield-BC uses lattice-based cryptographic methods CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon by signing transactions, ensuring secure transactions. Where the transaction validation function is the formulation of:

Where \(\:V\left(T\right)\) is the transaction validity, \(\:{S}_{k}\) is the post-quantum digital signature of the sender of the transaction and \(\:H\left(T\right)\) is the cryptographic hash of the transaction. This prevents non quantum-resistant signatures from being added to the blockchain.

In the second stage, the communication between nodes are being insured using QKD, where nodes use QKD to share an encrypting/decrypting key for the block chain communication. This also closes weaknesses in traditional key exchange schemes like Diffie-Hellman and RSA. The pairwise key agreement between nodes is specified as:

Where \(\:K\) is the parties' secret key, \(\:\:{Q}_{S}\) is the quantum state sent by the sender, \(\:{Q}_{R}\) and is the received quantum state of the receiver. If the key is intercepted by an enemy, he will change the quantum state; therefore, key compromise will be noticed immediately.

To derive tamper-proof block generation, QuantumShield-BC employs quantum-resistant hashing for connecting the blocks together within the blockchain. The block hash calculation uses SPHINCS + or Keccak, which are resistant to Grover algorithm attacks. The hash function used to create a block is defined as:

Where \(\:H\left({B}_{n}\right)\) is a hash to the newly created block \(\:{B}_{n}\), \(\:{B}_{n-1}\) to the previous block, \(\:{T}_{n}\) to the transactions in the block; and \(\:{S}_{n}\) is the post-quantum block signature. This ensures that the data cannot be changed and that it will be resistant to quantum attacks.

The upcoming developments will be directed towards the implementation of Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT), a post-quantum consensus protocol that supersedes old-fashioned PoS and PoW mechanisms. It was also observed that validator nodes prove their identity with quantum-secure signatures before joining the consensus. The function for the validator authentication is defined as

Where \(\:{V}_{node}\) denotes validator certification, \(\:{S}_{v}\) is the post-quantum digital signature of the validator, and \(\:H\left(B\right)\) is the cryptographic hash of the block proposal. Only verified QSC validators are allowed to participate in the consensus.

To achieve the fair leadership selection in consensus, the Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) is implemented in order to remove the bias and predictability during the leader selection. We model the leader election as

Where \(\:L\) is the leader, \(\:{R}_{Q}\) is the random number generated by quantum, and \(\:n\) is the number of available validators. QuantumShield-BC relies on QRNG to achieve fair and tamper-free leader election free from pseudo randomness source such as pseudo-random number generator and pseudo-random counterparts.

The last stage comprises the installation of QuantumShield-BC prototype on a testbed for testing its security and performance as well as its defence to quantum attacks. The security of transaction verification, consensus and block generation is proven with quantum attack simulation on quantum computing simulator (i.e., IBM Qiskit or Google Cirq). The integrity of the global blockchain is decided by the multi-party consensus verification function, which is denoted as:

Where \(\:{M}_{C}\) is the consensus validation status, \(\:{S}_{i}\) is the digital signature of validator post-quantum \(\:i\), and \(\:H\left({T}_{i}\right)\) is the hash cryptographic value of transaction \(\:{T}_{i}\). This multi-party validation prevent any but quantum-secure transactions from entering the blockchain.

Incorporating PQ digital signatures, PKI free QKD, quantum-secure hashing, and QRNG-based consensus, the QuantumShield-BC prototype provides an ultra-resilient and temper-proof blockchain platform. By the systematic evolution and incorporation of quantum-safe technology into a blockchain, so that the blockchain is operational, scalable and robust against newly emerging quantum scientific threats, a future user facing quantum-safe blockchain 2.0 can be achieved.

This section presents the core algorithms underpinning the QuantumShield-BC framework. Each algorithm addresses a specific component of the system, including transaction authentication, secure key exchange, quantum-safe consensus, and randomness generation. Together, these algorithms ensure end-to-end quantum resilience, enabling secure, scalable, and tamper-proof blockchain operations in the presence of emerging quantum computational threats.

Post-quantum digital signature algorithm.

Algorithm 1 secures blockchain transactions using post-quantum digital signatures. It begins by hashing the transaction data and generating a signature with a private key using a post-quantum algorithm. The signature is then attached to the transaction and verified using the corresponding public key. This ensures that the transaction is authentic, tamper-proof, and resistant to quantum-based attacks.

Quantum key distribution (QKD) algorithm.

Algorithm 2 enables secure key exchange between blockchain nodes using quantum key distribution. The sender transmits quantum states, which the receiver measures using random bases. Through classical communication, both parties compare bases and retain matching bits to form a raw key. After error correction and privacy amplification, a final secure key is established, ensuring tamper-proof communication against quantum adversaries.

Quantum-resistant hashing algorithm.

Algorithm 3 generates a quantum-resistant hash for a blockchain block using post-quantum cryptographic functions. It concatenates the current block data with the previous block's hash to form the input. A secure hash function, such as SPHINCS + or Keccak, is then applied to produce a tamper-proof hash. This ensures the integrity and immutability of the blockchain ledger.

Transaction validation algorithm.

 Algorithm 4 performs transaction validation using post-quantum cryptographic techniques. It extracts the transaction and its digital signature, computes the hash of the transaction, and verifies the signature using the sender's public key. If the verification is successful, the transaction is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected. This process ensures that only authentic and quantum-secure transactions enter the blockchain.

QRNG-based nonce and randomness generation algorithm.

Algorithm 5 generates quantum-secure random numbers using a quantum random number generator (QRNG). It begins by producing a sequence of quantum bits, which are measured to obtain raw entropy. A randomness extraction function is then applied to refine the output. The resulting value provides true, unpredictable randomness used for nonce generation, leader selection, and other critical blockchain processes.

QRNG-based leader selection algorithm.

Algorithm 6 selects a consensus leader using quantum-generated randomness. A random number is generated via a quantum random number generator (QRNG) and mapped to a validator index by taking the modulus with the total number of validators. If the selected validator is active, it is assigned as the leader. This approach ensures fair, unpredictable, and tamper-proof leader selection.

Quantum byzantine fault tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus algorithm.

Algorithm 7 establishes consensus using the Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) mechanism. Each validator verifies transactions using post-quantum signatures and broadcasts its result. The system aggregates validator votes and compares them against a predefined threshold. If the number of valid votes meets or exceeds this threshold, consensus is achieved and the block is approved; otherwise, consensus fails and is retried.

Post-quantum multi-party consensus verification algorithm.

Algorithm 8 performs post-quantum multi-party consensus verification among validators. Each validator independently verifies transaction signatures using post-quantum cryptography. The results are securely shared and aggregated using quantum-secure multi-party computation. If all verifications are successful, consensus is confirmed. Otherwise, the transaction is rejected. This ensures tamper-resistant validation across distributed nodes in a quantum-secure blockchain environment.

Block finalization and addition algorithm.

Algorithm 9 finalizes and appends a validated block to the blockchain. It first checks whether consensus has been achieved. If valid, the block data is hashed using a post-quantum secure hash function and linked to the previous block. The finalized block is then added to the blockchain and broadcast to the network, ensuring integrity, immutability, and resistance to quantum-based tampering.

Quantum-aware network security algorithm.

Algorithm 10 secures validator communication using quantum-aware techniques. It begins by establishing a key via quantum key distribution, followed by validator authentication using post-quantum signatures. All messages are encrypted using the QKD-derived key. Replay and Sybil attacks are mitigated through QRNG-generated nonces and identity checks. The system ensures quantum-resilient, authenticated, and tamper-proof communication across blockchain nodes.

Performance Evaluation The performance of QuantumShield-BC is tested through a number of essential performance criteria to measure its security, efficiency, and scalability against quantum threats. The assessment considers transaction validation latency, consensus throughput, cryptographic entropy, and benchmark quantum resistance. These benchmarks guarantee QuantumShield-BC maintains high speed operation and uses post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) primitives, QKD, Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT), and QRNG.

One of the primary performance metrics is the transaction validation time, which measures the time to validate a transaction using post-quantum digital signatures as opposed to the case of standard signatures. The validation time \({T}_{v}\) of a transaction can be defined as

Where \(\:{T}_{Sign}\) is the time to compute a post-quantum signature, and \(\:{T}_{Verify}\) is the time to verify the signature based on the underlying post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) scheme. Since lattice-based signatures (e.g., CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon) increase the computational overhead as compared to ECC, we strive to choose PQC schemes with the least latency, to achieve the most efficient QuantumShield-BC.

Another essential metric to consider is consensus throughput, the number of transactions that can be handled per second and that are secure against quantum adversaries. The performance (throughput) of the Q-BFT consensus mechanism can be defined as

Where \(\:{T}_{Q-BFT}\) is the number of transactions (transactions per second), \(\:{N}_{T}\) is the number of transactions validated \(\:,\:cap\:T\:sub\:cap\:C\:is\:the\:total\:running\:time\:for\:forming\:a\)decision. Utilizing Quantum-Secure Multi-Party Computation (QMPC), the consensus mechanism ensures secure transaction validation, whilst minimizing the computational overhead caused by post-quantum cryptographic primitives.

QuantumShield-BC, in selecting specific PQC algorithms, makes a balance between computational efficiency and post-quantum security guarantees. We considered both CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon schemes as digital signatures, both of which are NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization finalists. CRYSTALS-Dilithium provides excellent security guarantees and high confidence in being resilient against lattice-based attacks; however, Falcon supports very small signatures with much faster verification speeds, making it more advantageous for high-throughput blockchain environments. We used Falcon for consensus authentication in our prototype, due to its fast signature verification time (1.5 ms per signature), and we opted for Dilithium for transaction signing, where the signature size constraint is less critical. The combination of the two reduces both speed and storage overhead used by the two to perform blockchain operations. We found that total conversion to Dilithium increases validation time by 18%, but this also improves resistance to some attacks based on side-channels17. These design choices exemplify how modular PQC algorithm customization can align security-performance trade-offs for real systems.

An entropy assessment of QRNG-based blockchain functions is conducted to evaluate the quality of randomness applied to leader selection, nonce generation, and cryptographic key generation tasks. The Shannon entropy formula determines the quantum entropy value, cap R sub cap Qalue, \(\:{R}_{Q}\), is determined by the Shannon entropy formula:

Where \(\:QB\) is the bit pattern ggenerated from the quantum, and p sub i is the probability distribution of the uantum state. Higher entropy values imply better randomness, increased security for cryptographic keys, and greater unpredictability in blockchain operations.

Equation (23) computes the Shannon entropy value derived from quantum bitstreams generated by a QRNG device. Here, the entropy H(Q)=\(\:-\sum\:_{i}{p}_{i}{log}_{2}\:{p}_{i}\) ​ quantifies the uncertainty of measured quantum states. Unlike classical bitstreams, the probabilities \(\:{p}_{i}\)​ are obtained from quantum state measurement results, ensuring they reflect hardware-derived unpredictability rather than algorithmic randomness.

In order to measure the quantum resistance of blockchain transactions, we analyze security by running simulations using Shor's Algorithm to compare the resistance of classical versus post-quantum cryptography. The time complexity for solving the cryptographic key with Shor's algorithm can be expressed as: $ where ta is the time to guess a while Shor's key is around Inf:.

Where \(\:N\:indicates\:the\:length\:of\) the cryptographic key in bits, since RSA/ECC keys will be broken in polynomial time by Shor's algorithm, QuantumShield-BC is based on post-quantum cryptographic primitives like Kyber, FrodoKEM, and SPHINCS + that are secure against quantum decryption.

Another relevant measure is the network overhead due to QKD-based encryption. However, QKD's secure key distribution may lead to extra bandwidth consumption, where cap O sub cap Q is the overhead factor.

Where \(\:{B}_{Q}\) denotes the bandwidth cconsumption of QKD-based encryption, a nd \(\:{B}_{C}\) denotes classical encryption. QuantumShield-BC is lightweight, and the overall communication efficiency is not degraded as QKD key exchange rates are improved and unnecessary quantum-state transmissions are suppressed.

The last evaluation measure is the CTT: the time it takes the network to agree upon a new block and place it on the blockchain. This is given by

Where \(\:{T}_{B}\) is the block confirmation time, \(\:{T}_{Comm}\) denotes the time for communication among validators, \(\:{T}_{Q-Rand}\) is the time for quantum-safe random value generation for leader selection and \(\:{V}_{C}\) is the number of the validators involved. The efficient block generation is one of the most essential requirements of the blockchain with a shorter block confirmation time and quantum resistance.

This allows QuantumShield-BC to be tested against the following performance measures, namely, transaction validation latency, consensus throughput, entropy test, quantum safety test, QKD-induced network overhead, and block confirmation time, to strike a tradeoff among security, efficiency, and scalability. These results support that the insertion of quantum-safe cryptographic features improves the resilience of blockchain-based networks against quantum threats with negligible performance degradation.

QuantumShield-BC provides a unique and functionally integrated quantum-secure blockchain structure which incorporates post-quantum digital signatures, secure communication through QKD, leader election based on QRNG, and a new Q-BFT consensus protocol in a single framework. In contrast to earlier efforts to improve the security of respective quantum individual layer (PQCs only/QKDs only) QuantumShield-BC is a an integrated layered solution with protocol-level modularity, consolidated quantum cryptographic implementations on each layer (transaction, network and consensus layer, respectively) with an extensive use of quantum secure systems inherent across the multiple layers of the infrastructure. By validation, the prototype embodies a tangible performance benefit over 7000 TPS at 100 validators, and full quantum resistance to Sybil, replay, and MITM attacks, verified through detailed ablation studies quantifying the contribution of each quantum component.

The main novelty of QuantumShield-BC is the use of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) signatures instead of classical digital signatures, which helps secure transactions against quantum adversaries. Most existing blockchain systems rely on the ECDSA, a cryptographic algorithm whose security can be effectively compromised by applying Shor's algorithm. Including lattice-based signature schemes, CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon, makes the framework resistant to compromise through quantum-enabled keys. These post-quantum signatures exhibit computational infeasibility for signature forgery but enable efficient transaction validation, thereby preserving blockchain security against the post-quantum threat.

It also features the first-time integration of quantum key distribution (QKD) to achieve safe transport over single-mode fiber-based node-to-node communication by preventing eavesdropping or interception of encryption keys. Quantum computers decrypt public-private key cryptography used in traditional blockchains. Based on quantum mechanics, QKD guarantees that eavesdropping on cryptographic keys disturbs their quantum state, making such efforts detectable. This innovation allows blockchain nodes to securely send encryption keys to each other, creating a quantum-resistant peer-to-peer communication mechanism that cannot be attacked by a man-in-the-middle (MITM).

The second main element of innovation of QuantumShield-BC is the Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus mechanism that strengthens the fault tolerance of blockchain validators. Sybil Attack Resistant — Classic consensus protocols like PoW and PoS are sybil attack resistant (if an attacker has the majority of computing power or stake, they can process any valid transaction). Using post-quantum digital signatures and multi-party secure computation, Q-BFT guarantees that only quantum-authenticated validators can form consensus. This ensures that adversaries with quantum capabilities cannot control the network and that trust remains decentralized.

An even more fundamental feature of QuantumShield-BC is the application of quantum random number generation (QRNG), which helps with the significant level of unpredictability needed in key cryptographic processes; not just that block generation, nonce selection, and brilliant contract execution are entirely random (all of which can be compromised by classical deterministic PRNGs). Blockchain systems are susceptible to replay attacks and nonce manipulations because classical pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) allow for an entropy prediction attack19. QRNG is based on the quantum mechanical principles of superposition and randomness extraction, offering a genuinely unpredictable entropy source: this guarantees that cryptographic randomness is tamper-evident and immune to deterministic weaknesses intrinsic to all classical PRNGs.

In addition to regular blockchain storage, QuantumShield-BC ensures the security of blockchain storage with quantum-resistant hashing techniques, maintaining the characteristics of immutability in the face of quantum attacks. It also means that traditional hashes, like SHA-256, are vulnerable to Grover's algorithm, and using it on hashes doubles the effectiveness of brute-force attacks against traditional cryptographic hashes. To counter this, the framework uses hash-based digital signatures such as SPHINCS + and quantum-resistant hashing algorithms such as Keccak, which are believed to have a high degree of resistance against potential quantum computational speed-ups. This ensures that blockchain ledger data is secure and unalterable by any quantum computer that can currently break conventional hashing functions.

The leader selection mechanism of a consensus mechanism is generally vulnerable to predictability attacks, because attackers can try to control the election result by using the deterministic randomness source in the leader election process on the blockchain. QuantumShield-BC addresses this issue by utilizing QRNG for leader selection, resulting in an entirely random and immutable selection of validators. While traditional leader election mechanisms are based on deterministic algorithms, the use of quantum-generated randomness prevents the adversarial influence of private information, ensuring safety and transparency in blockchain governance.

In addition, the framework also provides a hybrid cryptographic scheme that merges QKD and post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (PQC-KEM), including Kyber and FrodoKEM17,51. Our hybrid encryption scheme preserves the security of the secondary post-quantum encryption layer even under a compromise of QKD due to implementation-layer issues. Through dual-layer encryption, QuantumShield-BC is more resistant than previous solutions against classical and quantum cyber threats, offering strong security assurances for blockchain transactions and innovative contract executions.

One of the additional characteristics of QuantumShield-BC is that it is resilient to quantum-enhanced replay attacks. For instance, classical blockchains use nonce verification to ensure no transaction occurs twice (essentially timestamp-based checks for duplicates), but using the quantum computer to essentially time travel and trigger a validation bypass by the device's incorrect timestamps. By integrating QRNG, it is guaranteed that a truly quantum-generated atom is used to generate the next transaction nonce, making any potential replay of an old transaction impossible. These security measures make blockchain transactions highly secure and enable strong protection against double-spending and duplication attacks, which cannot even be carried forward in a quantum computing environment.

QuantumShield-BC is a new kind of quantum-secure blockchain architecture that synergistically integrates these innovations to help make decentralized systems quantum-resistant for years to come. This means that integrating post-quantum cryptography, quantum key distribution, QRNG, and Q-BFT consensus helps to protect against quantum attacks on each part of the blockchain. QuantumShield-BC not only defines a benchmark for secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof blockchain ecosystems but also runs on an out-of-the-box quantum-resilience framework, as opposed to the traditional blockchain systems that will need first-order cryptographic upgrades to maintain their post-quantum securability.

To summarize, the key innovation of QuantumShield-BC include integration in single protocol level of post-quantum digital signature, quantum-key-distribution and quantum-random-number generator coupled with a new Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus algorithm. Although prior work tends to analyse such technologies in a loose setting or a restricted manner together, QuantumShield-BC enables a complete modular and end-to-end architecture with scalability and quantum resistance empirical performance validation. The unification of cryptographic, communication and consensus resilience into a single deployable blockchain framework is the central contribution of our work.

QuantumShield-BC is analysed in our security benchmarking against post-quantum cryptographic attacks, especially attacks that target classical blockchain cryptographic schemes, enabled through quantum computations. The evaluation tests the framework on Shor's Algorithm (which can break RSA and ECC keys) and Grover's Algorithm (to speed up brute-force search for hash function) and the quantum-based Sybil attack, replay attack, and MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attack. That is how QuantumShield-BC will keep blockchain transactions resistant against emerging quantum attacks, while ensuring the transactions' integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity.

One of the main ingredients of the security benchmark is resistance to Shor's Algorithm. This well-known quantum computing algorithm can factor large numbers and solve discrete logarithm problems in polynomial time. Shor's algorithm for breaking an RSA key has a computational complexity given by

where cap N is the RSA key size in bits. The security of classical blockchain systems is based on RSA and ECC, which these systems use for digital signatures. Still, these algorithms' security is compromised by quantum advances27. To reduce this effect, QuantumShield-BC substitutes RSA and ECC aspects with post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes like CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+, capable of evading Shor's polynomial-time factorization.

Grover's Algorithm is the second crucial quantum attack vector, which brings a square-root speedup for brute-force cryptographic hash function attacks. For a classical brute-force search, the attack complexity is

Where \(\:n\:is\:the\:length\:in\:bits\:of\:the\:cryptographic\) hash. But, Algorithm reduces this to for

which reduces the security level of classical hash functions by 2. To resist this well-known limitation of these hash functions against Grover's search speed-up, QuantumShield-BC takes advantage of quantum-resistant hash functions, namely the SPHINCS + hash function for the authorisation private keys and the Keccak function in the authorisation process and the authentication private keys. Doubling the hash bit-length (e.g., SHA3-512 instead of SHA3-256) restores the same security level against quantum brute-force attacks as the original blockchain.

Another critical security metric is the resistance against Sybil attacks, especially quantum-based ones. In classical blockchain systems, an adversary controlling many validator nodes can compromise the nodes, which is particularly damaging to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. The Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus protocol in QuantumShield-BC ensures that quantum-authenticated validators can only perform block validation. This is the validator authentication function provided by

Where \(\:{V}_{node}\) is a validator's authentication status, \(\:{S}_{v}\) is the validator's post-quantum digital signature, and cap H of cap B is the cryptographic hash of a proposed block. This shows why identity verification based on quantum-secure multi-party computation (QMPC) is essential. An attacker could still build a quantum computer today, so forging validator identities is impossible.

One critical security risk for the blockchain is replay attacks, where an opponent can take a copy of an earlier transaction and re-inject it into the chain to influence the ledger. Timestamp-based protection used in classic blockchains may be subject to quantum tampering. However, in QuantumShield-BC, Random Number Generation (RNG) is coupled with Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) to avoid nonce duplication and thus prevent replay attacks. Nonce generation utilizes the following QRNG entropy function:

Where \(\:{R}_{Q}\) is tthe quantum entropy value, cap Q cap B is the generated bit sequence, p sub i s the probability distribution of each quantum state. Replay attacks are impossible in QRNG because of true randomness.

It also evaluates against the quantum man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, in which an adversary attempts to intercept cryptographic key exchanges between blockchain nodes. Quantum decryption can break traditional key exchange protocols such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman and expose attackers to private keys. Unlike classical key exchange, which can be intercepted, QuantumShield-BC deploys Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to establish keys with guaranteed security. Thus, the function of the key agreement based on QKD is expressed as:

\(\:K\) is the secret key produced,\(\:\:{Q}_{S}\) is the quantum state transmitted by the sender and \(\:{Q}_{R}\) is the quantum state received. As interception changes the quantum state, any eavesdropping is immediately apparent.

Finally, QuantumShield-BC analyzes its security in relation to quantum-assisted double-spending attacks, in which an adversary attempts to spend the same digital signature in two transactions. Quantum computers can potentially compromise the digital signatures on which classical blockchains rely. QuantumShield-BC addresses this issue, as post-quantum signature verification is required in multiple layers, necessitating several independent verifications of each transaction before confirmation. For the multi-party transaction verification function, we have

Where \(\:{M}_{C}\) denotes the consensus verification state, \(\:{S}_{i}\) is the quantum-resistant digital signature from validator \(\:i\), a \(\:\:H\left({T}_{i}\right)\) is the cryptographic hash of transaction \(\:{T}_{i}\). In this way, transaction double-spending is avoided in the face of quantum adversaries, even in safe states of the blockchain (i.e., blocks that are sufficiently deep in the chain of the Blockchain).

QuantumShield-BC exhibits higher resiliency than classical blockchain architectures against favored quantum threats, including the Shor algorithm, the Grover algorithm, Sybil attacks, replay attacks, MITM attacks, and double-spending attempts. In conclusion, the framework offers a resilient solution for the post-quantum world by integrating long-lived security (QKD), post-quantum one-way public key cryptography, QRNG, and decent ralized quantum multiparty computation (QMPC), which combines non-repudiation, tamper-resistance, and trust.

QuantumShield-BC is demonstrated to be secure in a quantum-capable adversarial model, which is exceedingly strong and provides a robust security analysis. To this end, we consider a setting in which adversaries have access to scalable quantum computing power, which they can utilize to run algorithms such as Shor's algorithm for integer factorization and discrete logarithms, as well as Grover's algorithm for a quadratic speedup of brute-force search. These capabilities threaten classical blockchain cryptographic primitives in a realistic sense, namely, RSA, ECDSA, and SHA-256.

To fight against these attacks, QuantumShield-BC uses post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are security-based on hard lattice problems (specifically Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) and Module Short Integer Solution (Module-SIS) problems). Our system utilizes CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and Kyber algorithms, which have been confirmed to be among the finalists or recommended algorithms in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process, with mathematical assumptions that quantum adversaries cannot effectively counter. These schemes are robust against any quantum decryption attempts, as their running time remains exponential, while such algorithms can only run in polynomial time.

Additionally, a quantum key distribution (QKD) method based on the BB84 and E91 protocols is integrated into QuantumShield-BC. Such protocols are based on genuine quantum features (more specifically, the no-cloning theorem and measurement disturbance), which guarantee a very high probability of eavesdrop detection on the quantum channel. This results in information-theoretic security on the exchange of secrets in the key exchange phase, which is not possible classically.

Our framework comprises a QRNG (quantum random number generation) system, which guarantees unpredictable leader selection and nonce generation, thereby solving the most common entropy-based attacks on classical pseudo-random number generators. QRNG is not merely based on quantum state collapse or even quantum state preparations over true entropy sources; the 1 s and 0 s output by QRNG are fundamentally resistant to reverse engineering or even state prediction under quantum analysis.

When taken together, these elements form a quantum-resilient security architecture. QuantumShield-BC provides such strong quantum resilience across all layers of blockchain operation by explicitly modelling the capabilities of quantum adversaries and then designing each cryptographic and consensus component to withstand those capabilities.

Experimental results of the QuantumShield-BC framework prove the system's performance, security, and scalability with quantum-aware parameters. Through a combination of comparative analysis, benchmarking against quantum attacks, and ablation studies, we empirically demonstrate that post-quantum cryptography (PQC), quantum key distribution (QKD), and quantum random number generation (QRNG) each improve operational efficacy across a wide variety of metrics and contexts.

The experimental evaluation of the QuantumShield-BC framework was conducted on a prototype developed in Python, which aggregates quantum-safe cryptographic libraries using PyCryptodome and Open Quantum Safe (OQS) toolkit bindings. In the simulation environment, 25 validator nodes, each operated by a Docker container within a local distributed environment, were utilized. Each container adopted a blockchain node style, featuring independent signing, verification, and consensus modules, connected via a virtual network with QKD emulation channels. The post-quantum digital signatures implemented in the prototype are based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium (only level 2), Falcon (512-bit), and SPHINCS + signatures to benefit from NIST standardization and implementation support.

For QKD simulation, the BB84 protocol was emulated using pseudo-quantum key exchange logic to enable key reconciliation and eavesdropping detection within the prototype. QRNG values were generated using a high-entropy quantum bitstream sourced from an open-access QRNG API, with a fallback to simulated quantum entropy included to ensure comprehensive test coverage across multiple configurations. Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) was implemented by extending a classical BFT model with validator authentication through post-quantum signatures and QRNG-driven leader selection logic.

To ensure replicability, hyperparameters were explicitly configured and kept consistent throughout all experiments. The number of validators was fixed at 25, and the consensus threshold was set to 17. The quantum key length was initialized to 256 bits and refreshed every 10 consensus rounds. Signature key pairs were pre-generated and distributed securely among nodes at initialization. Leader selection invoked QRNG calls per round using a modular mapping of entropy values to active validator indices.

We experimented with the prototype, which was run on an Ubuntu 22.04 system with a 16-core CPU, 64GB RAM, and Python 3.10. Modular scripts are included in a codebase for key generation, QKD simulation, transaction processing, and consensus execution. Finally, all dependencies and version information have been specified in the requirements file, allowing for quick reproduction. For each experiment run, logs were recorded, and by randomizing QRNG streams over several seeds, the same benchmarks could be repeated across different setups. This system is fully containerized for deployment onto a Linux-based distributed environment, held to allow for validation by other researchers.

Experimental parameters, such as the validator number (n = 100), quantum entropy sampling rate, and PQC scheme settings (e.g., Falcon-512, Dilithium-3), were chosen according to recently recommended benchmarks by NIST, as well as compatibility with open-source post-quantum cryptographic libraries (e.g., liboqs, PQClean). This is a compromise between the potential to work in the real world and a setting where adversaries can be simulated. The validator set sizes in Table 1 are chosen to represent a plausible consortium blockchain for critical infrastructure configuration. Similarly, the signature schemes are interchangeable, as per the performance-security trade-offs discussed in Sect. 3.7.

The comparison assesses the performance of QuantumShield-BC about a classical blockchain model based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) signatures and a common Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol. To maximize the fairness of the comparison, both systems were implemented using the same infrastructure/node count/transaction load. The aim was to demonstrate the effects of a quantum-resilient mechanism pool on transaction authentication, consensus formation, and overall system security.

In the classical setup, transactions were signed with 256-bit ECDSA keys and verified through PoW mining. On the other hand, QuantumShield-BC implemented lattice-based post-quantum digital signatures (CRYSTALS-Dilithium), random number generation from a QRNG (the nonces), and Q-BFT as the consensus mechanism. The following metrics were measured (over multiple runs): key generation, signature verification, block finalization time, and communication overhead.

As shown in Table 2, QuantumShield-BC takes marginally higher initial key and signature generation time since post-quantum algorithms have larger key sizes. Nevertheless, we made it significantly more efficient in terms of consensus compared to the classical model, as it eliminated computational delays associated with PoW through QRNG-based leader selection and lightweight validator authentication. In addition, the use of QKD allowed for secure key exchanges between the nodes, which was not possible in a classical system.

Significantly, under simulated quantum attacks (i.e., key extraction using Shor's algorithm simulation), the classical approach was compromised, whereas QuantumShield-BC remained intact in all possible attack settings (Q1-Q3). Such evaluation clearly shows that QuantumShield-BC imposes some small amount of cryptographic overhead on block creation time. However, it achieves much better quantum resistance, faster consensus under a controllable validator set, and sustainable performance that suits the post-quantum blockchain environment.

Here, we evaluate the security of QuantumShield-BC against simulated quantum attacks, including those using Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, Sybil attacks, replay attacks, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. We then compare the performance and security properties of QuantumShield-BC with those of a classical blockchain system using ECDSA and Proof-of-Work.

In the classical portions of the system, a post-processed brute-force attack was conducted to simulate Shor's attack on 256-bit ECDSA keys, utilizing pre-quantum factorization emulation to simulate the key extraction attempts. This system only lasted seconds before being compromised (thanks to Cnet for the video). However, QuantumShield-BC, using the post-quantum signatures CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon, was unscathed, since Shor's polynomial-time factorization is not practical against these schemes. In this manner, Grover's attack was copied using a faster brute-force search on classical outputs of the hash based on SHA-256. The classical blockchain exhibited a 50% reduction in security, implying that the hash collision resistance of the classical blockchain was compromised. With SPHINCS + and Keccak-based hashing, QuantumShield-BC maintained complete entropy resistance, but Grover's effect, equivalent to 30 Qubits, has a low influence on practical execution time.

Under a Sybil attack simulation, multiple fake validators were injected into the network. The absence of strong identity authentication in the classical system allowed these nodes to influence block validation. QuantumShield-BC mitigated this threat through mandatory validator authentication using post-quantum public keys, effectively rejecting non-verified nodes. For replay attack evaluation, previously signed transactions were resent with slight modifications to their timestamps. The classical blockchain accepted several of these due to nonce reuse or time-based gaps. QuantumShield-BC, which leverages QRNG-generated unique nonces per transaction, successfully detected and rejected all duplicates, thereby maintaining transaction integrity.

MITM attacks were simulated during key exchange phases. Public keys were intercepted and replaced in the classical setup, compromising encryption. QuantumShield-BC used QKD to establish symmetric session keys over quantum channels, which collapsed upon interception attempts, instantly flagging the communication as tampered. QuantumShield-BC exhibited robust security across all attack simulations, with no successful breach observed, while the classical model demonstrated significant vulnerabilities in all quantum-threat scenarios. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed quantum-resilient components in ensuring the long-term security of blockchain infrastructure.

Table 3 presents the results of simulated quantum and adversarial attack scenarios on classical blockchain and QuantumShield-BC. Metrics such as key recovery time, hash strength, and attack success rates reveal that classical systems are highly vulnerable to Shor's, Grover's, and Sybil attacks. In contrast, QuantumShield-BC consistently resists all threats, demonstrating its robustness against post-quantum security challenges.

To evaluate QuantumShield-BC's scalability and resource efficiency, experiments were conducted by progressively increasing the number of validators from 10 to 100 and simulating transaction loads ranging from 100 to 10,000 transactions per round. The impact on consensus latency, QKD overhead, and bandwidth usage was recorded across multiple runs.

As the validator count increased, the Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) protocol maintained stable consensus formation times up to 50 validators, beyond which latency gradually increased due to cryptographic signature verification and message propagation. However, since Q-BFT does not involve mining or heavy computation, the growth in consensus delay remained sub-linear compared to Proof-of-Work-based systems.

The QKD overhead was measured regarding key refresh cycles and communication payload. Each QKD session involved an initial quantum key exchange followed by classical reconciliation. When tested with 25 active validator pairs, the average key generation and reconciliation time per session was within acceptable latency margins. To reduce overhead, keys were reused across multiple secure rounds via hybrid encryption schemes.

Bandwidth consumption primarily stemmed from signature broadcasting and validator authentication messages. In QuantumShield-BC, using lattice-based signatures results in larger message sizes (e.g., Dilithium signatures are ~ 2.5–4 KB), which increases the per-block transmission size by 20–30% compared to classical signatures. Nonetheless, the system effectively handled higher throughput by compressing public communication and limiting redundant key exchanges through session-based QKD caching.

Transaction throughput remained stable as the system scaled, with the QRNG-based leader selection maintaining randomness quality and fairness even in large validator networks. The system's design ensured that adding new nodes did not linearly increase the consensus cost, thanks to parallel verification and modular consensus thresholding. Overall, QuantumShield-BC demonstrated efficient scalability with moderate resource usage. While it incurs additional cryptographic and QKD overhead compared to classical models, its optimized consensus and key management mechanisms enable practical deployment in moderately large distributed blockchain networks.

QuantumShield-BC Scalability: Table 4 displays QuantumShield-BC scalability behavior with increased validators and transactions. With some limited overhead for QKD and bandwidth requirements, the framework still achieves low consensus latency and high throughput. It shows that it is efficient and feasible for various applications within a distributed architecture under quantum safety needs and medium to large-sized validator networks.

Scalability and resource efficiency metrics of QuantumShield-BC across increasing validator counts and transaction loads, highlighting trends in latency, QKD overhead, bandwidth usage, and system throughput.

As shown in Fig. 5, the QuantumShield-BC framework scales well and consumes fewer resources while scaling the validator counts and bi-directional transaction volumes. In subfigure (a), we observe a linear increase in the number of transactions per round from 10 to 100 validators, showcasing one of the system's throughput limits. Figure (b): Consensus latency as a function of the number of validators grows slowly as we increase the validator size. One more signature must be cryptographically verified for each additional validator, but remains less than an order of magnitude arising from PoW-based delays. In subfigure (c), QKD overhead continues to grow gradually, exhibiting the expected extra key exchanges, but remaining tolerable as optimal key reuse strategies mitigate it. Subfigure (d) Bandwidth consumption (per block) is also growing primarily due to post-quantum signature size, but it is still scalable23. As an indicator that QuantumShield-BC can efficiently accept larger loads without degrading the performance, the TPS (transactions per second) continues increasing in subfigure (e). The results confirm the framework's ability for secure and reliable scaling within distributed quantum-secure blockchain domains.

We performed an ablation study to evaluate the individual contributions of core components in QuantumShield-BC. We either disabled each component or replaced it with its classical counterpart. The objective was to test the individual contributions of QRNG, QKD, and PQC to the overall security, performance, and workings of the system.

For leader selection in the first experiment, the Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) was replaced with a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). We confirmed this allowed intentional bias, repeatable patterns in leader elections between rounds, and a higher degree of targeted consensus attack risk. Additionally, according to entropy tests, the quality of randomness was reduced by 30–40%, reducing the resistance to probabilistic prediction attacks.

In our second experiment, we disabled our QKD protocol and reverted to classical elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) for key exchange. Performance did get marginally better since it reduced the amount of communication between the nodes, but it also guaranteed that the system was now open to simulated man-in-the-middle attacks. Attackers could decrypt messages sent by validators as they intercepted public keys, reinforcing the need for QKD to secure validator message delivery from adversaries with the ability to thwart quantum cryptography.

In the third configuration, post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (PQC) such as Dilithium were replaced with classical ECDSA for transaction signing and validator authentication. Under simulated Shor's algorithm conditions, ECDSA keys were compromised within seconds, allowing unauthorized transaction approval and Sybil node injection. In contrast, the original PQC configuration showed no such vulnerability, affirming its necessity in a post-quantum threat model.

When all quantum components were turned off simultaneously, the system exhibited high throughput but suffered severe security degradation. Transaction tampering, identity spoofing, and leader bias became feasible in multiple test rounds. Conversely, when quantum components were active, all such vulnerabilities were mitigated, with only minor trade-offs in performance. This study confirms that each quantum component in QuantumShield-BC plays a vital, non-redundant role. PQC ensures cryptographic strength, QKD safeguards communication, and QRNG guarantees unbiased consensus. Their integration provides a secure, future-ready blockchain infrastructure that classical counterparts cannot match under quantum threat conditions.

Table 5 summarizes the ablation study of QuantumShield-BC, analyzing the effect of disabling key quantum components. Removing QRNG, QKD, or PQC significantly compromises system security, fairness, and unpredictability. While minor performance gains are observed, the entire quantum configuration offers optimal protection against all simulated quantum and classical attacks.

Ablation study results showing the impact of disabling QRNG, QKD, and PQC on entropy, security, fairness, communication integrity, and transaction throughput in QuantumShield-BC.

Figure 6 illustrates the results of the ablation study conducted on the QuantumShield-BC framework, analyzing the impact of disabling or replacing key quantum components—QRNG, QKD, and PQC—on system performance and security. Subfigure (a) shows a notable drop in entropy when QRNG is replaced with a PRNG, highlighting reduced randomness in leader selection. Subfigure (b) demonstrates the decline in attack resistance, with classical configurations failing under simulated Shor's and MITM attacks. In (c), consensus fairness drops significantly when QRNG is disabled, indicating increased susceptibility to biased validator selection. Subfigure (d) presents the effect on communication security, showing vulnerability in key exchange when QKD is removed. Lastly, (e) shows a modest TPS gain when quantum components are removed, but at the cost of substantial security degradation. Together, these results validate that each quantum component makes a critical contribution to the robustness and trustworthiness of the QuantumShield-BC system.

Additionally, advances in quantum computing pose a significant risk to the cryptographic mechanisms that currently secure most blockchain technologies used today. Well-known classical cryptography methods have been identified in the literature as vulnerable to attack by quantum algorithms, with Shor's and Grover's algorithms capable of breaking key encryption and hash functions in polynomial time, given the number of configurations (Ishai et al.). This has led to a dire necessity for reshaping blockchain frameworks that can effectively withstand post-quantum attacks. However, approaches in the current state of the art tend to suffer from at least one of the following deficiencies: they are computationally expensive, scale badly, couple quantum and classical solutions poorly, or they lack consensus frameworks that encompass the entire threat space.

This paper presents QuantumShield-BC, a comprehensive framework for a quantum-secured blockchain designed to address these urgent gaps. It combines lattice-based post-quantum digital signatures with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure channel communication and a Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus protocol for selecting a leader on top of QKD, utilizing Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) for unbiased leader selection. These modules can be easily plugged in, achieving quantum resistance, enabling fair consensus, and protecting against common forms of attack, such as Sybil, replay, and MITM attacks.

We validate the security of QuantumShield-BC under quantum attack simulations, demonstrating that it achieves this while maintaining reasonable performance and scalability, outperforming classical blockchain systems. An ablation study indicates that every quantum component strengthens the entire architecture independently. While existing work either provides a point solution (e.g., PQC-only or QKD-only) with key weaknesses or abstracts insights from higher levels, it is the first end-to-end design that balances providing both robustness and compatibility with realistic workloads.

QuantumShield-BC establishes a unified architecture that overcomes the limitations of most previous work, providing a solid foundation for developing distributed systems that will remain secure against quantum attacks in the future. This has significant implications for secure digital identity, financial transactions, and the resilience of critical infrastructure. These limitations and directions for future enhancement are discussed in Sect. 6.1.

Although QuantumShield-BC achieves robust post-quantum security, the present work has some limitations. The first reason is that the imno QKD implementation was simulated, rather than deployed with real quantum hardware, which may not capture all operational complexities. However, as a result, the system cannot be generalized to non-public networks, as it was tested on a controlled testbed of a maximum of 100 validators. Third, post-quantum algorithms, such as Dilithium and SPHINCS+, utilize larger keys and signatures with higher computational complexity, which can impact performance, especially in resource-constrained environments. All of these would require further investigation in a real-world setting to ensure scalability, efficiency, and the possibility of integrating with legacy blockchain and quantum infrastructure ecosystems.

Quantum computing will inevitably threaten security landscapes by breaking well-established cryptographic primitives, including the public keys used for blockchain security1,21. The framework, which is designed, simulated, and evaluated systematically, achieves enhanced transaction authenticity, consensus fairness, and quantum-resistant security, compared to classical blockchain designs. It also demonstrates, through an ablation study, that each quantum component is critical in preserving the integrity of the entire system. The study identifies, however, certain limitations, including the simulation of QKD, heterogeneous validator testing, and the computational overheads of PQC schemes. When quantum hardware matures, we will implement real-world QKD channels, optimizing the PQC algorithms for low-resource usage and scaling the system to thousands of validators. In addition, exploring the multi-chain potential of QuantumShield-BC and the benefits of brilliant contract execution in a post-quantum world would also be interesting avenues to pursue. Finally, QuantumShield-BC provides a building block for quantum-safe distributed systems. Its myriad cryptographic, communication, and consensus-level protections make it a stepping stone toward quantum-proof blockchain applications in finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure. Its scalability, hardware adaptability, and operational readiness will be enhanced through further research, enabling deployment in blockchain environments.

The fintech industry is among the fastest-growing industries globally, with the UK at its lead. With digital payments, mobile banking, and peer-to-peer lending becoming the new norms, the significance of security within financial applications has increased exponentially. Conventional security systems are found to be inadequate against developing cyber attacks, and enterprise blockchain solutions, therefore, come as a natural solution for secure fintech applications.

 

Blockchain's transparent, decentralized, and tamper-proof architecture allows financial institutions to secure customer information, minimize fraud, and maintain compliance. Blockchain is no longer merely a trend but is actually shaping fintech's future.

Increasing Security Threats in Fintech

The financial sector is heavily regulated, yet even the most rigorous protocols tend to fall short against current cyberattacks. Identity theft, system breaches, and fraudulent transactions are become greater threats. Clients want real-time services but uncompromised security as well.

 

The rope between innovation and security is getting increasingly difficult to walk. That is why fintech companies are looking into blockchain: a system wherein security and efficiency walk hand in hand.

The UK Fintech Advantage 

The UK is still among the leaders of the world when it comes to adopting fintech. Its regulatory environments promote innovation coupled with tight compliance regulations. Yet again, the same compliance regulations make it challenging for businesses that want to scale quickly without subjecting themselves to vulnerabilities.

 

This is where blockchain comes in as a competitive advantage, especially for those working with a fintech app development company in UK. Blockchain technology not only secures apps but also ensures adherence to regulatory requirements.

1. Enhanced Transaction Security

Blockchain provides immutable records. Once data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered, minimizing fraud risks and ensuring trust in every transaction.

 

2. Privacy with Transparency 

Fintech apps are able to provide customers with visibility into their transactions yet shield sensitive personal information. This equilibrium provides greater user confidence without ever compromising compliance.

 

3. More Efficient Settlement Processes 

Blockchain minimizes intermediaries in payment and settlement processes. What previously took days now takes near-real-time.

 

4. Cost Savings 

By eliminating redundant third parties and automating trust, financial institutions achieve considerable cost savings on operations.

 

5. Compliance with Regulations 

Blockchain facilitates traceability. Each transaction leaves a clear, auditable record, making it easier to comply with GDPR, AML, and KYC requirements.

Cross-Border Payments 

International transfers are time-consuming and costly. Blockchain accelerates them, makes them less costly, and more open.

 

Smart Contracts in Lending 

Loans can be automated using smart contracts that trigger once criteria have been satisfied. Delays are eliminated and disputes minimized.

 

Identity Management 

Blockchain digital identity solutions secure individuals from identity theft while entrusting them with their personal information.

 

Fraud Detection 

With tamper-proof records, blockchain aids banks and fintech organizations in identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time.

Banking Institutions 

Large banks are adopting blockchain for secure settlement, instant remittance, and customer identity authentication.

 

Insurance Providers 

Smart contracts eliminate claims fraud and facilitate quicker settlement cycles, revolutionizing customer experience.

 

Peer-to-Peer Platforms 

Blockchain establishes trust among users without requiring central intermediaries. It is beneficial for lending and crowdfunding platforms.

Implementing blockchain is not merely a technical move; it's a strategy. Businesses require a development partner familiar with compliance, security, and scalability. When selecting possible partners, companies ought to consider:

 

Working with a partner ensures not just secure application delivery but also long-term adaptability to future challenges.

One trusted name in this domain is Appinventiv, a global leader delivering blockchain-driven fintech solutions. Their expertise spans mobile banking apps, digital wallets, identity solutions, and secure payment platforms.

 

Appinventiv is recognized for pairing fintech depth with fast-paced enterprise blockchain implementation. The firm has aligned itself with major financial institutions to provide high-performance solutions that meet stringent compliance standards. By emphasizing business results along with technical delivery, Appinventiv assists enterprises in building confidence in safely growing blockchain.

The fintech environment will shape up even more in the years to come. Blockchain will drive such innovations as:

 

As regulatory pressure increases and customer expectations grow, fintech companies that jump in early on blockchain will gain a major competitive edge.

The fintech sector is facing increasing pressure to produce quick, secure, and compliant solutions. Enterprise blockchain solutions are not optional - they are becoming the foundation of trusted financial services.

 

For UK and global businesses alike, the process begins with developing an understanding of blockchain potential, weighing its advantages, and aligning with experts who can bring tangible results. With established leaders such as Appinventiv spearheading fintech adoption of blockchain, businesses can tap into security, efficiency, and trust at scale.

Last month I went to an organic winery in Signagi, Republic of Georgia.  It was a three hour trip from my base in at Tblissi, through a desert and a range of multi colored mountains, which stood out in unlikely brownish-purple and brownish-red hues against the sweltering summer sky.  The wine maker's dog, dusty but calm and affectionate, slept on top of my foot as the wine maker talked about his process, explaining that Georgian wines are fermented under the ground in earthen pots, without the use of yeast.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- Pi Network invests $20M in OpenMind AGI to bridge blockchain and artificial general intelligence (AGI), targeting decentralized AI infrastructure.

- The Philippine Hackathon 2025 incentivizes developers with $48,000 in Pi tokens to build AI-blockchain applications in healthcare and logistics.

- Institutional backing from Coinbase Ventures and Sequoia China validates the integration, despite a 16% token price drop and 32% trading volume surge.

- Long-term success hinges on regulatory clarity, mainnet development, and real-world use cases from the hackathon to establish Pi as a utility asset.

- The move positions Pi as a high-risk/high-reward play in AI-blockchain convergence, with potential governance value if ecosystems scale effectively.

In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain and artificial intelligence, Pi Network's $20 million investment in OpenMind AGI represents a pivotal moment. This move transcends traditional cryptocurrency narratives, positioning Pi as a bridge between decentralized finance (DeFi) and the nascent field of artificial general intelligence (AGI). For investors, the question is no longer whether AI and blockchain can coexist—it's how their integration will redefine value creation in the digital age.  

Pi Network's journey began with a mobile-first approach to mining, democratizing access to blockchain for smartphone users. However, the recent partnership with OpenMind AGI signals a strategic pivot toward real-world utility. OpenMind's OM1 operating system—a decentralized AI platform for robots—aligns with Pi's vision of expanding blockchain beyond payments. By embedding blockchain as a trust layer for machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions, Pi is addressing a critical gap in AGI development: secure, scalable coordination.  

The FABRIC protocol, OpenMind's decentralized identity and coordination layer, mirrors the role of Ethereum in Web3 but for robotics. This synergy is not merely technical; it's economic. Blockchain enables microtransactions between autonomous systems, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where AI-driven robots can trade services, data, or compute power. For Pi, this means transitioning from a speculative token to a utility asset underpinning a decentralized AI infrastructure.  

Pi's simultaneous launch of the Philippine Hackathon 2025 underscores its commitment to developer-driven innovation. By offering 160,000 Pi tokens (valued at $48,000) to incentivize applications leveraging AI and blockchain, Pi is fostering a community of builders. The hackathon's focus on sectors like healthcare and logistics highlights the potential for tangible use cases—such as AI-powered diagnostic tools or autonomous supply chain management.  

The success of this initiative hinges on the quality of applications produced. If developers create scalable solutions, Pi's token could gain intrinsic value as a medium of exchange within these ecosystems. Tools like Pi App Studio and the Developer Portal further lower barriers to entry, democratizing access to AI-blockchain integration.  

 

The immediate 16% drop in Pi's token price post-announcement reflects market skepticism, a common reaction to high-risk, high-reward bets. However, increased trading volume (up 32% to $46.65 million) suggests growing interest. Institutional backing from Coinbase Ventures, Sequoia China, and Pantera Capital adds credibility, signaling that OpenMind's vision aligns with broader industry trends.  

For context, Ethereum's recent $2.3 billion ETF inflows and Cardano's whale accumulation indicate a sector-wide shift toward AI-integrated blockchain projects. Pi's strategic pivot mirrors this trend, leveraging institutional capital to de-risk its AGI ambitions.  

Investors must weigh Pi's long-term potential against several variables:1. Regulatory Clarity: AI and blockchain face evolving regulatory scrutiny. A favorable policy environment could accelerate adoption.2. Mainnet Development: Pi's transition to a fully functional mainnet remains critical. Delays could undermine confidence.3. Ecosystem Viability: The Philippine Hackathon's output will determine whether Pi's tools translate into real-world value.  

If successful, Pi's token could evolve into a governance or utility asset within a decentralized AI economy. The integration of tools like the Pi Browser and Passkey login further enhances user stickiness, creating a flywheel effect.  

Pi Network's bet on OpenMind AGI is a speculative but strategically sound move. While short-term volatility is inevitable, the long-term upside lies in its ability to capture a share of the AI-blockchain convergence. For risk-tolerant investors, this represents an opportunity to participate in a foundational shift in decentralized infrastructure.  

Recommendation: Investors should monitor the Philippine Hackathon's mid-checkpoint (September 19, 2025) for early signals of developer traction. Additionally, tracking Ethereum's ETF inflows () could provide context for broader market sentiment.  

In conclusion, Pi's $20 million investment is not just a financial commitment—it's a declaration of intent to redefine the boundaries of blockchain and AI. For those willing to navigate the uncertainties, the rewards could be transformative.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- NFT and DeFi platforms face liquidity traps and fragility, exemplified by Parallel Finance's collapse, which locked $800K in high-value NFTs and exposed governance flaws.

- NFT lending volumes dropped 97% since 2024, with loan sizes down 71% by 2025, showing declining confidence and use cases amid systemic risks.

- Experts urge self-custody (e.g., MetaMask) and insurance protocols (Nexus Mutual) to mitigate platform risks and custodial vulnerabilities in a fragmented market.

- Regulatory shifts, like the UK's 2025 Digital Assets Bill, aim to address NFT custody and liquidity challenges amid market uncertainty and low adoption rates.

- Investors must prioritize governance transparency, self-custody, and insurance to navigate NFT market fragility and ensure asset security in evolving ecosystems.

The NFT market, once a beacon of innovation in digital ownership, has entered a period of reckoning. From 2023 to 2025, the sector has grappled with liquidity traps and platform fragility, epitomized by the collapse of Parallel Finance—a case study in systemic risk. Over $800,000 worth of high-value NFTs, including 11 Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) tokens and 39 Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) tokens, were locked in smart contracts after the platform abruptly discontinued its NFT lending product. Users faced a $500 fee to retrieve their assets, a move that exposed governance flaws and custodial vulnerabilities. This incident is not an outlier but a symptom of a broader crisis in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT asset management.  

The NFT lending market has seen a 97% decline in trading volumes since its 2024 peak, with borrower activity dropping 90% and lender participation falling 78%. The average loan size has plummeted from $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in 2025—a 71% decline. These figures reflect a market in retreat, driven by eroding confidence and a lack of innovative use cases. Shorter loan durations (31 days in 2025 vs. 40 days in 2023) further underscore a shift toward tactical liquidity management.  

The root of the problem lies in the illiquidity of NFTs themselves. Unlike fungible tokens, NFTs often require custodial infrastructure for ownership transfers, making them susceptible to platform-specific failures. When platforms like Parallel Finance collapse, users are left with no clear path to recover assets, creating a paradox: decentralization's promise is undermined by centralized points of failure.  

Parallel Finance's collapse highlights a critical governance flaw: the absence of contingency plans for platform shutdowns. The $500 withdrawal fee, introduced unilaterally, created a capital trap for users. While a technical workaround via Etherscan eventually resolved the issue, it required expertise many users lacked. This incident underscores the need for governance transparency—open-source code, community-driven decision-making, and clear exit strategies.  

Platforms that prioritize scalability over user accessibility are increasingly at risk of reputational and operational collapse. For instance, the “flip-for-liquidity” model, effective in bull markets, has proven inadequate in a risk-averse environment. Investors must now scrutinize protocols for governance accountability and contingency planning.  

To mitigate liquidity risks, experts advocate self-custody solutions. Non-custodial wallets like MetaMask and Gnosis Safe allow users to store NFTs directly on-chain, eliminating reliance on third-party platforms. While this approach requires secure private key management, it removes the risk of platform failure.  

Insurance protocols such as Nexus Mutual and Etherisc are also gaining traction. These tools provide coverage against smart contract failures and custodial risks, offering a safety net for NFT holders. However, adoption remains limited, with many investors still entrusting assets to centralized platforms.  

 

Regulatory developments are shaping the NFT landscape. The UK's Digital Assets Bill (2025) legally recognizes NFTs as property, addressing custody and liquidity challenges. In the U.S., the SEC's evolving stance under Chair Paul Atkins may ease regulatory pressure, fostering innovation in custody solutions. However, the sector remains in a legal gray area, with utility NFTs and securities classifications creating uncertainty.  

Market projections paint a mixed picture. NFT revenue is forecasted to reach $504.3 million in 2025, with the U.S. dominating at $87.5 million. Yet, the average revenue per user ($44.5) and low penetration rates (0.15%) highlight structural weaknesses. Liquidity issues persist as platforms struggle to balance scalability with user accessibility.  

For investors, the lesson is clear: liquidity is not inherent in DeFi—it must be engineered. Key strategies include:1. Adopt self-custody: Store NFTs in non-custodial wallets to avoid platform-specific risks.2. Demand governance transparency: Prioritize protocols with open-source code, community governance, and clear contingency plans.3. Leverage insurance protocols: Mitigate smart contract and custodial risks through emerging insurance solutions.4. Monitor regulatory shifts: Stay informed on evolving standards, particularly in the U.S. and UK.  

The NFT market is transitioning from speculative hype to utility-driven growth. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and AI-generated NFTs may yet reignite demand, but until then, liquidity remains a critical bottleneck. Investors must act proactively, prioritizing governance transparency and self-custody to safeguard assets in an increasingly fragile ecosystem.  

As the sector evolves, the Parallel Finance case serves as a cautionary tale. The future of NFTs hinges on robust infrastructure, clear governance, and user empowerment. Those who adapt now will be best positioned to navigate the next phase of this transformative market.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) introduces a dual-chain deflationary model and NFT-driven utility, distinguishing itself from traditional meme coins through institutional-grade mechanics.

- The project operates across Ethereum and Solana, using cross-chain burns to maintain a fixed 200 billion token supply while enabling low-cost transactions on Solana.

- Free-mint NFTs grant governance rights and reinforce the peg between chains, creating a flywheel effect that links NFT adoption to WEPE demand and scarcity.

- Unlike speculative meme coins, WEPE's structured approach addresses inflation risks through smart contract-enforced parity and community-driven value retention.

- Investors should monitor cross-chain burn rates, NFT adoption, and treasury health to assess the project's long-term viability in the volatile meme coin market.

In the volatile world of meme coins, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) has emerged as a standout project, blending the whimsical allure of internet culture with the precision of institutional-grade tokenomics. While most meme coins rely on speculative hype and social media virality, WEPE's dual-chain deflationary strategy and NFT-driven utility position it as a rare hybrid: a community-driven asset with structural safeguards against devaluation. This article unpacks how WEPE's cross-chain burns and NFT integration create a compelling case for long-term value, setting it apart from traditional meme coins.  

At the heart of WEPE's innovation is its dual-chain mechanism, which operates across Ethereum and Solana. Every transaction on Solana triggers the automatic burning of an equivalent value of Ethereum-based WEPE tokens, maintaining a fixed total supply of 200 billion tokens. This burn-and-mint process ensures that the token's scarcity is preserved regardless of which blockchain is used. For example, a purchase of WEPE on Solana—known for its low fees and high throughput—results in the destruction of Ethereum-based tokens, effectively reducing supply on that chain while expanding utility on Solana.  

This cross-chain dynamic is reinforced by a 1:1 peg between the two chains, activated when both versions of the token reach $0.001. Smart contracts enforce this parity, creating a self-correcting mechanism that prevents arbitrage and maintains equilibrium. The result is a deflationary model that mirrors the scarcity of blue-chip assets like Bitcoin, but with the scalability of Solana.  

 

WEPE's NFT strategy further elevates its value proposition. The project launched a free-mint Ethereum-based NFT collection, granting holders access to exclusive benefits such as the Alpha Chat—a real-time trading insights hub—and participation in community-driven events. These NFTs are not mere collectibles; they serve as keys to governance, voting rights, and future airdrops, embedding holders into the project's ecosystem.  

The NFTs also play a role in the deflationary model. For instance, during Solana's expansion phase, one billion Ethereum-based tokens were burned to reinforce the peg between chains. Future NFT drops are expected to leverage Solana's infrastructure, reducing entry barriers for new users while maintaining the project's dual-chain ethos. This integration of NFTs with tokenomics creates a flywheel effect: as NFT utility grows, so does demand for WEPE, further tightening supply.  

Traditional meme coins often lack structural safeguards, relying on fleeting trends and social media momentum. WEPE's approach introduces institutional-grade mechanics that address these weaknesses. By fixing supply and leveraging cross-chain burns, the project mitigates the inflationary risks that plague many meme tokens. Additionally, the NFT-driven community fosters organic growth, as holders are incentivized to defend and promote the asset.  

For investors, WEPE's dual-chain strategy and NFT utility present a unique opportunity. The project's transparency—publicly accessible smart contracts and on-chain data—adds a layer of trust often absent in the meme coin space. Moreover, the integration of Solana's high-performance blockchain positions WEPE to capitalize on the growing demand for scalable, low-cost transactions.  

However, risks remain. The meme coin market is inherently volatile, and WEPE's success hinges on sustained community engagement. Investors should monitor key metrics such as the rate of cross-chain burns, NFT adoption, and the project's treasury health.  

Wall Street Pepe's dual-chain deflationary strategy redefines what's possible in the meme coin space. By combining scarcity, cross-chain interoperability, and NFT-driven utility, WEPE creates a framework for long-term value that transcends the typical hype cycle. For investors seeking a meme coin with structural integrity and community-driven growth, WEPE offers a compelling case. As the crypto market continues to evolve, projects that marry innovation with institutional-grade mechanics—like WEPE—are poised to outperform their peers.  

Investment Advice: Consider allocating a small portion of your portfolio to WEPE, particularly if you're bullish on Solana's ecosystem and the future of meme coins with utility. Monitor the 1:1 peg's stability and the rate of NFT adoption as key indicators of the project's health.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","DeXRP raised over $5M in a viral presale, over 7500 traders joined ICO on XRP","https://cointelegraph.com/market-releases/dexrp-raised-over-5m-in-a-viral-presale-over-7500-traders-joined-ico-on-xrp","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

During this altcoin season, XRP is experiencing strong price growth and a resurgence of institutional confidence. It hit a new ATH in July after 7 years, which shows institutional investors' interest growth.

At the same time, XRPL has secured its place in the top 10 blockchains by tokenized RWA value, surpassing $157 million. In just the past 30 days, XRPL tokenized assets have grown by 34% over the last month, and the Stablecoins Market Cap has hit 181 million. It can be one of the fastest growth trajectories on the market, and XRPL brought institutional interest from major firms like Amber Group.

DeXRP aims to become one of the most anticipated projects in the XRPL ecosystem. Positioned as the first advanced DEX on XRPL, the DeXRP team is developing a bridge for institutional investors, ordinary traders and DeFi platforms by combining a hybrid model of AMM pools and order book functionality.

With its presale already raising over $5 million from more than 7,500 unique wallets, DeXRP is shaping up to become a cornerstone of XRP-powered DeFi.

DeXRP Presale has started last month, and now only 15% Presale allocated tokens left. The DeXRP team is focused now on strategic partnerships with top performing XRPL DeFi platforms and on-chain ecosystem. They have become an official sponsor of the WOW Summit in Hong Kong and announced about cooperation with WOW Earn and Micro3.

The current $DXP token price is $0.08606, and the DeXRP team has announced that listing price will be $0.35. Users can purchase $DXP tokens via Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, XRP Ledger, Bitcoin, or via USDT on supported networks, as well as through bank card transactions.

To reward early investors, the DeXRP Team plans to implement Liquidity mining multipliers, enhanced yield multipliers, unique access to premium trading pairs, an Airdrop and Voting system for new pairs and platform updates.

The DeXRP team has been developing the protocol to address the limitations of existing DEX platforms by combining institutional-grade performance with Community-driven Governance.

Key features include:

Optimized Liquidity Aggregation - DeXRP integrates both automated market maker (AMM) pools and professional order book systems, creating a hybrid liquidity layer.

Hybrid Trading Options - Unlike most DEX platforms that force users into AMM-only models, DeXRP allows users to choose between instant AMM swaps or an advanced order book interface. This makes the platform intuitive for newcomers while giving professional traders the tools they need for precision trading.

Governance and Community Control - all $DXP holders can participate in governance, fee auctions, and platform decisions.

DeXRP's tokenomics have been carefully designed to promote stability, investor confidence, and long-term growth.

Key tokenomic allocations include:

25% of the Total Supply (500,000,000 $DXP) is allocated to the presale, with a 10% TGE unlock and monthly linear vesting;

15% is reserved for Liquidity provision, and 10% for staking rewards, fueling continuous incentives for $DXP holders and contributors;

12% is reserved for the Innovation Fund to create a stable DeXRP ecosystem growth and implementation of future trading models.

This distribution ensures that DeXRP is not only rewarding early investors but also securing long-term growth by fueling development, partnerships, and user adoption.

The DeXRP Platform launch and Listing is planned for Q4 2025 and DeXRP can become the gateway for institutional investors looking join XRPL's high-performance blockchain. For the XRP community, this is more than just a project launch; it's the beginning of a new era in decentralized trading.

The measures in the Data (Use and Access) Act are being introduced over the coming months

Charities have been encouraged to take part in a consultation on new guidance around the introduction of a “soft opt-in” for electronic marketing.

The Information Commissioner's Office has this week opened a consultation on draft guidance for organisations handling data protection complaints in preparation for the Data (Use and Access) Act, which is expected to be fully introduced in the coming months.

The act will enable charities to send direct marketing messages via email, text or social media to people who either express an interest in or offer to provide support to their charity without needing the person's consent.

It will also require organisations to give customers a way of making data protection complaints, acknowledge receipt of complaints within 30 days of receiving them, take appropriate steps to respond to complaints including making appropriate enquiries and keep people informed and tell people the outcome of their complaints.

“The guidance aims to walk organisations through the new requirements and inform them of what they must, should and could do to comply,” the regulator said.

“It includes helpful tips and practical advice for each stage in the process.”

The consultation invites views on areas including the main challenges organisations would face in implementing a complaints process, the extent to which they feel the guidance helps them understand their legal obligations in this area and the costs they are likely to face as a result. 

The regulator said it might publish in full the responses received from organisations or a summary of the responses.

The consultation is open until 19 October.","{'href': 'https://www.thirdsector.co.uk', 'title': 'Third Sector'}","cryptocurrency"

- The EU accelerates its digital euro project using public blockchains like Ethereum and Solana to counter U.S. stablecoin dominance.

- Strategic shift prioritizes financial sovereignty, leveraging public chains' transparency and high-throughput capabilities for a retail-focused CBDC.

- Privacy-preserving technologies like zero-knowledge proofs address anonymity concerns, creating investment opportunities in blockchain infrastructure and privacy startups.

- Geopolitical tensions with U.S. CBDC policies drive EU's push for a sovereign digital currency, with 70+ firms testing applications on public chains.

- MiCA regulatory alignment reduces adoption friction, but holding limits and October 2025 design decisions remain key risks for investors.

The European Union's digital euro project is no longer a theoretical exercise—it is a strategic race against time. As the European Central Bank (ECB) accelerates its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) roadmap, the integration of public blockchain infrastructure and privacy-focused technologies is reshaping the global financial landscape. For investors, this represents a pivotal inflection point: the EU's pivot to Ethereum and Solana, coupled with its emphasis on zero-knowledge proofs and hybrid architectures, signals a shift in power dynamics between centralized and decentralized finance.  

For years, the ECB explored private, permissioned blockchain systems for the digital euro. But recent developments reveal a decisive pivot toward public blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. This shift is driven by three factors:1. Countering U.S. Stablecoin Dominance: The U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins (e.g., USDC, USDT) dominate global digital payments, leveraging the dollar's hegemony. By anchoring the digital euro to public blockchains, the EU aims to create a sovereign, interoperable alternative.2. Financial Sovereignty: Public blockchains offer transparency and resistance to censorship, aligning with the EU's goal of reducing reliance on U.S. payment systems.3. Technological Edge: Ethereum's programmable smart contracts and Solana's high throughput (50,000+ transactions per second) make them ideal for a retail-focused CBDC.  

This strategic reorientation has already triggered a surge in institutional interest. Over 70 fintechs, banks, and startups are now testing digital euro applications on public chains, with cross-border experiments under the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) demonstrating scalability and security.  

A critical challenge for CBDCs has always been privacy. Cash's anonymity is hard to replicate in a digital world. The ECB's solution? Hybrid blockchain models that combine public infrastructure with zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technologies.  

ZKPs allow transactions to be verified without revealing sensitive data, a feature that could attract users wary of surveillance. Companies like Zcash and Aztec Protocol are already pioneering ZKP-based solutions, positioning themselves as key players in the digital euro ecosystem. For investors, this represents a dual opportunity:- Blockchain Infrastructure Providers: Firms enabling Ethereum and Solana's scalability (e.g., Arbitrum, Sui) stand to benefit from increased CBDC-related demand.- Privacy Tech Innovators: Startups specializing in ZKPs or decentralized identity (e.g., Ceramic Network, Spruce Systems) could see valuation multiples as the EU prioritizes privacy.  

 

The EU's digital euro is not just a technical project—it's a geopolitical countermeasure. U.S. policies, including President Trump's 2025 executive orders establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and banning public CBDCs, have intensified European concerns about financial autonomy. The digital euro's adoption could reduce the euro area's reliance on U.S. payment platforms, which currently handle 61% of card transactions.  

Investors should also consider the European Payment Initiative (EPI), a pan-European digital wallet project (code-named “wero”) designed to complement the digital euro. EPI's success hinges on partnerships with blockchain infrastructure providers and cybersecurity firms, creating tailwinds for companies like Chainlink (for oracle services) and Fireblocks (for secure asset management).  

The EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, enacted in 2023, has provided a regulatory bridge between public blockchains and institutional compliance. This alignment reduces friction for adoption and signals to investors that Ethereum and Solana are now “institutional-grade” platforms.  

However, risks remain. The ECB is exploring holding limits (e.g., €3,000–€100,000) to prevent bank runs, a move that could dampen demand for the digital euro. Investors should monitor the ECB's October 2025 decision on these limits and the final design of the digital euro.  

 

The EU's digital euro is a masterclass in strategic innovation. By leveraging public blockchains and privacy-preserving technologies, the ECB is not only countering U.S. stablecoin dominance but also redefining the future of money. For investors, this is a rare opportunity to position capital at the intersection of technological sovereignty and financial transformation. As the preparation phase concludes in October 2025, the next 12 months will determine whether the digital euro becomes a cornerstone of global finance—or a cautionary tale.  

The time to act is now.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- Ripple's CTO David Schwartz successfully tested a new hub server, proving XRP Ledger's stability and scalability for institutional adoption.

- Post-SEC regulatory clarity and partnerships with SBI/Santander demonstrate XRP's growing utility in cross-border payments and CBDCs.

- Upcoming 2025 upgrades (AMM, DIDs, EVM sidechain) will enhance DeFi capabilities and bridge Ethereum's ecosystem with XRPL's speed.

- XRP's strategic value grows as institutional demand rises, supported by network effects, regulatory tailwinds, and CBDC readiness.

The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is on the cusp of a transformative phase, driven by technical advancements that could redefine its role in global finance. Ripple's recent test of a new “hub” server, spearheaded by CTO David Schwartz, has delivered results that underscore the network's growing stability and scalability—key prerequisites for institutional adoption. With the hub server poised for production deployment as early as next week, investors are now faced with a critical inflection point: a strategic opportunity to position themselves ahead of a potential surge in XRP's utility and value.  

Schwartz's three-day test of the hub server in August 2025 revealed a system capable of withstanding heavy traffic while maintaining sub-33ms latency and minimal disconnections. These metrics are not just technical benchmarks; they are proof of the XRPL's ability to support high-volume, mission-critical applications. For institutions, reliability is non-negotiable. The hub's success in reducing peer disconnection risks and optimizing bandwidth usage directly addresses a long-standing concern: the ledger's capacity to scale without compromising performance.  

The implications are profound. A stable, high-throughput network is essential for cross-border payments, tokenized asset settlements, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Ripple's roadmap for 2025—featuring an Automated Market Maker (AMM), Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and an EVM-compatible sidechain—builds on this foundation. These upgrades are not incremental; they are architectural shifts that align the XRPL with the demands of institutional-grade infrastructure.  

The regulatory clarity post-SEC ruling in August 2025 has already catalyzed a wave of institutional partnerships. SBI Holdings and Santander's expanded use of Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, for instance, has slashed cross-border settlement times from days to seconds, reducing costs by up to 70%. Meanwhile, the launch of RLUSD—a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin with dual regulatory oversight—has demonstrated XRP's versatility in hybrid financial systems.  

The technical upgrades now being deployed further solidify these partnerships. The AMM's continuous auction feature mitigates impermanent loss for liquidity providers, while DIDs enable privacy-preserving compliance—a critical factor for banks and asset managers. The EVM sidechain, set to launch in Q2 2025, will bridge Ethereum's developer ecosystem with the XRPL's speed and low fees, attracting protocols seeking scalable infrastructure.  

For investors, the convergence of technical robustness and institutional traction creates a compelling case for XRP. The hub server's readiness for production marks a tangible step toward the XRPL's integration into traditional finance. Consider the following:  

The hub server's deployment next week is a catalyst worth capitalizing on. Historically, XRP has exhibited strong price momentum ahead of major upgrades, as seen in its 2025 rally following the SEC ruling. With institutional demand surging and technical upgrades nearing completion, the asset is primed for a re-rating.  

Investors should consider a long-term position in XRP, leveraging its role in cross-border payments, DeFi, and CBDC ecosystems. Short-term volatility is likely, but the fundamentals—robust network performance, regulatory clarity, and institutional partnerships—point to a multi-year bull case.  

In conclusion, Ripple's XRP Ledger is not just a payment network; it is an evolving platform for institutional finance. The recent technical advancements, coupled with real-world adoption, make XRP a strategic buy for those seeking exposure to the next phase of blockchain-driven financial infrastructure. As the hub server goes live, the market will soon price in the XRPL's potential to redefine global money movement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Stablecoins could transform how we exchange money. The U.S. and China want to take charge","https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-us-stablecoin-global-economy-1.7615601","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 02:27:00 GMT","

Like a 21st-century space race, the world's biggest economic powers are staking their claim in a little-known type of digital currency that could revolutionize — or severely disrupt — the way people, companies and countries exchange money.

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a country's national currency, or to commodities like gold. The idea is that their value is linked to a stable asset, and is therefore less prone to volatility than regular crypto. 

Think of it as a ""digital dollar"": Stablecoins have a one-for-one exchange rate with their real-world twins, which investors keep in a reserve as collateral against more volatile types of crypto. The digital coins are designed to be converted into the material asset that they're linked to at any moment, from anywhere in the world, and without extra costs.

""Right now, obviously, stablecoins are not super popular. You can't go into a Loblaws and pay for your groceries with stablecoins,"" said Claire Wilson, a policy and research analyst at the Council of Canadian Innovators.

""But it's conceivable that in the future, because they enable faster transactions and have lower transaction fees, that they could be more widely used.""

Months after the U.S. passed a regulatory framework giving companies clarity on how to issue and accept stablecoins, China is reportedly looking to do the same — expanding the use of its own currency around the world, and challenging the dominance of the U.S. dollar.

Stablecoins have been around since 2014, when U.S. company Tether launched the first of its kind, tied to the U.S. dollar. While the currency hasn't yet entered mainstream use, ""one of the biggest use cases that proponents often mention is remittances,"" according to Wilson.

Champions say that stablecoins will make international money transfers less costly — including for immigrants who, while sending remittances back to family members in their birth country, are smacked with steep cross-border fees.

""So normally if you're sending money back often to Latin America [or] Africa, the bank fees are a lot less trivial than sending money between, let's say, Canada and Germany,"" said Wilson.

Stablecoins exist on a blockchain, which is a decentralized system that records and verifies transactions between computers. Unlike traditional payment methods, there's no bank operating as a middleman between point A and point B.

That makes the transfer of payments faster and smoother — but critics worry that stablecoins, like other forms of crypto, can be used for illegal financial transactions because they bypass the traditional infrastructure that financial systems use to guard against illicit activity. 

There's also a concern that the coins, still largely untested in public waters, could lead to a crash similar to a bank run. If stablecoins lost their one-to-one value, customers might lose confidence and rush to withdraw the stablecoins in physical dollars, prompting a crash. That's what happened with the collapse of the Terra-Luna stablecoin in 2022.

Only recently have major countries established regulatory frameworks to oversee the dissemination of stablecoins. U.S. President Donald Trump's GENIUS Act was passed in July, opening the door for private companies to issue and accept stablecoins — but the legislation was also criticized by Democrats for not having adequate fraud and corruption protection measures.

Now, Amazon and Walmart are reportedly looking into developing their own stablecoins, as are big U.S. banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Across the pond, the EU passed its own framework with MiCA, or Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, in 2023.

Trump signs GENIUS Act cryptocurrency legislation

Stablecoins are similar to but distinct from central bank-issued digital currencies, which are issued by a country's central bank and backed by the government. They are also not the same thing as equities, like publicly-traded stocks from Amazon or Apple, because they don't generate profits over time.

Both in Europe and the U.S., stablecoins were classified as e-money tokens, rather than as securities, under their regulatory frameworks. Canada, by contrast, recognizes the digital coins as securities — which some view as a regulatory error that makes it hard for people to issue stablecoins backed by Canadian assets.

""Canada, in general, is quite a fintech-friendly country, but it's also cautious,"" said Katrin Tinn, an associate professor of finance at McGill University. ""When it comes to the discussions around central bank digital currencies, it was among the very first central banks to explore it and investigate it.""

But the Bank of Canada quietly dropped its central bank digital currency project last year, saying it would instead focus on preparing for the evolution of payments in Canada and around the world through policy research and analysis.

Right now, the majority of stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar, according to recent research from the Bank for International Settlements.

Other countries are rushing to regulate stablecoins so that they can hedge against American currency dominance as matter of national sovereignty, said Wilson.

The U.S. dollar has for years been the world's reserve currency of choice, but that reputation was thrown into question earlier this year when foreign investors appeared to be pulling out of the U.S. Treasury bonds market. The country's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that he thinks stablecoins will boost the appeal of Treasuries. 

Therein lies the problem for countries from Canada to China. ""If you just have stablecoins that are backed by the U.S. dollar, people are going to want to buy those and they're going to take money out of your banking system and they're going to be stored in U.S. reserves,"" she said.



China made a big bet when it launched its central bank digital coin in 2019, challenging private companies like Alipay and WeChat as they staked their claim in the country's digital payments market, according to Christian Catalini, the founder of MIT's Cryptoeconomics Lab and former chief economist of Meta FinTech.

Now, with the U.S. having passed a regulatory framework for private companies to experiment with stablecoins, ""China is probably realizing that central bank digital currencies may not be the right technological platform and they might be too slow [to develop],"" said Catalini, who was part of the team behind Facebook's now-defunct stablecoin, Demi.

""No government wants to use some other government's infrastructure,"" he said.

Catalini argues that the U.S. has shaped the last few decades of foreign policy and geopolitics with institutions like the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and by imposing sanctions on its adversaries. 

""But of course, China has greater ambitions and so as the role of China changes, I think you should expect more and more technology coming also from the East,"" he said.

Could China's yuan really challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar? It's extremely unlikely — but ""stranger things have happened,"" said Catalini.

""Typically we've seen with major wars, with major reshuffling of the global economic order, new currencies may emerge as the standard.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Are struggling firms using crypto reserves as a PR lifeline?","https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-treasuries-lifeline-or-last-resort","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 12:48:56 GMT","

 Corporate Bitcoin treasuries nearly doubled in H1 2025, but analysts warn some firms may be using crypto reserves as a short-term PR boost. 

Corporate adoption of crypto in treasury management is growing rapidly. In the first half of 2025, the tally of public companies holding BTC nearly doubled, according to a report from K33 Research.

K33 revealed that between December 2024 and June 2025, the number of listed firms with Bitcoin (BTC) on their balance sheets climbed from 70 to 134, amassing a total of 244,991 BTC.

The trend is drawing comparisons to earlier waves of corporate gold adoption. “There are clear parallels, particularly around providing a means for investors to access an underlying asset which they may have previously struggled to access,” Mike Foy, chief financial officer at AMINA Bank, told Cointelegraph.

Foy said the movement's sustainability hinges on market specifics and regulatory environments. “Time will tell if this becomes a sustainable trend, but it is clear that strategy has a first mover advantage,” he noted, adding that companies in jurisdictions with limited access to institutional crypto products stand to benefit the most.

Notably, the crypto treasury trend is also fueling skepticism that struggling firms may be using digital assets as a reputational lifeline. Foy acknowledged that the temptation exists for firms under pressure.

Last month, biotech firm Windtree Therapeutics disclosed a $60 million purchase agreement with Build and Build Corp. to begin its BNB treasury plan, followed by a $500 million equity line of credit and a $20 million stock-purchase pact to expand its holdings.

The company briefly enjoyed a boost in mid-July when it announced the BNB treasury strategy, but shares have since fallen more than 90% from their peak.

On Tuesday, Nasdaq announced the biotech firm would be delisted for failing to maintain the $1.00 minimum bid price required under Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).

Foy suggested examining their behavior to spot firms using crypto treasury for short-term optics. He advised checking management's risk expertise, leverage levels, focus on core business and insider share sales.

""If any of these seem strange or out of the ordinary, then this is possibly a sign that this isn't a long term plan but rather a short term share price play,” he said.

While Bitcoin remains the dominant choice for treasuries, firms are beginning to experiment with Ether (ETH) and selected altcoins. The difference, according to Foy, lies in the potential for staking rewards and new collaboration opportunities with blockchain foundations.

Last month, Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes, said Ethereum's hybrid appeal is drawing treasury managers. “Ethereum starts to look like a hybrid between tech equity and digital currency. This appeals to treasury strategists looking beyond passive storage,” he said.

Youssef said ETH's staking yield, programmability and compliance-friendly roadmap have made the cryptocurrency appealing to “forward-looking companies, especially those already involved in the digital economy.”

 For more than a decade, stablecoins have offered the promise of the benefits of cryptocurrency with stability of the U.S. dollar —an ideal stablecoin would always be worth $1. 


 However, as Congress considers historic legislation related to these assets, worth more than $250 billion as of August 2025, research reveals a problem with their models: the more effort they make to maintain their dollar peg, the more vulnerable they may be to catastrophic runs.


 The Trump administration has prioritized stablecoin legislation, predicting these tokens would ""ensure American dollar dominance internationally."" However, an NBER study reveals a fundamental problem at the heart of stablecoin design. The same mechanisms that keep stablecoin prices at $1 can make them more prone to panic runs—not less. In short, the findings challenge conventional wisdom that more competition in markets provides more stability by revealing a previously unrecognized tradeoff between daily price stability that stable coins demand and the ability to come back from a crisis.


 Here is a table showing some of the major players in the industry, with their level of concentration, which we discuss below:


 Unlike your bank account, you can't directly cash out most stablecoins with their issuers. Instead, there's a two-tiered system:


 The researchers modeled various common triggers that could spark a crisis:


 Arbitrageurs act as intermediaries who buy stablecoins when others sell, helping maintain the $1 price. But the research reveals a crucial twist: Having more arbitrageurs keeping the dollar peg doesn't mean less risk—it means more. It's helpful to remember two points about stablecoins that prove crucial for the study:


 With that in mind, the researchers pointed out what would happen should there be a run on the two biggest stablecoins:


 Tether (USDT, just six dealers on average):


 Circle (USDC, with 521 dealers on average):


 An analogy financial experts often use for market runs is a building's emergency exit. In this case, here's how the analogy works:


 In other words, the paradox is that arbitrageurs, by doing their job in the market, could cause the sell-off and drop in stablecoin prices they were meant to prevent. By holding the exit doors open, they invite the stampede.


 The study's model puts numbers on the scale of the hidden risk:


 As the researchers note, ""Both Tether and Circle have significant run risk"" despite their different approaches. ""Tether has more illiquid assets but Circle has less concentrated arbitrage, which amplifies run risk.""


 Why does this matter? The typical approach to addressing this problem would be to require more arbitrageurs, as too few insiders might not have the necessary resources to prevent a devastating run. However, it turns out that simply increasing the number of arbitrageurs also creates significant risks. What's more, there's no way out of this tradeoff: either you have price stability—as stablecoins promise in their very name—or you have less resilience should a crisis hit.


Annual risks of 3.3% to 3.9% might seem small, but consider the following: analyzing government data, we calculate that your risk of a similar issue in your Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-backed account is 1/3900th less (0.001%), which itself is far less than your chances of getting hit by lightning in a given year (0.03%). Meanwhile, if you held a stablecoin for 10 years, you'd have about a one-in-three shot of experiencing major problems.

 Research reveals that not only are stablecoins far riskier than their names suggest, but in a 10-year period, you'd have about a one in three chance of a major run on assets. Given their central role in the $3.87 trillion crypto ecosystem and the paradox that potential solutions to address their inherent risks could make them even more fragile, this means any system that includes crypto assets is built on foundations far shakier than many people realize.


 Worse, as they grow in market value, the study shows, the more dangerous this hidden instability becomes.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- EU explores Ethereum/Solana for digital euro, diverging from China's closed CBDC model and aligning with U.S. open stablecoins.

- ECB delays final decision but prioritizes public blockchain integration to enhance interoperability while balancing privacy and regulation.

- Public blockchain adoption risks increased state control over decentralized infrastructure but could challenge dollar-dominated stablecoin dominance.

- China expands e-CNY with centralized network (7.3T yuan transactions) while Hong Kong regulates stablecoins to enable yuan-backed alternatives.

- ECB tests COTI blockchain for confidential payments, highlighting tension between financial sovereignty and global digital currency competition.

The European Union is actively considering the use of public blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Solana, as foundational infrastructure for its digital euro initiative, according to recent reports from the Financial Times and other sources [1]. This move marks a potential departure from earlier considerations of private blockchain models and could position the digital euro in contrast to the Chinese central bank digital currency (CBDC) approach, which operates on a closed network [1]. It also aligns the EU with the more open infrastructure seen in U.S. stablecoins, such as those issued by Circle [1].

The ECB has not yet finalized its decision on the technological framework for the digital euro, but officials have begun treating public blockchains with increased seriousness. A source with knowledge of the discussions noted that a digital euro on a private blockchain would resemble China's CBDC more closely than the decentralized, dollar-pegged stablecoins prevalent in the United States [1]. The ECB's Governing Council is expected to make a final decision on whether to proceed with the digital euro by the end of 2025 [1].

The decision to explore public blockchains comes amid growing concerns over the dominance of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins in global transactions, which account for nearly 98% of the market. These stablecoins, including Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, are widely used in cross-border payments and are seen as strengthening the dollar's influence in the global financial system [4]. In response, European officials have called for a digital euro that can interoperate with global blockchain infrastructure while preserving financial sovereignty [1].

Juan Ignacio Ibañez of the MiCA Crypto Alliance highlighted both the potential and the challenges of a public blockchain-based digital euro. On the one hand, such a design could better integrate with existing decentralized infrastructure, including decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. On the other hand, it could also open the door to greater state influence over blockchain governance [1]. The debate reflects a broader tension between decentralization and regulatory control in the digital currency space.

In parallel with the ECB's efforts, China has continued to expand its own digital currency initiatives, including the e-CNY, launched in 2019. The Chinese digital yuan operates on a centralized, government-controlled network and has been deployed in several cities, with state media reporting over 7.3 trillion yuan in transactions as of July 2024 [2]. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has moved to regulate stablecoins, requiring them to maintain reserves equal to their issued value, signaling a possible path toward a yuan-backed stablecoin [2].

The ECB has also pursued pilot projects, including a collaboration with the COTI blockchain to test confidential digital payment mechanisms for the digital euro [3]. These efforts aim to balance privacy with regulatory compliance, a critical concern for any CBDC.

As the EU weighs its options, the digital euro remains a strategic project with far-reaching implications for the future of European monetary sovereignty and the global financial landscape. The choice of a public blockchain could enhance interoperability and technological adoption but also introduce new governance and regulatory challenges [1].

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- The 2025 crypto market has split into two ecosystems: innovation-driven infrastructure projects and speculative retail-driven assets.

- Projects like BlockDAG (10 TPS DAG-PoW), Snorter Bot (MEV-resistant trading), and Cold Wallet (L2 integration) focus on scalable blockchain solutions with institutional backing.

- Speculative coins like Maxi Doge (383% APY) and PepeNode (4,700% APY) rely on viral hype and gamified mechanics but lack long-term technical foundations.

- Investors must balance exposure to infrastructure-focused projects with high-risk speculative assets, as institutional capital increasingly prioritizes verifiable utility over short-term gains.

The 2025 cryptocurrency market is no longer a monolith. It has fractured into two distinct ecosystems: one anchored in technological innovation and institutional credibility, and the other driven by retail speculation and meme-driven hype. This divide is not merely a reflection of market sentiment but a structural shift in how value is created—and extracted—within the crypto space. For investors, understanding this duality is critical to navigating a landscape where the line between transformative infrastructure and fleeting trends grows increasingly blurred.  

At the core of the innovation-led segment are projects like BlockDAG, Snorter Bot, and Cold Wallet (CWT). These initiatives are redefining blockchain's utility by addressing scalability, security, and real-world adoption.  

BlockDAG, for instance, combines Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with Proof-of-Work (PoW) to achieve 10 transactions per second (TPS), a leap forward from legacy blockchains. Its $377 million presale capital and institutional partnerships underscore its potential to become a foundational layer for decentralized applications. Meanwhile, Snorter Bot (SNORT) is automating trading with sub-second execution times and MEV resistance, targeting both retail and institutional traders. With a 137% staking APY and cross-chain expansion plans, it exemplifies how technical depth can attract diverse capital.  

Cold Wallet (CWT) further illustrates this trend by integrating Layer 2 (L2) solutions to reduce transaction costs and introduce gasless rewards. Its $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet and 2 million active users highlight its role as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto. These projects are not just chasing token price appreciation; they are building infrastructure that could redefine financial transactions, security protocols, and remittance systems.  

In contrast, the speculative segment thrives on viral branding, high-yield staking, and gamified mechanics. Meme coins like Maxi Doge (MAXI) and PepeNode (PEPENODE) have captured retail attention with APYs exceeding 300% and social media-driven narratives. Maxi Doge's 383% staking reward and PepeNode's 4,700% APY—though unsustainable in the long term—have attracted millions of users seeking quick gains.  

These projects rely on community momentum rather than technical execution. For example, PepeNode's virtual mining simulation leverages Ethereum block activity to reward users, but its value proposition hinges on sustained social traction. Similarly, Maxi Doge's roadmap includes a gamified futures platform, yet its lack of institutional backing raises questions about scalability. While these assets may generate short-term returns, their volatility and dependence on sentiment make them high-risk bets.  

The 2025 crypto market's duality demands a nuanced investment strategy. Technology-driven projects, though often less flashy, offer tangible utility and long-term value. BlockDAG's hybrid DAG-PoW model, for instance, addresses blockchain's scalability trilemma—a problem that has plagued the industry for over a decade. Similarly, Cold Wallet's integration of L2 solutions aligns with broader trends in decentralized finance (DeFi), where user experience and cost efficiency are paramount.  

Conversely, speculative projects like Maxi Doge and PepeNode cater to a different demographic: retail investors seeking liquidity and social validation. While these assets can deliver outsized returns during bull cycles, their lack of foundational innovation makes them vulnerable to regulatory scrutiny and market corrections. The $4.11 trillion crypto market capitalization as of August 2025 is driven largely by institutional adoption and ETF accumulation, not retail speculation. This suggests that the speculative segment, though vibrant, is unlikely to sustain long-term growth without a shift toward utility.  

For investors seeking sustainable alpha, the path forward lies in projects that combine technical innovation with real-world use cases. BlockDAG's institutional partnerships and EVM compatibility position it as a scalable infrastructure layer, while Snorter Bot's MEV-resistant trading tools address a critical gap in automated finance. Cold Wallet's gasless rewards and cross-chain integration further demonstrate how blockchain can democratize access to financial services.  

In contrast, speculative projects require a high-risk, high-reward mindset. Investors in this space must monitor social sentiment, liquidity pools, and regulatory developments closely. However, allocating a significant portion of a portfolio to these assets without a clear exit strategy could expose investors to sharp drawdowns during market downturns.  

The 2025 crypto market's deepening divide between innovation and speculation is not a temporary phenomenon—it is a structural evolution. As institutional capital continues to flow into projects with verifiable utility, the speculative segment will likely remain a volatile but necessary component of the ecosystem. For investors, the key is to balance exposure to both categories while prioritizing projects that align with long-term technological progress.  

In the end, the next wave of crypto alpha will belong to those who recognize that blockchain's true potential lies not in the noise of social media, but in the quiet revolution of code and infrastructure.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","SpacePay's Presale Introduces Technology That Could Change the Future of Crypto Transactions","https://cryptonews.com/press-releases/spacepays-presale-introduces-technology-that-could-change-the-future-of-crypto-transactions/","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 11:45:00 GMT","

SpacePay's presale gives investors a chance to join a project aiming to shape the future of payments. The platform is building a system that makes using crypto for everyday purchases fast and affordable.

Based in London and backed by global investors, SpacePay works with hundreds of wallets so people can spend crypto as easily as a bank card. 

It keeps costs low for both shoppers and merchants and has already raised over a million dollars in its presale. The goal is to make crypto payments part of daily life everywhere.

Many crypto payment systems are hard to use because they work differently from the payment methods people already know. Customers want quick and easy payments without delays or high fees. 

Merchants need a system that is steady and dependable. These problems have made it hard for crypto to be used in physical stores, even though more people now own it.

SpacePay is designed to fix these issues. It can handle heavy payment traffic without slowing down. It works with more than 325 wallets, including MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and Ledger, meaning customers can pay directly from the wallets they already use.

The system also connects to existing payment terminals through an APK. Shops do not need to buy new hardware to start accepting crypto payments. On busy days, such as holiday sales, SpacePay is built to process every payment quickly and efficiently.

SpacePay offers instant settlement. When a customer pays, the shop receives the money right away. This could be a better choice compared to most traditional banking systems. It also protects merchants from price changes in crypto. 

If a customer pays in Ethereum, the shop still gets the exact amount in their local currency, regardless of whether the ETH price changes during the payment. This system is made possible through its volatility protection mechanism, which locks the crypto funds as soon as the payments are processed.

The platform supports many cryptocurrencies. Customers can use Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins such as USDT, and more. Merchants only pay a 0.5% fee per transaction, which is lower than most bank card fees.

Let's look at a simple example of how SpacePay can be used: A tourist can check into a hotel and pay instantly in crypto. The hotel receives the exact amount they expected in their local currency, with no waiting and no surprise charges.

The SpacePay presale is happening at a time when the crypto world is looking for real uses beyond trading. SpacePay's focus on speed, low fees, and a simple user experience makes it stand out. 

With instant settlement, protection from price swings, and support for hundreds of wallets, it has the tools to make crypto a normal way to pay. For those who believe crypto should be as easy to spend as cash, joining the SPY presale is a way to be part of that future.

The SPY token powers the SpacePay system. There are 34 billion tokens in total. The supply is divided between the public sale, user rewards, partnerships, development, and marketing.

Holding SPY comes with benefits. Token holders can vote on decisions, gain early access to new features, and receive loyalty rewards. They can also share in part of the platform's revenue.

The presale is more than a way to raise money; it helps build the network by bringing in early supporters. The funds will be used to expand the system, attract more merchants, and add features.

The price of SPY increases at each stage of the presale, meaning early buyers get a better deal. It is a way to join a project focused on making crypto easy to spend anywhere.

To buy SPY in the presale, connect a wallet such as MetaMask to the SpacePay presale page. You can pay with ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, BASE, USDC, USDT, or a bank card.

Once your wallet is connected and has funds, choose how much SPY you want to buy. Confirm the transaction and ensure you have enough left to pay the network fees.

After the swap, your SPY tokens will be sent to your wallet and ready to use when SpacePay launches.

Kraken has acquired the assets and technology of Capitalise.ai, a company that developed natural language trading automation technology. 

The acquisition will bring no-code trading capabilities to Kraken Pro users across multiple asset classes.

Founded in 2015, Capitalise.ai built a platform that converts text instructions into executable trading strategies. 

The company's proprietary language model processes real-time and historical data across equities, cryptocurrency, foreign exchange, futures and options markets. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

A phased rollout of Capitalise.ai's functionality within Kraken Pro is expected to begin later this year. 

The technology will enable users to design, test and automate trading strategies without coding requirements.

The acquisition addresses complexity issues that have emerged as Kraken Pro has evolved. Making full use of the platform's features increasingly requires technical skill and deep trading expertise, creating barriers for some users.

Capitalise.ai removes that barrier by enabling clients of all backgrounds to design, test and automate complex strategies using simple, everyday language. 

Users will be able to automate strategies across digital and traditional asset classes without writing code.

Shannon Kurtas, Kraken Head of Exchange, says the acquisition provides clients with new real-time capabilities. 

“This acquisition gives Kraken Pro clients a powerful new way to act on ideas in real time: testing, optimising and executing bespoke strategies with unprecedented speed and confidence,” she says.

Capitalise.ai technology has been deployed by traditional finance brokers and exchanges with what Kraken describes as compelling results. The company claims it ranks among the most engaging automation tools in the retail and institutional space.

The acquisition includes key personnel from Capitalise.ai. CEO Amir Shiovich and Chief Product Officer Shahar Rabin will join Kraken along with product and engineering staff. The team will continue development work within Kraken's Pro business unit.

The deal follows Kraken's US$1.5bn acquisition of US futures platform NinjaTrader in March, signalling the exchange's expansion beyond cryptocurrency into traditional financial markets.

The transaction reflects broader trends in the cryptocurrency industry, where companies are increasingly acquiring artificial intelligence startups. 

In January, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis acquired fraud detection startup Alterya for approximately US$150m. The same month, Web3 platform xPortal purchased German AI startup Alphalink.

In August, Tether and video platform Rumble announced a joint US$1.17bn bid for Northern Data, an AI and high-performance computing provider. Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings struck a US$168m deal to acquire a stake in French AI firm Exaion on the same day.

“Capitalise.ai's technology transforms how people interact with financial data, breaking down barriers that have long kept scalable, advanced strategies in the hands of a few""

Capitalise.ai demonstrated its technology at FinovateSpring 2017 in San Francisco, where it won Best of Show. The company showed how its platform could translate financial, social and weather data into investment ideas across multiple asset classes.

Kraken supports more than 15 million clients across 190 countries and processes more than US$207bn in quarterly trading volume. The exchange has positioned itself as a multi-asset platform enabling trading across digital and traditional financial instruments.

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a Stifel company, acted as financial adviser to Capitalise.ai in the transaction.

“Capitalise.ai's technology transforms how people interact with financial data, breaking down barriers that have long kept scalable, advanced strategies in the hands of a few. This is a major leap forward in democratising access to pro-grade trading tools,” Kurtas says.

Blockchain investigator ZachXBT revealed on Thursday that a social engineering scam led to the theft of about $91.4 million in bitcoin.

A crypto investor in the United States lost 783 bitcoin—valued at $91.4 million—after falling victim to a scammer posing as a technical support agent. The fraudster obtained the investor's wallet password and emptied the account within seconds.

Similar schemes are on the rise, with industry estimates suggesting that as much as $3.1 billion could be stolen from digital wallets through such methods by 2026.

The attack, which occurred on Aug. 19, saw the perpetrator impersonate a hardware wallet support representative and trick the victim into surrendering their wallet credentials, resulting in the loss of 783 bitcoin.

The incident reflects a broader pattern of social engineering scams seen last year. It adds to what has already been a difficult 2025 for crypto investors, who lost $3.1 billion to attacks and fraud in the first half alone.

Once the transfer was made, the stolen funds were funneled through a typical laundering process, including multiple deposits into Wasabi Wallet, a privacy tool often used to obscure transaction trails.","{'href': 'https://www.turkiyetoday.com', 'title': 'Türkiye Today'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Ether Likely to Top $5K, BTC Eyes Record High as Powell Sparks Rally; Watch for DAT Deal Risks: Asset Managers","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/23/ether-likely-to-top-usd5k-btc-eyes-record-high-as-powell-sparks-rally-watch-for-dat-deal-risks-asset-managers","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 05:18:06 GMT","

Cryptocurrencies surged late Friday after Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell struck a dovish tone at the Jackson Hole economic symposium, defying market expectations for a more hawkish stance. That has prompted asset managers to call for new all-time highs for bitcoin BTC$115,059.46, ether (ETH) and select altcoins.

In one of his most important speeches, Powell suggested that the labor market could benefit from lower borrowing costs, having held the benchmark interest rate steady at 4.25% for eight months.

“Downside risks to employment are rising,” Powell said in prepared remarks for his keynote speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium, adding that the possibility of President Donald Trump's tariffs having only a short-lived effect on inflation is “reasonable.”

“With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” he noted.

Cryptocurrencies and stocks soared, and the probability of the September Fed rate cut jumped to 90% following the speech. Most analysts expect the momentum to continue in the days ahead.

Analysts at Monarq Asset Management anticipate that ether's price will rise above $5,000 in the coming days.

""We maintain our overall bullish stance. Market internals remain constructive, with few signs of overheating and, as you point out, a clear path to new all-time highs in both BTC and ETH,"" Sam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management's Directional Fund, told CoinDesk.

""Our house view is that Powell's dovish pivot has cleared the way for $5,000+ in the near term (also not the hardest call to make). Demand from treasury vehicles should increase into the fall as many of the deals announced this summer close or de-SPAC, in addition to ongoing institutional and retail inflows,"" Gaer added.

Ethereum's native token ether has already gained nearly 10% in 24 hours, hitting record highs above $4,800. As of writing, it changed hands at $4,700, according to CoinDesk data. Meanwhile, market leader bitcoin traded near $115,600, slightly down from the overnight high of $117,400.

Data from Deribit-listed options shows that ether's rally has sparked renewed demand for upside bets, or call options. At press time, risk reversals were positive across all tenors, implying relative richness of calls. The sentiment wasn't so bullish in BTC options.

Gaer stated that over-the-counter desks and market makers are experiencing stronger demand for ETH compared to BTC, suggesting that ether may outperform ahead.

That said, BTC looked strong on its own, too. ""The BTC pullback from ATH was ~9.6%—far less than earlier drawdowns this year—indicating strong demand, as evidenced by whale wallet accumulation around the $113k level,"" Gaer said.

Spencer Yang, managing partner at BlockSpaceForce, a crypto treasury advisory firm, said more rate cuts could happen after September, ensuring the momentum extends well into the year-end.

""We're now fully expecting rate cuts to happen in September. It will be the first cut since Trump became President this year. This is significant, and many more will come,"" Yang said, calling new highs in the crypto market.

""The major 5 that we pay attention to: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, LINK. These will do well given the various parts of the crypto industry they impact,"" Yang added.

Steve Lee, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital and investor in BlockTower Capital, called Powell's dovish turn a short-term constructive development for cryptocurrencies while stressing the importance of continued inflows into bitcoin and ether spot ETFs.

""I see this as constructive in the short term, and it may help reverse this week's sell-off. The key question is whether this momentum holds beyond the low-liquidity weekend. Since BTC and ETH price action is increasingly institutionally driven, spot ETF flows today and Monday will be a strong indicator of whether we are set for another leg higher,"" Lee told CoinDesk.

Lee highlighted Base, Monad, Story, and SUI as key projects of interest that he is closely monitoring in his capacity as an early-stage venture capitalist.

Gaer, meanwhile, favored Solana and the SOL ecosystem, including high-beta SOL tokens such as JITO and JUP. Raydium and PUMP on both a ""fundamental and forward-demand basis.""

While Powell's dovish stance has set the stage for a rally, traders should remain cautious about potential pitfalls from corporate treasury cryptocurrency adoption and volatility in equity markets.

""Digital asset treasuries"" (DAT) are an innovative vehicle for public market investors to gain exposure to the digital asset space. However, we have started to see the quality of DAT deals – from banking relationships, compliance, management team, and deal structure perspectives — dropping, which shows early signs of a 'bubble,"" Lee said.

Naqsdaq-listed Strategy started this trend of corporate BTC adoption in 2020. Since then, more than 100 publicly-listed firms have accumulated a total of 984,971 BTC, according to data source Bitcoin Treasuries. 

""The trend may continue, but it is obvious that the risks associated with this are not ignorable,"" Lee added.

Gaer called for closely tracking risks from an overheated equity market and ""potential for macro or geopolitical shocks.""

The stage is set.","https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/08/23/genius-was-just-the-prologue-stablecoins-represent-a-platform-shift-in-payments-the-stage-is-set","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 11:40:21 GMT","

Every era of economic transformation has begun the same way: with infrastructure that seems niche – until it isn't.



Early irrigation systems unlocked the first cities. Early railroad networks rewired entire economies. The internet's core protocols, TCP/IP, turned slow and siloed information networks into a single, global system of communication. And the Cloud turned idle servers into the foundation of the digital economy.



We don't remember them for how they started. We remember them for how they scaled. Because in effect, what once looked like niche experiments became the backbone of global markets.



Stablecoins are next. Welcome to the age of the stablecoin layer: an open, programmable foundation for global money movement.



Just last year, stablecoins lacked clear regulation and were dismissed by much of the financial establishment. Fast forward a matter of months, and the U.S. Congress has passed the GENIUS Act, creating the country's first federal framework for stablecoins and defining them explicitly as payment instruments. Major banks and card networks have entered this space. Early-movers like Circle have made their Wall Street debut. And fintech leaders from Stripe to Shopify are embracing stablecoins to power faster, cheaper, always-on transactions.



These aren't isolated milestones. They're early signs that stablecoins are on track to become core infrastructure, just like AWS became the quiet engine of the cloud economy. Stablecoins represent a platform shift in payments. Just like prior platform shifts – mainframe computing to individual computers, desktop to mobile, and on-premises to cloud-based infrastructure – stablecoins will unlock a wave of innovation by modernizing financial infrastructure. This is the tipping point, but it's also only the beginning, and too many people are still thinking far too small.



To many, dollars are still shackled to outdated infrastructure like wire transfers and ACH. None of it is built for composability, automation, or machine-to-machine interaction as is required in the modern age. It's a slow-motion relic holding back an interconnected, global economy that wants to move faster and include more people. Until we modernize the rails, we're capping the true velocity of money – and with it, global economic potential.



Stablecoins snap that bind. No bank holidays, no middlemen, no concept of business days or hours. Just global, cheap, and instantaneous settlement at scales of billions of dollars at a time. That transformation is as fundamental as turning mail into email.



Stablecoins offer what legacy financial infrastructure simply can't: instant settlement, borderless reach, low costs, and programmable design. They will disrupt more than any other crypto building block – rewriting payments, liquifying capital markets, and bringing the internet's speed and interoperability to money itself.



This shift goes well beyond payments between people. Stablecoins will also underpin the next phase of AI-native commerce as sovereign AI agents abandon legacy fiat systems in favor of decentralized money that flows freely across blockchain infrastructure. This will power automated treasury flows, agentic commerce, machine-to-machine transactions, and sovereign AI agent transactions.



Money is getting an upgrade.



The stablecoin layer isn't just a new system, it's a new substrate for the global economy. The velocity of money movement is positively correlated with economic growth. Stablecoins will unlock trillions in latent economic activity and help grow global GDP by full percentage points each year. And all of this activity will be AI-native.



Yet for all the progress, the opportunity is still in its infancy. The GENIUS Act was a critical milestone, but it's still one piece of legislation. And while the stablecoin market cap sits at over $280 billion today, the U.S. M2 money supply – the total amount of money circulating within the US economy – exceeds $20 trillion. That's nearly a 100:1 gap.



We're still underselling how fast and forceful the shift to the stablecoin standard will be, and how quickly AI will accelerate it. Put simply, this summer marked only the soft launch of the stablecoin era. The infrastructure is in place, and the scale of what's coming far exceeds the conversation today.



This shift won't be loud, and that's by design. In a few years, no one will say they're “using stablecoins,” just like nobody says they're “using cloud computing” to store pictures of their kids. They'll just use money. And stablecoins will be the infrastructure powering it all behind the scenes, moving billions across the globe in real time.



The biggest winners in this transition will be the platforms operating behind the scenes: those who power the rails, provide liquidity, and earn our trust. Fintechs will use stablecoins for instant settlement and global reach. Governments – eventually, reluctantly – will integrate stablecoins into critical economic functions. AI agents will speak the language of stablecoins natively.



This isn't a bet on crypto hype. It's a recognition that our financial system needs an upgrade, and stablecoins are the gateway. They're not just a better form of money; they're the onramp to the onchain economy. Once users hold stablecoins, they're one step away from accessing a global, open, and programmable financial system. That's why the stablecoin layer isn't just the most important sector in crypto – it's the foundation for the future of digital currency.

Ethereum's breakout past $4,800 triggered nearly $388 million in liquidations tied to the token in the past 24 hours, data shows, marking the heaviest flush across all crypto assets.

The wipeout was part of $769 million liquidated marketwide, with over 183,000 traders forced out of positions. The single biggest hit was a $10 million ETH swap order on OKX, an unusually high figure for the token, which is often second to bitcoin-based positions.

Liquidations serve as a stark reminder of how fragile positioning can be in the crypto market. When traders pile in with leverage and the market moves against them, exchanges step in and automatically close those bets.

A flush of long liquidations can reset the market for a cleaner bounce, while a cluster of short wipes can fuel the next leg higher.

The move came as ether surged almost 15% to a record $4,885 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested rate cuts could arrive in September. Bitcoin lagged with a 4% gain to $113,000, while the CoinDesk 20 Index climbed 9%.

Analysts say the rally isn't just a macro trade. Institutional buying and treasury allocations have added a tailwind, feeding speculation that Ethereum could become Wall Street's preferred blockchain.

“Ether's new all-time high is a clear sign of investor demand beyond just bitcoin,” said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, said in an email to CoinDesk. “I would expect ETH to surpass $10k once we start to see stablecoin solutions being implemented for payments within the U.S.”

That $10,000 target, once deemed overly optimistic, is increasingly voiced as Ethereum cements itself as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenization, and smart contracts. The year-to-date gain for ETH now stands at 45%.

 Thai police have arrested a South Korean man accused of helping a call center gang launder over $50 million in crypto into gold. 

Thai authorities have arrested a South Korean man accused of helping a call center gang launder cryptocurrencies into gold worth more than $50 million.

The Technology Crime Suppression Division (TCSD) said officers apprehended Han, 33, at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport on Saturday under a warrant issued in February, according to a report from The Nation. He faces charges of fraud, computer crimes, money laundering, and involvement in a criminal syndicate.

The case stems from a large-scale call center scam that began in early 2024. Victims were lured into “investment opportunities” promising 30%–50% returns. Initial payouts created a false sense of security, but as deposits grew, withdrawals were blocked with claims that investors had failed to meet requirements.

Dozens of complaints eventually reached the TCSD, prompting a probe that has already led to the arrest of ten suspects, including five alleged launderers and five mule account holders.

Investigators discovered Han's arrival in Thailand and coordinated with the Immigration Bureau to detain him at the airport checkpoint. His mobile phone, containing multiple crypto accounts tied to the laundering network, was seized.

According to the report, Han previously studied in China before joining a South Korean company that converted cryptocurrencies into gold bars for the scam network. He allegedly oversaw crypto accounts receiving victim funds, which were then used to purchase gold from overseas suppliers before being shipped back to the syndicate.

Authorities estimate that between January and March 2024, Han's accounts processed roughly 47.3 million USDt (USDT), funneled into gold. Each laundering round reportedly involved more than 10 kilograms of gold, valued at about $1 million per transaction.

Han has denied parts of the charges but remains in custody as Thai police continue investigating the wider network.

Taiwanese prosecutors have indicted 14 individuals in what they describe as the nation's largest cryptocurrency money laundering case, involving more than 1,500 victims and over $70 million in illicit proceeds.

The Shilin District Prosecutor's Office filed charges for fraud, money laundering and organized crime, seeking the confiscation of nearly $40 million in illicitly obtained assets.

Authorities also requested the seizure of 640,000 USDt, undisclosed amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) and Tron (TRX), more than $1.8 million in cash, two luxury cars and $3.13 million in frozen bank deposits.

Prosecutors said the group laundered the funds by converting cash into foreign currency and then buying USDt through local exchange BiXiang Technology before transferring the assets abroad.

 Brazil's 17.5% crypto tax signals a global shift as governments eye digital assets for revenue, ending the era of tax-friendly crypto investing worldwide. 

Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly

Crypto may be the first tax lever governments pull when scrambling for more revenue, if Brazil's recent move is anything to go by.

In June, Brazil scrapped its tax exemption for minor crypto gains and introduced a flat 17.5% tax on all capital gains from digital assets, regardless of the amount. The decision was part of a broader effort by the Brazilian government to bolster revenue through increased taxation of financial markets. 

This is more than a local tax tweak. A clear pattern is emerging where governments are finding ways to extract more tax from the asset class. Around the world, policymakers are taking a fresh look at crypto as a revenue opportunity. 

It was only in 2023 that Portugal brought in a 28% tax on crypto gains held for less than a year, a significant change for a country that had long treated crypto as tax-free.

The real question now is how long countries with crypto-friendly tax policies can hold the line before following suit, and which will be the next to tighten the screws.

Germany, for example, currently exempts crypto gains from capital gains tax if the assets are held for more than one year. Even for holdings under a year, gains of up to 600 euros ($686) annually remain tax-free. 

Meanwhile, the United Kingdom offers a broader 3,000 pounds ($3,976) capital gains tax-free allowance on all assets, including crypto, although that amount was slashed by 50% from 6,000 pounds in 2023, signaling possible further cuts in the future.

While it might seem like a small change, further reducing the 3,000-pound threshold could generate significant tax revenue, especially with recent Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) data showing that 12% of UK adults now hold crypto.

It's hard to imagine that it's entirely off the table, especially as UK government debt increases.

The era of retail crypto investors enjoying a gray zone of regulatory leniency is closing. As the crypto market matures and prices continue to surge, governments are taking notice of the media headlines covering crypto's explosive growth.

This is especially true in emerging markets, where governments are under increasing pressure to plug budget gaps without setting off political backlash from more visible or controversial tax hikes. 

No other asset matches Bitcoin's average annualized return of 61.2% over the past five years.

Luckily, crypto is a reasonably easy tax target for governments. It's often seen as risky, speculative and perceived as mainly benefiting the wealthy. While taxing it isn't as controversial with the public, it also brings downsides, especially for everyday investors and startups.

For example, Brazil's 17.5% structure hit small traders disproportionately hard. 

While big institutions can absorb the costs or relocate to jurisdictions with more favorable rules, everyday users, including those using crypto for saving in inflation-prone economies, bear the cost.

With the increasing odds that other governments will follow Brazil and Portugal's example, the era of low-tax or tax-free crypto investing may end.

The question isn't whether other crypto-friendly nations will tighten their grip on crypto taxation; it's how fast and hard it is.

 Bitcoin chased its range highs after the Federal Reserve hinted at a policy pivot during the closing speech of the Jackson Hole Symposium. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin surged 5% to $117,300 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at an upcoming interest rate cut, liquidating $379.88 million in shorts.

Analysts say the BTC “uptrend is back,” with the potential to hit $200,000 before the end of the year.

Bitcoin (BTC) took out the ask liquidity above $117,000 on Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential September interest rate cut during his speech at Jackson Hole.

BTC price rose more than 4% to an intraday high of $117,300 on Bitstamp from a six-week low of $111,600.

According to CoinGlass data, $379.88 million in short positions were liquidated, with Ether (ETH) accounting for $193 million of that total as it soared nearly 15% to $4,760. Bitcoin followed with $56.4 million in short liquidations.

Across the board, a total of $629.48 million was wiped out of the market in short and long positions, as shown in the figure below.

The sudden market recovery led to the liquidation of 150,217 traders over the period, catching many off guard as investor sentiment flipped to bullish.

The Bitcoin liquidation heatmap showed the price eating away liquidity above $117,000, with more than $259.5 million ask orders sitting between $117,000 and $118,000. 

BTC's swept lows below $112,000, providing traders with a good entry position, according to MN Capital Founder Michael van de Poppe.

Earlier in the week, van de Poppe told his X followers to be on the lookout for a sweep beneath the Aug. 3 low of $111,900 as a great area to accumulate.

“A small sweep took place and an immediate massive move upward on #Bitcoin,” he said in a X post on Friday, adding:

Fellow analyst Jelle said that it is likely that the Bitcoin price could retrace following today's pump, but one thing remains clear: “The market wants higher.”

It comes as several crypto industry participants recently shared forecasts for higher prices in the crypto market. Analyst BitQuant said on Monday that his cycle top target of $145,000 for Bitcoin was still in play throughout 2025.  

Meanwhile, Bitwise's head of European research André Dragosch said in Cointelegraph's Chain Reaction daily X spaces show on Monday that US President Donald Trump's move to allow crypto in 401(k) retirement plans could push Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of the year.

 Concerns are rising among Bitcoiners over institutions doing ""institutional-like things"" with Bitcoin, Preston Pysh said in a recent podcast interview. 

Early Bitcoin adopters aren't likely to stop being skeptical of institutional adoption anytime soon, says Bitcoin venture fund Ego Death Capital co-founder Preston Pysh.

“Part of that culture that brought it to where it is, is looking at where this is all going and saying no, no, no, no, this is all moving in a bad direction,” Pysh told Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast on Friday.

Pysh said that institutions engaging in “institutional-like things,” such as Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives, have some Bitcoiners concerned about the long-term impact and whether Bitcoin can still serve as the safe-haven asset it once was.

“Am I being scammed, like all the other scams that preceded this wave?” is a question Pysh says some of the Bitcoin community are asking as institutional interest grows.

The comments come amid ongoing debate in the Bitcoin community over whether growing institutional interest is moving Bitcoin away from its original purpose.

“For people who have made Bitcoin what it is, getting it here, over a trillion dollars, involved individuals, for the most part, self-custodying Bitcoin, holding onto the keys for dear life through 70% and 80% downturns and still not selling them,” Pysh said, adding:

It comes nearly a month after a heated debate on social media when crypto analyst Scott Melker, also known as The Wolf of All Streets, said that Bitcoin “is amazing” but has been taken over to some extent by the people it was created as a hedge against.

Meanwhile, Ryan McMillin, chief investment officer at Merkle Tree Capital, recently told Cointelegraph that old Bitcoin being sold to new institutions is a sign of its “integration with the financial system.” 

Pysh explained that the Bitcoin ethos is being challenged, and he expects it to continue facing scrutiny as institutional interest expands.

“I think that it's going to move in a direction where a lot of people use Bitcoin the way they wanna use Bitcoin, especially institutions, who are going to use it very differently to how individuals use it,” Pysh said.

“That's a difficult pill for people to swallow,” he said.

“At large, part of the Bitcoin culture is to be pretty much skeptical of everything and to question everything,” he added.

According to a March 18 report by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon, 83% of institutional investors surveyed said they plan to increase crypto allocations in 2025.

The Brain's Map of the Body Is Surprisingly Stable—Even after a Limb Is Lost

The brain's body map doesn't reorganize itself after limb amputation, a study found, challenging a textbook idea in neuroscience

By Katie Kavanagh & Nature magazine 

The brain's map of the body in the primary somatosensory cortex remains unchanged after amputation.

A brain-imaging study of people with amputated arms has upended a long-standing belief: that the brain's map of the body reorganizes itself to compensate for missing body parts.

Previous research had suggested that neurons in the brain region holding this internal map, called the primary somatosensory cortex, would grow into the neighbouring area of the cortex that previously sensed the limb.

But the latest findings, published in Nature Neuroscience on 21 August, reveal that the primary somatosensory cortex stays remarkably constant even years after arm amputation. The study refutes foundational knowledge in the field of neuroscience that losing a limb results in a drastic reorganization of this region, the authors say.

“Pretty much every neuroscientist has learnt through their textbook that the brain has the capacity for reorganization, and this is demonstrated through studies on amputees,” says study senior author Tamar Makin, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. But “textbooks can be wrong”, she adds. “We shouldn't take anything for granted, especially when it comes to brain research.”

The discovery could lead to the development of better prosthetic devices, or improved treatments for pain in ‘phantom limbs' — when people continue to sense the amputated limb. It could also help scientists working to restore sensation in people who have had amputations.

Study first author Hunter Schone, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, says that previous reports from some people with amputations had led him and his colleagues to doubt the idea that the brain's map of the body is reorganized after amputation. These maps are responsible for processing sensory information, such as touch or temperature, at specific body regions. “They would say: ‘I can still feel the limb, I can still move individual fingers of a hand I haven't had for decades,'” Schone says.

To investigate this contradiction, the researchers followed three people who were due to undergo amputation of one of their arms. The team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the cortical representations of the body before the surgery, and then after the amputation for up to five years. It is the first study to do this.

Before their amputations, participants performed various movements, such as tapping their fingers, pursing their lips and flexing their toes while inside an fMRI scanner that measured the activity in different parts of the brain. This allowed the researchers to create a cortical ‘map' showing which regions sensed the hand. To test the idea that neighbouring neurons redistribute in the cortex after amputation, they also made maps of the adjacent cortical area — in this case, the part that processes sensations from the lips. The participants repeated this exercise several times after their amputation, tapping “with their phantom fingers”, says Schone.

The analysis revealed that the brain's representation of the body was consistent after the arm was amputated. Even five years after surgery, the cortical map of the missing hand was still activated in the same way as before amputation. There was also no evidence that the cortical representation of the lips had shifted into the hand region following amputation — which is what previous studies suggested would happen.

Makin says their study is “the most decisive direct evidence” that the brain's in-built body map remains stable after the loss of a limb. “It just goes against the foundational knowledge of the field,” she says.

Solaiman Shokur, a neuroengineer at the Sant'anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, Italy, says he was surprised to see the evidence shown “in such a clear manner” and that the results “contradict something that is believed in the field, and do so to some extent”.

Giacomo Valle, a neuroengineer at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, praised the study's methodology and says it “puts a final dot — or conclusion — on the debate” about the brain's map of the body following amputation. “This is important proof,” he adds.

He says that the findings could have implications for research on prosthetic limbs that are controlled through brain–computer interfaces implanted in the somatosensory cortex. The information is relevant to the recruitment of volunteers in clinical trials of such devices and for potential participants who might benefit from brain–computer interfaces, he says.

The study authors note that their findings also explain why treatments for phantom limb pain aimed at ‘reversing' reorganization in the brain's map have shown limited success. “Researchers may have missed the profound resilience of cortical representations,” they write.

It started in Canada and now it's inching closer to Siberia. Thanks a lot, blobs.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The magnetic north pole just isn't where it used to be. 

Ever since the British polar explorer James Clark Ross first identified it on the Boothia Peninsula in Canada's Nunavut territory in 1831, scientists have been carefully measuring its location. But in recent years, our north pole has been inching closer and closer to Siberia at a surprisingly rapid pace.

Researchers from the United Kingdom and Denmark uncovered the reason for this mysterious movement: two writhing lobes of magnetic force, duking it out near Earth's core.

“The wandering of Earth's north magnetic pole, the location where the magnetic field points vertically downwards, has long been a topic of scientific fascination,” the researchers write in their paper, which appears in the journal Nature Geoscience. 

Earth's magnetic field is generated by molten iron in its outer core. The flow of this liquid iron can influence the location of the planet's magnetic poles. While poles have drifted and even swapped places numerous times over the course of Earth's long history, what's different about this recent shift is how quickly it's happening. From 1999 to 2005, Earth's magnetic north pole went from shifting nine miles at most each year to as much as 37 miles in a year.    

These scientists pored over 20 years of satellite data from the European Space Administration's Swarm satellite mission and discovered that “over the last two decades the position of the north magnetic pole has been largely determined by two large-scale lobes of negative magnetic flux on the core–mantle boundary under Canada and Siberia,” according to the study.

Between 1970 and 1999, the flow of molten, magnetic material in Earth's outer core changed. Because of these changes, the researchers say, the magnetic blob lurking beneath Canada slowly elongated in the early aughts, weakening the corresponding magnetic intensity on Earth's surface. 

Eventually, the blob of molten material beneath Canada split in two and the stronger one slowly shifted toward the blob beneath Siberia. This spurred the magnetic north pole to slip closer and closer to Siberia, where the magnetic intensity was stronger.  

In 2017, the North Magnetic Pole fell within 240 miles of the geographic pole. With the release of the World Magnetic Model 2025, NOAA and the British Geological Survey rolled out an updated model—plus a first-ever high-resolution version—to keep navigation aligned with Earth's shifting field and to update the near-pole “blackout zones.” The pole continues its march out of the Canadian Arctic toward Siberia at about 28 miles per year. 

The scientists generated a series of models of Earth's core in an effort to understand how it might move in the future. “Our predictions are that the pole will continue to move towards Siberia, but forecasting the future is challenging and we cannot be sure,” the study's lead author, geophysicist Phil Livermore of the University of Leeds, told Live Science. 

These shifts have major consequences for global navigation systems. Anything or anyone that uses a compass—from ships at sea to the smartphones in our pockets—is impacted by this magnetic game of tug-of-war.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists found the missing nutrients bees need — Colonies grew 15-fold","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250822073807.htm","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 09:56:05 GMT","

A new study led by the University of Oxford in collaboration with Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, University of Greenwich, and the Technical University of Denmark could provide a cost-effective and sustainable solution to help tackle the devastating decline in honeybees. An engineered food supplement, designed to provide essential compounds found in plant pollen, was found to significantly enhance colony reproduction. The results were published on August 20 in the journal Nature.

The challenge: addressing a critical nutrient deficiency 

Climate change and agricultural intensification have increasingly deprived honeybees of the floral diversity they need to thrive. Pollen, the major component of their diet, contains specific lipids called sterols necessary for their development. Increasingly, beekeepers are feeding artificial pollen substitutes to their bees due to insufficient natural pollen. However, these commercial supplements -- made of protein flour, sugars, and oils -- lack the right sterol compounds, making them nutritionally incomplete.

In the new study, the research team succeeded in engineering the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to produce a precise mixture of six key sterols that bees need. This was then incorporated into diets fed to bee colonies during three-month feeding trials. These took place in enclosed glasshouses to ensure the bees only fed on the treatment diets.

Key findings:

Senior author Professor Geraldine Wright (Department of Biology, University of Oxford), said: ""Our study demonstrates how we can harness synthetic biology to solve real-world ecological challenges. Most of the pollen sterols used by bees are not available naturally in quantities that could be harvested on a commercial scale, making it otherwise impossible to create a nutritionally complete feed that is a substitute for pollen.""

Lead author Dr Elynor Moore (Department of Biology, University of Oxford at the time of the study, now Delft University of Technology) added: ""For bees, the difference between the sterol-enriched diet and conventional bee feeds would be comparable to the difference for humans between eating balanced, nutritionally complete meals and eating meals missing essential nutrients like essential fatty acids. Using precision fermentation, we are now able to provide bees with a tailor-made feed that is nutritionally complete at the molecular level.""

From pollen to precision nutrition: Identifying and producing key bee sterols

Before this work, it was unclear which of the diverse sterols in pollen were critical for bee health. To answer this, the researchers chemically assessed the sterol composition of tissue samples harvested from pupae and adult bees. This required some extraordinarily delicate work; for instance, dissecting individual nurse bees to separate the guts. The analysis identified six sterol compounds that consistently made up the majority in bee tissues: 24-methylenecholesterol, campesterol, isofucosterol, β-sitosterol, cholesterol, and desmosterol.

Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, the researchers then engineered the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to produce these sterols in a sustainable and affordable way. Y. lipolytica was selected since this yeast has a high lipid content, has been demonstrated as food-safe, and is already used to supplement aquaculture feeds. To produce the sterol-enriched supplement, engineered yeast biomass was cultured in bioreactors, harvested, then dried into a powder.

Co-author Professor Irina Borodina (The NNF Center for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark) said: ""We chose oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as the cell factory because it is excellent at making compounds derived from acetyl-CoA, such as lipids and sterols, and because this yeast is safe and easy to scale up. It is used industrially to produce enzymes, omega-3 fatty acids, steviol glycosides as calorie-free sweeteners, pheromones for pest control, and other products.""

Benefits for agriculture and biodiversity

Pollinators like honeybees contribute to the production of over 70% of leading global crops. Severe declines -- caused by a combination of nutrient deficiencies, climate change, mite infestations, viral diseases, and pesticide exposure -- poses a significant threat to food security and biodiversity. For instance, over the past decade, annual commercial honey bee colony losses in the U.S have typically ranged between 40 and 50%, and could reach 60 to 70% in 2025. This new engineered supplement offers a practical means to enhance colony resilience without further depleting natural floral resources. Since the yeast biomass also contains beneficial proteins and lipids, it could potentially be expanded into a comprehensive bee feed.

Co-author Professor Phil Stevenson (RBG Kew and Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich) added: ""Honey bees are critically important pollinators for the production of crops such as almonds, apples, and cherries and so are present in some crop locations in very large numbers, which can put pressure on limited wildflowers. Our engineered supplement could therefore benefit wild bee species by reducing competition for limited pollen supplies.""

Danielle Downey (Executive Director of honeybee research nonprofit Project Apis m., not affiliated with the study) said: ""We rely on honey bees to pollinate one in three bites of our food, yet bees face many stressors. Good nutrition is one way to improve their resilience to these threats, and in landscapes with dwindling natural forage for bees, a more complete diet supplement could be a game changer. This breakthrough discovery of key phytonutrients that, when included in feed supplements, allow sustained honey bee brood rearing has immense potential to improve outcomes for colony survival, and in turn the beekeeping businesses we rely on for our food production.""

Next steps and future applications

Whilst these initial results are promising, further large-scale field trials are needed to assess long-term impacts on colony health and pollination efficacy. Potentially, the supplement could be available to farmers within two years.

This new technology could also be used to develop dietary supplements for other pollinators or farmed insects, opening new avenues for sustainable agriculture.

The British evolutionary biologist JBS Haldane is said to have quipped that any divine being evidently had 'an ordinate fondness for beetles'. This bon mot conveyed an important truth: the 'tree of life' - the family tree of all species, living or extinct - is very uneven. In places, it resembles a dense thicket of short twigs; elsewhere it has only sparse but long branches. A few groups tend to predominate: as Haldane pointed out, more than 40% of extant insects are beetles, while 60% of birds are passerines, and more than 85% of plants are flowering plants.

But is such a concentration of species within a few exceptionally large groups a universal phenomenon of life on Earth? This question, important for our understanding of evolution and ecology, has long been the subject of controversy among biologists. But until recently, it was difficult to answer due to our poor knowledge of the number of species in existence, their evolutionary relationships, and the age of each group. But now, scientists in the US finally have provided an answer, published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution.

""Here we show for the first time that most living species do indeed belong to a limited number of rapid radiations: that is, they form groups with many species which evolved in a relatively short period of time,"" said Dr John J. Wiens, a professor at the University of Arizona.

""Specifically, if we look among the kingdoms of life, among animal phyla, and among plant phyla, we find in each case that more than 80% of known species belong to the minority of groups with exceptionally high rates of species diversification.""

Wiens and his coauthor Dr Daniel Moen, an assistant professor at the University of California Riverside, here analyzed the distribution of species richness and diversification rates across 'clades' - groups of species that each evolved from a single ancestor, such as phyla, classes, or families.

Out on a limb

They did this for land plants, insects, vertebrates, for all animals, and for all species across life. They analyzed data on each clade's species richness, age, and estimated diversification rate: that is, the accumulation of new species over time.

They focused on 10 phyla, 140 orders, and 678 families of land plants, jointly spanning more than 300,000 species; 31 orders and 870 families of insects, encompassing more than one million known species; 12 classes of vertebrates, encompassing more than 66,000 species; and 28 phyla and 1,710 families of animals with more than 1.5 million species. Finally, they analyzed 17 kingdoms and 2,545 families across all of life, including more than 2 million species.

The results were clear and consistent: irrespective of hierarchical level or group of organisms, the majority of extant species proved to be restricted to a few disproportionately large clades with higher-than-average diversification rates.

'Rapid radiations' of species are thought to occur when a new ecological niche opens up: for example, when a flock of grassquit birds dispersed from Central America to the virgin territory of the Galápagos Islands approximately 2.5 million years ago to diversify into the famous Darwin's finches; or when an evolutionary innovation like powered flight prompted the radiation of bats 50 million years ago.

Seeing the forest for the trees

""Our results imply that most of life's diversity is explained by such relatively rapid radiations. We also suggest key traits that might explain these rapid radiations, based on our results and results of earlier studies,"" said Wiens.

""These traits include multicellularity in plants, animals, and fungi across the kingdoms of life; the invasion of land and the adoption of a plant-based diet in arthropods among animal phyla; and the emergence of flowers and insect pollination in flowering plants among plant phyla,"" said Wiens.

However, one 'known unknown' remains: the distribution of species within the kingdom bacteria. Approximately 10,000 species of bacteria are known to science, but current estimates for the true number range from millions to trillions. However, the origin of bacteria dates back to 3.5 billion years ago, and so the overall diversification rate among them is actually quite low.

""If actual bacterial richness really is much higher than described richness for other groups, then a clade with low diversification rates [namely bacteria] would contain the majority of species across life - this would be in stark contrast to our results. Therefore, we caution that our results apply primarily to known species diversity,"" wrote the authors.

Scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital demonstrated for the first time that the protein midkine plays a preventative role against Alzheimer's disease. Midkine is known to accumulate in Alzheimer's disease patients. Now, researchers have connected it with amyloid beta, a protein that accumulates in the brain, causing assemblies that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's.

In work published on August 21 in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, the researchers revealed that midkine prevents amyloid beta from sticking together, and, consequently, Alzheimer's disease models lacking midkine show more amyloid beta accumulation. The findings lay the groundwork to better understand the disease-preventing mechanism of midkine and subsequent drug discovery pathways.

Midkine blocks Alzheimer's amyloid assembly growth

Midkine is a small, multifunctional growth factor protein found abundantly during embryonic development but also involved in normal cell growth. Its role in cell growth means that midkine is often overexpressed in cancer, making it a valuable biomarker. However, beyond some preliminary studies showing its increase in Alzheimer's, midkine's link to the neurodegenerative disease has been poorly understood.

Corresponding author Junmin Peng, PhD, Departments of Structural Biology and Developmental Neurobiology, and his team utilized fluorescence assays, circular dichroism, electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance with disease models that replicate amyloid beta accumulation to investigate the role of midkine in Alzheimer's thoroughly. They found that midkine and amyloid beta have a similar pattern at the protein level.

""We know that correlation is not causative, so we wanted to demonstrate convincingly that real interactions are occurring between the two proteins,"" Peng explained.

The researchers used a fluorescent sensor for amyloid beta assemblies, called thioflavin T, to show that the assemblies were broken up in the presence of midkine. Modeling of those data revealed that midkine inhibits amyloid beta elongation and secondary nucleation, two specific phases during assembly formation. Nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed this finding.

""Once the amyloid beta assemblies grow, the signal becomes weaker and broader until it disappears because the technique can only analyze small molecules,"" said Peng. ""But when we add in midkine, the signal returns, showing that it inhibits the large assemblies.""

Additionally, the researchers used Alzheimer's disease mouse models that have increased amyloid beta and demonstrated that removing the midkine gene resulted in even higher levels of amyloid beta assemblies. These results point to the protective role the protein has against Alzheimer's disease.

The researchers have opened a potential avenue for drug discovery by identifying the apparent protective role of midkine. ""We want to continue to understand how this protein binds to amyloid beta so we can design small molecules to do the same thing,"" said Peng. ""With this work, we hope to provide strategies for future treatment.""

If an extraterrestrial intelligence were looking for signs of human communications, when and where should they look? In a new study, researchers at Penn State and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California analyzed when and where human deep space transmissions would be most detectable by an observer outside our solar system and suggest that the patterns they see could be used to guide our own search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

""Humans are predominantly communicating with the spacecraft and probes we have sent to study other planets like Mars,"" said Pinchen Fan, graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics in the Penn State Eberly College of Science, science principal investigator of the NASA grant supporting this research and first author of the paper. ""But a planet like Mars does not block the entire transmission, so a distant spacecraft or planet positioned along the path of these interplanetary communications could potentially detect the spillover; that would occur when Earth and another solar system planet align from their perspective. This suggests that we should look for alignment of planets outside of our solar system when searching for extraterrestrial communications.""

A paper describing the research was published on August 21 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

""SETI researchers often search the universe for signs of past or present technology, called technosignatures, as evidence of intelligent life,"" Fan said. ""Considering the direction and frequency of our most common signals gives insights into where we should be looking to improve our chances of detecting alien technosignatures.""

The researchers analyzed logs from NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN), a system of ground-based facilities that permits two-way radio communications with human-made objects in space, acting as a relay to send commands to spacecraft and receive information they send back. The research team carefully matched up DSN logs with information about spacecraft locations to determine the timing and directionality of radio communications from Earth. Although several countries have their own deep-space networks, the researchers said that the NASA-run DSN should be representative of the types of communications coming from Earth, in part because NASA has led most deep-space missions to date.

""NASA's Deep Space Network provides the crucial link between Earth and its interplanetary missions like the New Horizons spacecraft, which is now outbound from the Solar System, and the James Webb Space Telescope,"" said Joseph Lazio, project scientist at JPL and an author of the paper. ""It sends some of humanity's strongest and most persistent radio signals into space, and the public logs of its transmissions allowed our team to establish the temporal and spatial patterns of those transmissions for the past 20 years.""

For this study, the researchers focused on transmissions to deep space, including transmissions to telescopes in space as well as interplanetary spacecraft, instead of transmissions intended for spacecraft or satellites in low-Earth orbit, which are relatively low power and would be difficult to detect from a distance.

The researchers found that deep space radio signals were predominantly directed toward spacecraft near Mars. Other common transmissions were directed toward other planets and to telescopes at Sun-Earth Lagrange points -- points in space where the gravity of the Sun and Earth keep the telescopes in a relatively fixed position as viewed from Earth.

""Based on data from the last 20 years, we found that if an extraterrestrial intelligence were in a location that could observe the alignment of Earth and Mars, there's a 77% chance that they would be in the path of one of our transmissions -- orders of magnitude more likely than being in a random position at a random time, Fan said. ""If they could view an alignment with another solar-system planet, there is a 12% chance they would be in the path of our transmissions. When not observing a planet alignment, however, these chances are minuscule.""

To improve our own search for technosignatures, the researchers said, humans should look for alignment of exoplanets -- planets outside our solar system -- or at least when exoplanets align with their host star.

Astronomers frequently study exoplanets during alignment with their host star. In fact, most of the currently known exoplanets were detected by looking for the darkening of a star when a planet crosses in front of, or transits, its host star from Earth's line of sight.

""However, because we are only starting to detect a lot of exoplanets in the last decade or two, we do not know many systems with two or more transiting exoplanets,"" Fan said. ""With the upcoming launch of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, we expect to detect a hundred thousand previously undetected exoplanets, so our potential search area should increase greatly.""

Because our solar system is fairly flat with most planets orbiting on the same plane, the majority of DSN transmissions occurred within 5 degrees of Earth's orbital plane, the researchers explained. If the solar system were a dinner plate with all the planets and objects sitting on that plate, human transmissions tended to follow along the plate's surface, rather than shooting out into space at a stark angle.

The research team also calculated that an average DSN transmission could be detected about 23 light-years away using telescopes like ours. Focusing efforts, they said, on solar systems that are within 23 light-years and especially whose plane is oriented with its edge toward Earth could improve our search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The team now plans to identify these systems and quantify how frequently they could have received signals coming from Earth.

The DSN transmission patterns found also could be applied to searches for laser transmissions from exoplanets, the researchers said, though they noted that lasers would have much less spillover than radio transmission. NASA is testing its interplanetary laser communication system, and extraterrestrial civilizations may opt to use lasers instead of radio waves.

""Humans are pretty early in our spacefaring journey, and as we reach further into our solar system, our transmissions to other planets will only increase,"" said Jason Wright, professor of astronomy and astrophysics in the Penn State Eberly College of Science, director of the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center, and an author of the paper. ""Using our own deep space communications as a baseline, we quantified how future searchers for extraterrestrial intelligence could be improved by focusing on systems with particular orientations and planet alignments.""

Funding from the NASA Exoplanets Research Grant Program and the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center supported this work. Computations for this research were performed on the Penn State Institute for Computational and Data Sciences Roar supercomputer.

Physicists have developed a breakthrough concept in quantum encryption that makes private communication more secure over significantly longer distances, surpassing state-of-the-art technologies. For decades, experts believed such a technology upgrade required perfect optical hardware, namely, light sources that strictly emit one light particle (photon) at a time -- something extremely difficult and expensive to build. But the new approach uses innovative encryption protocols applied to tiny, engineered materials called quantum dots to send encrypted information securely, even with imperfect light sources. Real-world tests show it can outperform even the best of current systems, potentially bringing quantum-safe communication closer to everyday use.

A team of physicists has made a breakthrough that could bring secure quantum communication closer to everyday use -- without needing flawless hardware.

The research, led by PhD students Yuval Bloom and Yoad Ordan, under the guidance of Professor Ronen Rapaport from theRacah Institute of Physics at Hebrew University in collaboration with researchers from Los-Alamos National Labs, and published in PRX Quantum, introduces a new practical approach that significantly improve how we send quantum encrypted information using light particles -- even when using imperfect equipment.

Cracking a 40-Year-Old Challenge in Quantum Communication

For four decades, the holy grail of quantum key distribution (QKD) -- the science of creating unbreakable encryption using quantum mechanics -- has hinged on one elusive requirement: perfectly engineered single-photon sources. These are tiny light sources that can emit one particle of light (photon) at a time. But in practice, building such devices with absolute precision has proven extremely difficult and expensive.

To work around that, the field has relied heavily on lasers, which are easier to produce but not ideal. These lasers send faint pulses of light that contain a small, but unpredictable, number of photons -- a compromise that limits both security and the distance over which data can be safely transmitted, as a smart eavesdropper can ""steal"" the information bits that are encoded simultaneously on more than one photon.

A Better Way with Imperfect Tools

Bloom, Ordan, and their team flipped the script. Instead of waiting for perfect photon sources, they developed two new protocols that work with what we have now -- sub-Poissonian photon sources based on quantum dots, which are tiny semiconductor particles that behave like artificial atoms.

By dynamically engineering the optical behavior of these quantum dots and pairing them with nanoantennas, the team was able to tweak how the photons are emitted. This fine-tuning allowed them to suggest and demonstrate two advanced encryption strategies:

In simulations and lab experiments, these techniques outperformed even the best versions of traditional laser-based QKD methods -- extending the distance over which a secure key can be exchanged by more than 3 decibels, a substantial leap in the field.

A Real-World Test and a Step Toward Practical Quantum Networks

To prove it wasn't just theory, the team built a real-world quantum communication setup using a room-temperature quantum dot source. They ran their new reinforced version of the well-known BB84 encryption protocol -- the backbone of many quantum key distribution systems -- and showed that their approach was not only feasible but superior to existing technologies.

What's more, their approach is compatible with a wide range of quantum light sources, potentially lowering the cost and technical barriers to deploying quantum-secure communication on a large scale.

""This is a significant step toward practical, accessible quantum encryption,"" said Professor Rapaport. ""It shows that we don't need perfect hardware to get exceptional performance -- we just need to be smarter about how we use what we have.""

Co-Lead author Yuval Bloom added, ""We hope this work helps open the door to real-world quantum networks that are both secure and affordable. The cool thing is that we don't have to wait, it can be implemented with what we already have in many labs world-wide""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists discover forgotten particle that could unlock quantum computers","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250823083645.htm","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 12:44:40 GMT","

Quantum computers have the potential to solve problems far beyond the reach of today's fastest supercomputers. But today's machines are notoriously fragile. The quantum bits, or ""qubits,"" that store and process information are easily disrupted by their environment, leading to errors that quickly accumulate.

One of the most promising approaches to overcoming this challenge is topological quantum computing, which aims to protect quantum information by encoding it in the geometric properties of exotic particles called anyons. These particles, predicted to exist in certain two-dimensional materials, are expected to be far more resistant to noise and interference than conventional qubits.

""Among the leading candidates for building such a computer are Ising anyons, which are already being intensely investigated in condensed matter labs due to their potential realization in exotic systems like the fractional quantum Hall state and topological superconductors,"" said Aaron Lauda, professor of mathematics, physics and astronomy at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the study's senior author. ""On their own, Ising anyons can't perform all the operations needed for a general-purpose quantum computer. The computations they support rely on 'braiding,' physically moving anyons around one another to carry out quantum logic. For Ising anyons, this braiding only enables a limited set of operations known as Clifford gates, which fall short of the full power required for universal quantum computing.""

But in a new study published in Nature Communications, a team of mathematicians and physicists led by USC researchers has demonstrated a surprising workaround. By adding a single new type of anyon, which was previously discarded in traditional approaches to topological quantum computation, the team shows that Ising anyons can be made universal, capable of performing any quantum computation through braiding alone. The team dubbed these rescued particles ""neglectons,"" a name that reflects both their overlooked status and their newfound importance. This new anyon emerges naturally from a broader mathematical framework and provides exactly the missing ingredient needed to complete the computational toolkit.

From mathematical trash to quantum treasure

The key lies in a new class of mathematical theories called non-semisimple topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). These extend the standard ""semisimple"" frameworks that physicists typically use to describe anyons. Traditional models simplify the underlying math by discarding objects with so-called ""quantum trace zero,"" effectively declaring them useless.

""But those discarded objects turn out to be the missing piece,"" Lauda explained. ""It's like finding treasure in what everyone else thought was mathematical garbage.""

The new framework retains these neglected components and reveals a new type of anyon -- the neglecton -- which, when combined with Ising anyons, allows for universal computation using braiding alone. Crucially, only one neglecton is needed, and it remains stationary while the computation is performed by braiding Ising anyons around it.

A house with unstable rooms

The discovery wasn't without its mathematical challenges. The non-semisimple framework introduces irregularities that violate unitarity, a fundamental principle ensuring that quantum mechanics preserve probability. Most physicists would have seen this as a fatal flaw.

But Lauda's team found an elegant workaround. They designed their quantum encoding to isolate these mathematical irregularities away from the actual computation. ""Think of it like designing a quantum computer in a house with some unstable rooms,"" Lauda explained. ""Instead of fixing every room, you ensure all of your computing happens in the structurally sound areas while keeping the problematic spaces off-limits.""

""We've effectively quarantined the strange parts of the theory,"" Lauda said. ""By carefully designing where the quantum information lives, we make sure it stays in the parts of the theory that behave properly, so the computation works even if the global structure is mathematically unusual.""

From pure math to quantum reality

The breakthrough illustrates how abstract mathematics can solve concrete engineering problems in unexpected ways.

""By embracing mathematical structures that were previously considered useless, we unlocked a whole new chapter for quantum information science,"" Lauda said.

The research opens new directions both in theory and in practice. Mathematically, the team is working to extend their framework to other parameter values and to clarify the role of unitarity in non-semisimple TQFTs. On the experimental side, they aim to identify specific material platforms where the stationary neglecton could arise and to develop protocols that translate their braiding-based approach into realizable quantum operations.

""What's particularly exciting is that this work moves us closer to universal quantum computing with particles we already know how to create,"" Lauda said. ""The math gives a clear target: If experimentalists can find a way to realize this extra stationary anyon, it could unlock the full power of Ising-based systems.""

In addition to Lauda, other authors include the study's first author, Filippo Iulianelli, and Sung Kim of USC, and Joshua Sussan of Medgar Evers College of The City University of New York.

First, they showed the world how easy it is to add facial recognition to Meta's smart glasses. Now, they're making their own pair of smart specs.

Former Harvard students Caine Ardayfio and AnhPhu Nguyen this week announced Halo, a startup of roughly 11 people working to develop always-recording smart glasses.

The pair dropped out of Harvard to develop Halo X, smart glasses with a display on the lens that can answer any question someone asks. Powered by a combination of Google's Gemini and Perplexity large language models, the idea is that these glasses will always be listening to the world around you via the built-in microphones (there won't be a camera in this first model.)

If someone asks, “What's the capital of Peru?” just look at the display on the glasses, and you'll be able to see the answer. At least that's the idea. The processing will still run from your phone. “We're trying to build smart glasses that make people super intelligent,” Ardayfio tells WIRED. If you have a pair of smart glasses from Even Realities, you can give the startup's Halo app a spin (it's in beta). But the plan is for Halo to craft a custom pair by the first quarter of 2026, with an estimated cost between $300 and $500.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

AI-powered always-on recording wearables are having a moment in 2025—Amazon recently acquired one such startup called Bee AI, which makes a wrist-worn always-recording wearable. These devices transcribe the people around you, and often summarize your day, with the ability to extrapolate tasks and insights from your conversations. Halo X will have these features too—you can talk to it like you would a voice assistant—but its focus is on speedily delivering answers to questions during real-life conversations.

The company claims it can respond to most queries in 900 milliseconds or less, and web-searched queries in under 2.5 seconds. Much of the processing will happen in the cloud on Halo's servers with standard encryption, and Halo says it will never train on, share, or sell your conversations. Should you tell the people you're around that your glasses are recording conversations, even if no audio files are stored? “The onus is on the user to responsibly use it just like any other AI note taker,"" Nguyen says.

Halo has been in development for only eight weeks, and the company has raised $1 million in pre-seed funding. The duo is working at breakneck speed because the smart glasses space is moving very fast. “Every big company understands that wearables are potentially the next computing interface,"" Nguyen says. ""Startups have that advantage that if we ship fast and move fast, and still do it as high quality, we can quickly gain market share.”

Meta is expected to unveil its display-enabled smart glasses in September, and the first wave of Google's Android XR smart glasses will arrive in 2026. If you like Halo's approach, you can make a $249 deposit now for the Halo X.

Google held its annual hardware event this week, where it launched new Pixel 10 phones, a Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a wireless earbuds. It didn't announce any Nest products, but during a segment of the show, we might have gotten a glimpse of a new Nest smart speaker. That's a big deal, because Google hasn't released a Nest speaker in 5 years. The device looks like a squashed HomePod Mini, with a ring of LEDs on the underside that light up when Gemini speaks.

That's the other component—Gemini is coming to Google Home. It's finally replacing Google Assistant, and that means you'll be able to interact with the assistant much more naturally and control all of your smart home devices without having to say rigid commands. That includes Gemini Live for a much faster back-and-forth conversation with the assistant. Google's blog post says early access to Gemini for Home will begin in October, and it will replace Assistant on existing speakers and displays “over time.” That might suggest a new Nest Speaker will kick off the new capabilities.

Last week, we reported that Apple had “redesigned” its blood oxygen sensing tool to get around a patent infringement suit brought by Masimo, and that blood oxygen sensing had returned to the Apple Watch Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2. On Wednesday, August 20, Masimo sued US Customs and Border Protection, saying that CBP had unlawfully allowed Apple to reactivate the feature, as reported by Bloomberg Law.

In the complaint, Masimo notes that CBP had reversed the ruling in an ex parte decision without Masimo's knowledge, in spite of the fact that the agency normally requires both parties to be heard. In addition, Masimo also noted that this reversal comes after Apple committed an additional $100 billion in US investment for a total of $600 billion, in a ceremony where Apple CEO Tim Cook presented Trump with an engraved glass disk mounted on a 24K-gold base. Masimo has asked the court for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to block CBP's ruling and to restore the January 2024 decision to sell the watches only if the sensing has been disabled. For the time being, your Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2 have blood oxygen sensing; we will soon see whether this year's Watch 11 will have it as well. —Adrienne So

Insta360 has announced the Go Ultra, a new action camera in the company's tiny Go series. Like its predecessor, the Go 3S, the Go Ultra consists of a body and a detachable camera pod. Unlike the pill-shaped detachable element of previous Go cameras, the Go Ultra pod is square. It's still light (58 grams) and the built-in magnetic back means it can mount in places other cameras can't.

The big news in the Go Ultra is the new 1/1.28-inch sensor, which is more the double the size of the sensor in the Go 3S. I've been testing a pre-release model of the Go Ultra all summer, and the new sensor is impressive. Video now tops out a 4K 60p (up from 4K 30p), but the details are much sharper with less blurring in motion shots. Other nice upgrades include a microSD card slot and a more powerful battery that lasts almost an hour shooting 4K. We'll have a full review next week. The Insta360 Go Ultra is available today for $450. —Scott Gilbertson

Earlier this year, I noted that no other fitness tracker I've tested has generated as much interest as a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which tracks what you eat by measuring glucose in your interstitial fluid via a small filament that goes under your skin on an always-on sensor. This week, Signos has launched the first third-party, FDA-cleared system that incorporates the Dexcom Stelo sensor with an AI-powered app that lets users see in granular detail how food, exercise, sleep, and activity level affect their metabolic health.

The interest in continuous glucose monitoring is concurrent with the interest in the class of drugs called GLP-1s, which include Ozempic and Wegovy and work by mimicking a hormone in the body that regulates blood sugar. Like CGMs, GLP-1s were first sold as tools for diabetes treatment but are now used widely for weight loss. When I tested a continuous glucose monitor, I found it extremely stressful to monitor my food intake at this level of detail, but I think that anyone who wants this information should be able to get it. Now you can, along with an increased level of detail and personalized, actionable recommendations. —Adrienne So

On a bike, a power meter measures how hard you're pedaling and is generally considered the most accurate measurement of how hard you're working. It a necessary accessory if you are training to be better at cycling. Most power meters are expensive, large, and attach to your crankset or pedals, but this week, BikeOn launched a tiny, affordable power meter that purports to measure your power output via a palm-sized clip that attaches near your front derailleur. The device has guides and gears that your chain passes through, which is how it measures activity. It requires no tools, will connect via Bluetooth to your phone, and will provide you with metrics like power output, cadence, torque, and balance measurements.

BikeOn claims that CycleClick will work via sensors that can judge changes in chain tension and speed. If this is accurate—and that is a big if, since chains, you know, get broken or dirty all the time—the CycleClick could open a whole new world of cycling metrics for bike enthusiasts who want to get better and fitter but just don't have the cash for a specialized power meter. There's nothing else on the market that looks quite like this, and we are excited to test it. —Adrienne So

Ricoh GR IV

We've got more details on Ricoh's GR IV pocket camera, the successor to the GR III, which is one of the best pocket cameras I've ever tested. While there is no built-in flash, Ricoh has announced a tiny external flash unit, the GF-2, for those who want the additional versatility. The less exciting news is the price. The GR IV will be available in mid-September for $1,499, which is a significant jump from the GR III, which was $899 when it launched. —Scott Gilbertson

This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Air conditioners have been working overtime this hot summer, from those tiny window units to the massive AC towers that serve the tightly packed apartment buildings in major cities. And while they bring the relief of cool air, these contraptions also create the conditions for dangerous bacteria to multiply and spread.

One particularly nasty bacteria-borne illness is currently spreading in New York City using those enormous cooling units as its vector: Legionnaire's disease. The bacterial pneumonia, which usually recurs each summer in the US's largest city, has sickened more than 100 people and killed five in a growing outbreak.

If you don't live in New York City or the Northeast, you may never have heard of Legionnaire's, but this niche public health threat may not be niche for much longer.

Climate change is helping to make Legionnaire's disease both more plentiful in the places where it already exists and creating the potential for it to move to new places where the population may not be accustomed to it. Cities in the Northeast and Midwest, where hotter weather meets older infrastructure, have reported more cases in recent years. Recently, Legionella bacteria was discovered in a nursing home's water system in Dearborn, Michigan—one of the states, along with Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Wisconsin, that have seen more activity in the past few years.

Anyone can contract Legionnaire's disease by inhaling tiny drops containing the bacteria, and the symptoms—fever, headache, shortness of breath—appear within days. It can cause a severe lung infection, with a death rate of around 10 percent.

While healthier people often experience few symptoms, the more vulnerable—young children, the elderly, pregnant people, and those with compromised immune systems—face serious danger from the illness. Around 5,000 people die every year in the United States from Legionnaire's disease, many of them living in low-income housing with outdated cooling equipment where the bacteria can more readily grow and spread.

Legionnaire's disease is a microcosm of climate change's impact on low-income communities. As warmer temperatures facilitate the spread of disease, the most socially vulnerable populations are going to pay the steepest price.

Legionnaire's disease was first documented after an unusually aggressive pneumonia outbreak during an American Legion conference in Philadelphia in 1976. Soon, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists confirmed the cause of the mysterious illness: a previously unknown bacteria that was accordingly named Legionella. Legionella, unfortunately, is everywhere—in streams, lakes, and water pipes across the country.

But usually, it occurs in such low concentrations and is so remote that it doesn't pose a threat to humans. Usually.

Now, city health officials have found the bacteria in the large cooling tanks that serve massive apartment buildings across New York City, particularly in Harlem. Cooling tanks are ideal places for Legionnaire's to grow and spread. They're filled with stagnant, warm water that is more hospitable to bacterial growth. Like an evaporative cooler, the systems convert warm stagnant water into cool air for apartment dwellers. They can spray mists laden with the bacteria into the open air, dispersing it across the surrounding air, where it can enter a person's lungs when they inhale. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 80 percent of Legionnaire's cases are linked to potable water systems.

Summers have always been prime time for the spread of Legionnaire's, and climate change only exacerbates all of these problems. For starters, the quality of natural water is degrading—creating more favorable conditions for Legionella, which loves acidic water and low oxygen levels, to multiply—as the planet warms. In the summer, the higher the temperatures and the more humid the air, the easier it is for the bacteria to reproduce in these cooling systems.

A decade ago, researchers warned that “climate change might increase the incidence of legionellosis through increased reliance on air-conditioning systems,” especially the large units serving city housing buildings. The European Climate and Health Observatory advised in 2022 that higher temperatures and the increased rainfall associated with climate change could soon make Legionnaire's disease a more widespread issue.

The EPA also expects the bacteria's range to expand as global temperatures rise. Each heat wave and heavy rainstorm creates the hot and wet conditions that allow Legionella to thrive. Flooding can allow Legionella-tainted water to more easily penetrate a community's water system, too.

And those who live in a low-income area are more likely to be at risk from this increased prevalence of Legionnaire's disease. As The New York Times reported recently, poorly maintained cooling systems are more likely to see Legionella flourish and pump the bacteria into their neighborhoods—and low-income housing is more likely to be poorly maintained. Though NYC attempted to require more inspections for defective cooling systems after a 2015 outbreak of Legionnaire's, inspections have fallen off in recent years, according to reporting from The Gothamist.

This dynamic isn't unique to Legionnaire's disease. As the EPA has observed, low-income people are more likely to face health consequences from climate change because they are more likely to live in places exposed to extreme weather, they are more likely to have health conditions that make them more vulnerable to infectious diseases and natural disasters—and they are more likely to live with the kind of aging infrastructure that allows Legionnaire's to flourish.

Legionnaire's is a particularly disconcerting health threat: It rains down from the sky in tiny invisible droplets, packed with bacteria so potent it can kill one in 10 people whom it manages to infect through its telltale aggressive pneumonia. It is as deadly as tuberculosis, though Legionnaire's disease usually kills much faster.

I asked some experts what people can do about Legionnaire's disease. The most important advice was to be vigilant about any public health warnings if you reside in an area where Legionella has historically lived or has recently been detected, especially if you have certain preexisting conditions like diabetes, chronic lung disease, or autoimmune disorders, or if you're over the age of 50. Follow the news and make sure you're registered for alerts from your local public health officials.

People could consider investing in a high-quality water filter during an outbreak, the CDC says. If you use an evaporative cooler or your home is equipped with a swamp cooler, you can make sure you're keeping them clean and using filtered water, if possible.

But the issue here is ultimately not your small humidifier. The problem resides much further up the water supply chain, in the massive community water systems where Legionella flourish. You can't suddenly stop drinking water or breathing air, of course, even if there is a local outbreak. The CDC itself notes that point-of-use water filters only provide limited protection.

So, whenever you know Legionnaire's disease is spreading nearby, you should be paying attention to your body, said Janet Stout, president and director of the Special Pathogens Laboratory, who has studied the disease for 30 years. See your doctor immediately if you're experiencing fever, shortness of breath, or a cough. You could have a special test done for Legionnaire's disease and potentially receive antibiotics, such as levofloxacin or azithromycin, that have proven effective against the bacteria. Most cases can be cured if they are caught early enough.

But this is a truly public health challenge; when bacteria are multiplying in community water systems and then spewing into the open air, anyone can be exposed. There is only so much that any one person's own, individual effort can do to stop infections.

The main way to prevent Legionnaire's disease, however, or at least significantly reduce its risk is by staying on top of maintenance to make sure community water sources are kept clean, preventing the bacteria from proliferating. But that kind of maintenance requires vigilance and perhaps even public pressure. In New York City, for example, only 1,200 cooling towers were inspected in the first six months of 2025, a steep drop-off from 2017, when the city checked more than 5,000 over the same period.

Landlords and public health authorities must take Legionnaire's disease seriously. We are going to see more and more outbreaks as climate change continues to heat the planet.

I'm embarrassed to admit this in my mid-forties, but I've never understood chess well enough to play a full game.

My son and daughter both learned how to play in elementary school. I was glad they had that experience. I tried to pick up the game when they did, but, as a busy mom of three little kids, I just didn't have the time, the interest, or the stamina to really sit down and learn.

Chess became more popular during the pandemic, and the boom has stuck around; according to a recent Yougov.com survey, around 21 percent of people in the US play chess occasionally, and the game is “more popular among younger adults, men, and college graduates than it is among older Americans, women, and adults without college degrees.”

I hadn't thought to give chess another try; that is, until late this past spring, when my 11-year-old son excitedly held up his phone to show me a new icon in his Duolingo app. “Look, Mom! Duolingo has a chess program now!” I smiled.

I've been a fan of Duolingo for over three years, since I first learned I could play a few games a day and advance my high school-level Spanish. I now have a 1,300-day streak, the longest in my household, and I can't help but feel proud when my children brag about it to their friends. I learned enough Spanish that I felt comfortable navigating our family through Barcelona on a recent vacation.

So, of course I opened Duolingo to see what its chess program was about.

From the start, it was easy to follow. I clicked on a piece, and dots appeared on the chessboard, indicating the valid moves. The game is hosted by Duolingo's generously mustachioed character Oscar, and within a few days of following his instructions, I understood how each piece was able to move around the board.

As I progressed through the different levels, I learned more rules, such as how to accumulate points and how to capture an opponent's piece. I was surprised how easily I understood the lessons when I had previously had difficulty understanding the game. I was also able to consider both sides of the board to play offense as well as defense—something I had never been able to do before.

I was curious about the intentions behind the program and how it was so quickly teaching me a game that has been on my bucket list since I was a little girl, so I reached out to the chess team at Duolingo.

They explained that the goal for the chess program is to attract people like me who always had an interest in chess but, for one reason or another, never fully committed.

Jake Fishman, founder of Mindful Chess, agrees that the app is good for beginners. “It introduces chess in a fun, accessible manner for beginners, particularly younger players, who are already used to the Duolingo model of gamified learning,” Fishman says. “The bite-sized lessons, rewards, and streaks lessen the intimidation factor of the game and present it more like an enjoyable language-learning experience.”

The game is filling a hole for this type of instruction; there aren't many programs that teach basic chess. “Many of the products that were on the market catered to someone who knew chess already, and we really saw an opportunity to bring it more to the masses,” says Edwin Bodge, group product manager on Duolingo's chess team.

Another appeal for creating the chess program is that chess takes a long time to master, which benefits the folks at Duolingo who are building a long-term business but also the user, who is working toward a long-term goal that takes patience and thought.

To create the game, Duolingo hired people with a range of experiences to work on the format. For example, when Bodge joined the team, he says he knew how the pieces moved and that's about it. The company also has someone on staff who takes his son to chess tournaments every weekend.

The program is also suitable for individuals at an intermediate level. “If you have previous chess experience, you can test into a later part of the course,” he says. “But for the most part, we've really gone after making chess much more accessible for people who either don't know about it or just barely do.”

Fishman agrees. While the Duolingo app “is great for generating interest and embedding the fundamentals of chess, it does not replace structured learning or the richness of learning with a teacher,” he says. “ An app can highlight rules and simple tactics, but it also does not have the personalized feedback and motivation that comes from a coach.”

While I would love to consider getting more serious about chess in the future, for now the app has me playing chess every day. First I play a few lessons and am surprised how quickly I'm moving through the levels. Then I play a few matches. It's a nice break from scrolling social media, and it keeps my mind busy when I'm in a car pickup line waiting for the kids. Unlike the language-learning modules, I don't have to read or write. I can just focus on the pieces.

Oscar is a sore loser when I take his queen, and it's fun watching him get frustrated. He's clearly programmed to be a good competitor, and he never just lets me win. The program knows my familiarity with the game and how to challenge me without overwhelming me.

“When you're first starting out, Oscar will go pretty easy on you,” says Sammi Siegel, staff software engineer on the chess team at Duolingo. “In the beginning, you need an easier experience and more hints. As you win, the program will scale you up in difficulty, so you'll get slightly harder and harder bots, and then, if you lose, we'll scale you back to be easier as well.”

Aside from keeping my Duolingo streak going and working through the chess levels, my personal goal is to increase my Elo score, a global ranking system used to compare chess players. It helps me understand where I stand compared to more seasoned players or if I decide to play on another online platform or in real life.

“The program is trying to calibrate where you're at and push you to a higher Elo rating once you're ready for it,” says Siegel. A level of 1,500 is considered intermediate, and that's where Duolingo's game ends. I'm hovering around 600 but gaining ground every day.

My kids have also started playing chess on the app, and we have fun sending screenshots of each other's Elo scores. The one downside is that the program doesn't have an option to play within the app against my children or a friend; I can only play against Oscar. Bodge acknowledges that the option to compete against other players or friends is a common request and says it's on the team's radar.

For now, I'm playing as much as I can and learning new strategies every day. That little girl from the '80s who never found a way to pick up chess is proud she's finally getting the hang of it. I want to show my kids that you can always learn a new skill, even when life gets busy. I'd also like to beat them at a few games.

Lenovo is currently the biggest PC and laptop company in the world, and they just so happen to make some of our favorite laptops and PC peripherals. In fact, our list of the Best Laptops you can buy include a number of Lenovo devices that we've tested and fully recommend, ranging from high-end premium laptops to options for budget-minded shoppers. If you are looking to save a few bucks while shopping for a new Lenovo product, here are the Lenovo coupon codes and special offers you need to know about.

Back to school season is a great time to shop for a laptop, and there are already tons of deals across Lenovo's portfolio of Chromebooks and Windows laptops to search through. We're a big fan of some of Lenovo's Chromebooks, in particular, which do a good job straddling the line between price and quality. The Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 for example, is currently our pick for the Best Chromebook you can buy and is easily the best Chromebook I've ever made. Meanwhile, the Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus is a close second, finding a great price around the $500 mark.

If you are shopping for the upcoming return to school, right now it's the last call to save an extra $100 off for PCs, tablets, and peripherals. You'll get the extra savings on all orders that are over $500. The deal ends on August 24 though, so now's your chance to save some extra cash.

Beyond the back to school deal, Lenovo has a number of other current offers available when shopping through Lenovo.com. There are weekly deals on PCs and tech that include free shipping with no minimums. For certain products, you can even choose to buy online and pick it up in-store at Best Buy. If you're looking for more Lenovo recommendations, we're big fans of the Lenovo Idea Tab Pro, an Android tablet that's currently on our Best Tablets list. It's currently discounted by 26%, bringing the price down to $280.

Lenovo is also offering price-matching on any comparable PC, including from many online retailers. That's really helpful, as it's not uncommon to see price discrepancies between different retailers.

Lenovo does offer a fairly generous discount program for certain demographics as well. These include a 5% off Education, Healthcare, First Responder, and Senior (over 55) discount.

You can use this discount on anything you find at Lenovo.com, which includes a lot more than just Lenovo-branded laptops. For example, Lenovo sells one of our favorite laptop docking stations, the Kensington Triple Video Mobile Dock. Despite its tiny size, this tiny device can power up to three 1080p (or two 4K) displays simultaneously. It's a great example of the wide diversity of products you can use these discounts and coupon codes on.

Lenovo has a My Lenovo Rewards system that can earn you points that can be spent on future purchases from Lenovo.com. Almost everything you buy gets you between 3% and 9% back in the form of reward points, and you can start redeeming points right after signing up for an account. 1,000 points is equal to $1 that you can spend on future purchases.

There's also Lenovo's Gear Up Sweepstakes that's currently running for My Lenovo Rewards members. You can enter to win a Legion 5 Gen 10 gaming laptop, a Bluetooth Mouse, a backpack, and true wireless earbuds. The sweepstakes will end on August 24.

Lenovo uses Katapult to offer financing and lease-to-own options on its laptops. That might be useful if you've been eyeing one of Lenovo's higher-end laptops. One of our favorite of these is the Lenovo Yoga 9i, a gorgeous 2-in-1 with a bright OLED screen and a luxurious design. This laptop is currently listed as one of our top recommendations for the Best Laptops and Best 2-in-1 Laptop.

Katapult allows you to buy now and pay over time, without charging late fees. If you put down a $45 initial payment, you can check out the laptop today. Katapult offers up to $3,500 in pre-approved leases and allows you to make minimum payments over time or buyout early.

Labor Day is not until September 1, but retailers are already offering oodles of Labor Day deals. The unofficial end of summer, a celebration of the American worker's contribution to our national prosperity, brings with it bargains on WIRED-tested gear, including home office essentials and some of our favorite gadgets. For the next couple of weeks, we'll be cruising and perusing for the latest true discounts on the gear we recommend to our friends—and rounding them all up for you below.

Check our Best Labor Day Mattress Deals and upcoming outdoor gear deals stories for additional savings. We've also got some updated roundups for Back to School Deals and Back to School Laptop Deals.

Updated August 23: We've added five new deals from Lectric, Ettitude, Joybird, Citizenry, and Plunge. We've also ensured pricing throughout and removed expired deals.

The Sony Bravia 7 II has been on sale for this price for a little while, but we have yet to see it drop lower. It's in our Best TVs buying guide as the pick with the most immersive picture. It has natural yet vivid colors and excellent picture processing. Reviewer Ryan Waniata says it renders 4K and HD scenes “so clearly you'll feel like they're going to spill into your living room.” It could have better black levels and a few more ports, but it's still an excellent set, especially at this price.

Our favorite electric scooter, the Apollo Go, manages to strike an excellent balance between features and price. It weighs 46 pounds and has maximum speeds of 28 miles per hour, though you can tweak top speed, brake strength, and acceleration response in the app. It also has a few extra features like turn signals, a bell, and self-healing tires. We haven't seen it sell for less.

The XPress 750 is our favorite ebike for folks on a budget. The frame is comfortable and the pedaling feels natural, so it feels more like a classic bike and less like a lean, mean electric machine. The range could be better, but you'll have no trouble zooming around your neighborhood at top speeds of 28 mph. And the LCD display and controls are simple and easy to use, so this is an especially great bike for beginners.

This is the best price we've seen thus far for our favorite Android tablet. It's not a high-performance powerhouse, but it can handle the tasks that most people need. You can watch videos (even outdoors in bright sunlight), play most games, and use the included stylus to take notes or efficiently browse the web. The battery lasts about 20 hours and only takes about 100 minutes to recharge.

The Apple iPad (A16, 2025) is the iPad we recommend for most people. It comes in fun colors like blue and yellow, and it's plenty powerful to handle whatever you'll throw at it on a day-to-day basis—from playing games to streaming videos to browsing the web. It doesn't support Apple Intelligence, which may be a blessing or a curse depending on whom you ask. It does have a modern bezel design around its 11-inch LCD screen, plus USB-C charging, a Touch ID sensor, and two 12-megapixel cameras—one in the back and one for selfies. It also works with many of the best iPad accessories.

The M4 Apple MacBook Air is the best MacBook for most people. This is the cheapest we've seen it. Where some MacBooks are overkill for basic everyday tasks, this lightweight model can handle them with ease—and you won't be paying for performance that you won't use. It has a bright display, long battery life, and support for up to two external displays as well as Apple Intelligence. And while you might want something else if you'll be doing heavy video editing or need a giant screen, the M4 MacBook Air will be capable of handling multiple Google Chrome tabs and apps running in the background. We do wish it had some more ports, but you can always use a USB hub to customize them further.

These are the best noise-canceling earbuds we've tried. They have excellent sound quality and battery life, plus solid control options, and they're comfortable to wear for long periods of time. But where they truly excel is in active noise canceling. They can make a busy subway car or crowded airplane disappear entirely, lending you extra focus or decompression with no effort.

Branch has made our favorite office chair for years. It has oodles of adjustable elements, including the arms, armrests, seat depth, recline, lumbar support, and seat tilt. The foam cushion seat is comfortable and the mesh backrest is supportive, too. The affordable price tag is icing on the cake, and while it doesn't go on sale very often, you can save 10 percent until the sale ends with code LABORDAY.

If you don't want to spring for the Ergonomic Chair Pro, this is the best budget-friendly office chair and an option worth considering. It's very easy to assemble. and there are a few adjustable areas for a better fit—the armrests, seat, recline, and lumbar support can all be dialed in. There are some fun fabric color options, like blue and orange, though the upholstery does tend to pill and is a magnet for pet hair. Even with its quirks, it will be a definite upgrade if you're still working from the ratty chair you picked up off Craigslist when you first built your home office.

Sitting all day is bad for you! This telescoping desk can be raised up as high as 45 inches, with simple setup and two available sizes. It comes in a few different finishes. The leg motors aren't the quietest, but they work well, and the desk looks great in any setup. For additional recommendations, check our home office buying guide.

This coupon code gets you 20 percent off almost everything on Humanscale's website. Humanscale makes some of the best office chairs. The Freedom Headrest is the best reclining office chair, and it drops from $1,743 to $1,394 with code SEMIANNUAL20. Editor Julian Chokkattu said, “This chair gracefully supports my back like a mother gently laying a baby in a crib.” We also like the Humanscale Path, which is great for tight spaces and even comes in armless versions. It falls from $1,294 to $1,035 after code.

The Silk & Snow S&S Organic Mattress is our favorite organic latex mattress. The latex-wrapped coils help to alleviate any tension or pressure points while you're sleeping, and it's especially great for side sleepers. You can also get two pillows or a sheet set for free with your purchase. Check our roundup of Labor Day Mattress Deals for additional expert recommendations.

This is the bed frame I'm currently using, and I love it very much. Assembly wasn't my favorite, but once I got it all put together, I fell in love. It has a drawer at the foot of the bed that's handy for storing extra linens or off-season clothing, and it's sturdy too. I also appreciate that the platform lets me maneuver my mattress easily so I don't have to fight to change my sheets.

This well-made, luxurious sofa is one of the best couches you can buy online. Operations manager Scott Gilbertson called it the best-looking and most comfortable couch he's ever sat on. The website lets you order swatches and pick the layout you want, and you can even get a full-size printout to make sure the couch will look right in your living space. There are dozens of options for upholstery, legs, and cushion fill, so you can create the couch of your dreams. For a more affordable option, we also like the Benchmade Modern Laguna (pictured above) on sale for $2,397 ($599 off). “My family and I have been sitting on it for a year and a half now, and the single cushion (as well as the rest of the couch's cushions) is comfortable and supportive,” says reviewer Nena Farrell.

Breeo makes the best upgrade firepit. The American-made pit has a fire bowl that's 2 feet wide, so it'll fit pre-cut wood, and there are a ton of accessories available. (We especially like the live-fire pizza oven, on sale for $723—a $128 discount). The hefty, sturdy base and natural patina (on the Corten steel option) make this a centerpiece worthy of any backyard.

This is featured in our guide to the Best Kitchen Composters. It has the fastest compost breakdown of any model we tried. It has some quirks, like a lid that requires two hands to open and the machine's tendency to make a loud whirring noise as it works. But it's a great entry-level kitchen composter, and it doesn't drop in price very often.

The Ooni Volt is the very best electric pizza oven. It can heat up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit, and the triple-pane glass door always lets you see what's going on. And while you might miss out on some of the vibes that come with a fire-powered oven, the Volt can safely be used indoors and outdoors—so you won't have to brave the coming winter chill (or supply propane refills) to get your paws on some good 'za.

Hydroviv makes one of the best shower water filters we've tested. The bacteriostatic showerhead was able to filter total chlorine down to undetectable levels in reviewer Matthew Korfhage's chloramine-treated water. This deal is for the automatically replenishing subscription bundle. Hydroviv says you should replace filters every six months, but you can pause or cancel that subscription if you decide you want to order them separately.

WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu tested and loved this outdoor couch and armchair set. The couches come with OuterShell, which is a built-in cover that helps protect the couch cushions from the elements (and stray bird poops). The performance fabric is made from recyclable materials, and the covers are machine washable. Julian still has to see how the couch fares New York winters, but so far, it's sturdy and comfortable. We like that the couch is made with Forest Stewardship Council-certified wood. It's also backed by a 10-year warranty and available in four different fabric options.

We've recommended the Albany Park Barton in our couch buying guide for years. It's soft and supportive, with deep seats and wide arms so you can put down your coffee cup or phone without needing an extra table. There are many different fabrics to choose from, and you can choose the stain of the wooden legs too. Assembly wasn't too difficult—just be prepared to take out a lot of recycling afterward. The couch also comes with a 30-day trial so you can try it before committing.

Home Depot is offering up to 35 percent off a variety of appliances for Labor Day, including washing machines, dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers, and various bundles. This discount also applies to a few robot vacuums that we like from Roborock and iRobot, as well as a large selection of window air conditioners we recommend.

Intel officially announced an agreement with President Donald Trump's administration on Friday afternoon, following Trump's statement that the government would be taking a 10% stake in the struggling chipmaker.

While Intel says the government is making an “$8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock,” the administration does not appear to be committing new funds. Instead, it's simply making good on what Intel described as “grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel.”

Specifically, the $8.9 billion is supposed to come from $5.7 billion awarded-but-not-paid to Intel under the Biden administration's CHIPS Act, as well as $3.2 billion also awarded by the Biden administration through the Secure Enclave program.

In a post on his social network Truth Social, Trump wrote, “The United States paid nothing for these shares.” Nonetheless, he described this as “a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.”

Trump has been critical of the CHIPS Act, calling it a “horrible, horrible thing” and calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to “get rid” of it. In a regulatory filing in June, Intel said that while it had already received $2.2 billion in CHIPS Act funding, it had subsequently requested an additional $850 million in reimbursement that the government had not yet paid.

According to The New York Times, some bankers and lawyers believe the CHIPS Act may not allow the government to convert its grants to equity, opening this deal to potential legal challenges.

In addition to his targeting of the CHIPS Act, earlier this month Trump also accused Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan of conflicts of interests and said he should “resign immediately.” The president was more positive about Tan on Friday, saying on Truth Social that he “negotiated this deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company.”

For his part, Tan said in a statement that the company is “grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.”

Intel's announcement also says the government's investment will be “passive,” with no board seats or other governance and information rights.

Hey YC! We're Jonathan and Jeffrey.

tl;dr We've built the best computer use foundation models in the world.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGht355DYzY







Today's foundation models are great at generating text, but they can't reliably act. We're building foundation models that can use computers, using human behavior data rather than text. In two months, we've beaten OpenAI's GPT-5, o3, and Anthropic's Claude 4 Sonnet computer use at OSWorld, an industry standard computer-use benchmark.



Our model also has 16x lower latency to action at better performance and lower compute spend:



Examples of the model in action at https://inductionlabs.com/news/axiom-1!

Our ask

The field of computer use is still in its early days, and one of the biggest gaps is rigorous, real-world evaluation. We want to partner with teams building computer use agents to train models and create benchmarks that reflect real workflows, and we're willing to fund these efforts.

Reach out at founders@inductionlabs.com if you want to work with us to build the next benchmark for your use case!

The team

Jeffrey and Jonathan were the owners of Cohere's reinforcement learning infrastructure, unlocking RL for Cohere's reasoning models. They touched the entire training stack, improving long context performance, reasoning post-training, and model inference.

At 17, Jonathan joined Cohere as the youngest member of the modeling organization, where he was promoted two levels to a full-time role within his first six months. In high-school, he published machine learning research to top-tier NLP venues such as ACL and EMNLP. Jeffrey built reasoning models at Cohere for two years. His natural habitat is in mathematics research, where he worked on Lie Algebras at the University of Ottawa.

How much do you value quiet? I'm not trying to get profound here—this is a gadget review, not a self-help seminar—but it's a question worth asking. Personally, I find quiet to be pretty important. Nothing says loving myself like putting on a pair of earbuds and telling the entirety of New York City to kindly, f**k off. And for that peace of mind, you have a lot of earbuds at your disposal. Any pair worth its weight in plastic will have the option for ANC nowadays. But just because they all have it doesn't mean every pair of ANC buds is created equal. To the contrary, my friends, there are levels to this shit.

If you're like Bose and you put “quiet” in the name of your earbuds, one should expect a high degree of noise cancellation—even more so for a gen-2 product. And folks, I'm here to tell you (not quietly) that's exactly what the $299 Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd gen) bring to the table.

I tested these puppies in some of the worst conditions you can imagine (the chaotic NYC subway), and I can say, without a doubt, if I want to block the maximum amount of noise with earbuds, these will be the ones I reach for. Bose doesn't provide exact dB numbers on how much cancellation its newest QuietComfort Ultra earbuds block out, but anecdotally it feels like a lot.

Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2

Bose's second-gen QuietComfort Ultra 2 earbuds still have class-leading ANC.

Pros

Cons

On the subway, I felt extremely insulated from train noise and voices, which is incredible if you're trying to zone out on your commute to work or avoid any unwanted conversations. I also tested them at a busy coffee shop with lots of chatter and music playing, and they blocked out all of that racket adeptly when I started playing music.

Even when I wasn't playing music, just sitting with the earbuds in my ears, it silenced most of the ambient noise. These might be the only earbuds I want on my next flight. Bose says it went back to the lab and adjusted its ActiveSense technology, which enables adaptive ANC in the QuietComfort Ultra 2 to make transitions in noise-cancellation levels “smoother.”

While I haven't had a chance to use the QuietComfort Ultra gen-1, I can say that I didn't find the second-gen version to be choppy in their ANC adjustments when I had adaptive ANC activated.

If you actually do want to hear something, the QuietComfort Ultra 2 also have excellent transparency. By tapping and holding the side of the right earbud, you can switch from “Quiet” to “Aware” mode, which turns off ANC and allows you to hear your surroundings.

I wouldn't normally do this, for politeness' sake, but I tested Bose's second-gen QuietComfort Ultra buds' transparency mode by having some conversations with them in, including an exchange at a pharmacy. Even with my ears plugged up, I didn't miss a beat. I still hate having my ears blocked when I talk to people, since I can hear my voice reverberate in my own head (yuck), but if you need to have a conversation quickly and don't want to pop the buds out, you can at least hear other people easily.

Another highlight you might notice while switching between modes is that the touch controls on the outside of the buds are very sensitive. That might be annoying in some cases, like if you accidentally brush your bud while fixing your hair or taking off a hat, but I actually think this is a perk.

I've used a lot of underwhelming touch controls in my day, and these are not among them. Personally, I'd rather have touch controls be oversensitive than under. I'd prefer to have a few accidental miscues than have to aggressively tap on the buds to get them to do what I want. The good news is, if you disagree, you can now turn off the touch controls completely in the Bose app to avoid the miscues altogether.

Sound-wise, the QuietComfort Ultra hold their own. It was hard switching between the QuietComfort Ultra 2 and the Technics EAH-AZ100 that I happened to be testing at the same time, since the latter are some of the best-sounding earbuds I've ever used, but I still think these earbuds will appease most sound-wise. I listened to the same record that I used for testing the aforementioned Technics buds (Geese's “3D Country”), and while they didn't have the same dynamic range or clarity as the Technics, they kept pace with other “Pro” earbuds I've used in the past, like Google's Pixel Buds Pro.

Mids and highs were represented satisfactorily. I would say they even manage to push the envelope in the bass department, which was a lot bassier, for lack of a better word, than I was expecting. If you don't like the out-of-the-box tuning, you can switch things up in the Bose app with custom and preset EQ.

One thing that may be divisive among the general public is the look of the buds. They're chunky, I'm not going to lie, but I like the design, especially in the white color that I got the buds in, which reminds me of a muted PlayStation 1.

Despite how big the buds are, I didn't find the weight to be annoying, and Bose did a good job with balancing the size with making them look sleek, mixing the matte-ish plastic of the case with a shiny, smooth plastic on the buds. There's a smooth metal strip along the stem with some Bose branding. Just like the SoundLink Plus, Bose's newest Bluetooth speaker that I also recently tested, I find the QuietComfort Ultra 2 to be an appealing blend of minimalism and creativity.

Feature-wise, these buds are stacked. If you want 3D audio, you can switch the buds to “Immersion” mode which which tracks audio to your head movements, there's an ear tip fit test in the Bose app, custom EQ, and one cool feature in this generation is that you can now see the case's battery levels in your app, so you know when you need to charge it up. I say once again, you need to stop sleeping on your earbuds' companion app—there's a lot there to love.

Speaking of battery, Bose says the QuietComfort Ultra 2 get up to 6 hours of battery with ANC on, but that figure drops (naturally) to 4 hours if you have Immersive audio activated. That case holds 24 hours of juice, so about three full charges. That's not the best battery life in the world, but it's average.

The fact is, Bose's QuietComfort Ultra 2 do one thing really well, and that's block out noise. In some cases, only having one great feature could be considered a flaw, especially for earbuds that cost $299, but ANC is one of the main reasons why people buy wireless earbuds in the first place, so Bose seems to have focused its energy in the right direction.

While these earbuds aren't giving you the same level of hi-fi sounds as some other similarly priced earbuds on the market, they reward you in dividends when your neighbor is having a raucous party, once again.

Chipotle says it's jumping on the drone delivery bandwagon. This week, the company announced a new pilot program in Texas that will test the viability of airdropping customers' orders into their backyards for them.

A press release published Thursday makes the whole process sound quite easy as far as drone-robot hybrid delivery burritos go. Certain customers in the Rowlette suburb of Dallas will be able to download the app for Zipline, Chipotle's new drone partner, and place their orders.

Then, Chipotle staff will place the food orders at locations where they can be picked up by the drones, which will then fly to customers' homes. The company says that Zipline's drones will hover “about 300 feet in the air” while a little carrier that contains the food is lowered to the ground.

The press release states that a “small number of Zipline users will have access to Zipotle starting today, ahead of a broader service launch in the coming weeks.”

We've officially unlocked burritos🌯⚡

Introducing Zipotle — all your favorites from @ChipotleTweets, now delivered faster by air pic.twitter.com/zZukZf0wV9

— Zipline (@zipline) August 21, 2025



Zipline has a very reputable track record, having made a name for itself with aerial deliveries of medical supplies in countries with poor infrastructure. Most notably, the company partnered with the Rwandan government in 2016 to deliver much-needed blood products to remote hospitals.

The company's work greatly reduced the amount of time it took to deliver life-saving materials to patients, Rwandan doctors have said. Such applications of drone technology—to provide vital materials to people who need them—seem like the exact sort of thing the autonomous delivery industry should be focused on.

On the other hand, Zipline's pivot to burrito deliveries may not be the best use of its talents.

Thursday's press release includes some humorous comments from Zipline top exec, Keller Rinaudo Cliffton. “With Zipline, you tap a button, and minutes later food magically appears – hot, fresh, and ultra-fast,” said Cliffton, CEO and Co-Founder of Zipline. “Starting today, families in the Dallas area can have food delivered by Zipotle and served for lunch or dinner. What once felt like science fiction is soon going to become totally normal.”

Okay, sure.

Of all the trendy new tech applications, my feeling is that grocery delivery via drone is easily one of the goofiest. For 90 percent of us, there is almost no foreseeable benefit to having a flying robot deliver our home goods. The only real difference is that companies don't have to hire new delivery workers, and now there are drones clogging up the aerial byways around your house.

That said, some studies claim that drone delivery can reduce carbon emissions, although it's not clear how solid the science on that is yet (for instance, a recent study found big carbon savings between drone delivery and deliveries made by diesel trucks but, then again, most burritos are not delivered by diesel trucks).

Over its currently two-season run, Star Wars: Visions has shown audiences the adventures of Force users, droids, and rebels. One viewpoint we've not seen much of is the Imperial forces, despite their repeatedly turning up in the show's various shorts—but that's changing with the new season, and things will get pretty cerebral.

During this weekend's Anime NYC, panelists got a look at “Black,” a short for the next set of episodes dropping in October. Developed by david production (Fire Force), the episode centers on an Imperial Stormtrooper on the verge of losing a battle and what's going on in their head during their final moments. According to the Star Wars description, “Black” will be something special and ” present a psychedelic battle between past and present, light and dark, and life and death.”

“Black” is directed by Shinya Ohira, who's previously directed and done animation work for One Piece and The Boy and the Heron. In a pre-recorded video, he talked about the short's “fine details,” such as “super detailed” Death Star and extending action in the battle scenes to convey the stormtrooper's “haunted psyche.” Visually, the film was also inspired by Ohira's want to put “intense battles” against the vocals of Japanese singer/songwriter Sakura Fujiawara.

Ohira went on to describe “Black” as something “nobody's ever seen before,” and an “arduous task” for the animators that he hopes is worth all the trouble. The article on the Star Wars website doesn't provide any clips or further story info, but Ohira promised the short “really speaks for itself”—and we'll see how well it talks when the third season of Star Wars: Visions hits Disney+ on October 29.

The CEO says his primary role is to ensure the new Commodore “isn't a bankrupt Commodore.”


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


New Commodore owner Peri Fractic (AKA Christian Simpson) has posted an update on the success of the company since it made it safely into the arms of its fans. In the latest video installment, Simpson shares the important news that Commodore is already thriving. Moreover, we get a look inside the factory where the new Commodore 64 Ultimate computer is being made, details about the included operating system software, and even more teasers mentioning future products with flavors of Amiga technology.

Let's talk business first. Simpson revealed that this Commodore purchase deal, eight months in the making, has been secured with the help of angel investors and following the barnstorming sales of the newly reinvigorated company's first product. The money is now in escrow, it seems.

Billed as the company's first hardware release in over 30 years, the new Commodore 64 Ultimate (and its less glamorous brethren) have been doing a roaring trade. Particularly strong take-up of the gold-hewn Founders Edition has helped boost receipts.

Simpson shared the above chart, which he says represents the first week's sales volume of the new Commodore 64 computers. What you see represents about $2 million worth of computers sold to customers. The period shown spans the first pre-order week.

Of that $2 million, about half goes toward production, said Simpson. There's also a significant portion allocated to the acquisition pot, as well as future product R&D costs. However, “Commodore now has money in the bank,” which is an important point, the new CEO emphasized.



Simpson noted that he keeps one thing in particular in focus. Commodore famously went bankrupt in 1994. Subsequently, the name went through a low point (or two), lending its branding power to lowly commodity electronics, such as paper shredders. This shouldn't be allowed to happen again, and Simpson asserts his primary role now is to make sure the new Commodore “isn't a bankrupt Commodore.”

During the latest episode from Retro Recipes, we see some of the new C64 machines being prepared in a factory. The manufacturing appears to be in the hands of, or affiliated with, PCB Way, which is based in China.

We've clipped several screenshots showing the C64 Ultimate work-in-progress components and machines. So, if you've ordered one of these computers, you might want a peek through the gallery above.

During the factory tour, we see prototype designs and quality control measures in place ahead of mass production. It is encouraging that eyes are on those niggly details, such as alignment and logos. Some scenes also feature components such as RGB components, PSUs, and more.

Simpson shows that he is busy working on the new C64 Ultimate menu system design (at approximately 8 minutes and 30 seconds). Shipping models should boot into the classic Basic prompt, it was noted. Another interesting software feature is that GEOS is now included. This is an ancient software suite that was well-suited for productivity.

Though the C64 legacy is immense, many Commodore fans are more rooted in the Amiga era. Thus, it is interesting to see more Amiga developments and products teased in the new video.

Simpson claims there have been positive meetings about Amiga products and branding. That isn't really elaborated on. However, later we see a recording of a video chat with Dave Haynie, the Chief Engineer of the Amiga 2000, 3000, and 4000 desktop computers (video, approximately 23 minutes). For some perspective, Haynie was working on the AAA chipset when the Commodore folded in 1994. That would have brought 24-bit graphics and 3D support to the platform, while retaining backwards compatibility. Invited to collaborate, Haynie said he would “love to be involved.” Some parts of the Haynie conversation were obviously deleted, which only heightened anticipation.

In the future, Simpson suggests Commodore will be a ‘Founders Sandbox' where all the alumni will be able to “brainstorm ideas and projects for potential official release.” Some of those products may (should) touch on the Amiga era. But they may also include calculators, we hear during a Simpson chat with Leonard Tramiel, who was appointed CTO – that's ‘Chief Tramiel Officer' - live in another video call that was shared.

Later in the video, you can see footage from the day the deal was signed by the new owners to secure the 47 Commodore trademarks.

This is apparently the end of the three-part series ‘Let's buy Commodore.' Simpson signed off by hinting at more modern products to come. The firm's roadmap includes three or four major releases per year for the next four years.

Let the price war begin?

Demand for high-performance server CPUs is quite high these days, both because of the AI boom and because traditional cloud service providers continue to expand their fleets. However, something unusual is happening on the retail market of data center processors in the U.S., as the latest EPYC 9005-series CPUs from AMD and Xeon 6 Performance-series CPUs from Intel are available with discounts of around 50%. We have inquired with both AMD and Intel about why their latest CPUs are available below list prices at retailers in the U.S. and are awaiting their response.

Neither AMD nor Intel recently announced price cuts for their server offerings, but as we discovered today, virtually all high-end EPYC and Xeon CPUs — including the latest generation and previous generation SKUs — are now being sold well below their prices for direct customers at retail.

If server processors from AMD and Intel were available below their list prices at a small retailer with no reputation, we would suspect the listings were merely fraud. However, two respected retailers — ShopBLT and Newegg — offer the latest EPYC and Xeon CPUs at steep discounts from their pricing guidelines, which means that these products can indeed be obtained relatively cheaply, or rather below their list prices (1000-unit prices for AMD, recommended customer price in case of Intel). 

Flagship server CPUs from AMD and Intel are quite expensive: the 192-core EPYC 9965 costs $14,813, and the 128-core Xeon 6980P is priced at $12,460 (after Intel had already slashed its price from $17,800 in early January) when purchased in 1000-unit quantities by its direct customers. 

However, ShopBLT is selling both processors with 35% and 53% discounts for $9,713 and $5,836, respectively. 

ShopBLT is not alone, as Newegg offers Intel's Xeon 6980P for $6,190, a 50% reduction from Intel's recommended customer pricing (RCP). 

AMD's top-of-the-line 192-core EPYC 9965 processor is officially priced at $14,813 when sold in batches of 1,000 units. However, ShopBLT offers it for $9,713 (about 35% below the official 1kU pricing) with an ETA of 15 days. A slightly less powerful 160-core EPYC 9845 is sold for $13,564 in 1kU quantities by AMD, but ShopBLT sells it for $8,896, a 35% reduction from AMD's 1kU pricing.

A more mainstream 72-core EPYC 9565 can be obtained for $5,728, down 45% from the official price for direct customers. AMD's previous-generation Zen 4-based EPYC 9004-series CPUs are also sold well below their recommended prices for direct clients.

Intel's Xeon 6 6900P-series CPUs are sold at even steeper discounts from their RCPs. The flagship 128-core Xeon 6980P is available for $5,166 (53% lower than RCP), the 96-core Xeon 6972P is priced at $4,789 (53% lower than RCP), whereas the Xeon 6960P can be purchased for $4,511 (53% off from the RCP). The previous-generation flagship — the 64-core Xeon 8592+ — is priced at 'affordable' $2,280, which is five times less than its list price.

AMD's 1kU prices and Intel's RCPs are prices for their direct customers buying in batches of 1,000 units. In general, these are benchmarks, not fixed retail prices. Real-world prices depend on many factors, including negotiated contracts, order sizes, and distributor channel incentives, among other things, so it's quite common for large cloud service providers (CSPs) or OEMs to get their CPUs below list prices.

Retail is another matter, though. For now, we could see two possible reasons why brand-new server CPUs are available below their list prices. 

Intel and AMD are in fierce competition for data center market share, which may drive prices well below official RCPs. Intel had to slash Xeon 6 pricing to stay relevant against AMD's higher-core-count EPYC 9005 CPUs earlier this year, while AMD discounts to prevent hyperscalers and enterprises from defaulting to Intel, which still dominates server chip sales. This head-to-head pressure could force distributors and retailers to undercut list prices, making high-end CPUs far cheaper in the open market. 

Also, both AMD and Intel are producing CPUs aggressively to secure market share in data centers. If supply briefly overshot immediate OEM demand, distributors may be offloading excess stock into retail channels, and to move volume, they could be discounting well below list prices.

Will the U.S. finally allow Nvidia to export its follow-up to the hit H20 chip?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Reports suggest that Nvidia has already presented a B30 chip to the U.S. government for export approval to China. According to the Wall Street Journal, these talks began earlier this year, with the chip's peak performance reaching only 80% of the standard Blackwell GPU's performance.

President Donald Trump has commented that he will allow Nvidia to ship a Blackwell if it's at least 30% less performant than the company's top offering. “It is possible I would make a deal [on a] ‘somewhat enhanced in a negative way' Blackwell processor,” Trump said to reporters. “In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it.” By comparison, the Nvidia HGX H20 is only around 50% of the performance of the full-fat H100, especially in multi-GPU setups.

The U.S. banned the sale of H20 in mid-April, resulting in a $5.5 billion write-off for Nvidia. However, it reversed this decision some three months later by issuing export licenses, allowing the company to resume sales in China in exchange for 15% of its sales in the country. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that this was part of the negotiations for China to loosen its grip on rare-earth minerals — a crucial resource required to produce semiconductors, high-tech equipment, and defense technologies.

However, this was soon followed by warnings from Chinese state media saying that the H20 is unsafe and outdated, and the authorities have reportedly discouraged organizations, especially government bodies, from using it. All of this supposedly came from Sec. Lutnick's abrasive ‘addiction' comments, which the Chinese leadership called insulting. However, some experts say that Nvidia and its AI chips are being used as a political maneuvering tool by both sides, primarily as China and the U.S. are engaged in a trade war.

“If the U.S. government were to approve a powerful Blackwell for China, even at a 30-to-50% performance reduction,” said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior adviser to RAND Corporation, a think tank with offices in Washington, D.C. “My guess is we'd miraculously see China forget about security concerns.”

This is probably why we've seen claims that Nvidia is asking its suppliers to wind down H20 production. The company did not confirm this, though, only telling Tom's Hardware that it constantly manages its supply chain to match market conditions. Still, the AI giant is working to prepare a next-generation offering for H2O. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has told reporters that the company is in talks with the United States government for this, but that the negotiations are still in the early stages.

We are yet to see if the White House will approve the sales of the B30 chip in its current iteration to China. Nvidia likely needs this to move forward to retain its leadership in the East Asian country, especially as Beijing appears to be successful in encouraging Chinese companies to reduce their reliance on H2O.

The number of people with type 2 diabetes — a condition where a person cannot regulate their blood glucose — is rising rapidly. In 2017, around 462 million people, or 6.28% of the world's population lived with the condition. 

By 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the number of people living with diabetes worldwide had risen to more than 800 million, of whom 95% had type 2 diabetes. And the condition can lead to complications such as cardiovascular disease, vision problems and kidney disease.

Obesity and overweight are common in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and losing weight can help manage symptoms, or even reverse the condition in some. Now, a study suggests that turmeric or curcumin supplements might help people with these conditions on their weight-loss journey.

The review of 20 randomized controlled trials, published in Nutrition & Diabetes, found that turmeric or curcumin — the active component of turmeric — had a beneficial effect on some indicators of obesity, and might therefore help with weight management in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS, physician-scientist and assistant professor at the RUSH Institute for Healthy Aging, RUSH University, College of Health Sciences, not involved in this study, commented to Medical News Today that:

“The findings are modest but noteworthy. The meta-analysis showed that turmeric/curcumin supplementation led to small but significant reductions in body weight, waist circumference, fat mass percentage, and hip circumference in people with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. From a scientific standpoint, these changes, about 2 kg (5 lbs) of weight loss and [approximately] 2–3 cm (about an inch) off the waist, may seem small, but in population health even minor improvements in central obesity can reduce metabolic and cardiovascular risk.”

Turmeric has long been used to add flavor and color to foods, and can also be taken as a supplement. Studies suggest that it may have antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, and that it is generally safe and well tolerated at the dosages found in food, although may have some side effects at higher dosages.

This latest review investigated the effects of turmeric/curcumin supplementation on measures of body size, including body weight, body mass index (BMI), percentage of fat mass, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and hip circumference, in 20 different studies.

All were randomized controlled trials comparing supplementation with placebo, carried out in adults with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.

Participants in the studies were given dosages ranging from 80 milligrams per day (mg/day) to 2,100 mg/day, for 8– 36 weeks. The researchers noted that adverse events, such as stomachache, itching, vertigo, constipation, hot flashes, and nausea, were reported in only 3 of the 20 studies.

In people with type 2 diabetes, turmeric/curcumin supplementation led to improvements in body weight, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and hip circumference, but not BMI or waist-to-hip ratio.

For those with prediabetes, supplements significantly reduced body weight and waist circumference, but again had no effect on BMI.

The researchers also found significant associations between dosage and waist circumference, and between duration of supplementation and body weight.

Two of the study authors, Leila Azadbakht, PhD, professor of nutritional Sciences, and Mohammadreza Moradi Baniasadi, MSc in the Department of Community Nutrition at the School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, both at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran, commented on their findings.

They told MNT that “the most useful finding is the dose-response relationship: Supplementation for [more than] 22 weeks significantly reduced body weight —[weighted mean difference of] -2.5 kg — and doses [of more than] 15,00 mg/day lowered waist circumference — [weighted mean difference of] -1.8 cm — in [type 2 diabetes] patients.”

“This provides practical guidance for clinicians on optimal dosing and duration to achieve meaningful effects, highlighting the potential of turmeric/curcumin as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions for weight control in diabetes management,” they added.

Eamon Laird, PhD, assistant lecturer in Human Nutrition at Atlantic Technological University Sligo, and adjunct assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin, not involved in the study explained for MNT that:

“Turmeric/curcumin could influence metabolism, reducing inflammation, and potentially impacting (reducing) appetite. Some studies suggest curcumin can enhance thermogenesis (calorie burning for heat production), which could contribute to weight loss over time. Additionally, curcumin's anti-inflammatory properties may help counteract some of the inflammation (cytokines) associated with obesity and diabetes.”

Several studies have suggested that turmeric may help with weight loss, but there is little clear evidence as to how it has its effects, as Azadbakht and Baniasadi told us.

“While the precise mechanism remains somewhat enigmatic, we believe the activation of AMPK and the anti-inflammatory properties are the most likely primary modes, as they directly link to improved insulin sensitivity, reduced chronic inflammation — common in [type 2 diabetes] and prediabetes‚ and enhanced fat metabolism,” the study authors explained.

Laird welcomed the study as interesting but highlighted “significant limitations to consider before getting too excited.”

“Firstly,” he told MNT, “out of the 20 studies in the analysis 13 are from the same country (Iran). This limits the potential effects/applicability to the general public as there could be just something unique about that population whether it be genetics or just other dietary or other components not controlled for.”

“Moreover, there was a wide range of doses and forms of the product used, wide variations in the study duration whilst the majority of the studies were in mostly older female adults,” he added.

Azadbakht and Baniasadi outlined how they hope to address these issues, noting: “We are considering further research to address limitations in the current evidence base. This includes larger, longer-term [randomized controlled trials] focusing on high-absorption formulations and combinations with lifestyle interventions.”

“We also aim to explore effects in diverse populations (e.g. varying ethnicities or comorbidities) and investigate mechanistic pathways more deeply […] to better predict responders and optimize safety.”

“This research is encouraging, but we need to be cautious. The overall effect sizes are small, and the certainty of evidence is low to moderate, meaning stronger, larger trials are still needed. […] For patients, the takeaway is that turmeric can be a helpful addition to a healthy lifestyle, but it's not a shortcut to weight loss. Clinicians should frame it as a ‘supportive therapy' alongside established treatments, like lifestyle and medications, for diabetes and obesity.”

Nayiri  Guedikian, MD, MPH

DISCLOSURES August 22, 2025  



This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Choosing a specialty can be tough, but here are five steps to guide you. 

First, reflect on your clinical experiences. What rotations made you lose track of time or feel excited to go back the next day?

Second, assess your strengths. Are you hands-on and procedural, or more cerebral and diagnostic? 

Third, consider lifestyle factorslike call schedule, income potential, and how the specialty fits into your long-term goals. 

Fourth, get real-world insight. Talk to residents and attendings, ask honest questions, and try to shadow different specialties if you're unsure. 

Finally, trust your gut. If a field excites you and feels sustainable, that's worth listening to.

This isn't just about prestige or pressure; it's about where you will thrive for the long haul.

Prostate cancer remains a global health challenge, ranking as the second most common malignancy among men. While early-stage disease can be effectively managed, advanced forms-particularly metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)-pose significant therapeutic hurdles. A growing body of evidence highlights the pivotal role of SOX transcription factors, with SOX2 emerging as a central driver in tumor growth, spread, and resistance to therapy.

SOX2 is intricately linked to the fate of cancer stem/progenitor cells, influencing processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which fuel invasion and metastasis. Elevated SOX2 levels are frequently observed in aggressive tumors and are associated with poor prognosis. Its activity extends to shaping tumor lineage plasticity, enabling cancer cells to adapt and survive under therapeutic pressure. This adaptability often facilitates transformation into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), an aggressive variant with limited treatment options.

At the molecular level, SOX2 operates within a complex regulatory network, interacting with key transcription factors, non-coding RNAs, and epigenetic modifications. It is also a critical node in multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, Hedgehog, Wnt/β-catenin, and TGF-β, which collectively sustain cancer stem cell traits and drive disease progression. Importantly, SOX2's regulation involves both upstream inducers such as BRN2, TRIB2, and NRP2, and downstream effectors including LSD1, H19, SPINK1, and ASCL1-each contributing to tumor aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance.

SOX2's role in treatment resistance is particularly significant. It supports resistance to chemotherapy by inducing a reversible quiescent state and activating survival pathways, while also mediating resistance to nuclear hormone receptor signaling inhibitors through modulation of cell cycle regulators and glucocorticoid receptor expression. This makes SOX2 a critical obstacle in sustaining long-term therapeutic success in advanced prostate cancer.

The potential of targeting SOX2-directly or indirectly-offers a promising avenue for innovation. Strategies may include disrupting its protein-protein interactions, modulating upstream regulators or downstream pathways, and harnessing small-molecule inhibitors to selectively curb its tumor-promoting functions. However, given SOX2's importance in normal tissue regeneration, therapeutic approaches must balance efficacy with safety to minimize adverse effects.

As research advances, understanding the multifaceted role of SOX2 could pave the way for more precise, effective, and durable treatments, offering hope for patients battling the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer.

A new article in Veterinary Pathology introduces a 9-point checklist designed to improve the reporting quality of studies that use artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated image analysis (AIA). As AI tools become more widely used in pathology-based research, concerns have emerged about the reproducibility and transparency of published findings.

Developed by an interdisciplinary team of veterinary pathologists, machine learning experts, and journal editors, the checklist outlines key methodological details that should be included in manuscripts. These include dataset creation, model training, performance evaluation, and interaction with the AI system. The aim is to support clear communication of methods and reduce cognitive and algorithmic bias.

""Transparent reporting is critical for reproducibility and for translating AI tools into routine pathology workflows,"" the authors write. They emphasize that the availability of supporting data-such as training datasets, source code, and model weights, is essential for meaningful validation and broader application.

In a preclinical study, researchers found tamoxifen encourages uterine cell growth; the findings could change how some breast cancers are treated in the future.

Studies show that people receiving tamoxifen, a highly effective and commonly used therapy to treat breast cancer, face a 2- to 7-fold increased risk of developing uterine cancer within 2-5 years of tamoxifen treatment compared to the general population. While this secondary cancer risk remains relatively low and tamoxifen continues to provide substantial benefit for most patients, it is important to understand even small risks to improve long-term outcomes. A new study led by researchers at Mass General Brigham, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) at Charité sheds light on the mechanism underlying this link and how blocking a specific molecular pathway may offer a way to prevent uterine cancers from occurring in patients taking tamoxifen.

""Our findings suggest that tamoxifen activates a cell growth signaling pathway in cells in the uterus,"" said co-corresponding author Gad Getz, PhD, Director of Bioinformatics at the Mass General Cancer Center, part of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system and an Institute Member at Broad.

""Importantly, they also point to a potential way to intervene to prevent patients with breast cancer from developing a second, serious cancer in the future,"" said co-corresponding author Kirsten Kübler, MD, PhD, formerly a research fellow in Medicine at Mass General Brigham, currently an Associated Scientist at the Broad Institute and a professor at the BIH.

Researchers performed whole-exome sequencing of 21 uterine cancers that were associated with previous tamoxifen use, and compared their genetic makeup with those of non-tamoxifen-associated uterine cancers in published databases. Results, published in Nature Genetics, found only 14% of post-tamoxifen uterine cancers harbored cancer-related PIK3CA mutations, compared to 48% of uterine cancers diagnosed in women who hadn't taken tamoxifen. This finding of lower rates of PIK3CA mutations, a key component of the PI3K pathway, in tamoxifen-exposed patients was validated in three independent cohorts.

To see how tamoxifen might induce cancer without inducing genetic changes, the researchers exposed mice to estrogen, tamoxifen, or no treatment. Compared to the other groups, mice exposed to tamoxifen had greater activity in the P13K-AKT pathway, which regulates uterine cell growth, in part through insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), a hormone that encourages cell growth.

Researchers then exposed mice to both tamoxifen and alpelisib, a drug that blocks the P13K pathway and is also used in the treatment of breast cancer. The addition of alpelisib significantly decreased PI3K-AKT signaling, IGF1 receptor activation, and cell proliferation.

Importantly, the study suggests that blocking the PIK3 pathway could reduce the low but concerning risk of tamoxifen-associated uterine cancer.

Future clinical research can confirm whether combining non-mutant selective PI3K inhibitors with tamoxifen reduces the risk of uterine cancer and ultimately saves lives.""

Working-age adults with disabilities experience far higher rates of loneliness than those without, according to a new study from researchers at the Brown University School of Public Health and the Warren Alpert Medical School.

The analysis found that nearly one third of adults with disabilities between the ages of 18 and 64 reported persistent feelings of loneliness in a national survey that asked how often they felt a lack of companionship, left out, or isolated. About two thirds of respondents said they often experienced severe loneliness, regardless of the type of disability.

The work shines a spotlight on a significant but often overlooked public health concern regarding people with disabilities and the structural barriers that often limit their full participation in work, community and daily life.

Loneliness is known to be a risk factor for morbidity and mortality, but there is sparse research about loneliness among people with disabilities, especially in the age group of adults younger than 65. Our study calls attention to the need for further research focused on working-age adults with disabilities, both to characterize the factors driving their exceptionally high loneliness burden and to mitigate downstream health consequences.""

Melissa A. Clark, professor of health services, policy and practice, and director of the Survey, Qualitative and Applied Data (SQuAD) Research Core

Published in Annals of Internal Medicine, the new study analyzed survey data from more than 3,800 working-age adults with disabilities in the U.S. who participated in the National Survey on Health and Disability. In one wave of the survey, conducted from October 2019 to January 2020, researchers found that severe loneliness affected 65% of participants. In a second wave, conducted from October 2023 to February 2024, that number rose to 68%.

In the first and second wave, 30% and 33% of respondents said they often felt a lack of companionship; 29% and 37% said they often felt left out; and 34% and 40% said they often felt isolated.

These rates are much higher than among people without disabilities, Clark and co-author Maggie Salinger, an assistant professor of medicine, point out. In a nationally representative survey of more than 20,000 U.S. adults, for instance, just 8% of adults reported often feeling left out or isolated and only 10% said they often felt alone.

""We think people with disabilities may be predisposed to loneliness, since disability is a byproduct of social and structural barriers that restrict people's access to full societal participation,"" Salinger said. ""We are worried that a disproportionately high degree of loneliness could compound the array of health disparities already known to affect people with disabilities, which is why we set out to quantify their burden of loneliness and study it more closely.""

The Brown team's findings also point to solutions, showing why addressing loneliness must be part of broader efforts to improve health equity for people with disabilities.

""The loneliness crisis is already on public health officials' radars,"" Clark said. ""This study shows them how important it is to design loneliness interventions that are both accessible and tailored to people with varied disability types.""

The identification of Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) as a crucial biomarker in liver disease is revolutionizing how clinicians approach the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of various liver conditions. As a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 18, CHI3L1 is recognized for its unique ability to bind to ligands and influence multiple pathophysiological processes, despite lacking enzymatic activity. This distinctive protein plays a key role in mediating cell proliferation, inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis.

Liver diseases, including hepatitis-related fibrosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), represent significant global health challenges. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical to managing these conditions effectively, but traditional methods such as liver biopsy are invasive and not ideal for frequent monitoring. Serum biomarkers offer a non-invasive alternative, and CHI3L1 has emerged as a reliable marker, especially for diagnosing and staging hepatic fibrosis. Elevated levels of CHI3L1 correlate with fibrosis severity, particularly in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and chronic hepatitis C (CHC), where it demonstrates superior diagnostic efficacy compared to conventional markers like hyaluronic acid (HA) and FIB-4.

In addition to its diagnostic capabilities, CHI3L1 plays a significant role in evaluating fibrosis progression and monitoring the efficacy of antiviral therapies. The protein's levels increase proportionally with the advancement of liver fibrosis, making it a practical tool for assessing treatment response. Furthermore, CHI3L1 has shown promise in distinguishing between simple steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is vital for identifying patients at higher risk of progressing to cirrhosis or HCC. Combining CHI3L1 with other markers, such as alpha-fetal protein (AFP) and platelet count, enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in detecting significant fibrosis and advanced stages of liver disease.

One of the most promising applications of CHI3L1 is its potential to predict the prognosis of HCC. Studies indicate that elevated CHI3L1 levels correlate with poor survival rates, especially after curative resection. When combined with AFP, CHI3L1 significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy for HCC, offering clinicians a more reliable method for early detection and risk assessment. The integration of CHI3L1 measurements with routine clinical practice could transform patient management by enabling more precise risk stratification and tailored therapies.

The growing body of evidence supports the use of CHI3L1 not only as a biomarker for liver fibrosis but also as a potential therapeutic target. As a key regulator of fibrosis and inflammation, targeting CHI3L1 could mitigate disease progression and improve outcomes for patients suffering from chronic liver diseases. Further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying CHI3L1's actions will enhance our understanding of liver pathology and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies.

Air pollution from oil and gas is causing 91,000 premature deaths and hundreds of thousands of health issues across the United States annually, with Black, Asian, Native American and Hispanic groups consistently the most affected, finds a major new study led by researchers at UCL and the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI).

The research, published in Science Advances, is the first to comprehensively quantify the health impacts of outdoor air pollution across all stages of the US oil and gas lifecycle, from extraction to end-use (cars, power plants), as well as to analyse the associated racial and ethnic disparities in exposure and health burden.

In addition, the researchers found that 10,350 pre-term births and 216,000 new cases of childhood asthma per year were attributable to oil and gas air pollution, as well as 1,610 lifetime cancers across the US.

For the study, the research team used advanced computer models to map air pollution from oil and gas activities across the US. They then used this information, along with established health risk data, to estimate the number of severe health outcomes like asthma, preterm birth, and early death. 

We used a state-of-the-science air quality model to separate air pollution caused by each major stage of the oil and gas lifecycle from other sources of air pollution. This enabled us to work out and compare health outcomes. What we found was striking: one in five preterm births and adult deaths linked to fine particulate pollution are from oil and gas. Even more concerning is that nearly 90% of new childhood asthma cases tied to nitrogen dioxide pollution were from this sector.""

Dr. Karn Vohra, Lead Author, UCL Geography, now at University of Birmingham

The US has one of the world's largest oil and gas industries but the health impacts and inequities from its air pollution have been poorly characterized. The research quantifies the health impacts of air pollution across all oil and gas lifecycle stages, from exploration, extraction and drilling (upstream), through to compression, transport and storage (midstream), refinement or transformation into petrochemical products (downstream) and consumer end-use.

The researchers found that the final end-use stage, mostly from burning fossil fuels, overwhelmingly contributes the greatest detrimental health burden, accounting for 96% of total incidents linked to the oil and gas sector. The five states that experience the greatest total health burden from all stages are amongst the most populated (California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey). When normalised for population, residents in New Jersey, the District of Columbia, New York, California, and Maryland are subject to the greatest health impacts.

Across the US, marginalised ethnic and racial groups face the greatest exposure to air pollution and health impacts across all stages. Native American and Hispanic populations are most affected by upstream and midstream stages while Black and Asian populations are most affected by downstream and end-use stages.

On a national scale, downstream activities cause far less pollution than upstream and end-use activities, but this stage is the cause for greatest relative adverse health outcomes for the Black population, particularly in Southern Louisiana (the region known as ""Cancer Alley"") and eastern Texas. The health outcomes for the Black population that are more severe than national incidences include premature mortality, preterm births, and development of asthma amongst children.

Much of the disparity in exposures and health outcomes stem from a legacy of zoning practices, such as ""redlining,"" that relegated certain populations to live near pollution hotspots such as industrial areas or high-traffic roadways. Permitting of large factories that produce products from oil and gas is another contributing factor.

Senior author, Professor Eloise Marais (UCL Geography), said: ""It is well known that air pollution from oil and gas activities causes certain communities to experience worse health outcomes. These communities are already aware of this unjust exposure and the disproportionately large health burdens they experience. Our study puts science-backed numbers on just how large these unfair exposures and health outcomes are.""

The researchers were also able to track air pollution across borders, attributing 1,170 early deaths in southern Canada and 440 early deaths in northern Mexico to oil and gas air pollution from the US.

Co-author Dr Ploy Achakulwisut (SEI) said: ""Our study provides yet another compelling case for why we need to accelerate the phase-out of oil and gas production and combustion with hard numbers: hundreds of thousands of children, adults, and the elderly in the US could be saved from illnesses and early deaths every year. We therefore have an imperative to not only urgently transition away from fossil fuels to achieve net-zero emissions to save lives in the long term from climate devastation, but also to save lives and minimize environmental injustices in the near term from air pollution exposure.""

The researchers developed a comprehensive inventory of oil and gas air pollution sources, then ran it through a computer model that calculates the complex air chemistry that forms harmful pollutants across the US. They then used these air pollutant concentrations with epidemiological evidence of the relationship between exposure and health risk along with census and health data to determine multiple adverse health outcomes and racial-ethnic disparities.

The researchers compiled data for the year 2017, the most recent year of complete data available. They added that their estimates are most likely conservative as US oil and gas production has increased by 40% and consumption by 8% between 2017 and 2023, and their work only focused on outdoor air pollution.

This analysis was carried out by researchers from UCL, the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), George Washington University and University of Colorado Boulder.

Researchers from Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine and collaborating Japanese institutions found that patients carrying colibactin-producing Escherichia coli (pks+ E. coli) in their colon polyps were more than three times as likely to have a history of colorectal cancer compared to those without the bacterium.

The findings, published in eGastroenterology, highlight a potential role for gut microbes in accelerating cancer risk in people with a strong genetic predisposition.

Between 2018 and 2019, the team studied 75 FAP patients who had not yet undergone colon surgery, preserving their natural gut microbiota. Tissue samples from colon polyps and surrounding mucosa were collected during endoscopy and analyzed for pks+ E. coli.

This study raises the possibility that targeting specific microbes could help prevent cancer in high-risk groups.""

The researchers propose that colibactin, a toxin produced by the bacterium, damages DNA and triggers inflammatory signals that may accelerate tumor progression in the already vulnerable colonic tissue of FAP patients.

The study is among the first to examine the role of gut bacteria in FAP patients before surgery, offering a rare glimpse into the natural microbial environment of this population.

The authors caution that the findings are preliminary and based on a relatively small patient group. Larger, multicenter studies are needed to confirm the results. If validated, the research could pave the way for new approaches, such as:

The study provides early but compelling evidence that colibactin-producing E. coli may play a role in colorectal cancer development in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. By shining light on the interplay between genes, microbes, and environment, the findings open new avenues for cancer prevention strategies in hereditary syndromes.

Gio Reyna's next step could be becoming clearer as Bundesliga side Borussia Mönchengladbach are reported to have reached a deal in principle to sign the 22-year-old American from Borussia Dortmund. 

While the deal has yet to be confirmed, Florian Plettenberg reported the clubs have agreed in principle to move to the next steps in the transfer process, which includes at least €3 million ($3.5 million) and potential bonuses 

Reyna, who hopes to be a key member of the U.S. men's national team at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, had fallen out of favor with Dortmund in 2024–25, struggling for playing time as he approached the final year of his contract, set to expire next summer. 

This summer, Reyna was omitted from head coach Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT squad, as Dortmund included him in their team for the FIFA Club World Cup. However, Reyna only appeared in one game, coming in as a substitute in a group stage match. 

Reyna spent part of the 2024–25 season on loan with English Premier League side Nottingham Forest, where he made 10 appearances, after struggling for any consistent playing time with Dortmund. 

Having joined as a 16 year old, Reyna has 19 goals and 18 assists in 147 appearances with Dortmund, and earned his first USMNT callup as a member of the Bundesliga giants when he made his debut ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. 

With the USMNT, Reyna has eight goals in 32 appearances, but struggled to crack regular minutes under previous head coach Gregg Berhalter, and has yet to get significant opportunities with Pochettino.  

Meanwhile, Gladbach would reunite him with USMNT teammate Joe Scally, who came up with him in their early developmental stages through the New York City FC academy. Scally, a key member of the USMNT, has been capped 21 times and has made 133 appearances for Gladbach. 

After falling out of regular minutes, a move has appeared to be the key next step for Reyna, and he will hope to regain his form and status as a regular contributor in Europe's top leagues once a deal crosses the line. 

Gladbach open their 2025–26 Bundesliga season on Sunday against newly promoted Hamburg SV, while Dortmund start their campaign on Saturday against FC St. Pauli, with Reyna still on the roster.

Summer Transfer

Window

Gio Reyna has completed his move from Borussia Dortmund to Borussia Monchengladbach.

The Athletic reported on Friday that Gladbach had agreed a deal in principle to sign the USMNT international and he underwent a medical ahead of the transfer on Saturday.

With Reyna's Dortmund contract set to expire next summer, the club felt a long-term extension to his deal would not make sense for either party.

Reyna, 22, was open to the move in his search for regular football ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which the United States will co-host. The move to Gladbach sees him link up with international team-mate and close friend Joe Scally, with whom he came through the NYCFC ranks.

Clubs in Spain and Portugal previously looked at the attacking midfielder, while Parma in Italy had also previously expressed an interest.

Reyna joined Dortmund aged 16 in July 2019. He became the youngest player to make 50 Bundesliga appearances aged 18 years and 14 days, a record that has since been broken by Florian Wirtz, but his game time has been limited in recent seasons.

Reyna has only started 14 Bundesliga games since the beginning of the 2021-22 season, and made 26 appearances last season with just five of those as a starter. He spent the second half of the 2023-24 campaign on loan at Nottingham Forest.

Reyna was sidelined for two and a half months last season, missing 19 games for club and country, after picking up a groin issue in early September 2024.

He was not included in Mauricio Pochettino's Gold Cup squad this summer as Dortmund wanted him to be a part of the Club World Cup squad. He made just one substitute appearance in the 1-0 group-stage win over Ulsan HD as the German club reached the quarter-finals.

Capped 32 times since receiving his first USMNT call-up in November 2020, Reyna has featured 147 times for Dortmund, scoring 19 goals and providing 18 assists.

The end for Reyna at Dortmund has been coming for a while. It's been several years since he was a consistent member of the first team: he started three Bundesliga games last season and just one the year before.

The need for a career reset is self-evident and perhaps Gladbach, who remain a big club, albeit one some way down from its historic peaks in the 1970s, can be an ideal venue to rediscover some momentum.

Talent was not the problem in Dortmund. Instead, it was availability, and Reyna's struggle to avoid the small muscular issues that have so often derailed his progress and prevented him from establishing a rhythm at the Westfalenstadion. Ultimately, that is why the club have allowed his contract to run down and now, with a year left until its end, are happy to allow him to leave.

Can Reyna regain his status in the game? Within his camp, there's hope that the right club and the faith of the right coach could elevate him back in the European perception. For now, though, the aim is simpler: he must find somewhere to play consistently. At just 22, there's plenty of time yet.

Breaking News Reporter

President Donald Trump had his latest bling request for the Oval Office denied.

Trump, 79, could not resist asking to keep the FIFA World Cup trophy after it was displayed in his office on Friday, but FIFA President Gianni Infantino politely informed him that it was not his to take.

Still, Trump marveled at the historic trophy's beauty—and spoke at length about his own drastic remodeling of the Oval Office, which has transformed the once-subtle space into a cut-price Palace of Versailles. 

“Can I keep it?” Trump asked Infantino, who had just handed him the most revered prize in international soccer. “Seriously, it fits very well on the wall right over there. We'll put it right below the angels.”

Infantino, chuckling nervously, explained that the historic trophy—hoisted by every World Cup winner since 1974, the last being Lionel Messi's Argentina team—has to be saved for next summer's tournament winners.

Trump relented and released the relic. He was not so generous with this summer's FIFA Club World Cup trophy, also made of gold, which he bizarrely commandeered after the tournament. Trump went onto the field for the trophy presentation at the final in New Jersey and now keeps it on display in the Oval Office. The tournament's winners, Chelsea, a club from London, had to be shipped a replica.

Infantino still made sure that the president was not leaving their meeting empty-handed. In addition to praising his Washington, D.C., crackdown and suggesting that the perennially mediocre U.S. men's national soccer team actually has a shot at winning the World Cup next summer, he also gifted Trump an oversized cardboard version of the “first ticket” for next year's tournament final, which will also be just outside New York City.

Holding the World Cup trophy—which is pure gold on a malachite base—got Trump on a roll talking about his love for his favorite precious metal, which now occupies seemingly every other inch of the Oval Office.

“You see the way this is looking nice?” Trump asked reporters, gesturing to the blinding amount of golden trinkets and gilding that now consume the space. “I can't tell you how much that gold costs—a lot of money. There's nothing like gold, and there's nothing like solid gold.”

The president said a drastic change was needed in the Oval Office, which he claimed was not “representative” of the position the way former presidents had it decorated. 

“When we took it over, it was dirty, not clean,” he said. “I immediately changed the chair and had this beautiful desk renovated… This was not appropriate for the Oval Office when I took over.”

The amount of gold in the office has slowly grown throughout the year. It began with a few shiny trinkets in the first days of MAGA 2.0, but exploded after Trump flew his personal “gold guy,” John Icart, up from South Florida to get gilding in April. 

Trump officials said Icart added gold accents to the Oval Office's mantel, where the office's iconic potted Swedish Ivy once sat. He also gilded its walls, the moldings that wrap around the office, and delivered golden cherubs that are now on display.

Trump said he thinks the office makeover will stand the test of time. 

“They can't imagine anyone changing it,” he said. “People come in. They really love it. They love what we're doing here.”

...

Cristiano Ronaldo became the first player to score 100 competitive goals for four different clubs on Saturday, though Al-Nassr lost to Al-Ahli in a penalty shootout after the Saudi Super Cup final ended 2-2.

The first half strike at Hong Kong Stadium took the 40-year-old to his century for the Saudi Arabian club, which he joined in Dec.2022.

It adds to his 450 goals for Real Madrid, 145 for Manchester United and 101 for Juventus and moves Ronaldo ahead of the three players who had scored 100 times for three clubs: Isidro Langara, who played in Spain from 1930 to 1948, as well as Brazilian stars Romario and Neymar.

Ronaldo, who has yet to win a major trophy in Saudi Arabia, is also the leading international goalscorer with 138 goals for Portugal.

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner put Al-Nassr ahead after 41 minutes with a penalty, though Franck Kessie quickly equalized for Al-Ahli.

With seven minutes remaining, Marcelo Brozovic restored Al-Nassr's lead but there was still time for Brazilian defender Ibanez to head home a corner and take the game into a penalty shootout.

Ronaldo scored once more from the spot but his teammate Abdullah Al-Khaibari did not and Al-Ahli won 5-3 to lift the first trophy of the Saudi Arabian season.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

President Donald Trump has put the FIFA World Cup 2026 tournament firmly in the American political crosshairs.

The president on Friday announced that the 48-team World Cup draw will be held on Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., NBC News reported. 

Trump has caused controversy by taking effective control of the venerated arts center, which is named after assassinated President John F. Kennedy. 

The World Cup draw will let countries across the globe know who their tournament opponents will be. 

Alluding to the Kennedy Center controversy, Trump on Friday quipped, “Some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we're not prepared to do that quite yet. Maybe in a week or so,” according to Newsweek. 

Trump was recently elected chairman of the board of the Kennedy Center. 

Trump has been deeply involved in World Cup events. He attended the FIFA Club World Cup Final at MetLife Stadium this year and has spoken regularly with FIFA president Gianni Infantino. 

The 2026 World Cup will be the first World Cup with three host countries (the U.S., Canada and Mexico), and will be the first to feature a 48-team field.

There will be 11 host cities in the U.S, three in Mexico and two in Canada.

The World Cup will kick off in Mexico with two matches on June 11, 2026. 

MetLife will host the World Cup Final on July 19, 2026. 

The World Cup tournament is the most widely watched sporting event in the world. An estimated 1.5 billion people tuned in to watch the World Cup final in 2022.

Trump says Kennedy Center to host Cup draw

Venue also site of $257m renovation project

2026 World Cup spans US, Canada and Mexico

Donald Trump announced Friday that the draw for the 2026 men's World Cup will be held on 5 December at Washington's Kennedy Center – and suggested he may even take part himself.

The US president made the announcement in the Oval Office alongside Fifa president Gianni Infantino and vice-president JD Vance. The ceremony will determine the 12 groups and opening fixtures for the first World Cup to feature 48 teams.

“It's the biggest, probably the biggest event in sports,” said Trump, 79, wearing a red hat reading: Trump Was Right About Everything. Infantino likened the month-long tournament to “104 Super Bowls”, prompting Trump to add: “Some of them are bigger than Super Bowls, actually.”

The 2026 finals will be co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico. The tournament begins on 11 June at Mexico City's Azteca Stadium and ends on 19 July at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Washington is not among the 16 host cities, but Trump has turned the Kennedy Center into his personal fiefdom, installing himself as chair, replacing its board with loyalists and floating the name “Trump-Kennedy Center”.

Infantino carried the World Cup trophy into the Oval Office, breaking a superstition that only past winners should touch it. “It's for winners only,” he said, before handing it to Trump. The president fumbled momentarily before placing it on his desk. “That's a beautiful piece of gold,” Trump said. “Can I keep it?” Infantino later presented him with a giant ticket marked Row 1, Seat 1 for the final.

Trump also used the event to tout his federal crime crackdown in Washington, where he has deployed the National Guard and taken control of the city's police force. “It's going to be very safe,” he said. “Gianni, you can walk down the street with your beautiful wife … if you can get a reservation.”

Asked if he would draw the team names himself, Trump smiled and deferred to Infantino. “It's a very interesting proposal,” the Fifa chief replied.

The choice of venue ends months of speculation that the draw might land in Las Vegas, which staged the 1994 ceremony headlined by Stevie Wonder. This time, 42 of the 48 qualifiers will be known by December, with the final six decided in playoff matches next March.

Trump went further, suggesting Russian president Vladimir Putin “wants to be there very badly” for the finals, though “it may depend on the outcome of peace efforts in Ukraine.”

The Republican, who won re-election in 2024, has redecorated the Oval Office in gilded tones since returning to power. The Kennedy Center, now undergoing a $257m renovation, will double as Fifa's new US headquarters. Trump has called it a showpiece for America's 250th anniversary celebrations next year.

Fifa has also expanded its US presence, opening offices in Miami and New York's Trump Tower.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

On Friday, just hours before President Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino's latest joint briefing in the White House, the MGM Resorts group in Las Vegas received a courtesy correspondence. It came from FIFA. It was a short and generic email. It said, essentially: Thank you, but no thank you.

The expectation of many involved in next summer's World Cup plans had been that the competition's draw would take place in Las Vegas. There had, however, always been a but that never went away.

That but, first reported by The Athletic in April, was that Washington, D.C. — and, more precisely, Infantino — wanted to ensure it would be easy for Trump to participate in the draw, if he wished.

On Friday afternoon, that suspicion finally crystallized when, in a remarkable news conference in the Oval Office, Trump announced the draw would take place at the Kennedy Center, the performing arts and events space in D.C. According to sources familiar with the discussions, who wished to remain anonymous to protect relationships, the venue was suggested by Trump's administration, and Infantino fell into line, despite numerous FIFA officials preferring Las Vegas. FIFA declined to comment, and a White House spokesperson did not directly address the point, instead sending through a transcript of Friday's press conference.

During his second term, Trump became the chairman of the Kennedy Center, named after the 35th U.S. President, John F. Kennedy. In February, Trump railed against the content shown at the venue, saying: “We don't need woke at the Kennedy Center.”

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the center would have “no more drag shows or anti-American propaganda.” His administration removed 18 board members who had been appointed by his predecessor, Joe Biden, to what used to be a bipartisan board, while appointing those loyal to Trump, such as his chief of staff Susie Wiles and Usha Vance, the wife of Vice President JD Vance. He revealed last week that he will host the upcoming Kennedy Center Honors ceremony and said he turned down “wokesters” as potential award-winners.

Rep. Bob Onder (R-MO) last month introduced the Make Entertainment Great Again legislation, which seeks to rename the Kennedy Center after Trump. Onder said he would be “hard-pressed to find a more significant cultural icon in the past 40 years” than Trump, while Trump joked about the name change in Friday's news conference alongside Infantino.

FIFA's choice of venue for their World Cup draw represents the latest episode of FIFA appearing to bend over backwards to please Trump.

This summer, FIFA opened an office in Trump Tower in New York City, choosing it instead of other office space it had considered in the Empire State Building. The Club World Cup final culminated in a ceremony in which Trump presented Premier League team Chelsea with the trophy. He joined in the trophy lift and then took the ornament back to the White House, where it still resides in his office, along with a winner's medal. Infantino formed part of a bizarre event in the Oval Office in June, when the Italian team Juventus — with its owner, chief executive and leading players in tow — was taken along to a press conference with Trump on the afternoon of their Club World Cup match against Al Ain in D.C.

Over the past six months, The Athletic has spoken frequently with individuals involved in the negotiations for the draw venue. FIFA has remained publicly tight-lipped about where it would hold its draw for the 48-team competition. Negotiations with venues in Las Vegas advanced, and the direction of travel was such that the U.S. Soccer Federation even reserved an events space and hotel rooms as they sought to host a soccer-specific conference around the draw, when many key stakeholders were expected to be in the city. The plans were so advanced that save-the-date messages were sent to key personnel.

A Las Vegas draw would have meant a re-run of sorts for the 1994 edition of the men's World Cup, the only previous occasion when the United States had hosted the competition. It was a star-studded, highly Americanized edition of the draw, featuring Las Vegas appearances from James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Barry Manilow, Sir Rod Stewart and Robin Williams. President Bill Clinton appeared via video.

Along the way, other locations were quickly ruled out. In January, Alejandro Hutt, the director of the host committee in the Mexican city of Monterrey, told ESPN how it, and the Canadian city of Vancouver, had registered an interest in hosting the draw but were told by FIFA the event would be taken elsewhere. Canada and Mexico are each due to host 13 of the 104 World Cup games in a tournament spread across North America, yet Infantino is far more frequently seen rubbing shoulders with Trump than his Canadian or Mexican counterparts.

The Athletic has been frequently told in recent months that sporting and political leaders in Canada and Mexico have been irritated by their increasingly diminished profile around the build-up to next year's tournament and Friday's events, which saw the draw location announced by one country's leader, is unlikely to have helped matters.

Trump, who was in his first presidential term when the joint bid for 2026 won in 2018, joked on Friday that the U.S. “did a little” for Canada and Mexico by allowing them to share the tournament. “See, I'm a good citizen,” he laughed. “I said, ‘Let them have a little piece.' So, we gave a little to Canada. See how nice I am? And we gave a little bit to Mexico.”

Within FIFA, many leading officials liked the idea of returning to Vegas, tapping into the nostalgia of '94 while having the latitude to create a festival-style event that could make a national impact — even amid the NFL season — beyond the names being plucked out of a bowl. They spoke privately of wanting to turn the draw into an entertainment spectacle, mirroring the excitement experienced during drafts in North American sports. FIFA trialled certain Americanisms during the Club World Cup: introducing NBA-style individual walk-ons for players, hiring Michael Buffer for a pre-game “Let's get ready to rumble!” and producing a half-time show during the final at MetLife Stadium.

In 2024, the NHL held its draft at The Sphere, a $2.3 billion, 18,000-seat venue in Las Vegas. This was among FIFA's list of target venues but was rapidly ruled out, likely due to the costs involved. T-Mobile Arena, home of hockey's Vegas Golden Knights, was another option FIFA liked, but the NHL regular-season schedule had not yet been released, making it hard to plan.

FIFA asked about the smaller Dolby Live arena — a 6,400 capacity — but MGM wished to hold the venue for residencies and holiday concerts, particularly eager to entice Mariah Carey back.

FIFA was not only competing for venues in Las Vegas but for hotel rooms. December is a popular time for tourists, but Las Vegas hosts the National Finals Rodeo between Dec. 4-13 at the Thomas & Mack Center. In 2024, more than 170,000 people attended the event across 10 days. Amazon's 60,000-person conference event, AWS re:Invent, is being held in Las Vegas between Dec. 1-5. Talks were held with resorts and Amazon to clear the required space for hotel rooms.

FIFA held extensive negotiations with the 17,000-seat MGM Grand Garden Arena, and a deal was close in May, only for FIFA to stall for several months while weighing up its options. As first reported by Sports Travel Magazine, a group — which The Athletic understands to be MGM — held back thousands of hotel rooms for FIFA's benefit, right until the middle of August when they could no longer afford to risk leaving rooms empty during the holiday season.

FIFA held conversations with Resorts World, which briefly became the favorite. As the summer months passed, MGM lost faith in the Grand Garden Arena's chances. FIFA then went cold on Resorts World, too, which left that group frustrated by FIFA's approach to communication. It all led several venue executives in Las Vegas to suspect FIFA might be taking the event elsewhere this month. One joked privately that the event may end up in Mar-A-Lago, the club and residence owned by Trump in Florida, such is FIFA's apparent cosiness with the president, while whispers of D.C. returned over the past two weeks.

On Friday morning, MGM was thanked by FIFA for its part in the process, and they were disappointed, to put it mildly, at the outcome. Resorts World did not respond to a request for comment, while MGM declined to comment.

The news confirming the pivot from Las Vegas on Friday attracted frustration from key stakeholders. The Athletic has learned that multiple host city committees in the U.S. are exasperated by FIFA's decision. They had never been formally told that Las Vegas would be the destination, but it had been hinted at in some discussions. The host cities liked Las Vegas partly because it would have been seen as more politically neutral than an event space chaired by Trump in D.C. They wanted to entertain prospective sponsors in Sin City, while D.C. is perceived as a more dry experience.

Some host city executives are even unsure whether they will attend the draw, when they could make more exciting watch-along events for sponsors in host cities. The disappointment of the host cities is expected to come through loud and clear during an upcoming workshop with FIFA officials in Houston. The cities were not consulted and only discovered the news shortly before the news conference on Friday. Some feel that the Kennedy Center, while steeped in heritage, is more suited to a black-tie event or an arts performance than the type of party atmosphere they want to launch the World Cup. US Soccer, meanwhile, is working to pivot its own conference out of Las Vegas and into D.C.

While conversations advanced with Vegas, the background noise of D.C. did not go away. The Athletic reported in April how some within FIFA had internally floated the White House as a slimmed-down choice of venue. This, however, would have been logistically testing, particularly given the size of the event, which usually requires thousands of attendees, while the security operation involved — particularly given some of the strained relations with certain countries that could be in attendance — may have posed challenges. Sponsors may also have been uneasy about placing their products inside such an explicitly political venue. Some sources in Las Vegas wondered whether the D.C. threat may be a negotiating tactic by FIFA, aimed at maximizing concessions from resorts.

After all, Trump, who has a hotel in Las Vegas, could have travelled to the draw. He sent a video message for the FIFA Club World Cup draw held in Miami in December 2024, during an event that his daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and grandson Theo attended. Ivanka and Theo even made the ceremonial first picks of the draw.

Right now, the Kennedy Center — or the Trump-Kennedy center, as it may or may not soon be known — is the president's territory, and we should never underestimate Infantino's desire to impress Trump. Infantino held his closing press conference of the Club World Cup in the gold-plated lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan. He attended Trump's inauguration this year and posted 10 times that week on Instagram about the new U.S. president, even wearing a red tie to Sunday's pre-inauguration rally. We can expect Trump to be front and center once more when the draw comes on Dec. 5.

“The Kennedy Center will give (the World Cup) a phenomenal kickoff,” Trump said. “And we'll be involved, and they'll be working over there for quite a bit of time. We have it all set that they can stay there for the big events, the big press conferences, and everything else.”

Read the full transcript of President Trump's remarks on FIFA World Cup, Putin, DC Crime from Oval Office on August 22, 2025. Trump delivers remarks from the Oval Office alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino regarding the FIFA World Cup, while also addressing DC crime statistics and economic updates.



PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much, we have a very big announcement to make today. You all know Gianni, he came all the way from Italy, the beautiful country of Italy to be with us. He just got off the plane and he's a hardworking guy, does a phenomenal job with FIFA, nobody like him.

I'm delighted to welcome FIFA President Gianni Infantino back to the White House for a major announcement about one of the most anticipated competitions in all of sports, the 2026, and this is a big deal, I'll tell you, I was so happy to get it, the 2026 FIFA World Cup. That's going to be the World Cup as we know it, it's the biggest, probably the biggest event in sports, I guess, Gianni, right?

On December 5th of this year, the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center, some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we're not prepared to do that quite yet, maybe in a week or so, but right here in Washington, D.C. It's a tremendous honor to bring the global event and this incredible group of people and these unbelievable athletes, the best athletes in the world, to the cultural center of our nation's capital, just left the Kennedy Center.

We're spending a lot of money wisely on making it really beautiful, it's going to be beautiful again, it's like Washington, D.C. We had, by the way, in Washington, D.C., we have the lowest crime numbers they've had in years, zero, it sounds like it's a horrible thing to say, but I might as well say it, zero murders in the last week since we've done this, that's the first time in memory that that's happened, if you can believe it, how pathetic that is to have to even say it.

And I'm tired of listening to these people say how safe it was before we got here, it was unsafe, it was horrible, and Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor very long, because we'll take it over with the federal government, run it like it's supposed to be run.

The numbers were horrible, it was a crime infested rat hole, and they do have a lot of rats, we're getting rid of them too, and we've made a lot of progress, and it was extremely unsafe, and now it's extremely safe, we had virtually no crime, the number was down 87%, and I'm trying to figure out where was the 13%, because I don't think it existed.

The National Guard has been unbelievable, and they're working with the police, and they have some very good people in there, they have some people that shouldn't be police, actually, but they have some great people there, and Washington, D.C.

That was the other thing I saw numbers, that restaurant business is down in the last week, I know, restaurant business, you can't get into a restaurant, just really lying people, and that's why people don't understand how bad and how dishonest the press is. I saw one poll that had us at 19% favorable on what we're doing with Washington, then I saw another one that says it's 94% favorable, and I can tell you that 94% is correct, the others are fake, just fake news, they got to get their act together, so bad for our country, so sick, actually.

So Washington, D.C. is really doing unbelievably well, and the Kennedy Center that we're fixing, I was just there all morning with the contractors, we're making it, it's going to be unbelievable, it's got great bones, but it needs a lot of work.

The World Cup draw will set up the group stage with competition, 48 teams will play in 104 games across 16 North American cities, from Seattle to Vancouver to Atlanta to Miami, it's going to be so exciting for our country.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be one of the largest and most complex events, this will be one of the greatest events, in a way it's like Gianni said it better, it's like having many Super Bowls in a short period of time, because each one of these games essentially is a Super Bowl, some of them are bigger than Super Bowls actually, but they're essentially, each one of these games is like a Super Bowl.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the largest, most complex set of events in sports history, and the Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kickoff, and we'll be involved, and they'll be working over there for quite a bit of time, we have it all set that they can stay there for the big events, the big press conferences and everything else, and they'll be in a very safe capital, that'll be nice, you don't have to worry about walking down the street, Gianni, okay? But you can handle yourself.

Already, FIFA is projecting 6 million loyal fans will attend the World Cup events next year, and 6 billion more are going to be watching back home, and they think the 6 billion number is going to be actually a low number, and this will drive more than 30 billion dollars into the U.S. economy, and create 185,000 American jobs in a short period of time.

No sporting event attracts more attention, more fans, more viewers, or more revenue than the FIFA World Cup, and again, I'll just say, it's the World Cup, and it's the biggest thing there is in sports, and we have it, and I got it in my first administration, and I was really somewhat devastated, as devastated as I can be, I don't have time to get too devastated.

I was very happy today, as you saw, the group that does this, the government group, radical left group, announced that Trump was right, took in 4 trillion dollars worth of tariffs, that the 4 trillion dollars are going to reduce the deficit by numbers far greater than they ever expected or heard of, and by the way, the stock market went up 1,000 points.

That was as of 10 minutes ago, I can't tell you what happened, a lot of things happened, but the stock market's up almost 1,000 points, and it's basically on the news that the release that just came out from government that the tariffs that everybody was talking about, that the whole world respects us for, because of what we did, the tariffs are going to be at 4 trillion dollars, they're going to reduce the deficit by 4 trillion dollars.

Mr. Vice President, what do you think?

VICE PRESIDENT: That's pretty good, sir.

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Too bad it's not 5, right?

VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.

PRESIDENT TRUMP: It's had a huge impact, and the stock market is way up.

But this will drive more than 30 billion dollars in U.S. economy and create 185,000 American jobs. No sporting event attracts more attention or more fans or anything else, and I just look forward to the draw, so we're going to have the draw, essentially, Gianni, at the Kennedy Center, and by that time, it'll be in even better shape, we're working on it, it'll take, it's about a year project to make it, it'll be great, it'll be fantastic.

You see the way this is looking, look, nice? I can't tell you how much that gold cost, a lot of money. There's nothing like gold, and there's nothing like solid gold, but this beautiful office needed it, it had to be representative, when we took it over, it was dirty, not clean.

I immediately changed the chair and had this beautiful desk renovated, brought out by the White House. People that do this, they did a great job, we have a craftsman who's great, but this was not appropriate for the Oval Office, what I took over, and now, if you look at all those paintings, you're allowed to turn back, all of these are great presidents, and they were all in the vaults, they were in vaults for, in some cases, much more than a hundred years, and now they're proudly hanging on the Oval Office walls, and I can't imagine anybody changing it, but they were buried in vaults for over a hundred years, many of them.

So it's very exciting, people come in, they really love it, they love what we're doing here, they love what we're doing in D.C., and they love what we're doing, most importantly, in the country, in the world.

I'd like to ask Gianni to say a few words, he's the head of the whole thing, he's been there for a long time, probably the most respected man in sports, he's amazing, actually, works very hard, and he's got the biggest event in

the world coming right here to the United States, and a little, we did a little for Canada, we did a little for Mexico, we thought, well, see, I'm a good citizen, I said, let them have a little piece, so we gave a little to Canada, see how nice they are, and we gave a little bit to Mexico, and Johnny, please say a few words.

JOHNNY: Thank you, thank you, thank you, President, great honor for me to be here with you today, President, Vice President, Excellencies, fantastic to announce what you said, which is the final draw of the FIFA World Cup on the 5th of December, here, in the capital, in the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., at 12 noon sharp, it will be broadcast live all over the world, one billion viewers will watch it, and it will determine, of course, the match schedule, the match schedule which 48 participating teams will play, you said it, 104 matches in one month, 104 Super Bowls, it's not just the biggest, the greatest event, not just a sports event, it's a social event as well, with a lot of emotion, we are uniting the world, Mr. President, uniting the world here in America, and we are very proud of that, and those teams, those national teams who will come here to participate in this draw with their coaches, with their presidents, they will all be proud to be part of writing this history, and that's why we brought as well this, which is the winner's trophy, it is the trophy that the winner of the FIFA World Cup wins, only the FIFA presidents, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it, because it's for winners only, and since you are a winner, of course, you can as well touch it.

TRUMP: It's pretty heavy, is the winner trophy. The last one who lifted that is Leo Messi. Leo Messi of Argentina. And here it is in the Oval Office in the White House. Can I keep it? What do you think?

JOHNNY: Well, you can keep it in the wall, Governor. We're not giving it back.

TRUMP: That's serious. It fits well, it's very well on the wall right over there. Let's put it back below the edge. It fits well here. That's beautiful. Yeah, you're right. Until we have to give it to the next winner. That's fine. That's a beautiful piece of gold, I would say. That's beautiful. Yeah. So, six billion Euros for the World Cup, six million coming to the matches, 30 billion economic impact, 185,000 jobs. This will be absolutely fantastic. The biggest event ever. And everything will start here in Washington, D.C. at the Kennedy Center, or the Trump Kennedy Center. You see that? It will be called on the 5th of September at noon sharp. 5th of December, noon sharp.

Then, if I may… Will they be doing most of the draws, all of the draws at the Kennedy?

Well, how are you going to do that?

JOHNNY: Yes, we'll do that at the Kennedy Center. We'll do all the other meetings around it with the coaches, with the broadcasters, everything at the Kennedy Center. The whole World Cup starts, and everyone will be happy because everyone has qualified for the World Cup, and they didn't yet play a game, so they didn't lose yet the game. So, they all think they can become world champions, right? They'll all be happy. Exactly.

TRUMP: Now… By the way, an example. Supposing we had, a week ago, when everybody was being killed and mugged and everything else, despite the phony numbers that were given out, that it was getting better. Brian, do you believe it was getting better or getting worse?

BRIAN: Oh, the crime was getting worse. I mean, I was robbed.

TRUMP: Where? How did the other guy come out?

BRIAN: He came out with our drink case.

TRUMP: That was your drink case? Robber 1, Brian 0. Can you imagine, you do this, and then you start hearing that they had a 20-year reduction of crime. It's worse, it was worse during the Biden administration than anybody's ever imagined possible. And I guarantee you, he wouldn't be here if those numbers continued. But now we have total safety, we have total security. And for the border, in three months, zero people. These are done by liberal people that do these checks. Zero people came through our border in the last 90 days. Can you believe it? Zero. Last year, we had millions of people coming in. And they came in from the wrong locations. They came in a lot of people that shouldn't be here.

So now, when we have this event in December, it's going to be very safe. Johnny, you can walk down the street with your beautiful wife. You can take her to dinner, if you can get a reservation, which I doubt. They're all full of the restaurants. I know. They're all full. I heard that too. The restaurants aren't too… The restaurants, since we are doing this, are doing great. And many new restaurants are going to open, because as you know, many closed. Many restaurants closed, because the crime was so bad. This will be one of the safest places anywhere on earth. So, you know, I really am honored that the National Guard has done such an incredible job working with the police. And we haven't had to bring in the regular military, which we're willing to do. We have to.

TRUMP: And after we do this, we'll go to another location, and we'll make it safe also. We're going to make our country very safe. We're going to make our cities very, very safe. Chicago's a mess. You have an incompetent mayor, grossly incompetent. And we'll straighten that one out probably next. That'll be our next one after this. And it won't even be tough. And the people in Chicago, Mr. Vice President, are screaming for us to come. They're wearing red hats, just like this one. But they're wearing red hats. African-American ladies, beautiful ladies, they're saying, “Please, President Trump, come to Chicago. Please.” I did great with the black vote, as you know. And they want something to happen. So I think Chicago will be our next, and then we'll help with New York, and we're going to help with Boston.

I think, really, I think a lot of — and a lot of these people that you see on television, they are — including the people in this audience — they'll say bad things about me, and then they'll say, “Thank God he's here,” because half of them got mugged, and they don't want to get mugged again. But they're — you know, they work for a lot of — they work for stupid people that are radical left, and they're made to do things and say things that they don't want to be saying. But the people right here are all happy because you're not going to be mugged in Washington, D.C., anymore.

TRUMP: I just want to say, Johnny's been my friend for a long time. He's an incredible guy. And we will lay out the red carpet. Andrew, you're going to be fantastic. Rick is going to be — everything Rick ever touched is — has always worked out. And he's working with me on the Kennedy Center. And his very good friend was an actor on Broadway for five years, right? And I assume he's helping us a little bit, correct?

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Yes.

TRUMP: And, Andrew, you're all excited about it? Absolutely. This is — Would you like to say something?

ANDREW: This is a great opportunity, Mr. President, to show off the first 250 years of the United States of America, the greatness, and the hope and promise of the next 250 years. When you think this World Cup is going to be over, our 250th birthday, Mr. President, your leadership, obviously, with FIFA leading the way. This is the largest sporting event in the history of the world under the Trump administration. So, very excited.

TRUMP: I just want to say one thing. Andrew Giuliani — so, his father is Rudy, the greatest mayor in the history of New York, I think by far. He was — he took a ravaged city, a city that was really under siege. Probably most people thought it wasn't going to survive. He turned it around. He was a great, great mayor. And then they treated him very, very unfairly. You go back and tell your father all of the things that have come out over the last couple of months, through Tulsi and through all of the people — Kash, everybody — they've proven your father 100 percent correct. His father was treated so unfairly. Your father has been 100 percent correct. And tell him we all love him, okay?

ANDREW: Thank you, Mr. President. It's been amazing.

TRUMP: What he had to go through was very, very unfair. Nasty.

These are bad people. Mr. Vice President, would you like to say something?

VANCE: Well, sure, Mr. President. Thank you, and thanks, Johnny, for being here. We're very thrilled about the World Cup. Just to echo something the President said about crime in Washington, D.C., this is the national capital of the greatest nation in the world. And we had murder rates just a few weeks ago that rivaled some of the worst third-world cities anywhere, even in very, very poor regions of the world. Why did we accept that? Why did we allow it to happen?

We allowed it to happen because we had broken leadership in Washington, D.C., and, unfortunately, sitting behind the Resolute Desk. What we have shown in just under two weeks of taking law enforcement seriously is that the American people can have their streets back if their leadership is willing to put in the time and the resources.

So, Mr. President, you showed in Washington, D.C., that we can have safe streets again. We've just got to have the political willpower to focus on the bad guys and to give the American people back their communities. We are focused on doing that. Thanks to the President's leadership. Thank you.

TRUMP: And that's a really very small percentage. It's 2 percent, 3 percent. But that 2 percent and 3 percent wreaks just havoc throughout a community. People are petrified. And I noticed a couple of the women in the back are shaking their head, yes, yes, yes. I won't report who you are because you'll end up losing your jobs. But it's true. It's amazing.

And the police, and you look at the D.C. National Guard. I saw pictures of them last night getting off vans and all. And I saw some bad ones running. But they're not running so much anymore. They're not there. They're just not even — they're not even trying. You're totally safe.

Now, there'll be something happening sometime. I don't know. Maybe it won't be for a long time. But this was — every night, we'd get reports of people being mugged and kidnapped. There's one woman on television last night. She had a badly busted-up nose. And she said, “Well, I like our streets the way they used to be.” And she thinks it's going to happen, like, by doing nothing.

And they said, “What happened to your nose?” She got slugged by a guy walking down the street. Slugged. Her nose will never be the same, I guarantee you, unless it takes a pretty good turn. She wasn't really for us. But she sort of said, “Well, maybe something has to happen.” Before this happened to me, she got whacked. And I don't think she'll ever be the same. She was — she almost became — she was a half-a-Trump fan, a woman that would have never finished on that. But she was — she was hit hard. It's not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore.

But then we're going to beautify the city, too. That's where I was today at Kennedy Center. We're going to beautify the city like it has it. And we're working with Clark Construction, the biggest construction company in Chicago. And — in Chicago and Washington. And the head of Clark is great. He's all over the world, actually. But Washington, I would say, is their home. That's where they do the best work, the biggest work. And they're doing a — they've been doing a fantastic job.

So you're going to have a fantastic, clean, beautiful place. It's going to be better than it ever was before. Literally better than it ever was before. We'll get it done very quickly. And I want to thank Clark, because they're doing a lot of work in a lot of different locations. But they've been fantastically getting us the right contractors and the people that can really do the job right.

And, Gianni, did you want to say something?

Gianni: Yes. One more thing, because, as you rightly say, you know, with security and beautifying cities and the whole country, we want — people to come and enjoy and have fun and that's why this is not just the most iconic trophy in the world of sport but we start on the 10th of September the sale of tickets for the FIFA World Cup. And we have the first ticket here for the final for you, it's of course row 1 seat 1 is ticket number 4547, and it's for the final in New York New Jersey, so you have your ticket already for the final. All the others 10th of September start getting your tickets.

That's beautiful yeah six and a half seven million tickets, fans will enjoy with your security here would be fantastic. 

TRUMP: You're going to do record business I think. Kristi would you like to say something 

Kristi: Mr. President, millions of people will come to this country and we'll make sure they get their travel documents their visas that they want to come here and spend their money and enjoy the sporting event. It'll be the largest event in the world and so you're reminding me of something that my dad used to say all the time when I was growing up he would say Kristi, your kids need to look like you respect yourself before anybody's going to respect you, and in this country when people look at our streets when they look at our capital you're bringing respect back to the city. And people will respect our country more because it's safe, it's clean, it's beautiful, and what you're doing is transforming this nation by making sure that our laws are upheld and millions of people are going to come and be able to enjoy it next year. And I'm excited about that. Thank you for doing that.

TRUMP: Well our country is respected again and a year ago, we had a dead country. I'm telling you it was a dead country, it was a country that had lost its way. It was a country that was going to fail look even today where they say four trillion dollars in reductions of deficits, and this was totally unexpected. I mean I don't know where they've been the people that do this stuff but it's… I want to thank Kristi for another reason. I said to her two weeks ago I said Kristi, do me a favor. I built hundreds of miles of wall. I built the same wall that the Border Patrol asked me to build. 

It wasn't my first choice, I wanted to do concrete plank and everything nice. You wouldn't have been able to see through it. So I had Border Patrol and they tested everything else, then we gave them steel wall high-grade steel very hard to cut. So we gave inside that is 9,000 pound concrete which is a very tough concrete inside that is rebar a big fat piece of rebar. So you have all different materials that are very hard to cut you need different instruments to cut each one. And I said Kristi, we got to get a coat of paint on it, and I didn't know she was listening. But I said we got to get a coat of paint and it should be black because black makes the steel very hot, it's untouchable, you could fry an egg on it. 

And if you got a good black flat paint it would look beautiful, it will preserve it from rust and that was it. And I gave it to her along with 30 other things, and she's done such a good job on the border with Tom Homan and the group. Tom Homan's a fantastic guy, what the job he does and the way they work together. So I turn on last night and I see Kristi's painting the wall and it looked beautiful by the way when that paint went over there.

And it's hot. It's hot. If it's white it's not hot. If it's black it's going to be very hard to climb that sucker. It's not going to be easy but it's black and a high-quality black you know it's really look good. Is that going to be a two coat job or one coat?

Kristi: No, just one coat. We used the paint you told me to buy. The two coat will take place in three years from now. But it looks beautiful but thank you very much I didn't know you were listening. We talked about seven different subjects and all of a sudden I see you're out there painting with a lot of painters and everything else but it was it was a beautiful thing to see.

Would you like to say something? You've been such a big part of this. Please. 

SPEAKER: Mr. President, delighted to be here today for this announcement but we're also looking forward to having you at the finals. On July 19th in New York. We're going to be there. A lot of people are going to be there. 

TRUMP: I'd like to thank you all. Do you have any questions? It's going to be a big event at the Kennedy Center.

REPORTER: Do you have time to take part in it? Will you have a part to play on the soccer pitch?

TRUMP: I might play. I see the money that these soccer players are making. I may try and play. I'm a very good athlete. My son is a very good athlete and he's a good soccer player. He's on the tall side for soccer. He's 6'9″. That's pretty tall. He's on the tall side but he's good. I may put on shorts. I'm extremely good in shorts. Enjoy the play. It's going to be a lot of fun.

REPORTER: Many foreigners who want to come to attend the event are concerned about the visa situation. Can you reassure them?

TRUMP: They're going to have a very easy time getting in. Certain countries are going to be very, very easy and other countries are going to be obviously a little bit more difficult.

Would you like to explain that question?

KRISTI: Absolutely. We have a process set up that we'll be implementing on getting visas approved. Everybody will be thoroughly vetted but they'll be welcome to this country. It'll happen quickly and we're excited for them to come. I would hope that around the world people know that the United States is excited to bring their family here to enjoy this event. 

SPEAKER: America welcomes the world. I can relate from the collaboration that we have. 

TRUMP: I just sent a picture from somebody that wants to be there very badly. He's been very respectful of me and of our country but not so respectful of others. I'm going to sign this for him. I was sent one and I thought you would like to see it. It's a man named Vladimir Putin who I believe will be coming depending on what happens. He may be coming and he may not depending on what happens. We have a lot of things happening over the next couple of weeks. But I thought it was a nice picture of him. Okay of me but nice of him. So that was very nice that it was sent to me. Okay.

REPORTER: Mr. President. Can you talk to Vladimir Putin about the fact that yesterday a big U.S. factory was hit in a Russian airstrike in Ukraine? What's your reaction to that?

TRUMP: I'm not happy about it. And I'm not happy about anything having to do with that war. I said I settled seven wars and actually if you think about three wars add three more so it would be ten. I thought this would be in the middle of the pack in terms of difficulty. Now I'm not happy about anything about that war. Nothing. Not happy at all. We'll see what happens. I think over the next two weeks we're going to find out which way it's going to go. And I better be very happy.

REPORTER: Mr. President. I just made a very good call with Prime Minister Carney of Canada yesterday morning. Actually Canada is taking away some retaliatory tariffs. He's removing his tariffs. Exactly. 

TRUMP: He's removing his retaliatory tariffs which I thought was nice. And we're going to have another call soon. We had a very good call. They're getting closer and towards… I like them. You know, look. I'm fighting for the United States. Canada and Mexico take a lot of our business over the years, over 25, 30 years. Especially during the Biden years. They took a lot of our business. And it's basically all coming back into the United States now. We're hot as a pistol. And it's coming back. And because of tariffs and the incentives we give, it's coming back. And it's impossible, I think, for another country to stop it. And we are working on something. We want to be very good to Canada. I like Carney a lot. I think he's a good person. And we had a very good talk yesterday. So I think it'll be good.

REPORTER: Mr. President. You talked about the search of Ambassador Bolton's home. The Vice President recently did an interview saying that it's about classified documents, but that there's also broad concern about him. What are the concerns?

TRUMP: Well, I haven't spoken to Pam and the group yet, but I will be. I saw that just like everybody else. I try and stay out of that stuff. I'm allowed to be. And I'm Chief Law Enforcement Officer, believe it or not. I don't like to go around saying that, but I am. That's the position. But I purposely don't want to really get involved in it. I'm not a fan of John Bolton. I thought he was a sleazebag, actually. And he suffers major Trump derangement syndrome, but so do a lot of people, and they're not being affected by anything we do. I don't know anything about it. I just saw that. I'll find out about it. 

But if you believe the news, which I do, I guess his house was raided today. But my house was raided also for Mar-a-Lago. They went through everything they could, including my young son's room and my wife's area. They went through her drawers, as the expression goes. They went through everything you can imagine. And when she came back, she looked. She said, she's very neat. She's meticulous. And she looked, and she said, “ooh, this wasn't the way that she had it.” So I know the feeling. It's not a good feeling. Thank you.

REPORTER: Mr. President, how long will you give Putin?

TRUMP: A couple of weeks. We're going to figure it out.

REPORTER: Do you think you'll have to intervene at some point?

TRUMP: Look, it takes two to tango. You understand that. I wanted to have a meeting with those two. I could have been at the meeting, but I know a lot of people think that nothing's going to come out of that meeting. You have to be there. Maybe that's true. Maybe it's not. But we're going to see. In the meantime, people continue to die. I solved seven of them where they were in wars for 31, 35, and 37 years. We had three of them that were for more than 30 years, and I got them solved. And we solved one that could have been a nuclear war with India and Pakistan. That was getting ready to be a nuclear war. I solved them all. And this one, I thought we would have had it done by now, but it's more difficult. There's a lot of anger, a lot of hatred. There's a tremendous amount of hatred there. But we'll see what happens. I think in two weeks we'll know which way I'm going, because I'm going to go one way or the other, and I'll learn which way I'm going.

REPORTER: I've got two questions for you, one on FIFA, the other one on D.C. You talk about the economic impact that people will have in these cities, and what's your message to the mayors to get their cities prepared, not only for the beautification process, but also the safety aspect?

TRUMP: Well, Los Angeles is an example. You know, it's poorly run. We have a mayor there that can't even get permits to the people that lost their houses. Lee Zeldin got every permit. The hardest permit is the federal permit. Within 20 days, every single permit was there for the people to build their houses. But people are writing us, and they're saying they won't give us… The mayor is incompetent. The governor's incompetent. You know, Gavin… I know Gavin very well. He's an incompetent guy with a good line of bullshit. And he doesn't get the job done. 

And frankly, those people want to build their houses. It's terrible. They could have been built. Some of them could have been built already. But think of it, the federal government that has the most complex part… It's the most complex environmental thing to do. We got it… Everybody had it within 30 days. And they're not even close to getting their permits. And now they're talking about taking some of those sites and building low-income housing on them. These are high-end neighborhoods. And I'm all for low-income housing. I built a lot of low-income housing. I know all about 236. I know every program that there is in the government. I used every one of them. I know more about low-income housing than probably almost anybody. And it's great. It's fine. It's wonderful. But you don't build it in Pacific Palisades. You don't build it there. And you don't build it in the other areas that burned down. So…

REPORTER: My second question is on crime prevention. Would you be open to expanding the national concealed carry to apply to D.C. like it does in other states like Texas?

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah. Well, they have it in some states, and they feel strongly about it. As you know, I'm in favor of it. People have to protect themselves. I'm a Second Amendment person, very simply. People have to be able to protect themselves. Especially like in Washington, you walk down the street, a guy comes up and slugs you, and he's got a pistol in his hand. You could be tough. You could be in great shape. You could be a powerful person. Or you could be a guy that weighs 100 pounds with a gun in your hand. And I'll bet on the guy with the gun 100% of the time, right? And so you need protection. So I'm a Second Amendment person all the way. Yeah, please.

REPORTER: President Trump said this morning that you're working with Congress to get $2 billion to help clean up D.C. Have you had any conversations with Mike Johnson and John Thune about where they're going to get that money from?

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Which money?

REPORTER: You said this morning that you're going to get $2 billion from Congress to help clean up D.C.

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah. I've spoken to Mike Johnson. I've spoken to John Thune, the Senate House. And I think it's going to be very easy to get. It's going to be not a lot of money. I wouldn't even know where to spend the number that you mentioned. But it's going to be money to beautify the city. They're ready. Everybody wants to save D.C. In one way, it's the easiest. The violence was more than any other city in the country, actually, by far. It may have been more than any other city in the world, if you could think. And, you know, we looked at some of the worst cities in the world. It was worse. And that's why it angers me to see the mayor saying about how they have it on this side. Not on this side. It was worse than ever. Yeah, we have no problem getting that money. That money will come out of Congress. I think it will be even bipartisan. I mean, I would imagine Democrats would vote for that one.

REPORTER: Is the plan to get it before the September 30th deadline on the Hill?

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I don't know if there is a deadline, either deadline, because if I declare a national emergency, which this was, that ends the deadline. So, I mean, I keep seeing about a 30-day deadline of which we have 22 days left or something. But if I think we're in great shape here, that's one thing. But if I don't, I'm going to just say it's a national emergency. And if I have a national emergency, I can keep the troops there as long as I want. If people are not going to want to have the troops, in 30 days, you know, it's one thing to get them out. It's another thing to keep them out for a long period of time. You've got to train people. You can't do this. You can't bop people over the head. And a lot of those people are in courts right now, going to court. They're going to go to jail for a long time. So that's going to take more than 30 days. But if I have to, I'll declare a national emergency, which I don't think I'll have to do.

REPORTER: Mr. President, if you can spend two weeks, you'll know whether you go or not.

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, I think I'll know. I think I'll know the attitude of Russia and, frankly, of Ukraine. It takes two.

REPORTER: What are the two ways you can go at the end of two weeks, then?

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, then I'm going to make a decision as to what we do. And it's going to be a very important decision. And that's whether or not it's massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both. Or do we do nothing and say it's your fight? Look, I would have never been in this war if I were president. You wouldn't have. You would have had this war. It was never going to happen. This was caused by stupid people that fought. And, you know, people say, well, how do we know? Because for four years, it was never even a subject. And Vladimir knew. And you see his picture right here. It was nice that he said, but Vladimir knew very strongly. We wouldn't have stood for it. It wouldn't have happened. A hundred percent wouldn't have happened.

But it did happen. And now they're losing from five to seven young kids. Think of it. You're a parent and your son is leaving. He's Russian or he's Ukrainian. And he's leaving and they're waving him by. Nice, beautiful kid. Nice crew cut. All set. He wants to be a soldier. And he goes there. First week, he has his head blown off. And he's no different than you people, me. And it doesn't matter where. I mean, I saw I solved a problem in the Congo that was vicious. Rwanda and the Congo, the Republic of the Congo. And they were fighting for 31 years. And it was machetes. People were getting their heads chopped off. I was going over 31 years. I got it solved. You saw it. They came to the White House and we signed an agreement. It was amazing. People can't believe we got it done. I love to stop killing. I really do. People thought it would be just the opposite. Hillary Clinton said, “Oh, he'll get us into a war.” No, I'm getting everybody else out of wars.

REPORTER: Do you think it's a real possibility then that he'd do nothing if Putin doesn't come to the table for a ceasefire?

PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'll see who's fault it is. If there are reasons why, I'll understand that. I know exactly what I'm doing. We're going to see whether or not they have a meeting. That'll be interesting to see. And if they don't, why didn't they have a meeting? Because I told them to have a meeting. But I'll know in two weeks what I'm going to do. Pretty good idea.

REPORTER: The House Department is also sending some of the Epstein files over to the House Oversight Committee today. Are you in support of them releasing all of them?

PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'm in support of keeping it open. People shouldn't be hurt, but I'm in support of keeping it totally open. I couldn't care less. You've got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don't deserve to be people, because he knew everybody in Palm Beach. I don't know anything about that, but I have said to Pam and everybody else, give them everything you can give them, because it's a Democrat hoax. It's just a hoax. The whole Epstein thing is a Democrat hoax. So we had the greatest six months, seven months in the history of the presidency, and the Democrats don't know what to do, so they keep bringing up that stuff.

But it affected them. Bill Clinton was on his plane and went to the island supposedly 28 times. I don't want to bring that up, frankly. You have Larry whatever his name is, Summers, the head of Harvard, who was Jeffrey Epstein's best friend. Nobody ever talks about that. But I don't want to hurt Larry Summers, but he was best friends with Jeffrey Epstein. No, this is a Democratic hoax to try and get the significance of what we've done over the past seven months. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. They say it's number one in history, what we've done, including stopping seven wars. I mean, just include that. And now you look at the stock market today,

It's way up to start off with from where I took it. And this market was going to crash. If Joe Biden or Kamala were president, this market, we would have had a crash like in 1929. You're not going to have that. It's only a question of how high is it going to go? You know, I had the strongest economy in the history of our country. And despite COVID, we have the strongest economy in the history of our country. And we're going to blow it away this time. I was always good at making a lot of money. And whether it was for myself or whether I like doing it this way better. I mean, I like making it for the country.

Our country has been ripped off by friend and foe, nations all over the world, ripped off. And the friends have been much worse than the foes, for the most part. And they're not ripping us off. We just signed a deal with the European Union. They're paying us essentially $950 billion, like a signing fee. They're going to buy $750 billion worth of energy. They weren't buying much of our energy there. And they're very smart in doing it.

And as you know, Ursula was here a couple of days ago, having to do with the people, the leaders that we had agreed. People said they'd never seen anything like it. Well, we had the leaders of Europe right here in the Oval Office. And she's so happy that she has an agreement. But people aren't ripping us anymore. We're run by… This country is run by smart people now.

REPORTER: Mr. President, I have two questions. One is about himself. You have been reported that you're considering taking a stake in himself. Can you talk about that? About the 10%?

TRUMP: About the 10%. Yeah, I met a man who was a very nice man, and I called for his removal because I saw something by a man named Tom Cotton, a senator from Arkansas. He's a great guy, a friend of mine, a supporter of mine, a big supporter. I'm a supporter of his too. And he wrote a pretty nasty story about the head of Intel. And I said, well, if that's right, he should resign.

And he came in. He saw me. We talked for a while. I liked him a lot. I thought he was very good. I thought he was somewhat a victim. But, you know, nobody's a total victim, I guess. And I said, “You know what? I think the United States should be given 10% of Intel.” And he said, “I would consider that.” I said, “Well, I'd like you to do that because Intel has been left behind,” as you know, compared to Jensen and some of our friends, NVIDIA, some of the people and the people in…

Because Intel should have never been… Intel was the biggest, most powerful chip company in the world. And then they started leaving. And they started going to foreign countries, in particular Taiwan. And if we had a president that would have said, “OK, you can go to Taiwan, but we're going to put a 100% tariff or 200% or 300% or 500% tariff. Anybody that sells into the United States has to pay.” They wouldn't have left. They would have never left and we wouldn't have.

So, in the meantime, we have people that were, in some cases, good politicians that weren't good on trade. I loved that man, but he was not good on trade. I totally disagree. He allowed the car industry to be taken out of this country. We lost 50% of our car industry. But that's all coming back. It's all coming back. But if somebody would have said that with Intel, we'd be a giant right now.

Now, with that, they've had some bad management over the years and they got lost. And I said, “I think you should pay us 10% of your company” and they said, “Yes,” that's about 10 billion dollars. I don't get it. This comes to the United States of America. And I said, “I think it would be good having the United States as your partner.” He agreed and they've agreed to do it. And I think it's a great deal for them. And I think it's a great deal. He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us 10 billion dollars for the United States. So we picked up 10 billion and we do a lot of deals like that. I'll do more of them.

If somebody has like we have restrictive covenants with Jensen, we have it's NVIDIA. And to unrestrict the covenant. Nothing to do with losing our powers or military or anything because that I wouldn't do. But there are things you can do that don't affect us that actually help us. And if we're going to give somebody a free out a restricted covenant, we have a strong restrictive covenant on certain industries. And I will absolutely give somebody a opening or a restrict to do a lot of business, which is good for us, as long as it doesn't hurt us in a security or military way.

And if I do that, I think the country should be paid because anybody else I have it in real estate where I'll have a deal with somebody and I'll have them restrictive covenant. Then they'll come back and they'll say, “I'd love to be able to build over here, but I'm not allowed to because you have me covered. You have me restricted.” I said, “I'll let you build over there, but pay me a lot of money.” No different. But the country never did it because the country was run by foolish people.

REPORTER: You said Chicago might be bad. Have there been concrete steps that the administration has taken to do that? Or what other cities have done that?

TRUMP: I haven't spoken to them. He's grossly incompetent. I haven't spoken to them. When we're ready, we'll go in and we'll straighten out Chicago, just like we did D.C. Chicago is very dangerous, great place. I built great stuff there. I have the most beautiful building in Chicago, I think. But I hate to see what's happened to Chicago. Chicago was our greatest city, actually.

Bob Tisch, a great friend of mine, passed away. He used to own the Giants, very successful Lowe's. He said Chicago, I think they had their main office in Chicago. He said Chicago and San Francisco, the two greatest cities in the world. Now you look at what the Democrats have done to San Francisco. They've destroyed it. I own a big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco. It's just different. We can clean that up, too. We'll clean that one up, too.

If everything works out, and we've already had calls from other cities, quiet calls. Calls from Democrats, “We'd love you to come here,” because they've lost control of themselves. I'm not going to say it, because I don't want them to lose their elections. But we've had calls from Democrats and calls from people, generally. “We'd love you to come here. This will straighten out the problem.”

REPORTER: In Israel, the families of hostages are opposed to the reoccupying of Gaza. Why is the U.S. doing that?

TRUMP: Well, not all of them. And you have to understand, I'm the one that got all of the hostages out. You got a lot of people out. If it wasn't for me, they wouldn't be out. I worked with Bibi, and I worked with Steve Whitaker. But if it wasn't for me, you would have all these hostages would most likely be dead right now, every one of them.

So they all come up here. They all come in groups of 10, 12, 13, and many of them, and I've gotten to know a lot of them. They're great people. What they had to go through is incredible. So now they have 20, but the 20 is actually probably not 20, because a couple maybe aren't around any longer. It's a terrible thing.

No, I don't like it anymore. I said, you know, when you get down to 20, they're not going to make deals anymore, and they didn't. And then I put out a statement, as you know, that was a tough statement, go in and get them. And they said, “We'll give you 10, we'll give you 10.” I don't know what Israel's doing, but they were willing now immediately to give us another 10.

The situation has to end. It's extortion, and it has to end. And we'll see what happens. I actually think they're safer in many ways if you went in and you really went in fast and you did it. And people can't forget October 7th, remember that. I'm friendly

TRUMP: with all groups. I won the Arab vote in Michigan. I did so great with the Arab vote, remember? I started off at zero. I ended up winning. I wouldn't say the candidate was the greatest, but I would have won against anybody. They're great people. But we have to do things properly. And, you know, I'm very proud to say I got the hostages out. You have hundreds of people that are living now because of me. And now we have that final little group of people. And Hamas knows that if they give them, that's probably the end of their lives. So it's not easy to get. And I know if you're a parent, you just don't care. You want, I want my baby back. They want their babies back. They want their kids back. And I understand that. But I got them out and did a good job. And we're doing everything we can to get the hostages out.

Thank you all very much. Thank you very much. Well, we called him too late for a reason. He should have caught him a year ago. He's too late. You know, we have a stock market that's up a thousand points today. I better be careful because I go out there and I'll see. It's down a thousand, right? But it's up a thousand points when I came in here. We have a country that markets the hottest it's ever been. The country is better than it's ever been.

TRUMP: We have a military that I rebuilt largely in my first term. We had a great, successful first term, but this is going to be even better. But we rebuilt it. We gave a lot of it away to Afghanistan, but relatively small compared to the overall. But I think it was the most embarrassing day and period in the history of our country that they allowed those 13 wonderful people. But it's really hundreds of people were killed. And they don't talk about the 48 that was so severely wounded with no legs, no arms. Nobody ever mentions them except me. But that was the worst day, the most. It just showed how incompetent. Frankly, if that didn't happen, I really believe that you might not have had the problem with Russia. I think Putin was sitting there watching these stupid people running our country and said, this is the time to invade. You know, this is the time. And then Biden made the statement, “Well, he can do a small incursion.” When he said that, it was off to the races, right? When he said he can do a small incursion. Remember that? I was surprised he knew the word incursion. I didn't think he had that good of a vocabulary.

TRUMP: I want to thank everybody. It's very important to me and to everybody up here, the World Cup. And Johnny has been so incredible. I mean, he's really a great leader. I mean, to think, I said, “Johnny, do it by phone. You don't have to come.” No, he said, “I'll come. I'll come.” And he flew all night long to be here and listen to this about how great we're doing in D.C. But he's a fantastic leader. And this will be your most successful World Cup ever. Thank you. It's been a miracle.

REPORTER: Can he win it, Mr. President?

TRUMP: I don't know. I watched some of those teams go. Did they go down that field? I don't know. But let me ask you, what chance does America have of winning?

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Well, the home team always has a good chance to win. It depends on… It's a good difference. No, but… We have a chance. Of course.

TRUMP: Of course you have a chance.

REPORTER: It will barely go into the games, Mr. President?

TRUMP: I'd love to have him. He'd love to. He's very tall. Maybe we could make him a goalie. Goalies are very tall now, right? Goalies are very tall. Well, he'd be a perfect goalie. 100%. At his height, he'll be a great goalie. Exactly. So we'll put him with the Americans.

REPORTER: No, but do the Americans have a chance of, like, getting into the quarterfinal?

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Yes, definitely. No, the quarterfinal, definitely. But then, you know, the tournament goes on with the public 250 years of the United States. They will forget. They will all feel energized about that.

TRUMP: You know, it's amazing. The talent is really great when you watch these things. I went to the game two weeks ago, and it was a big upset. But you look at these people, the way they pass it. It's amazing. Really amazing. It's a great art, right? It's great talent. It is. You know the expression? Will you drive the name? I don't know. I don't know. He's the boss. That's an interesting proposal. He's the boss. Well, we'll discuss that. It's going to be great. I think the American team is going to do well. I mean, I hear it's a great team.

The goalkeeper had a nightmare display in goal and the Norwegian striker was blunt as Pep Guardiola's side were stunned by a ruthlessly-effective Spurs

James Trafford must have dreamt for many years of making his debut at the Etihad Stadium after growing up at the club but when it finally came it was the stuff of nightmares. The goalkeeper made two big mistakes and cost his side a 2-0 defeat at home to Tottenham, completely deflating all the optimism after their crushing opening-day bashing of Wolves.

City made a dominant start, with Omar Marmoush taking the initiative with some very bright play down the left wing. He poked wide of the far post and forced three saves from Guglielmo Vicario but Spurs struck first through a clever break beginning in their area. The move saw Richarlison chase a knock-down and play the perfect cut-back for Brennan Johnson to hit home first time and although the goal was initially flagged offside, it was then awarded by VAR and, from there, Tottenham continued to unsettle their hosts on the break, and especially Trafford.

The goalkeeper arrived late to a challenge with Mohammed Kudus but escaped without giving away a foul or, thankfully for him, a red card. But things got far worse from the unlikely scenario of a City goal-kick, which they decided to play short. Trafford took a pass from Dias and tried to play in Nico Gonzalez but he was robbed by Pape Matar Sarr and it led to a scramble in the area, allowing Joao Palhinha to slam the loose ball in.

City barely knew what hit them and Spurs dominated most of the second half. Pep Guardiola was so desperate he put on Rodri despite warning of the dangers of bringing him back too soon. It made little difference as Bernardo Silva's shot off the bar was the closest they came to finding a way back.

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

One more ATP match remains in North America before the main draw of the US Open kicks off, and it's an all-unseeded final between Botic van de Zandschulp and Márton Fucsovics at the Winston Salem Open. As always, LWOT previews and predicts the ATP 250 final.

Head-to-head: Van de Zandschulp 2-1

Van de Zandschulp, formerly ranked No. 22 on tour, is one of the highest-ranked players to never win an ATP title. His level of play has decreased over the years, but he's been brave on both the serve and return this week. Van de Zandschulp also made the semifinals of this event in 2022, well aware of these courts as he's often gritty in long rallies with his power. He particularly fired his forehand well during his semifinal win over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard on Friday, where he won 6-4 7-5 and came back from a break down in the second set.

Fuscovics, on the other hand, has played far less tennis this week, either due to good fortune or strong play. The two-time ATP title-winner is yet to drop a set in Winston Salem and made it to the finals via a walkover by Sebastian Korda. Fuscovics is a bit less aggressive from the baseline compared to Van de Zandschulp, and he's similarly ranked far lower than his career high ranking of No. 31.

One could argue that Van de Zandschulp is the favorite because of his match play and experience on hard courts. A reminder — he stunned Carlos Alcaraz around this time last year at the 2024 US Open. However, Fuscovics could also be considered the favorite with his aggressive serve and movement, something that works well on these faster hard courts. Fuscovics will have to play to Van de Zandschulp's weaker backhand, often a loopy shot that can be targeted more easily. Fuscovics is also faster than his opponent, and he can work to wear down a player like Van de Zandschulp, who may be out of gas.

This is a 50-50 matchup, but the edge may have to go to Fuscovics, who had more time off, and is simply the more fit player when it comes to a big ATP final. Expect a three-setter, but don't expect a heavy favorite or likely winner.

Prediction: Fuscovics in 3

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have dominated men's tennis since the beginning of 2024, writing one of the most one-sided chapters in tennis history. The two young stars have won 15 of 16 tournaments they entered together since the 2024 Australian Open!

Thus, the Italian and the Spaniard have turned the ATP Tour into a two-man show, with no one standing close to them. The only tournament they failed to conquer in the previous two years is the 2024 Madrid Masters.

Carlos struggled with an arm injury while Jannik withdrew ahead of the quarter-final due to hip issues. Thus, it remains to be seen who will stop them when they are 100% physically. 

JANNIK SINNER WITH ONE OF THE POINTS OF THE TOURNAMENT AGAINST ALCARAZ AT WIMBLEDON.  No words needed.  Just watch. 🤯🤯🤯  pic.twitter.com/hb5B7M8EQ0

Everywhere else, it has been about the strongest duo of current tennis. Sinner and Alcaraz have been on an impressive streak. They have clinched 14 notable titles during their run, including seven Majors, six Masters 1000 crowns and the ATP Finals trophy.

Thus, the young guns have created a rare duopoly that revives past golden rivalries reserved for Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Jannik and Carlos have split the biggest stages between them, with no one managing to end their run.

Their rise is even more compelling when we examine the contrast in their styles. Alcaraz brings explosive flair, dazzling shot-making from every part of the court and a touch of unpredictability.

Sinner embodies calm precision, relentless power without too much effort and icy consistency that places him among the most prominent players of our sport. Together, they elevate each other's rise and push limits few believed possible in such a short time.

The rest of the ATP field struggles to keep pace, and the ATP Race to Turin lists proves that ahead of the US Open. With more glory and history at every tournament they enter, one can only wonder if anyone can stop their run and chase the notable titles against them.

Jannik and Carlos are the favorites at the upcoming US Open. Alongside the title, they are fighting for the ATP throne. The task is simple but challenging - reach one round more than the rival. 

If they advance into a projected title match, we should see another thriller on the most notable tennis scene.

Arab News


NEW YORK/RIYADH/LONDON: The ATP and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund on Friday launched an updated technology platform designed to give players unprecedented access to performance data and analytics.

ATP Tennis IQ Powered by PIF will be available to all singles players across the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time, extending access to as many as 2,000 players on both the ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour.

The system provides real-time scouting tools, video analysis and wearable insights aimed at helping players refine their preparation, strategy and match performance.

Ross Hutchins, chief sporting officer at the ATP, said the platform marked a major milestone for the sport.

“One of the things we're most proud of … is putting high quality data insights into the hands of more players, enabling easy access to information that can genuinely impact their careers,” he said.

“We've also made big strides in the sophistication of the platform itself. Working with PIF has accelerated that progress — scaling faster, supporting more players and delivering one of the biggest technological step changes in the sport.”

Mohamed Al-Sayyad, head of corporate brand at PIF, said the project reflected the fund's ambition to improve sport through innovation.

“PIF's partnerships are designed to address critical needs and leave a legacy of transformative impact, built on a shared ambition to elevate every level of sport on a global scale,” he said.

“ATP Tennis IQ Powered by PIF embodies how innovation can empower athletes. PIF remains committed to driving partnerships in sport to catalyze innovation, expand opportunity and support the next generation of talent.”

The technology was first launched in 2023 in collaboration with Tennis Data Innovations and TennisViz.

The updated version broadens access to all ATP coach members as well as players and introduces an upgraded interface, enhanced scouting and video tools, and integration with wearables to capture physical performance data.

The ATP said these enhancements would place “richer data and analytics at players' fingertips in real time” to help improve training techniques, refine strategy and make smarter in-match decisions.

The platform forms part of a wider strategic partnership between the ATP and PIF, which last year became the official naming partner of the ATP rankings.

PIF is also a partner of major ATP Tour events in Indian Wells, Miami, Madrid and Beijing, as well as the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals in Turin and the Next Gen ATP Finals Presented by PIF, hosted in Jeddah until 2027.

Marton Fucsovics benefited from the forfeit of Sebastian Korda on Friday evening

Hungarian Marton Fucsovics moved into the final of the Winston-Salem Open after American Sebastian Korda, the No 11 seed, withdrew before the match at the Wake Forest Tennis Complex on Friday evening.

“Hello everyone. I woke up this morning feeling a bit unwell and I thought it was going to be difficult to play today. It's been three long months of recovery and I want to stay on the right track. Thank you for all the support and love,” said the American player on X.

Marton Fucsovics will play the fifth final of his career on the ATP Tour this Saturday, his first in Winston-Salem. So far, he has won two titles, in Geneva and Bucharest, both on clay.

Earlier in the tournament, Fucsovics, ranked No 91, won against Spaniard Jaume Munar, the No 12 seed (7-5, 6-3), Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut, the No 14 seed (6-4, 6-3), Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor, the second seed (6-3, 4-6, 6-3) and Frenchman Hugo Gaston (6-3, 6-3).

Korda, ranked No 45, beat Serb Miomir Kecmanovic, the No 13 seed (6-1, 6-4), Pole Kamil Majchrzak (6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-4) and Czech Vit Kopriva (6-3, 6-4) in the previous rounds of the Winston-Salem tournament.

Novak Djokovic is ready to return to action at the US Open.

The 38-year-old has not played since the Wimbledon semifinals against Jannik Sinner, which the Italian won 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.

He chose not to compete throughout the North American hard court swing, but the 24-time Grand Slam champion has flown to New York to play in the final Grand Slam of the season.

Djokovic is a four-time champion at the US Open and he will aim to join Roger Federer and Pete Sampras on a record-equalling five titles at Flushing Meadows.

Since the start of 2024, Novak Djokovic has been playing more sporadically.

Last season he played just 46 matches and in 2025, Djokovic played 35 matches and suffered nine defeats.

This year he played the entire clay court season and Wimbledon, but Djokovic withdrew from Canada and Cincinnati.

Ahead of his 19th US Open appearance, the former world number one explained the reason for his absence.

“Obviously I didn't have any matches since Wimbledon. So it is the right term in a sense, but I have put in a lot of training in last three, four weeks,” said father-of-two, Djokovic.

“I decided not to play because I wanted to spend more time with my family. And to be honest, you know, I think I earned my right and have the luxury of kind of choosing, picking and choosing where I want to go and what I want to play.”

There has been plenty of discussion among players and pundits regarding the extended Masters and WTA 1000 tournaments.

Rather than lasting a week, many of them now take at least 10 to 12 days, with some tournaments even hosting the finals during the week compared to the weekend.

Players such as Carlos Alcaraz do not agree with the move, and Djokovic has explained why he dislikes the longer Masters 1000 tournaments.

“To be quite frank with you, I don't enjoy the two-week Masters events anymore. It's just way too long for me. My focus is mostly on the slams, and I have said that before,” Djokovic said.

“But I also like other tournaments. I'd like to play more of the other tournaments, but I just, we have currently informally, unofficially, 12 Grand Slams a year, you know, when you think about it.

“I mean, Grand Slam is two weeks and the other Masters events are almost two weeks, as well. So yeah, it's just not any more prioritizing the heavy schedule as I used to. I'm not chasing the rankings or building up my points or defending, et cetera. I just don't think about it anymore.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Sonay Kartal will be hoping lightning strikes twice at the US Open after commemorating her Wimbledon breakthrough with a thunderstorm tattoo.

The British No. 3 stood as the sole home female player to advance to the fourth round at SW19. Her Centre Court showdown with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova - which became overshadowed by a line-call dispute - was preceded by a ""rumble of thunder"" before the match began.

Ahead of her maiden appearance in the main draw at Flushing Meadows, Kartal has permanently marked the moment on her right forearm with a tattoo depicting a lightning bolt emerging from a cloud.

The world No. 51, who had solicited Wimbledon tattoo suggestions during her tournament run, revealed: ""The Centre Court walk-on, as soon as the gates opened I walked onto court like a massive thunder and lightning moment.

""There was a massive thunder rumble. And when I came off court and actually looked through all the messages and people's ideas, I was like: 'Yeah, that one is by far the standout for me.'

""I wanted something that If you're looking at it, you're not going to know that it's tennis-ee, but to me and people that were in that moment will know exactly what it is.



""It was a big moment in my career. If you ask any British kid that wants to be a tennis player, that's their dream, to walk out onto centre court.

""And so for me to have that moment happen and to achieve that goal and to do it, and then to have the thunder moment, I can look down on that and it takes me into that moment a little bit. That is maybe 15 or 16 tattoos now.""

Brighton-based Kartal revealed her finest showing at her home Grand Slam had elevated her celebrity status to unprecedented heights.

""The day after that match on Centre Court, I was in London just doing some scans, making sure everything was OK,"" she remembered. ""And that was pretty carnage because obviously it was still fresh. I played on that court less than probably 12 hours before.

""So I was very late for that appointment. Everyone was kind of stopping me on the tube and things like that. Apart from that, London, I'm still pretty under the radar a little bit. I think Brighton now, everyone knows who I am.

""There's not much to come out of Brighton, I would say, sports-wise. So yeah, Brighton I'm a bit more well-known. I don't hate it at all. I think it's a good thing. I like it.""

Whilst Coco Gauff has stolen the headlines with her coaching change on the eve of the US Open, Novak Djokovic has delivered his own revelation from within his backroom staff.

The Serbian has endured a relatively tumultuous year in this area, with Djokovic splitting with Andy Murray just months after their shock partnership was announced.

However, that has not stopped him from performing at a supremely consistent level at the Grand Slams, reaching the semi-finals of all three he has featured in.

For most on tour, this would mark a sensational return. Alas, for a man chasing a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title, it's simply not good enough.

Additional turmoil from his coaching staff will hardly help his cause at this year's US Open.

Speaking to Sportklub, just after he revealed which legendary WTA figure he hopes will become his coach in the future, he focused on the staff he currently boasts.

And, in a revelation that might shock most, the man who helped lead him through both the French Open and Wimbledon will not be present with him in New York.

Novak Djokovic revealed: “Dule is not with me now, maybe he will be at some tournaments in the future. I say again, we don't have a contract or a long-term agreement – it's more sporadic; if it suits both of us, we work. Only Boris (Bošnjaković) is with me.”

The 38-year-old spent many years with Dušan Vemic at his side before they went their separate ways, yet have continued to reunite on occasion. Upon his return after the Murray departure, it was always going to be just a short-term reunion.

However, perhaps the most interesting claim that came from this interview was about Djokovic's coaching future rather than the present.

After all, he insisted that he hopes that Monica Seles, a nine-time Grand Slam champion who retired in 2008, will one day join his staff.

He claimed: “I love Monica.

“I'm laughing because it's like you're reading my mind, but I can't tell you anything. 

“These are initial discussions, it's more about emotions than a long-term collaboration. It would mean a lot to me.”

The reimagined US Open mixed doubles tournament came to an end on Wednesday night, with defending champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori lifting the trophy again. The Italian duo were the only doubles specialist pair in the 16-team field after the event organisers made huge changes, encouraging top singles stars to compete.

Entries were based on singles rankings, a fast-four scoring format was used until the final, and a staggering £743k ($1million) prize was on offer for the champions, compared to £149k ($200k) last year. Players are now questioning whether other Grand Slam tournaments, including Wimbledon, could follow suit.

Casper Ruud, who finished runner-up alongside Iga Swiatek, said: “I guess they have their eyes open. Let's see. It was a bold move from the US Open to do this. I know it created a lot of reaction. Tennis hasn't done much to the rules or the system in many, many years. So why not try something else?”

Should Wimbledon ever move away from the traditional mixed doubles format, there would be a lot to consider.

Most importantly, the grass courts need maintenance to ensure they can last for the entire two-week tournament. Adding even just two days to the programme for mixed doubles in the week before Wimbledon gets underway could be detrimental.

It took a lot for the All England Club to drop the ‘Middle Sunday' and play a full two-week schedule. “Centre Court is the one that gets played on the most because it's used every day. And to have it in the best possible condition for the final weekend, it was a big decision to go to 14 days,” AELTC board member Tim Henman previously explained.



The entry requirements for the US Open mixed were controversial - reigning champions Errani and Vavassori were the only team of doubles specialists to get a wildcard.

But they proved that experience conquers entertainment, successfully defending their title and declaring: “This one is for all the doubles players that couldn't play this tournament.”

Should other Slams revamp their mixed doubles offerings, they could consider extending the field or allowing more doubles players to compete. “Maybe you can put also the narrative about singles against doubles,” Vavassori suggested.

The scoring format is another element that may need some work. Much was made of British No.1 Emma Raducanu's blockbuster partnership with five-time Major winner Carlos Alcaraz. But they spent just 51 minutes on court before going out to Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula 4-2 4-2.

There was no denying that the exciting pairings attracted fans to Arthur Ashe Stadiums, with the stands packed throughout the two-day event. If regular set scoring had been used, Raducanu and Alcaraz would have had time to fight back from a break down and given the fans more tennis to watch.

The prize money would also need to be high enough to entice the biggest stars to compete. Katerina Siniakova and Sem Verbeek shared £135k for winning Wimbledon this year - and the purse would need to increase almost tenfold to match the prize in Flushing Meadows

And, put simply, one of Wimbledon's biggest concerns would be going against tradition. The tournament is known for its rich heritage, and the All England Club takes great care when introducing new innovations.

But a new format wouldn't be entirely out of the question. When automatic line calling was brought in this year, CEO Sally Bolton reminded fans: “Wimbledon has always balanced heritage and tradition with innovation.”

For now, Vavassori and Errani will enjoy their huge prize - and the satisfaction of proving that doubles is still an important specialism in its own right.

Emma Raducanu has challenged Wimbledon to replicate the new and revamped US Open approach to the mixed doubles tournament - which took place before the singles draw begins on Monday.

The former champion at Flushing Meadows teamed up with Carlos Alcaraz as a number of the biggest names in the sport took part when they would usually bypass the chance to play doubles. Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud as well as Daniil Medvedev and Mirra Andreeva also competed.

The bigger names were able to attract far greater attention and, as a result, prize money. Italian mixed doubles specialists Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori beat Swiatek and Ruud in the final.

Fans who would otherwise turn a blind eye to the mixed doubles chose to watch and Raducanu thinks the remaining three Grand Slams should look to follow suit.

The 22-year-old said: “I think it would be so fun if all the Slams got involved and did something similar, even if it was not the exact same format. I think it was a huge success. I think so many fans got involved, so many people watched and tuned in. It got a lot of attention. I think it was a great idea. And, yeah, I had a lot of fun on the court playing with Carlos.”

Raducanu's partnership with Alcaraz only lasted two sets and 50 minutes, but attracted huge attention. However Jamie Murray was among those to heavily criticise the US Open's approach with the usual tennis scoring system thrown out the window. Instead matches were best-of-three contests with each set played to four games.

Murray, himself a mixed doubles champion at the All England Club, was not a fan of the format and also claimed that the influx of more headline names prevented the usual doubles players from competing and earning prize money.

""It was more of an exhibition in my eyes, I think maybe a lot of people's eyes,"" he told the Sports Agents podcast. ""But I think just more the fact that it was so closed off and it was invite only was frustrating for a lot of players.

""They've pumped a lot of money into it, which is great for those guys that get the opportunity to play, but they're also the ones that are making a fortune the rest of the year.

""The prize money gap in Grand Slams between singles and doubles is more than 90:10, so it's already sort of massive… If you're watching the golf, for example, and a guy's got a putt from four feet for $1 million, and then you turn the channel and the guy's got a putt from four feet for $20,000 – what are you going to watch?""

Emma Raducanu has urged Wimbledon to launch an all-star mixed doubles tournament following the ""huge success"" of the groundbreaking event at this week's US Open.

The British No. 1 suffered defeat in her sole match alongside fellow US Open champion Carlos Alcaraz against Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula.

The only established doubles partnership - Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori - secured the $1 million top prize from the singles stars. And not without that point being made.

However, the innovative 16-team tournament proved enormously popular with spectators in the venue and across social media platforms, ensuring its return to Flushing Meadows in coming years.

""I think it would be so fun if all the Slams got involved and did something similar, even if it was not the exact same format,"" Raducanu commented.

""I think it was a huge success. I think so many fans got involved, so many people watched and tuned in. It got a lot of attention. I think it was a great idea. And, yeah, I had a lot of fun on the court playing with Carlos.""

Ahead of the season's final Grand Slam, Raducanu has named Spaniard Francis Roig as her new coach, replacing interim coach Mark Petchey.

The 2021 US Open winner believes her final Wimbledon encounter against Aryna Sabalenka convinced Rafa Nadal's former mentor to accept the position.



""After Wimbledon, we always knew it was going to be difficult to keep things going forward with his commitments and everything,"" she said. ""It was quite a good match with Aryna. I think quite a lot of people watched it. I think it helped my case, so I'm happy about that.

""After that, I just asked (agent) Jill (Smoller), who is looking after me, and I was like: 'Oh, do we have any more ideas?' Because ideally I wanted to come into the U.S. swing knowing I had someone in a coach. That's how it happened.

""We arranged a few days before I came out to America. Yeah, it went well, but he couldn't start until Cincy. Since then we have been practicing and working well.""

Fran Jones has mirrored Raducanu's achievement of advancing through US Open qualifying without losing a single set after copying Carlos Alcaraz's pre-tournament trip to Ibiza.

Britain's No. 4 received instant congratulations from close pal Raducanu upon securing her maiden main draw berth in New York.

Raducanu also swept through three qualifying rounds without dropping a set in 2021 - before claiming another seven victories in the main event - to become the first qualifier ever to capture a Grand Slam crown.

""What she did I don't think will ever be repeated but I'll be happy to fall into some of those footsteps for sure,"" Jones laughed. ""She said good luck before the match and texted her congratulations just now. We speak every day.""

The 24-year-old Jones enjoyed a Balearic getaway like the Spanish sensation before making the transatlantic journey. ""I thought I'd try the Alcaraz strategy so I went to Ibiza for a few days,"" she said.

""It worked. So we can't complain can we?""

The most recognizable faces in tennis are expected to be on display for the full two weeks of the 2025 US Open.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz appear headed for their third straight meeting in a major tournament final.

A run to the final is the minimum expectation for Aryna Sabalenka, who enters New York with five consecutive appearances in hard-court major finals.

Iga Swiatek is the oddsmakers' favorite to win the women's draw, but she is the most vulnerable of the top two seeds in both draws.

A slew of top American talent will try to upset the favorites in their home major, but a strong case can be made for each final to pit No. 1 versus No. 2.

The winners of the men's and women's singles events will each take home $5 million in prize money. The runner-up brings in $2.5 million.

Bracket Predictions

The men's singles draw seems too easy to predict. 

Sinner and Alcaraz met in the French Open and Wimbledon finals. Sinner also won the Australian Open to start the 2025 major season. 

Sinner is the top seed and the reigning champion in New York. He also has a much easier draw than Alcaraz to reach the final.

Alcaraz might have to get through at least two of Novak Djokovic, Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton to reach the championship match. 

Alcaraz reached at least the quarterfinal round in three of his four US Open appearances. He might play with a little extra motivation in New York after he experienced a rare second-round exit in 2024. 

Fritz, Shelton and a few others could reach the final with an incredible two weeks, but on paper, Sinner and Alcaraz have to be viewed as the favorites. 

On the women's side, Sabalenka is a near lock to reach the final given her track record on hard courts. 

Sabalenka is the reigning US Open champion and she's won three of the last five hard-court majors. 

The top seed in 2025 lost just one set on the way to the title as the No. 2 seed a year ago. 

If Sabalenka isn't in the final, it will be a massive surprise. 

Swiatek's had more variance in her career on hard courts. She's made it past the quarterfinals once in New York and she has two semifinal appearances in seven Australian Opens. 

Australian Open winner Madison Keys and Coco Gauff reside in Swiatek's side of the draw. Both Americans are more than capable of beating Swiatek on the hard-court surface. 

Keys is a three-time US Open semifinalist and she excels on the hard court, while Gauff has had more early exits than long runs in New York so far in her career. 

A Keys-Sabalenka rematch from Melbourne could very well be in the cards if Keys finds the same form she did down under earlier this year.

Game. Set. Love match. 

The US Open is serving more than just tennis this year, on and off the court, with WAGs, player romances and even a juicy potential love triangle straight out of the movie “Challengers.”

The intrigue reached fever pitch this week when 2021's US Open women's champ, Emma Raducanu, teamed up with men's No. 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz — whom the internet very much want to be more than just friends. The duo faced off in a mixed doubles match against Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper … who Raducanu was formerly linked to.

Grab a honey deuce and tune in: Here are the hottest doubles to watch out for at Forest Hills' USTA  Billie Jean King National Tennis Center over the next two weeks.

Blame tennis bad boy Nick Kyrgios for all the rumors about Alcaraz, the 22-year-old Spanish sensation, and Brits Raducanu, 22. and Draper, 23.

Advertisement

“I don't know, I think it's a love triangle,” Kyrgios said on the podcast talkSport Daily in July. 

“Draper, Alcaraz, Raducanu,” he added. “They're fighting over Raducanu.” 

Raducanu, who made history for her 2021 US Open win, fanned the flames even more when she gushed about her “great connection” with Alcaraz — whom she was seen cheering on at Wimbledon in June — to the Guardian.

“I did start hearing rumors about Emma and Carlos last year. This year, with them playing together, it amplified the rumors,” Maria-Isabelle Parada, a tennis expert who runs the sports content account, SportsGirlsNYC, told The Post of the pair's mixed-doubles match that happened Tuesday.

The crowd erupted in cheers as the two took their chemistry on the court, embracing, bumping fists and laughing throughout the match.

So much so, fans began to speculate if sparks were flying off their rackets.

“Am I watching the start of a love story?” one person wrote on X.

“I think this could be tennis' hottest new couple,” another said.

Alcaraz further fueled speculation when he posted an image of himself hugging Raducanu on the court with the caption “That was fun.” 

“Carlitos posted about the match right after it ended, and then Emma posted two days later … Everybody is like, ‘Oh my god.' Carlos is not the type of person to post with a woman. The fact that he did is a big deal,” Parada said. “People were like, ‘They were having so much fun they didn't realize they lost the match.'”

Indeed, they lost 4-2, 4-2 to Britain's Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper — who Raducanu was previously linked to, setting up love-triangle comparisons to the tennis-world movie “Challengers.”

And observers were quick to remark that Draper and Raducanu, who grew up together, shared an uncomfortable-looking embrace at the net after the face off.

Draper has insisted he and Raducanu are just good friends, while neither she nor Alcaraz have confirmed anything. But fans are set on a trophy romance.

Lorenze has been linked to a slew of famous men, including country singer Morgan Wallen, NHL player Kasperi Kapanen, former “The Bachelorette” contestant Tyler Cameron Paul and, notoriously, actor Armie Hammer — who she claimed branded his initials onto her hip. (“I wouldn't say ‘brand,'” Hammer has responded.)

Advertisement

But this July, Paul (men's tennis' No. 14), 28, put a ring on the 27-year-old influencer with a Nantucket beach engagement. 

“Forever,” Lorenze, who runs the apparel line Dairy Boy, captioned a montage of photos from the big day — including a shot of an eye-popping emerald-cut diamond ring. 

While they're in apparent bliss, there may be some troubles on tour. Fans have speculated over a rumored feud between Lorenze and fellow WAG Morgan Riddle, the girlfriend of tennis pro Taylor Fritz, after they noticed last year that the women stopped following each other on Instagram.

Paul added fuel to the speculation when he appeared to unfollow Riddle as well.

These two have Shelton's rival to thank for playing Cupid.

After Shelton, 22, and Rodman, 23, went public with their romance on social media this spring, fellow tennis pro Frances Tiafoe claimed he was the one responsible for introducing them. 

“By the way, I don't think people realize, I was like, the one who [connected them] — if we're going to be real. I'm happy for him man,” Tiafoe told the Overtime Tennis TikTok account about Shelton, who is also a pal.

Rodman — a star forward who plays for the Washington Spirit women's soccer team — and Shelton made their big reveal with a mirror selfie of her kissing his cheek.

“There were never signals on social media and then just a hard launch,” Parada told The Post.

They've since posted several photos of their PDA even as both are constantly working.

“Rodman does a good job of incorporating soccer fans into the tennis world. She's a great soccer player. She's on season, but she does her best to support Ben,” Parada added.

Minnesota native Morgan Riddle, 28, carved out a niche for herself as an internet personality, and professional tennis tour girlfriend cheering on her beau of five years, Taylor Fritz.

Riddle met Fitz, who is ranked No. 4 in the world by the Association of Tennis Professionals, on the celebrity dating app Raya in 2020.

“The pandemic had just started. I was just like, ‘I don't really want to jump into anything,' but he was pretty persistent,” she previously told The Post, noting that she wasn't even aware that the California native, who is worth around $10 million, was an athlete.

“I had seen a photo on his profile of him playing tennis, but I just assumed that it was a college team,” she told The Post in 2023. 

And she's been by his side ever since, supporting her man's biggest professional achievements — like competing in the 2025 Wimbledon Championships in London. 

Fritz scored 10 ATP singles titles, including the 2022 Indian Wells Open.

These two have been through a lot together, considering they have dated for a decade — starting when she was just 18 and he was 17, after being introduced by a mutual friend.

Tiafoe, a Maryland native, turned pro around the time they first got together and his career has skyrocketed, with 39 Grand Slam wins and a semifinals near-miss at the 2022 US Open.

Broomfield, a Canadian, played tennis at UCLA and was Saniyya Sidney's body double when the actress played Venus Williams in the movie “King Richard.”

Since then, Broomfield has mostly become a professional WAG, joining Tiafoe on the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) circuit and, as W magazine reported, hiring a cameraman to follow her around and posting about “many of the tour's more glamorous moments: dinners thrown by tournament sponsors, makeup routines for Grand Slams, meeting Justin and Hailey Bieber at the US Open.”

The pair celebrated history together earlier this year when Broomfield posted an Instagram tribute to Big Foe's biggest accomplishments over the years — and he commented, “Man to think how far we've come. 2015 meeting you … and also just starting my career. You've rocked with me thru it all.”

Greek ace Stefanos Tsitsipas (No. 28) and Paula Badosa (No. 16) of Spain have a hot-and-cold history.

The pair went public with their romance in 2023, spawning the fan nickname “Tsitsidosa.” But they split up last May — only to find their way back to each other the next month, keeping fans on their toes.

They parted ways again in July, after their first round of Wimbledon, both blaming the demands of the all-consuming sport. It likely doesn't help that Tsitsipas, who was once ranked No. 3 in the world, in 2021,has struggled of late.

“They take their jobs so seriously. It's hard. With the tennis season, they're always traveling” — and not necessarily to the same places, Parada said. “With Taylor [Fritz] and Morgan [Riddle], it works out because she's an influencer. She can travel everywhere he goes.”

All eyes will be on the two, who have unfollowed each other on social media, to see if they meet up during the US Open for a possible third round of romance.","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}","tennis"

U.S. Open

The U.S. Open begins Sunday in New York City, and the draws for the men's and women's singles have thrown up some blockbuster first-round matches.

The Athletic's tennis writers, Matthew Futterman and Charlie Eccleshare, analyze an intriguing draw, as well as offering some of their picks for the best matches of the opening days.

The main question for Novak Djokovic, comfortably the third-best player at the Grand Slams for the past year, was always going to be which order he would have to play the two guys above him.

When those two have been as dominant as Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, who have shared the past seven majors, that's especially the case.

So for Djokovic, cast back in the role of men's tennis's “third man,” all eyes were on whether he would end up in the Sinner half of the draw or the Alcaraz one. Given their head-to-head record, he will surely be happier with Alcaraz — especially as he would not meet the Spaniard until the semifinals. Djokovic's No. 7 seeding meant he could have played Alcaraz as early as the quarters, as he did at the Australian Open seven months ago.

Djokovic won on that occasion, as he did in last year's Olympic final. The world No. 1, by contrast, dispatched Djokovic in straight sets at Roland-Garros and Wimbledon, and seems a more reliable bet to reach the latter stages of the majors.

Alcaraz has been slightly less consistent, falling in the second round at last year's U.S. Open against Botic van de Zandschulp. But he has also developed his serve into a pressure release valve, beaten Djokovic in two Wimbledon finals, and come through two potentially discomfiting matches against physically limited opponents to win the Cincinnati Open.

After being thrashed by Sinner at Wimbledon, Djokovic spoke about not having enough gas left in the tank to beat one, let alone both, of the current Big Two in men's tennis. If someone took out Alcaraz earlier in the tournament, that would be an enormous boost for Djokovic. Defeating Sinner would be an almighty task, but doing so after overcoming Alcaraz looks borderline impossible this year.

Others in the draw might have something to say about Djokovic's progress, especially Taylor Fritz, who would meet him in the quarters. But aside from a mid-match retirement against Alexander Zverev, the only player not named Sinner or Alcaraz to beat him at a Grand Slam since 2022 is Alexei Popyrin. When? Last year's U.S. Open, of course.

Aryna Sabalenka or Iga Świątek, the top two seeds, didn't want Coco Gauff in their half of the draw at the U.S. Open. Especially Sabalenka, who crumbled under the crush of a pro-Gauff New York crowd two years ago. Gauff can become a force in New York, and loves the atmosphere, especially at night.

But right now, she is in a vulnerable moment. Gauff hasn't looked convincing since the French Open final, and now she is reconstructing her serve. She's brought in the biomechanist Gavin MacMillan, who helped Sabalenka fix her serve three years ago when she was about where Gauff is now, double-faulting 20 times every match.

Gauff tapping MacMillan the week before a Grand Slam — arguably her most important tournament as the leading American — could be a sign she didn't think she had any shot of winning this thing, or maybe even winning matches, in her current state. She was ready to take the long view, trying to fix her serve so she can rely on it for 10 years instead of 10 minutes. That process starts now, even if a massive tournament is just days away.

If Gauff ends up in a semifinal against Świątek, she might feel like she has already won, because she will have registered more wins in one tournament than she has all summer, but solving her serve problems could take months. She knows that. Her team knows that. MacMillan knows that. He doesn't tweak and tinker. He re-teaches a repeatable, efficient motion. She doesn't have that. In her mind, getting it as soon as possible is more important than whether she can find a way to beat Świątek in one match in one of what will likely be 80 Grand Slams she plays during her career.

Aside from Sinner and Alcaraz, does anyone have a better chance of winning the U.S. Open than Ben Shelton? Or at least, reaching the final?

Shelton has only lost to Sinner or Alcaraz at the Grand Slams this year. He had good chances to take early leads in all three matches. Then he won the Canadian Open, which Sinner and Alcaraz skipped, making something of a statement.

Shelton, the world No. 6, would face Alcaraz in the quarters. It is not the easiest draw — he might have preferred landing in Taylor Fritz's quarter — but he would probably take it if it means avoiding Sinner. As for Fritz, he may have to go through Djokovic to make the semis and the world No. 4 is 0-10 against the Serbian.

The percentages would suggest all of this is moot. Sinner and Alcaraz are levels above everyone else — but things happen in New York. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal never faced each other here. It's the back end of the season. It's hot and crowded and noisy. It's the tournament with an “if-this-man-should-fall” vibe.

Sinner and Alcaraz are probably going to meet in the final but Shelton might fancy his chances on a hard court in front of a frothy Ashe crowd against Alcaraz — at least, more than against Sinner, who is 21-0 in the last three hard court majors.

Novak Djokovic (7) vs. Learner Tien: The 24-time Grand Slam champion, who hasn't played a singles match since Wimbledon, likely under the lights on Ashe, against a promising young American lefty with a knack for top-10 upsets on his favorite surface. Sign me up.

João Fonseca vs. Miomir Kecmanović: Fonseca is an outrageous 19-year-old talent from Brazil in his first U.S. Open main draw. There are an estimated 500,000 Brazilians in the New York area. This will be loud.

Coco Gauff (3) vs. Ajla Tomljanović: Gauff is beatable. Tomljanović ended Serena Williams' career on Ashe three years ago. She won't be afraid of facing Gauff and 24,000 fans.



The women's draw looks bottom-heavy, with all three of this year's Grand Slam winners in that half. Gauff and Madison Keys are slated to meet in one of the quarterfinals, with Amanda Anisimova due for a rematch of the Wimbledon final that Świątek won 6-0, 6-0 a month ago. Świątek, full of confidence after winning at the Cincinnati Open, doesn't have too many banana skins until that point.

In the top half, Sabalenka will be pretty pleased with the three other high seeds being Jasmine Paolini, Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva — players she has a lot less baggage against than the quartet above, three of whom have beaten her at the slams this year. Sabalenka will want to avoid Elena Rybakina, a possible quarterfinal opponent. Rybakina thrashed Sabalenka 6-1, 6-4 in Cincinnati last week and is not afraid of the world No. 1.

In the fourth round, Sabalenka is slated to meet the big-hitting Clara Tauson, another player who has beaten her this year. Leylah Fernandez might also be waiting in the third round but if Sabalenka can get through that tricky mid-section, she would look a strong favourite to reach the final. For Świątek, she might relish the prospect of facing all these top players and acquiring the match-toughness that Sabalenka might get less of from her later rounds.

Lois Boisson and Victoria Mboko have made good on the wild cards they received from their national tennis federations this year. Boisson took hers all the way to the Roland Garros semifinal. Mboko took hers to the Canadian Open title.

Those achievements earned them the ranking points required to enter directly into the main draws without any charity. Both had to play qualifying at Wimbledon. Mboko survived. Boisson did not. 

Mboko's triumph in Montreal has earned her the No. 22 seed, supposedly protecting her from facing the highest quality opponents in the early rounds — no luck there. The 18-year-old has drawn two-time Grand Slam champion Barbora Krejčíková in the first round. 

Krejcikova has not been in Grand Slam-winning form for a while and has battled injuries the past year, but she won three matches in Cincinnati. This might be a tough ask for Mboko, who could feel the pressure of expectation for the first time.

As for Boisson, can her game transfer to a hard court? She has drawn Viktorija Golubic of Switzerland in the first round. 

Of those just below Sinner, Alcaraz and Djokovic, Fritz and No. 5 seed Jack Draper are theoretically the most likely to have a deep run — not just because of their ranking, but their pedigree, too. Fritz reached the final here last year, while Draper was a semifinalist. Both look entirely at home on this surface and in these conditions.

Fritz appears to have a relatively straightforward passage to the quarters, with the out-of-form No. 16 seed Jakub Menšík the highest other seed he could face before then. He could also face the similarly out-of-form No. 21 seed Tomáš Macháč or Fonseca in the fourth round.

Meanwhile, Draper, who hasn't played since Wimbledon, has some dangerous opponents in his quarter. The exciting Canadian No. 31 seed Gabriel Diallo is his slated third-round opponent, while one of the Italians, Lorenzo Musetti or Flavio Cobolli, could await in the last 16. Draper could also play the huge-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard at that stage. He opens up against a qualifier or lucky loser.

Alexander Zverev is the No. 3 seed but has been unconvincing since reaching the Australian Open final in January. He has Alex de Minaur, Karen Khachanov, and Andrey Rublev as the highest-ranked players in his quarter. Were it not for his ropey form this year, he would be a big favourite to work his way through that and set up a likely semifinal against Sinner. But at present there are few certainties for a player who knows he needs to be more aggressive but fighting his more conservative instincts.

Venus Williams (WC) vs. Karolina Muchová (14)

The most exciting wild card in the draw by a distance, up against a player with a throwback game that wouldn't have looked out of place when Williams made her tour debut 31 years ago. Muchová was a semifinalist last year, and is a mighty fun watch — this should be very entertaining.

Barbora Krejčíková vs Victoria Mboko (22)

After her thrilling run to the Canadian Open title, Mboko is looking to back that up with her first run to the second week of a Grand Slam. A former Wimbledon champion and two-time major singles champion with plenty of know-how stands in her way.

Reilly Opelka vs Carlos Alcaraz (2)

OK, hear me out. I know recommending someone with as big a serve as Opelka's might sound like a wind-up, but he's also the classic “on his day” opponent. Even a five-time Grand Slam champion might struggle — or at the very least, be forced to produce some magical defense.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","US Open star wants Grand Slam rule banned for very good reason","https://www.the-express.com/sport/tennis/181248/us-open-star-madison-keys-rule-banned","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 11:16:55 GMT","



US Open tennis star Madison Keys has revealed that she wants five-set matches to be banned. The American is irritated by the potential for long waiting times to get on court.

Keys, 30,  the 2025 Australian Open winner, which was her only Grand Slam win to date, is back at Flushing Meadows, hoping to avenge her 2017 US Open final loss, where she was beaten in straight sets by compatriot Sloane Stephens, who is now outside the top 900 players. The world No. 6 will take on Mexican Renata Zarazúa in the first round, starting next Monday, but before singles action gets underway, Keys addressed what she would change about tennis: Ban five-set matches.

Keys says she doesn't like the prospect of following a five-set thriller, which can last several hours. The longest five-set match in history lasted just over 11 hours. It was a first-round matchup in 2010 at Wimbledon between American John Isner and Frenchman Nicolas Mahut.

In comparison, the longest women's singles Grand Slam match came at the 2011 Australian Open between Francesca Schiavone and Svetlana Kuznetsova, with the fourth-round clash lasting four hours and 44 minutes. However, women's singles matches are best-of-three, unlike men's best-of-five.

""Ban five sets, because I don't want to sit behind another seven-hour match ever again in my career,"" Keys said when asked what she would change about tennis. Heading into play next week, Keys is relishing her ""freedom.""



""I think when you win your first Slam, the pressure of winning the first one kind of goes away,"" Keys said Friday. ""It gives you a little bit more freedom when you're playing. Because now you're looking for the next one… but you already know that you can do it and that you have done it.""

The US Open remains her favorite Grand Slam for obvious reasons. This is always my favorite time of the year. I have had some amazing moments here—and some pretty tragic ones—but it's still always my favorite,"" Keys said.

""I mean, being an American, obviously your home Slam makes it a lot easier to be your favorite. But I just love the energy. I love playing on Ashe… It's the loudest, rowdiest crowd that you can play in front of. I think it's really fun.""

Keys says she has learned how to shoulder the pressure of playing in front of a home crowd. ""In my experience, it's really about letting yourself prepare for it,"" she said.

The biggest thing that I have come to really appreciate about my job is all of the little kids that we get to see and inspire,"" she continued. ""The little moments of walking through the airport and having someone run up to you and want an autograph, it really just puts everything into perspective.

""Sometimes the travel is really hard and those are the moments where you [remember] that you get to play tennis for your job. I think sometimes we should touch grass and appreciate that,"" Keys added.

Tennis icon Roger Federer has become the seventh billionaire athlete in history, according to estimates published by Forbes on Friday.

The Swiss star, who retired from the sport in 2022, is now believed to have a net worth of $1.1 billion, boosted by his minority stake in Swiss shoe and apparel brand On.

Having collected around $1 billion in off-court endeavors during his playing career, Federer was tennis' highest-paid player for 16 straight years despite earning less in prize money than rivals Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.

In 2020, he earned $106.3 million before tax, more than any other athlete in the world.

Federer becomes tennis' second billionaire, following Romanian player Ion Țiriac, who won the 1970 French Open men's doubles championship and began investing after the fall of communism.

Also on the list are basketball stars Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and LeBron James, as well as Milwaukee Bucks sixth man Junior Bridgeman. Tiger Woods rounds out the list and joins James as the only players to have become billionaires while still competing in their sports.

Carlos Alcaraz was named by Forbes on Friday as the highest-paid active tennis player over the last 12 months for the second year in a row, having earned $48.3 million. Only Federer, Djokovic and Naomi Osaka have ever earned more in a single year.

Jannik Sinner, who is the men's world No. 1 and whose burgeoning rivalry with Alcaraz is increasingly shaping the sport, is second on the list. He made $47.3 million, almost double the $26.6 million he earned in the 12 months prior.

The Italian earned $20.3 million directly from tennis this year, the third highest total since Forbes' records began, and significantly more than Alcaraz. Only Djokovic, in Forbes' 2016 and 2019 lists, has ever earned more directly from the sport in a single year.

Coco Gauff placed third on this year's list, having earned $37.2 million – more than any other female athlete over the last 12 months.

Her placement means that – for the first time since Federer, Maria Sharapova and Nadal in 2010 – each of the top three are under 30.

In total, the top 10 highest earners made a combined $285 million, up 16% from last year but still significantly less than the record of $343 million in 2020.

Being Better At Slowing Down Makes You FASTER?! | F1 Car vs Road Car | Aramco

Iconic Nico Rosberg onboards

With the summer shutdown coming to an end, how have the drivers been spending their time away from racing? Take a sneak peek into the life of the drivers off-grid...

The summer shutdown has offered the perfect opportunity for the drivers to reset and recover after a relentless first half of the season. With the next chapter kicking off in Zandvoort from August 29-31, the time away from the paddock has been invaluable.

For drivers, quality downtime is just as important as training and competition, as it provides a chance to switch off and recharge, so they can return at their very best.

Each driver has chosen their own way to maximise their break; some sought thrills away from the circuit, many embraced family time or total disconnection, whilst some kept their fitness ticking over through training. Here's how the grid made the most of their summer before the racing resumes.

After months of hard racing on land, it's no surprise some drivers chose to escape the roads altogether. A number of them chose to swap tarmac for crisp blue seas, spending their downtime unwinding aboard luxury yachts.

George Russell, Charles Leclerc, and Alex Albon all enjoyed time with their partners on the water, combining relaxation and quality moments with loved ones.

Esteban Ocon also spent quality time with family and friends out on the sea, while Kimi Antonelli went on a getaway to Greek waters with close friends and family, making the most of the downtime.

Back on dry land though, Oscar Piastri chose to celebrate the break in true Aussie style by firing up the BBQ with his McLaren team ahead of an exciting news reveal...

Some drivers (and their furry friends) found themselves in the spotlight this summer for reasons beyond the circuit. Piastri delivered exciting news for his home fans: from 2026, he'll have his very own grandstand at the Australian Grand Prix.

Meanwhile, Pierre Gasly kept fans guessing with a cryptic post hinting at the launch of a potential new brand, sparking plenty of intrigue online.

Lewis Hamilton and his companion Roscoe took centre stage in a special feature for Vogue... or “Dogue”, as Roscoe's fans know it.

Even during the break – whether in the water or not – the drivers know how to make waves!

Of course, for F1 drivers, the adrenaline of racing is something they crave. So, it's unsurprising that several drivers found ways to chase the feeling elsewhere over the summer. Max Verstappen took to the water on an eFoil, whilst gaming fan Lando Norris immersed himself in the virtual world by heading to the Esports World Cup.

Some drivers couldn't wait to get back in the driver's seat though. Gabriel Bortoleto got a taste of high-octane fun when taking his partner for a spin in a stock car, while Ollie Bearman helped his GB3-driving brother Thomas celebrate his birthday. How you ask? Behind the wheel of course!

The 2025 grid clearly knows how to keep their pulses racing even when away from the F1 circuit.

Even during the summer shutdown, keeping active was high on the agenda. Championship leader Piastri showed off his skipping skills when in Monaco – perhaps part of his winning formula as he looks to carry his momentum in the title fight.

With so many drivers spending their time relaxing on the water, what about under it? When not on his bike, Carlos Sainz proved there is nothing he cannot do, as he athletically dived down 11 metres underwater amid family time aboard his boat.

Leclerc hit the padel courts, whilst team mate Hamilton hit the weights. And of course, is it even a summer break if we don't see a driver on the fairway? Gasly was out on the golf course, and mixing up his training with a balance of running, cycling, and gym sessions.

George Russell made sure not to skip a workout either, fitting in training sessions while out on a yacht and upon his return from holiday.

The grid proved once again that downtime doesn't mean switching off completely – it's about finding the right balance.

For a number of drivers, the perfect way to relax was to hit 'Do Not Disturb' and leave their phones behind entirely. No posts, no paddock chatter – instead it was time to switch off (the mind and the phone), recharge, and enjoy the quiet before the season roars back into action in Zandvoort at the end of the month.

Iconic Nico Rosberg onboards

In just his third F1 season, McLaren's Oscar Piastri is a firm title contender as he leads the Drivers' Championship ahead of his team mate Lando Norris. With just 10 race weekends left in 2025, the Australian looks back on his year so far and what's to come.

Over the course of 60 Grands Prix – and around two-and-a-half years – Oscar Piastri has gone from highly-rated rookie to standings leader, blossoming into a genuine contender for his first Formula 1 World Championship.

The 24-year-old Australian has delivered on expectation (he had immense success through junior formulae, winning Formula Renault Eurocup, F3 and F2 back-to-back) – and he's made steady and relentless progress since his debut in 2023.

In his first campaign, the McLaren racer twice reached the podium, scored points in 11 Grands Prix total, took a Sprint win and just finished shy of a century of points on 97.

Iconic Nico Rosberg onboards

After joining Kick Sauber as their new Team Principal in April, Jonathan Wheatley is preparing to lead the squad into their transition to Audi in 2026.

Jonathan Wheatley has insisted that he will turn any pressure that comes with acting as Team Principal for the Audi works outfit into “something positive”, with the Kick Sauber squad preparing for the transition in 2026.

Wheatley took up his position at the Hinwil-based outfit back in April, having previously served as Sporting Director at Red Bull, a team he was employed by for 19 years. Prior to that, the Briton started out as a mechanic for Benetton back in 1991.

Since joining Kick Sauber, Wheatley has spoken of feeling “re-energised” by his new role while he has also enjoyed some on-track highlights, most notably Nico Hulkenberg's long-awaited maiden podium at the British Grand Prix.

As he prepares to lead the team into their next era as Audi in 2026, the new team boss was asked ahead of F1's summer break if he is anticipating a greater level of responsibility than he has been used to when the German manufacturer arrives into the sport.

“I don't think so – I think you take these things in your stride,” Wheatley explained to Sky Sports F1. “I feel very comfortable in the role I'm doing at the moment, it's an amazing opportunity. I'm so excited about the project.

“Just saying Audi Formula 1 project sounds like the most incredible thing to be part of. Pressure is part of the job – it's been part of my job for the last 30 years. I turn it into something positive.

“It doesn't really sit with me, I manage to turn it and use it as positive energy and that's what I'm hoping to do next year.”

When pushed on whether he has taken anything from his time at Red Bull into his new environment, Wheatley detailed how he has approached taking on his current role.

“You have to absorb yourself in the team, you have to immerse yourself in it,” he responded.

“You have to listen to what everyone has got to say, you have to try and work out why decisions have been made, why processes are the way they are, and you can very rarely just move a complete procedure from one team across to another – it just doesn't work.

“But what you can bring is a philosophy, you can bring a cultural philosophy as well. There's low-hanging fruit, there's been some of that to be had.

“It's a very young team and I think people forget that. A lot of people here only started in January or February so we're knitting together the team.

“We're on a journey, we're very much in the early part of that journey and we have to understand that we're starting from a humble beginning. I'm excited about it – we're making steps, we're gaining momentum, and of course this business is all about momentum.”

Kick Sauber currently sit in seventh place of the Teams' Championship on 51 points, just one point behind Aston Martin in sixth.

“Harrison's sudden passing is an immeasurable loss to our firm and to the legal community,” Peter Weil, Managing Partner of Glaser Weil, shared in a statement. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	Harrison Dossick, an entertainment and media litigator with Glaser Weil, has died. He was 65. 


	He died unexpectedly on Aug. 14 following a heart attack, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. 




	With a sprawling career of four decades, Dossick worked with clients in the entertainment and media industries. He further specialized in intellectual property litigation and general commercial disputes. 


	Most notably, Dossick represented Angelina Jolie in her 2011 copyright infringement lawsuit over In the Land of Blood and Honey, which served as her directorial debut. (She won the suit in 2013 that alleged she violated copyright on Croatian journalist James Braddock's novel, The Soul Shattering.) He also represented FilmDistrict Distribution in the same year as Jolie's suit (2011) for false advertising claims over the Ryan Gosling-led Drive.

	“Harrison was an exceptional lawyer and a treasured colleague and friend,” said Peter Weil, Managing Partner of Glaser Weil. “He combined intellectual brilliance with warmth, humor, and integrity, earning the trust of his clients and the deep admiration of everyone who worked alongside him. Harrison's sudden passing is an immeasurable loss to our firm and to the legal community. We will miss him greatly, and we extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and all who loved him.”

	











	Dossick additionally represented Paramount Pictures in copyright infringement/idea submission claims tied to What Men Want and Sony Pictures Entertainment in a profit participation and misappropriation of name and likeness dispute over a Basic Instinct sequel. 


	Most recently, Dossick was repping a prominent screenwriter and director in a high-stakes dispute involving a major film project and was advocating for a prominent boxing manager in a commission dispute against a major sports promotion company.


	Dossick has been recognized by Best Lawyers in America (2024-26) and Legal 500 for his work. He, too, was named a Southern California Super Lawyer by Los Angeles Magazine and Southern California Super Lawyers Magazine (in 2006-2010 and 2014-2018, respectively). 


	Before joining Glaser Weil, Dossick served as a partner at Reed Smith LLP from 2012-2023, Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP from 2000-2012 and Hill Wynne Troop & Meisinger from 1988-2000.


	He is survived by his wife, Joanne, and their children, Artie and Carly.

The elder Menendez brother followed Erik's Thursday denial after a long day before state commissioners. But their hopes are not entirely dashed yet.


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



	A day after his younger brother was denied release from prison by the California Parole Board, Lyle Menendez's steady march toward earning his freedom back, 36 years after the two young men shot their parents to death in their Beverly Hills home, suffered the same fate when he was also denied release, a source with direct knowledge of the decision confirmed with The Hollywood Reporter. 


	Erik and Lyle Menendez have been in California's prison system for over three decades now and they will remain there for three more years after separate hearings that were held for both. On Friday night, at the end of a 10-hour hearing, the Board agreed with an assessment submitted earlier this summer that both Erik and Lyle Menendez still pose a risk to public safety.

					Menendez Brothers Appearing Before California Parole Board in Long-Awaited Reckoning		
			









	The parole board hearings came after a protracted legal battle the brothers have undergone over the past year that resulted in their resentencing in May, from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life in prison with the possibility of parole. This made both of them immediately eligible, but this week, their hopes and those of their family and legion of supporters were dashed — at least for now. 


	Lyle entered his hearing on Friday — which was attended by a separate representative from the L.A. District Attorney's office than the rep who was at Erik's hearing, as well as two separate Board commissioners, Commissioner Julie Garland and Administrative Law Judge Patrick Reardon — with the full knowledge of his brother's unsuccessful bid for freedom. In 2022, 14 percent of parole hearings in California resulted in the inmate's release from the prison system; an uptick has been seen in recent years as criminal justice reform has grown in parts of the nation. 

	











	Cited during the Thursday hearing were Erik's involvement with a prison gang in his early years locked up, possession of contraband cellphones, inappropriate behavior with visitors, drug smuggling and surprisingly, the fact that he killed his own mother was noted by the board members. Lyle has a slightly lower number of rule violations in prison over his decades of incarceration and is perhaps more involved in the rehabilitation of his fellow inmates. But this was not enough to convince the parole board that he is suitable for release. 


	Much of the discussion during Lyle's hearing centered around his use of burner cell phones while in prison, and the contraband items may be what ultimately did both brothers in. Erik Menendez was caught with a burner phone as recently as January, when he was well aware of the risk that having it posed to his release. Also brought up by the Board during Friday's hearing was Lyle's plagiarism while he was attending Princeton and the fact that he bribed witnesses to testify using scripts he's written during his initial trial. 


	Deputy Parole Commissioner Patrick Reardon said that Lyle Menendez had a cellphone nearly all the time from 2018 to 2024 — the year the glimmer of the possibility of freedom was first seen. Commissioner Garner notes this when speaking of her decision to deny Lyle's release. 


	“Citizens are expected to follow the rules whether or not there is some incentive to do so,” Garner said of  the brothers quick disposal, mostly, of contraband phones once their paths to freedom materialized.

	











	Phone violations aside, none of these offenses were recent but none of them were countered enough by the good Lyle has done while in prison and the fact that during his resentencing hearing he was characterized by those who spoke from the facility where he's held as a “model inmate.” They were also not countered by the outpouring of support from family members who, over the decades, have come to understand the horrors that took place inside the Menendez house and forgive the brothers for their crime. 


	Lyle on Friday spoke at length about his love for his father and especially for his mother, with whom he says he had a special bond. Erik was the black sheep and punching bag for Jose and Kitty Menendez and Lyle said that he found solace in protecting him. He told the board that he was sexually abused by his father between the ages of 6 and 8 and that Jose started abusing Erik when Lyle was 13, making Erik 10 at the time it began. At one point when they were children, Lyle abused his little brother; on Friday, he was questioned as to why he would do this.


	“I don't know why I did it,” he said. “I think I was just trying to release it from me.”


	Attorneys for the brothers have said that now that both brothers have been denied parole, the legal team will pivot to a habeas corpus petition filed by the brothers at the outset of their road to seeking freedom. This will go before a Los Angeles judge and involve the new evidence unearthed and presented in a Peacock documentary in 2023. In the film, a member of the boy band Menudo admitted he was sexually abused by Jose Menendez and a letter Erik wrote to his cousin affirming the ongoing abuse was presented; both of these new elements back up their initial defense of years of sexual abuse that was not allowed in their second joint trial in 1996 where they were found guilty and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. 

	











	Family supporters, whose loyalty toward their incarcerated family members was hard on for many over hte decades, released a second statement for Lyle after one for Erik was sent out on Thursday. 


	“While we are of course disappointed by today's decision as well, we are not discouraged,” the statement says, adding that the family vows to continue the fight and will find hope in the habeas avenue. 


	The brothers do have one other final chance at regaining their freedom, though, and it hinges on the politician considered the great hope for the Democrats in 2028. Under a 1988 state law, California's governor has a unique power to approve, deny or modify the decisions of the parole board in murder cases where the person was sentenced to an indeterminate term. Now the parole board's decision could undergo an internal review that could last for up to 120 days. At that point, Newsom has 30 days to affirm or reverse the decision, if he so chooses.

The pop icon kicked off a string of six dates at the Madison Square Garden on Friday night (Aug. 22). 


													By
												

	Stephen Daw


Pride Editor


	Dorothy Gale famously said that “there's no place like home.” But Lady Gaga put it a bit more succinctly on Friday (Aug. 22) night: “I'M HOME, NEW YORK CITY!!“


	Mother Monster touched down in New York City on Friday for her first live performance there in just over three years since she took MetLife Stadium by storm with The Chromatica Ball in 2022. But arguably more important was the setting. For the first time in more than 10 years, Gaga returned with a vengeance to Madison Square Garden — the site of previous tours like the Monster Ball and ArtRave — for the first of six shows she's set to play as part of her globe-spanning new tour The Mayhem Ball. 


	For just over two hours, Gaga kept her fans' energy high as she powered through a masterful set of world-dominating hits, beloved B-sides and a plethora of her latest songs off of March's Mayhem, all while delivering a high concept, artfully-crafted live show that embraced the chaos and theatricality of live performance. 


	Gaga even gave fans at the show a surprise performance of “Hair,” her beloved Born This Way B-side as a special treat for the fans in her hometown. “New York, you made me a star, you raised me,” she told the screaming crowd at MSG. “Thank you so much for always believing in me — it's good to be back home.”


	Below, Billboard takes a look back at the seven best moments from Gaga's first show back home at Madison Square Garden for The Mayhem Ball.


	Gaga has never been shy about her love of larger-than-life performance art, and The Mayhem Ball is not an exception. In fact, among all of Gaga's globe-trotting tours, this one likely is the most interested in the artifice of the show itself — along with giving you an opportunity to watch Mother Monster perform the hits live, you're getting a story alongside it. 


	That story, much like the album this tour was inspired by, sees Stefani Germanotta in a soul-wrenching battle with the monster of her own creation, Lady Gaga. Throughout the different acts of this rock opera (the gothic proscenium adorning the stage, along with the bits of scripted dialogue Gaga recites in between, give The Mayhem Ball the vibe of an actual narrative musical), different sides win out. But in the end, the two sides of Gaga fuse into one glorious whole as she finds the beauty in her own personal chaos. 


	While Gagachella was heralded by everyone as an all-time great performance at the annual festival, some Little Monsters were left wanting when Gaga did not perform any of the tracks off her weird and wild 2013 album Artpop. But those fans will be delighted to know that Gaga heard their protests and added two Artpop tracks to the setlist for The Mayhem Ball. 


	First, Gaga lit up the Garden with a truncated performance of Artpop opener “Aura,” immediately prompting fans to squeal along with her as she raved that “Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion.” But one of the most energetic reactions from the crowd on Friday night came when Gaga launched into a high-energy rendition of “Applause,” as the entire arena screamed the lyrics along with her. 


	While Gaga remained largely on-script for most of the show, she could not hold back the tears. After giving a heartfelt rendition of her smash-hit “Die With a Smile,” a stunned Gaga looked into the crowd as her fans cheered her on, before launching into a heartfelt speech about what it meant for her to finally be back in her hometown. 


	“I know that it's me standing up here, but you're all standing in here with me, you know what I'm saying? I feel so honored to be here tonight at Madison Square Garden,” Gaga said, while fans held up signs, including one that welcomed the “Italian girl from New York” back home. “I'm sure you can tell if you listen to the music that I am from here. Everything about my artistry, I think, was born in this town.” 


	The pop superstar also shared a vulnerable story with fans about a conversation she had backstage with her backup dancer China Taylor, where she said that she felt like she needed to fight through her first performance at MSG. “When I'm in New York, I fight,” Gaga said. “But she said something really special to me. She said, ‘Sometimes, you don't have to fight, you just have to show up.'” And show up Gaga did. 


	To go along with her moving speech to the crowd, Gaga also revealed that she had “prepared something special” for the audience at MSG on Friday. For the first time since her Born This Way Ball wrapped in 2013, Gaga gave a stirring rendition of “Hair,” her anthem of self-empowerment off her 2011 album Born This Way. “I'm sure that all of my albums could not have been made without New York, but I am sure this album would not have been made without New York,” a tearful Gaga declared. “This is for all of you, and all your dreams; for maybe sometimes, no more fighting, and just showing up.” 


	Sat at an upright piano at the end of a catwalk, Gaga led the crowd in a choral-like chant of the song, as she offered up the song's central “prayer,” promising that she and by extension her audience would “die living just as free as my hair.” 


	While other albums like The Fame and Born This Way were given their proper shine throughout the evening, this was The Mayhem Ball after all — the songs of Mayhem provided the central backbone for the evening's performance. Kicking off the show with a rousing rendition of “Abracadabra,” Gaga weaved her way through almost every song on the album (only “Don't Call Tonight” and “Blade of Grass” didn't make appearances during the evening). 


	There were a number of standouts among the crowded field of Mayhem tracks. Her gothic, high-camp performance of “Killah” saw the audience join her in a deeply cathartic scream; both “Perfect Celebrity” and “Disease” saw Gaga thrashing around a sandbox onstage; and after running through “Garden of Eden” early in the show, Gaga looked shocked as the audience gave her a minutes-long standing ovation for her unwavering commitment to the performance. 


	In the nearly two decades that she's been making music, Gaga has never been one to be shy about her unapologetic love for the LGBTQ+ community — and that certainly did not stop on Friday night. Gaga spent the show giving nods, but subtle and overt, to the people who helped make her the superstar that she is.


	Sometimes, that meant ceding the stage to ballroom dancers, who cut up the catwalk in between Acts I and II. Other times, it saw Gaga engaging in some not-so-subtle symbolism, as her gigantic flowing train lit up with the colors of the rainbow during her excellent rendition of “Paparazzi.” But of course, Gaga had to make sure that the crowd knew exactly what she was trying to say; before launching into a rousing rendition of “Born This Way,” Gaga made her point clear. “We are here for the queer community, do you hear me?” Gaga yelled into the crowd. “This show was made with love for you, because we need the world to love right now.”


	While Gaga was undoubtedly the star of her own show, you could not help but feel the presence of her biggest fans in the crowd that evening. Little Monsters stalked the halls of MSG dressed in their best Gaga drag, ranging from simple, Mayhem-inspired looks, to full-blown recreations of the characters from Gaga's “Abracadabra” video. 


	For her part, Gaga made sure the fans felt the love on Friday night, too. Along with giving the crowd a new addition to the setlist and a heartfelt speech, Gaga also spent the entirety of “Vanish Into You” performing an impromptu meet-and-greet with fans on the floor. As she walked by her cheering crowd, Gaga stopped to sign vinyls and posters, accepted flowers, blew kisses and even put on a red track jacket handed to her by one of her admirers. As she walked up the catwalk, the whole stadium got to see the loving message embroidered on the back of Gaga's new coat: “Monsters Never Die.”

The K-pop boy band's 11-track album is the follow-up to 2024's ""HOP.""


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	K-pop boy band Stray Kids dropped their fourth full-length album on Friday (Aug. 22), KARMA, the 11-track follow-up to December's Hop mixtape. The collection produced entirely by the group's production team 3RACHA, opens with the yearning, hard-hitting rap-popper “Bleep” followed by the bouncy hip-pop single “Ceremony.”

	The accompanying high-gloss video finds members Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin and I.N kitting up for a variety of extreme sports challenges in a futuristic landscape. From Changbin dropping hard-hitting rhymes in the middle of an MMA octagon — “We're moving forward with maximum power/ And we're gonna dominate, pop it/ Making headlines, big news topic/ My experience points are my countless trophies” — to a Mario Kart-esque race to grab an elusive black ball in a raucous arena and American football players trying to tackle Han as he casually dribbles a soccer ball between them, the visual is full of extreme sports action.

	According to a release announcing the LP, the collection tells a story about destiny from a unique Stray Kids perspective. “Destiny is shaped by a tangled web of choices and consequences,” it explains. “KARMA begins with this very idea — an attempt to interpret Stray Kids' fate. Despite countless external judgments and inner conflicts, they have continued to forge their own path with unwavering resolve. Through their music, Stray Kids represent a story of growth.”

	











	Other tracks on the album include the skittery trap R&B banger “Creed,” tear-stained ballad “Mess,” old school, whistle-enhanced baile funk bouncer “Half Time,” EDM jam “Phoenix” and two additional versions of “Ceremony,” a live-sounding “Festival” version and an English version.


	The group recently completed its largest-ever world tour, Stray Kids World Tour <dominATE>, which brought 54 shows to 34 regions across the world on five continents over 341 days, wrapping up on July 30th in Rome.

The rapper's new album will arrive in September.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Doja Cat is breaking new ground with her upcoming album Vie, from working with Jack Antonoff for the first time to rapping about subjects that she never has before — such as “love-bombing” — on the project.


	In an interview with Apple Music 1's Zane Lowe posted Friday (Aug. 22), the hip-hop star opened up about how refreshing it's been to try out new things on Vie, which is set to drop next month following a period of self-discovery for Doja.


	“I'm working with Jack Antonoff and working with a person that's new in my life,” she told the radio host. “And so it's the grappling with talking about something personal and creating something fresh, and then getting to know someone new, and then all of these things fell together really naturally.”

	“He's just been such a wonderful person to work with,” she continued of the producer. “But yeah, I think it's just been nice to play. I really played through the whole thing … I think what I wanted to do was play with my voice in ways that are a little bit less unconventional. And so I'm shrieking a little bit on this album, and that's been a lot of fun.”




	Doja has previously said that Vie will be majorly pop-influenced, meaning her team-up with Antonoff — who's known for crafting hits with pop titans such as Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter — makes perfect sense. While she was working on the LP, the California native also says that she did a lot of work on herself through frequent therapy sessions re-examining certain things in her life — like the way her exes have treated her in the past.


	“There's other things outside of myself that were inspiring me to write about these things,” the Grammy winner told Lowe. “I had been in relationships that made me think about things in a different way, and I think naivety is a big part of this album too. I speak about rushing and love-bombing in a way.”


	“I think sometimes people don't know that they're doing it or they do, but giving excessive compliments and gifts right off the bat, that sort of thing,” she added. “I thought that was a really fun thing to write about.”


	The interview arrives on the same day that Doja — who was previously linked to actor Joseph Quinn and musician J. Cyrus — dropped lead Vie single “Jealous Type.” The track marks fans' first taste of the follow-up to 2023's Scarlet, with the new album slated for Sept. 26.

CTS Eventim shares fell 16.6% and Spotify shares fell 5.4%, leading the Billboard Global Music Index to a 2.6% decline for the week ended Aug. 22.

	Glenn Peoples



Gains by some live entertainment stocks and solid performances by multi-sector companies were overshadowed this week by German concert promoter CTS Eventim's double-digit decline and a more modest single-digit drop from Spotify.


	CTS Eventim shares fell 16.6% to 81.20 euros ($95.18) this week following Thursday's mid-year results that showed a sharp decrease in adjusted EBITDA despite the concert promoter achieving record revenue. Numerous analysts reacted by decreasing their price targets. The most drastic revision came from Oddo BHF, which reduced its price target to 86 euros ($100.81) from 117 euros ($137.15) and downgraded its rating to “neutral” from “outperform.”

	In addition, Bernstein lowered its CTS Eventim price target to 100 euros ($117.22) from 104 euros ($121.91) and maintained its “outperform” rating. Deutsche Bank dropped its price target to 109 euros ($127.77) from 117 euros ($137.15) but kept its “buy” rating. MWB Research lowered its price target to 100 euros ($117.22) from 105 euros ($123.08) and upgraded its rating to “buy” from “hold.”

	The Billboard Global Music Index (BGMI) dropped 2.6% to 3,023.51, breaking a two-week winning streak and lowering the index's year-to-date gain to 42.3%. Winners outnumbered losers 10 to 8, and one company, Deezer, was unchanged. 


	Major indexes were mixed this week. In the U.S., the Nasdaq fell 0.6% and the S&P 500 gained 0.3%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 improved 2.0%. South Korea's KOSPI composite index dropped 1.8%. China's Shanghai Composite Index rose 3.5%. 


	Other than CTS Eventim, live entertainment companies posted solid gains. Live Nation reached a new record of $166.54 on Friday and closed at $165.72, up 3.0%. Earlier in the week, MoffettNathanson initiated coverage of Live Nation with a $195 price target and Wolfe Research increased its price target to $177 from $173. 


	The two Dolan family-controlled live entertainment companies bounced back from an off week. MSG Entertainment was the week's biggest gainer, rising 6.8% to $39.33. Sphere Entertainment Co. rose 6.5% to $42.46. A week earlier, MSGE shares fell 3.1% after the company's earnings announcement revealed a 74% decline in fiscal year net profit and Sphere Entertainment shares fell 1.0% following second quarter earnings. 


	Music streaming companies produced more losers than winners. Spotify fell 5.4% to $692.99, lowering its gain in 2025 to 48.5%. LiveOne slipped 6.3% to $0.60. Tencent Music Entertainment dropped 0.8% to $25.35, although it's still up 127.4% this year. Netease Cloud Music gained 2.5% to 287.00 HKD ($36.73), bringing its year-to-date gain to 155.8%. 


	Multi-sector companies' stocks performed well, with Reservoir Media (up 5.1%), Warner Music Group (up 3.8%), HYBE (up 0.7%) and Universal Music Group (up 0.6%) posting gains. SM Entertainment and JYP Entertainment fell 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively

	Diego Borella, an assistant director on the upcoming fifth season of Emily in Paris, has died after collapsing on the set of the Netflix show in Venice, Italy.


	Filming was temporarily suspended after the Italian crew member of the Paramount Television Studios production was pronounced dead at around 7pm on Thursday after he collapsed during preparation for a final scene being shot at Hotel Danieli, according to multiple local outlets.


	“We are deeply saddened to confirm the sudden passing of a member of the Emily in Paris production family,” a Paramount Television Studios spokesperson said in a statement. “Our hearts go out to the individual's family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.”

	The show's medical staff attempted to treat Borella, but he died at the scene, likely of “a sudden heart attack,” according to La Repubblica.


	A locally hired 3rd AD on Emily in Paris, Borella previously worked on the medical drama DOC – Nelle tue mani (DOC – In Your Hands) in 2022.


	Production on Emily in Paris resumed Saturday. Season 5 of the comedy, greenlighted last September, started filming in Rome in May before returning to Paris, with a few days in Venice scheduled at the tail-end of production.


	“I think we've got a really terrific season coming up,” said Star last month. “We filmed in Rome for the first four weeks, and that was an exciting experience to be there. Now we're back in Paris, Emily is definitely back in Paris.”


	Season 5 of Emily In Paris is set to premiere Dec. 18 on Netflix.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	We've confirmed that Alex Sohn and Gavin Johannsen‘s spec screenplay With the 8th Pick, about the behind-the-scenes 1996 NBA drafting of Kobe Bryant, has landed at Warner Bros. There is no director attached as of yet.


	The project is told from the point of view of John Nash, the general manager of the New Jersey Nets, and incoming Nets coach John Calipari, who really wanted Bryant. However, the New Jersey was a broke organization, and Bryant was an L.A. Lakers fan. Not to mention, Bryant's sneaker deal with Adidas would be worth more with the Lakers than had he signed with the Nets.

The Social Network has become the most influential movie of the 21st century. It's amazing how much prestige talent this “true stories” have gobbled up.

Who will be playing Kobe?

If they needed to cast someone Quentin Johnston of the Chargers looks so much like Kobe it's insane. Quentin may not be an actor, but he may surprise.

	From femme fatale to romantic leading lady, Margot Robbie finally got a chance to work with Colin Farrell.


	Before her A Big Bold Beautiful Journey co-star's tenure as Oswald Cobblepot, the 3x Oscar nominee almost went toe-to-toe with the DC supervillain when she starred as Harley Quinn in director Cathy Yan‘s Birds of Prey (2020).


	“The first draft that Christina [Hodson] wrote of Birds of Prey, the villain was the Penguin,” she told Farrell in an interview for Entertainment Weekly. “And then [The Batman director/writer] Matt Reeves said, ‘Don't use the Penguin. I'm going to use him in my thing.' And so we swapped it to Black Mask [played by Ewan McGregor].”

	After she last appeared as Harley in James Gunn‘s The Suicide Squad (2021), the DC Studios boss recently said that Robbie's future as the character will be “revealed down the line.”


	Premiering last month in theaters, Gunn's Superman launched a new DCU with the ‘Gods and Monsters' phase, separate from Reeves' ‘Batman Epic Crime Saga', which includes The Batman (2022) and last year's HBO Max series spin-off The Penguin.


	After Gunn previously defended the delays on The Batman Part II, which is set to premiere on Oct. 1, 2027 following a year-long postponement, Reeves and co-writer Mattson Tomlin revealed in June that they finished the script for the sequel.


	In a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders this month, the studio confirmed that production will begin on The Batman Part II in the spring.

As uneven as Birds of Prey is, I'm happy about this choice, as Ewan McGregor's ultradouchebro villain made a perfect foil for all the characters. It's one of the few movies from that era I can go back and get a kick out of.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	A day after his younger brother was denied parole at the conclusion of a grueling 10-hour hearing, Lyle Menendez saw his own hopes of freedom after nearly 30 years behind bars evaporate.


	“The panel has found today that there are still signs” Menendez is a potential risk to the public, declared Parole Commissioner Julie Garland and Deputy Parole Commissioner Patrick Reardon to the older Menendez brother as he participated via video feed from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility near San Diego. 


	After going through the reasoning behind the denial and the violations that Menendez has been cited for while in prison, Garland offered a note of hope. “This denial is not …the end,” she said. “It's a way for you to spend some time to demonstrate, to practice what you preach about who you are, who you want to be.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Following hours and hours of questioning and some chaos, the conclusion Friday by the two-person parole board brings to an end at least for the next few years, the Menendez brothers' hard fought battle the past 18 months to get out of prison after being sentenced to life without parole back in 1996 after two trials.


	With so many members of the family in attendance today, like Thursday, the admittedly disappointed relatives proclaimed “this is not the end of the road.” They went on to say of the brothers: “Both will go before the Board again, and their habeas petition remains under review. In the meantime, we know they will take time to reflect on the Board's recommendations and will continue to lead, mentor, and build programs that support rehabilitation and hope for others.”

	











	Like his brother Erik, who can't apply for another parole hearing until 2028, Lyle Menendez can seek a review of Friday's decision based on factual inaccuracies that may impact the final outcome — but the success of such a move could be a long shot. As it stands right now Lyle Menendez can't reapply for parole for 36 months. 


	Still, after nearly 11 hours, at one point late in the day Friday it looked like today's proceedings might go off the rails as it as revealed audio of part of Thursday's hearing for Erik Menendez has been released publicly.


	“It's highly unusual,” exclaimed Menendez attorney Heidi Rummel. “It's another attempt to make this a public spectacle,” the lawyer emphatically added, calling the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's release of audio without family members' permission a blow to the state's victims bill of rights. “It's ironic to me that we are sitting here for hours talking about Mr. Menendez following CDCR policy, and they are not following their own policy,” Rummel went on to say, asking for an adjournment as she felt today's hearing had lost its impartiality.


	The Commissioners later told the hearing that the state has actually had a policy that anyone who requests an audio file of a hearing may receive it, and 


	As Menendez family members screamed at the Parole Board and the Deputy DA on the screens over the SNAFU, Rummel said “we came into these hearings hoping and expecting a fair and impartial hearing where Mr. Menendez could be heard, be considered and be understood.” The attorney then, seeding what will surely be an attempt to overturn today's decision,  told the hearing: “And we have a public spectacle and this has exacerbated it twenty-fold. And we now have family members who are not going to speak.”


	As has been well documented, then 21-year-old Princeton student Lyle and 19-year-old Erik murdered their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez in the family's Beverly Hills home on the night of August 20, 1989. The brothers, who went back for more ammunition to reload and finish off their mother (which Lyle today like Erik yesterday now says he regrets) as she crawled away already wounded, have long insisted the fatal shootings were because of years of sexual abuse that both of them suffered at the hands of their record company exec father.


	Earlier in the virtual hearing, which formally started at 9:03 am PT today with the brothers' lawyer Rummel (who was with Erik Menendez for Thursday's hearing), L.A. County Deputy DA Ethan Millius, officials from the state's CDCR, and family members also attending remotely, Commissioner Garland praised the allegedly rehabilitation seeking Menendez for  his “clearly heartfelt, well-written, informative” submissions to the Board. 


	However, Garland also dug deep on the relationship Lyle had with his father, the alleged abuse he suffered and then his brother becoming the target of the abuse when Lyle was in his early teens, as well as Lyle's own often undiscussed abuse of Erik. The commissioner also returned again and again to the credibility and truthfulness of the older Menendez sibling – especially in the years after the murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez.


	Looking over the risk assessment report on Menendez being at a “moderate risk” of violence if let out on parole, Garland at one point late Friday, bluntly said that she thought the actual record of his various prison violations like having an illegal phone, were much more “deceitful” and intentional than he was letting on in the hearing. 

	











	Even though Menendez himself called a March 2024 violation a wake-up call (no pun intended, I think) about his conduct, Garland noted he soon afterwards did it again and presently cut off from family visits for the next three years.


	“Even though you fooled your entire family about you being the murderer, and you recruited all these people to help you … you don't think that's being a good liar?” Garland asked Menendez earlier in the day, who repeated his answer in the negative. Citing the various explanations he and his brother initially provided after their parents' death, the $100,000 and more spending sprees they went on, efforts to destroy an unfriendly will and scripting responses for witnesses, and even “escape plans from jail,” the commissioner pointed what she termed Menendez's “sophistication of the web of lies and manipulation you demonstrated afterwards.”


	If that sentiment from Commissioner Garland played a factor in today's denial of Lyle Menendez's parole, the top priority “post-conviction factors” spotlighted by Deputy Parole Commissioner Patrick Reardon in her questioning disclosed a spotty prison record at best from the older sibling. As made evident by Commissioner Robert Barton in his denial Thursday of Erik Menendez's parole for at three more years, the incarcerated's actions in the joint spoke much louder than their words or promises — especially when it comes to public safety.


	Amidst the infractions, for Lyle Menendez, like Erik Menendez, it was illegal cell phones in prison that proved the sticky wicket to his getting out. 


	“I had convinced myself that this wasn't a means that was harming anyone but myself in a rule violation,” Menendez replied as Reardon asked again and again how he could square the repeated incident being caught with a phone he wasn't supposed to have with being a good prisoner.


	“I would never call myself a model incarcerated person,” Menendez exclaimed under questioning. “I would say that I'm a good person, that I spent my time helping people, that I'm very open and accepting.” Harking to previous mention of his Menendez added: “I'm the guy that officers will come to to resolve conflicts …At the time I didn't feel that using the phone was inconsistent with that.” 


	That didn't appear to go over well with Dep. Commissioner Reardon, who followed up with wanting to know why Menendez even needed a hidden cell phone to communicate with his relatives if he already had access to a tablet for pretty much the same purpose. That line of questioning set off a skirmish between the CDCR official and Menendez attorney Rummel about taking things offline so to speak and to discuss the matter confidentiality. 


	At that junction, the hearing took a recess. 


	Upon reconvening, and Commissioner Garland determining the already pretty locked away hearing would not go (further) behind closed doors, the matter of Menendez and cell phones, of which he had several violations over the years, came up again. “I felt like the phone was a way to protect …privacy,” Menendez admitted, saying that because his correspondence on his tablet was monitored by prison staff he believed portions of what should have been private conversations were being sold to media outlets. 


	After Menendez lawyer Rummel and Dep. DA Millius spoke, Menendez cousin and very public advocate Anamaira Baralt addressed the board, like she did Thursday for Erik Menendez. “Lyle has not been a violent person in his entire life,” Baralt said. “He is not a violent person today. In 54 years, I have not heard Lyle raise his voice, not once.”

	











	In a case that up until just a few weeks ago many assumed was a slam dunk on the Menendezs' release, Baralt's words, along with those of other family members, proved no more convincing today than they had yesterday. 


	Increasingly forgotten in the decades after their media circus trials of the early cable age, the brothers would have likely had no chance of even thinking about getting out if not for the much watched success of Netflix and Ryan Murphy's Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story series and some Peacock documentaries claiming new evidence. The Emmy nominated Monsters was seen as a potential political lifeline to incumbent and sometimes media savvy LA County DA  George Gascón as he suddenly took an interest in the case and recommended resentencing for the brothers. 


	Even though current LA DA Nathan Hochman won the race in a landslide last November, the resentencing process as well as an ongoing May 2023 filed habeas petition the brothers have before the courts seeking a new trial were still active.


	Hochman came out against both the resentencing and a new trial – as he restated earlier this week.


	However, the DA seemed irrelevant on May 13 when LA Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life — thereby making them instantly eligible to seek parole. Leading us to yesterday and today, after a delay to allow the brothers to adequately prepare, the parole attempt took the slots offered by a clemency process already ordered by California Governor Gavin Newsom. 


	In an alternative universe, where one or both of the brothers had been granted parole, they would have had to stay behind bars as the Board of Paroles chief counsel gave the recommendation a final legal and administrative overhaul When that is done, which could take weeks, then the grant would be sent to Gov. Newsom for final approval – which the ambitious Democrat could give, reject, or seek more clarification on. 


	Under the laws of the Golden State, Newsom could still step in and even grant clemency to the Menendez brothers.  Yet, with the relative mild (by California standards) prohibition on future parole bids by the siblings out of this week's hearings, it is likely a dilemma the governor has no interest in dealing with now.

The spending spree after the killings is who they are. Rich kids with no morals.

Good.

They. Not smiling now are they the Smirking.   Bastards. They need to rot to death in Prison

They were both adults, they could have just moved far away from their parents.  It was common back then for 18 years olds to live on their own….independent from their families…VERY COMMON.

SO they stayed and murdered their parents for the money.

And that, you should stay in jail for a long time

Murder should lead to consequences guys. It's not about them it's about sending a message to the next would-be killers…

Kit Connor is preparing Heartstopper fans for an ending that's sure to have a few hearts racing.


	Following “week one” of filming on the Netflix movie finale, the actor teased “quite a steamy scene” in the concluding chapter of the LGBTQ teen romance series, based on the graphic novels by Alice Oseman.


	“So I was doing rugby training today, hence all the mud and lovely stuff—my favorite thing to do,” Connor told fellow actor Louis Partridge in a conversation for VMan, to which the Enola Holmes actor quipped: “If it isn't rugby training, it's SEAL training. That's just amazing.”

	Connor added, “Always some kind of throwing myself on the ground. We shot quite a steamy scene yesterday. So again, throwing myself on the ground in a different way.”


	His co-star Joe Locke previously said the movie is “a really nice closing chapter of the story.”


	Before Netflix announced the feature film finale in April, Oseman previously told Deadline she was hoping for a renewal, with the sixth and final installment of her graphic novel series in the works.


	“I think one more season or one more, whatever it could be, would finish the story, conclude everyone's character arcs, and help us to say goodbye to all of those characters,” said Oseman in October. “So yeah, keeping my fingers crossed.”


Heartstopper stars Connor and Joe Locke as Nick Nelson and Charlie Spring, two English schoolboys who spark a romance amid their unlikely friendship.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Katee Sackhoff says filming The Mandalorian ""broke"" her","https://www.avclub.com/katee-sackhoff-says-filming-the-mandalorian-broke-her","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 01:35:00 GMT","

Katee Sackhoff has been a staple of genre TV for more than two decades at this point, from pretty much the minute she stepped into the role of Kara “Starbuck” Thrace in the 2003 miniseries that eventually grew into the highly influential Battlestar Galactica reboot. Running, after the Syfy series eventually ended, through shows like 24 and most especially modern-day Western Longmire, Sackhoff has demonstrated an incredible, and incredibly consistent, knack for playing admirable-but-highly-fucked-up people, often operating at the edges of acceptable behavior. But it was, somehow, a space terrorist named after Dave Filoni's cat that apparently “broke” her as a performer.

Sackhoff was talking about her life and career on her YouTube series The Sackhoff Show last week when she revealed, somewhat surprisingly, that the experience of playing armored freedom fighter Bo-Katan Kryze on Disney+'s The Mandalorian completely shattered her confidence in herself. (The clip starts at about the 35:30 mark in the above link.) She was having the chat with her old BSG co-star Tahmoh Penikett, who serves as a nice audience stand-in here, in so far as he also seems completely flummoxed at the idea that the performer who explored every ugly, fascinating crevice of Kara Thrace's vision-haunted brain might bounce off of Jon Favreau's goofy Star Wars show. But that was maybe part of the problem: Sackhoff notes that she's never really played a “character” in her various projects, stating, “I've always played two steps removed from myself, in a sense.” When confronted with Bo-Katan, who took on an increasingly prominent role in the Disney show's third season, Sackhoff says, “Her life, what she wants, I didn't understand her. As much as I understood her, I never felt her in my stomach. I never identified with her. I didn't know how to find her.”

(As folks like IGN have noted, this is mildly wild in so far as Sackhoff had actually been playing the character for more than a decade at that point, albeit as a voice role; she originated the character in 2012, in an episode of Star Wars cartoon The Clone Wars. Still, we do get that there's a difference between being in the voice booth and actually portraying the character's whole physicality for several episodes at a time.)

Sackhoff says that her inability to fully find the character “Broke me, where I started doubting everything about myself… for three years, I basically didn't work. And it just destroyed my confidence.” (Indeed, a quick perusal of her IMDB shows that she's largely been relegated to voice roles ever since.) Sackhoff notes in the interview—even as a slightly shocked Penikett tries to remind her that she's Katee Sackhoff—that she's been working with an acting coach to help her find a process for when her innate grasp of a character fails her. But even so, it's fascinating (and slightly scary) to hear that the Star Wars machine could defeat a performer so well-known for brave, bold performances.

This week in Staff Picks, Matt Schimkowitz hails Steve Coogan's latest turn as a certain boorish broadcaster and Danette Chavez stumps for a Tubi (by way of AMC) original.



Alan Partridge, Steve Coogan's long-running alter ego, has rarely been so active. Following the prodigal Partridge's return to the BBC with This Time in 2019, Coogan and co-writers Neil and Rob Gibbons have explored the space, as it were, adapting Alan to different media. The trio sent Alan on the road for a motivational speaking tour, entitled Stratagem, in 2022 and released his third memoir, Big Beacon, the following year. There's more on the horizon, with a new BBC series, How Are You, arriving imminently. Adding to all this full-bodied Partridge are four seasons of a pocket-sized podcast, From The Oasthouse, which represents the best of modern Alan.

With the release of its fourth season in early July, From The Oasthouse continues Coogan's broad media satire in what is arguably the media's most influential format. As podcasts have allowed the world's free speech warriors to spread their audio cancer away from the prying ears of the mainstream, Partridge has spread his wings on Audible. Unshackled from the irons of the BBC or the North Norfolk Digital radio station, Alan can expound upon whatever flight of fancy flutters across his face. With each 20-minute episode, he comments on a variety of topics, from Twitter trolls and Brexit to that petrol station jingle he nearly remembers and the extensive list of broadcasters and entertainers who are more successful than he is. As with all Partridge, his perspective is painfully and hilariously specific, allowing for some of the sharpest and most incisive comedy of Coogan's career.

The Oasthouse format is straightforward and malleable. Ostensibly set from his home, which he calls the Oast house, even though he won't be drying any hops there, Oasthouse is an attempt at recreating idyllic British life from the perspective of a put-upon conservative broadcaster of a certain age. Following its impossible earworm theme, each episode follows Alan from his home or via a mobile recording unit as he goes about his day. Whether he's adding live commentary to King Charles' coronation, driving his assistant Lynn Benfield (dutifully played, once again, by Felicity Montagu) to the doctor, or on stakeout in an attempt to catch a neighbor illegally dumping building materials on his cul-de-sac, Coogan finds original avenues into the character's narcissistic Anglophilia. The mobility of the Partridge podcasting operation gives the show a narrative variety that separates it from the pack. Priding himself on authenticity, Coogan records his audio from whatever location Alan says he's in, whether that be from the front seat of his Lynn's Daewoo Tacuma or inside the hedges adjacent to the Alan Partridge Sound Bath Garden. It creates more of an audio drama, akin to a radio show, with crisp, reactive sound effects that allow Coogan and co. to mine as much specificity out of a situation as possible. The result is a podcast that rewards close listening and ASMR sensitivities.

Coogan's character is a broadcast chameleon, able to take the form of whatever medium he's placed in. One of Alan's artistically refined achievements was Mid Morning Matters, the high-concept sponcon-turned-webseries filmed from a webcam fixed to his radio mixing board. The need for him to fill space with words is among the most crucial elements of the Partridge experience. He needs room to banter, whether another person is present or not. On Audible, he doesn't have to worry about traffic and travel, nor segueing into songs; whatever he wants to talk about, he can wax poetic on for as long as he'd like. (Though his ad-reads are also tremendously funny, allowing him to show off his unrivaled enunciation and mastery of sibilants—Hear: Alan's ad read for Ship-Shape Fish Shop: “where fish makes a splash.”) Oasthouse follows in the faux-radio show tradition by forcing Alan into a box and making it his own. Unsurprisingly, Coogan and Gibbons have taken an overexposed and overdone format and made something radically new. Aha! 



A graphic designer (Okieriete Onaodowan as the eponymous protagonist) sets aside the 33rd year of his life for “martyrdom,” and things just get stranger and more poignant from there in Demascus, a stylish and prickly new sci-fi series from playwright Tearrance Arvelle Chisholm. The premise is like something out of Black Mirror: Demascus, nursing hurt feelings after overhearing his coworkers mocking him in the break room of their requisite sterile, near-future workplace, embarks on a fancy new form of therapy called D.I.R.T. (Digital Immersive Reality Therapy). When he slips on the sleek headset (take note, Oculus designers), he's able to visit alternate realities, “but only as a voyeur.” He's not to interfere or linger in his alternate lives, no matter how dangerous or titillating they may be—doing so “may permanently corrupt [his] primary reality.”

Though only six episodes, season one covers a lot of territory, occasionally with the use of self-driving cars that actually work (and even project a photorealistic image that would make the Driving Crooner weep). As Demascus slips into his alternate selves, the show takes a turn for the anthological, playing in different genres—domestic drama, queer romance, coming-of-age. Chisholm uses his theater background to powerful effect in the more intimate moments, like when a couples' night goes off the rails or Demascus' therapist Dr. Bonnetville (Janet Hubert, at once cool and maternal) urges him not to back away from his journey of self-discovery. “Nobody knows me. My one dominant quality is I'm unknowable,” Demascus tells her, half-resigned, half-relieved: “That's a good quality for a Black man to have, right?”

Will Demascus come to realize he's actually a voyeur in his primary reality too? That's just one of the questions posed in season one, along with more sweeping ones about abandonment, desire, rejection, and of course love. The series grows headier as it goes on, but even if Demascus starts to lose sight of who he is (or isn't), Chisholm and his fellow writers Lauren Glover and Kirk A. Moore maintain a firm grasp on their multiversal storytelling. A great supporting cast, including Hubert, Caleb Eberhardt, and Sasha Hutchings, also helps keep things grounded, but watching Onaodowan is like seeing a bud unfurl. He comes across as stoic, almost stiff, early on, but his movements grow looser and more assured as Demascus confronts the things in his life he once refused to see. The smiles come quicker, but so does the resentment and confusion; the character (and actor) is never more alive than when he accepts this contradiction.

And to think, we might not have this captivating new show were it not for Tubi, the not-so-little-anymore streamer that picked it up after AMC Networks chucked it onto the write-off heap along with Moonhaven season two and other originals. Now, though, Demascus can join audacious, Black-led series that defy easy description like I'm A Virgo, The Vince Staples Show, as well as the slightly more straightforward genre show The Lazarus Project (Paapa Essiedu should just be in more shows, especially ones that aren't Harry Potter-related). Tubi doesn't have the most vaunted slate of originals, but backing more shows like Big Mood and Demascus should help garner some prestige.

The origins of A Taste For Love—the semi-fictional Dracula puppet musical that serves as the shockingly triumphant climax of 2008 rom-com favorite Forgetting Sarah Marshall—are well-documented at this point. Stuck in a creative hole post-Freaks And Geeks, writer and star Jason Segel convinced himself the answer to his life's problems was to write several songs about Dracula's puppet love life, which he then took to his friend/former boss Judd Apatow in the hopes of getting some Hollywood magic applied to them. (Apatow's immediate response, according to Segel was a Herzog-esque: “You can't play this for anybody, ever.”) The project got a second un-life a little while later, when Segel was looking for a less traditional ending for Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and convinced Apatow to let him revive the gag. Fascinatingly, though, that wasn't the end of “Dracula's Lament,” as Segel revealed in a recent interview—timed to the upcoming third season of his Apple TV+ show Shrinking—that he still does “secret performances” of the musical from time to time.

﻿
There is some precedent for this, admittedly. Somewhat famously, Segel popped up on the 1000th episode of the now-shuttered The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson back in 2013 to give a full rendition of one of the show's songs, completely with full backing band. And Entertainment Weekly reported, back in 2023, that the actor had recently restored the Dracula puppet with the help of Los Angeles cultural institution The Bob Baker Marionette Theater, doing a show at the theater to commemorate the Dark Prince's revival. Still, it is wild to hear, in what is otherwise a pretty straightforward conversation about Shrinking, Harrison Ford, Michael J. Fox, etc., that Segel is still going out there from time to time to swear musical vengeance on Van Helsing. “I perform it every once in a while,” Segel revealed to Variety. “I do secret performances of the Dracula puppet musical around town. I did one at Hotel Cafe last year. I would like to do one soon at the Bob Baker Marionette Theater.”

Segel is less open about any wider ambitions to revive the project—he told GQ back in 2023 that he has a dream of making a fake special about his Sarah Marshall character taking the show to Broadway—but it's clear that Hollywood's No. 1 puppet enthusiast is still pretty excited about the idea of singing love songs in an intentionally cheesy Dracula voice.

Aaden Gosselin has offered fans a rare glimpse into his perspective on growing up in the spotlight, sharing his fondest memories from the family's reality TV days during a recent appearance alongside his mother, Kate Gosselin.

The 21-year-old, who was one of the sextuplets featured on the hit TLC series “Jon & Kate Plus 8,” opened up about his experience during an August 15 TikTok Live session with his mom, providing insights into what aspects of their televised childhood he felt stood out the most.

When asked to reflect on his favorite memories from filming the reality series, Aaden didn't hesitate to share his answer. “Probably anytime we went to Wyoming,” he said during the live video. “That was really fun.”

Kate immediately agreed with her son's reply. “Oh yeah,” she responded. “I was talking about it earlier how they sold the ranch in Wyoming—so sad.”

The Wyoming trips Aaden referenced occurred during two separate filming periods for the show. The first took place in 2009 when Kate made a solo journey to a dude ranch with her sons during her divorce proceedings with Jon, who remained home with the girls. The second adventure happened two years later when the entire family embarked on an RV trip to Jackson Hole while filming their spinoff series “Kate Plus 8.”

These travel experiences clearly made a lasting impression on Aaden, who has largely stayed out of the public eye since the show ended in 2017. His calm demeanor during the TikTok session was consistent with the personality traits his mother said she has consistently observed in him over the years.

“He's very chill. He's just a laid-back guy,” Kate explained during their interaction.

#tiktoklive #livehighlights A third part of my Live from last Friday night 8/15/25. Me and Aaden.

The recent TikTok appearance marks a notable return to public visibility for the Gosselin family. They stepped away from reality television after an 11-season run that spanned from 2007 to 2017. Kate has been gradually rebuilding her social media presence through lifestyle content on TikTok, sharing videos about cooking and household management.

During the August 21 livestream, Kate reflected on the possibility of rewatching their old episodes. “I'd love to see my reaction to our show — I'd probably just cry the whole time,” she shared.

The interaction between mother and son during their TikTok session revealed a warm dynamic. Aaden patiently helped Kate navigate viewer comments while she experimented with various digital filters. Their playful exchange offered viewers a glimpse into their current relationship. Aaden was adorned with digital mustaches and cowboy hats as Kate learned to use the platform's features.

Kate currently works as a pediatric home health care nurse after relocating to North Carolina, which is a significant career shift from her reality TV days. Her recent social media content focuses on everyday activities and has received largely positive responses from viewers.

The family's reality show documented the challenges and joys of raising eight children, including twins Mady and Cara, now 24, along with sextuplets Aaden, Alexis, Hannah, Collin, Leah, and Joel, all now 21. Some family members have spoken about the difficulties of growing up in the public eye. However, Aaden's recent comments focused on the positive experiences from their time on television.

Several of Kate's children have made appearances in her recent TikTok content. This includes daughter Alexis, who was seen giving her mother a hug before heading out in one of the videos.

Fans have responded positively to Kate's return to social media. Many noted her apparent contentment in this new phase of life. One viewer commented: “Who would've thought in 2025 that Kate Gosselin would be my soothing decompress videos to watch!”

Matt Lauer made a rare public appearance during a recent dinner outing in Sag Harbor, New York, showcasing a dramatically different look that has social media users expressing shock at his transformation from the polished television personality viewers once knew.

The former “Today” show anchor was photographed by celebrity photographer Danny Ordonez, who shared the image on Instagram, describing the 67-year-old as looking “calm and relaxed.” However, it was Lauer's striking appearance change that captured widespread attention online.

The man who once appeared on television in perfectly tailored suits and meticulously groomed hair was photographed sporting a completely bald head, wearing a black-and-white patterned shirt, white skinny jeans, and white sneakers. The casual ensemble is a stark departure from his former professional image.

A post shared by Elder Ordonez (@elderordonez1)

Social media reactions were immediate and unfiltered. “Omg. Would never recognize him,” one user commented, echoing the sentiments of many longtime viewers who remembered Lauer from his 21-year run on NBC's “Today” show.

Another user noted, “He looks awful! So aged!” Others simply observed how much he had changed, with one remarking, “Time has not been kind to Matt Lauer.”

During his broadcasting career, Lauer maintained an impeccable professional appearance that became part of his television brand. He always chose crisp white or light blue dress shirts and had them pressed and fitted perfectly. His suits were also invariably tailored in conservative shades like navy, charcoal, or gray.

The silk ties he selected featured subtle patterns such as stripes, dots, or geometric designs that complemented his overall aesthetic. He always kept his salt-and-pepper hair perfectly groomed, cutting it short and styling it carefully to show his attention to detail.

The difference between Lauer's carefully maintained television look and his current appearance shows his complete step away from the spotlight that once required such careful attention to image. The change suggests a more casual, perhaps more authentic version of himself that doesn't need the daily grooming routines that defined his television career.

Lauer's fall from prominence began in November 2017 when NBC News terminated his employment over allegations of “inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.” The network announced his firing in a memo to staff, explaining they had received a detailed complaint from a colleague and had “reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.” 

The morning NBC announced his termination, co-hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb delivered the news live on air. Visibly shaken, Guthrie addressed the difficult situation: “How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly? I don't know the answer to that,” she said, according to Parade.

Since his firing, Lauer has maintained a low profile and avoided public appearances. According to People, sources reveal that he now lives a quieter life, maintaining relationships with his three children and girlfriend Shamin Abas, whom he began dating in 2019. He sold his Hamptons home last year, choosing to spend more time at his New Zealand farm property.

Recently, former CNN anchor Don Lemon suggested during a podcast interview that the public might welcome Lauer's return to television, noting that when they're out together, “everybody loves Matt and everybody flocks to Matt.” However, whether Lauer has any interest in returning to the spotlight remains unclear.

Cindy Crawford is soaking up the last days of summer, showing off her radiant, makeup-free look in a new Instagram post. Her daughter, Kaia Gerber, is sharing the love in the comments, too.

A post shared by Cindy Crawford (@cindycrawford)

The ‘90s supermodel, 59, shared a glimpse of her late-summer adventures and travels in her August 22 Instagram post. The carousel of photos featured Crawford embracing a fresh, makeup-free look.

In the first photo, Crawford can be seen with her husband, Rande Gerber, 63. The couple is smiling alongside each other while on a boat.

Crawford was embracing the natural look, showing off her radiant skin as the sun hit her head. She can also be seen sporting her summer tan during the casual outing.

The supermodel was wearing a plunging satin maxi dress. She accessorized it with black sunglasses and a trucker hat.

In the second photo, Crawford kept things even more laid-back. She can be seen wearing cozy sleepwear, pairing it with a loose gray long-sleeve tee with white pajama shorts, and fur-lined brown loafers.

Makeup-free and relaxed, she was living her best life. Crawford can be seen holding a striped coffee mug while showing off her striking side profile.

The Instagram post also included an image of Crawford spending some time with her friends, Stephanie Coffey and actress and Bleusalt founder, Lyndie Benson.

It was time spent by the water for the girls' catch-up day, as Crawford looked amazing while sporting a tie-dye cover-up and oversized straw hat. The supermodel was having another makeup-free day, letting her skin breathe for the day.

Crawford captioned the photos, saying, “And that's a wrap on summer ‘25 ❤️🌅🌊.”

Crawford's daughter, Kaia Gerber, wrote the sweetest comment on her mom's post. The 23-year-old said, “Gorgeous parents.”

Crawford's fresh-faced look in the photos shouldn't surprise anyone. She spoke in a Vogue beauty tutorial video back in 2019 that she started embracing wearing less makeup as she got older.

She also talked about how her husband actually prefers her natural skin compared to a full face of products.

“My husband hates makeup, so this is already too much makeup for him,” Crawford said. “But I do explain to him that women do make-up for other women, not men.”

She went on to explain how she is wearing less makeup as she gets older. Crawford added, “I would say that's the biggest evolution for me, which is kind of counterintuitive, but that also means that taking care of your skin is more important because you're not covering it up with makeup.”

Katee Sackhoff has opened up about a challenging period in her career when playing Bo-Katan Kryze in “The Mandalorian” left her struggling with self-doubt and confidence issues that affected her ability to secure new roles for several years.

The Hallmark star, who appeared in the 2021 Hallmark holiday film “Christmas Sail,” as well as the acclaimed sci-fi series “Battlestar Galactica,” shared her honest account during a recent episode of her podcast “The Sackhoff Show,” revealing how the experience of portraying the militant Mandalorian character created unexpected professional challenges that extended far beyond filming.

Sackhoff explained that playing Bo-Katan presented unique difficulties because she couldn't establish the personal connection that had helped her succeed in previous roles. The character's motivations and personality felt completely foreign to her own experiences and instincts as an actor.

“I lost all of my confidence after Mandalorian. All of it,” Sackhoff shared on her podcast. “I've always played two steps removed from myself, in a sense. It always felt grounded in some part of my belly, of who I was. Bo-Katan is nowhere near who I am as a human being. Her life, what she wants — I didn't understand her.”

The actress continued to describe her struggle: “As much as I understood her, I never felt her in my stomach. I never identified with her. I didn't know how to find her.”

Sackhoff first voiced Bo-Katan in the animated series “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” in 2012, later reprising the role in “Star Wars Rebels” in 2017. She made her live-action debut as the character in two episodes of “The Mandalorian's” second season in 2020, then played a more prominent role throughout season 3 in 2023.

Despite having experience with the character through voice work for about a decade, transitioning to live-action presented new challenges that caught Sackhoff off guard. The disconnect she felt with Bo-Katan's personality and motivations created an unusual professional obstacle for the experienced actress.

The impact of her “Mandalorian” experience extended well beyond the show's production, affecting Sackhoff's career trajectory and mental state. After season 3 wrapped in spring 2022, she found herself struggling to regain her footing in the industry.

“It broke me. It just broke me,” Sackhoff revealed. “I started doubting everything about myself. I'm not a strong auditioner on tape, and I was having to put myself on tape. I wasn't booking anything. And for three years, I basically didn't work, and it just destroyed my confidence.”

During this difficult period between 2022 and 2024, Sackhoff's only on-camera credit was a single episode of “Law & Order.” She continued performing voiceover work for projects including “Robot Chicken” and animated “Watchmen” and “Justice League” movies, plus reprised Bo-Katan once more in a 2024 episode of “Star Wars: Tales of the Empire.”

Recognizing she needed help to overcome these challenges, Sackhoff made strategic changes to her professional team and sought guidance from an acting coach. This decision proved instrumental in helping her rediscover her confidence and passion for performing.

“[The coach] said to me, ‘My goal is not to teach you how to act. You know how to act,'” she remembered. “‘I just need to get you back in your belly. You just need to find your confidence again.' That's it.”

Sackhoff is now preparing for her return to television in an upcoming limited series adaptation of Stephen King's “Carrie.” The project reunites her with filmmaker Mike Flanagan, with whom she previously collaborated on the 2013 film “Oculus.”

“I trust Mike,” Sackhoff said about the upcoming project. “I've relinquished control and I trust Mike, 'cause I've worked with him before and I know he's amazing. I don't know if I trust myself yet.”

On the premiere episode of Kelly Clarkson's new “Songs & Stories With Kelly Clarkson” series on NBC, “The Voice” coach welcomed the Jonas Brothers for an hour of conversation and music. 

During their discussion, one of the most fascinating exchanges was between Clarkson and former “The Voice” coach Nick Jonas about their little-known song with comedian Steve Martin, for which they're both credited as writers. The way the song materialized was a total surprise to Jonas, who said he was shocked when he was told he'd written a song with Clarkson. 

Jonas kicked off the fascinating conversation about his collab with Clarkson by saying, “I have a co-write with you, which is wild.”

“I know! I didn't even think about that till (now),” Clarkson marveled about the tune, “I Hate Love,” which appeared on her 2023 album “Chemistry.”

Jonas then explained how the collaboration happened, recalling, “I get this call, they're like, ‘Hey, can you approve this split for this song with Kelly?”

After Clarkson noted that a “split” is when other artists become involved in the songwriting process and need to be credited as a co-writer, Jonas continued, “And I'm like, ‘I'm sorry, what are you talking about?' And they're like, ‘Oh, I guess you wrote a song with her. And I was like, ‘I think I would remember that!'” 

“A producer that we both worked with had opened up a guitar track or something that I had started,” Jonas continued. “And you finished the song — and Steve Martin jumped on with a banjo part.”

Clarkson beamed, “Who knew!? And all of a sudden we have a song with Steve Martin.”

Jonas replied, “That's right — my coolest career accomplishment.”

A post shared by NBC Entertainment (@nbc)

Clarkson's new four-part series, which she executive produced, was filmed before the death of her ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, which caused her to cancel her Las Vegas residency and miss taping an episode of “The Voice” season 29. 

According to NBC's logline for the show, it will give viewers “a front-row pass for Kelly Clarkson to engage with some of her favorite celebrities and examine both their music and personal lives. The specials are a forum where iconic voices meet heartfelt storytelling through unfiltered conversation and sung in an intimate, unplugged setting.”

Fellow executive producer Alex Duda, who also oversees Clarkson's talk show, told TV Insider that the new series “allows Kelly to do what she does best — dive deep into the music and combine her musical expertise with her genuine curiosity.”

Clarkson's future guests are Gloria Estefan, Lizzo, and Teddy Swims, with each hour-long episode airing on Tuesday nights at 10 p.m. Eastern time.

Weeks after learning their HGTV show “Married to Real Estate” had not been renewed for a fourth season, Egypt Sherrod and Mike Jackson were stunned when the series was nominated for a 2025 Emmy Award. 

However, reports that pressure from fans and the Emmy nod have convinced the network to bring the series back are “fake news,” the couple said in a social media video on August 21, 2025. The duo did reveal they're back to filming, but said they're not interested in returning to HGTV.

When a follower asked in the comments, “Would you even go if you were asked back 🤔,” Sherrod gave a blunt six-word response: “No, we would not. New chapters.”

A post shared by Egypt Sherrod (@egyptsherrod)

Fed up with hearing false reports about their marriage and their show's future, Jackson posted a video on August 21 to clear up the rumors, and Sherrod walked into the room to join him. 

“There have been articles and rumors going around that we've been asked or invited back to HGTV,” Jackson said and Sherrod shook her head, adding, “Oh. No.”

“I'll say this,” Jackson continued. “Unless you hear it from us or we have our representation say it, it's not true.” 

“We happened to be scrolling,” Sherrod said, telling followers that they'd recently seen nine online articles that claimed to have interviewed the couple, with fake quotes from them about going back to HGTV. 

“Here's the thing, too, though, we are filming,” Sherrod added coyly, to which Jackson replied, “Yes we are! We're filming some good stuff, we're in conversations.”

Sherrod appeared nervous about her husband saying any more, and reiterated, “We are filming. And we will tell you first where our ‘next' is. But it is not going to come from any of those articles, and we are not going backwards — only forward.”

A post shared by Egypt Sherrod (@egyptsherrod)

One month after the finale of Sherrod and Jackson's fourth season of “Married to Real Estate,” the couple was surprised to learn their show wouldn't be returning. Fans were equally shocked.  

In a statement Sherrod issued via social media on June 24, 2025, she posted in black text on a white background, “Mike and I just landed back in the States after an unforgettable family trip through the Mediterranean, and we're met with unexpected news: HGTV has decided not to move forward with Married to Real Estate.”

“While the chain of events leading up to this is disheartening,” she continued, “we are deeply grateful. Grateful for four incredible seasons. Grateful for our amazing crew and supportive fans. Grateful that our businesses continue to thrive. And most of all — grateful that we are still very much married to real estate (and to each other). ❤️”

The Atlanta-based couple and their daughters decided to clear their heads with an impromptu Florida beach getaway, posting pics and even meeting up with “100 Day Dream Home” stars Brian and Mika Kleinschmidt. 

Upon returning home, the duo learned “Married to Real Estate” had been nominated for a 2025 daytime Emmy Award, an honor neither of them could believe. 

In the last paragraph of an August 14 post by Sherrod, she wrote, “There's more to say, and we'll share soon. But for now, know this: not all setbacks are what they seem. Some blessings show up in disguise. We've been here before. We'll keep counting those blessings — and keep it moving. Stay tuned.”

8.7

 Best New Reissue

Genre:

Electronic

Label:

Lo Recordings / Skintone

Reviewed:

August 23, 2025

Even as a young person making music for other young people to dance to, Susumu Yokota was fascinated by death. On the sleeve of his 1998 album Image 1983 - 1998, he wrote, “I wished to be kona”—a Japanese word meaning “powder,” “dust,” or “flour”—“at the moment of death.” Gather a handful of powder and blow on it, he wrote, and the particles will never come together in the same way again—a metaphor, perhaps, for reincarnation. “It is atmosphere that I'm interested in,” he told The Wire the following year, attempting to describe the increasingly amorphous electronic music he'd begun releasing on his new label, Skintone. “It's like powder. Abstract. Free. One breath—pffff—and it's gone.”

Yokota's work was not always so atmospheric. A graphic designer and self-taught musician, he gravitated first to moody post-punk bands like Joy Division, Durutti Column, and Young Marble Giants, but by the early 1990s, as acid house hit Japan, he threw himself into dance music with gusto. Between 1992 and 1997, he released some 30 records under a dozen different aliases, all of them bursting with the supersaturated colors and vivid shapes of the techno revolution.

There was the acid trance of 1993's The Frankfurt-Tokyo Connection, for Sven Väth's Harthouse label, and 1994's similarly psychedelic Acid Mt. Fuji, for Japan's Sublime; there were the bleepy, Detroit-inspired sounds of his 246 project and the jazz-tinged breakbeat whimsy of 1996's Cat, Mouse and Me. But in 1998, a fissure appeared in Yokota's work. While he would continue to release jazzy deep house on albums like 1998, 1999, and Zero, he was privately becoming interested in a homespun interpretation of ambient music. Frustrated with the music industry and souring on club culture, he founded Skintone, named after a deep-house party in the Ebisu district he co-ran with Alex From Tokyo, as an outlet for his more idiosyncratic output; between 1998 and 2012, he would release 14 albums on the imprint.

Yokota died in 2015, at age 54. And while his music is hardly unknown—unlike his ambient predecessor Hiroshi Yoshimura, his work was always available in the West, thanks to licensing deals with UK labels Leaf and Lo Recordings—his profile has faded in the decade since his death, though his music sounds as timely now as ever, if not more so. A lavish new box set gathers his first seven Skintone albums (volume two is due next year), offering the chance to reconsider the work of this one-of-a-kind visionary.

Yokota's first Skintone album, 1998's Magic Thread, is a record of two minds, alternating between atmospheric soundscaping and elliptical, minimalist house. What the two facets share in common is their unusual sound design, seemingly sourced from found objects—like the rattle of gears in “Spool” or what might be a finger dialing a rotary telephone in “Unravel”—and the ambient hum of the city. In his youth, Yokota fashioned sound-making devices out of items rummaged from his father's workshop; Magic Thread suggests a collection of sculptures cobbled together out of bent paper clips, lumps of clay, and torn paper bags.

The loop is the organizing principle of both the beat-driven and the abstract tracks, but unlike the clean lines and quantized pulses of sequencers, Magic Thread's sample-based assemblages wobble and warp in suggestively hypnotic ways. There are no precedents for the album's unstable fusion of styles in Yokota's catalog—and few, in fact, anywhere else in the electronic music of the 1990s. Unlike the warm, wooly ambient house of the KLF and the Orb, Yokota's take on the style is a moodier, more idiosyncratic affair, spiritually aligned with the lumbering beats that Matthew Herbert and Dettinger were beginning to explore around the same time, half a world away.

Released later the same year, Image 1983 - 1998 marked an even cleaner break with Yokota's club music. The first tracks date to 1983-84, when Yokota was in his early 20s. “Kaiten Mokuba” and “Fukuru No Yume” sound like experiments in fairground concrète, organs slipping in disorienting circles; the pensive guitar of “Tayutafu” suggests kinship with Nick Drake, whose Fruit Tree box set had been released just a few years prior, while the processed guitar of “Wani Natte” reveals his affinity for Durutti Column's Vini Reilly. No obvious gap separates those early sketches with the late-'90s pieces that comprise the rest of the record; the latter just feel fuller and more immersively atmospheric, evidence of Yokota's increasingly assured vision.

The instrumentation—guitar, piano, organ, even harmonica—heralds what, within a few years, would be known as “folktronica,” but the foggy loops and murky layers lend a dreaminess distinct from the more vivid sounds that Four Tet would soon begin making. “Yumekui Kobito” punctuates brittle piano and chimes with a cryptic, almost inaudible sigh, like a pause-button edit of a Saturday-morning cartoon; “Morino Gakudan” sounds like an attempt to recreate a half-remembered Steve Reich piece; the blurry organs and lilting coos of “Enogu” show the influence of Yokota's Kankyō Ongaku predecessor Hiroshi Yoshimura. The standout is “Kawano Hotorino Kinoshitade,” which pairs a high, lonesome vocal loop reminiscent of Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works Volume II with buoyant layers of Rhodes electric piano—a minimalist gem whose simplicity belies its depth of feeling.

In 1999, Yokota released Sakura, widely considered his masterpiece. Slower and more spacious, it feels like a distillation of the ambient experiments of Magic Thread and Image 1983 - 1998. Rhodes keys swim in reverb and tremolo, echoing the stillness of Yoshimura's GREEN and Music for Nine Postcards; mournful harp and string melodies hark back to Japanese folk; wordless, keening vocals, a Yokota trademark, lend a mournful undercurrent. Despite the pensive mood, Sakura—named after the cherry blossoms seen in Japanese culture as symbols of transience and renewal—throws out the occasional curveball: The glistening ambient techno of “Genshi” prefaces the sound the Field would take up in the mid 2000s, while “Naminote” flips a rolling Chick Corea sample into dubbed-out deep house. For some, these shifts in tone might prove distracting, but I think they speak to what made Yokota special: He stubbornly refused to acknowledge barriers between his disparate interests.

He would emphasize the breadth of his range in 2001, releasing two albums diametrically opposed in style. Grinning Cat, constructed largely out of layers of piano, floats between ambient and downbeat; the mood is rosier than on Sakura, reflecting Yokota's newfound domestic bliss with his girlfriend and her three cats. (“The everyday life with cats is like a fairytale,” he wrote at the time.) Crisp, carefully carved breakbeats assume a more prominent role on tracks like “King Dragonfly” and the Massive Attack-like “Flying Cat,” but you can also sense his collages getting spongier and more dissonant, marked by unconventional blends and unexpected shifts. Will, released later that year, might as well be the work of a completely different artist: nine tracks of jazzy, Latin-tinged deep house indebted to artists like Pal Joey and Masters at Work, and far more in keeping with his non-Skintone releases from the period, like 2000's Zero. Yet while Grinning Cat and Will couldn't be more different stylistically, both sound like expressions of the deepest kind of bliss, one private and the other communal.

The complexity of emotion was on Yokota's mind in these years. “I'm trying to achieve that beautiful thing,” he told an interviewer in 2002. “There is always fear, rage, and ugliness existing behind beauty,” he said, explaining that his goal was to express ki-do-ai-raku—joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness; a shorthand phrase for the full range of human emotions—in his music. He came closest on 2002's The Boy and the Tree and 2003's Laputa, the final two albums collected in Skintone Edition Volume 1. Structurally, they represent a return to the exploratory sample play of Sakura and Grinning Cat, but there's a newfound mystery in their movements, a sense that Yokota is feeling his way toward ideas that even he doesn't quite understand.

Inspired by a visit to Yakushima Island's Unsuikyo Ravine—the inspiration for Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke and home to the Jomon Sugi, a cedar tree estimated to be as many as 7,000 years old—The Boy and the Tree is part forest bathing, part plunderphonic immersion in Yokota's record collection. Its 12 deeply psychedelic tracks fold together birdsong, chanting, raga, gamelan, flute, marimba, zither, revving motorcycles, and hand percussion. The ambient tracks take shape like drops of ink spreading through water; the rhythmic ones eschew conventional drum programming for scraps of percussion and stringed instruments from around the world, weaving them into pulsing throughlines that bring order to the gentle chaos of his flyaway sounds.

If The Boy and the Tree is Yokota at his most satisfyingly complex, 2003's Laputa shows him at his most bewildering. The album's 15 tracks—some just a minute or two long, and none reaching five—unfold like dreams, or landscapes blurring past the window of a speeding train. Even the best ambient music can be difficult to recall in detail once it has finished playing, but in the case of Laputa, you may have difficulty remembering how a given track even began. “Rising Sun” is a swirl of birdsong, drones, cowboy guitar, ring-modulated gurgling, and what sounds like a scrap of operatic aria lifted from a scratchy 78; “Gong Gong Gong” collages together gongs, pedal steel, and nonsensical spoken-word; “Lost Ring” superimposes ECM-grade ambience with Blade Runner-esque noir saxophone and, briefly and bizarrely, a perky splash of bluesy Hammond organ. The mood throughout is sometimes beatific, sometimes druggily disturbing. I'm frequently reminded of Philip Jeck's slowed-down vinyl excavations; a ghostly quality hangs over every track and every sample, as though Yokota were seeking to contact spirits. The spectral “Trip Eden”—a liquid soundscape of moaning voices and shivery close harmonies—might be the most harrowing thing he ever recorded.

Seven albums can be a lot to absorb from any artist; all the more so when they entail such jarring shifts in mood—like Will—or require such focused, emotionally engaged listening, like Laputa. But Yokota benefits from the box-set treatment. To immerse yourself in his work is to be reminded of its uncommon depth, and to realize how intricately it's all connected. The abject mourning of “Trip Eden,” the insouciance of “King Dragonfly,” the bliss of “Hagoromo”—they are all facets of Yokota's pursuit of a totalizing picture of human emotion. In the original liner notes to Image 1983 - 1998, Yokota looked back on his years obsessed with dance music with alarm and regret. “My life became techno,” he wrote. “From morning until evening, rhythms were repetitively ticked off while sleeping, and fractal images were the only reflection I saw…. I was slipping into the memories of the future. After awakening from this mind-control, I started to seek and get inspiration from reality and everyday life; the food I eat, cats from my neighbourhood, and most of all, how I live.” These seven albums make clear how profoundly Yokota was able to translate his quotidian reality to tape, resulting in some of the most original and idiosyncratic ambient music of its era. Skintone Edition Volume 1 is a moving portrait of a life lived in sound.

	It has been one of the most tumultuous and significant weeks in the global political battle over the war in Ukraine. It began last Friday, with the cringe-worthy summit in Alaska between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, followed just three days later by seven of Europe's most prominent leaders rushing to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's side, arriving at the White House to provide backup for a hastily scheduled meeting with Trump. 


	The unprecedented series of events resulted in Trump ceding to at least two of Putin's most harmful demands: no cease-fire in Ukraine and no additional sanctions on Russian oil and gas. 


Russia inched ever-closer to its goal of re-entering the global economy, unshackled by increased sanctions and with hefty benefits for the world's largest fossil fuel companies in return, even offering up lucrative deals to ExxonMobil as the summit got underway. Ukraine tried to compete, proffering oil and gas contracts and an oil refinery project under the special terms reserved exclusively for American companies under Trump's U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement. Efforts are also underway to facilitate the increased sale of Russian oil and gas under the cover of American ownership.

	











	The negotiations failed to quell Russia's brutal war against Ukraine, which raged on, claiming lives and treasure as the talks took place. Instead, the episode underscored a treacherous new global balance of power, in which the U.S. government under Trump continues to ally with the world's most brutal autocrats and dictators.

	











	“Putin was completely shunned by the West, and here we have an American president who's invited him to Alaska for something so symbolic and so important and he hasn't even had to do anything to get there, except for continue fighting in Ukraine,” Sergey Radchenko, a Cold War historian at Johns Hopkins University, tells me. “Putin probably sees himself as having been able to score a major victory without paying anything for it.”

	The summit, ostensibly about ending the war in Ukraine, focused as much if not more on opening investment and business collaborations between the U.S. and Russia. Though the “Ukrainian question” was declared to be the main item of the agenda, “much more important global issues” would be raised in Alaska, including ambitious plans for U.S. and Russian energy cooperation, senior Russian lawmaker Sergey Gavrilov told The Wall Street Journal ahead of the summit.


	“Under the cover of the peace talks, Putin is just looking for political and economic gain including easing global economic pressure,” Yuliia Melnyk, an environmental policy consultant and the co-founder and director of Ukrainian environmental organization, Ekoltava, tells me. “One of the key solutions to this war is breaking dependence on fossil fuels.”


	“I thought this war was black and white, who the bad guys are, but I don't see the U.S. as the ‘good guy'' anymore, and that means that the order of the world as it was is not collapsing, but you can see cracks,” Ukrainian Mariia Freeman tells me, sadness filing her voice. “It started with my country and the price for that is in lives.” 


	I met Freeman on a busy street corner in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, standing amid a sea of blue and yellow Ukrainian flags and bright yellow sunflowers. She had joined hundreds of other people lining the streets to protest the war in Ukraine on the eve of the summit. Smiling, waving, and holding up signs reading, “Where's Zelensky?” “Stay home dictators!” and “I can see fascists from my window,” their chants were routinely drowned out by the booming horns of trucks and the honks of passing cars expressing solidarity. Freeman's family fled Luhansk city in the Donbas region of Ukraine in 2014 following the Russian occupation and annexation, only to be forced out of Ukraine altogether after Putin's 2022 full-scale invasion and war, the deadliest war in Europe since World War II.

	Freeman now lives in Anchorage. “It feels like Putin is following me,” she says. 

	











	At the Alaska summit, Putin took a victory lap around Trump, beaming all the while. Trump, who loves autocrats and dictators — especially the fossil-fueled kind — and is doing his best to become one within the strained confines of American democracy, was devoid of his characteristic bombast, appearing instead visibly submissive to Putin. 


	Images of a red carpet literally rolled out for Putin to step from his plane and onto U.S. soil dominated Ukrainian social media, posted and reposted with expressions of shock and outrage. It was the opening salvo to a hero's welcome on the tarmac of the U.S. military's Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage where Trump and Putin stood laughing and smiling together. 


	The International Criminal Court in The Hague issued an arrest warrant for Putin in 2023, charging him with war crimes in Ukraine. This means that he can only travel to those countries where the government won't immediately hand him over to the court. Lucky for Putin, the U.S. is not a party to the ICC, so Trump was not obligated to turn him in, and had no intention of doing so.


	Standing on the tarmac, ABC news reporter Rachel Scott shouted, “President Putin, will you stop killing civilians?” Both men shrugged it off, as her repeated questions were drowned out by handlers yelling loudly, “Thank you press, thank you press.” Putin then hopped into the “Beast,” the U.S. presidential limousine, riding side-by-side with Trump.


	I joined a who's-who of U.S., Russian, and other global media restricted to a nearby press tent watching the arrival unfold on our laptops. We noted other clues as to how the day's events would unfold, watching video of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arrive in Alaska wearing a CCCP shirt, the Russian letters for the former Soviet Union of which Ukraine was once a part. (Alaska was also once a part of the Russian Empire.) A neighbor leaned in close to me and whispered conspiratorially, “I heard that on their flight to Alaska, Russia media were served Chicken Kyiv.”


	The Russians smoked while we waited for hours alongside a row of porta-potties for the big event — a joint press conference between the two presidents. Around 2 p.m., we were rushed out of the tent and into a small well-kept theater.

	











	If you watched the press conference live, you'd be forgiven for thinking you'd stumbled upon Russian television, as it was primarily conducted in Russian (we wore headphones providing translation). Against a blue and white backdrop reading, “Pursuing Peace,” Putin entered the stage and spoke first, delivering an 8.5 minute soliloquy. He emphasized his close bromance with Trump, whom he first identified merely as “my American counterpart”; the historic ties that bind Russia and the U.S., including the defeat of “common enemies”; and the “tremendous potential” of economic and trade ties, including in both the U.S. and Russian oil and gas-rich Arctic. 


	Putin mentioned Ukraine just five times, stating that “today's agreements” would be a starting point for “the Ukrainian issue.” He called for peace, while reiterating his long-standing demand to end the “root causes of the war.” This is Putin's shorthand for his list of maximalist demands on Ukraine, which rejects any cease-fire agreement and NATO membership, would neuter Ukraine's military, cedes all areas of Ukraine now under Russian control to Russia, requires new elections (which Putin anticipates will replace Zelensky with a Russian-friendly puppet), and an end to sanctions on Russia.


	Trump looked cowed and tired when it was his turn on the mic, speaking in a low gravelly voice for just a few minutes — a fraction of Putin's time. He also emphasized their close relationship and praised the “tremendous Russian business representatives here.” He said they'd reached agreement on most key items and that he'd promptly call Zelensky and European leaders. 


	“Next time in Moscow!” Putin said, a huge smile spreading across his face as Trump wrapped up. “I could see it possibly happening, thank you very much, Vladimir,” Trump meekly replied.


	They did not take a single question from reporters — highly unusual for Trump, but just the way Putin likes it. I had already noticed Fox News' Sean Hannity standing behind me, a shit-eating grin on his face. As they walked rapidly off the stage, Hannity followed and promptly conducted an exclusive half-hour, one-on-one interview with Trump in the same room where the summit took place. 


No Cease-Fire, No Sanctions












	Hannity and Trump traded thinly veiled barbs — Trump noted that “some people say you're not smart,” to which Hannity later retorted, that “some people say that you're doing all of this work, none of which benefits the U.S.” But the tete-a-tete served both men's purposes. Hannity hawked his radio and TV shows, and Trump made sure that Zelensky heard three key words: “Make a deal,” Trump said. “He's got to make a deal. Russia is a very big power.” He added, “we're number one, their number two.”


	Going into the summit, Trump repeated his demand that Putin agree to a cease-fire and threatened increased sanctions on Russian finance, oil, and gas if he did not. Trump had begun to act on the threats weeks earlier, but in a monumental concession to Putin, ultimately capitulated on both demands once the summit concluded.


	Unlike Trump, Yuriy Vitrenko has gone head-to-head against Putin and won. Vitrenko is the former head of Ukraine's state energy company and Ukraine's former Acting Minister of Energy. He runs AYA Capital, which is trying to bring foreign investment into Ukraine. He has sat across the negotiating table from Putin and ultimately won two significant legal cases worth billions of dollars against Putin's prize oil and gas company, Gazprom, which Vitrenko describes as “Putin's favorite geopolitical tool.”


	“For Putin, energy is the pillar of Russia's strength and as a result its position in the world and his own claim to be above the law,” Vitrenko tells me. Russia's vast oil and gas provides the money that fuels its military might and Putin's imperialist cravings, Vitrenko says. 


	Trump, notably, started his interview with Hannity by first praising Putin, and then Russia's incredible oil and gas. 


	When Putin invaded Crimea in 2014, President Barack Obama imposed sanctions targeting Russia's oil and gas, including its Arctic operations. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, President Joe Biden joined world leaders in a much more aggressive global sanctions effort targeting not just Russian fossil fuels but also incentivizing a global movement off fossil fuels more broadly as the best path towards a lasting peace.


	“Everyone felt this, they knew that if we want to stop Russia, we must get rid of fossil fuels,” Ukrainian environmental lawyer, Svitlana Romanko, founder and director of Razom We Stand, tells me. “We started organizing together to make a public call which was to end the global fossil fuel addiction that feeds Putin's war machine.” 

	











	It's been working. “Russia's fossil fuel export revenues have fallen since the sanctions were implemented, subsequently constricting Putin's ability to fund the war,” reports U.K.-based research organization, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Russia's total revenue from all fossil fuel exports in July 2025 was nearly 40 percent lower than in July 2022, Isaac Levi, Europe-Russia Policy and Energy Analysis Team Lead at the Centre, tells me. 


	“The reason why Putin is out there in Alaska is to negotiate the removal of sanctions, which shows how important sanctions are on the Russian energy sector and economy,” Levi argues. But, he adds, “fossil fuel sanctions can and should be made much stronger.”


	Russia still produces and exports large amounts of fossil fuels, but it's receiving far less money in return. With 40 percent of Russia's federal budget from oil and gas prior to the war, the toll on the economy has been significant. Russia's shrinking pool of buyers is now dominated by China, with India a distant second (importing about half as much as China). Next comes Turkey followed by the European Union, which banned Russian oil imports, but continues to rely on Russian gas.


	In late July, Trump signed a new tariff arrangement with the European Union, requiring that it purchase U.S. energy. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, wrote of the agreement, “We will replace Russian gas and oil with significant purchases of U.S. [liquified natural gas], oil, and nuclear fuels.” It's a stunning reversal of her previous response to the war, writing in 2022 that the European Union “must get rid of its dependency on fossil fuels” altogether.


	Romanko is incredulous that the EU would see swapping dependence from Russian to U.S. energy as a solution. The priority is getting off “Russia's blood gas,” she explains, and the best way to do this is “just go green!” 


	On August 6, Trump took his most forceful action to date, announcing a 25 percent tariff on imports from India as a penalty for importing Russian oil — bringing India's U.S. tariff rate to a devastating 50 percent. Trump also threatened tariffs on China, but then backed off, telling Hannity they were off the table, at least for now, “because of what happened today” in the summit with Putin. The Indian tariffs also do not take effect until August 27, and several experts now doubt that they ever will. 

	











	“Trump made it very clear that he is not going to impose any additional sanctions on Russia for at least the next couple of weeks, which is already a good result for Putin,” Tatiana Mitrova, a research fellow at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, tells me. Mitrova previously served as Executive Director of the Energy Centre of the Moscow School of Management. 


	She sees the tariffs on India as more of a Trump negotiating ploy. “I assume that it's really an opportunity for Indian authorities to suggest something attractive to Trump” to get him to drop the Russian oil tariffs, Mitrova says. 


	Ukrainian environmental consultant Melnyk argues that governments should implement “rule of law conditionality” that blocks purchases of fossil fuels from “authoritarian regimes that violate international law and human rights.”


‘We Make Big Bucks'


	Well before arriving in Alaska, Putin and Trump personally discussed cooperation in the energy sector. For months, the U.S. and Russia have been negotiating lucrative oil and gas deals that would result in the lifting or easing of Russian sanctions. These include partnerships in the Arctic, liquified natural gas transit, and pipelines carrying Russian oil and gas to Europe, including within Ukraine through a U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement.


	Following a phone call between Trump and Putin in February, Secretary Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Putin's Foreign Policy Advisor Yuri Ushakov in Saudi Arabia, laying the groundwork for “historic economic and investment opportunities” resulting from “the end to the conflict in Ukraine,” according to the State Department. Ahead of the meeting, Russian Direct Investment Fund chief Kirill Dmitriev told reporters that the return of oil companies to Russia is inevitable. On March 3, the White House directed the State and Treasury departments to draft a list of sanctions that could be eased for U.S. officials to discuss with Russian representatives. 


	All of these officials, as well as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, attended the summit in Alaska. 


	Many people now “expect that sanctions on Russia will be lifted,” Mitrova tells me. “Lavrov mentioned in his interview right before the summit that he expects that at least some of the sanctions will be removed.” 


	On the day of the summit, Putin underlined the point, signing a decree that would allow ExxonMobil and other foreign investors back into the Russian Arctic once sanctions are removed. Mitrova points to “very interesting wording” which requires the companies to work for the “removal of political and economic sanctions which negatively affect the project, including going to court.” She adds, “I think it's mainly signaling Trump that ‘we are ready to open the doors again to the U.S. business, but you guys have to remove sanctions because otherwise they cannot work in Russia.'” 

	











As I reported in March, sanctions — combined with public opinion — forced most U.S. and other Western oil companies out of Russia and its vast oil and gas reserves. ExxonMobil was forced to abandon its stake in the Russian Arctic offshore Sakhalin-1 project, which is the target of Putin's decree. Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil and later Secretary of State in Trump's first administration, carefully built up a close relationship with Putin, ultimately establishing 10 joint ventures between Exxon and Russia's state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, by 2013. As a result of these deals, Exxon's 63.7 million-acre Russian holdings were nearly five times larger than its second-largest holdings — its 14 million acres in the United States. With the imposition of sanctions in 2014, Exxon was largely shut out of these operations, and then fully shut out as result of the 2022 invasion.  


	“We're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars,” says Vitrenko. “That's the sizable kind of pie that makes it attractive for big U.S. businesses that are also politically powerful, and they can deliver a message to the administration that says, ‘We make big bucks in Russia, so why don't you just find the compromise for them?'” 


U.S.-Ukraine “Minerals Deal” Bears Fruit


I reported in March on the U.S.-Ukraine “minerals agreement,” calling it a “fossil fuel shakedown.” The agreement, which gives the U.S. unprecedented influence over Ukraine's energy sector, was signed not long after the calamitous Oval Office meeting in February between Trump and Zelensky. Zelensky was forced to accept the deal given how closely aligned the Trump regime became with Putin. 


	Despite Trump's repeated references to “rare earth minerals”, the agreement covers all of Ukraine's natural resources, including oil, gas, and coal, and related infrastructure, such as pipelines, the bulk of which are found in areas of Ukraine now controlled by Russia. The agreement is focused on fossil fuels and is already yielding fruit for the U.S. and Russia. 


	The day before the summit, Ukraine announced the sale of two oil and gas blocks with special terms for U.S. investors, “with the right for a U.S. partner to purchase the output and a guarantee that no better terms will be offered to other participants,” noting that the terms were designed to fulfill the minerals agreement. Ukraine has also offered U.S. investment in an oil refinery — the nation's largest petroleum production site, owned and operated by Ukraine's largest oil company, the state-owned Ukrnafta. 

	











	Ukraine has its own agenda behind the offerings, hoping that they'll come with security guarantees. Zelensky met with U.S. companies operating in Ukraine in July to discuss the need for additional air defenses to protect businesses and cities. “We understand that if there is U.S. investment in the country, there's more motivation for the U.S. to protect (those assets),” Ukraine Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said. 


	The U.S. may also negotiate access for Russia to once again restart the flow of its gas through key Ukrainian pipelines. “The end game could be that the U.S. would allow certain limited volumes of Russian gas to transit via Ukraine, once the cease-fire or peace agreement is reached to the landlocked countries in Central Europe,” Mitrova says. Depending on the terms, this could be a profound victory for Russia which has long sought tighter control over the pipelines in Ukraine, but it's an outcome the Ukrainians feel they may need to accept if it helps lead to peace in negotiations so profoundly stacked against them.


	“Frankly, if somebody tells Ukraine that Russia will leave Ukraine, they will prosecute all the war criminals and pay reparations, [and] the only thing that Ukraine needs to do is to continue gas transit, probably Ukraine will continue gas transit,” Vitrenko tells me.


Russian Energy Dominance


	“If this level of engagement between Russia and the U.S. continues, it's very likely that there will be a resumption of Russian gas flows… involving U.S. intermediaries,” Reuters reported in May as officials from Washington and Moscow held discussions about the U.S. helping to revive Russian gas sales to Europe. “Sources close to the bilateral discussions said carving out a renewed role for Moscow in the European Union's gas market could help cement a peace deal with Putin.”


	Russian oil and gas would then be able to flow freely through pipeline agreements secured by the U.S. and with U.S. owners or investors. 


	Fossil fuels are the lifeblood of the Russian economy and the basis of Putin's power. They have long dominated Russian-Ukrainian relations, with gas flowing through the heart of the conflict. In 2020, the EU received about 40 percent of its gas imports from Russia, an amount that has fallen by half today. Gazprom posted a $7 billion loss the first year of sanctions, and will again record huge losses in 2025, which are then expected to balloon to some $187 billion over the next 10 years.

	











	Ukraine has always maintained the key role of delivering Russian gas to European markets via pipelines, dating back to the Soviet era. The government of Ukraine owns the pipelines, and Russia pays Ukraine transit fees, which have been a substantial source of revenue and conflict. Russia has sought for decades to either wrest greater control of its pipelines through Ukraine — which it could now achieve through the U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement — or bypass Ukraine altogether through the construction of several alternative gas pipelines, the most significant of which is Nord Stream 2. The long-stalled project could now be revived as part of Trump's economic negotiations with Russia. 


	Gazprom partnered with Shell and other companies to build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany. Amid global pressure to constrain Russian aggression in Ukraine, German regulators did not issue the final permit for the pipeline. In September 2022, in an act of sabotage, three underwater explosions hit Nord Stream 2 and its parent pipeline, Nord Stream 1, leaving only one of the four gas links in the network intact to this day. 


	Russian energy expert Levi believes that Russia did it. “Blowing up Nord Stream sent energy prices through the roof,” he tells me, which allowed Russia to severely defray the impacts of lost gas sales and sanctions.


	A group of U.S. investors is now seeking to revive Nord Stream 2, in a plan reportedly masterminded by Matthias Warnig, an ex-spy and close friend of Putin who until 2023 ran Nord Stream 2's parent company for Gazprom, reports the Financial Times. 


	The team of U.S. investors includes Frank Petruzzi. Petruzzi works out of a coffee shop on the Youngtown University campus in Ohio, where a placard on the bar reads, “Reserved for Frank.” A recent profile in the Youngstown Ohio Business Journal lays out a bio for Petruzzi which reads like the portrait of a Russian agent from a 1950s spy novel. In 1988, Petruzzi began shepherding journalists to Moscow and then joined the Peace Corps' business assistance program in Russia in 1994, ultimately spending the next two decades mostly living in Russia, sometimes unemployed or working with a variety of Russian business interests, “including an oligarch.” 


	Petruzzi said that his team submitted an application to the Treasury Department seeking clearance for the purchase of Nord Stream 2 last year. “The goal is to get that pipeline under the control of a U.S. group,” he explained, adding that there are several other deals with Russia that the group is working on.

	











	Petruzzi's main business partner is fellow Peace Corps-in-Russia alum, Stephen Lynch, who also lived in Russia for two decades. A Wall Street Journal interview of Lynch notes that questions have been raised about his ties to the Russian government. Lynch is a large Trump political donor and in 2022, he received a license from the Treasury Department to complete the acquisition of a Swiss subsidiary of a Russian bank that had been sanctioned by the U.S. government. In May, he met with German officials to discuss purchase of the pipeline, which the German government still vehemently opposes. 


	Elliott Investment Management, headed by billionaire and Republican mega-donor Paul Singer, is reportedly in talks in a separate deal to buy a stake in the TurkStream pipeline, Russia's last operational gas conduit to Europe. TurkStream traverses the Black Sea to Turkey before feeding pipelines supplying Hungary, Slovakia, and other nations.


	“If, say, the U.S. and Russia agree on cooperation in the energy sector, then a gas pipeline for Europe could be ensured,” Putin said at a briefing in Moscow. “And this will benefit Europe, as it will receive cheap Russian gas.” 


	Vitrenko, Ukraine's former acting energy minister, explains that while smaller players may be willing to work with Russia with exemptions from existing sanction regimes, the largest U.S. companies will wait for some kind of peace agreement. “CEOs of big oil companies want to go back to Russia, but not at any cost,” he says. “It's important that there is some kind of legitimacy.” 


	“They're making themselves clear that that's something that they would like to see,” he adds. “If Russia continues to be just an occupier, it's very difficult for the Exxons of this world to invest in Russia. Frankly, they need it to be whitewashed. Without whitewashing, they won't be able to do it.” 


“Ambitions of a Dictator”


	The day before the summit, John Hopkins' University's Radchenko described Putin's vision for Ukraine to me as “something like Belarus-plus, a vassal state of Russia ruled by a dictator.” Hours later, aboard Air Force One, Trump placed a call. 


	“I had a wonderful talk with the highly respected President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko,” he wrote on social media. Lukashenko is one of the longest-ruling dictators in the world and one of Putin's closest allies. Belarus' state news service said that Trump accepted an invitation from Lukashenko to visit Belarus' capital city, Minsk. 

	











	Viktor Orbán, Hungary's authoritarian strongman beloved by the American far-right, is set to host a potential trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and Putin — though recent reports say Trump is now backing away from participating. 


	Advocates stress that a just peace process for Ukraine must follow the rules of international law, not illegal backroom dealmaking between autocrats and dictators. 


	“We cannot return to that dark energy future that empowers dictators like Putin, fuels wars, and locks the world into fossil dependence,” says Romanko, of Rozam We Stand. “We need our full territories back, and an energy transition just as strong so that future generations of Ukrainians never again face a fossil-fueled monster, encouraged and sugarcoated by appeasement, red carpets, and the like.”


	Mariia Freeman, the Ukrainian from Luhansk, has been standing on street corners in Anchorage protesting against the war in Ukraine for almost four years. “It's better than sitting at home alone feeling depressed by the news,” she tells me. Seeing hundreds of people turn up to join her the day before the summit, “all those people who care,” she says, “was empowering.”

	President Donald Trump's deportation henchmen appear to have dramatically increased the use of Coast Guard aircraft to transport immigrants, according to flight data, activist flight trackers and video confirmation. 


	Since June 23, the majority of flights operated by the Coast Guard C-27J Spartan fleet — at least 263 flights — are likely to have been for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), transferring immigrants to and from ICE's nexus of detention centers in Alexandria, La., Harlingen, Texas, and the Florida Everglades camp known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” according to an analysis of public flight data. 


	On August 13 and August 22, Rolling Stone watched as federal agents loaded shackled immigrants onto Coast Guard aircraft in Baltimore. 


	The Coast Guard's larger propeller aircraft, the HC-130H Hercules and HC-130J Super Hercules, also appear to be operating ICE flights, though to a lesser degree. Flight data for the C-130 fleet show at least eight flights to and from Alexandria or Harlingen since late June. 

	











	Like federal emergency funds being used for immigrant detention centers, and agents across the federal government being directed to snatch up delivery drivers in their militarized takeover of Washington D.C., the Coast Guard flights are yet another example of the Trump administration funneling vast federal resources toward its mass deportation machine.

	“A Coast Guard C-27 conducted a mission today at the request of ICE and landed at BWI airport,” a Coast Guard spokesperson says, explaining: “The Coast Guard continues to surge assets and leverage its unique capabilities to protect America's borders, territorial integrity and sovereignty by assisting with the national transport of aliens to designated locations where the Department of Defense will transport the aliens internationally.”


	The spokesperson adds that “three USCG aircraft are currently being used” for ICE, which is consistent with the flight data for August 22. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for comment. ICE deferred to DHS.

	“It seems like a misuse of Coast Guard assets to me,” says Tom Cartwright, the retired JPMorgan executive who has been tracking ICE flights since 2020. “And you have to wonder why it's been kept so quiet.” 


	The Coast Guard, which is part of DHS, has a wide-ranging purview protecting U.S. maritime interests, which includes search-and-rescue missions, disaster response, and enforcing fishing laws. It also does drug and migrant interdiction, which generally means surveilling and intercepting suspected smuggling vessels in the water. 


	Coast Guard aircraft have been used for a handful of ICE flights in the past, but hauling prisoners across the country is far afield from its normal duties — particularly for the C-27, which until recently was primarily used for search and rescue.


	The C-27 missions follow a similar pattern, leaving their stations in Clearwater, Fla., or Sacramento, Calif., flying to the ICE hubs of Alexandria or Harlingen, and spending the next week flying out-and-back trips to midsize cities like Baltimore, Cincinnati, Jacksonville, Kansas City, and Tampa — “NFL cities,” as one activist, “JJ in DC,” describes them — where ICE has been active. Of eight Coast Guard C-27s that have operated since mid-June, all but one appears to have been dedicated to ICE flights. They have landed at the tent camp in the Everglades nine times beginning on July 23 and as recently as Thursday.

	The trips have become so regular that JJ in DC was able to figure out their schedule and predict their next moves. 


Rolling Stone went to a public parking lot next to a loading area at the back of Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on August 13 to observe an incoming C-27.


	Once it landed and taxied to the loading area, the aircraft's back ramp opened and three vehicles pulled up toward it — an unmarked van, an unmarked SUV, and an SUV with a DHS seal. Federal agents and guards removed a shackled man from the aircraft and put him into the DHS SUV. Agents spent about an hour signing paperwork, chatting, and loading plastic bags holding immigrants' belongings into the aircraft, while a Coast Guard pilot did a walk-around safety check for the next flight. 

	











	An agent carried an armful of chains to the van, and a short time later, seven people shackled at the hands and ankles were led from the van to the aircraft's ramp, where they were patted down. All of them appeared to be men, ranging in age from late teens to forties. All appeared to be brown or Latino. 


	Once they were loaded onto the aircraft, the shackled man in the marked SUV was moved again to the unmarked van. Soon afterward, the agents appeared to notice they were being filmed from the public parking lot and put on hoodies and balaclavas. Two marched toward the fence dividing the loading area from the lot and filmed a random guy who had just parked there.


	The man removed from the C-27 and one of the men loaded onto it were wearing gray sweatsuits often issued to immigrants in detention centers, while the other men were wearing their own clothes, suggesting ICE was transporting a mix of people who had been in their custody for some time and some who had been recently arrested. 


	On August 22, the C-27 parked in an area farther away from the public parking lot. About nine people in unidentified uniforms got off the aircraft from the boarding door and walked to a nearby charter jet. Federal agents then loaded several shackled people, at least one in a gray sweatsuit, up the back ramp. The charter jet flew to Charlotte, N.C.; the C-27 returned to Alexandria. 


	In addition to the midsize cities, Coast Guard has apparently operated ICE flights to these cities since late June: Biloxi, Mississippi; Columbus, Georgia; Dallas; Hot Springs, Arkansas; Indianapolis; Knoxville, Tennessee; San Antonio; Springfield, Missouri; and Tallahassee. All are near ICE detention facilities.


	Immigrants have long reported harsh conditions, safety problems and physical, verbal, and sexual abuse by guards onboard ICE flights. Like the men in Baltimore, all adult passengers on ICE flights are shackled at the wrists and ankles. (This may be the case for some immigrant children, too.)


	Flight attendants for GlobalX, which currently operates the majority of ICE flights, told ProPublica in April that when they raised concerns about how shackled passengers could safely evacuate in the event of an emergency, they were told to “just get up and leave.” In July, activists watching a Seattle airport livestream spotted ICE-contracted guards push to the ground a shackled immigrant with a hood over his head while boarding an ICE flight on Avelo Airlines.

	











	Which detention centers people in ICE custody are transferred to is based largely on capacity, according to the agency, which often results in people being moved multiple times and hundreds or thousands of miles away from their homes. Advocacy groups say this cuts off immigrants from their families and legal assistance, and that frequent and capricious transfers can be used to punish people in ICE custody.


	“We're told that it is a question of logistics, sometimes it often appears that these transfers may be retaliatory in nature, because people are trying to access counsel,” says Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project. “There is also a suspicion that authorities may be transferring people for more favorable case law in different areas of the country.”


	For example, when Georgetown professor Badar Khan Suri was detained in March on specious allegations of ties to Hamas, he was sent on a week-long journey to five different facilities, each farther away from his home in Arlington, Virginia, according to court documents. He ended up in a dirty, overcrowded facility in Alvarado, Texas, despite there being plenty of room at two of the facilities in Virginia where he was briefly held. (Suri was released in May and settled a lawsuit with the Trump administration earlier this month.)


	In another case first reported by Capital B News, Haitian national Rony Dieujuste was moved from Palm Beach County to Miami, then to Texas, Arizona, and California. At one facility, he and other detainees had unexplained nosebleeds; at another he slept on a bare metal platform. His American partner struggled to keep tabs on him using ICE's detainee locator system and would only find out he'd been moved when he called her from a new facility, often in the middle of the night. 


	“I told him to remain strong. But he is breaking,” she told Capital B in June.


	“It takes a huge toll on families, especially when they're so far away,” Cho says. “It's as if somebody has died or has disappeared.”


	It is unclear how many times on average immigrants in ICE detention are transferred before their cases are resolved, because ICE does not release this data. Nor does it release data about its massive — and growing — air operation. 


	It's that lack of transparency that compelled Cartwright, the former JPMorgan exec, to start tracking ICE flights nearly six years ago. He releases meticulous monthly reports frequently cited by the media. 

	











	“I just believe the public has a right to know what the scale of this operation is,” he says. “When things are opaque like this and basically totally dark, no one thinks about the people on the planes.”


	Cartwright began noticing the Coast Guard's presence in Alexandria and Harlingen in July, but did not include those flights in his statistics for the month because he wasn't yet sure they were ICE flights. Now he is certain, he says, and he and Human Rights First — the nonprofit he recently announced is taking over his flight-tracking operation — are working to amend the June and July reports to include them. Even before the additions, Cartwright recorded more ICE flights in July than ever before — 727 domestic transfer flights and 207 deportation and third-country removal flights — on ICE's network of charter airlines, private jets, and a growing number of military aircraft. 


	Cartwright also noted that when the Coast Guard assisted ICE in the past, it released public statements about that assistance. This time, the Coast Guard appears to have adopted ICE's stance of saying little.


	On Wednesday, NBC News reported that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wanted to use billions in funding from Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” for ICE to buy and operate its own fleet of 30 or more aircraft. That same day, Air Force members received an email, obtained by journalist Marisa Kabas, inviting them to take part in a program “supporting border operations.”


	Noem has been living rent-free in a spacious home designated for the Coast Guard commandant, The Washington Post reported last week. Trump fired the previous commandant, Admiral Linda Fagan, on the second day of his second term, accusing her of an “excessive focus” on diversity, equity, and inclusion.

	In May, Noem delivered the commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. Dozens of nearby protesters held signs decrying the crackdown on immigrants, telling reporters their beef was with Noem, not the Coast Guard.


	“Congratulations,” Noem told the cadets. “You're the first graduating class of a brand-new Coast Guard.”

	A day after his younger brother Erik was denied release on parole, Lyle Menendez was handed the same fate on Friday evening, with California prison officials ruling he remains a risk to public safety. It was a minimal denial of three years.


	“We find your remorse is genuine. In many ways, you look like you've been a model inmate. … But despite all those outward positives, we see [that] you still struggle with anti-social personality traits like deception, minimization, and rule-breaking that lie beneath that positive surface,” Parole Commissioner Julie Garland said, wrapping up the marathon hearing that lasted more than 11 hours.


	Friday's decision means both brothers will remain in custody pending follow-up parole hearings in the coming years, or movement on their separate habeas petition seeking a new trial. (The brothers also have a clemency bid waiting on Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk, but with the parole board finding they're not yet fully rehabilitated, that avenue appears unlikely to succeed, at least for now.)

	











	The brothers, whose Nineties notoriety reignited last year thanks to the popular Ryan Murphy-created Netflix series, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, are currently serving revised sentences of 50 years to life for the grisly shotgun murders of their parents, José and Kitty Menendez, inside the family's Beverly Hills mansion on Aug. 20, 1989. On Friday, Lyle was openly emotional as he appeared by video from his San Diego prison. He apologized for the brutal killings and took responsibility for the “pain” he caused his surviving relatives, who now vocally support his release. He said the decision to turn violent was his, not his “baby brother's.”

	“My Mom and Dad did not have to die that day,” he said through tears. “I'm profoundly sorry for who I was … for the harm that everyone has endured.” 


	Lyle said he had an “honest belief” at the time of the double murder that his parents “were going to kill” him. He now understands they were unarmed, not posing an immediate threat. “Really, the only thought in my head was, it was happening now. I needed to get to the door first. Fear overwhelmed reason,” he said. “I don't have a great explanation for why I felt such terror in those moments.”

	At one point during the lengthy hearing, Lyle doubled over, crying and shaking, recalling a confrontation with Kitty shortly before the homicides. “I couldn't wrap my mind around the fact that she knew,” he said, referring to the alleged sexual abuse Lyle and Erik suffered at the hands of their father.


	As she rendered the board's decision, Garland said Lyle's violence was impulsive and showed “poor threat perception.” She called the reloading and final shot that killed Kitty extremely “callous.”


	The back-to-back hearings for Lyle, 57, and Erik, 54, gave the first detailed look at the brothers' disciplinary records behind bars. Both had numerous violations for using contraband cell phones, with Lyle having pleaded guilty to two such violations in November 2024 and March 2025, Deputy Parole Commissioner Patrick Reardon said. While both brothers told officials that they rationalized the use as not harming anyone, the commissioners pointed out that demand for and use of the devices corrupted and endangered prison staff, fellow inmates, and others. Lyle conceded he couldn't be sure his cellmates weren't using his phone for criminal activity.


	The hearings also rehashed details of the gruesome murders, though their goal was to evaluate the brothers' probability of committing future crimes, not relitigate the criminal case. Erik and Lyle's first trial, televised on CourtTV in 1993 and 1994, ended with two hung juries — one for each brother. The second trial, which wasn't broadcast, ended with first-degree murder convictions. The brothers were sentenced to life without parole in 1996. Their resentencing in May made them immediately eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law.

	During the criminal court trials, jurors heard that the brothers used fake identification to purchase two Mossberg shotguns from a sporting goods store in San Diego two days before the murders. Prosecutors said the brothers then opened fire with more than a dozen rounds of buckshot while their parents were watching TV on a couch in the family's den.

	











	Jurors saw horrific photos of the bloody crime scene. José was shot in the back of his head. Kitty was shot in the face at point-blank range as she was already wounded, bleeding, and trying to crawl away, prosecutors said. The brothers picked up all the shotgun shells, dumped the evidence, and then screamed “dramatically” during a 911 call claiming someone else murdered their parents, officials said. Prosecutors claimed the brothers carried out a cold-blooded, premeditated scheme to inherit their parents' money.


	During their hearings this week, Lyle and Erik said they lived in fear of their abusive parents. They claimed José sexually abused them both, while Kitty did nothing to stop it. Their relatives have rallied around them, corroborating claims José was inappropriate with his sons. At the brothers' first trial, as well as at a May 2025 hearing for resentencing, cousin Diane VanderMolen testified that she was a teenager visiting the Menendez home when an eight-year-old Lyle told her his father was touching his genitals. VanderMolen said she tried to warn Kitty, but she was rebuffed.


	At his separate hearing Thursday, Erik testified that José sexually assaulted him repeatedly. He said that on the night of the murders, his dad ordered him to his room, saying he would be upstairs soon. Erik said he believed José was about to rape him, so he ran to get his shotgun, believing it was his only option to stop the abuse. “If he was alive, that was going to happen,” he said, referring to the alleged abuse. He recalled thinking that if he tried to run or expose the family's dark secret, his life would be in danger. “In my mind, leaving meant death,” he said.


	At Lyle's hearing Friday, Commissioner Garland started by asking how the alleged sexual abuse affected Lyle's decision-making skills. “It was confusing, caused a lot of shame in me. That pretty much characterized my relationship with my father,” he said. The abuse started when he was about six years old, he said, and lasted about two years. He recalled existing in a state of “hyper vigilance,” waiting and “not knowing when something would happen.” He might be molested in his bed, in a bathroom, or in a car, on any given day, he said.


	Lyle said the abuse stopped abruptly when he was eight, around the time his cousin Diane says she reported it to Kitty. “I think it's related to [José] being concerned that I would talk to people,” he said of the reprieve.

	











	Lyle said the abuse left him feeling a “total disconnection from everybody in my life growing up.” But in a twisted way, it also made him feel special. “I was the special son in my family. My brother was the castaway,” he explained to the board.


	Lyle said he got “more attention” from his father, particularly on the tennis court, than Erik did. But his father's fixation was intimidating. José “expected greatness,” lecturing him that he was from “a lion bloodline” while other people were “sheep,” he testified.


	“We were different. I wasn't weak like [José's] father. Or Erik. Or my mother. It was him and I in this bubble,” Lyle said, quoting his dad. When he eventually realized José had stopped molesting him, he was “a little bit amazed,” he said. “I worried a little bit that I was going to be less loved,” he told the board, saying he felt unsure at the time that he wanted it to stop.


	“I felt contaminated … but I felt love,” he said. “I wanted to believe my father loved me, so in my mind I felt like he was a great man, and my main way of dealing with it was that it was just a sickness that some great men have.” 


	Lyle said his father could be physically violent in the home as well, lashing out in terrifying attacks separate from the sexual abuse. José was “very brutal with physical abuse: choking, punching, closed fists, using a belt,” he said.


	“There was no love in it. It was just surviving that moment,” he recalled. Lyle's solidarity with his younger brother infuriated their dad, he said. Erik, meanwhile, bore the brunt of physical abuse in the home, he explained. The younger sibling was “openly punished, spanked, viciously. Thrown against things. My mother would drag him down the hall. I think I realized it was the two of us,” he said.


	In a notable departure from the well-known story of the Menendez murders, the commissioner then asked Lyle about his own abuse of Erik. The sensitive topic was raised at Erik's Thursday hearing as well, when Erik admitted he concealed from corrections staff that Lyle was “molesting [me] as a kid.”


	“I don't know why I did it. I think I was just trying to release it from me,” Lyle said. He described “pain training” sessions that were forced by his father, where he hurt Erik in a non-sexual way, as a possible form of pain endurance. The commissioner, who has access to confidential written records in the case, then moved on without clarifying the line of questioning.

	











	In another striking statement, Lyle said his mother sexually abused him as well. Garland replied that the accusation wasn't part of the comprehensive risk assessment the board received. Lyle let out a long sigh. “I didn't see it as abuse really. I just saw it as something special between my mother and I. So I don't like to talk about it that way,” he said. “Today, I see it as sexual abuse. When I was 13, I felt like I was consenting, and my mother was dealing with a lot, and I just felt like maybe it wasn't … it's abusive, but I never saw it that way, in the same way.” At that point, Lyle asked for a break, and the hearing moved to another topic.


	Garland asked Lyle about his suspension from Princeton for plagiarism, as well as his participation in a burglary with his brother more than a year before the murders. Lyle said he joined the burglary to keep an eye on his brother. He said afterward, José called him a “moron” for getting caught.


	When Garland asked why Lyle didn't talk about being disinherited by his parents in his submission to the board, Lyle said he believed “there was a will that disinherited us somewhere,” but it wasn't a motive for the murders. It only became “a problem afterwards,” he said, when they needed money once their parents were dead.


	Prosecutors claim the brothers murdered their parents out of greed. In a March filing opposing the brothers' resentencing, they focused on the brothers' “spending spree” in the months after the slayings. They said Lyle bought three Rolex watches, a Porsche, a condominium, a restaurant and “expensive clothes.” Erik bought a Rolex, a Jeep and hired “an expensive tennis coach for private lessons,” they said.


	Lyle told the board that the flashy purchases made him feel good in the moment, lifting him out his anguish. “My life had just collapsed without my parents,” he said.


	Lyle flatly denied that the murders were planned. He said buying the guns made the fatal shooting “more likely,” but he thought it was “de-escalating” at the time, meaning something that gave him a “measure of safety” and “emotional protection.”


	“There was zero planning. There was no way to know it was going to happen Sunday,” he said. The two brothers discussed their belief José had threatened to harm them if the family's secret “ever got out,” but they had no plan to kill their parents when they bought the guns, Lyle said.

	











	He said after the murders, he dropped his gun and walked out of the room feeling “numb.” Lyle said his attempts to cover up the crime and recruit others to lie for his benefit were evidence of him “flailing,” not carrying out a sophisticated plan.


	Lyle said his mother's murder caused him the most sorrow because, after her death, he learned more about her life and difficult childhood, and “how much fear maybe she felt.” He learned from her therapist “that she felt shame,” he said.


	Asked about his own psychology, Lyle pushed back on assessments that found he posed a “moderate risk” of violence if released and suffered from “anti-social, narcissistic traits.” He said his dad was a narcissist, but he pursues self-reflection and tries to “understand” his personality. He considers himself empathetic, he said, pointing to his work with inmates convicted of sex abuse. “My life has been defined by extreme violence. I wanted to be defined by something else,” Lyle said, in tears. 


	When Garland asked Lyle about his recent romantic correspondence with three different women, Lyle said he remains closest to his wife, though they're no longer romantically involved.


	L.A. County Deputy District Attorney Ethan Millius argued Lyle's cell phone violations while leading the Men's Advisory Council at his prison proves he “struggles with honesty.” He said Lyle had eight violations in custody for which he was found guilty, though he conceded they were non-violent. “There is no growth. It is just who Lyle appears to be,” Milius told the board in his closing argument Friday.


	District Attorney Nathan Hochman, Millius' boss, has made opposition to the Menendez brothers‘ release on parole a mainstay of his administration. “For more than three decades, both Erik and Lyle Menendez have advanced a false claim of self-defense, alleging they feared their parents were going to kill them, to justify the brutal murders of their parents,” he said in statement Thursday.


	But members of the Menendez family, including elderly sisters of both José and Kitty, have testified on the brothers' behalf, saying they forgive Erik and Lyle and want them home. Anamaria Baralt, the niece of José Menendez, delivered a victim statement Friday, “begging” the commissioners to release Lyle in time for his ailing aunts to see him outside the prison walls. “Make this torture end. This 36-year nightmare. Let us put it behind us,” she said.

	











	Baralt said she once witnessed José tie Erik's legs together to correct an error with his swimming form. She claims Erik almost drowned as she and Lyle watched in horror.


	“I believe, that they believe, that nobody was going to protect them,” she told the board. “I've heard so many times over the last 35 years, ‘Why didn't they just leave?' And thankfully, the criminal justice system has started to catch up with the brain science that trauma and childhood abuse create the illusion that there would have been no escape for Erik and Lyle.”


	Friday's hearing was thrown into disarray around 5 p.m. when Lyle and Erik's lawyer, Heidi Rummel, interrupted the proceeding to say audio from Erik's parole board examination on Thursday had been published by ABC News. In a series of clips posted online, Erik was heard describing the decision to buy the guns and open fire on his parents.


	Rummel suggested the audio was somehow leaked in violation of the family's legal rights. She questioned the fairness of both hearings and asked that Lyle's proceeding be adjourned. Commissioner Garland said an interpretation of the public records act allowed the release, but she wasn't sure how long that policy had been in place. It appeared ABC was the only outlet that received the recordings.

	After a lengthy break, Garland confirmed that no audio from Lyle's hearing would be released until Rummel had an opportunity to file something to contest its release. The hearing then resumed with a curtailed statement from José's sister, Teresita Baralt. The brothers' 85-year-old aunt kept it short, saying she wasn't comfortable reading her pre-written statement into the public record given the audio situation.


	“I want my nephew to hear how much I love him, and believe in him,” she said in tears. “I'm very proud of him, and I want him to come home.”

Times-News engraver Vic Goertzen drew this rendition of a flying saucer L.W. Hawkins and his sons said they saw flying in August 1947 in the Snake River Canyon near Auger Falls.

TWIN FALLS — Kelly Klaas was driving on U.S. Highway 93 north of the Snake River Canyon years ago when he saw a lighted object that appeared to take off from the runway of the Twin Falls airport, going at an “unbelievable” rate of speed.

The whole incident was over in three seconds, Klaas estimated.

What was it? He doesn't know.

“It might have been a reflection on my windshield,” he told the Times-News, “but it looked real.”

On another occasion, he was riding his Harley Davidson on Kimberly Road on a summer night when he said he saw a luminous globe about three feet in diameter keeping pace with him.

“To this day, I have no idea what it was,” he said.

UFOs have been part of Idaho's lore for years, and the Gem State has been identified as a top spot to see strange lights in the sky — the No. 3 state — according to one recent study using data from the National UFO Reporting Center.

The site concluded Idaho had 319 reported UFO sightings from 2020 to 2024, for almost 32 sightings per one million residents each year.

One of the most famous sightings involving the Gem State didn't occur in Idaho at all, but involved an Idaho pilot flying in 1947 near Mount Rainer in Washington.

Pilot Kenneth Arnold's description of nine disc-shaped objects flying in formation coined the term “flying saucer.”

The event caused a mild sensation in southern Idaho. Not much later, teenagers were suspected of throwing a model flying saucer they constructed into someone's backyard, and officers were called to investigate the hoax.

Then, about a month later, flying saucers were reported at Salmon Dam and the Snake River Canyon.

Twin Falls County Commissioner L.S. Hawkins, a former county sheriff, said he spotted two flying saucers over Salmon Falls Dam near Rogerson on Aug. 13, 1947. On the same day, A.C. Urie described an extremely fast object he and his sons said they saw near the bottom of the Snake River Canyon.

How fast did it go? They estimated 1,000 mph.

While those events occurred decades ago, such sightings are still reported today.

The month of August at 9 p.m. is a popular time for UFO sightings, as the number of sightings rises in the summer, presumably because people spend more time outside.

One of the latest reports filed with the National UFO Reporting Center said an individual on July 27 saw one near Albion. The witness described it as “a big bright light, 10 times larger than any star. Then split into six big lights forming a perfect circle. Later a square and triangle.”

Not all sightings are at night.

Sam Roundy said he had an encounter about 35 years ago when he was playing catch with his brother in Rupert.

“It was a sunny day and we felt a shadow come upon us but no noise,” Roundy wrote to the Times-News. They looked up and saw an object similar to an SR-72 spy plane, and the object quickly flew away without any memorable noise.

“It definitely moved faster than any earthly object,” he said.

He and his brother questioned what they saw that day, Roundy said, adding that he would enjoy having a similar experience again.

By July 1947, sightings of flying saucers had been reported in every state but five.

The term UFO might stir up thoughts of flying saucers manned by little green men, the truth might be somewhat less exciting — most of them are later identified as drones, weather balloons, spy planes, satellites, rockets and planets, according to a 2024 report from the military, which calls them UAPs, short for unidentified anomalous phenomena.

People posting on social media sometimes blame the military, namely the nearby Mountain Home Air Force Base, as being a source of unidentified things in the Magic Valley sky, but a person in public affairs said he'd been at the base for two years and hasn't heard questions from callers about UFOs.

There are groups in the state interested in discussing the topic of UFOs.

Lori Bradfield, Idaho state director of MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) in Boise, said Idaho doesn't get close to the number of UFO sightings as more populated states such as California. The Idaho group, however, meets regularly, and anywhere from five to 15 people show up.

“Not a huge turnout,” Bradfield said.

MUFON is a global group established in 1969 to investigate reported sightings.

A Facebook page titled MUFON Southern Idaho claims 450 members around the country, but Bradfield said it is not officially recognized by MUFON. She is, however, looking for someone willing to investigate sightings in Magic Valley.

UFO sightings and the existence of aliens have been a point of contention for many years, with more than half of Americans believing the U.S. government is hiding information regarding UFOs and alien life, according to a recent YouGov survey.

Magic Valley resident Sabrina Meline, who served in the Army, believes the government possesses alien crafts and has reverse-engineered them.

The military is now flying such crafts of its own, Meline said.

Her UFO experience didn't come from Idaho but near the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico in the 1990s. She called the remote area “a great place to test flying machines.”

As she looked at Holloman Air Force Base near the missile range, she saw a lit-up baseball field, but realized the field's lights weren't on, she said. The light was coming from a hovering object that was not like anything from a military helicopter.

“Then it took off,” Meline said. “It went from standing still to a streak of light like you'd see in a Star Wars movie.”

She called the experience “mind-numbing.”

Meline said it is possible some of the craft with alien origins are being tested near Mountain Home Air Force base.

“I have noticed there are a ton of people in Idaho seeing stuff,” she wrote to the Times-News.

An F-15E Strike Eagle assigned to 366th Fighter Wing, Mountain Home Air Force Base takes off Oct. 19, 2023, from Nellis AFB in Nevada.

A written statement provided to the Times-News from the Mountain Home Air Force base, however, said the base flies F-15s, a fighter jet that first entered service in the U.S. Air Force in the 1970s.

“We do not have any other flying units or platforms at our installation,” the statement said.

A 2023 congressional subcommittee hearing on national security brought a few audible gasps when former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer Retired Maj. David Grusch testified that the U.S. government has for years operated a reverse-engineering program of recovered alien craft.

As a further shocker, Grusch said the government had recovered non-human “biologics” from crash locations.

Former Navy fighter pilot Ryan Graves told the committee that the number of UAPs detected in U.S. airspace is vastly underreported due to pilots fearing professional repercussions.

Graves was an F-18 pilot when an upgrade to the Navy planes' radar systems alerted pilots to UAPs. On one occasion, a dark object came 50 feet from one of the aircraft.

At the end of the nearly three-hour hearing, Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., chairman of the House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security, said the hearing was “illuminating” and looked to find more answers in a more confidential setting, as well as make more information public.

Although acknowledging some sightings deserve further investigation — and video has been released of pilot encounters — the Department of Defense said there is no proof of life from another planet being involved.

UFO whistleblowers say witnesses have been silenced and even murdered, according to a claim now drawing FBI attention.

With vibes taken from a David Fincher series, fused with an episode of The X Files, the 1966 Westhall Incident in Melbourne, Australia, is one of the biggest mysteries in UFO lore.

Within an hour of seeing a flying saucer in the sky, army personnel turned up at a school to cordon off the woodland area.

By and by, alleged “men in black” showed up and scorned the children in the principal's office for fear they would consider blabbing.

The story shifted from being about a flying saucer in the sky into an allegory about intimidation and secrecy.

Documentation regarding the event is still missing from the army, and it remains a cold case.

There has been no mention of murders in Australia regarding the 1966 event, but in the US, cold cases may tell a different story.

For the first time ever, an FBI director is reportedly investigating whether UFO witnesses have been bumped off to diminish a case.

Kash Patel's background in intelligence equips him as a unique investigator who can finally look into potential murders and cover-ups, albeit covertly.

Even if one case similar to that of the Australian affair uncovers a single dispatch, or homicide, of a witness, then the shift from conspiracy theory to criminal prosecution will be underway.

As you see in shows like True Crime or Mindhunter, this allows for the power to subpoena documents, compel testimony, and open federal murder investigations.

Perhaps the most prominent whistleblower of them all, David Grusch, crucially told Congress in July 2023 that he had “personal knowledge” of people going missing or being killed – in order to conceal UFO technology.

When pressed whether or not assassinations occurred, Grusch said he would only reveal these kinds of details in a classified setting.

Matthew Brown went one step further on the weaponized podcast by claiming “lethal actions were taken” against individuals who “knew too much.”

The thing is, as ambiguous as these words sound, the whistleblowers fear a myriad of possibilities – becoming irrelevant being the least of their worries.

Matthew Brown said on the same podcast: ""If all of us die or are imprisoned, the seeds have been planted, and more will come,” which suggests a ruptured whistleblower community.

Fear is the first weapon, as demonstrated by the 1966 case. If the men-in-black intimidation stories are true, then the bite behind the bark of “forget what you saw” needn't be a myth.

When fear isn't enough, records disappear, pilots disappear from registries, and evidence is scrubbed from archives.

It's nearly impossible to pin down names or numbers, but the fact that so many whistleblowers come from the military makes them uniquely vulnerable.

Careers can be derailed, reputations destroyed, and in the darkest allegations, lives cut short.

Hence, the need for a thorough investigation sooner or later. Could Patel's efforts be a defining moment? Only time will tell.

The Singju Post

Read the full transcript of American politician and Air Force veteran Rep. Anna Paulina Luna's interview on The Joe Rogan Experience Podcast #2365, August 13, 2025. 

Early Military Encounters with UAPs


JOE ROGAN: So what did you think about the whole UFO thing before you got in the office?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So I actually had, when I was stationed at Portland Air National Guard, my job there was an airfield manager. So I would interface and work a lot with the F-15 pilots at the unit. And so there had been an airspace incursion that had taken place when I was still at the time at the Guard.

And I remember talking to some of the pilots about it and I was like, “What was that?” And they're like, “We can't really talk about it.” No one really wanted to address it. And so from what I had gathered, that had been likely a UAP. And so that kind of was my perspective.

Granted, I also grew up in the generation of the X-Files. And you know, I don't know if you remember '94 Independence Day. So like, for me specifically, I didn't look at it with a crazy lens and perspective. I'm like, you know, you never know if we're the only ones out there, essentially.

JOE ROGAN: But why did you assume that if it's a top secret incursion that he couldn't talk about, that it wasn't just a military craft from another country?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Because of the way that he was discussing it.

JOE ROGAN: How did he, what did he say?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So he didn't want to, from what I gather, get taken off flight status. And he's like, “I really can't discuss it. We couldn't really identify it essentially.” And it had outperformed them.

And so that was my first from a military perspective, experience with someone who basically, you know, there's a stigma within the flight community.

JOE ROGAN: But doesn't he have instrumentation on his jet?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, at the time, right. So an older platform, but he really didn't want to even talk about it.

The Eglin Air Force Base Investigation


And I bring that up because now with our investigation and the task force that I run, actually the reason why the task force was formed was because of an event that happened at Eglin Air Force Base where both myself, Representative Matt Gaetz, and Representative Tim Burchett actually had responded and gone to investigate multiple Air Force pilots that had come forward in regards to UAP incidences that had occurred. And they were alleging that the Air Force was covering it up.

JOE ROGAN: Interesting.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yes, that was that. And I'm happy to go into detail on that one. But what I will tell you is the stuff that I saw at Eglin, how the military responded, me being a former service member, and then ultimately what I saw with the pushback of the military not even wanting to share with Congress information, which is a big problem because when you have Congress that's supposed to be the advocate and voice for the American people, the oversight body, and you're being denied access not just from a base commander, but high level up at the Pentagon, even Secretary of Defense, it's a problem.

Advanced Technology and Physics-Defying Capabilities


JOE ROGAN: Do you think that it's possible that these are U.S. vehicles that are top secret?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I definitely think that there's a level of advanced technology that the US Government has and I think that that tech can be housed within the defense contract realm. And of course some information is going to be classified.

But I can also tell you, and this might sound crazy, but based on our investigations and stuff that we've seen, there is definitely something that I think would rival what we know currently with physics and a tech that potentially is out there that we don't have the ability to reproduce because it would basically be like dropping a cell phone back during the time of maybe caveman. So we just don't have the tech to develop it yet.

What I can also tell you is based on our interviews, and this has been something that you can go back and watch with the congressional hearings, but I was actually able to ask some of the witnesses, “What are these things?” And they keep saying interdimensional.

And then when you talk about the interdimensional aspect of preexisting, maybe outside of what we currently know as our own dimension, that stuff can all sound crazy. But at the end of the day, my job as an investigator is to receive all the information, decipher it, and then ultimately, from a congressional aspect, if you do have contractors that are withholding information or operating outside of the purview of the federal government, I mean, there's budgetary issues, but there's definitely something that I can tell you with confidence that exists that we don't know how to explain currently.

JOE ROGAN: So when you say that it operates outside our understanding of physics, what specifically are you saying?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Like, what happened to, I guess, break it down in simple terms is that I think that some of the tech that exists, that whatever these things have, these energy things. They call them interdimensional beings, I think that they can actually operate through the time spaces that we currently have.

And that's not something that I came up with on my own. That's based on stuff that we've seen, that's based on information that we've been told. And then also too, I think that there's this historical aspect of, you know, this gets into the deeper theories and concepts of religion and I think the history that we currently know.

And that spins off into another topic of, you know, you have the modern day Bible, you have this aspect of bibles that are books of the Bible that have been removed that explain and touch on these topics. I think that we're in a time and age where you have such a vast amount of information that we have access to via social media, via your cell phone, via the Internet. And so it's really changing the way that we understand the origins of life and the spiritual reality that we know.

Witness Testimony and Evidence


JOE ROGAN: When you say interdimensional beings, that they know that these are interdimensional beings, how do they know that?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So based on testimony, would be based on witnesses that have come forward. But what I can tell you is…

JOE ROGAN: Two witnesses just were told that they were?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: No. That they've seen things. And what I can tell you without getting into classified conversations is that there have been incidences that I believe where very credible people have reported that there have been movement outside of time and space.

JOE ROGAN: That's very vague.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: So unfortunately.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, yeah. Look, have I seen a portal open? No. Have I seen a spaceship personally? No. Have I seen evidence of this? Yes. Have I seen photo documentation of aircraft that I believe were not made by mankind? Yes. Is there historical significance to this? Yes. Is there multiple events that go back to, I would argue, maybe even before the time of Christ that have documented this in text? Yes.

So do I believe that the government has access to certain technology? Yes, to an extent. And I believe that certain contractors potentially have back engineered this tech. I think that that's what can explain the advancements that we're seeing.

But I also believe that this is a dangerous level of hidden information from the American people. Because if you have an aspect of the federal government which I can tell you, I, with two other members of Congress, were denied access to information at Eglin Air Force Base pertaining to whistleblowers because of the fact. And we can get into that story and what happened at Eglin in a second, but we were denied access and told that we don't have security clearance or the read-in authority on a special access program.

That's a problem because I'm supposed to represent and be an investigative body. And you have then people who are unelected that are operating basically in secrecy. And that's a problem. That's a big problem.

Intelligence Community Overreach


JOE ROGAN: And so how do these people have the authority to do that?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I think it's been decades of classified secret information and also this aspect of the intelligence community that's been empowered and it's serendipitous with timing, because when you talk about the intelligence communities and what they've done essentially to the trust in this country with the American people, I think this goes all the way back even into JFK, with how they basically have operated outside of the purview of Congress and basically, to an extent, have gone rogue. Up until recently. You're seeing a big push and pull to try to rein in these intelligence agencies currently.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. So I want to bring it back to evidence. You said that you've seen evidence. Like what kind of evidence have you seen?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I have seen photos. I have seen…

JOE ROGAN: What have you seen photos of?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So I was in a SCIF and I can't discuss all that was in a SCIF. But what I can tell you is based on the photos that I've seen, I'm very confident that there's things out there that have not been created by mankind.

JOE ROGAN: It seems crazy that people have access to information that shows that there's something outside of us that is more intelligent, at least more capable than we are, and they hide it from everybody else.

Government Disinformation and Project Blue Book


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: What I can tell you is that when you have thousands upon thousands of people around the planet throughout time that have reported something, right? To say that those people are crazy, to say that, you know, the whole concept of even just asking the question, that you might not necessarily be psychologically sound, that in itself, you know, that's a disinformation campaign to get people to shut up about it. And that's a problem. We know that the US Government has not exactly been clean. And a lot of what they've done with the American people, specifically to the topic of UFOs, you have…

JOE ROGAN: Which makes you think that it's probably because there's something there. If you think about the motivation they had with Project Blue Book, when J. Allen Hynek was running Project Blue Book, this specific intention was to discredit all stories.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And he ended up ultimately, though, after all of his investigations, becoming someone that was like, “I think there's something here.” But that's true, by the way. A lot of people might not necessarily go onto Google and look up that information, but you can actually look up the declassified reports from Project Blue Book.

What's also interesting, though, is when we're talking about tech, right? The ability for this tech being that it exists to change dependence for entire governments on things like fossil fuel, et cetera, you know, it's… Look, I think everyone has a moral obligation to do what they think is right, okay?

And so if you're in a position of power and you see something wrong and you're not addressing it, I think, you know, this in itself, getting the truth out there for people to decide for themselves. I'm not telling you what to believe. I'm just telling you in our investigations and what we are pushing for in regards to transparency, I would like to see the federal government roll out some of the stuff that we've been given access to, because I think that that information belongs in the hands of the American people.

And it's not even just the US Government. I mean, there's other countries around the world that have done certain things like this. Now, look, I've had a lot of crazy people show up at my office and say, you know, “I've been to Mars. You know, I have a chip in my brain.” All this stuff.

JOE ROGAN: They all have chips.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We had this one guy that showed up that was trying to give us a USB. He's like, “Put this in your computer. They're going to kill me for this,” runs away. And I'm like, “I'm not putting that in my computer.”

But based on our investigations, what I will tell you is, you know, there's been two members of Congress that are actually helping to lead out these investigations with me. And the reason I say that is because up until last Congress, if you even said the word UAP or UFO, people actually told us that if we went forward with these investigations that we were going to ruin our political careers.

And so, you know, we're in the mindset of, “Well, why wouldn't we ask these questions?” And also too, if no one wants to touch it, there has to be something here. Right?

JOE ROGAN: Right.

UAP Investigations and Congressional Transparency


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And so in these investigations, I mean, the amount of people that will come up to us, very successful people, to multiple members of Congress that believe the same thing, it's definitely changed in regards to the stigma that used to exist about disclosure and all this.

And so what we're trying to do currently was there's a big documentary that was filmed about a year and a half ago. And we're trying to get a screening up on Capitol Hill. But look, I think a lot of people say, “Well, this is a distraction from everything else happening in the country right now.” And all I'm simply trying to say is it's not a distraction.

The people that are kind of helping to divulge all this information, you have an intelligence community, you know, Tulsi Gabbard, Radcliffe, Kash Patel, they have been truly, in regards to our other investigations, extremely transparent and wanting to get this information out. But it doesn't mean that within these intelligence communities there isn't pushback.

So part of the reason why the task force was formed pertaining to things like UAP, pertaining to things like the Jeffrey Epstein stuff, pertaining to things like the JFK, MLK and RFK investigations, is because even though we don't hold declassification authority, what we're trying to do is push these agencies and be, if you will, the pit bull and the attack dog on trying to get this information released. And to a lot of these agencies, credit to them, they've been extremely transparent. And we have gotten one specifically on the JFK stuff and we're still looking to declassify and ask specifically on the UAP topic.

JOE ROGAN: What would be the rationale for keeping a photograph of a known absolute, not of this world craft from the American people or from the world? Why would anybody think that that would be the smart thing to do is to limit the access of that information to a very small amount of people?

Faith, Disclosure, and Government Secrecy


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I think that part of the fear is that you have advisors that think that, you know, the American people or humanity might not be able to handle it. There's this protective complex. But then also too, I think when you are talking about these things for a lot of people, I think that it kind of can rock your world a little bit in regards to where you stand in a faith perspective and then also to an aspect of, “Well, how do you even begin to explain it?”

And all I'm going to say is look, and we can go into some of the books that were removed from what we know as the modern day Bible. But I read through the book of Enoch multiple times. And I'm not saying that these things are angels. Okay, that's not at all what I'm saying. But what I am saying is that depending on where you are in regards to your whole perspective on whether or not God exists, I believe in God, I'm a Christian, there has to have been and there's admission that there was other creations that God made, but that we were the most prized creation.

And so I think that this can open up a bigger topic of discussion. What I will say is that what's been interesting is, and I've had a mass array of people that have come in, right. We have people that come in that claim that you can use this ability to basically dog whistle these things in from a psychic ability.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I've heard people say that.

Interdimensional Phenomena and Government Research


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And I think that there's something there. Otherwise they wouldn't necessarily be able to provide some of the video evidence that they have. But then that also brings up the question of if these things are interdimensional, which we've had witnesses testify to, to members of Congress and that was all publicly out there, that would then bring up the whole, “Well, if this is really transcending dimension, the power of what you say, thought, all of that.”

And then, you know, you can look into our own government's declassified documents that the CIA had on different experiments. I mean you can literally, last week I was going through actually on a Friday night, just put my son down and I was going through some of the declassified documents. You go to CIA.gov reading room and you can see all the declassified documents.

And so I believe it's called Stargate and it was talking about, you know, the basically psychological experiments where they were trying to basically remote view and all that. Why would our own government be looking into that if there wasn't something there? And so I'm appreciative to all that information being publicly out there. But I think this whole idea and stigma of trying to make it sound crazy when people actually have these questions that needs to stop, which is why the task force is in existence. And then also too they need to release information.

JOE ROGAN: If I was going to play devil's advocate, I would say that the government would look into that to find out if there's anything there. And that would probably take a long time if they're really being careful. So if I was going to fund a program, if someone told me that there's some people in Russia that can remote view military sites in America, I'd be like, “Are you sure?” And like, “Yeah, yeah, there's a technique involved and we know the technique and we want to fund some sort of a study to see if we can do it,” I'm like, “Let's go. What do you need?” Because if maybe it's real.

So I don't buy that they wouldn't spend money on it unless it's real. I say they would spend money on it. To find out if you're really looking out for national security, right? You've got 300 plus million people that you're responsible for. You got to dot your I's and cross your T's. And if I'm good at my job and I'm not an egomaniac, I'm going to go, “Maybe there's some shit I don't know.”

Remote Viewing and Intelligence Operations


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, there's looking into it and then there's expanding, right? And so if you look at all those declassified files, you know, you can pull up and this is just wild, but there's one where I was looking through and they had basically, you know, the Coast Guard had called in. There was a ship that they had been given information on that was running drugs.

And so they called in one of their remote viewers and they're trying to give coordinates of the ship and actually locate these things. And actually I was laughing because I was reading this off the website and I'm telling my husband, “Imagine, you know, you're trying to run drugs and then all of a sudden you have some weirdo at Langley in a basement. They're like, ‘No, just here's the coordinates.' You know, beam me up, Scotty.”

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I don't know if they write things down or type them out or what, but I talked to Hal Puthoff about it and he said they used it to very specifically find the location of a downed Russian craft within a couple kilometers, which is nuts if you think about the area where this thing crashed. It's remote wilderness, the middle of nowhere. Russia hadn't found it yet. Apparently we found it first. According to Hal Puthoff.

It's just because I haven't done it, and because I don't know that it's real, doesn't mean it's not real. And this is a problem with people. They don't want to get duped and they don't want to look stupid. They don't want to look naive. And so they dismiss things. They dismiss that there might be frequencies that you don't tune into all the time, and someone might get really good at that and they might be able to see things remotely.

Telepathy and Consciousness Research


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I think that this gets into the bigger discussion of what do we know, right? Going back to some of these books that were moved, there's a good podcast right now called the Telepathy Tapes and it talks about how some non speaking or nonverbal autistic kids actually are exhibiting telepathy.

JOE ROGAN: You mean the Telepathy Tapes?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, sorry, the Telepathy Tapes. Nonverbal autistic kids are exhibiting telepathy. You know, this concept again, if you were to talk about it 20 years ago, people will call you crazy. But you know, I think based on what we're seeing now, based on the fact that our own government's looked into it, based on the stuff that you were saying, I mean, you can find all this information publicly available and it's out there and I think that there's something to it.

And so, you know, we're seeing, and we've heard this is in non classified settings, we've heard from people that have come forward that are saying, “You know, we're being able to via meditation, we're essentially downloading information and we can communicate with these things.” Granted, you know, when I'm sitting in my congressional office and I'm hearing this, I take it with a grain of salt because we do get a lot of crazy people.

But when you have people that are high level executives, very successful, clean cut, not on drugs, they're coming in and they're telling you this stuff and then, you know, you're kind of cross referencing it with various people in intelligence agencies, I just, I think that there's something there. We need to be at least open to hearing the discussion and the argument for these things.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, for sure. I mean, like I said, if there's a photo out there. I think you owe humanity a service. You're supposed to release that photograph. There's no reason why a small group of people in the government should have photo conclusive evidence that aliens are real. That's crazy.

David Grusch and Whistleblower Threats


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And there's an over classification aspect of this too, right? If you're serving in the military and you're taking a photo on your personal device or a video on your personal device, that shouldn't be the purview of the federal government and either which way, I mean, there's been now so much stuff. There's, granted there's been a lot of fake stuff put out there, but the stuff that is legitimate that we are seeing, the stuff that we had people testify to in our congressional hearings, I mean, that's not a joke.

And what's even more interesting to this is that I was actually able to talk to David Grusch, who now is actually working with the task force to kind of chase down a lot of these leads in regards to some of these contractors that allegedly have this tech, right? So in talking with him, again, not in a SCIF, we were able to actually flesh out that prior to him testifying that he actually received very real threats against his life and his wife's life. He's a sound guy.

And then shortly after he testified, there's this massive smear operation that was launched against him to try to discredit his testimony. And so, you know, again, going into, “Well, if this stuff wasn't real or if he wasn't telling the truth, why would there be this massively orchestrated effort to, you know, completely just disprove what he was trying to say or to discredit his actions and his testimony.”

And so it is kind of coming full circle, right? Going back to what the task force has been able to find out. I mean, we're conducting these investigations simultaneously and we're doing this in addition to everything that we have to do as members of Congress. Right. So although I would love to just dedicate my full time and attention to this, we still have to balance it out. And so I've again had some great investigators who are working with us on oversight, as well as a lot of cooperation from the intelligence agencies. And we are going to be asking for this information to be declassified, at least information that has been shown to us.

The Age of Disclosure Documentary


JOE ROGAN: I think the first break in the wall was that 2017 New York Times report where they were talking about it in logical, sensible language that these things might be from another world. But I think that movie that you're discussing, which is the Age of Disclosure, right?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, I haven't seen it. Have you seen it?

JOE ROGAN: It's very good. Yeah, it's very good. It's very good. And it doesn't even have any UFO footage. I mean, maybe a little bit.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's just testimony.

JOE ROGAN: It's just testimony. And at the end of it you kind of draw this conclusion like, “Oh, this makes sense.” What they're essentially saying is one of the problems is if they have been funding these secret programs, then for all these years they've been misappropriating money.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh yeah. And they've been lying to Congress.

Congressional Oversight and Accountability


JOE ROGAN: And that's super illegal.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Very illegal. But you know, is Congress going to do anything about it? Because it's not the first time. We have the ability, and this is the most frustrating thing.

So as a, this is my second term in Congress now, but as a first term member of Congress, you know, when you get elected to Congress, you would think that they would bring you in and they'd say, “Okay, this is how you do the legislation.” No, you get elected, you show up to kind of a crash course for about like a week and a half on how to not get in trouble with ethics and then you're basically wined and dined by lobbyists.

They don't actually tell you how to do the legislation. Basically the only rules that you're told are never vote down a rule which is a procedural motion to bring legislation to the floor and don't really ever vote against your party. Within the first week I broke both rules and so I was on the naughty list, per usual.

JOE ROGAN: They don't tell you how to do it. That's kind of crazy.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, they tell you basically those are the two rules and don't go against that and you won't have any issues.

JOE ROGAN: Those are big rules though.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, because it's like, you know, you're supposed to represent your constituency. So if you have people calling your office saying “don't you vote for this?” and then you vote against it, it's like people forget that you're supposed to represent. Right. Representative instead of just do what the party wants.

But you know, there are mechanisms that have existed since Thomas Jefferson who wrote our rule manual that enable us to actually pass legislation and actually hold agencies and people accountable from a punitive perspective. And I don't know if you were tracking, but I brought a vote on the former Attorney General for basically refusing to testify to Congress and respond to a subpoena. And that was called inherent contempt.

A lot of Congress was like, “What the hell is inherent contempt?” It hadn't been done since the early 1900s. And I actually read it in the rule manual, and I read the rule manual twice. So it's crazy what happens when you read books. But we were able to find this out, and it was a mechanism that Congress can use to actually basically send the sergeant at arms to go arrest people.

Mass Amnesty and Whistleblower Protection


JOE ROGAN: Okay, so one of the things that this documentary was calling for that I think is the only logical way to solve this is a mass amnesty for these people that misappropriated money and…

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Or whistleblowers.

JOE ROGAN: Or whistleblowers. The whistleblowers thing is crazy. They leave them alone. Come on. Of course. Everybody should know this stuff. The real crime is you keeping this secret from humanity. That's the real crime. Okay? The other stuff is horseshit. It's just interpretations of what you're writing down on paper. You're making up rules.

But if you ask the general public how they feel this should go, a rational, normal person would say, “There's no way the defense contractor should be the only people who know that we're not alone. Fuck you.”

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Especially when we're facing a massive deficit and you see that they're like, the Pentagon hasn't been able to pass the audit, and I don't know how many…

JOE ROGAN: All that stuff is great, but just for humanity. Just for humanity. That is a giant piece of information that no one should have. No one should secretly keep information that would change our entire perspective on our existence.

Congressional Resistance to Disclosure


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's definitely wrong that it's happening for sure. What I will tell you, though, is the issue that we have with bringing forward legislation that would give mass amnesty and pardon to these people is that there are people within the intelligence community and within Congress on both sides that will try to… If you come forward with this, and I'll tell you a very plain, prime example of this in a moment, that they will block it.

They don't want it to pass. They will stop it from even coming to the floor. They won't bring legislation that will address it because they want to keep this information secret. So, Representative Tim Burchett…

JOE ROGAN: Why do they want to keep the information secret?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Because I think that their mouthpiece is in control of the deep state, and that's a thing. And it exists on both sides, okay?

JOE ROGAN: So someone will come to them with marching orders.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: One hundred percent. Representative Tim Burchett, before I got elected, was kind of on his own little island in regards to the UAP stuff. And he will himself tell you that, you know, this is one hundred percent a thing, and that these defense contractors and what he believes, you know, the Pentagon not passing all these black budget programs.

He will tell you he's been leading out this effort way before I got there. He had a piece of legislation that was supposed to enable the FAA to report and develop a different reporting procedure for UAP stuff. And at the time, the chairman of intel ensured that that legislation was not brought forward, was stopped.

The piece of legislation that actually passed out of the Senate really had no teeth to it. And then Representative Burchett drew a primary challenger that was being backed by the chairman of Intel. And so, you know, when you are touching these, it's like that meme where you have that stork that's like, “don't touch this.” And then the little foot comes out. It's kind of like what we're doing.

And it's not exactly easy because you will take heat from both sides. But there has been a good group that's been assembled that's bicameral, meaning it's both in the House and the Senate, and bipartisan, meaning both Democrats and Republicans are saying this should actually happen.

JOE ROGAN: Are they publicly talking about not releasing the information or is all this stuff done in secrecy?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's done behind the scenes.

JOE ROGAN: Because if they had to do it publicly, if they had to announce their position on it publicly, it would be very damaging, I think, to anybody's political career on the right or the left.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: People would be pissed. Right?

JOE ROGAN: Well, they're pissed because I'm pissed, because if they've had it for this long, if they really did recover something as early as 1947…

Recent Developments and Briefings


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I can tell you for us specifically, we actually were made aware some people had come forward that said that they wanted to brief. So about two years ago, when all this kicked off, we had requested briefings from AARO, that's in charge of kind of compiling the investigative aspect of UAP stuff.

And by the way, from the get go, even in talking to AARO, I was like, “This organization is literally a BS organization. They're never going to tell us anything.” And every interaction that we had in the SCIF, I was like, “This is a nothing burger.”

But then these people came forward and said that they were actually denied. They were told to not brief our group specifically on this topic, and that it was from at the time, members of House leadership, but they wouldn't say who. And so I actually went with another member of Congress and confronted multiple people and they all denied denying us access. So it's done behind the scenes, you'll see these random little troll blockages that might pop up.

But what I can tell you is that with the new administration, specifically with the FBI, specifically with ODNI, we have gotten transparency to where previously we would have been stonewalled. We were actually given briefings. And so what I will tell you is we are going to push for the information that we sought to be out there for the American people to see.

The Disclosure Process


JOE ROGAN: So do you think that the whole idea of disclosure is maybe a multiple step, very agonizing, frustratingly slow process rather than a big dump of all the information that they've had from Roswell to the Aztec one to this? Apparently there's a whole slew. I don't know if it's Aztec, I forget the name of it. But there was another. During that same time period, there was a really prominent UFO recovery thing that was not as publicized as the one in Roswell.

The big mistake with the Roswell one was the newspaper printed it. So then they had to backtrack and then they had to do the press conference where they had scattered pieces of a weather balloon that didn't look anything like a UFO, and then there's nothing.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: But meanwhile they flew the wreckage to Wright Field. They flew the wreckage and Truman met them there, supposedly.

The Vandenberg Air Base Incident


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I can tell you in our hearing we were actually notified. And you can pull this up. I think it was one of the witnesses had talked about what had happened at Vandenberg Air Base where there was this thing that appeared over the base. It actually had multiple blotters reporting on it. It had phone calls into law enforcement from hundreds of people.

And whatever had appeared over the base was basically bigger than a football field and basically a cube, a red cube with some weird thing in the center of it. I actually had our witness draw this out. This guy is sober as a priest. I mean, was a great pilot. And he's talking about all this.

And so, you know, you talk about this. It seems like a sci-fi movie, but based on the evidence that we've seen, I don't have any reason to believe that these people are lying. Based on the evidence that I've seen from our own government, I think that there's something there that the American people deserve to have access to.

And so I've been… This is not just on this topic, but again in other topics as well. This has been my perspective: transparency is what builds trust. Other governments have revealed certain information on it. To think that we are the only life form on this planet or in this galaxy, I think is a little bit crazy given, you know, the fact that I also think God exists and that there's other creations.

But then again, you get into this aspect of, you know, why is it that you also have this aspect of a certain religion that has been very controlled and I think rolled out in a certain aspect. And you know, when you have certain books that are removed because they don't think that people should have access to this information or know it, you know, why remove a book from a Bible, right?

Biblical Texts and Hidden Knowledge


JOE ROGAN: Did Wes Hoff, did he touch on that? Did he talk about that? Are there people that don't believe the Book of Enoch was really a part of the Bible? I don't remember how he discussed the missing books. I think we brought it up, but I don't remember how. That's the guy to talk to.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, so what…

JOE ROGAN: That's the guy to talk to about, you know what I mean? Because you have to really understand the history of the Bible to be able to figure out what's legitimate, what's not, why they put it into the New Testament. I had some very erroneous ideas about it until I talked to intelligent people that really, really know the history of it. It's very strange stuff.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, so from what I gather, and by the way, I'm not a theologian in any capacity, but just from my personal opinion on this, so you have the Ethiopian Orthodox text, which has I think 88 books of the Bible in total, but in the Ethiopian Orthodox text it's basically kind of the mainline OG version of the Bible.

And then sometime in the 4th century there was actually a group that came together and they removed certain books. And the story goes that Revelations actually had replaced Enoch. And so it's interesting because when you're looking kind of full circle on, you know, you hear the stuff that some of these people are talking about and then you see and you read the Book of Enoch, which is a wild read, okay?

And then you look at kind of what our modern day description is of what angels and entities are versus what Enoch was seeing and reporting in his language and ability at that time. I just, I think that there's a lot that brings you to then ask the question, “Well, why would they remove this information, if it's truly, you know, written in part of the oldest Bible in the world, why would they then take it out and water it down?”

And I'm not saying that you can't find God through the new Bible, right? Everyone's on their own spiritual journey, and I think everyone can pray and you can access God. But I just find that very interesting. And so what I will say is that I want to have the whole kind of picture in front of me. And so I feel like to fully understand A through Z, you kind of have to be able to read it.

The Dead Sea Scrolls and Biblical Authenticity


JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I just don't know about the history of it. Is there any debate about the reality of that book? Is there any debate about whether or not it was either fraudulent or discredited or something? Yeah, like, why did they. Because I know there was some kind of controversy that Westhoff described. I just can't remember it.

I just looked through a transcript real quick. I didn't see you guys discussing Enoch. We were discussing Isaiah and then the Dead Sea Scrolls and stuff like that. I didn't see Enoch discussion. No. It must have been me privately talking to him about something. Another video that I watched.

The thing about what Wes Huff does that's so interesting is he really understands the history of the text, the language in which they used, the names in which they chose. And when he breaks it up, one of the things he told us that was the craziest was that the book of Isaiah was exactly the same in the Dead Sea Scrolls as it was a thousand years later. They found one that was a thousand years older and it was direct, it was word for word, verbatim. I'm like, that's bananas. A thousand year old story that's exactly the same written that they didn't know there was a version of it a thousand years ago. And then they find it in these.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Kids, it's confirmed, it's nuts.

JOE ROGAN: It's really weird. It's really, really weird stuff.

Religious Upbringing and Spiritual Beliefs


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And the fact that this kid, you know, shepherd kid, was able to even find these scrolls that they were set up and you know, just led to that point right in time where he finds this massive, basically admission that the Bible is real.

You can actually look into, you know, there's a new King James and then you can actually look into the Catholic Bible as well that also has, they call them Apocrypha texts because the King James Bible doesn't acknowledge them. But there are also other books that are not considered, you know, approved by the King James.

So look, I was on my mom's side, I was actually raised Catholic and then had my catechism, did all of it. And then on my dad's side I was raised Christian and then later on Messianic Jew. And so I feel like I kind of have like a good cross section. And I've been exposed to a lot of this growing up, but it's definitely interesting.

And so look, I don't tell people, like I'm not, I'm not saying that like aliens created mankind. I don't believe that because I at the end of the day believe that God is responsible for our creation. But I do think that what we've been programmed to believe in regards to our ability to be able to use our mind, the spiritual aspect of us really does exist.

And I think that once you kind of remove yourself out of this basically rat race and you can like really reconnect with that, I think that that's when you kind of realize, hey, there's a bigger purpose here in life and like, what is our end objective? And if you're given a position of influence or a position of power and you're not doing the right thing for humanity, you're not guiding people, then that's something that you have to answer for. So I want to make sure that I'm good with guidance.

Ancient Stories and Universal Truths


JOE ROGAN: I hear you. That's a lot. I think these stories, especially when you get to stories like Noah and the Ark, that these stories exist in basically every religion. They're real similar. They're real similar. I think all of these people are trying to document a truth. It's just. What is that? Truth is where it gets weird. And when it gets to like other gods and giants and giants created man.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, Enoch talks about that.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. Oh, I know.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Which is crazy. I know.

JOE ROGAN: It's wild. Wild stuff. If it's legitimate, it's wild stuff. And then do you know anything about the Ethiopian church that supposedly has the Ark of the Covenant in it?

The CIA's Remote Viewing of the Ark of the Covenant


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, I've looked into that. I actually wanted to. And again, you're in the government, you can like get somebody.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So I actually wanted to do a codel to just. But of course, like we're focusing on other things right now.

JOE ROGAN: Send these seals. Find that fucking seals.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I was like, I need to pay for this for myself. So we're not using tax free dollars, but just go check it out. What's interesting is the CIA allegedly located the Ark of the Covenant.

JOE ROGAN: I think the remote viewed.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They remote viewed it. You can actually find that. You should actually find that in Ethiopia. No, not in Ethiopia, but it was in a Middle Eastern country. They weren't able to locate the actual. I think the New York Post did an article on it where they actually have the handwritten notes on the Ark of the Covenant location and they remote viewed it. You should ask them to pull it up. Yeah, I'm serious about it.

JOE ROGAN: Did they go there and see if they were there?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I don't know. They did. I don't know. This is like Indiana Jones.

JOE ROGAN: Decades old CIA documents on Ark of the Covenant resurface amid classified group text spat. What?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Wait, like it was a group text.

JOE ROGAN: Argument that caused this stuff to be.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: No, check out. Pull up the New York Post one because they actually have the handwritten notes from the remote viewer that actually documents it.

JOE ROGAN: Okay.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It should be. I think it's like the New York Post.

JOE ROGAN: That's so funny.

Analyzing the CIA Documents


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, there you go. Top one. This is wild because it actually goes into descriptions of angels too. And so actually if so in Enoch it talks about. Well, if you scroll down now that's that you can probably click on the scribed because it'll show you all the documents from the actual declassified file. This is also on Cat.

JOE ROGAN: What year was this?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: This happened recently. This was like a couple months ago that this Just kind of came all out.

JOE ROGAN: Right. But what year Was this project?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: 1988.

JOE ROGAN: 88.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: 5. December 1988. Wow. So scroll down.

JOE ROGAN: So in 88, they found the Ark of the Covenant.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Allegedly. Allegedly. They remote viewed it. We don't know if they bought them.

JOE ROGAN: Who was president back then? Reagan.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Go down. Bush Senior. Okay, so scroll down and then you'll see that. So this is like. So they're going through in the notes. You have to read it, but you can scroll down. This is kind of.

JOE ROGAN: So this is. He's like drawing where it is the remote viewer.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So you have like the different things that are describing it. And if you keep going, you'll see like a cherubim. Keep going.

JOE ROGAN: It's like showing the peak of a wheel.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Wait, sorry. Go up a little bit. So that's interesting because if you look into actual. So there's like a wheel text. If you look into Enoch's description of angels and Ezekiel 2, I think that that's kind of a tie, but go down more.

So but yeah, you have like the actual. Here purpose of container. They should have like a cherubim drawing somewhere down here. Oh, yeah, I see. So that would be the seraphim. So it's just what, the seraphim, how it's opened. Yeah. So basically when they. They describe the Ark. And so he's going through describing. So these are the hand notes for. And then actually says that it's in the Middle Eastern country. The remote viewer describes the clothing in which individuals are in the area. I feel like I'm describing like an Indiana Jones movie. But this is actually from the CIA.

Skepticism About Remote Viewing Results


JOE ROGAN: This image. Scroll back to where that. What is that thing? Is that the corner of the box?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: The Covenant. Yeah. He's describing. If you go up and these are actually the handwritten notes on what was described by the remote viewer. And you have to go through the entire document. But yeah, that's what's described surrounding the Ark.

JOE ROGAN: Do you know what they asked him to find?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, yeah, the Ark of the Covenant. You can find it on the dock.

JOE ROGAN: You have to go look for the Ark.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: If you go higher up in the documents, it's over there.

JOE ROGAN: Right. But if you ask me to go look for the Ark of the Covenant, like, I know what I'm looking for. Right.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, apparently these remember what.

JOE ROGAN: I think it's going to like, show me that they fucking found it.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I don't. I don't know if they did, but they.

JOE ROGAN: I don't know if they did either, but it's like it's interesting. But it's not as interesting because you're saying, show me the Ark of the Covenant. Right. So he's drawing what we all saw in Indiana Jones, or can you locate it? What year was that? That was before Indiana Jones. No, it had been in the same time period. When did Indiana Jones come out? What a great movie.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: The 90s, right?

JOE ROGAN: I don't know.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I'm thinking and like, the first two are the best.

JOE ROGAN: Raiders of the Lost Ark was the first one. That's the one. What year was that?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: 1981.

JOE ROGAN: Okay, so precursor. So that's seven years earlier. Everybody saw that movie 100 times. You know what it looks like. You know what the Ark looks like. So if I tell you, go draw me the Ark, where's it at?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: You think?

JOE ROGAN: All we have is some scribbles on paper. Unless they actually went there and found it.

Examining the Mission Details


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, what's interesting and I should probably ask Radcliffe, like Radcliffe, can you tell me this? I never look at an Ark of the Covenant.

JOE ROGAN: What are you saying, Jamie? It says the mission is to access and describe the target identified by coordinate. And then there's coordinates. The tasking is to see mission statement training. Target is the Ark of the Covenant. So they did say, go find us the Ark of the Covenant. And then this dude apparently set keep AOL to a minimum. What is that? I don't know. I saw that on the paper earlier. Have to be careful with editing, though. This does not seem to be a problem at this time. Just something to watch for attained. Excellent sight contact.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Okay, definitely interesting.

JOE ROGAN: Well, it's weird that they're talking about it like it's a real talent, like someone can actually do it. Mosque domes. Yeah. Target is in a container. This container is in another container. Has another container inside of it. The target is fashioned of wood, gold and silver. The target is similar in shape to aol. So that's that something of location, right? Is that what it means? Area of location. Area of location. Yeah, that's it.

Coffin and is decorated with the Seraphim Sea sketch. This target is located somewhere in the Middle east, as the language spoken by individuals present seem to be Arabic. Well, wouldn't you want someone who could fucking decipher Arabic to do this?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We don't know how far it went, and I definitely have questions, but this would not be the first time that a government would have looked for something. Especially because people theorized that the Ark of the Covenant had these abilities as a super weapon.

The Ark of the Covenant and Remote Viewing


JOE ROGAN: I know, but I'm saying the remote viewer is limited by his ability to understand the language. Stop, stop. Scroll back up, please. So somewhere in the Middle East, visuals of surrounding buildings indicated that the area. The presence of mosque domes. Individuals in the area were clothed in virtually all white, had black hair and dark eyes. One figure I honed it on wore a mustache. The target is hidden underground. Dark and wet were all aspects of the location of the target.

See, the only problem I ever have with these things is if these places are all controlled by terrorists and zealots, you know, dictators and crazy people over there. If they found out that the Ark was there, they would fucking take it.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I think there's this aspect of, if you look at it from a biblical perspective, no one would be able to access it anyways because it would be protected. Right? That's what the Bible says.

JOE ROGAN: Cannot be opened until the time is deemed correct. Oh, Jesus. Once the time to open the container, the mechanisms of lock systems will be found to be fairly simple. Individuals opening the container by prying or striking are destroyed by the container's protectors.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, what's interesting is, remember in the Bible it always talks about how there had to be…

JOE ROGAN: Through the use of a power unknown to us.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They had to, you know, go through this special process of being considered, you know, holy basically to access it. So all that to say that there's something out there. Right. I think that obviously God's real and this job has definitely, you know, put me in a position to where we're able to help get other truths out there, if you will.

JOE ROGAN: You need to get the truth of that thing out there. They need to find that. How much would change if you found the actual Ark of the Covenant? And you could explain a lot of things. Look, if these Ethiopians have it, which Graham Hancock believes allegedly they do. Yeah, Graham Hancock believes that they do. And he said that these guardians, they all get cataracts, they die of radiation poisoning.

Ethiopian Orthodox Perspectives


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I mean, there's something to be said about the Ethiopian people as a whole. And going back to the Ethiopian Orthodox text, actually when I first launched this task force, I actually went and I met with an Ethiopian Orthodox pastor, if you will, just to kind of see and explain and ask questions that I can't exactly go to, you know, the Smithsonian and ask.

And, you know, his response was interesting, especially from their perspective. You know, you have a lot of this aspect of, I think, religion that tries to be doom and gloom. And then in the Ethiopian perspective, he's like, “First of all, your timeline's wrong.” And I'm like, “What do you mean your timeline?” He's like, “Well, the biblical text in modern day Christianity, it's a little bit off. Right. So we use a completely separate. I think it's 364 days out of the year” and he's explaining all of it and he's like, “But even then. So, you know, we don't have the perspective of, you know, we are in the end of days, et cetera. But, you know, the way his perspective just seemed very optimistic as opposed to pessimistic and filtering and controlling information, all that stuff.”

JOE ROGAN: He's probably not online.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: He's off X. He's off X.

JOE ROGAN: He's off X. He's off TikTok.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah. He's not subjecting himself to the New York Post.

JOE ROGAN: The thing about that says that the viewer was identified with a target and didn't know what it was being. The Ark of the Covenant. After all the explanation they found. Oh, well, that's much different. Yeah. So that whole thing at the end of it was what they were saying it was when they wrote it in that report. It's just a bunch of words they're putting together and got it. Hearing how they put off talk about it. Well, that's way more interesting. If he didn't know what he was looking for and he found something that looked like the Ark of the Covenant. That's pretty crazy.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They kind of talk them on, right? They'll give them something and say “walk us through.”

Human Consciousness and Spirituality


JOE ROGAN: I'm just doing devil's advocate because I have no skin in the game. I don't know if it's real or not real. I'm open to it. I think there's something going on. I think there's more going on with people than we let on. There's some extra thing that's happening with human beings, the way we're all connected to each other that we don't really totally understand. And I think the idea that you can access information that's not local, I don't think that's that weird. I think that might be an emerging aspect of human consciousness or an aspect of human consciousness that's atrophied.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Or just an aspect of spirituality that we've previously forgotten because we're in such a digital age that kind of programs you into the rat race. And I think people, the more that they're kind of, you know, there has to be more to life than just a 9 to 5 and, you know, working for this aspect of materialism. Don't get me wrong, I like, you know, a nice car and a clean house and all that. But, you know, there's also this aspect of, you know, being a human.

And if you have kids, I think that's one of the things. I have, you have a daughter, I have a son. And it's when you're a parent, it kind of makes you realize, wow, there's this aspect of love that I didn't know existed before. And you can kind of really be there and help, you know, grow this next human and influence that person. And it just kind of, the human experience is something that, you know, you can make it as special as you want.

And this aspect of, you know, us being able to have those little quantum breadcrumbs is what I call them. Have you ever been talking about something and you'll go somewhere, hear something, and there's confirmation of what you've been talking about, or, you know, something happens and you're asking a question, then all of a sudden it pops up kind of. There's the answer. And I think that those little things, just when you're on the right path and doing what you're supposed to do in this bigger picture.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, well, it's a good way to live life if you believe that. It's healthy, smart. It's a good strategy. I wonder why some people seem to have the idea of it being an emerging aspect of human consciousness. Our ability to sense things and know things that are going to happen, or premonition or know if someone's a liar or a weirdo instantly. I always wonder if, is it that or is it that we used to have that, before language, that's all we had.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I think that before tech really evolved, there was a bigger aspect of spirituality that actually talks about that. So discernment in the Bible, you can talk about, you know, this aspect of being. People say, “Oh, if someone has really bad energy,” you picking up on it, there's something to that. But I think that because, and it's really happened, I think, in the last 40 years, where people are kind of forgetting that.

But when you actually go back to, for example, we're talking just now about the Ark of the Covenant, the Ethiopian Orthodox text and all this, there's more of that aspect of spirituality that I think has been removed from society. I think it's actually taken away our ability to really respect one another and value human life. And I think that from a political perspective influences decision. You get really pro war people. Those people are usually not that spiritual, and they really don't have a value for life in that aspect.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, no, that's definitely a real thing. That's unfortunate that there's a, and the fact that those are the type of people that always want to be in power.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They are. They're the worst type.

JOE ROGAN: That's probably the scariest part of it.

Congressional Work and International Relations


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I actually had a really groundbreaking conversation. So the way I'll describe Congress is because you ever have a job where 80% of it, 90% of it's just really eating shit, and then the 10% is really cool. And it makes up for that 80, 90% that you're just…

JOE ROGAN: That's when I hosted Fear Factor.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Okay, so that's it. Yeah. That aspect of, I think, really exists in politics, if you actually care. And I had a meeting recently where I was with two other members of Congress that were helping me with the JFK investigation. And we actually met for the first time since 1990 with the Ambassador to the Russian government.

And I bring that up because at the time of the JFK assassination, the KGB had actually come forward with their own independent investigation, and they actually gave it at Kennedy's funeral to U.S. officials. We never got those documents. And it's my belief that the CIA actually destroyed that information and evidence because it would have confirmed what the KGB. And mind you, at the time, JFK was actually in talks with the president of Russia at that time.

And his perspective is that he actually wanted to do joint mission between the US Government and the Russian government to the moon. And there are aspects and divisions within the intelligence community. You obviously saw the Cold War was happening. They wanted war in Cuba, they wanted war with Russia. So for them to be able to say that Kennedy, who was not a Communist, but that he was a Communist sympathizer, and “how dare he talk to these dirty communists.” I mean, that in itself would have given them any ammunition to turn a blind eye, or at least not fully figure out who assassinated Kennedy.

But I bring that up to say that, you know, when you have these people in power, you know, you can see a lot of it in regards to their. There's a summit on the 15th, actually, with President Trump and Vladimir Putin. And I think the aspect of, you know, anytime you have peace and trade, it's way better than war for everyone involved, for the people of Ukraine, for Russia, for the American people, and I think for the surrounding regions.

I recently got back from meeting with government officials in Romania and Moldova and it didn't matter if. And I actually met an actual member of the Moldovan government who is a communist, an outward communist. And it didn't matter who I talked to. Everyone wanted peace. And then when we had met with the European Parliament and the EU, some of them wanted peace. But then the countries that had the shittiest economies, excuse my language, they were the ones that were advocating for war. Well, you have a war based economy, it always helps your economy. So if you have terrible policy perspectives, obviously you would advocate for something like that.

But it just goes to show that the people that are going through it, the people that are living it, that are directly impacted by it, no one would advocate for war. And so in even just having this conversation, you know, a lot of people, even, you know, two administrations ago, maybe two administrations ago, probably would not have had that conversation. But to be able to develop that dialogue.

The end result of that meeting was the Russian government agreed to release their investigation onto JFK that the previous congressional task force in the 90s had tried to obtain from the Russian government. And they said no. So they agreed to release that and they'll be posting it publicly for the American people to go through later on this fall.

JOE ROGAN: Have you seen it yet?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I haven't, so I'll be seeing it at the same time everyone else does.

JOE ROGAN: What do you think is in there, if you had a guess?

The Russian Government's Assessment of Oswald


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So when I was talking to the ambassador, he's actually a history buff too. And so he had actually said that the Russian government, when Oswald was actually in Russia, had done a psychological profile because they thought, you know, they're like, “Is this guy part of American intelligence? Like, what's his story?” And they thought he was basically nuts.

And apparently he tried to go hunting when he was out there and they were observing him and he couldn't shoot for shit. So they're like, you know, “He didn't meet our psychological profile.” Then he shows up to the Russian embassy in Mexico City with a gun and they're like, “What the hell is that? Like crazy guys showing up at them like, what's going on?”

The Joannidis File Revelation


And then we find out simultaneously as this is all happening, that the CIA, kudos to Director Radcliffe, had actually released something called the Joannidis file. And George Joannidis was actually… He's basically our version of James Bond, but more corrupt. And he was basically observing Oswald. He had lied to Congress. This was all in his file. He was then the CIA liaison to Congress during the investigations, stonewalled their investigations, was later awarded something from the CIA.

So we have the CIA admitting that they lied to Congress, covered up the assassination or covered up the investigations. We had admissions from the Warren Commission, people that had been subject to the Warren Commission's investigation saying that the Warren Commission engaged in witness intimidation. They omitted evidence. The single bullet theory never exists. The CIA administration that Lee Harvey Oswald was not a lone gunman. People ask, “Well, you know, does this mean that you'll ever get the name of who killed him?” No, because I don't think the CIA was like “kill JFK on this day and use this gun and have this person assigned.” But there was evidence of multiple shooters for sure.

JOE ROGAN: Well, there had to be multiple shooters. There's injuries like one of them was the front of his neck.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We had testimony to that.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And actually what's interesting is when we first launched the task force, we had left leaning news outlets that were trying to write hit pieces saying that I was basically launching a conspiracy theory task force and they had to print the truth weeks ago. You can actually pull up.

The Psychology of Conspiracy Denial


JOE ROGAN: What is it about people that don't want to believe that some conspiracies are real? Is it a comfort thing? Is it you think you're going to erode trust in the government? Is it you just have such a rigid worldview and in your mind that there's always been Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. That's what happened. And because of that, anything that challenges your belief system you fight against.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, specifically to JFK. For decades the intelligence agencies were influencing what the print and press was doing 100%.

JOE ROGAN: If you're Geraldo Rivera, you know, when Dick Gregory brought that film on the Geraldo Rivera show and you got to see the Zapruder film and you got to see what looks like a shot that makes his head go back and to the left.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: And the which would indicate he got shot from the front. I think he got shot multiple times by multiple shooters from multiple different directions. And I don't think necessarily Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't in on it. Well, here's the problem. People say, “Oh, Lee Harvey Oswald couldn't shoot.” You don't have to be that good with a rifle to be you're on a ledge so you have a secure rest if your rifle sighted in and they said his scope was off, but that doesn't mean shit because you could just drop your scope and it's off. Like all you have to do is take your rifle off of that ledge, drop it on the ground and now that scope is off. You never drop your gun like that. You can knock your scope off.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, there's multiple problems, though, because the Warren Commission actually never even put into the report. Right. So, like, if you're…

JOE ROGAN: But let me finish.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Let me finish.

The Magic Bullet Theory


JOE ROGAN: My point is that wasn't a far shot. It was like, what was it, 140 yards from the Book Depository with a scope and a rifle with a rest. No, you could kill a guy like that. And he could have been the shooter. He could have been one of the shooters. But I think there's too much witness testimony. There's too much evidence. There's too… The whole idea of the magic bullet theory was just because they had to account for all the wounds in the bodies with just three bullets.

And they found a guy who got hit in the overpass. In the underpass, rather. He got hit with a ricochet. Yeah. So now they knew that bullet couldn't have hit Kennedy or Connally. So how do you attribute all these wounds to two different guys? From multiple gunshots to a single bullet.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's a magic bullet.

JOE ROGAN: Don't you know, you have to find this bullet that fucking for sure didn't hit any bones. And there's more fragments in Connolly's wrist than they were missing from the bullet. The bullet looks almost pristine. It looks like they shot it through, like, feathers or they shot it into water, which is what they do when they do ballistics tests on rifles.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, what's interesting is, is the Warren Commission did omit multiple female witnesses who were actually at the Book Depository that day that actually stated that they had never witnessed Oswald actually in the location or going down the back of the Book Depository. So that's…

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, it's possible that he could have snuck past them. There was a lot of chaos. You hear gunshots, the President shot. People don't always think straight when things are going nutty. People have a terrible memory. Right. After traumatic events.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: Like, yes and no. Like, he might have been there or he might not have been there. He might have shot at Kennedy or he might not have shot at any. But for sure, he was some sort of government operative.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: For sure.

JOE ROGAN: He was traveling back and forth from Russia. He married a Russian citizen. There was a lot of weird stuff.

Government Gaslighting and Public Trust


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: He was under surveillance by the CIA, so there's a lot there. However, I will say this. What the official narrative was, we now know is BS, right?

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. And that I thought from the beginning.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, but a lot of the American people did. But to have their own government say “No that's not true.” To gaslight them and to push this narrative of “If you question it, you're wrong, you're crazy.” That in itself, I think, when you're talking about, like, why do the American people not trust their government? It's really this fracture that starts around the Kennedy era and timeframe. And you can see then that distrust kind of evolves.

But why do you… Going back to your original question, why do people refuse to kind of question conspiracy theory? Maybe there's some substance to it. And I think it's because it's more comfortable for people from a psychological perspective to live in this comfort area, that their government might not do something like that or might not try to cover up something like that, because that's just an easy way of life.

JOE ROGAN: But look, it's too scary.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's too scary. But the fact is, is that, look, I've traveled a lot, I've dealt with a lot world leaders. We are still the greatest country in the world. Make no excuse about that. But it doesn't mean that we can't call out and hold our own government and officials accountable. And so that's kind of what I've guessed. My mission has been this Congress and what I hope that it will continue to be.

But I'm not trying to do this for, like, even the next 10 years. So for someone like me, you know, people are like, “Oh, initially, you're going to ruin your political career talking about this. This is crazy. Why would you even want to do that?” And then, you know, they're seeing all these big wins coming out in regards to transparency. And I will say, had it not been for the secretaries that have been appointed by this administration, this wouldn't have happened. Because under President Biden, he actually also tried to declassify things pertaining to JFK, and the National Archives never released it. And so in addition to…

The Importance of Transparency


JOE ROGAN: That's not a good sign. None of that stuff's a good sign. Like, if you want trust from the American people, people, you release information. If you want us to distrust you, you hide everything, and you're hiding everything on one of the most important events in human history.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They were up until recently, and we're still documents that the JFK community, because, mind you, I'm actually working with… His name's Jefferson Morley. He is not a Republican. He's a Bernie Sanders Democrat. But on this issue, we're working great together. And he's actually been helping me. And he's like, “Look, I've been waiting for this stuff for like 30 years.”

JOE ROGAN: This is a hugely bipartisan.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, it's super bipartisan.

JOE ROGAN: This is something we can all get together. That and UFOs. It's the one thing Democrats and Republicans both completely agree on. Like, tell us what's up. Tell us what's up. Who killed them and are they real? Those are two giant questions that we all have.

The Mysterious CD-ROM Discovery


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I think they're real. The other part is still outstanding, but hopefully when the documents are released from the Russian government later on this fall, that might be able to provide a full picture. Granted, I'm going to take it with a grain of salt because it's still, you know, it was written by the KGB. But at the end of the day, we have a good mosaic that's been put together with at least the documents that have been released with this administration and for any outstanding documents, actually have a team assigned to me from the CIA that is actually helping me chase down these documents.

And I've already had some interesting experiences. Like, not creepy, but, for example, after President Trump signed the executive order, and Radcliffe has been super helpful, we actually were made aware of this. Allegedly there had been a document that was at the CIA that was a report from the Inspector General that had implicated the CIA, allegedly, in the assassination of JFK. So I'm following up on this lead and trying to find the… this report. And the archives is like, “We don't have any documentation of this.” The CIA says they don't have any documentation, and they've been good with us so far.

So I go to the archives because they're like, “We found this weird bag, though, and it's in this SCIF, and it's been here for five years, and it was left by our former attorney for the archives, and so we don't know what's in it.” And I was like, “Well, go open it.” They're like, “Well, we don't have the key, and it's in a vault.” And I said, “Well, I'm coming over.” So I drive over, literally, like, put my son in the car. I get in the car, and I go over to the National Archives. We go into the SCIF. I pull up this bag, and I'm like, “Does anyone have scissors?” And we, like, cut open this little folder, and there was a CD ROM in it.

And this has, again, been declassified now, so I can talk about it. But there was this CD ROM of a ton of wires from the State Department. Some of the wires were pertaining to the Kennedy family, and it was actually a WikiLeaks document. And so I think the reason why it was kept at the archives is because you're not actually supposed to have these documents on government computers. WikiLeaks obviously don't happen with that. But here I was like cutting it out of a bag at the National Archive.

JOE ROGAN: That makes sense that you would have the most top secret documents burned on CD ROMs. That way no one could ever get access to it by hacking into your computer.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: To this day, I don't know. Even who left the CD ROM, I don't know. And there's some other stuff in that that I don't need to get into.

JOE ROGAN: But why don't you need to get into it?

RFK Assassination Connections


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I won't get in trouble. But the stuff that was on there was interesting. And I think I saw recently Tulsi had actually talked about some of the State Department wire that had been found that… And I think these are the same ones that had talked about the assassination of RFK. There were wires going up from the State Department prior to his assassination, which is interesting. So our next investigation. So we've done multiple case…

JOE ROGAN: What do you mean by that? Like how did they specifically discuss it?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, that's… I haven't seen the actual wires themselves yet. But what that would imply is that the State Department knew about the assassination before it took place.

JOE ROGAN: Oh geez.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And that was something she talked about.

JOE ROGAN: Did you get into the MK Ultra stuff at all with Jolly West?

MK Ultra and Operation Paperclip Connections


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And I look at that on my free time, but that's not the purview of the task force. But there is stuff that you can. Again, CIA.gov reading room super creepy. I did find a document on the archives website that actually ties the initial phases of the MK Ultra program to Operation Paperclip.

JOE ROGAN: Oh boy.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Interesting.

JOE ROGAN: That makes sense, right?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And it's there. And I'm reading this to my husband.

JOE ROGAN: Because for sure the Nazis were experimenting on drugs with people.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They were doing a lot of bad stuff.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, they were doing a lot of horrible stuff. But for sure they were experimenting on their soldiers and on prisoners and they're experimenting on all kinds of people.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Creepy stuff.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. And if we took some of that and applied it, the Jack Ruby connection to it is that Jolly West went to visit Jack Ruby after he shot Lee Harvey Oswald. And Jack Ruby was pretty rational before then. And then after Jolly West leaves, he's freaking out, seeing things that aren't there. I think he said something about Jews burning. He could see Jews burning alive. Like a psychosis state full on lost it. Most likely got dosed with acid. Most likely Jolly West just hit him with a shot glass of acid.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: That's a terrible way to go.

JOE ROGAN: It doesn't. He went so far off the deep end. Then he died later. I think he died a few years later of cancer. But I think he completely lost his mind after Jolly West visited him. And Jolly West was involved with the Manson family thing. He was involved with Operation Midnight Climax, where they had brothels. The CIA was running brothels. And they would get these johns to come in with the prostitutes, and the prostitutes would give them acid. And they didn't know it.

And so they were sitting there and there was two way mirrors, and they were filming them. Why these guys? Well, for blackmail, for observation. They knew these people were never going to say, “Hey, you did that to me. Look what the government did. Dosed me up with acid.” Because they're not going to admit they went to a brothel. So you have the perfect group of people to victimize and just try stuff on.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, and they got in trouble for it, too. The CIA had to do payouts. They were getting sued for it. And then when all this did flush out, I mean, it's always economically.

JOE ROGAN: Well, the Freedom of Information Act was the only. And then they found a bunch of documents. They found documents that were. I forget who found. I forget Tom O'Neill, who wrote the book “Chaos,” goes into great detail about this. It's all about the Manson family and MK Ultra. It's a fantastic book.

The Stigma Around Conspiracy Theories


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, even just this conversation right now, there's such a stigma that exists around it because it's such a spooky topic.

JOE ROGAN: And so you don't want to look stupid.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: You don't want to look stupid. And so look, anyone watching this can go look at this information, go to CIA.gov reading room and know it's not going to be a phishing website that's going to steal your information. But you can find for sure it is. Where are we accessing? But it's always been one of those things. And if people ask me, I'm just very transparent about it.

And I will say something that started out with a stigma of being this conspiracy theory investigation, wasting taxpayer dollars, has been arguably one of the coolest task forces in Congress, I think, and we have a lot of good people that are behind it.

JOE ROGAN: And I think the tide is turning on that kind of thinking, that these conspiracy theories are silly to pursue. Some of them, yeah, some of them are silly, but that doesn't mean that some are true. Also, there's a time honored tactic of taking. Look, if I was an intelligence community, and I'm not accusing anybody of doing this, but if I was an intelligence community and I had some truth that was very inconvenient to a narrative, and I wanted to label that truth as being a preposterous conspiracy theory, I'd add a bunch of kooky stuff to it.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Or have disinformation campaigns or dole it.

JOE ROGAN: Out to the nuttiest people on the Internet. Dole it out to the craziest people. This guy's got a drinking problem. He's got a conspiracy theory website.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Or take a little and spin it to him. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: Get it to him and tell him you're helping him out. You're going to give him some insider. Get him to spread a bunch of kooky stuff so that when that stuff gets disproven, the other thing's attached to it so the other thing looks stupid, too. That's what I would do.

SCIF Flu and Reluctant Witnesses


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah. We've had our fill. The one thing I wanted to do when I first got the task force is open up a SCIF to any person who held a clearance to come brief us on what they knew about UAPs. And I can tell you that we've now had.

JOE ROGAN: What was the first conversation like, when the door shuts and you're like, “Oh, boy, I'm…”

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, the problem. The problem is I've reached out to some of the biggest names in UFO lore, okay? And they all got SCIF flu. And we call it SCIF flu. Meaning, the day that the SCIF was open, that we reserved it, we're here. Come on, come brief us. They get sick or they didn't recover and come back. They didn't recover, and then they just don't talk to us anymore. So ghost you. They ghost us. Yeah. So I'm like, well, if you're not going to talk, tell me to SCIF. Then you're full of crap.

JOE ROGAN: Or you're scared for your life because you're just a scientist. Who doesn't. Maybe they got threatened. Maybe someone let them know that maybe someone hung something on their door in the middle of the night.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But if people say they're going to go tell us in a SCIF and then they don't show up, it's a problem. Right? So they've already gone public.

JOE ROGAN: But maybe those people don't feel like the government's going to protect them.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: That is one of the biggest things that we've had people bring up is that you're a whistleblower, but whistleblower protections only go so far and you can't do anything for my physical safety. And some of them do allege that there's these actual physical. We actually had someone that we wanted to bring in to testify because our next hearing on UAP is going to be, I believe it's next month.

And the individual that was actually told to us by David Grusch is actually a former combat controller. And so my husband, Air Force special operator, combat control. So we knew the guy via some friends. So we knew that the guy wasn't nuts or crazy and reached out to him and he did not want to come in. He wanted nothing to do with. It was like, “I am not touching this.” And so stuff like that happens.

JOE ROGAN: Well, also, you put those folks on TV, right?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, we don't have to. We can do private. But if we testify.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, if it comes time where they have to testify and there's a lot of time in between people finding out this guy came and told you guys what's up to testify.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Don't freak out our witnesses, Joe.

JOE ROGAN: But that's the problem. This is why what I was talking about is what's being advocated in the documentary that to me makes perfect sense is mass analysis, amnesty. Now, here's the bad part for sure. You're dealing with enormous sums of money and I'm sure people got really rich off of that. And I'm sure it's super illegal if it's real.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: What the back engineering potential.

Private Contractors and Competitive Advantages


JOE ROGAN: Yeah. I mean, and also the competitive advantage you would give company A. If this company gets access to a downed craft that can traverse space and time, that can move through the universe instantaneously, that utilizes an unknown element that has some unknown process of defying gravity. It's utilizing no interior mechanisms of control. Everything is done with the mind of the pilot. This is the truth. If this is what they're saying.

And these are the kind of things they find that getting to a contractor would be a massive advantage over the other contractor that also should be on equal standing with the government. Right. They both make jets, they both make whatever it is. So it's like, what do you do? Do you divvy up your spaceships in between these folks? Are they the only ones who get to know it? And then how do private contractors, how are they the gatekeepers of the most important information in the world if it's true?

The Eglin Air Force Base Incident


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, so. And that brings us to what happened at Eglin Air Force Base. So, in a nutshell, we had been told by. So Representative Gates had come forward and said that he had two or three pilots had to contact him, saying that the Air Force was covering up information regarding to UAP activity in the handle, and he wanted us to go with him to invest.

So we show up at Eglin Air Force Base. We're met by the base commander. Previous to us even showing up on this congressional delegation to investigate, the Pentagon had tried to cancel the meeting. And you can't. So this was under the last administration, so you can't just cancel a meeting and say you can't come to the base. That doesn't work.

So Gates actually was on House Armed Services at the time that oversees the U.S. military. And so Gates got the chairman involved, calls back onto the Pentagon, gets this meeting on the books. And we told them specifically, we want to see information on UAPs. We want to see the evidence, and we want to have the pilots that saw these aircraft, whatever they are, or these spacecraft, we want to have briefings from them.

In a nutshell, we get to Eglin Air Force base, they keep BSing us about the Chinese spy balloon. That's not what we were there to see. And ultimately, we were in the SCIF. We got into a verbal disagreement with the base commander at the time who was denying us access to the pilots and to the information, and said that we didn't have the authorization in the SCIF. There was many members of the intelligence community.

We then go back upstairs to the conference room and proceed to, again, basically have it out with this commander. And Representative Burchett said, “We could do this the easy way or the hard way. You choose.” A movie kind of. But it was at the time.

JOE ROGAN: I like it when people use a movie.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, easy way, the hard way. And if it's the hard way, you're going to have Representative Gates and Luna in D.C. questioning you. So I suggest you do it the easy way. So he actually, in the middle of the meeting, we know we were kind of holding his feet to the fire on it. He got nervous as we were talking to him, and he, I kid you not, he goes, “You know, they're going to like that. I'm not going to let you see it.”

So he was thinking out loud, but didn't realize that he was basically saying it. And then in the middle of our meeting, he gets up and leaves the room like, “I have to go to the restroom” or something. And then maybe five minutes later, this tech sergeant comes in and says, “Oh, the base commander's been authorized to go and leave to Georgia. He won't be coming back.”

And I'm sitting there looking at Gates and Burchett, and I'm like, “He just left in the middle of a congressional delegation. That's never happened.”

JOE ROGAN: Said out loud, “They would be happy that I'm not telling you.”

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah. Verbally articulated it. Gates was there. My husband was there. Burchett was there.

JOE ROGAN: Is this. That guy's. He's in a powerless situation. Right. If he does give you access, he's.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Going to get in trouble.

JOE ROGAN: He's in. He might be really in trouble.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But here's the problem. He can't. Who. Even if it was someone at the. Like the Secretary of Defense. Right. Because at the time, this got pretty high level.

JOE ROGAN: I'm not saying it's not illegal.

Congressional Delegation Incident


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah. He still. At the end of the day, you're in the military. How our government functions is the military does not decide what the civilian sector and what representatives can and cannot see. It's not supposed to function like that. So he got up and left.

I've never seen this happen. I was in the military. I've never seen, in the middle of a congressional delegation. These are big deals. You just get up and go and leave to Georgia and you just don't come back. In the middle of the meeting. It never happened.

JOE ROGAN: What state were you at the time?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We were in Florida. He just gets up. He's like, drove to Georgia. What the hell are you doing? You're going to the middle of a congressional delegation going fishing. And then his second in command comes in and they managed to get one pilot to come down and brief us.

And what I will tell you is, I will say it. Representative Gates has gone on record. He actually did as soon as he left office. That we've seen stuff that I don't believe was created by mankind.

JOE ROGAN: So you can't tell us what you saw, but I'm going to let you infer.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Infer.

JOE ROGAN: See, this is the problem that I have with all this stuff.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I should be able to tell you without losing my clearance.

JOE ROGAN: Well, not just that. The people that have that information should give that information to the general public.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Correct.

JOE ROGAN: And stop treating us like you're smarter than us and that you can handle it and we can't. That's silly.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Which is why we have to declassify.

The Hal Puthoff Study on UFO Disclosure


JOE ROGAN: Which is why you know the Hal Puthoff stuff. Hal Puthoff during the Bush administration was assigned. He was one of many scientists, and this is also in the age of disclosure. He was one of many scientists that was assigned to put a numerical value to pros and cons of UFO disclosure.

So they said to him, “We have a crashed UFO that we have been back engineering and we want to release information to society to let people know that UFOs are real and that there is something else out there that's not us. It's much more intelligent than we are.”

So they have this list of pros and cons, banking, religion, societal structure, everything on one side. And then the pros like whatever the positive aspects of it would be. And every single scientist said that the cons outweighed the pros.

And he said, “I would have loved to have had disclosure, but this was just what they asked me to do. They asked me to compile numbers and to do it in a way that's super objective.” And he said if I'm doing my job, this is where I think it would completely wreck our government, completely wreck any idea that the people that are in charge of us have any position of authority when there's something that can go 100 million times faster than we think is physically possible through the universe, appear out of nowhere, stop all of our nuclear programs, shut down bases, do weird shit.

Society's Spiritual Evolution and UFO Theories


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But don't you think that that's where it's been interesting because society has moved away from this aspect of having a spiritual grounding and even believing in most people today think when you talk about praying even that whole concept, it's kind of just poo pooed.

But if you have a grounding in that, and going back to what I was saying earlier, I think that that's not. I don't think that society would do that. Granted I'm not a scientist, I'm not running numbers, but just based on how we've kind of been evolving with access to information and the questions, the discussions that have been happening, not just here, but I think internationally.

I just think a lot's changing now to say that we were, and I've heard some wild theories like people think that humanity was seeded by UFOs. And I don't agree with that theory. I'm going to address it.

JOE ROGAN: It's a fun one.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's an interesting theory.

JOE ROGAN: If you found out it was true, would you tell everybody?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I mean, I'd be transparent about it, but I just don't personally believe.

JOE ROGAN: If you found out that was the information that the government had?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I'd put it out there because that's what.

JOE ROGAN: Right, but what would that do for your belief system?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Would it suck?

JOE ROGAN: But would it suck really? Maybe that's what's confusing about the Bible. Maybe what's confusing is that it was an oral tradition for hundreds, if not a thousand years before it was ever written down.

Biblical Texts and Oral Traditions


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I think that it depends on what book you're talking about.

JOE ROGAN: So like the Old Testament, if you go back to the oldest works of the Bible, weren't most of those stories handed down generation after generation and then eventually written down, written into texts?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, some of them are written by prophets and then. But I mean, Enoch is apparently supposed to predate even the time of Genesis.

JOE ROGAN: Well, the nuttiest one is Ezekiel.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I'm telling you, Enoch is even crazier than Ezekiel.

JOE ROGAN: Did you find anything about whether or not Enoch is controversial?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: You can look up the 4th century.

JOE ROGAN: It was excluded as well, I guess since the fifth century, it wasn't in canon.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Fifth century.

JOE ROGAN: And why did it get excluded? It says the Jewish scribes or the priests didn't believe, the rabbis didn't believe it was canon. So it's considered, it's regarded as scripture.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But what's interesting is, is that even if that's the case, though, you have the Ethiopian Orthodox Church that actually there's Ethiopian Jews and that's considered the most pure form of the Bible. So you actually have a division of the Ethiopian Jewish class that actually recognized Enoch.

JOE ROGAN: How weird is it that some rabbis 500 years ago made a call?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But that's what I'm saying is you can't discredit.

JOE ROGAN: It's kind of weird, but you can't.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Discredit it because again, when you have people removing books, I just, I think, look, and I'm not telling people what to believe. I'm just saying you should take a look at it.

The Exclusion of the Book of Enoch


JOE ROGAN: Oh, here it is. “The main reason for the Jewish rejection of the book is that it's inconsistent with the teachings of the Torah from the standpoint of Rabbinic Judaism. The book is considered to be heretical. Another reason for the exclusion of the text might be the textual nature of several early sections of the book that make use of material from the Torah. For example, Enoch is midrash of Deuteronomy 33.

The context. Particularly detailed descriptions of fallen angels would also be reason for rejection from the Hebrew canon at this period, as is illustrated by the comments of Trypho the Jew when debating Justin Martyr on this subject. ‘The utterances of God are holy, but your expositions are mere contrivances, as is plain from what has been explained by you. Nay, even blasphemy infamous for you assert that angels sinned and revolted from God.'”

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So it was a.

JOE ROGAN: It seems like some people made a decision that something shouldn't be in there.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, but that's the thing is it's a disagreement in religion and perspective, but they should have still not removed it. And so it's interesting because then you have the evolution of what the King James Bible is. We all know that story. He wanted to get remarried, they rewrote it.

But you even have the Catholic Bible that has. It's what happened, right? You have the Catholic Bible that had books that were taken out, and then we have the King James. So I'm not saying that if you read the King James, you're not getting. You don't have access to God. That's not what I'm saying. But I am saying that there's a bigger picture here that we need to discuss.

The Impact of Human Editorial Decisions


JOE ROGAN: Well, there's always a problem when people get involved and when people get involved in making decisions that this could be real and this could not be. The problem is all these years later, you're dealing with the repercussions of that.

Imagine a world in which if Enoch was left in the Bible and people were like, “Wait, what happened?” Explain the nuttiness of the book of Enoch to people.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Okay, so if you read it, it talks about the fall of angels, thus creating really the precursor of civilization that led to the first flood. I think that when you even go into potentially the technology that was given to mankind by these angels, it talks about the hidden beliefs and theories in astronomy, metal workings, all of it.

But it really does explain, you were talking about earlier how you have a lot of these religions around the world that kind of say the same thing. This is kind of the OG text that leads to those stories that we're hearing from many religions around the world to talk about angels mixing with mankind and then seeding a super essentially race of humans that essentially were responsible for basically damning mankind to the flood.

I mean, you hear about stuff in Greek and Roman mythology, people who had these super crazy powers, and you talk about it out loud and it sounds crazy, but that's what the book says. And then the fact that it was taken out and then it's poo pooed. Yet you have one of the oldest religions in the world, via the Ethiopians, that actually still have it. You have the Catholic Church that has books that are missing out of the King James Version.

I'm just saying that when you read it, you should read it and decide for yourself. Don't listen to what I'm saying. Don't listen to what you're saying, but truly give it a chance and see what you have to say. And then you're going back to this whole concept of if you have this information pertaining to UAPs, whatever they might be, the origins, I mean, if you have an understanding of what Enoch was talking about, kind of makes sense.

The Challenge of Ancient Translations


JOE ROGAN: Well, I go back to my thoughts on all this stuff. It's like very few people could even read back then. Very few people could write. So you're not going to write. You're probably going to try to capture a truth. You're probably not writing necessarily to deceive people and make up a story.

So the question is, with all this stuff is what was the original truth that they were trying to write down? And how much of it is getting distorted by translations from ancient Hebrew to Latin to Greek to Aramaic? How much of it?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And there's a thing.

JOE ROGAN: And is it possible to even understand what they're saying without understanding the language? My friend Rick Strassman, he's a very fascinating guy, but brilliant guy. One of the things that he did is he taught himself ancient Hebrew so he could read the Bible in Ancient Hebrew. It took him 16 years.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Wow.

JOE ROGAN: But he did it because, “I want to know it in that language.”

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I mean, that's smart, because there's always an aspect of translation where you lose certain implications.

JOE ROGAN: If you're playing the telephone game, you want to be second, you don't want to be fifth.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Exactly.

JOE ROGAN: And whoever was writing it down the earliest. That's probably. You're closer to their depictions of what that truth is. Then after King James starts fucking around with it and all these other things.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Want a new wife, got to remove her Instagram?

JOE ROGAN: People start getting involved. But boy, when you go to the really old stuff, the really old stuff is very strange.

The Ethiopian Orthodox Bible


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: The Orthodox, I'm telling you, the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible, I actually had a staffer that went to Ethiopia, she was on a church trip and she actually brought me back a copy and she's like, “You can translate it via Google translation.” So kudos to modern day technology.

So I have it in my office and actually when I did my swearing in, I actually did my swearing in on the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible.

JOE ROGAN: Wow.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's direct translation.

Religious Implications of UFO Disclosure


JOE ROGAN: That's kind of crazy. You know, I would wonder what the impact to all these religions would be if we had definitive proof that we're not alone. Like if there was an introduction, like some sort of an event where they decided, “Look, this government is too secretive with all this information. You're holding back the understanding of these intelligent life forms that they are not the apex of this planet, nor are they anywhere close to the peak of the intelligence that's available out there in the universe. Just let me show you real quick.”

And then what does everybody do now? Like what happens to the Mormons? Everybody's going to blow a gasket.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I think that brings us back to… So by the way, I'm by no means saying that aliens are God. That's not what I'm saying.

JOE ROGAN: No.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But I think that brings us back to the fundamental question: do you believe that God exists? Because if you do, then you realize that our freedom, the freedom of choice, is not a man given right, but a God given right. And I think that goes back to the fundamental principles of what we believe in true representation.

So if you believe that God is real, God is powerful, then it shouldn't be a king or a man that you're looking to, but to God for divine inspiration and to make your life decisions. That's ultimately what freedom of choice is.

JOE ROGAN: But I think even the Catholic Church has acknowledged the idea that if there is intelligent life somewhere else, it doesn't mean that God didn't create it.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, that's true.

JOE ROGAN: Maybe God just didn't tell you about the neighbors.

Ancient Texts and Hidden Knowledge


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, it does say in Enoch, and then also in Genesis that “the stars cried out.” And so if you're looking, well, a star, if it's not… what do they mean by stars crying out? And then Enoch actually alludes to stars in certain capacities being potentially angels.

Now I'm not saying… and this is kind of interesting because, you know, I've had this aspect of my task force, what we've been investigating, but then I have my personal beliefs and my religious beliefs. And what I'm telling you is that in my position officially, I've seen men pervert information to get what they want.

So it's not unlikely that an entire, very secret, very truthful text was omitted in an effort to control population and to insert yourself between individual's relationship between them directly and God. And I think that, especially…

JOE ROGAN: If it doesn't agree with your interpretation of God. And this is the issue with these rabbis, right?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I mean, if you're having people determine any information. Yes. You should not be able to do that.

JOE ROGAN: Just the same thing as the UFO stuff.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: The UFO stuff.

JOE ROGAN: No one should be the gatekeeper of information.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Exactly. And hence the transparency on the information.

JOE ROGAN: Especially something that should be for all of us. This is nuts.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I think we're probably going to be responsible for the Book of Enoch sales probably increasing on Amazon.

JOE ROGAN: Well, I'm going to buy it. I'm going to buy it. I need to read it now.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: You'll trip out.

Ancient Civilizations and Lost Knowledge


JOE ROGAN: Well, I wish I could. I mean, I'm sure there's some interpretations of the Dead Sea Scrolls that I could sludge through. But the thing about it is, I'd really love to be able to read it in Aramaic. I really wish I could read Aramaic. I just don't have the time to do that.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: You should see if there's an audible source.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, I'm sure there is, but what I'm saying is I really like the Strassman idea of learning ancient Hebrew to be able to read the source material. That's where it gets really interesting. Because what were these people trying to write about?

And if these people like Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson are correct and these folks that believe in the younger Dryas impact theory, the Bible was written a couple thousand years ago. These people that are talking about the younger Dryas impact theory are talking about a cataclysmic event that wiped out advanced civilization 11,800 years ago.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, Plato talks about it, hearing it from Egyptian teachers and then going back to the Atlantean civilization.

JOE ROGAN: Right, but what was my point is what was their Bible? You know what I mean? Like, if you can get back to 11,800 years ago and read what they thought went down. Because I think that's probably where the oral traditions come from.

The oral traditions come from complete collapse of society, rebuild over time takes forever. And then a re-understanding of what you know to be true about the origin of man and the birth of the universe and why we're here. And then you got to figure out what Jesus is.

The Anunnaki Connection


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, so I actually… When I was in my early 20s, I actually went to Egypt to see the megalithic structures there. And then I went to Turkey to see the Sumerian inscriptions and carvings and what they thought the ancient Sumerian gods were, the Anunnaki, all that.

What's interesting is in Enoch, it actually has reference to the Anunnaki, but a different… I think it's like Anu is the root term that's used for it.

JOE ROGAN: Have you read the Zechariah Sitchin stuff?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: No.

JOE ROGAN: Do you know of it?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I have heard of it. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. That's the most fun.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah. Well, I will say with all of that going back to… If you read Enoch and then follow about the fall of mankind and the angels… and this is Christian theology, right. So angels came down, rebelled against God, and bred with humankind, that would be, I think, a good starting point for what potentially the Anunnaki were.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, God probably didn't like that they were coming around and taking the ancient hominids and juicing them up. Juicing them up, make them smarter.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Heaven did not approve.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, it's probably against the code of the universe. God probably says, “Look, you can go visit, but don't mess around with it.”

Divine Justice and Government Accountability


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, there's definitely something to be said. It actually talks about this in Enoch, about a divine justice. And so I think, going back to what is our job? How would society function? You have aspects in government. Do you trust your government? Is government going to follow through and bring accountability?

That's our job in the same sense, in that we have to ensure that if we are to truly have an equal and fair society, that you have to have this aspect of justice that has to be carried out. And I can go back to something that I found kind of crazy, but the mandatory minimums for child predators are not that high in this country.

And so Congress can actually increase the mandatory minimums, but there's been a lot of lethargy about that. And it's like, why would you not want to increase it? Some people are against the death penalty. And I always say that it's not my job to play God or to judge people, just to help to arrange the meeting.

Historical Investigations and Government Transparency


JOE ROGAN: Yeah. It's a weird job, right? I mean, you're involved in the disclosure of things that have questioned, that people have questioned forever. I mean, these are… Those are the huge questions that exist from the 1960s on: UFOs, JFK, Martin Luther King, RFK, those are the big ones.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We're looking for it and there's a good group of people that are signing up into it. I did say recently… So the MLK documents just came out and we're wrapping up our JFK investigation. So after we finalize the JFK investigation, we're putting out an official congressional report on our findings and people can read it and decide for themselves. Then we have RFK and then MLK.

But I think a lot of the MLK family was actually very concerned that we were going to go into extracurricular. And that's not the objective of the task force. It's to specifically expose what the government was doing if they knew about the potential threats.

And people say, “Well, why do we care about…” I constantly get, “Well, we shouldn't care about this.” No, you should, because there has to be a check and balance. And when, if the CIA was operating outside the purview of the federal government, if you know that whistleblowers are being punished, if they need to be reformed to the FOIA act, all of this stuff, then we have to be able to put forward legislation to ensure it doesn't happen again.

And what's been very interesting and almost serendipitous about the whole JFK investigation is you have President Trump now in the second term that's released all this information and multiple people, presidents tried to, but they were worked against by their own secretaries within these agencies, and then deep state actors that tried to block the efforts for release.

Now you're seeing kind of a flush of the system. And even though information hasn't come out as fast as we would like it to, the fact that they've made these admissions is really good. But moving forward into how do you prevent this from happening again?

It's people really do… young people, especially because there's so much fatigue for people that have been in office for… And the reason I say that, I don't even want to do this for the next 10 years is because everyone, even people I've looked up to, after a certain amount of time, they lose their edge. And I think that's because you're up there, you're taking in a lot of incoming. It's not a fun job, you're getting attacked, you're getting beat down. It's stressful.

But if you can put all your energy in it now and then you can cut ties and pass it on, that's how our founding fathers wanted us to do: pass the torch, stand up the next generation.

Term Limits and Congressional Reform


JOE ROGAN: Right. But we have a bunch of career politicians that want to stay in office for 50, 60 years.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Correct. And that's the problem. And it's on both sides.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, it's on both sides.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So I'm trying to do a discharge petition now on term limits. So back in January of my first term, so back in January of 2022, I'm sure you saw there was this massive speakers fight about confirming Kevin McCarthy as the speaker of the House. And I was part of one of those 20 that said, “We're not going to vote for you just yet. We need to reform the institution and the way that we function,” because power had been consolidated within the Speaker's position.

So much so that how it's supposed to work is you're supposed to be able to bring a bill forward, that bill's supposed to come to the floor. All these policies were being consolidated in one person. And if you didn't fall in line, you wouldn't get committee assignments, you wouldn't be able to fundraise. They would basically cut off all aspects of fundraising in Washington.

And the mainstream media for a while was like, “You guys are disrupting the process. You guys are fighting.” Well, what the hell do you want Congress to do? You want us to just fall in line and not argue our principles? Last time I checked, you're supposed to fight for that. And so we were able to reform the institution.

But one of the things that we had negotiated with the former speaker was we wanted a vote on term limits, and that never came up. And so now, because of our very slim majority, one of the slimmest majorities in US history, we have the ability to do something called a discharge petition, and it's where you can physically go down and basically collect signatures on a bill.

And so I'm bringing forward two that have already been filed. One is going to be to force a vote on term limits. So I'm going to see if members of Congress will actually put their name to actually bring that bill to the floor. There's going to be a massive, I hope, pressure campaign to activate members to do that. And then the other one is banning insider trading.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, that's been talked about for a while.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But hasn't been done. And we can do it now.

JOE ROGAN: She just needs a little more money and then she'll quit.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, it's not… there was a communications director meeting for the entire GOP and I'm calling up bringing a bill on banning insider trading. And we were not invited to that meeting. Our staff was excommunicated from that.

JOE ROGAN: I wonder why.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, I know some people are making money.

Congressional Stock Trading Corruption


JOE ROGAN: Shocker. It's crazy how openly corrupt that part of the business is. But the thing is, once you've become accustomed to be able to do something and you've been able to do it for decades, you're very reluctant to give that up. Why would you give that up? That's a huge advantage.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: People say that it doesn't exist, but last time I checked, when you are given access to CEOs, when you're given access to information that are affecting markets and then you're on the committee that has purview over those bills, you do have information.

JOE ROGAN: Like, for example, it seems like you have a little more than the average person.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And there's a lot. You can look at people's portfolios. They go in making $175,000 a year, and then all of a sudden you come out, you're worth like $20 million, $200 million. It's kind of shady.

JOE ROGAN: You're not really gambling. The stock market is kind of gambling. You're not gambling. The UFC doesn't even allow me to gamble and I can't even affect the outcome.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So you can't do it, but Congress can.

JOE ROGAN: For now, at least the inside information that I have, anybody could have. Mostly not really. No. That's not true. No. I know some stuff sometimes, unfortunately.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah. I was told if I forced a vote that I was going to “cost us the Republic” is what I was told.

JOE ROGAN: But the thing about the insider trading thing is the amount of money is so egregious. Like, isn't Pelosi now worth $400 million? Wasn't that the…

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Upwards. I saw upwards of $200 million. But I thought, compounding interest, I thought…

JOE ROGAN: She jacked up her portfolio recently. Significantly, significantly.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But it's not just her, it's on both sides.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, yeah, no, she's just the poster lady. Unfortunately. No slight at her. It's all across the board. If you look at how many people… It's red, blue, red, blue. It's the whole thing. Everybody's doing it.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I told my husband, I was like, “We're not going to do stocks because it's just…” That's the one thing you can talk to anyone. I actually was reading an article and the local press are like, “Rep. Luna is trying to force a vote on this.” Right. And so I'm always the kind of red headed stepchild usually with especially in dumb circles.

But this one lady posted, I actually started laughing. She goes “Well a broken clock is right twice a day.” And I started laughing because I'm like it's such a bipartisan issue, like over 80% of Americans don't think that Congress should be able to trade stock. And it's true because we're given access to information and that's truly influencing your decision.

JOE ROGAN: Did you ask her what the rest of you are wrong about?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I mean I tend to, I think it's just, I think it's party associations like some people just will never vote.

JOE ROGAN: A broken clock.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah.

Political Polarization and Bot Activity


JOE ROGAN: People are rabid and they're super upset now obviously because Trump's in office again. So that rabid nature has been over amplified.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It has. I think a lot of it though is driven by bot activity I think is really big. I can tell you that when I first launched the task force people were like “She's an intelligence asset, she's never going to release information” that it came out that I actually don't have declassification authority. But we have been able to produce and we are getting full cooperation from the executive branch. So we're just simply investigating the findings, collecting the information and pressuring for release.

JOE ROGAN: There's real people along with those bots, but real people are also influenced by bots as well.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Group things.

JOE ROGAN: There's waves of negativity and positivity that go in certain directions that are orchestrated and there's companies that are known companies that you can actually hire them to go do stuff.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They exist in Florida actually. There's a couple of social media influencers that have been approached. I've seen it so I know it exists.

JOE ROGAN: Crazy.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: What's interesting though is it goes back to that you never want to get in trouble in a crowd of people because they'll just look at each other. You ever see someone getting beat up and they just film it, right? Going to help that person and that's part of that group. Think it exists online?

I do think X needs to do something at least be able to label bot accounts because I've seen it happen, especially on certain things like I had done something to allow new moms to vote. When you're recovering, our job is different. Only 13 women in US history have ever given birth. It's about to be 14 who are members of Congress and God forbid we enter a war or something. We're not going to be able to vote if you're recovering in a hospital. That's a pretty rare circumstance.

And so there was definitely bot accounts that were attacking me for that and accusing me of destroying the Republic. Again, I said I don't think that's the case.

JOE ROGAN: But yeah, that's not tinfoil hat stuff, folks. You really need to know that. Why wouldn't there be? This is the thing. If you were… Whether it's this country, a corporation, another country, why wouldn't you automate your system or have AI or even just have actual people that have a job and their job is to type inflammatory, whatever it is, insults, whatever it is. Whatever their accomplishment, whatever their goal they're trying to accomplish is. Why wouldn't you have a group of people that you have at your command if it's legal? Because it is legal.

Social Media Manipulation and Censorship


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It is legal. And in politics. What's interesting is the test, especially when you're running for office. It's kind of interesting because you'll actually… During my first race, I actually had a firm that I was going to for consulting and they had someone that had worked at the firm that had also worked with McDonald's branding. So people that are running for office will bring on these terms and then they'll give them kind of a branding profile.

What was interesting about that is that you have this aspect of bot activity. Social media at the time was kind of just resurfacing as if you want to be kind of influential, you have to be able to use social media, share your message and get that out there. And I think Trump really kind of refined that was kind of one of the leading figures in that, especially when Twitter 1.0 was in existence.

But then you had this aspect of people that were running for office and then there was actually a censorship state in this country. And we found that out that Twitter 1.0 was coordinating with the Department of Homeland Security. We found this out actually in a congressional hearing where they were actually… And DHS had a division under that was supposed to be monitoring terrorist organizations and they were using it on the American people to censor information. Specifically on COVID on January 6th. All that. That is scary.

You still have censorship issues in places like the EU so to think that they wouldn't use social media platforms especially to influence the masses is just… That's not a conspiracy theory. That happens. We have evidence of that.

JOE ROGAN: Of course censorship is influencing. It's also causing people to self censor, which changes discourse.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah. Not wanting to have conversations with each other.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. Well, you can get banned from Twitter for a variety of things, particularly during COVID but I think was also a great test case for them. Let's see, if there is some sort of catastrophe, some natural disaster, some national security issue where we could now enforce new regulations of censorship.

Chinese Government Influence Operations


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, and scary regulations at that. Because COVID was really kind of dystopian and going back to kind of, I think you'd mentioned foreign government influence using bots. The one thing that's been interesting is in our investigation so taking now my task force hat off and going into actually problems that we see right now happening.

You saw this massive a couple weeks ago rift that was taking place between the American people specifically on immigration. And all of a sudden these pop up riots. I actually called them the Temu riots, like the Temu Chinese act, because it came out via actually this woman, her name's Data Republican on X. And she actually tracked down the funding line.

And what was happening was the Chinese government was basically propping up this billionaire, American billionaire Neville Singham. And actually he was donating money to organizations like Party Socialism and Liberation. And they were actually funding a lot of these riot pop ups in the area.

So you had people that were being used divided, for example, on the immigration topic, you literally have them passing out, Mexican flags saying that they cared about immigrants, when in actuality the financial ties is actually coming from the CCP. So the Chinese government on many occasions, and it's not uncommon within Congress to know, even on apps like TikTok, they were showing certain information in order to cause a rift and influence people.

This same individual, Neville Singham, actually once we got this information, we sent a request to have him come testify to Congress and he spends part of his year in Shanghai, China. And so we were not able to deliver him his subpoena basically. And so there's a letter that Chairman Comer has now offered, authorized to be sent that will go to the Treasury Department to freeze his assets unless he comes to testify to Congress.

JOE ROGAN: Wow.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And that, mind you, this is not… People and look, I started out before politics with my feet getting wet as an activist. That's actually how we started out in politics. So I understand the immigration, the border, I understand all arguments because I've been through it and I've had a debate on debate it.

But what's a problem for me is that you have foreign governments trying to cause a rift and then promote ideologies that will empower people specifically to push forward policy that will actually put us as second tier as opposed to the Chinese government. And I do think that the Chinese government in their execution has been very, very specific about how they want to hinder our ability to be global dominators.

I think when you're looking at what happened in COVID time frame, right? So people said that Wuhan lab leak, that that was a conspiracy theory. We now know that it happened, and that was true. But at the same time, if you look at what President Trump was doing, he was actually trying to negotiate trade with China and he was winning. And then all of a sudden COVID happened.

Well, what was interesting second time around in Trump 2.0 is that you have all these Temu riots taking place at the same time. And it almost got no coverage in the mainstream media, but you had multiple Chinese nationals that were caught trying to release agro terrorism weapons.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, we talked about that stuff.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, agro terrorism weapons. And then at the same time the tariff war was taking place and then you actually saw them trying to infiltrate. So I don't think it's by accident, but I do think that it's important to remember that just because you see something happening on the mainstream media, the media will always try to amplify something because it's rage baiting and it's click and it's views which translates to money.

JOE ROGAN: And if it's negative against Trump, it gets front page views.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Of course, of course. But when you actually look at where the funding stream is coming from, it actually goes back to China. And this is not the only incident where they try to drive a wedge back between Americans and then actually compartmentalized with Hispanic Americans specifically.

So in 2016, now the largest voting minority in the country are Hispanic Americans specifically of Mexican descent. And I think you can find that stat on PewHispanic.org so when you're looking at voting demographics, how could you influence an entire demographic to help skew or influence a midterm election? And it would be specifically probably on the immigration topic to try to race bait people.

But then you have this aspect of the same guy, Neville Singham, his wife actually funds an organization called Code Pink. So this is all Chinese money now going to a separate cause. And this one specifically is on the Israel versus Palestine issue. They don't care about Israelis or Palestinians. This is a Chinese funded group. And what they are doing is they're using that front in an effort to then divide on that topic as well. So it's a multifaceted approach using minority classes in order to actually push the end goal, which would be communism.

JOE ROGAN: Wow.

Corporate Exploitation of Illegal Immigration


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And also too you can actually look on the flyers for these organizations. So PSL Neville Seedingham is actually an open admirer of Mao Zedong. I mean like it's all up there and it's out there for you to find. But it's just crazy because most people, you know, you see this aspect of propaganda that's being shown to you and you're not going to be like, “Who's funding that?” You know, you're going to be able to say like, you know, tell with that person, “I'm going to fight for this.” But they don't actually realize the more nefarious perspective of what's happening behind the scenes.

JOE ROGAN: So I absolutely believe this is true that I'm sure other countries fund similar things. But also it was in reaction to some of the ICE raids, right? I mean it was a visceral reaction that a lot of people had the idea of people just showing up and pulling people out of schools and pulling people out of Home Depot and pulling people that were just hard working people that maybe snuck over here because they didn't have a legal way to get over here.

But since they've been here they've been good people and they're a part of communities and that's what freaks people out. Because what people, when people thought about ICE, they thought “Great, we're going to get rid of the gang members.” They didn't think, “Great, you're going to get rid of a landscaper.”

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But the question is why didn't they do it then during why did these riots and why did this happen under.

JOE ROGAN: No, no, no, I don't disagree with you. I think Obama, Biden, listen, I'm sure some of these riots absolutely are manufactured. I'm sure they are. I'm sure these pallets of bricks that get left off on corners when they know that there's going to be a BLM riot, that's bananas.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, they fundraise. But to your point, so how do you fix something like the immigration system as a whole, right?

JOE ROGAN: You definitely don't have an open border. That's crazy because you need to know if people are criminals that are coming in. You don't want cartel members coming in, you don't want murderers coming in and serial killers. Like there's a reason why we have borders. All the above, right? There's a reason why we have borders but the thing that freaks people out is like, how many corporations rely on illegal labor.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Tyson Foods is one of them. Yeah, we actually, last year I was putting out some messaging on them because I'd watched this documentary about the slaughterhouse and how they're actually using migrant children like 14, 15 in some of these slaughterhouses.

And the lobbyist from Tyson Chicken Corporation contacted my chief of staff at the time and was trying to basically say, “Hey, basically back off.” But I don't care, it's wrong. I don't care where you're on the spectrum. You shouldn't allow migrant labor with children specifically because child slave labor.

JOE ROGAN: I'll tell you a story that a high level government official told me.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Okay.

JOE ROGAN: I don't want to, I don't know if he said it on here or not, so I don't want to say his name.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Wait, so he was on here. So then that narrows it up. Okay. It's okay.

JOE ROGAN: Someone actually said to him that they don't want to stop the illegal immigration because they need cheap labor.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Correct. I actually think that it'll never stop, at least not in college.

JOE ROGAN: That they don't have to pay them any benefits. They don't have to take care of.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Their insurance or pay them at all.

JOE ROGAN: Well, they pay them, but they don't have to pay them what they're supposed to pay them.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I've heard cases where people, specifically contractors, will walk on people if they know that they're here illegally. And so going back to how do you fix this?

Immigration System Reform


JOE ROGAN: Right.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Is one of the top cases that I handle, aside from Social Security help and refunds, within my congressional office. So a congressional office does constituent services and it's basically like customer service. “Have you been victimized by the federal government? You know, call this number.” That's your congressional office.

So specifically on immigration cases, if you've had an issue with the State Department visas, all that you can contact your local congressman. And so what I will say is that we've had people that have spent tens of thousands of dollars to come here, but it takes 20 something years to do. And that's part of the problem is there's been such an influx and such a bog down of the actual system that our actual system is not functioning at the capacity that it should to actually help people come here the correct way.

JOE ROGAN: Well, especially poor people. Right. And if you want to immigrate to the United States, the application, one of the things they ask you, “Are you an expert in something where people in the United States can't do it?”

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Like a doctor, or maybe you're a.

JOE ROGAN: Musician and no one else could sing your songs, maybe you could get citizenship from that. But if you're just a landscaper, you're just a guy who lives in a third world country and you want a better life. And you say, “I heard you can get across. And I heard when you get across, you can get work.” What is that guy going to do? That guy doesn't have the money to hire a lawyer. He's not going to. How is he going to prove that he's more valuable than a United States citizen that's already here doing the exact same job?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I do think that unless we are able to assign probably more lawyers, more judges to actually hear these cases, it's going to continue to be a problem. And I have heard, okay, on the floor, these are conversations between members that to a certain extent, especially when you're talking about an E-Verify system within the ag industry that actually members of that committee don't want that because they know that the farmers are actually heavily relying on some of these illegals to work in the building.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. And construction crews and fill in the blank.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So I can confirm that.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. So isn't the solution force people to pay everybody exactly the same way?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, yeah, because you don't have the decrease in wages. However, I think the bigger problem that we have here though is that at least specifically in my district and then also to having argued this, is that this gray area that's been created, in my opinion, they don't want a solution for they do it intentionally with the understanding that both sides are going to fundraise off of it.

In my opinion, if I was to be able to actually fix this, I would say that you have to. I would say pause, let the system run through, take everyone in, vet them, make sure that they're not criminals, et cetera. But then the system allows time for it to actually catch up to itself and then you can continue as is.

Political Fundraising and Nonprofit Corruption


JOE ROGAN: What you just said was so scary that they don't want to resolve it because they want the issue to exist so they could fundraise for it against it. That's so nuts and probably so accurate. That's probably so accurate because anytime anything ever happens, one of the first things they do is “Please donate,” throw it up. All the people that are very reactionary, “I can't believe this is happening.”

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And you know what's crazy is most elected officials might send out that email, but the email fundraisers actually are taking 80% of that dollar. That's usually the average retro. And it's like, I'm in the wrong business. This is crazy.

JOE ROGAN: The scariest thing about nonprofits is how much profit they make. It's really weird when you see the salaries of some of these people that are nonprofits.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I will never. I will never.

JOE ROGAN: A year. You're like, what is. How is that?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And they do nothing. That's crazy.

JOE ROGAN: Or what's going on with the LA fire thing? You know, where they can't figure out where all the money went. And it went to 188 different nonprofits.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Who is it? Spencer is his name Spencer Pratt? I was like, Spencer Pratt for governor.

JOE ROGAN: He's a little pit bull. That dude's on that thing. His house got burnt down.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And then they promised. All these celebrities are like, “Yeah, donate, we'll give it to the victims.” It's like, where did it go? There's this fine print that he wrote.

JOE ROGAN: It's really weird, but it exposes the legality of these systems. It's legal for them to operate like that. Where, you know, an enormous percentage of all the money that comes in goes to overhead. It goes to.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And they did find.

JOE ROGAN: But it's such a scam. It's such a weird scam and it's such a devious thing because you're pulling.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: On people's heartstrings, which is why, going back to what I said, we need younger people and we need more normal people to run for office.

AI and Military Technology


JOE ROGAN: We need AI to take over.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I don't know about.

JOE ROGAN: AI is our God.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So no, no, no, no.

JOE ROGAN: AI is our governor. AI is our king. That's what we'll say in school now. AI is our king.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We need to. I think AI can be used in good senses. And I ask Grok things a lot and I will argue points, but I think we need to work alongside it because there's this aspect of AI that removes the humanity. I don't think you can teach AI empathy. And there's a certain aspect of humanity that needs to be kept involved in these decision making processes.

For example, if you have a drone that's been targeted to, let's say, eliminate a terrorist at this grid location and it's functioning solely on AI, well, what's going to enable it to be able to pause on destruction of a location if there's children within it? I mean, if it's a bot it's not thinking.

JOE ROGAN: That's true. But the US history of drone use is no better than what you just described.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, there are oversights and massive investigations, especially if it's in regards to civilian casualties.

JOE ROGAN: Right, but civilian casualties are the majority of deaths from drones.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I would say based on the people that I've talked with and interacted. It's definitely happened in the past and it's definitely problematic. However, I think it's.

JOE ROGAN: People get in trouble for it's. But it's the majority.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I'd have to. I mean, look, I don't.

JOE ROGAN: The majority of the people that died were civilians. They weren't the intended targets.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, and that's a problem. And that's where a lot of these people do. You have low act. So there's massive investigations with the JAGs, et cetera, that get involved in these investigations.

JOE ROGAN: I'm saying, would AI be better than that? I don't know.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I think you can have. I think you can have an AI decision making process, but where there is a human involved in that step. Process. So the human would be the final step in authority. So the AI would rank it maybe. And granted, I'm not an AI programmer, but I am saying that I think that there's an interface where you can have humans involved in the final.

JOE ROGAN: Well, the most terrifying solution is not. That is don't use the missiles. Instead you have a chance drone that specifically targets one person.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, there's suicide drones. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: But I mean even worse, flies through the house and lands on the dude's head and blows up.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Don't freak me out too much because the Chinese have a little spy drone that's literally this big. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: And they just have bug drones, mosquitoes. I'm sure our government does too. There's no way the Chinese are the only ones who do it. Especially if they really have been back engineering UFOs for the last 40, 50 years.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I don't think that any other government is as advanced in regards to that topic as we potentially are. And I say that because if that were the case, then they would be the world superpower.

JOE ROGAN: I agree with that. But I also think that even though we probably have the best military contractors, we also get infiltrated by the Chinese government and the Russian government all the time.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, that's.

JOE ROGAN: They're always.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And Congress gets infiltrated?

JOE ROGAN: Yes.

Chinese Infiltration and Technology Concerns


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: How many people have all of a sudden hot Chinese girlfriends? No comment on that.

JOE ROGAN: Guys are weak. We're so weak. All you have to do is be hot and we're stupid. We fall.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: He's my biggest fan, that guy.

JOE ROGAN: Of course, there's always going to be people like that that infiltrate universities, that infiltrate research centers. They get information back to the CCP. There's that famous story I think Mark Andreessen told us about how was it in Berkeley? I forget what the corporation was, but the power went down. And so all these CCP people panicked because they were supposed to send the information back. And if they don't, hey, maybe your grandmother doesn't get her medicine. Maybe your family gets a visit. You have to be on time.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: The University of Michigan has now had two. I think those agroterrorism was University of Michigan.

JOE ROGAN: It's all over the country they've been infiltrated by these governments have very cleverly inserted their ideology into these universities. Yuri Bezmenov talked about this, that Russia was doing this in the 1980s. It was 1984.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: The one thing that's been interesting is, and a lot of people aren't talking about, there's one representative member Republican from California that's addressing it, but when they have surrogates, have children here for US Citizenship, but then they take them back and fully integrate them and educate them in China. And so technically they're US Citizens, but they are being totally raised with the ideology and perspective of the Chinese government. And that's an interesting perspective.

JOE ROGAN: And then they come back over here and they're full US Citizens.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yep.

JOE ROGAN: Working for the Chinese government.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yes. Access to all of our resources, everything. Education system.

JOE ROGAN: And then we sell the Chinese government land around our military bases.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, that has been. I love our libertarian brothers and sisters, but I have gone into so many debates on this because they're like, “Well, we shouldn't limit an American's ability to actually sell their property.” And I'm like, “Yeah, but the Chinese government literally wants to eliminate the west as we know it.” And so we have to be cognizant of that.

And also, it's not just buying a military installation. You think that they're not actually putting tech and observing, monitoring, pulling all of our resources? Not just that.

JOE ROGAN: Mike Baker talked about this on the podcast that they sell cell phone towers, Huawei to these companies. Well, Huawei, which they were really problematic, but they sell these cell phone towers near these bases. And so they sell them at a discount. And then the Huawei stuff was crazy because it actually had third party access built into some of their systems.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And a lot of the tech that they actually sell here, whether it's to our law enforcement. So anytime you have specifically, I would say, within even our craning and our actual shipping operations, those things are sending signals back home.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah, well, we're so stupid we can't make those things.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, we should be making. So there's policy chambers where if you have an American business, you can now actually get a big tax incentive for manufacturing back home.

JOE ROGAN: That's great, but it's going to take 10 years for us to even catch up to where they are now.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We just got to stay the course.

JOE ROGAN: What a dumb idea. Everyone has a cell phone. No one can make a phone. What is that? No one saw that coming. That's bananas. All of them get made in China.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It came out in the 70s for manufacturing. And I think that's where you're seeing this aspect of people that are very – if you talk about – and I'm not an isolationist by any means, but I do believe that we should have, especially with COVID everyone saw this. We should have certain things that are just manufactured here. I think tech is extremely important. I think Palmer Luckey's doing laptops or something now in the United States or trying to actually move that over.

Tech Monopolies and AI Competition


JOE ROGAN: Elon should make a phone. I bet he's thinking about it because he's in some sort of a dispute right now with Apple because Apple won't – there's something about the way Grok AI shows up and he's saying that their algorithm is essentially rigged. Where OpenAI is – Grok AI is never featured.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, really? I have something about an app on my phone, but.

JOE ROGAN: So maybe that'll incentivize him to make a phone.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Elon, make a phone and we'll try it out.

JOE ROGAN: “Elon Musk says Apple is rigging the app store for ChatGPT. The tech mogul is threatening immediate legal action, accusing the iPhone maker of unequivocal antitrust violation designed to favor his AI rival.”

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, is his AI rival Sam Altman?

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. That's interesting. I wonder if that – I mean, you don't just say something like that, do you?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: No, no. He definitely – he's not a dummy. He's smart. There's definitely something.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, readers added context “2025 Deep Seek reached number one.” And Deep Seek's the Chinese one, right?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, and Deep Seek's freaky about some of the stuff that it can do.

JOE ROGAN: “Just one month ago, Perplexity also reached number one overall in India's App Store. Both of these occurred after the OpenAI Apple partnership announced on June 10, 2024.” But what about the United States? Because the United States is the biggest market when it comes to – we're probably the highest percentage of people that use Apple in the world.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's literally when you go to buy a phone, it's usually an iPhone.

JOE ROGAN: I think it's something crazy with kids. It's 84% or something like that.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, don't get me – if you have a kid, keep them off phones as long as you can.

JOE ROGAN: Yes, for sure. But the point is, the App Store in America, that is the monopoly in this country if you want to get an app. I mean, it's not a monopoly, but the leader, the head leader.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: To be honest with you, I've only ever had an iPhone and so that's the only platform I've ever used. I know, it's Android versus iPhone.

JOE ROGAN: No, I have both. They're both really good. Android's way better than it used to be.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But it's still freaky.

JOE ROGAN: I had it back in the day, but it's right there where an iPhone is right now, just different. And gives you a lot more access to stuff.

Privacy Concerns and Secure Phones


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, it's so freaky though. Then you have these phones that are considered actual safe phones that aren't ripping your data and basically turning on every 10 minutes to kind of be able to target you for sales, whatever it might be. I can tell you that given my job and some of this stuff, I am totally freaked out by having an iPhone. And I look forward to the day where I don't have to have a phone. I'm going to get a flip phone.

JOE ROGAN: They're going to already have a chip in your head by then.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: No, absolutely. Me of all people, no chips. We're chip free.

JOE ROGAN: I don't know if there are any phones that really, truly are safe. I mean, I know that there are some phones that run on alternative operating systems that aren't Google. What is that alternative system that they use with Pixel phones that now, at least the French government, when they find people that have Google phones, they immediately look at that person as a point of interest.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: That's because they're like, “We can't track you.”

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. Because they're using this other operating system. What is it called again? I can't remember. But it's what Adam Curry uses. It's a de-Googled iPhone that uses an alternative operating system. So this doesn't send data. I'm sure the GPS sucks. It's probably called graphene. That's right, Graphene OS.

So there's multiple different OSes that people use outside of the Google, but you can only use it on Android phones and a lot of people use it on Pixel phones. You can actually buy them. What is that guy's name? The Asian gentleman who has that? Rob Braxton. He sells them and he is a security advocate. He's always talking to you about how insecure all of your technology is and explaining why they added this and what this means now and where your data is going and how they can track you.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's made me.

JOE ROGAN: So he sells de-Googled iPhones. Oh, he's a response to Joe Rogan. “Joe Rogan is wondering what I'm hiding. Five years ago I was just saying what's – he's scared.” So this guy's been at this forever, right? So five years ago we were talking about him and he was making these phones five years ago.

FISA and Government Surveillance


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, and from a government perspective, you have this aspect of – a lot of people don't want to reform FISA. FISA in the way that it can surveillance Americans is pretty freaky. We would like.

JOE ROGAN: Really freaky.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Really freaky. And I actually did not get a committee assignment on House Armed Services as a vet because I voted against FISA and I was one of two that voted against it. And they said that I was not a team player. But when you actually look at.

JOE ROGAN: Playing for the team seems to be an ongoing thing.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I am playing for the team, but it's just not the nutty team.

JOE ROGAN: Isn't that a nutty thing to say? Whatever happened to representative of the people? What are we doing?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: There's still a few good representatives. I believe it's few to part between.

JOE ROGAN: Well, I think it's hard. It's probably hard to stay course. It's probably hard to keep your morals and your ethics when everyone around you isn't.

Political Integrity and Pressure


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: You have to not. So some of the best representatives, best even people in government are the ones that did not have to do this job.

JOE ROGAN: Right.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And that's because if you're giving up something to come here, it means that you're doing it for the right reasons. If you have nothing to gain from this position and this is the only thing you've ever wanted to be, you're usually not the best person for that job.

And I say that because you are then only going to do what it takes to get reelected, which means that you are willing to compromise your principles because there will be decisions that you have to take where you're going to have to stand firm on your principles and be like, “I can't vote for that.”

And there's massive pressure campaigns. When a certain bill comes up, if I'm voting against it, you have planted stories in the press. You have super PACs that will come in and drop text messages in your district to your constituents saying, “Did you know that Representative so and so voted against this?” And so you have to be able to be like, “All right, I'm just going to just disconnect.” And at a certain point, you do have to do that, because then you'll go crazy.

JOE ROGAN: You'll definitely go crazy if you read all the bots.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, you can't read. Don't fight with the bots. Don't fight with the bots.

JOE ROGAN: No, people do read them. It's just interesting that representatives today, some of them are kind of characters, where they become.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's Gotham.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. Where they become popular. Fetterman is popular.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: He's changed that. He actually makes sense on stage.

JOE ROGAN: Much more reasonable than most. Yeah, he's a logical guy. He's a very nice guy. I think it's hilarious that he still wears the hoodie and the shorts. He's exploiting a rule.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: He is in the Senate kind of right.

JOE ROGAN: He's kind of right. And that is really how he likes to dress. When I saw him in DC, it was 10 degrees out. This dude had shorts on and a hoodie, a Carhartt hoodie. And he's just – but that's genuinely him. I think he's a good guy.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, he's a big guy, too. So there's only his.

JOE ROGAN: Probably sweats a lot. Probably easily warm, likes to wear.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Not saying that we know he sweats, but just, for sure he does.

Political Characters and Bipartisan Cooperation


JOE ROGAN: He's a big guy. But yeah, no, he's reasonable. But the point is, he's kind of a character. Like Jasmine Crockett's a character. AOC. A character. There's characters and they're like main characters in this political show that we're all watching on television.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oversight. So I actually was on oversight with all these people, except for Fetterman. And what I'll tell you is the oversight tends to bring out the characters, for sure.

And what I will say is that actually I have been able to on certain things. Like with AOC, I introduced a piece of legislation. So there was a partner bill in the Senate with Bernie Sanders and I think Josh Holland to cap credit card interest at 10%. And then we started getting. I started getting a lot of heat for it because people were like, “you can't do that.” And I was like, “well, most of these banks that we're talking about are actually taking government bailouts. So if you're taking a government bailout and you're essentially operating off the goodwill of the federal government, then you should be held as standard, because then you have predatory lending.”

And what ends up happening is some of these people will take out credit or max out their credit cards in them for the rest of their life. They're paying back the debt. And then also there's something that we've been able to introduce. So this is like the more populous representation where you see both the right and the left kind of agree on certain things. And there's another bill that I'm introducing with another Democrat and another Republican that's a more moderate Republican, but it's actually to cap student loan interest at 2.5%.

The Student Debt Crisis


JOE ROGAN: That would be wonderful, because I was just going to ask you about that. I was reading this woman on X and she was talking about how she graduated with student loans that equaled, I think it was $28,000. She's paid off. She's never missed a payment, paid off $24,000, and she still owes $60,000.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah. So what they do is they actually, and I've been quoted on this, but it creates an indentured servant. Basically, for the rest of their life, they're paying off this debt. And you can never actually function in a pocket.

JOE ROGAN: Right. That's absolutely insane. If she's telling the truth, and I believe she is, that's absolutely insane. That you could owe $60,000 plus after a $28,000 loan when you've paid $24,000 of it off.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: For people that are actually trying to better themselves, that might have to take out loans for that, it's crippling. And then they actually can't get a good start at being contributing members of society.

JOE ROGAN: Exactly, exactly. If you want to make America great again, have less people in debt, have less losers.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Opportunity.

JOE ROGAN: Opportunity, yeah. Have more people that can get things going on because they're not burdened by some crazy debt. That really is not right. It's not right that you do that to an 18 year old kid, saddle them down like that for the rest of their life.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And to be clear, I'm not talking about student loan forgiveness. I think you're not either. But I had to join the military, I paid for my college using the GI Bill and so do I think student loans forgiveness is fair? No. But is this a way that we can actually make a happy medium to where people are actually given the opportunity to pay back the debt? And yes, and so I look forward to introducing that. But that's a piece of legislation that should be on the floor and that it's not.

Education Reform and School Choice


JOE ROGAN: I think in an ideal world education is free. In an ideal country where you really care about the people and you really want more success stories, education is free, difficult to get into, you have to be qualified, a true meritocracy. But education should be free. And if these certain people from different parts of the country don't seem to be getting in address that, figure out what's wrong with their school system and throw federal funds at that, it's not impossible to figure out why certain school systems are doing poorly and other ones are doing great.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I will tell you from a personal lens and perspective. So when I was in my freshman year in high school I moved up to LA with my mom and by the time I graduated I went to six high schools and an adult school that's actually I barely graduated. And what I will say is that one of the high schools I went.

JOE ROGAN: To watch them go to different schools.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It just how it ended up functioning. So my freshman year my mom went through a divorce, my dad got arrested. So I have an interesting background. So there was that lot of stuff. Yeah. But I ended up actually going to Venice High School one of these times. And that was around my junior year.

And what the LA Unified School District was doing at the time, they were actually busing in kids from other parts of LA County. And at the time, specifically in the early 2000s, there was a big issue with the black and Chicano gangs in LA. And so what was happening outside in the neighborhoods was carrying on into the school districts. And when you have gang activity and kids, the only opportunity that they have is being able to join a gang and that's it. They're never going to go to college, they're never going to have the opportunity. And so that carries on into the education system. They're never given a chance.

And so I think in Florida, we've been doing it right with school choice. President Trump's been pretty big on that. But being able to give students or their parents the ability to send them to good schools without gang activity outside of their zip code, that matters, and that does impact people.

JOE ROGAN: And cracking down on gang activity.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So there was a kid that was shot in the parking lot of my school. And shot and killed. You had actually pulled the article, Venice High School School shooting.

JOE ROGAN: No, listen, you don't have to tell me. Venice was crazy back.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Back before it was gentrified. It was rough.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. And it's kind of getting crazy now with homeless people.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I haven't been back since I basically left in. So when I was 19, I joined the military, and then my mom ended up leaving California with my little brother and sister probably about five years ago now.

JOE ROGAN: Venice is always such an interesting part of LA because it's like LA, but really weird. Weird people, interesting.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: LA is weird, though, as a whole.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. But Venice has a surf culture, Dog Town. Dog Town. There's a lot of people that are artists that live there that affects the vibe of the place. Venice in the 90s was really cool.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, in the early 2000s, it was cool too, but it was rough. I mean, I.

JOE ROGAN: What's always been filled with crime?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I got jumped. Yeah. And when I was jumped. Yeah, I got jumped in high school. I swear, part of the reason why I'm such a huge advocate for standing up to bullies is probably because of that. Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: Damn.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Venice was rough back in the day.

JOE ROGAN: I had a buddy of mine who lived there in the park where he used to take his kid. Someone got shot in it.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah.

JOE ROGAN: And he's like, “okay, great. Where do I take my kid now? I can't.”

Overcoming Adversity and Personal Stories


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Honestly. So seeing all that, though, being able to see that and then kind of tell that story, I do think that there's power in that because people. There's people that go through that and think, “man, I might not be able to be successful.” But that's not true. You can always fight your way out of it. I joined the military at 19. Best thing I ever did.

And I met a lot of other people in the military who grew up in inner city Chicago or wherever it was. They were able to go back and help their family and to my mom's credit, my mom also has an incredible story, but she had me at 20 years old, single mom. My dad ended up eventually getting clean, but my husband and I moved him in with us and then he got sober. And so that story in itself, I think, you tell your story and it empowers other people, especially to be fighters and not just give up.

JOE ROGAN: A lot of people have bad childhoods.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah. And people aren't going to tell you that. No one's going to be like, you know, but.

JOE ROGAN: But it's also great for someone to hear a story like yours or someone who came out of a similar childhood, maybe that they're having or maybe even worse than they're having. And you see what you've been able to do. That's powerful to people.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, and it is. And it's powerful, I think, to an idea that would box certain people, whether you're a woman or you're Hispanic, into this stereotype on how you should believe and think and.

JOE ROGAN: Vote or you're poor. You come from a single mom. I think that was one of the most important things about Obama becoming president. We heard, “oh, guys comes from a single mom and he became the president of the United States.” It was like, for a lot of people, it's like, “okay, relatable.” Yeah, well, maybe my life isn't what I wished it would be, but look what that guy's able to accomplish. Maybe I can do something too, instead of thinking I'm going to be a loser forever.

Media Attacks and Identity Politics


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, what was interesting is I shared my story. So remember I told you I started out as an activist and I would tell people this because I do feel like too, at a certain sense when you tell your story, you can share that you're empowering other people to take something and turn it into a positive.

And within maybe a couple weeks of me getting elected, I all of a sudden started having this Washington Post reporter reaching out to my family and actually asked my mom whether she had proof that my grandmother had actually passed away HIV positive.

JOE ROGAN: Oh, God.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And was harassing her.

JOE ROGAN: Trying to catch you.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Lies. Yeah. And so they put out this nasty, nasty article about me, basically trying to say that I had fabricated my dad's incarceration record. They had tried to say that I was a registered Democrat in Washington. All this stuff that was categorically false. And I had actually gotten contacted from my old target. Oh, it was terrible.

But I had receipts. And so after this came out. I said, “no, hold up.” And I actually gave Fox News all of my stuff that I had and I was able to refute. And then Time magazine had actually reached out and they said, “would you mind if we conduct an interview on your background?” I said, “have at it. Here's my information.” I had actually even gotten my DNA done to prove that I'm Hispanic because of the fact that I'm lighter skinned. When I got elected, there was this controversy on how Hispanic was I. And it was actually a thing. I'm like, I'm not. This is like Speedy Gonzalez with a sombrero running around. It's like, what am I supposed to be?

JOE ROGAN: That's so racist, guys. That's so racist. How is better. Isn't that funny that that's the time where the left is allowed to be racist?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It was so crazy.

JOE ROGAN: That is such a crazy thing to say. How Hispanic is she? How black are you exactly, Mr. Obama? You don't look that black to me.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It was crazy. But I actually gave all this information to Time magazine.

JOE ROGAN: Can you imagine saying that to Obama? How black are you?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: When people would ask me actually mention that to a reporter, actually, because of the fact that he's half white and half black. And I said, “I'm sorry, last time I checked, am I not allowed to be white too?” Because there's this aspect of I wasn't Hispanic enough because I'm white, but then also this aspect of I'm not white enough because I'm Hispanic. So which one are you?

JOE ROGAN: Oh, boy, that's so ridiculous. That's such a ridiculous thing to ask. It's like, it goes in the face of what's supposed to be about their principles. Their principles are supposed to be not seeing color at all.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, there's a lot.

JOE ROGAN: They're going to attack you and say you're pretending to be Hispanic or that you're barely Hispanic and not Hispanic enough. What percentage are you?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I'm half.

Political Attacks and Media Coverage


JOE ROGAN: That's 50 percent.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I'm so crazy. And then I had to explain, though, to a reporter, I said, “Well, if my mom's half and my dad's half, what does that make me?” And she goes, “A quarter.” I said, “No, that's not.”

JOE ROGAN: I'm 3/4 Italian. Imagine someone saying, “I'm not Italian.” That's hilarious. That's so racist. That's such a crazy thing that they allow it as long as it's coming from their side.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And also, too, if I were on the other side, I'd probably be like a rock star. So, long story short. So this article comes out. Time magazine investigates. After doing like 20 something hours on background, I gave them all the evidence and they actually ended up writing an article on me called “The Influencer that came to Congress” and then named me as Time magazine's next 100 most influential in the World.

JOE ROGAN: Well, that's nice of them.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I'm just glad that it vindicated me because it was not a fun spot to be in.

The Problem with Political Reporting


JOE ROGAN: It's just weird. I know that it's always going to be a part of politics, but it's so disruptive, disappointing as an enlightened culture that we don't disavow that kind of reporting and recognize from both sides how detrimental it is to finding out what's real and what's true.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It was done though, because of the fact that people like me specifically don't meet a certain stereotype. And so it was an effort to discredit that effort.

JOE ROGAN: I get it.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But it's like, for people, wondering why? And so I think most.

JOE ROGAN: People are going to know why they did it. It's pretty obvious. But it's just bizarre that we allow it as long as it's from our side. Progressives will allow like the most devious behaviors from their side. Republicans do the same thing, the most devious shit, as long as it's beneficial to their side.

That's what's really stupid and we need to disavow that. You could disagree with someone, don't think they're the right person for the job, vote against them. That's all great, but when you start deceiving people with false depictions of who a person is and making up a bunch of stupid shit and calling into question how Hispanic they are, it's so ridiculous.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Just stop.

JOE ROGAN: This is childish. It's like, this shouldn't be where we're at in 2025. It shouldn't be where we're at as a mature nation. We're 300 years old now. Figure it out.

Family Impact of Political Attacks


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It was, I think it was actually for my mom especially. I've been through the ringer politics. So I'm kind of battle hardened for it. I'm like, “Oh, another hippie.” So I don't care. But it was my mom and what she was subjected to. And I was like, my mom is really cool. She put herself through law school when I was in high school. She left an abusive marriage, she has come a long way. And so for her to be treated like that, I was like, it's like one thing in politics, you leave a family out of it.

JOE ROGAN: It's immoral, it's gross. And again, it's one of those things that we shouldn't tolerate, we shouldn't be doing it, we shouldn't advocate for it, we shouldn't be happy if it's done against the side that's ideologically opposed to other.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's gross.

JOE ROGAN: It's gross. It's gross. As a civilized group of human beings that calls itself a country, it's gross. There's other ways to do it. You don't have to just be a twat all the time.

Debate vs. Personal Attacks


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I prefer debating on ideology tends to be the best. But people always. It's like in fighting, you can't just go and sucker punch someone. It's kind of like the same thing. And that was kind of. They tried to sucker punch me and I was like, it's also Jackie Chan.

JOE ROGAN: You don't have to be fighting. If you believe what you believe and you have a rational argument, you can have a conversation. And this seems to be something that people don't want to do anymore. For some weird reason. They want to just stick to what they think, stick to what they believe. And they don't want to hear a rational opposing viewpoint because they're so married to their stupid ideas.

Social Media's Impact on Politics


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's a lot interesting how Congress functions when the cameras are off. And I think people would definitely change their opinion because a lot of people will do it for clicks. Ratings and social media has not helped with that because people are looking for what can go viral next.

There's like this viral theory that people, they think that they can only be successful in their policy or their argument, whether it's committee hearings or whatever, they want that clip that they can post and then get notoriety for. So social media has been both a blessing and a curse in this social media sphere or in the political sphere, because you can get your information out directly to the American people using it and refute bad information.

But then there's also this aspect of like, I wish people could see the conversations that take place behind the scenes because it wouldn't be so inflammatory, basically, is what I'm saying.

JOE ROGAN: That makes sense. Well, full transparency will come with the chip. Anna, just put the chip in your brain.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: No chips, don't put it.

JOE ROGAN: Everybody will have full transparency. It seems like this whole thing, your whole journey, becoming involved in politics has been pretty stressful.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's definitely not something I want my son to do.

Journey into Politics


JOE ROGAN: Is it what you thought it was? What did you think it was going to be like before you got in and what was different once you got in there?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So when I first started out in politics, I started out as. So I joined the military at 19. I paid my way through college. I wanted to be a doctor. So I got into a med school program at SGU in Grenada and I was supposed to go to that.

And then, I kid you not, like the day before I was supposed to leave, I got recruited to work for a nonprofit to basically help lead out Hispanic activism nationally. And I thought that's how I could make a difference. And then I realized that as part of that job they were putting me on television. I had a booker and so I was talking about stuff happening, but it was more the commentary on inflammatory things.

I actually wanted to address what was happening with human trafficking and I actually requested the State Department's report. I was a big activist with it. I was working with a non profit at the time and I realized that they only wanted me to talk about what was getting them the ratings. And so I did realize I was like, “Well they keep though talking about what people in D.C. are doing. So if I want to change the discussion, I have to go to Washington to do it.”

So I called my husband, I was like, “We're going to run for office.” He goes, “What do you mean we?”

JOE ROGAN: We?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, what do you mean? I was like, “Well, from what I gather, everyone's like a team effort” and it's totally true. If you're a spouse isn't on board, good luck because politics is nasty. And so he ended up basically figuring it out with me.

And for someone like me, there's no how to manual how to run from office. It's usually family, like literally family affairs where like people like their parent did it or they have like a direct immediate tie to it. So I figured it out and now that I'm in office, I'm realizing that I can make it impact to an extent with some influence. But it would be a lot more helpful if there were 10 other of me.

And so when I'm done in office, I'm going to help recruit younger candidates that have the ideological perspective I do to run them and then I'm going to help do things for them behind the scenes to help get them in.

JOE ROGAN: You're going to be a mastermind behind the scenes.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: To help.

The Broken System


JOE ROGAN: It just seems like a super broken process.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's so. I've traveled a lot. I've seen a lot of other parliaments. I'm a member of the House Democracy Partnership Institute. I've gone to a lot of countries. And we still have the best system.

JOE ROGAN: I believe that.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, but we need that.

JOE ROGAN: But I still believe it's a mess.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's a mess, though, because good people don't want to run. And they have to.

JOE ROGAN: Right.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Young people have to run.

JOE ROGAN: It's also a mess because the people that have been in positions of power for so long are so set in their ways and are so deeply ingrained in the system. And all the tension tentacles of all these different special interests and all the money that's all connected to all these decisions is so. It's just so. I don't know if it's possible to unwind all that stuff.

Fresh Blood and System Change


ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It is if you have enough fresh blood. So how do you shock a system? Right. And you need to infuse it. And so right now we have an interesting time period because we have division. So going back to kind of the declassification efforts that we've been working on. For the first time in U.S. history, you have an aspect of the government that's being transparent and releasing information. We're helping wherever we can on that.

But that is only possible because the right people with the right mindset were appointed in those agencies to be able to try to force the system to do something. But there's this aspect of. That's just the executive branch, but you have the legislative branch, and the legislative branch needs younger people that want to do this because they truly believe in fixing the system.

And you cannot be a pessimist in this job or else you will go crazy. Yeah, I would imagine you would go crazy. So you have to be an optimist and understand that there is a solution for it. And going back to kind of those quantum breadcrumbs. I've had enough stuff happen where I know I'm on the right path. But I also think that part of what I'm supposed to do is to help other people do this. So I'm going to help kind of execute that mission.

Future Plans


JOE ROGAN: How much longer are you going to be in office?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I don't know, but not definitely in the next 10 years, I promise you. I'm going to be with a beekeeper and a flip phone and that's it. No Internet. Just off the grid.

JOE ROGAN: Well, if I'm still doing a podcast. Then let's talk. Tell me about the. Hopefully then we'll know UFOs are real. They've already landed.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: At least we get some declassified stuff, right?

JOE ROGAN: Hopefully. Remember back when we didn't know who killed JFK?

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah. Well, now we know.

JOE ROGAN: Well, thank you very much for being here. Really appreciate.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Thank you.

JOE ROGAN: Bye, everybody.

Never miss a Delaware County story!

The one-bedroom Plank House in Marcus Hook is one of the oldest operating houses in Delaware County, and is said to be the home of the pirate Blackbeard.

“It dates back to the 1700s,” said Joshua Chjaires, founder of Phantom Detectives LLC. “At that time, Marcus Hook was a well-known shipping port. It has a lot of history of paranormal activity. People report seeing the spirit of Blackbeard's wife. They hear footsteps, crying, bangs.”

The paranormal investigative team based in Wilmington, Del. will visit the house and a graveyard out back, revealing their results at the Marcus Hook 17th Annual Pirate Festival on Saturday, Sept. 20, writes Kathleen E. Carey for the Daily Times.

Boothwyn native Melissa Ferrazzano is the medium on the team and has already sensed spirits days before the investigation.

Michael Manerchia ,of the Marcus Hook Preservation Society, won't  go into the house after dark after he and his wife experienced bedroom doors that opened and closed by themselves, in sync.

“You could walk in there in August, and it was 50 degrees. You could see your breath.”

A half a dozen paranormal groups have visited the Plank House, but nobody's lasted a full night, Manerchia said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=paranormal","Aap Ki Adalat: 'I want to study about ghosts, paranormal activity at Oxford or Cambridge,' says Bageshwar Baba","https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/aap-ki-adalat-i-want-to-study-about-ghosts-paranormal-activity-at-oxford-or-cambridge-says-bageshwar-baba-dhirendra-shastri-2025-08-23-1004846","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 16:27:13 GMT","

In a free-wheeling interview with Rajat Sharma in 'Aap Ki Adalat', Bageshwar Dham chief Pandit Dhirendra Krishna Shastri expressed his desire ""to study about ghosts and paranormal activity at Oxford or Cambridge University"". In the interview, Bageshwar Baba also revealed how his mother blessed President Droupadi Murmu by putting her hand on her head and saying, ""May you achieve higher posts"" (Aur oonchey pad par jao).


Pandit Dhirendra Shastri disclosed several hilarious anecdotes about his stay in London, his meeting with the New Zealand Prime Minister and his extended fortune-telling session with the Mauritius President.

Asked on which subject he wants to do his PhD study, Dhirendra Shastri said, ""My idea is to do some PhD work in either Cambridge or Oxford University on ghosts. I know all of you will laugh. In Oxford, Cambridge and several universities of the US, there are studies going on on paranormal subjects. 'Paranormal' means invisible forces (adrishya shaktiyan). To know about ghosts. My work is to dispel ghosts (bhoot bhagaana). In our country, some members of Andha Shraddha Nirmoolan Samiti of Maharashtra pointed fingers at me, and the same day I made up my mind (to study). I will bring my certificate, and I will work on facts. Till now, whatever I am doing is due to the blessings of my Guru. By linking with science and doing a PhD on paranormal activity, I will dispel negativism among people.""



Pandit Dhirendra Shastri recalled how he had told his mother not to put her hand on the head of President Droupadi Murmu because she is the Head of State. In February this year, the President had visited Bageshwar Dham to bless the 251 couples whose marriage was arranged by the baba.

Dhirendra Shastri said, ""My mother is not literate; she lives in a village. When Rashtrapati Ji visited Bageshwar Dham on February 26 for darshan of Balaji, she attended the 'havan'. She asked, 'Where is your mom?' I replied, 'My mom is in the village, but because of police security protocol, she could not come.' Rashtrapati Ji said, 'Please call her here; I want to meet her.' My mom met Rashtrapati Ji in the green room. I had told my mom in advance not to put her hand on her head, as she usually does. When the two met, Rashtrapati Ji told her, 'You are very fortunate to have such a son, who is helping so many daughters to marry.' The two hugged each other, and suddenly my mom forgot my advice. She put her hand on Rashtrapati Ji's head and said, ""Aur oonchey pad par jao."" I caught my mom's hand and said, 'She is the First Lady of the nation, and there is no other post above that.' Rashtrapati Ji smiled and said, 'Let her bless.' It was a great moment (abhootpoorva kshan). Rashtrapati Ji was so humble. She did not take it amiss and smiled. She brought a saree for her and said, ""Bahut accha hai.""

At his meeting with the New Zealand Prime Minister in June this year, Bageshwar Baba said, ""The New Zealand Prime Minister came to meet me. I was tense, and there was pressure on my mind about what to speak. As soon as we met, he said, 'Welcome, welcome, Bageshwar Baba.' I replied, ""Thank you, thank you, thank you."" What more could I say? I didn't know English. At the end, I said, ""Sorry, I cannot speak in English, but I understand.""

""I will only give this advice to our people: do not commit the mistake that I did. Let your children study. Whether you give clothes or not to your kids, do give them education. If you give education and good 'sanskar' to your daughters, your work is done. It's not that we can't learn English. We can learn. We have the desire to learn, and at the same time, we should support Hindi and Hindutva.""

Asked by Rajat Sharma how he took out the 'parcha' (note) of the Mauritius President when he didn't know English, Pandit Dhirendra Shastri replied, ""In Mauritius, I met both the President and Prime Minister. One of my disciples said, 'Guruji, it'd be better if you gave them blessings.' I was in two minds about what to do. I prayed to Hanuman Ji to help me. My Guru Maharaj helped me. Earlier, the time was fixed for 15 minutes, then it stretched to 30 minutes. A translator was there. I was asked whether I had the 'parcha'. I said, 'I will try to understand what is being said for the first 15 minutes.' Then my engine will warm up within an hour. I prayed to Hanumanji, and he kept my 'laaj' (shame). I told the translator, 'Tell him that such and such ""lafda"" (problem) is there, and there is something which I cannot reveal before others.' He sent away his security personnel and closed the door. He, the translator and I – three of us – sat for one and a half hours. I was served nice tea and water. I chanted Jai Bajrang Bali in my mind. The translator was happy. He later told me, ""I never knew hamare sahab ke itna raaz hain (my saheb had so many secrets).""

Asked why the Ambanis sent a special plane to Australia for attending Anant Ambani's wedding reception in July last year, Dhirendra Shastri replied, ""I was called there (bulaya gaya). The manner in which they arranged their 'vivah parampara' (wedding tradition) and mangalik karya and made the 'utsav' a 'mahotsav' with Sanatan sanskriti (culture) is amazing. There are many rich (ameer) people in our country, but their ameeri (richness) should be such that you have sadhus, leaders, actors, sants, and mahants all getting due respect and honour. I loved it. When they said, 'You have to come,' and when he (Anant) said, 'I won't become a 'dulha' unless you come...' He calls me Dada... I told him, ""I have my 'katha' in Australia; I will lose my dakshina (donations); badi aafat ho jayega."" He replied, ""Aap tension na lo, aapki katha pe hum plane bhejenge."" So they sent this big Cheel-Gaadi (chartered plane). It was nice. Sleeping inside the plane. There was an arrangement to take a bath inside the plane. Gazab ki hawai jahaz thi. Hum toh bhagwan se keh rahe they ki aise har baar bheje jo jo humko bula rahe. (To Rajat Sharma). Ab aapne nahin bheji (to attend Aap Ki Adalat), woh aapki kami hai.""

Rajat Sharma: They sent a Rolls-Royce to the airport?

Dhirendra Shastri: The second time when I went to Vantara, there was a small event. Sach batayen jitne bhi hain, apne baap ki kuch bhi nahin. (To tell you the truth, whatever I have got is not my father's.) For me and my life, poori duniya mehmaan hai, aati hai, chali jati hai. I sat in the Rolls-Royce car. Mazaa le liya. Ulta gate khulta hai."" (Its door opens from reverse.)

When Rajat Sharma showed him pictures of him wearing branded glasses and a jacket, Dhirendra Shastri replied, ""No, it was only one. Baaki toh bahut low quality ke 60 rupaye, 20 rupaye wale bhi hain. My disciples give them to me. They love me. They insist, saying, 'Guruji, aap ek baar pehen ke dikha do, hamen khushi hogi.' Hum pehan lete hain. I think, yeh bura nahin hai. I have never taken sanyas, nor am I a sadhu. When I am not a sadhu, there is nothing wrong in wearing them.""

Shastri went on: ""If rapists in our country can live in bungalows worth crores, if naachne wala can live in bungalows worth billions, then what's wrong if somebody gives a chashma to a sadhu? Woh bhi jee sakta hai, yaar. Yeh koi burai nahin hai. But yes, I do not have aasakti (attachment), nor anasakti (non-attachment); I don't have apeksha (expectation), and mana bhi nahin (there is no prohibition). Forget Rolls-Royce, did anybody show the news about how I travelled in a bullock cart in Maharashtra? Nobody showed that news. There was mud all around. I went in a bullock cart to attend a katha. We have done much good work, but nobody showed that, but everybody discussed my glasses and my jacket.""

SETI Researchers Reveal Where Aliens Could Spot Earth's Deep Space Signals","https://thedebrief.org/is-anybody-out-there-seti-researchers-reveal-where-aliens-could-spot-earths-deep-space-signals/","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 13:12:22 GMT","

Scientists engaged in the search for extraterrestrial life (SETI) have flipped the script, asking where alien civilizations would most likely detect evidence of humanity. By identifying the best vantage points for outsiders to notice Earth's signals, researchers hope to refine strategies in the search for intelligent life.

The work was a collaboration between scientists at Penn State and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which analyzed how alien observers might detect Earth's deep-space transmissions. The study, presented in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and at the 2025 Penn State SETI Symposium, examined when and where such observations would be most likely — and how those patterns could be reversed to improve SETI efforts.

“SETI researchers often search the universe for signs of past or present technology, called technosignatures, as evidence of intelligent life,” said lead author Pinchen Fan, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State's Eberly College of Science. “Considering the direction and frequency of our most common signals gives insights into where we should be looking to improve our chances of detecting alien technosignatures.”

Using NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN), which tracks communications between Earth and interplanetary spacecraft, the team compiled two decades of public transmission logs. By comparing the timing and direction of transmissions with the positions of spacecraft, the researchers built a detailed record of Earth-to-space communications. While other nations maintain similar networks, the focus was on NASA's logs, as the agency has conducted more deep-space missions than any other.

“NASA's Deep Space Network provides the crucial link between Earth and its interplanetary missions like the New Horizons spacecraft, which is now outbound from the Solar System, and the James Webb Space Telescope,” said co-author Joseph Lazio, project scientist at JPL. “It sends some of humanity's strongest and most persistent radio signals into space, and the public logs of its transmissions allowed our team to establish the temporal and spatial patterns of those transmissions for the past 20 years.”

When reviewing the logs, the team focused on deep-space transmissions to space telescopes and other spacecraft, while ignoring low-Earth orbit communications, as their low power would make them far less likely to be detected by a distant civilization.

The most common targets for Earth-space transmissions were Mars, followed by Sun-Earth Lagrange points, positions in space where the Sun and Earth's gravities keep telescopes in relatively fixed positions from an Earthly perspective.

”Based on data from the last 20 years, we found that if an extraterrestrial intelligence were in a location that could observe the alignment of Earth and Mars, there's a 77% chance that they would be in the path of one of our transmissions — orders of magnitude more likely than being in a random position at a random time,” Fan said.

“If they could view an alignment with another solar-system planet, there is a 12% chance they would be in the path of our transmissions. When not observing a planet alignment, however, these chances are minuscule.”

Based on their analysis, the researchers recommend identifying when exoplanets align with their host stars and targeting those opportunities in the search for technosignatures. Fortunately, this is something that astronomers are already largely doing, as the darkening of a star by a crossing exoplanet is one of the easiest methods for detecting such bodies. 

“However, because we are only starting to detect a lot of exoplanets in the last decade or two, we do not know many systems with two or more transiting exoplanets,” Fan said. “With the upcoming launch of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, we expect to detect a hundred thousand previously undetected exoplanets, so our potential search area should increase greatly.”

Most of the transmissions examined occurred within about five degrees of Earth's orbital plane, due to the flat layout of the solar system. Based on their calculations, such signals could be detectable up to 23 light-years away by a civilization with technology comparable to ours. To build on this, the team proposes cataloging exoplanets within 23 light-years whose orbital planes align edge-on with Earth.

The researchers add that other methods of communication — such as laser-based systems now being tested by NASA — could also be detectable, though their spillover signals would be far narrower.

“Humans are pretty early in our spacefaring journey, and as we reach further into our solar system, our transmissions to other planets will only increase,” said co-author Jason Wright, professor of astronomy and astrophysics in the Penn State Eberly College of Science and director of the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center. 

“Using our own deep space communications as a baseline, we quantified how future searchers for extraterrestrial intelligence could be improved by focusing on systems with particular orientations and planet alignments,” Wright concluded.

The paper, “Detecting Extraterrestrial Civilizations that Employ an Earth-level Deep Space Network,” appeared in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on August 21, 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","The 'Supernatural' Star You'd Least Expect Directed More Episodes of the 93% RT Hit Series Than Jensen Ackles","https://collider.com/supernatural-trickster-richard-speight-jr-director/","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 17:18:00 GMT","

With over 300 episodes to choose from, there were bound to be a few episodes of Supernatural that were helmed by members of the show's cast. While Jared Padalecki never directed an episode, Jensen Ackles, Misha Collins, and several of the show's recurring guest stars found their way into the director's chair over the years. However, none were more prolific or effective in furthering the show's creative vision than Richard Speight Jr., the star who played the Trickster (aka Gabriel) from Season 2 of the show onwards. Yes, the Trickster was behind nearly a dozen episodes in the show's back half, episodes that helped Supernatural stay relevant in its declining years.

First appearing in the show's second season, Richard Speight Jr. quickly became a fan-favorite during the Kripke Era. Episodes like the time-warp hour ""Mystery Spot"" and Season 5's journey through TV Land ""Changing Channels"" remain some of the most beloved of the entire series, even now, and not even Gabriel's supposed death kept him off the show. Speight's role on Supernatural really took a turn after the actor (who long held aspirations of being a director) helmed his own short film, America 101. ""I used that short film to crack into the commercial world,"" Speight told Variety, adding that every commerical he directed, he would send to Supernatural producers Robert Singer and Phil Sgriccia. ""I kept them abreast of everything because I wanted them to, A: see that the short film wasn't a fluke, and B: show them that I was serious about it…"" From there, Speight shadowed Singer, Sgriccia, and other directors until it was time for him to tackle his own episode.

Speight would end up directing a total of 11 episodes of the show, tied with Guy Norman Bee as the show's seventh most recurring director. Speight's big break came with Season 11's ""Just My Imagination,"" a comedic look into the concept of imaginary friends that felt like an episode Speight should've guest-starred in as the Trickster. It's a significant hour that expands further on Sam Winchester's childhood, mixing it masterfully with heartfelt humor. In fact, it was so well-received that Speight was brought back for two episodes in Season 12: the killer Reservoir Dogs-style ""Stuck In the Middle (With You)"" (easily the season's best) and the witch-centric ""Twigs & Twine & Tasha Banes."" Again, Speight more than proved himself capable of commanding the Supernatural ship, and he would be invited back for Season 13 as well — but this time with a twist.

While Season 13's ""War of the Worlds"" was Speight's standard Winchester fare, the show took a harsh turn midway through the season by bringing the actor/director back in a recurring capacity, revealing that Gabriel faked his death back in the fifth season. During his six-episode guest arc, Speight's second episode that year as a director was ""Unfinished Business,"" where he played the dual roles of Gabriel and Loki, the pagan god whose identity the Trickster had stolen years earlier. ""What I found helpful was compartmentalizing — because to look at it as one giant elephant, it was more than the brain could comprehend,"" Speight explained later. ""It wasn't just that my character was in the show — he is the main guest star, and the second guest star is also me."" After Gabriel was killed off for real, Speight returned to direct two episodes of Season 14 and a whopping four episodes of the show's fifteenth and final season, having impressed the showrunners enough with his off-screen abilities.

It's no secret that Supernatural's later seasons are not considered the show's best. From uneven plotlines, hard-to-ignore retcons, and stories that often retread the show's golden years, the final Dabb and Singer Era is generally thought of as its most uninspired. And yet, this is the era of Supernatural where Richard Speight Jr. thrived as a director, perhaps because he does so well to focus on one episode at a time. Even when he helmed episodes that spoke to the show's greater mytharc, like ""Gods and Monsters"" in Season 14 or Season 15's ""Our Father, Who Aren't In Heaven,"" it was his vision for the show that came through. His unique understanding of character shines through, which is likely why each of his episodes are some of the highest rated of their respective seasons. ""Proverbs 17:3,"" for example, is a standard hunt on the surface, but through clever uses of camera and intense direction, it quickly stands out among the show's final episodes.

To say that Speight was vital to Supernatural's final years would be an understatement, as his relationship with the show's cast and crew created a natural environment for creativity. When speaking with Nerds & Beyond, Speight revealed that he took many directorial cues from Singer and Sgriccia, who hold the most director credits on the show. ""That was very illuminating because you do start to see a style,"" he explained. ""I think sometimes we as TV viewers don't realize that directors are bringing a flair to the show because their episodes are not back to back."" It's true that certain directors can bring unique show-defining tones to a show. Both Singer and Sgriccia (who had been with Supernatural since Season 1) certainly added emotional layers and visual distinctions that suck with the rest of the program, ideas that Speight would utilize and expand on in his own work.

It also helped that the actor-turned-director worked very closely with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki early on to thrive as a new-coming captain. ""I had a pre-episode dinner with Jared and Jensen, who understood the task that I was facing and volunteered early on to 'let us help you,'"" Speight told Variety. ""I trust them as actors, they trust me as an actor, and if we got in a scene, and it wasn't clicking, we'd tell ourselves we need another take."" Speight's ability to work so organically with the show's cast is part of why his episodes shine, with powerful and emotive performances that highlight the best the show has to offer.

After ""Just My Imagination,"" he'd shown that his potential behind the camera was perhaps even greater than his work in front of it. By the show's end, he was just as well-known behind-the-scenes as he was on-screen, directing as many episodes as he appeared in as the Trickster. Speight's attention to detail and ability to inspire meaningful and dynamic performances from his stars made his work stand out in a show that often struggled to stay fresh. The actor/director took great care to breathe new life into Sam and Dean's adventures. It's no wonder he was brought back for more when The Winchesters came around, and has continued to direct since.

Wednesday was a smash hit upon its debut on November 23, 2022. Its first season centered on the titular Addams Family member enrolling at Nevermore Academy and becoming embroiled in a dark mystery involving several grisly murders on the school grounds. Wednesday's first run secured an impressive 73% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and obtained an 85% approval rating from audiences on the same site's Popcornmeter. Tim Burton's gothic style meshed perfectly with the world of the Addams Family, delivering the definitive interpretation of the classic popular culture icons. This made it rather unsurprising when Wednesday was renewed for a second season.

Wednesday has recently returned for its latest installments. This time, the mystery concerns an enigmatic stalker who has been following Wednesday since she became famous for taking down Hyde, and Wednesday's visions of Enid's demise. Its second season boasts one of the greatest casts of all time. Alongside returning favorites, Wednesday Season 2 introduces a new roster of characters played by some of the world's biggest film and television actors. It is easily one of the most star-studded casts of any Netflix drama series, and the actors' rapport together is apparent. The stars of Wednesday make it must-see television.

Wednesday's friends and family, in particular, have incredible chemistry. The Addams Family is perfectly cast. Jenny Ortega is both hilarious and interesting as Wednesday Addams, with her dark humor and her expert sleuthing skills making her a fun protagonist. Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia Addams bounces off Wednesday and the Nevermore students nicely, delivering some brilliantly dry sarcasm, like how she claims she makes Gomez believe he is ""in charge of this family."" Morticia's dynamic with Luis Guzman's Gomez Addams is extremely convincing, capturing the feel of a husband and wife team who have been together for many years.

Wednesday Season 2 makes the smart decision to base all the Addams Family within the Nevermore Academy site, giving Wednesday deeper personal connections to her life at the school. Pugsley begins his studies at Nevermore, portrayed excellently by Isaac Ordonez. His wide-eyed enthusiasm for horrific creatures, such as his pet zombie Slurp, brings some great moments of levity to the series, making his socially awkward roommate, Eugene Ottinger, apprehensive about this new addition to the school.

The biggest standout of Wednesday is Emma Myers' Enid Sinclair. Her friendship with Wednesday is odd, because of Wednesday and Enid's contrasting personalities. While Wednesday can be a cold and distant figure, Enid is a bright and cheery individual. However, Jenny Ortega and Enid Sinclair's strong rapport is evident throughout Wednesday's episodes, and sells their complicated friendship.

Jenny Ortega fondly described her co-star as a ""badass"" during Wednesday's second season, and discussed how Emma Myers makes her ""job so much easier,"" indicating that their off-screen camaraderie is as powerful as it is onscreen. Wednesday and Enid's fierce loyalty towards one another has left fans convinced they will eventually become a couple, believing there may be some romantic subtext behind their pairing. This has been fueled further by Enid's declaration that she cannot ""imagine"" her life without Wednesday in it. Jenny Ortega and Enid Sinclair have made Wednesday and Enid feel inseparable.

Wednesday Season 2 has some major names among its cast. Among the most iconic is Joanna Lumley, who features as Grandmama Addams. The fractious relationship between Morticia and her mother, Grandmama, is one of the most fascinating aspects of Wednesday's second season. Its early episodes hint at the mother and daughter not getting along, when Bianca tries to persuade Morticia to contact Grandmama to see if she would donate money to Nevermore Academy.

Morticia is so reluctant to get in touch with her mother that it takes Bianca to use her siren powers to force Morticia to call her. Joanna Lumley brings a fresh new dynamic to the Addams Family, with Grandmama's sharp tongue and manipulative personality causing tension between her and Morticia. Wednesday and Grandmama's relationship as granddaughter and grandmother is also enjoyable to watch, as Grandmama is the one person in their family who Wednesday feels the closest to. It generates some intense jealousy from Morticia toward Grandmama, which creates some great personal drama for the Netflix show.

Another excellent inclusion to the Wednesday cast is Billie Piper. She plays Nevermore Academy's music teacher, Isadora Capri. Isadora's deep passion for music is evident throughout Wednesday, attempting to secure Wednesday for the school orchestra. Billie Piper is exceptional in the part, bringing her own love for music to her take on Nevermore's newest staff member, and imbuing the character with a brilliant writ. The character makes great use of Billie Piper's past as a pop singer, bursting into occasional song numbers during Wednesday Season 2.

As a werewolf, she also holds a special bond with Enid, giving Enid someone to confide in outside of Wednesday. Isadora brings out the best in Nevermore's quirky characters, like Wednesday and Enid, allowing them to shine brighter than in Wednesday's first season. Billie Piper bounces off nicely with both Jenny Ortega and Emma Myers, integrating seamlessly with the Nevermore expanded cast. Watching Wednesday Season 2, it feels as though Billie Piper has always been a part of the TV Series, even though the show's second run marks her first appearance. The Netflix series would be wise to keep Billie Piper for a potential third season.

Christopher Lloyd is the biggest name attached to Wednesday. The Back To The Future star features during the second season as Professor Orlov. He is Nevermore's longest-serving teacher, delivering lessons in biology. Professor Orlov fits Christopher Lloyd's acting style magnificently, playing a typically eccentric role as a head in a jar. His intense dislike of troublemakers results in him developing an entertaining rivalry with Pugsley.

Professor Orlov disapproves of Pugsley's mischievous behavior, and his strong principles make him a superb antagonist for Pugsley during his stay at the Nevermore Academy. Christopher Lloyd's casting as Professor Orlov also serves as a magnificent tribute to the Addams Family franchise's history. He previously depicted Uncle Fester in the 1990s Addams Family movies. Wednesday's second season shows the introduction of a new principal to Nevermore Academy. Reservoir Dogs actor Steve Buscemi takes on Nevermore's new school head, Barry Dort.

He is fantastically over-the-top as the villainous school principal. Barry's cruel manipulation of Bianca, threatening her scholarship and manipulating her into using her siren powers on Morticia, is unnerving. He maintains a happy-go-lucky demeanor while threatening his students, appearing unfazed by Wednesday burning down the portrait of herself and her friends in Season 2's opener, while informing Bianca that he will remove her scholarship if she does not comply with securing the school's extra funding.

Steve Buscemi's exaggerated performance contrasts amusingly with Wednesday's blunt demeanor, making Wednesday an excellent foil for the Nevermore Academy principal. His distrust of ""normies"" without supernatural abilities adds an interesting cynical angle to his character, believing that Nevermore's outcasts can never properly integrate with those without these gifts, and that Nevermore must be separated from these people to keep the students safe. Barry believes he is acting in Nevermore's best interests but, in reality, his actions serve only to alienate the school's residents from the rest of society.

Industry Trends: Why Demand for Free Psychic Readings is Growing

The psychic services industry has historically faced skepticism, but recent market studies indicate accelerating growth in digital-first platforms. Several factors contribute to this expansion:

Global Stress Levels – Increased social, financial, and relationship pressures are driving individuals toward intuitive wellness practices.

Digital Habits – Just as fitness apps and meditation tools have become mainstream, psychic reading online free services are finding a foothold as trusted wellness resources.

The Psychic Experts platform provides a range of interactive formats, recognizing that no two individuals prefer the same approach. Available options include:

Free online psychic chat for instant typed exchanges.

Free psychic reading phone call for verbal conversation and emotional nuance.

The Bigger Picture: Intuition as Part of the Wellness Movement

Wellness is no longer limited to fitness, nutrition, or meditation. Intuition-based practices are increasingly seen as essential tools for emotional balance. For many, a free psychic love question or a psychic reading online free session acts as a quick reset — helping them process emotions, make decisions, or simply feel heard.

Industry observers note that this trend aligns with the rise of digital self-care tools. Just as millions of people now rely on mental health apps or guided meditation platforms, a growing segment is embracing free psychic readings as an accessible form of intuitive wellness.

Raising the Bar in a Crowded Industry

The online psychic sector has experienced explosive growth in the last decade, but it remains an industry riddled with skepticism. Many providers still rely on vague promises, upselling tactics, or paywalls disguised as “free trials.” By contrast, The Psychic Experts are redefining what users can expect from free psychic reading online and free psychic chat platforms.

At the heart of their model is a commitment to ethical practice, cutting-edge technology, and uncompromising privacy standards. In 2025, when online trust is fragile, this combination has established the-psychic-experts.com as the most accurate and trusted source for psychic readings free of hidden agendas or gimmicks.

Live trial readings with expert reviewers.

Ethical and emotional intelligence assessments.

Background verification and skill demonstrations.

Ongoing evaluations based on user ratings and performance monitoring.

No upselling pressure — users are free to end a session at any time without obligation.

No storage of private questions or personal data.

By enforcing these standards, the platform builds long-term trust and ensures that every psychic reading free remains a positive and empowering experience.

Transparency in What “Free” Truly Means

The company's commitment is clear:

Free means free.

Clear labeling of services. Paid options, for those who choose to upgrade later, are transparently presented without pressure.

This transparency is setting a new standard in digital psychic services, reinforcing why the-psychic-experts.com is rapidly becoming the global leader in trusted psychic reading online free platforms.

Additionally, the platform leverages AI-assisted advisor matching to connect users with psychics best suited for their specific questions — whether that's a free psychic love reading, a free psychic question yes or no, or a free psychic reading by date of birth and time.

This combination of human intuition and smart technology ensures that sessions are both authentic and relevant, maximizing value for users worldwide.

Psychic Guidance as Emotional Support — Not Entertainment

Another key way The Psychic Experts stand apart is by reframing psychic guidance as a form of emotional wellness support rather than entertainment. While fortune-telling tropes still dominate public perception, the platform emphasizes clarity, compassion, and actionable insights.

Users often seek out a free psychic reading not to predict the winning lottery numbers, but to gain clarity on:

Love and relationships.

Career transitions.

Family dynamics.

Spiritual awakening.

Personal growth and healing.

This holistic focus aligns psychic services with the broader wellness movement, where tools like meditation, therapy, and coaching are already normalized. In 2025, intuitive guidance is joining this ecosystem — and The Psychic Experts are leading the way.

Shostakovich: Symphonies; Concertos; Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk District Yuja Wang (piano), Baiba Skride (violin), Yo-Yo Ma (cello), Boston Symphony Orchestra/Andris Nelsons (DG)

Shostakovich: The Symphonies Gürzenich-Orchester Köln/Dmitrij Kitajenko (Capriccio)

Here are two big Shostakovich boxes, released to mark the 50th anniversary of the composer's death. Dmitri Kitajenko's symphony cycle, a mixture of studio and live performances, was recorded between 2002 and 2004. Originally boxed up as a set of SACDs. Capriccio's budget priced reissue gives us just the stereo mix, the engineering consistently impressive across three different venues. Andris Nelsons' live performances were taped between 2015 and 2024, his set including the six concertos and the opera Lady Macbeth. Both boxes contain great things but serve as a reminder that it's rare for one conductor to get everything right.

Nelsons recorded the middle-period symphonies first, his readings of nos. 4 to 11 spectacularly well-played and brilliantly engineered. It's good to hear an orchestra as plush as the Boston Symphony letting rip, the scarier outbursts in Symphonies 7 and 8 really hitting home. The string playing in No. 5's great “Largo” is exquisite, and No. 6's long, enigmatic opening movement is brilliantly sustained, followed by pin-sharp performances of the two scherzos. I really enjoyed Nelsons' 9th too, the third movement's blend of exhilaration and panic perfectly judged, the bassoon soliloquy before the finale providing a welcome moment of gravitas. Symphony No. 10 is as good as any recent performance I've heard, the closing minutes exultant. It won't supplant Karel Ancerl's sizzling 1955 DG recording in my affections, Ancerl one of the few conductors who actually observes the moderato tempo marking in the first movement. Nelsons takes nearly 26 minutes, Ancerl barely 20.

The other symphonies aren't as distinctive, though No. 14 has decent solo singing from soprano Kristine Opolais and bass Alexander Tsymbalyuk, and the final pages of No. 15 are affecting. Nelsons includes some orchestral extras, the suites from incidental music which Shostakovich composed for stage productions of Hamlet and King Lear brilliantly characterised. What else? I enjoyed Yuja Wang's percussive, full-blooded accounts of the two piano concertos, and Baiba Skride is especially good in the neglected Violin Concerto No. 2. Yo-Yo Ma's new version of the Cello Concerto No. 1 isn't as exciting as his early 1980s Sony recording, he and Nelsons better in the haunting, introspective sequel. Nelsons' live Lady Macbeth fills three discs instead of the usual two and can't match the Rostropovich studio recording in terms of intensity, despite Opolais's performance in the lead role.. No libretto is provided, though you'll find one online easily enough.

Kitajenko is less flamboyant but interpretatively more consistent. Compare his Symphony No. 1 with Nelsons', Kitajenko's swifter tempi suiting the work so much better. Shostakovich's epic 4th Symphony is excellent, Cologne's Gürzenich-Orchester playing out of their collective skins, and No. 5 is sober but powerful, the first movement's quiet coda really unsettling. The zippier moments in Nos. 6 and 9 showcase some virtuosic solo wind playing, and the brass in No. 7 have weight. This 8th is very broad, its first movement lasting almost 30 minutes, but Kitajenko prevents the piece from sprawling. Listen to the tam-tam at the start of the great “Largo”, and at how tenderly the Cologne players negotiate the shift to C major at the movement's end, as if they're cautiously emerging from a dungeon into hazy light.

Alas, Symphony No. 10's “Moderato” is too much slow for my liking and Kitajenko's steady tempo in the finale's faster section prevents the music from ever catching fire. No. 11 is superb, though, and I'll admit to having enjoyed this No. 12. Having the Prague Philharmonic Chorus really helps Symphonies 2, 3 and 13, bass Arutjun Kotchinian imposing in “Babi Yar”, and joined by soprano Marina Shaguch in No.14. 15 is impressive, with some sonorous brass providing the last movement's Wagner quote and a perfectly judged coda. Documentation is good, the original releases' sleeve essays handily squeezed into a single thick booklet. Both box sets represent really good value. Nelsons' package contains enticing extras but Kitajenko is a more reliable guide to the symphonies. Next up is Gianandrea Noseda's LSO Live Shostakovich cycle, due for release in a few months' time.

Ben Folds Live with the National Symphony Orchestra Ben Folds, National Symphony Orchestra/Steven Reineke (John F Kennedy Center)

This album only really sneaks into the Classical column, as an orchestral take on the songs of Ben Folds, a singer-songwriter who has been entertaining me for thirty years since he first emerged, like Billy Joel's punkish kid brother in the 90s. His career has had great range, including, alongside ‘straight' pop albums, films scores, a piano concerto – and, just this week, songs for the new Peanuts musical. For eight years he served as Artistic Adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington DC, resigning in February on the same day Donald Trump personally took over management of the Kennedy Center. This release is his final collaboration with the orchestra, captured in live performance in October 2024.

Given that Folds' songs are mainly piano-led – he is a quite extraordinary pianist – it is perhaps surprising how well so many of the songs translate to orchestra. Folds sings, and plays the piano on some tracks, but it is the orchestra that is the focus. The songs largely come from later in his career, including a couple that were orchestral in their original guises. The best of this collection come from his most recent full album, 2023's What Matters Most, including the opener, “But Wait, There's More”, which is brilliantly scored, as if the original is just a sketch for this expansion. It's a shame that the CD doesn't give any orchestrator credits at all. A bit of online burrowing identifies the album's orchestrators as Jherek Bischoff, Alex Turley, Eric Allen, and Rob Moose, and they deserve to be more front and centre. Heartbreakingly beautiful – and heartbreakingly sad – is “Kristine From the 7th Grade”, which examines the phenomenon of lockdown radicalisation through an exquisite waltz. It makes me cry.

The riotous “Effington” is one of Folds' most infectious creations, here with a motoric rhythm propelled by snare drum, and it works well with a choir and audience participation. Likewise “You Don't Know Me”, where Folds is joined (as on the album version) by Regina Spektor, as a song about a dysfunctional relationship becomes a feelgood singalong with marching strings and a tinkly celesta interlude.

There is introspection on “Still Fighting It”, with gorgeous horn and trumpet spots, and “Landed”, where Folds' singing is as good as ever, and the orchestra is given full rein, conductor Steven Reineke allowing just the right about of sentimentality. If you don't know Ben Folds this album is a good place to start – although I might also recommend the recent What Matters Most, or for something older, Songs for Silverman – and it is testament to the varied work of the National Symphony Orchestra in uncertain times for them.

Wonderings and Other Revelations – chamber works and songs by Edith Hemenway, Thomas Oboe Lee et al Nancy Braithwaite (clarinet), Claron McFadden (soprano), Vaughan Schlepp (piano) (Etcetera)

Wonderings and Other Revelations is the apt title for clarinettist Nancy Braithwaite's second album for the Dutch/Belgian label Etcetera. Whereas the first (To Paradise for Onions, 2019), was an overdue exploration of the work of the then 92-year-old American composer Edith Hemenway, this new release casts the net wider and represents a broader picture, including several works which Braithwaite herself – also the producer of the album – has either commissioned or inspired. 

Edith Hemenway, an American composer in the lineage of Stephen Foster and Aaron Copland, died in 2023, and the works presented here are an eloquent memorial to her. Hemenway's long and influential friendship with Braithwaite began when the clarinettist, still in her early twenties, was principal player in the Savannah (Georgia) Symphony Orchestra.  The title track “Wonderings” is a lyrical cello piece of just under five minutes, and one of the highlights of the album is some very appealing songs by Hemenway to texts by Maya Angelou, Emily Dickinson and others, the vocal part ideally suited to the bright and agile soprano voice of the excellent Claron McFadden.

Composer Thomas Oboe Lee, another long-term friend of Braithwaite, has one of those life stories you really couldn't or wouldn't make up. Born in Beijing in 1945, he spent his teens and early twenties in Sao Paulo where his jazz flute skills allowed him to ride the bossa nova wave alongside luminaries such as Chico Buarque. Then followed a move to Boston, to composing and teaching composition – the touching story of his first collaboration with Braithwaite is well told. In the time since he settled there, he has been a multiple Guggenheim and NEA awardee. The work here, Yo Picasso, is a fascinatingly varied quartet for clarinet, viola, cello and piano in five fleeting movements drawing inspiration from periods in the painter's creative life.

From the other pieces on the album, the listener starts to put together a portrait of the clarinettist, and the album booklet eloquently tells the stories of how her own life and musical career have intersected with those of the composers whose works are included. Braithwaite moved from her native Illinois to Holland in the early 1980's, and the centrepiece is a virtuoso solo Sonata from 1985 by the ‘conductor, pianist, organist, composer and church musician' who was to become her husband, Oane Wierdsma (1954-2008). In Braithwaite's focused and assertive tone I think I can hear an echo of her one-time teacher, the eminent Larry Combs whose three decades as principal clarinet of the Chicago Symphony are the stuff of legend, although Braithwaite has taken the use of fast vibrato rather further than Combs did – it does take a bit of getting used to. She also studied with Walter Boeykens, and was herself a teacher for 33 years at Codarts in Rotterdam. She plays on, and also endorses, that rarity of an instrument, the Uebel Superior, a Boehm system instrument made in Germany. The recording is superb – venues include a favourite of Dutch musicians, the Westvest kerk in Schiedam – and the booklet, with all the song texts and much else included, has been carefully, thoughtfully, lovingly assembled.

Chromatic Renaissance EXAUDI Vocal Ensemble/James Weeks (Winter & Winter)

I only recently reviewed EXAUDI, an album of contemporary music utterly different from this, and this speaks to the twin comfort zones of the group, in the very new and very old. They give new music a sense of substance and permanence, while making the old sound novel, and never more so than in this album exploring music of the “chromatic Renaissance” of the mid-1500s: composers pushing the boundaries of what was possible within the pre-tonal harmonic system of the time. It is a heady and even disorientating listen, a bit like walking on a swaying ship's deck: on the one hand the chords are familiar types, but they follow each other in such unlikely progressions that it can be dizzying.

The first track is one of the most extreme: Orlando di Lasso's Timor et tremor. Within seconds we are whisked into a world or swirling harmonic uncertainty. Here it is at the service of a text expressing “psychic distress” although also widely used to represent eroticism, as in the languorous Anna mihi dilecta. There are also pieces by Cipriano de Rore, Luca Marenzio and Luzzascho Luzzaschi – of which Cipriano's bleakly beautiful O Sonno is perhaps the pick.

But the really extraordinary stuff comes in the work of two less well-known composers, Vicente Lusitano (now considered to be the earliest published Afro-descendant composer) and Nicola Vicentino, who had a famous public debate over the issue of harmonic experimentation. Although Lusitano took the traditionalist side, he also created perhaps the strangest and most avant-garde pieces on this disc, Heu me, Domine, which is made up of creeping vocal lines going up and up the chromatic scale, a degree of total chromaticism not seen again for another three-and-a-half centuries. The debating voice of adventure, Vicentino, is represented only by the fragments of his work that survive in a treatise he wrote to argue his point. His big idea was to create a microtonal scale of 31 degrees, and the resulting music – sung with pinpoint precision by EXAUDI – is haunting, utterly peculiar and frighteningly modern.

An EXAUDI album is always a must-listen, put together with impeccable scholarship and musical sensitivity, with beautiful presentation by Winter & Winter. And the singing is intoxicating – although listening to the whole thing straight through might leave you feeling dangerously squiffy. Bernard Hughes

Ellis Island – music by Bartók, Kurtág, Ligeti, Mingus, Monk and Schubert Julia Hamos (piano) (Naïve)

I'm a sucker for a well-planned recital disc and Julia Hamos's anthology ticks all the right boxes. New York's Ellis Island was where millions of US immigrants were processed between 1892 and 1954, and is an apt title for an album celebrating the pianist's Hungarian and American heritage. Hamos opens with one of György Kurtág's playful Játékok (Games), the rising and falling swoops suggesting an excited child running their fingers up and down the keyboard. The vertiginous final descent caught me unawares. Hamos adds Kurtág's early 8 Klavierstücke, fiendish but dazzling miniatures, most lasting less than a minute. She finds rapt mystery in the quieter moments (sample the tiny “Calmo”), and the faster pieces astonish, the closing “Vivo” another musical rollercoaster. She's equally impressive in the demonic “Fanfares” from Ligeti's first book of Etudes, “a dance with danger, with fire and fireworks”, its rhythm reminiscent of the last of Bartók's Six Dances in Bulgarian Rhythm from Mikrokosmos. I've not heard the fourth dance sound quite this jazzy before, and the motoric second is pushed to the limit. This is exhilarating pianism. Hamos is equally persuasive in the earlier 15 Hungarian Peasant Songs, here sounding like improvisations.

Meredith Monk's short piano piece Ellis Island was composed for her 1981 film of the same name, a repetitive but mellifluous jewel in Hamos's hands, and her transcription of Charles Mingus's Myself When I am Real is technically brilliant and wonderfully played. A pity that more contemporary American music wasn't included, the album concluding unexpectedly but deliciously with Schubert's D187 Hungarian Melody. Hamos's very personal booklet essay is an interesting read and the recording has remarkable presence.

O Sacrum Convivium: Music for the Solemnity of Corpus Christi The Choir of Buckfast Abbey/Matthew Searles (Ad Fontes)

Robert Pecksmith's sleeve note describes the Catholic Solemnity of Corpus Christi as a celebration of both past and the present. So it's fitting that the repertoire on this album from Matthew Searles' Buckfast Abbey Choir ranges from Gregorian chant to a contemporary Mass setting first performed in 2024, with individual numbers interspersed with movements from an organ work composed in the 1950s. The mixture works well: I began listening to O Sacrum Convivium on a long drive and was instantly drawn in. Spectacular engineering helps, the abbey's resonant acoustic aiding the performances rather than impeding them. The “Ante Introitum” from Anton Heiller's four-movement In festo Corporis Christi is an engaging opener. Heiller was a close friend of Hindemith, and you can hear the older composer's influence in the clean contrapuntal lines and idiosyncratic use of tonality. Note how the music ends on a unison D, which becomes the starting note for the first snatch of plainsong.

The new commission, Martin Baker's Missa O sacrum convivium!, is based around a pair of chants, the melodies occasionally quoted literally. Searles' 29 voice choir sings beautifully, the sound rich and full of impact. Organist Charles Maxtone-Smith draws some warm, mellow sonorities from the Abbey's Ruffati organ. It's followed by the Solemn Vespers and Benediction, a highlight being a brief but exquisite setting of the Lord's Prayer by Rimsky-Korsakov. The service closes with Stanfield's “Sweet Sacrament Divine”, the organ accompaniment subtly beefed up in Searles' new arrangement. Documentation is excellent, with full texts and translations, the album snazzily designed and presented as a small hardback book. Recommended.

Can you change the minds of pro-Russian conspiracy theorists? Czech director Robin Kvapil tried, driving three of them to Ukraine and filming the outcome. The resulting documentary has proved controversial.

The scene: A pine forest near Izium, a city on the Donets River in eastern Ukraine. There are empty graves all around. This is where Russian soldiers buried the hundreds of civilians they killed in the spring of 2022.

The graves are empty because the bodies in them have been exhumed for examination. Some of the people buried here were horribly tortured. Along with Bucha, a town northwest of Kyiv, this is the site of some of the most serious Russian war crimes committed in Ukraine.

Petra, one of the visitors here on this day, simply notes that the sand in the forest feels like the sand you might find on a beach, a strange feeling in this particular place. The forest is really beautiful, she adds, and the pine needles smell nice. The camera follows her as she walks around. Later, Petra says that everything here must be faked.

""This is excellent material for Ukrainian propaganda, to cultivate hatred against the Russians,"" she explains. ""It's like something out of a textbook on nationalism.""

This is an actual scene from Czech director Robin Kvapil's latest documentary, ""The Great Patriotic Trip."" Kvapil took three Czech civilians, who hold anti-Ukrainian, pro-Russian views, to Ukraine to see the reality of Russia's war. Kvapil and his team filmed the travelers, and the travelers also filmed themselves, commenting on what they saw.

The three Czech citizens are what one might call representatives of the ""anti-woke."" They're opposed to environmental politics, refugees, the European Union and any gender-related issues. They believe the war in Ukraine is all about the West opposing Russia, and they are disturbed by the Ukrainian refugees in their own country.

The documentary premiered in the Czech Republic on August 21. The choice of date was no coincidence: it's the anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.

The film has already made waves at home. Over the past weeks, most major Czech media have reported on it, and it's become the subject of intense debate on social media. Kvapil, 40, who comes from the eastern Czech city of Brno, has received both support and criticism, as well as anonymous threats against himself and his family, he told DW.

The public debate surrounding the film focuses on the strength and danger of Russian influence in the Czech Republic, whether and how divided the country is, and whether the civilian conspiracy theorists in the film are being treated unfairly or exploited.

The documentary was released at a time of particular political tension in the country. There will be parliamentary elections in early October and the right-wing, populist ANO party is a front-runner.

ANO (""yes"" in English) is the party of former prime minister and billionaire Andrej Babis, which tends toward pro-Russian policies. Two other parties that are both pro-Russian — a communist party and a far-right party — are also likely to get into parliament.

Kvapil found his three protagonists through a newspaper advertisement last September. The advertisement said, ""For a documentary, we are looking for men and women who have doubts about information coming from the mainstream media about the war in Ukraine. The film crew will give you the opportunity to find out the truth."" 

He ended up with Ivo, Nikola and Petra, all in their mid-50s. Petra, the daughter of a communist official, studied theology. Nikola is a cattle farmer, and Ivo can often be found working in his allotment garden. Ivo says he doesn't check news on the internet to see if it's true but whether it ""feels right"" to him.

Kvapil, his team and the three civilians traveled together in a minibus to the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. Along the way Petra sang the Russian national anthem.

In Kharkiv, the three civilians and the film crew see the massive destruction in the city with their own eyes: a bombed-out hospital and the Saltivka neighborhood, where everything is closed and almost completely uninhabitable thanks to Russian bombing. They visit children attending school in bunkers, speak with residents, drive to a village near the front line and then to the forest with the empty graves near Izium.

Ivo, Nikola and Petra talk about what they're seeing, and their comments range from the shocking to the abhorrent. The Russians don't mean to hit civilians or sick people, they say, reasoning that sometimes rockets miss their mark. And Nikola says that it's possible Russian soldiers sexually assaulted children because they knew they would die soon and wanted to have sex one more time. That's just how men are, he explains.

Sometimes during the film, doubts do seem to creep in. When a Ukrainian man recounts how he lost his wife, his children and all of his neighbors in the Russian bombing, Petra hugs him. 

Watching the film, one can't help but wait for the three Czech civilians to come to their senses. But on the return journey, they tell the film crew that if the purpose of the trip was to ""reeducate"" them, then it didn't work. Their opinions have not changed.

In the final scene, the director discusses this with them. ""I've learned that there's a world where evil wins, where people like Ivo, Nikola and Petra see everything but continue to spread the narrative of a monstrous regime committing genocide,"" he tells them. ""And if they win elections in the free West and weaken our system, then some of us might not be here for much longer because anybody could just kill us.""

Nikola nods. ""My friend, that's how it's going to happen,"" he replies. In the film, it's unclear how he meant that. But later, when Kvapil asks him if he is joking, Nikola says he did mean it.

In the documentary, Kvapil himself comes to a dark conclusion. ""I've learned that it's me who has to change,"" he says on camera. Trying to understand everyone and reach an agreement at any cost could be our greatest source of weakness, the reason these wars are lost. First, the information war, then the real war.""

For decades a group calling itself the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) has held a ceremony at the Mansion House in Dublin that its members call “the turning of the sovereign seal”.

During the short ritual, IRB president Billy McGuire holds up a golden harp before turning it around seven times. According to IRB lore, this must happen every year to reaffirm the sovereignty of Ireland.

The leaders of the IRB claim this organisation is no different from the secret-oath-bound society of the same name that played a key role in Irish independence a century ago.

Over the years the turning of the seal ceremony has been tolerated by city authorities as, at worst, a harmless nonsense by a group with a tenuous grasp of Irish history. Most years McGuire has been allowed to conduct the ceremony inside the Mansion House itself.

In recent years, however, a new cohort has taken over the IRB, turning it into an organisation steeped in the pseudo-legal language of the sovereign citizen movement, which believes, in basic terms, that citizens are not subject to State laws. This has caused officials in Dublin and nationally to become increasingly nervous about the group's intentions.

The leaders of the modern IRB are in large part veterans of the Covid-19 anti-mask and anti-lockdown campaigns, along with property owners who turned to the conspiracy theories after losing vast sums during the crash. Its leaders include a prominent Clare businessman, a teacher, a healthcare worker and a life coach.

[ ‘Serious concerns' over conspiracy theory group forming shadow system of county councils ]

This version of the IRB is now in the process of establishing a shadow government to run in parallel with what it calls the “corporate government” in Leinster House. It has a cabinet of ministers (which it calls secretaries), a nascent court system and a network of local government bodies. It has also adopted a new time zone, called Irish Rising Time, which is 25 minutes slower and based on the time zone used in Dublin until the 1916 rising.

It even claims control over Óglaigh na hÉireann, the official Irish name of the Defence Forces. Some members have been appointed “generals”, and the organisation flies the flags of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps at its ceremonies. The IRB's leaders have registered themselves, through the Companies Registration Office, as the official owners of the Óglaigh na hÉireann title. A spokesman for the Department of Defence declined to comment except to say that since last year it is an offence to use the term Óglaigh na hÉireann “other than where such use is authorised by law”.

In spite of its military aspirations, the IRB does not claim to be an armed group. In a 2023 meeting of its “supreme council”, members agreed there was no need for the “spilling of blood”. Instead, according to the minutes, it was agreed that the IRB's struggle against the Government would be a “paper war”.

The original Irish Republican Brotherhood was a secret, oath-bound society whose members included many of the leaders of the Irish independence movement in the early 20th century, including Patrick Pearse and Michael Collins. It played a key behind-the-scenes role in the struggle for independence before, according to all credible histories, officially disbanding in 1924, two years after it split over the Anglo-Irish Treaty. 

According to the version of history adopted by members of the modern IRB, the organisation persisted under the leadership of a man called Tom McGuire, who conducted the first turning-of-the-seal ceremony in 1919. The story goes that in the early 1950s, McGuire transferred the IRB presidency to his seven-year-old grandnephew Billy McGuire, who has held the position since.

This version of events has left some historians scratching their heads. “If there was a Tom McGuire around in 1919, he was nobody important,” says historian Owen McGee, author of The IRB: the Irish Republican Brotherhood, from the Land League to Sinn Féin.

The turning of the seal “means nothing and has nothing to do with anything historical”, he says. The only possible exception was an effort by Éamon de Valera during the Civil War to obtain the seal used by the first Dáil to stamp documents. But this was an actual seal, rather than the harp used by the modern IRB. The real IRB, being a secret society, did not have a seal, says McGee.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, McGuire encountered John Flanagan, a Co Clare businessman who operated a chain of hotels in the west before the financial crash. Flanagan claims to have been before the courts more than any person in Ireland, often representing himself and employing sovereign citizen legal strategies.

Flanagan's many civil hearings include a case taken in 2017 by his company Diamrem Ltd against Clare County Council. Diamrem is seeking €15 million in damages from the council for opening a car park at the Cliffs of Moher, which it claims scuppered its nearby private car park. 

With McGuire's blessing, Flanagan took over as chairman of the IRB's supreme council in February 2022. He also became the secretary for finance and defence and “commander in chief” of the military. Other figures who had been prominent in opposing the government's Covid-19 measures followed. Former UCD professor Dolores Cahill, who claimed children who wore face masks would have lower IQ, was appointed as “chief justice” (she was later ousted from the role and replaced by a builder from Mayo).

HSE physiotherapist Anna Marie Stack Rivas, who was subject to a fitness-to-practise inquiry after speaking out against Covid-19 vaccines, became secretary for public health. Barra de Róiste, a primary schoolteacher who refused to enforce mask rules in class, was appointed education secretary.

Howard Hughes, a “life and executive coach” was put in charge of foreign affairs, making him responsible for forging links with sovereign citizen movements around the world, including in the UK, New Zealand and Hawaii. 

The supreme council declared it was taking over authority of the government in 2022 but it was last year that its “paper war” began in earnest. Confused civil servants and court officials began receiving a deluge of documents adorned with the ornate wax seals of the IRB. These letters made grand claims such as the abolition of the Act of Union, the Ministers and Secretaries Act and the Unlawful Organisation (Suppression) Order, 1939, which outlawed the IRA.

Also repealed, according to the IRB, was Laudabiliter, a papal bull said to have been issued by Pope Adrian IV in 1155 permitting the Norman invasion of Ireland. 

The documents use the impenetrable language of the sovereign citizen movement, making it hard to determine what they actually mean. Civil servants, unsure of how to respond to these declarations, generally just ignored them. This allowed the IRB to claim their declarations had been uncontested by the “corporate government”.

The group also went about setting up a network of “co-ops” and councils around the country, which would become their version of local government. The first was established in Finglas, Dublin. The IRB claims it has established more than 30 bodies in seven counties, with particularly strong representation in Donegal and Galway.

Documents were then issued to the genuine local councils, informing them that all decisions must first be referred to their IRB counterparts.

Co-op members also started recruiting in their local areas. They claimed significant success. Flanagan told one meeting that 150 people had been recruited to the Crossmolina co-op in Co Mayo. Another member claimed to have recruited 297 people by canvassing just two housing estates in Finglas.

Efforts began to set up a network of community and county courts around the country, with locals being asked to take up the role of judges. The extent of this network is not clear, although Flanagan claims one case was held before a jury in Kilfenora, Co Clare, in 2022 which resulted in the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 being struck down.

In response to queries, the Department of Justice warned that any summons issued by these IRB courts “are invalid and without lawful authority”.

Most of the IRB's activity has gone unnoticed or has been ignored by officials. Several local authorities responded to queries that they have never heard of the IRB. However, in Galway, two meetings of the Oughterard co-op were attended by Independent Ireland councillor Noel Thomas, according to minutes of the meetings.

Thomas was a Fianna Fáil councillor until 2024 when he resigned after facing disciplinary action for saying the “inn is full” in reference to immigration. He made the comments in the context of an arson attack on a hotel earmarked for asylum seekers. Thomas's home was searched by gardaí investigating the arson but he was never accused of an offence.

According to the minutes from an IRB co-op meeting in June, Thomas “delivered a passionate speech highlighting the illusion of democracy” and expressed support for the co-ops “as real democratic alternatives”.

He confirmed this week he attended the meetings. He said he knew little about the IRB but described the concept of the co-op as “wonderful”.

Other councillors in Galway began expressing concern these groups may be misleading locals into believing they are legitimate public representatives. According to a report in July in the Connacht Tribune, Independent councillor Thomas Welby said the IRB was “peddling mistruths” and that “there were young people going around Oughterard wrongly claiming people don't have to pay their car tax or insurance”. 

A spokeswoman for Galway County Council said it was aware of these councils and that at a meeting in June, “elected members expressed concern regarding the potential confusion these groups may cause to the public by presenting themselves as representative bodies.

“The council wishes to reaffirm that it is the only democratically elected local authority for Co Galway, with statutory responsibilities and accountability to the public.”

Mary Hanna Hourigan, president of the Association of Irish Local Government, says her organisation is aware “of groups purporting to set up so-called “community councils” or “co-ops” in a number of counties.

“We have very serious concerns about any group which seeks to position itself as a substitute for local government or the courts system without any democratic mandate, legal standing or accountability,” says Hourigan, a Fine Gael councillor in Tipperary. “Such actions risk misleading or exploiting citizens and undermining confidence in the institutions of the State.” 

She urged the public to be cautious about engaging with groups that claim to be representative bodies “without any basis in law or legitimacy through the democratic process.”

The IRB has also been active in setting up its own versions of more mundane State functions. For example, members can now apply for an IRB-issued “travel card”, its version of a driving licence.

In August 2023 Flanagan produced one of these cards when he was pulled over by gardaí while driving his 2022 BMW X5 at 155km per hour on the motorway. After learning the car had never been taxed, gardaí seized the BMW, leading Flanagan to lodge a case in the High Court.

He employed various sovereign-citizen legal devices, telling the court he was not a person under the law but a “sovereign living man, ever present from fertilisation until last breath”.

The judge found against Flanagan, accusing him of employing a “a pseudo-legal nonsense without any effect and done for reasons which are at best confused and at worst malign”.

Recently, much of the IRB's efforts have gone into setting up its own property registration service. According to its website, users pay €25 a year to register a profile and another €500 to “proclaim equitable, beneficial and allodial interests in land and dwellings”. 

Hughes, the secretary for foreign affairs, has said publicly that the IRB has also hired Flanagan's company TMHL Consultancy “for administration services” and to run the property registration site. He said profits “go towards further employment and the advancement of these services”. 

The group has faced criticism for its approach towards finances. Last year, during an appearance on an Irish far-right podcast, Flanagan faced questions over why the IRB was charging €22 a head for “deeds of acknowledgment and confirmation”. Flanagan said the charge was to “cover costs”.

Flanagan denied that the IRB local councils and co-ops were trying to replace the legitimate councils. Instead they were there ‘to assist public representatives'

Flanagan agreed to an interview but said he was unavailable this week. Instead he responded to a list of questions from The Irish Times. He said the current IRB was the continuation of the historic organisation after “a faction” continued on its operations in 1924.

He confirmed the IRB claims “authority” for the people of Ireland. That authority had been transferred to Dáil Éireann in 1919 but reverted back to the IRB following a decision of its “supreme council” in 2022, he said.

Regarding its court system, he said it was expected that every county would have its own court by 2030. The decisions of these courts would be referred to An Garda Síochána for enforcement, he said.

Flanagan denied that the IRB local councils and co-ops were trying to replace the legitimate councils. Instead they were there “to assist public representatives”, he said.

He said there were 2,000-3,000 people involved in the IRB's local councils. He said more than 1,000 had signed up for the property registration service and more than 1,500 had sought IRB deeds of citizenship. These figures could not be independently confirmed.

The IRB also did not claim to control the “corporate” Defence Forces, Flanagan said. Rather, it was referring to the version of Óglaigh na hÉireann established in 1913.

Regarding fees, Flanagan said TMHL did not receive any income from the IRB and that earlier this month a decision was taken to replace the €500 property registration fee with an optional donation to “a community of their choice”.

The tactics of the IRB mirror those of the provisional government during the War of Independence, when it established its own institutions and courts to undermine those of the British crown. However, unlike the insurgents, the modern IRB enjoys no electoral mandate or broad support. With its ill-defined ideology and bizarre legal theories, that position seems unlikely to change significantly in the near future.

As the core group grows ... the likelihood of violence becomes greater

So, given that its main political achievement to date is annoying civil servants, why should anyone be concerned?

According to Dr Kevin Sweeney, a criminologist in UCC who studies the effects of disinformation on democratic institutions, the danger is that groups like the IRB can slowly erode trust in State institutions. 

The organs of the State only work because people believe and agree they are legitimate, says Sweeney, who spent 27 years as a garda, including in the Special Detective Unit. Once that agreement is withdrawn, things fall apart.

Sovereign citizen movements offer easy answers to complex questions, he says, and it is often vulnerable people who suffer. Such groups first became popular in the United States where they evolved from pro-gun and anti-tax militia movements, he says.

Their basic tenets include that citizens do not have to pay taxes or appear in court unless they have entered a “contract” to do so and that government authority “is defective or limited,” states Sweeney. Adherents often employ these “pseudo-laws” to claim they do not have to repay debts or obey road traffic laws.

These types of arguments have been repeatedly and emphatically rejected in the Irish courts, yet people continue to rely on them, sometimes resulting in large legal bills or even jail terms for contempt. “When these false beliefs hit reality, it's never a pretty sight,” says Sweeney.

Most sovereign citizens are not violent, he says, and there is no evidence the IRB has violent intentions. 

Flanagan says violence is “repugnant” to the group's objectives. 

However, in other countries sovereign citizen movements have been responsible for attacks on government institutions and the murder of police officers.

Last year, nine members of the Reichsbürger movement, a German sovereign citizen group, went on trial accused of attempting to orchestrate a coup against the Berlin government.

“Only a tiny per cent of those with radical views become extremists and take radical action,” Sweeney says, “But as the core group grows ... the likelihood of violence becomes greater.

“Once you accept the conspiracy theory worldview is correct, you're a very short distance away from taking active measures,” he says.

Salvadorian refused offer of deportation to Costa Rica before he was released to await trial on human smuggling charges

US immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Ábrego García to Uganda, after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, according to a Saturday court filing.

The Costa Rica offer came late on Thursday, after it was clear that the Salvadorian national would probably be released from a Tennessee jail the following day.

Ábrego declined to extend his stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with his family. Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

According to official documents posted online, the DHS told Ábrego's attorneys on Friday afternoon that the “DHS may remove your client … to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends)”.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement also directed Ábrego to report to its Baltimore office on Monday, according to records posted online.

Ábrego entered the US without permission in about 2011 as a teenager after fleeing gang violence. He was subsequently afforded a federal protection order against deportation to El Salvador.

The 30-year-old was initially deported by federal immigration officials in March. Though the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego's deportation was an “administrative error”, officials have repeatedly accused him of being affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim Ábrego and his family vehemently deny.

During his detention at El Salvador's so-called Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), Ábrego was physically and psychologically tortured, according to court documents filed by his lawyers in July.

Following Ábrego's wrongful deportation, the Trump administration faced widespread pressure to return him to the US, including from a supreme court order that directed federal officials to “facilitate” his return.

In June, the Trump administration returned Ábrego from El Salvador, only to charge him with crimes related to human smuggling, which his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”. His criminal trial is expected to begin in January.

Before his deportation, Ábrego had lived in Maryland for more than a decade, working in construction while being married to an American wife.

Although Ábrego was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. Those fears were somewhat allayed by a recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland, which requires immigration officials to allow Ábrego time to mount a defense.

Separately, in a statement earlier this week, Uganda said that it agreed to a “temporary agreement” with the US to accept some asylum seekers who are deported from the country.

Bagiire Vincent Waiswa, permanent secretary of Uganda's foreign ministry, said: “The agreement is in respect of third country nationals who may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin.”

Waiswa added: “This is a temporary arrangement with conditions including that individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted. Uganda also prefers that individuals from African countries shall be the ones transferred to Uganda. The two parties are working out the detailed modalities on how the agreement shall be implemented.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A late-night blaze affected trackside cables in western Germany, and police are investigating possible arson. The case has drawn attention after earlier attacks on rail infrastructure in North Rhine-Westphalia. 

A suspicious fire broke out late on Friday at railway tracks in the western city of Wuppertal, according to German rail operator Deutsche Bahn.

Cables were apparently cut and set alight deliberately, with state security investigators called to the scene to investigate after previous deliberate attacks in the same region.

A Deutsche Bahn (DB) spokeswoman told the dpa news agency that the fire appeared to have been fueled by an accelerant. Initial findings indicated cable sheathing had been set on fire near railway switches, the mechanisms that let a train move from one track to another.

Police described it as a ""switch fire"" large enough to have been noticed by a nearby resident, who informed authorities shortly before midnight.

Firefighters were able to extinguish the fire quickly, the website of local broadcaster Radio Wuppertal said.

While the flames affected three switches, the DB spokeswoman said the fire had not touched the switches directly. The spokeswoman confirmed two cables were severed ""presumably deliberately” before being set on fire.

InfraGO, a DB subsidiary, reported on its website that cables were ""damaged and ignited by third parties.""

Despite the damage, DB said train traffic was barely disrupted.

Federal police deployed state security investigators, who routinely step in when sabotage is suspected, once ordinary technical causes were ruled out. A police helicopter searched the area overnight for possible suspects, but authorities did not report any immediate arrests.

Investigators were collecting evidence from the site for forensic analysis.

Police have not publicly commented on possible motives. The incident is being treated as suspected arson against critical infrastructure.

The fire is the latest in a series of incidents targeting railway equipment in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Less than a month ago, incendiary devices were planted on a line between the cities of Düsseldorf and Duisburg. Those attacks destroyed cables controlling switches and signals and caused significant disruption to both regional and long-distance services.

Investigators are under pressure to determine whether the cases are linked amid concerns about security of transport infrastructure across the country.

Ranil Wickremesinghe, who faces charges of using public funds for private travel, treated for acute dehydration

Sri Lanka's former president was admitted to hospital on Saturday, a day after he was charged with using public funds to finance private international travel, as the government intensified its crackdown on corruption.

Ranil Wickremesinghe, 76, was remanded in custody on Friday after being accused of using taxpayers' money to pay for a two-day visit to the UK in September 2023 to attend a ceremony at the University of Wolverhampton granting an honorary professorship to his wife.

Wickremesinghe has denied the misuse of state money, and said his wife paid her own travel expenses. The visit took place upon Wickremesinghe's return from the G77 summit in Havana and the UN general assembly in New York.

The offences carry a maximum punishment of 20 years in jail and an estimated fine of 16.6m rupees (£41,000).

Wickremesinghe, who lost Sri Lanka's last presidential election in September to the leftist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, was said to be in stable condition after being brought to Colombo National hospital. The hospital's deputy head, Rukshan Bellana, told the Agence France-Presse news agency that he had to be treated for acute dehydration. “He was a severe diabetic with high blood pressure when he was brought in,” Bellana said.

Wickremesinghe became president in July 2022 after Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation following months of protests driven by the country's worst economic downturn since independence. Before assuming the presidency, Wickremesinghe, unpopular with protesters as he was seen as an ally of the Rajapaksa clan, had been prime minister six times since entering politics in 1977, though he never completed a term.

In a significant political shift for the country last September, Wickremesinghe was replaced by Dissanayake, the head of the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party. The JVP has been tarred by its past involvement in some of the worst violence in the country's history, and Dissanayake had sought to soften some of his party's more hardline positions while attracting voters with promises to tackle corruption and abuses of power.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The government does not rule out advanced nuclear energy generation if it meets the government's three prerequisites, President William Lai (賴清德) said last night after the number of votes in favor of restarting a nuclear power plant outnumbered the “no” votes in a referendum yesterday.

The referendum failed to pass, despite getting more “yes” votes, as the Referendum Act (公民投票法) states that the vote would only pass if the votes in favor account for more than one-fourth of the total number of eligible voters and outnumber the opposing votes.

Yesterday's referendum question was: “Do you agree that the Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant should continue operations upon approval by the competent authority and confirmation that there are no safety concerns?”

More than 4.34 million people voted “yes” to the restarting of the power plant, while more than 1.51 million chose “no.” The voter turnout was 29.53 percent. 

Lai said the government respects the referendum result and would continue to prioritize nuclear safety in its energy policy.

Lai added he understood ""the society's expectations for diverse energy options.""



""The greatest consensus of Taiwan's energy debate ... is safety. Nuclear safety is a scientific issue, and one that cannot be resolved through a single  vote,"" he said.

Restarting nuclear plants could not be considered without the Nuclear Safety Council establishing rules for nuclear safety review and Taiwan Power Co (Taipower, 台電) conducting a safety review in accordance with the rules, he said.

Lai said he asked the council to propose nuclear safety review rules for Taipower to conduct safety inspections on its nuclear power generating units.

The council should formulate the rules as soon as possible and Taipower should begin nuclear safety inspections after the rules are promulgated, Lai said, adding that information on the progress and potential risks would be disclosed to the public.

“If safety requirements are met, the proposal [of restarting nuclear plants] could next be sent to the council for review,” he said.

The government would continue to address nuclear issues based on three principles: nuclear safety, nuclear waste solutions and societal consensus, Lai said.

“If nuclear technology becomes safer, with less nuclear waste produced and greater social acceptance, we would not preclude such advanced nuclear technology,” he said, adding that the government was responsible for ensuring a stable power supply for the public.

Taiwan People's Party Chairman Huang Kuo-chang (黃國昌), whose party proposed the referendum, at a separate news conference last night expressed thanks to the more than 4 million voters who voted “yes” to restarting the Ma-anshan power plant.

“That marked a new start point in the history of Taiwan's energy transition and showed that the Democratic Progressive Party should review its wrong energy policy,” he said.

Although the “yes” votes did not reach the 25 percent threshold, the agreeing votes outnumbered the “no” votes nearly threefold, indicating that the government should step up the energy transition by correcting its energy policy, Huang said.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs should allow Taipower to apply for restarting nuclear power plants, based on Article 6 of the Nuclear Reactor Facilities Control Act (核子反應器設施管制法), he said.

“Yes” votes exceeded “no” votes even in Pingtung County, where the Ma-anshan power plant is located, showing that the locals are willing to restart the plant for a stable power supply, Huang added.

Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) yesterday said that the referendum result was a triumph for the public's voice over the authorities' arrogance. 

He also called on the Lai administration to refrain from political infighting and prioritize people's livelihoods.

Chu proposed five reform initiatives on behalf of the KMT — providing relief packages in response to increased US tariffs, bolstering energy security, enhancing judicial independence, respecting the legislature's power of oversight and to stop tearing apart society.

A federal judge has put a stop to further expansion of the immigration detention centre built in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” ordering that its operations wind down within two months.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in Miami wrote in her 82-page order late Thursday that Florida officials never sufficiently explained why an immigration detention centre needed to be located in the middle of sensitive wetlands cherished by environmentalists and outdoors people.

She also said that state and federal authorities never undertook an environmental review as required by federal law before Florida officials hastily built the detention camp which they championed as a model for U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration policies. That failure adversely affected the “recreational, conservational, and aesthetic interests” of the environmental groups and Miccosukee Tribe which brought the lawsuit, she said.

Republican Governor Ron DeSantis on Friday reacted to the ruling, saying he would not be deterred by “an activist judge.”

“We knew this would be something that would likely happen,” DeSantis said at a news conference in Panama City. “We will respond accordingly. You either have a country or you don't.”

Here's what to know about the situation and what might come next:

A federal judge has put a stop to further expansion of the immigration detention centre built in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,"" ordering that its operations wind down within two months.

The Associated Press

Williams said she expected the population at the facility to drop within 60 days by transferring detainees to other facilities. Once that happens, fencing, lighting, gas, waste, generators and other equipment should be removed from the site. No additional detainees can be sent to the facility, and no more additional lighting, fencing, paving, buildings or tents can be added to the camp. The only repairs that can be made to the existing facility are for safety purposes. However, the judge allowed for the existing dormitories and housing to stay in place as long as they are maintained to prevent deterioration or damage.

During court hearings, lawyers said at one point there were fewer than 1,000 detainees at the facility, which state officials had planned to hold up to 3,000 people. Although the detainees could be sent to other facilities out of state, Florida has other immigration detention centres including the Krome North Processing Center in Miami, the Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach and the Baker County Detention Center managed by the local sheriff's office. Earlier this month, DeSantis announced plans for a second state-initiated immigration detention facility dubbed “Deportation Depot” at a state prison about 69 kilometres west of downtown Jacksonville. State officials say it is expected to hold 1,300 immigration detention beds, though that capacity could be expanded to 2,000 beds.

U.S. detainees describe worm-filled food, inhuman treatment at ‘Alligator Alcatraz' migrant centre

Civil rights lawyers had filed a second lawsuit over practices at “Alligator Alcatraz,” claiming that detainees weren't able to meet with their attorneys privately and were denied access to immigration courts. Another federal judge in Miami dismissed part of the lawsuit earlier this week after the Trump administration designated the Krome North Processing Center as the court for their cases to be heard. The judge moved the remaining counts of the case from Florida's southern district to the middle district. Eunice Cho, the lead attorney for the detainees, said Friday that the decision in the environmental lawsuit won't have an impact on the civil rights case since there could be detainees at the facility for the next two months.

“Our case addresses the lack of access to counsel for people detained at Alligator Alcatraz, and there are still people detained there,” Cho said.

Documented or not, immigrants in the U.S. fear they'll be swept up in Trump's mass deportation crackdown

No one has said publicly what will happen to the hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts involved in the facility. DeSantis' administration in July signed contracts with private vendors to pay at least US$245-million to set up and run the centre, according to a public database. That amount – to be fronted by Florida taxpayers – was in line with the US$450-million a year officials have estimated the facility was going to cost. The governor's office and the Florida Division of Emergency Management on Friday didn't respond to questions about whether Florida taxpayers would still be on the hook for the contracts if the facility is shuttered.

No. This case will continue to be litigated. The state of Florida filed a notice of appeal Thursday night, shortly after the ruling was issued. As its name suggests, a preliminary injunction is only an initial action taken by a judge to prevent harm while a lawsuit makes its way through the court process and when it appears that one side has a good chance of succeeding based on the merits of the case.

			Ghislaine Maxwell claims that it was Lady de Rothschild who introduced the two men to each other in the early 2000s

Ghislaine Maxwell has denied introducing Prince Andrew to Jeffrey Epstein and said they met for the first time at the holiday home of a British-American philanthropist.

The Duke of York's personal relationship with Epstein became a major factor in his stepping down from royal duties amid the scandal around the disgraced paedophile financier.

Maxwell's claim emerged in transcripts of her Department of Justice interviews, which were released on Friday afternoon by the Trump administration.

“First of all, let's just state, I did not introduce him [Epstein] to Prince Andrew. I did not introduce him to Prince Andrew or to Sarah Ferguson. That is a flat untruth. I'll start with that,” Maxwell said over nine hours of interviews over two days in July.

Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for recruiting underage girls for Epstein, claimed one of his clients, Lynn Forester de Rothschild, introduced the men in Martha's Vineyard in the early 2000s.

Lady de Rothschild, a New Jersey-born telecoms businesswoman turned investor, chairs EL Rothschild, a wealth management firm which has The Economist Group in its portfolio.

A donor to both Bill and Hillary Clinton's political campaigns, Lady de Rothschild founded the not for profit Council for Inclusive Capitalism.

King Charles, then the Prince of Wales, spoke at Lady de Rothschild's 2014 Conference of Inclusive Capitalism in London.

“She had a house or she rented a house in the Vineyard. I think it was in the Vineyard or Nantucket, I can't remember now which one it was,” Maxwell told Todd Blanche, deputy attorney-general and a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump.

“It was one of those. It was either in Nantucket or the Vineyard, and invited Epstein to go, and I believe that's when he met Prince Andrew.”

Organisations associated with Lady de Rothschild, 71, have been approached for comment.

Her spokesman has previously firmly denied claims that Epstein gave her financial help after a divorce from politician Andrew Stein.

“One hundred percent false,” the spokesman told Vanity Fair in 2019.

Lady de Rothschild's third marriage was to British financier and philanthropist Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, a scion of the famous banking family, who died in 2022, aged 91.

She was introduced to Sir Evelyn by Henry Kissinger at the Bilderberg Conference in Turnberry, Scotland in 1998.

The transcripts were released by the Trump administration in a push to dampen criticism over a failure to release evidence about Epstein.

He died in prison in 2019 awaiting trial for sex trafficking under-age girls.

Maxwell, a former socialite, said she never would have thought to introduce Prince Andrew and Epstein because they were like “two chalk and cheeses”.

She also claimed that Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrew's now ex-wife, tried to “put the moves” on Epstein.

“I thought that Sarah was trying to put the moves on Jeffrey, if I'm being honest, and I thought the whole thing was annoying and I was p----d off.”

“I think Sarah is the one that pushed that. And they met and hung out, I want to say two or three times that had nothing to do with me,” she said.

She added: “I wasn't communicating with Andrew, I wasn't in touch with him. And I know this because I was annoyed and I felt left out, and I felt disrespected and I was like, this is weird. I couldn't even imagine Epstein and Andrew together.”

Thousands of rank-and-file workers have joined the union to fight the billionaire media moguls taking over the industry.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

This story was originally published by Labor Notes.

The news industry has undergone a sea-change in the last two decades. Print readership of newspapers has declined sharply, while their digital readership has edged up slowly. Local newspapers have consolidated into ever larger chains controlled by private equity and vulture funds. Newer digital-only media sites have multiplied.

Into this changing news landscape has come an influx of new journalists who bridle at the poor working conditions and low pay inflicted by media moguls building their empires on the cheap. Thousands of these media workers are finding a home in the NewsGuild.

The Guild has transformed itself in recent years, thanks to rising rank-and-file militancy and innovative organizing tactics. Since 2020, the Guild has organized 210 workplaces, including some of the largest media organizations in the U.S. That includes 600 tech workers at the New York Times (the largest unionized tech unit in the country), 226 workers at Politico, and 180 workers at The Atlantic magazine, as well as smaller operations like 20 workers at the Anchorage Daily News.

The Guild is a sector of the Communications Workers, which also represents workers in telecommunications, airlines, the public sector, and manufacturing. Since 2020, the Guild has grown faster than any other CWA sector or district, organizing more than 8,500 workers. Today the Guild represents 25,800 workers in 519 workplaces in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The Guild also has 6,000 members in Canada.

In the past five years, the Guild has conducted 95 strikes, many of them short and almost all successful (although a difficult strike at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette passed the 1,000-day mark in July). Many of these strikes were part of fights to win first contracts. Since January 2024 alone, the Guild has negotiated 62 first-time contracts. The Guild also represents an increasing number of staff workers at non-profits and unions.

At the heart of the Guild's winning strategy is member-driven organizing. The union is enlisting rank-and-file members who have successfully organized their own union to help workers at other sites get organized. Some of these workers are volunteers, while others are paid by the Guild for a few hours a week. The strategy partly evolved out of necessity, as the organizing opportunities popping up across the country outpaced the capacity of the Guild's small full-time staff.

With member-to-member organizing, says Jon Schleuss, the Guild's international president, workers looking to unionize “get to learn from another rank-and-file worker who just won an election themselves, and that's a powerful experience. And then it replicates itself and you win again — and then you get more member organizers.”

Schleuss joined the Guild as a digital news journalist at the Los Angeles Times, after helping lead a successful drive to unionize the newsroom in 2015. He was elected president of the NewsGuild in 2019 at just 32 years old. The member-organizer strategy has flourished under his watch.

Stephanie Basile, a Guild staffer who leads the member-organizing effort, says the basic idea is to “democratize and demystify the organizing process. We believe these are skills that can be taught and shared far and wide.”

In training sessions, member-organizers help each other figure out the next step in their campaign. “We have this philosophy of ‘learn, do, teach' to train other members to take on the tasks and share the work,” Basile says.

Down in the newsroom trenches, the Guild's member-organizers sense the power of this rank-and-file approach.

“Organizing can be hard — it can be exhausting,” says Megan Gray, arts and culture reporter at the Portland Press Herald and president of The News Guild of Maine. The Maine member-organizers' monthly meetings are “sort of group therapy for organizers,” she says.

By sharing experiences, organizers come up with new ways to solve problems and hear practical advice on building solidarity. The News Guild of Maine's culture of organizing began taking root in 2022 after journalists at the Bangor Daily News reached out to the union, and, with the help of Guild member-organizers, won representation.

The union's member-driven organizing has also fostered a rank-and-file approach to bargaining.

Danielle Newsome, NewsGuild's director of collective bargaining, said that leadership decided that the union needed to train more members to support bargaining in both their own shops and other shops.

“The people who know the issues the best, who are used to dealing with management every day, should take the lead at the bargaining table,” Newsome said.

The Guild's grassroots militancy has been fueled in part by large Guild attendance at Labor Notes conferences, held every two years in Chicago. At each of the last two conferences, the Guild sent more than 100 members. It hopes to send even more next year. “We go to the trainings, we meet other rank-and-file members, and we take things back and incorporate them into our training,” says Schleuss.

One strategy the union picked up from Labor Notes and other unions, he says, is open bargaining, where the union insists that members be allowed to sit in on bargaining sessions with the company. When members see bosses taking hardline, inflexible stances, militancy grows.

The Guild has shown that it is ready to walk off the job when necessary. Hundreds of workers walked the picket lines at the New York Times last fall during an eight-day strike by tech workers. The walkout, which was organized with support from member-organizers, took place during the week of the presidential election — a moment when the union felt it had its greatest leverage. The Times was unable to publish a lot of the special features it had planned for the election, says Kathy Zhang, unit chair of the Times Tech Guild.

Zhang said that the union assigned three member-organizers to support the Tech Guild's fight. The biggest issue leading up to the strike was the Times' refusal to include a “just-cause” clause in the contract. The company had a history of firing workers without explanation, a practice that would be barred under the clause. A month after the strike, the union announced it had reached an agreement that included just-cause protections.

The Guild's organizing strategy has caught the attention of Eric Blanc, professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. His new book, We Are the Union: How Worker-to-Worker Organizing Is Revitalizing Labor and Winning Big, highlights the Guild's model.

“I think the NewsGuild has the best and most promising model of organizing in the country,” Blanc said in an interview. “I think every union in the country should be moving in the direction of the Guild, because what the Guild is doing is training up its worker-leaders to take on the responsibilities that often unions assume can only be done by staff.”

“By giving more responsibility to workers for systematic training, the Guild is developing a program that can scale up,” said Blanc. “If we are going to organize tens of millions of workers, most unions will need to do what the NewsGuild is doing — which is to give more leadership and responsibility to worker-leaders.”

            Even before he emerged from the bullpen Friday, the Pittsburgh Pirates' Bubba Chandler was considered the top pitching prospect in baseball.
    


            And the hard-throwing 22-year-old confirmed those credentials in his major league debut, becoming the first pitcher to throw four scoreless innings and record a save in his debut since saves became an officially recognized statistic in 1969, according to AP.
    


            He allowed just two hits and struck out three in those four innings, needing 40 pitches to get the 12 outs and clinch a 9-0 win for the Pirates against the Colorado Rockies.
    


            Although he gave up a double to the first batter he faced, Orlando Arcia, he rallied and struck out Ryan Ritter and Mickey Moniak, while Tyler Freeman ground out, stranding Arcia.
    


            Chandler's decisive pitches to Ritter and Moniak clocked in at 99.9 mph and 100.4 mph, respectively – the fastest pitches for strikeouts that any Pirate has thrown this year.
    


            “Welcome to the show, huh,” Chandler said afterward, recalling Arcia's double. “Thought I made a good pitch but he hit it pretty hard. Kind of a scare, you don't want to give up a homer on your first at-bat but it was pretty sweet. After that at-bat, my emotions kind of slowed down and it was great.”
    


            Despite being just 22 years old, Chandler's impressive performances at Triple-A Indianapolis made him “mad” that he hadn't been called up already.
    


            “In the end, I'm here in the big leagues,” he told reporters afterward, per MLB. “There's not a lot of 22-year-old kids that get to do this. I'm grateful. I was mad, yeah, whatever. But at the same time I didn't need to take care of what I needed to take care of, so that falls back on me. Now I'm here. Don't care.”
    


            “Stress, I guess stress is a big thing. I've never really been a stressed-out guy, but I have been the past couple months just trying to get here.”
    


            Chandler's emergence further strengthens the Pirates' pitching staff, which also includes last year's NL Rookie of the Year Paul Skenes.
    


            Elsewhere, the San Diego Padres defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 2-1 to tie with their rivals at the top of the NL West. Yu Darvish allowed just one hit across six innings and combined with three relievers to dominate the Dodgers.
    


            Meanwhile, the Boston Red Sox took a 1-0 victory against the New York Yankees behind Brayan Bello's seven scoreless innings, securing the season series over their rivals.

            Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp resigned Friday evening, after he failed to secure new sanctions against Israel over the war in Gaza.
    


            Veldkamp had informed the country's parliament he intended to bring in new measures in response to Israel's planned offensive in Gaza City and other heavily populated areas but was unable to secure the support of his coalition partners.
    


            The 61-year-old former ambassador to Israel told reporters he felt he was unable “to implement policy myself and chart the course I deem necessary.”
    


            Following Veldkamp's resignation, the remaining Cabinet members of his center-right New Social Contract party also quit, leaving the Dutch government in disarray.
    


            “In short we are done with it,” party leader Eddy Van Hijum said, calling the Israeli government's actions “diametrically opposed to international treaties.”
    


            The Dutch government already collapsed in June when anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders pulled out of the country's four-party coalition over a fight about immigration.
    


            The three remaining parties stayed on in a caretaker government until elections could be held in October.
    


            The world's leading authority on food crises said earlier on Friday the Gaza Strip's largest city is gripped by famine, and that it's likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.
    


            The Netherlands' Parliament had repeatedly delayed a debate on sanctions against Israel, a discussion that was already postponed from Thursday, as the Friday afternoon Cabinet meeting dragged on.
    


            “There's a famine, ethnic cleansing, and genocide going on,” Kati Piri of the merged Green Left/Labor parties told Parliament, “And our cabinet has been deliberating for hours about whether to take any action at all. Shameful.”
    


            Veldkamp had proposed a ban on imports from Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories in response to the planned military escalation.
    


            Opposition politicians had called for a no-confidence vote for the minister, frustrated at what they saw as a lack of action against Israel.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from jail in Tennessee on Friday so he can rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, his defense attorneys told a court Saturday.

The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday and included a requirement that he remain in jail, according to a brief filed in Tennessee, where the criminal case was brought. After Abrego Garcia left jail on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

Later on Friday, “the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning — precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office — to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,” his defense attorneys wrote.

They declined to say whether he is still considering the offer.

Filed along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face the possibility of detention. An additional benefit of the offer would be that Costa Rica is a Spanish-speaking country, like Abrego Garcia's native El Salvador. Abrego Garcia would only be deported to Costa Rica after serving his sentence on the smuggling charges, according to the brief.

Abrego Garcia's case became a flash point in President Donald Trump's immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a judge's earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He has pleaded not guilty and has asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.




“Despite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego's counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office Monday morning,” the brief says, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning. 

A Department of Homeland Security agent later testified that he didn't begin investigating the traffic stop until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. 

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours' notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision. 

“Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's lead attorney in the Maryland lawsuit against the Trump administration, said Saturday that the government is trying to use the immigration system to punish his client. 

“There is a perfectly reasonable option available, Costa Rica, where he his family can visit him easily, but instead they are attempting to send him halfway across the world, to a country with documented human rights abuses and where he does not even speak the language,” he said in a statement.

The searches were part of an investigation into the handling of classified documents, a person familiar with the matter said Friday.

A person familiar with the matter says the FBI is searching the Maryland home of John Bolton, who served in President Donald Trump's first administration as national security adviser but later became critical of the president.

President Donald Trump continues to maintain he didn't “know anything about” the FBI's search of John Bolton's home or office Friday, telling reporters his own Mar-a-Lago estate was raided, too, so he knows the feeling and “it's not a good feeling.”

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI on Friday searched the Maryland home and Washington office of former Trump administration national security adviser John Bolton as part of a criminal investigation into the potential mishandling of classified information, a person familiar with the matter said.

Bolton, who emerged as an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump after being fired in 2019 and fought with the first Trump administration over a scathing book he wrote documenting his time in the White House, was not in custody Friday and has not been charged with any crimes, said the person who was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. 

The searches, seemingly the most significant public step the Justice Department has taken against a perceived enemy of the president, are likely to elicit fresh concerns that the Trump administration is using its law enforcement powers to target the Republican's foes. They come as the Trump administration has moved to examine the activities of other critics, including by authorizing a grand jury investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe that dogged Trump for much of his first term, and as FBI and Justice Department leaders signal their loyalty to the president.

Speaking to reporters during an unscheduled visit to the White House Historical Association, Trump said he had seen news coverage of Friday's searches and expected to be briefed about it by the Justice Department but also insisted he didn't “want to know about it.”

“I could know about it. I could be the one starting it. I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer. But I feel that it's better this way,” Trump said.




Bolton had said in interviews this year that he was mindful that he could be scrutinized, telling the AP in January shortly before Trump took office, “Anybody who ever disagrees with Trump has to worry about retribution. It's a pretty long list.” 

An FBI search like the one at Bolton's properties requires authorization from a federal magistrate judge. It wasn't immediately clear what information authorities submitted to demonstrate that they had probable cause of a crime, though the Justice Department years ago launched an investigation into whether Bolton improperly disclosed classified information in a book manuscript he had written. The inquiry was later closed.

Vice President JD Vance denied in an NBC News interview on Friday that Bolton was being targeted because of his criticism of Trump, “If there's no crime here, we're not going to prosecute it. If there is a crime here, of course, Ambassador Bolton will get his day in court. That's how it should be.”

Bolton was not home for the search of his home, but after it started, he was spotted Friday morning standing in the lobby of the Washington building where he keeps an office and talking to two people with “FBI” visible on their vests. He left a few minutes later and appeared to have gone upstairs in the building. Agents were seen taking bags into the office building through a back entrance. 

Messages left with a spokesperson for Bolton were not immediately returned, and a lawyer who has represented Bolton had no immediate comment.

The FBI reportedly is investigating an ex-Trump national security adviser. AP correspondent Mike Hempen reports.

The Justice Department had no comment, but leaders appeared to cryptically refer to the searches in a series of social media posts Friday morning.

FBI Director Kash Patel, who included Bolton on a list of “members of the Executive Branch Deep State” in a 2023 book he wrote, posted on X: “NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.” Attorney General Pam Bondi shared his post, adding: “America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.”

The Justice Department is separately conducting mortgage fraud investigations into Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump and his company, and ex-Trump prosecutor Jack Smith faces an investigation from an independent watchdog office. Schiff and James have vigorously denied any wrongdoing through their lawyers.

The Bolton searches also unfolded against the backdrop of a 2022 search for classified documents at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, an action that produced since-dismissed criminal charges but remains the source of outrage for the president and supporters who insist he was unjustly targeted despite the retrieval of top-secret records. 

Patel said in a Fox Business Channel interview this week that the Mar-a-Lago search represented a “total weaponization and politicization” of the bureau, and Trump himself referenced it on Friday, telling reporters: “I guess his house was raided today, but my house was raided, also.”

Bolton served as Trump's third national security adviser for 17 months and clashed with him over Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. 

He faced scrutiny during the first Trump administration over a book he wrote about his time in government that officials argued disclosed classified information. To make its case, the Justice Department in 2020 submitted sworn statements from senior administration officials, including then-National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, asserting that Bolton's manuscript included classified information that could harm national security if exposed.

Bolton's lawyers have said he moved forward with the book after a White House National Security Council official, with whom Bolton had worked for months, said the manuscript no longer contained classified information.

The Biden administration Justice Department in 2021 abandoned its lawsuit and dropped a separate grand jury investigation, with Bolton's lawyer calling the effort to block the book “politically motivated” and illegitimate. 

Bolton's harshly critical book, “The Room Where It Happened,” portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy and said he “saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.”

Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a “crazy” warmonger who would have led the country into “World War Six.”

Bolton served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush and also held positions in President Ronald Reagan's administration. He considered running for president in 2012 and 2016.

Trump, on his first day back in office this year, revoked the security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials, including Bolton. Bolton was also among a group of former Trump officials whose security details were canceled by Trump earlier this year.

In 2022, an Iranian operative was charged in a plot to kill Bolton in presumed retaliation for a 2020 U.S. airstrike that killed the country's most powerful general.

The handling of classified information by top government officials has been a politically loaded topic in recent years. Besides Trump, the Justice Department also investigated whether then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, mishandled classified information after serving as vice president in the Obama administration, and the FBI also recovered what it said were classified documents from the home of former Trump Vice President Mike Pence. Neither man was charged.

The Trump administration is cracking down on crime in D.C. and mobilizing National Guard soldiers and airmen.

The White House says National Guard activations in 19 states are unrelated to President Donald Trump's push to expand Washington, D.C.'s federal crime crackdown to other cities.

Up to 1,700 National Guardsmen are set to mobilize in 19 states in the coming weeks to assist the Department of Homeland Security with the administration's nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration.

That operation was initially announced last month and is not linked to potential federal intervention in crime-plagued cities, a White House official told Fox News.

TRUMP JOINS POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES IN WASHINGTON STREETS

""This isn't new nor is it tied to the President's efforts to address violent crime in DC,"" the official said late Friday.

""DoD announced last month that National Guard troops would assist DHS with clerical support and other logistical tasks for processing illegal aliens at ICE facilities. It is separate from the federal interagency crime crackdown.""

Trump activated the National Guard in Washington, D.C., earlier this month as part of an effort to slash violent crime in the nation's capital.

Touting the operation's success — at least 465 arrests have been made — Trump has signaled he intends to broaden the D.C. mission to other cities. ""We're going to make it safe, and we're going to then go on to other places,"" he told federal agents and Guard troops Thursday at a D.C. patrol center.

On Friday, Trump added, ""I think Chicago will be our next. And then we'll help with New York.""

The White House has now clarified the operations are separate. 

""The National Guard mobilizing to assist ICE processing with clerical and logistical tasks in several states is not the same as the President's actions to stop crime in DC,"" the official said.

The deployment of 1,700 National Guardsmen was first announced on July 25 in a Pentagon press release. Their roles include collecting personal data, fingerprinting, DNA swabbing and photographing detainees so ICE agents can focus on enforcement.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASSIGNS MILITARY ATTORNEYS TO PROSECUTE DC CRIMES AMID FEDERAL CRACKDOWN

Under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, the use of federal armed forces for civilian law enforcement is generally prohibited. But the National Guard will operate under Title 32 Section 502F authority, which does not apply to Posse Comitatus.

At the request of DHS, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in July approved hundreds of additional forces for ICE support and switched existing approvals from Title 10 to Title 32 status.

""We understood ICE's needs at that time to be more administrative in nature… as planning continued, working with our partners, it became clear more that ICE needed something different,"" a U.S. defense official told Fox News.

Meanwhile, 2,279 National Guard soldiers and airmen from Washington, D.C., and six states are already mobilized in the capital, having completed training, according to a Joint Task Force spokesperson.

The spokesperson described the figures as an ""estimate"" but said they are the most accurate available.

Under direct presidential authority, Guard members have been posted to monuments, checkpoints and traffic stops across all eight wards, with a mission of deterring crime and maintaining a visible security presence.

At Hegseth's authorization, those Guard members can now carry weapons if needed. But unlike the states, where Guard forces fall under governors' command, in D.C. they operate under direct presidential authority.

National Guard forces are carrying out presence patrols across Washington, D.C., including at Metro stations, Union Station, the National Mall and alongside U.S. Park Police.

Officials have also linked the D.C. operation to beautification efforts ahead of next year's 250th Independence Day celebration. 

Trump has hinted the Guard may remain in the city for an extended period and that the mission could expand to other parts of the country.

Protesters continue to blast the Trump administration's takeover of policing in Washington, DC, likening it to an ""invasion"" even as crime plummets.

Demonstrators, who did not appear to be part of a specific organization, on a pedestrian bridge on the I-95 in Virginia near the city this week, said that ""our systems are being assaulted.""

""What the problem is, is that these are the National Guard are like my friends' sons and daughters,"" one woman told Fox News Digital. ""It's their time away from their family. The money being wasted to make a point is really sort of disgraceful and un-American because they're sending them against actual Americans with weapons. And it's really an invasion. And we're not Russia, we're the United States of freaking America.""

TRUMP VOWED DC TAKEOVER MULTIPLE TIMES ON 2024 CAMPAIGN TRAIL: 'HE'S KEEPING HIS PROMISE'

The DC Police Union says crime has taken a tumble in since the takeover was announced by President Donald Trump earlier this month. On Thursday, it was noted that there were no reported homicides in the city in the past week.

In addition to the National Guard, numerous federal agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the FBI, are on patrol in the capital city. Attorney General Pam Bondi signed an order that prompts local officers to comply with federal immigration authorities in a strong rebuke to the city's own sanctuary policies.

""719 arrests and 91 illegal guns seized in Washington, DC Just yesterday we made 40 arrests, took 5 more illegal firearms off our streets, and had 36 ICE arrests—including a suspected MS-13 gang member. Thank you [President Trump] for your unwavering support to make DC safe again!"" Bondi posted to X on Friday morning.

Trump has threatened to take the takeover a step further in a Truth Social post on Friday.

""Washington, D.C. is SAFE AGAIN! The crowds are coming back, the spirit is high, and our D.C. National Guard and Police are doing a fantastic job. They are out in force, and are NOT PLAYING GAMES!!!"" he wrote.

""As bad as it sounds to say, there were no murders this week for the first time in memory. Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen, including a complete and total Federal takeover of the City! Washington D.C. will soon be great again!!!"" the president added.

Another protester noted that he is glad to see that crime has dropped in the city, but said declaring the crime issue in Washington D.C. was not necessary.

""I really do believe that we are edging into an area where we are not following the law, where we're not doing the things that we need to be doing in order to serve the people,"" he said.

""I'm very happy that crime's down, and it doesn't surprise me at all if you're going to have troops and a lot of people having law enforcement on the streets,"" he said. ""The problem with this is that we are making an emergency out of something that wasn't an emergency.""

Former FBI special agent Nicole Parker joins ‘America Reports' to break down the FBI raid on former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton's home in Maryland and office in Washington, D.C.

Former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who served under President Donald Trump's first administration, was the subject of FBI raids at his home and office Friday morning as federal authorities searched for classified documents. 

The raids follow a storied history between Trump and Bolton that has devolved into the pair trading repeated political blows on the public stage. 

News broke early Friday morning that FBI agents flocked around Bolton's Maryland home and were seen carrying out boxes, which was followed hours later by the FBI raiding Bolton's Washington, D.C., office.

""I'm not a fan of John Bolton,"" Trump told reporters on Friday morning after the raids began, adding he saw the reports but was not aware of details on the raid ahead of time. ""He's a real sort of a lowlife.""

""He's a very quiet person, except on television, if he can say something bad about Trump,"" Trump added. ""He's not a smart guy, but he could be a very unpatriotic guy. We're going to find out.""

The remarks echo years of past comments the pair have shared in public forums airing their dissatisfactions with one another, most notably after Trump tapped Bolton to serve as his national security advisor in 2018. 

Fox News Digital took a look back at the pair's relationship since Trump's mad dash to fill his first administration in 2017, through his ouster of Bolton as the national security advisor and the ongoing clashes the pair have shared since. 

TRUMP–BOLTON FEUD BACK IN FOCUS AFTER FBI RAID: 'NEVER HAD A CLUE … WHAT A DOPE!'

""I like (Bolton),"" Trump said in 2015 while appearing on ""Meet the Press"" just weeks after announcing his candidacy for the White House. ""I think he's, you know, a tough cookie, knows what he's talking about.""

Bolton was first speculated as a likely pick to serve as Trump's secretary of state in December 2016, when Trump was preparing for his first inauguration after his upset victory over Hillary Clinton in the election that year. Pundits touted Bolton as an experienced foreign policy hawk who could bolster Trump's diplomatic agenda, and conservative outlets such as the National Review's editorial board implored the Trump transition team to choose Bolton, identifying him as a ""hard-headed realist whose focus is always the national interest.""

Trump, however, ultimately tapped Rex Tillerson to serve as secretary of state. 

Bolton showered Trump with praise of his own ahead of his confirmation as national security advisor in 2018, calling the president ""a terrific guy"" who ""knows a lot"" when the administration kicked off in 2017.

The warm relationship got cozier when Trump announced in 2018 on X that he called on Bolton to serve as his national security advisor 

""I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.""

""I didn't really expect that announcement this afternoon,"" Bolton said on Fox News shortly after the announcement. ""But it's obviously a great honor and always an honor to serve our country.""

The pair found common ground on issues such as withdrawing the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal, which was an Obama-era agreement with other world powers to limit Iran's nuclear capabilities. 

Trump ultimately pulled the U.S. out of the agreement in 2018, slamming it as a ""horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,"" and was backed by his hawkish group of foreign policy advisors, such as Bolton and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. 

Bolton's relationship with Trump began to sour as he advanced hard-line strategies toward U.S. adversaries, including Iran and North Korea. He had long advocated regime change in Tehran, though he later clarified in his role as national security advisor that American policy was ""not regime change,"" but rather a push for ""massive change in the regime's behavior."" Trump, by contrast, initially favored a more diplomatic path, urging that flaws he saw in the Iran nuclear deal be renegotiated before ultimately deciding to withdraw from the agreement altogether. 

BOLTON TWEET DURING RAID SHOWS FOCUS WAS ELSEWHERE AS FBI SEARCHED HIS HOUSE

""John Bolton is absolutely a hawk. If it was up to him, he'd take on the whole world at one time, okay?"" Trump said of Bolton in June 2019, underscoring the bubbling tensions between the two on foreign policy. 

In April 2018, Bolton suggested North Korea follow Libya's example of denuclearization, which he called the ""Libya model,"" and included the country giving up its nuclear weapons in 2003 in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Bolton's comments about such a model for North Korea set off condemnation in Pyongyang as they raised concerns this would lead to potential regime change. 

Trump cited the comment following Bolton's abrupt exit from the White House in September 2019. 

""We were set back very badly when John Bolton talked about the Libyan model … what a disaster,"" Trump told reporters at the time. 

Days ahead of Bolton's ouster, Trump was slated to meet with Taliban leaders in an effort to negotiate peace in Afghanistan, but the meeting never took place and Bolton reportedly slammed such an effort in conversations with Trump, media outlets reported at the time.

Bolton was ousted from his role as national security advisor Sept. 10, 2019, with Trump characterizing the departure as a firing, and Bolton saying he tendered his resignation and was not fired. 

JOHN BOLTON'S HOME RAIDED BY FEDERAL AGENTS, SOURCES SAY

""I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,"" Trump tweeted in 2019. ""I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week.""

Bolton shot back on X that he ""offered to resign last night and President Trump said, ‘Let's talk about it tomorrow.'""

The former national security advisor was replaced by Robert C. O'Brien, with Trump and Bolton continuing their contentious relationship years later. 

The raid on Bolton's home is part of the ""early stages of an ongoing investigation into John Bolton,"" Vice President JD Vance said Friday during an appearance on ""Meet the Press."" Bolton was not arrested or in custody amid the early morning raids.

The Rhode Island Attorney General's Office is launching a probe after a state prosecutor was allegedly berating officers as they tried to arrest her, yelling at them: ""I'm an AG!"" (Credit: Newport Police Dept.)

The Rhode Island assistant attorney general, whose arrest went viral earlier this week after she seemingly tried to use her position to evade arrest, telling officers they'd ""regret"" putting her behind bars, will be placed on unpaid leave.

Special Assistant Attorney General Devon Flanagan, who was arrested for trespassing, was placed on paid leave directly after the incident while the Rhode Island Attorney General's office reviewed the matter. But, starting Monday, Flanagan will go on unpaid leave, the office told Fox News Digital. 

It is unclear how long Flanagan will remain on unpaid leave until a final determination is made on her employment. The Attorney General's office did not respond to additional questions about its ongoing review of the matter, or when it might make a final decision.

State payroll records, according to the Boston Globe, show that Flanagan was raking in approximately $113,000 a year in her position as a Special Assistant Attorney General.

""I'm an AG! I'm an AG!"" Flanagan could be heard saying to police as they tried to detain her for failing to comply with their demands. ""You're going to regret this. You're going to regret it. I'm an A-"" Flanagan said as she was escorted to the back of a police car and the door was shut.

""Good for you, I don't give a s---,"" one of the arresting officers can be heard saying back at one point.

In a subsequent radio interview following Flanagan's arrest, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha called the incident ""inexcusable behavior"" that will likely result in ""strong, strong sanction[s]."" However, he did note that this isn't the first time he's dealt with a case like this involving his staff.

""I've got 110 lawyers, she embarrassed all of them. I haven't had many issues like this while I've been attorney general. I've had a few, and I let one guy go for driving drunk – had to bring him back – well I didn't have to, but did bring him back after I fired him about a year later because, again, I needed somebody to go into a courtroom and try ugly, hard murder cases,"" Neronha told WPRO Radio.

""It's just really hard to find and keep capable lawyers and so I just have to think really carefully about this one. But no question there will be a strong, strong sanction here,"" the attorney general continued. 

Neronha added that he believed the incident was alcohol-related, and noted that doesn't necessarily excuse the behavior. He also said Flanagan had an ""unblemished"" record working under him, is thought highly of by the state bar association and is taking steps to make amends with the New Port Police Department, including issuing an apology.

The attorney general was asked about certain details of the incident, including whether Flanagan was right in telling the officer it was the law that he must turn off his body camera upon request by a citizen.

""I'm not sure what she was thinking. Clearly, she was not thinking straight,"" said Neronha, who added that Flanagan was incorrect in her assertion that police officers must shut off their bodycam upon request.

""She's humiliated herself,"" Neronha added. ""Regardless of what happens vis a vis her employment with us, she's going to have a long time coming back from this. It's just really unfortunate.""

U.S. immigration officials have notified Kilmar Abrego Garcia of their intent to deport him to Uganda, his attorneys said in a Saturday filing that accuses the government of pressuring Abrego Garcia to accept a plea deal.

The move comes after Abrego Garcia, who in March was wrongfully deported to an infamous prison in El Salvador, was released from a jail near Nashville, Tennessee on Friday. He had been held there since he was returned to the United States in June to face federal human smuggling charges, which he denies.

In the new filing, Abrego Garcia's lawyers say that the Trump administration offered on Thursday to deport him to Costa Rica, after serving any sentence imposed by the court, if he agreed to remain in jail until Monday and plead guilty to both counts in the criminal indictment.

Abrego Garcia declined to prolong his stay. His attorneys write that ""within minutes of his release"" on Friday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement representative informed them that ""the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda,"" ordering him to report to ICE's office in Baltimore on Monday morning.

His attorneys allege that the Trump administration is effectively forcing Abrego Garcia to choose between pleading guilty and being deported to Costa Rica, or being deported to Uganda.

""On Friday evening, the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning—precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office—to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,"" his attorneys say.

""There can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,"" Abrego Garcia's lawyers write.

His attorneys say in the filing that the administration's threat of deportation to Uganda supports their motion to dismiss the smuggling charges on account of vindictive and selective prosecution.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the new filing.

Abrego Garcia was detained by ICE on March 12 and deported to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador three days later in what the Trump administration has since called an ""administrative error.""

A U.S. judge in 2019 barred Abrego Garcia from being deported to El Salvador because of concerns that he would be persecuted there.

Abrego Garcia's case has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration's strict immigration playbook. The administration has alleged that Abrego Garcia has ties to the notorious MS-13 gang, an accusation that he denies.

A trial on the federal human smuggling charges is scheduled for January.

Eric Trump is deepening his role in digital assets with reported plans to attend a shareholder meeting in Tokyo, public predictions about bitcoin's price, and new corporate ventures that extend the Trump family's crypto push into Asia.

Bloomberg reported Friday that Trump will join a Sept. 1 shareholder meeting of Metaplanet, a Japanese company following Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly, MicroStategy) playbook, citing people familiar with the matter. Trump was appointed as a strategic adviser in March. His Tokyo stop will apparently follow an appearance at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong on Aug. 28–29. 

A day earlier, Trump appeared at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium, where he described himself as a “bitcoin maxi” and said he now spends more than half his time on crypto projects. He predicted bitcoin would reach $175,000 by the end of 2025 and eventually climb past $1 million. He argued that bitcoin and blockchain could address flaws in traditional finance, such as slow payments and settlement processes.

The Financial Times reported onAug. 15 that American Bitcoin — a miner and treasury company co-founded by Eric Trump and his brother Donald Trump Jr. — is exploring acquisitions of listed firms in Japan and Hong Kong to use them as vehicles for stockpiling bitcoin, following the playbook pioneered by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy. The company is preparing to go public in the U.S. through a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed Gryphon Digital Mining. Eric Trump is a co-founder and the chief strategy officer.

American Bitcoin emerged in May from a reorganization of American Data Centers, a Trump-linked entity that absorbed rigs from Canadian operator Hut 8. The firm has said it aims to become the world's most efficient bitcoin accumulation platform, combining active treasury management with new coin production.

The Trumps' crypto ambitions extend beyond Eric Trump. Trump Media & Technology Group, parent of Truth Social, raised more than $2 billion in the second quarter to create a bitcoin treasury. President Donald Trump disclosed in June $57 million in income from World Liberty Financial, a crypto startup launched last September.

Together, these moves highlight how Eric Trump and his family are aligning themselves with crypto at a time when Japan and Hong Kong are competing to attract digital asset firms. 

Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) will approve the first yen-denominated stablecoin as early as this fall. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has introduced the Stablecoins Ordinance, a regulatory framework that requires fiat-referenced stablecoin issuers to obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).

Cryptocurrency analyst Joao Wedson has issued a cautionary outlook for Ethereum (ETH), warning that the coming weeks may prove decisive for the second-largest cryptocurrency.

Wedson suggested that Ethereum is likely entering a reaccumulation phase, with algorithmic trading expected to cluster around the $7,000–$7,500 range. He pointed to Bitcoin's cyclical patterns, noting that ETH often attracts capital flows roughly 28 days after Bitcoin sets new record highs.

Current data, he argued, suggests that this historical rhythm could repeat, bringing renewed liquidity into Ethereum.
A key signal backing this view is Ethereum's open interest, which has surged to levels comparable with Bitcoin.

For Wedson, this underscores the potential for significant volatility. “The good news is that high volatility creates numerous opportunities,” he explained. “The bad news is that such moments of euphoria usually don't last long.”

Wedson emphasized that Ethereum currently exhibits a more resilient structure than Bitcoin, but he tempered optimism with caution. He warned that the derivatives market may face sudden, rug-pull-style price swings over the next two months, urging traders to brace for abrupt reversals.

Looking further ahead, the analyst predicted that the next bear market could begin by late 2025, likely between November and December. Until then, Ethereum's path may be defined by both strong upward moves and sharp corrective phases, as the asset navigates this transitional stage of the cycle.







XRP is back in the spotlight as traders eye a potential rally that could more than double its current value.

Bitcoin and Ethereum posted major upward moves this week, sparking renewed optimism across the crypto market.

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project that has drawn attention for its reported links to the Trump family, is preparing for a key milestone.

The race to bring Solana-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to U.S. markets is intensifying.

Key Points

Most major cryptocurrencies are being bought by treasury companies now.

Simple ideas can be powerful. Strategy (MSTR 6.10%), formerly known as MicroStrategy, has such an idea. In a nutshell, it issues new debt and new equity to raise capital for huge purchases of Bitcoin (BTC -1.42%), which it aims to hold for the long term, making it the first and largest ""crypto treasury"" company. Its shares are up by 173% in the last 12 months alone, exceeding Bitcoin's gain of 99%.

Other businesses have copied Strategy's approach, and some are even doing it with Ethereum (ETH -1.43%). But could Ripple's XRP (XRP -2.15%) be next in line for corporate treasurers?

Image source: Getty Images.

Once a playbook looks like it works, it tends to spread. That's why companies beyond Strategy have adopted Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset, including Semler Scientific, which formalized a Bitcoin treasury approach in 2024 and continues to telegraph its accumulation targets through 2025.

Meanwhile, a second and third wave of crypto treasury companies are coalescing around buying hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of other popular cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, as well as some of the forgotten coins of yesteryear, like Litecoin, and even some downright outlandish picks like Dogecoin. Those businesses rely on the same principles of using debt or equity issuance to fund purchases of their asset of choice.

But their long-term growth prospects are quite different, because ultimately, they vary depending on the chosen asset. The investment thesis for Ethereum has more to do with its utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) than with its scarcity, which is a far more relevant factor in the investment thesis for Bitcoin. These two coins could and probably will both perform well, but there isn't much reason to expect that they will perform equally.

For investors, the proposition is that buying stocks in crypto treasuries is similar to owning the underlying coin, but with leverage created by choices like whether the company uses convertible bonds, equity raises, or other forms of financing. There's also some overhead associated with buying a crypto treasury instead of the underlying asset: The companies have expenses, as well as some added risk brought on by the organizational and governance factors that are inherent in a public company.

Nonetheless, the most appetizing piece is that when the underlying crypto asset soars, the stock will likely outperform it. Of course, when the coin falls, shareholder dilution or debt can bite hard, and debt is generally something that needs to be managed carefully and proactively.

So, if the market now tolerates a swath of different reserve assets for crypto treasuries, the door is open for XRP-only versions to emerge -- and they are.

A few companies have begun accumulating XRP for their balance sheets. VivoPower announced in late May what it described as an XRP-focused crypto treasury strategy alongside a $121 million private placement, with intent to buy and hold XRP and build its internal DeFi capabilities.

It isn't the only one either. In July, Nature's Miracle Holding established an XRP treasury program worth $20 million, funded via a registered equity facility. As of late August, at least 10 other XRP-targeted treasury businesses and purchasing plans are already forming up quickly, with some calling for allocations as high as $500 million.

Assuming that more dedicated XRP treasuries are initiated, investors will face the same trade-offs as described above.

Buying shares in a crypto treasury is not the same as buying XRP. The stock adds operating risk, financing risk, and dilution risk on top of the coin's volatility. It might outperform in a steep XRP bull run, but it can also underperform badly if management issues stock into strength, borrows at the wrong time, or executes the plan badly.

Therefore, for most long-term investors who want exposure to the upside from the thesis that corporate treasuries will accumulate XRP and constrain its float and thereby generate higher prices, the simpler and safer route is to buy and hold XRP directly. Buying the coin directly gets you the potential upside if crypto treasury demand leads to durable buying, but you will also avoid the risks that come with a small public company's balance sheet decisions.

Own the asset you actually want to own, not an IOU from something else that owns it, and only add the leverage and management risk if you truly mean to.

The creators of Xai, a layer-3 gaming blockchain built on Ethereum, have sued Elon Musk's xAI for trademark infringement—and are asking a federal court to force the billionaire's artificial intelligence company to change its name and branding in contexts related to video games and blockchain. 

In November, Musk announced plans to start an AI video game studio within xAI, to “make games great again.” Ex Populus, the company behind gaming blockchain Xai, now claims that Musk's announcement immediately created “substantial actual confusion” online between their established video game brand, Xai, and Musk's xAI gaming venture. 

Numerous news aggregators and commentators used the blockchain's logo in announcements about Musk's venture, the company's attorneys claim, and many more internet users mistook the separate ventures to be related. What's more, Grok—Musk's AI chatbot—also confused the two separate entities, and told X users they were both controlled by Musk's companies, the attorneys said.

In a complaint filed Thursday, Ex Populus asked a federal court in northern California to order Musk's AI company to cease using any words or symbols likely to cause confusion with Xai's registered trademark, in the contexts of video gaming and blockchain.

It also requested punitive damages and all profits reaped by Musk's companies for the alleged infringement. 

Ex Populus' attorneys repeatedly argued in their complaint that Musk's company has not only consistently infringed on their copyright since last year—but, further, that the particular notoriety and controversy associated with the world's richest man have made the alleged infringement particularly damaging to their brand.

Ex Populus took legal action today to protect the Xai brand. With increased confusion around Elon Musk's AI company (@xai), it's a big responsibility to safeguard the brand that the community trusts. You can read more details at https://t.co/ce8Aw9hNCZ

“Musk and defendants' xAI company routinely receive substantive negative media attention that is now being attributed to plaintiff's XAI trademark,” the attorneys wrote. 

The lawyers made particular note of a controversy that erupted last month when Musk's AI bot, Grok, referred to itself as “MechaHitler” for a brief period and made antisemitic, racist, and sexually violent comments across the X platform.

“Plaintiff losing control over its goodwill is irreparable harm sufficient to support an injunction to cease defendants' use of the infringing xAI marks,” Ex Populus' attorneys said, “but to be associated with Nazism, hate speech, and violence exacerbates the harm exponentially.”

Ex Populus said in a statement that Musk's attorneys reached out to them recently about trademark issues, and that, now, the company feels it has no option but to fight back “or risk losing [the trademark] altogether.” 

“This case isn't just about Ex Populus or Xai,” the company said. “It speaks to something bigger: the right of smaller innovators to build without having their identity swallowed by tech giants.”

Musk's xAI did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment on this story.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Ethereum's Price Plunge Fuels Altcoin Aspirations","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/ethereum-price-plunge-altcoin-opportunities","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 15:45:09 GMT","

When Ethereum's value dipped below $4,200, it sent shockwaves through the investing community, compelling traders to rethink their positioning in this unpredictable cryptocurrency landscape. As Ethereum's price swings from highs to lows, the spotlight is shifting to nascent altcoins, particularly Cardano (ADA) and the intriguing MAGACOIN FINANCE. This exploration addresses the current predicament of Ethereum, the invigorating prospects of Cardano, and the burgeoning buzz surrounding MAGACOIN, illustrating how these factors might redefine investment approaches in an erratic market.

Ethereum, known for its foundational role in a myriad of decentralized applications, finds itself in the glare of scrutiny following its recent downturn. After scaling the heights to nearly $4,700, the recent drop raises pertinent questions—could this be a mere blip, or does it signal more profound concerns? Major players in the market are taking a hard look at their positions, weighing Ethereum's fundamental stability against overarching market currents. The exodus of over $200 million from Ethereum-linked investments marks a critical juncture where the second-largest cryptocurrency must demonstrate tenacity to bounce back and restore faith among institutional investors.

In stark contrast to Ethereum's volatility, Cardano has been demonstrating impressive resilience. This altcoin has surged more than 17% this month, standing out during a period when many are retreating. With groundbreaking initiatives and a formidable $71 million development strategy drawn from its on-chain resources, ADA is fortifying its platform. Upgrades like Hydra scaling and Mithril syncing are poised to enhance its efficiency, sparking speculation among traders. Some analysts even project that ADA might deliver returns that exceed Bitcoin's history, considering its relatively modest market cap and untapped potential for monumental growth.

While the crypto landscape continues to shift, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a beacon for innovative investors. This budding altcoin combines the spirit of meme culture with substantial decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, hinting at an extraordinary upside potential of 30x or greater. Early analysts are touting MAGACOIN as a hidden treasure, reminiscent of the early days of successful projects like Cardano. With a comprehensive audit process and transparent tokenomics, MAGACOIN aims to establish itself as a formidable player in the forthcoming bullish season, enticing traders to consider it as a counterbalance against Ethereum's recent struggles.

In this fluctuating environment, adaptability in investment strategies is not just advisable—it's essential. The recent upheavals surrounding Ethereum underscore the significance of seeking out emerging altcoins on the rise. As speculation suggests a potential correction of Ethereum down to $4,150, traders should look to diversify their portfolios with promising assets like Cardano and MAGACOIN, allowing for a balanced risk profile while exploring expansive avenues for growth. By paying attention to significant trading activity and prevailing trends, investors can position themselves to capitalize on critical developments before the market consolidates.

While the pursuit of altcoins promises thrilling opportunities, lurking regulatory challenges must not be overlooked. The cross-border payment frameworks embraced by many nascent tokens are under increasing scrutiny, leading to the need for strict compliance measures. For U.S.-based Web3 ventures and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), navigating the regulatory landscape alongside innovative development remains vital to safeguarding investments from unforeseen legal backlash.

Ethereum's recent downturn has not only reignited interest in the broader cryptocurrency arena but has also highlighted the enticing prospects of altcoins like Cardano and MAGACOIN FINANCE. As traders recalibrate their strategies in light of these shifts, technological advancements and unique market niches in these emerging tokens may unlock significant financial rewards for those astute enough to navigate this rapidly changing environment. Embracing this complexity, marked by dynamic investment patterns and ongoing innovation, could very well lead to a treasure trove of opportunities as the future of decentralized finance continues to unfold.

- NFT floor price trackers are rising in popularity as collectors seek real-time market insights and trading strategies amid volatile NFT values.

- Developers use Python and CoinGecko API endpoints to build customizable tools for fetching live/historical NFT data and generating trend analyses.

- Advanced features include SMA/EMA-based trading signals, interactive Dash dashboards with price visualizations, and automated email alerts for price thresholds.

- Paid CoinGecko API tiers unlock granular data access while tools like Poetry/Docker streamline deployment for scalable NFT market analysis solutions.

The rise of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has spurred growing interest in tracking their floor prices—defined as the lowest price at which an NFT within a collection is listed for sale. This metric offers crucial insights into market demand and trading strategies [1]. Given the daily fluctuations in NFT values, building a customizable and interactive floor price tracker has become a valuable endeavor for collectors and investors [1].

A practical solution is to construct such a tool using Python and the CoinGecko API. The CoinGecko API provides a variety of endpoints that facilitate data extraction, including the `/nfts/list` for identifying NFT collections, `/nfts/{id}` for current data on a specific collection, and `/nfts/{id}/market_chart` for historical price data [1]. Developers can use these endpoints to fetch real-time and historical data, enabling deeper market analysis.

The implementation process begins with Python libraries such as `requests` and `json` for making API calls and parsing data. A common approach involves creating a function to test API connectivity using the `/ping` endpoint. For those using the free Demo API plan, the request headers require a valid API key, which should be securely stored rather than hardcoded for public visibility [1].

For more advanced use cases, including historical data retrieval and interactive visualization, developers can leverage the CoinGecko Pro API. Endpoints like `/nfts/{id}/market_chart` and `/nfts/markets` allow for in-depth trend analysis, particularly when combined with a Dash framework to build an interactive web-based dashboard [1]. This dashboard can include dynamic visualizations such as bar plots for market data and line charts for historical price movements [1].

A critical feature of the tracker is its ability to generate trading signals based on moving averages. Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) can help identify upward or downward trends in NFT prices. These signals are visualized on the dashboard, offering users actionable insights [1]. Moreover, automated email alerts can be configured to notify users when price thresholds are crossed, enhancing the tool's utility for real-time decision-making [1].

For users seeking more advanced data access, CoinGecko offers paid API plans such as the Analyst and Lite tiers, which unlock exclusive endpoints like `/nfts/{id}/tickers` and `/nfts/{asset_platform_id}/contract/{contract_address}/market_chart`. These endpoints provide granular data including platform-specific floor prices and historical market charts based on contract addresses [1].

The tutorial also recommends using dependency management tools such as Poetry for streamlined project setup and Docker for containerization, enabling easier deployment across platforms [1]. By following these guidelines, developers can build a robust and scalable NFT floor price tracker tailored to their specific analytical needs.

XRP advanced sharply during the Aug. 22–23 session, testing multi-month resistance near $3.10 after weeks of sideways trading. 

The move coincided with dovish commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole, which reinforced expectations of a September rate cut and lifted risk sentiment across digital assets. 

On-chain settlement volumes on the XRP Ledger surged 500% earlier this week, adding to optimism around institutional adoption despite ongoing whale distribution.

• XRP gained 8.56% across the 23-hour session from August 22 at 11:00 to August 23 at 10:00, climbing from $2.83 to $3.03, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data.• The token swung between $2.79 and $3.10, creating an 11% intraday range.• The breakout occurred at 14:00 UTC on August 22, with XRP surging from $2.84 to $3.03 on 667.4 million volume—five times session averages.• Late-session volatility capped the move, with XRP retreating 0.47% in the final hour to settle near $3.01.• Support has consolidated around $2.97–$3.00 while resistance remains firm at $3.08–$3.10.

• Breakout levels: $2.84–$2.97 accumulation zone triggered upside impulse on high volume.• Resistance: Strong supply pressure emerged at $3.08–$3.10, rejecting further advance.• Support: New floor forming at $2.97–$3.00 psychological level, repeatedly defended intraday.• Volume: Breakout candle logged 667.4 million trades, 72% above weekly average.• Structure: Pattern resembles continuation setup if $3.00 holds, though fading volume late in the session suggests consolidation before next leg.

• Whether $3.00 support holds during profit-taking, or if a deeper retrace tests $2.95.• Breakout confirmation above $3.08–$3.10 zone, which could open the path toward $3.25.• Fed policy signals ahead of the September meeting, and impact on risk asset flows.• On-chain activity, which has surged to 844 million tokens settled in a single day, signaling enterprise adoption potential.• Whale flows, as recent exchange deposits continue to weigh on intraday momentum.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Bitcoin News: Eric Trump's BTC Price Predictions, Acquisition Plans, and Metaplanet Visit","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/08/23/eric-trump-makes-bitcoin-price-predictions-as-he-reportedly-gets-ready-to-visit-metaplanet","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 17:37:30 GMT","

Eric Trump is deepening his role in digital assets with reported plans to attend a shareholder meeting in Tokyo, public predictions about bitcoin's price, and new corporate ventures that extend the Trump family's crypto push into Asia.

Bloomberg reported Friday that Trump will join a Sept. 1 shareholder meeting of Metaplanet, a Japanese company following Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly, MicroStategy) playbook, citing people familiar with the matter. Trump was appointed as a strategic adviser in March. His Tokyo stop will apparently follow an appearance at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong on Aug. 28–29. 

A day earlier, Trump appeared at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium, where he described himself as a “bitcoin maxi” and said he now spends more than half his time on crypto projects. He predicted bitcoin would reach $175,000 by the end of 2025 and eventually climb past $1 million. He argued that bitcoin and blockchain could address flaws in traditional finance, such as slow payments and settlement processes.

The Financial Times reported onAug. 15 that American Bitcoin — a miner and treasury company co-founded by Eric Trump and his brother Donald Trump Jr. — is exploring acquisitions of listed firms in Japan and Hong Kong to use them as vehicles for stockpiling bitcoin, following the playbook pioneered by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy. The company is preparing to go public in the U.S. through a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed Gryphon Digital Mining. Eric Trump is a co-founder and the chief strategy officer.

American Bitcoin emerged in May from a reorganization of American Data Centers, a Trump-linked entity that absorbed rigs from Canadian operator Hut 8. The firm has said it aims to become the world's most efficient bitcoin accumulation platform, combining active treasury management with new coin production.

The Trumps' crypto ambitions extend beyond Eric Trump. Trump Media & Technology Group, parent of Truth Social, raised more than $2 billion in the second quarter to create a bitcoin treasury. President Donald Trump disclosed in June $57 million in income from World Liberty Financial, a crypto startup launched last September.

Together, these moves highlight how Eric Trump and his family are aligning themselves with crypto at a time when Japan and Hong Kong are competing to attract digital asset firms. 

Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) will approve the first yen-denominated stablecoin as early as this fall. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has introduced the Stablecoins Ordinance, a regulatory framework that requires fiat-referenced stablecoin issuers to obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).

Cryptocurrencies surged late Friday after Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell struck a dovish tone at the Jackson Hole economic symposium, defying market expectations for a more hawkish stance. That has prompted asset managers to call for new all-time highs for bitcoin BTC$115,063.99, ether (ETH) and select altcoins.

In one of his most important speeches, Powell suggested that the labor market could benefit from lower borrowing costs, having held the benchmark interest rate steady at 4.25% for eight months.

“Downside risks to employment are rising,” Powell said in prepared remarks for his keynote speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium, adding that the possibility of President Donald Trump's tariffs having only a short-lived effect on inflation is “reasonable.”

“With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” he noted.

Cryptocurrencies and stocks soared, and the probability of the September Fed rate cut jumped to 90% following the speech. Most analysts expect the momentum to continue in the days ahead.

Analysts at Monarq Asset Management anticipate that ether's price will rise above $5,000 in the coming days.

""We maintain our overall bullish stance. Market internals remain constructive, with few signs of overheating and, as you point out, a clear path to new all-time highs in both BTC and ETH,"" Sam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management's Directional Fund, told CoinDesk.

""Our house view is that Powell's dovish pivot has cleared the way for $5,000+ in the near term (also not the hardest call to make). Demand from treasury vehicles should increase into the fall as many of the deals announced this summer close or de-SPAC, in addition to ongoing institutional and retail inflows,"" Gaer added.

Ethereum's native token ether has already gained nearly 10% in 24 hours, hitting record highs above $4,800. As of writing, it changed hands at $4,700, according to CoinDesk data. Meanwhile, market leader bitcoin traded near $115,600, slightly down from the overnight high of $117,400.

Data from Deribit-listed options shows that ether's rally has sparked renewed demand for upside bets, or call options. At press time, risk reversals were positive across all tenors, implying relative richness of calls. The sentiment wasn't so bullish in BTC options.

Gaer stated that over-the-counter desks and market makers are experiencing stronger demand for ETH compared to BTC, suggesting that ether may outperform ahead.

That said, BTC looked strong on its own, too. ""The BTC pullback from ATH was ~9.6%—far less than earlier drawdowns this year—indicating strong demand, as evidenced by whale wallet accumulation around the $113k level,"" Gaer said.

Spencer Yang, managing partner at BlockSpaceForce, a crypto treasury advisory firm, said more rate cuts could happen after September, ensuring the momentum extends well into the year-end.

""We're now fully expecting rate cuts to happen in September. It will be the first cut since Trump became President this year. This is significant, and many more will come,"" Yang said, calling new highs in the crypto market.

""The major 5 that we pay attention to: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, LINK. These will do well given the various parts of the crypto industry they impact,"" Yang added.

Steve Lee, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital and investor in BlockTower Capital, called Powell's dovish turn a short-term constructive development for cryptocurrencies while stressing the importance of continued inflows into bitcoin and ether spot ETFs.

""I see this as constructive in the short term, and it may help reverse this week's sell-off. The key question is whether this momentum holds beyond the low-liquidity weekend. Since BTC and ETH price action is increasingly institutionally driven, spot ETF flows today and Monday will be a strong indicator of whether we are set for another leg higher,"" Lee told CoinDesk.

Lee highlighted Base, Monad, Story, and SUI as key projects of interest that he is closely monitoring in his capacity as an early-stage venture capitalist.

Gaer, meanwhile, favored Solana and the SOL ecosystem, including high-beta SOL tokens such as JITO and JUP. Raydium and PUMP on both a ""fundamental and forward-demand basis.""

While Powell's dovish stance has set the stage for a rally, traders should remain cautious about potential pitfalls from corporate treasury cryptocurrency adoption and volatility in equity markets.

""Digital asset treasuries"" (DAT) are an innovative vehicle for public market investors to gain exposure to the digital asset space. However, we have started to see the quality of DAT deals – from banking relationships, compliance, management team, and deal structure perspectives — dropping, which shows early signs of a 'bubble,"" Lee said.

Naqsdaq-listed Strategy started this trend of corporate BTC adoption in 2020. Since then, more than 100 publicly-listed firms have accumulated a total of 984,971 BTC, according to data source Bitcoin Treasuries. 

""The trend may continue, but it is obvious that the risks associated with this are not ignorable,"" Lee added.

Gaer called for closely tracking risks from an overheated equity market and ""potential for macro or geopolitical shocks.""

Bee venom saved a woman's life—and could be the basis of future drugs for a range of painful conditions.

One sunny day, Ellie Lobel, who had a Ph.D. in nuclear physics and three children, was attacked by a horde of Africanized bees, commonly called “killer” bees. Lobel shielded her eyes and expected to have a deadly anaphylactic reaction, she said in a 2015 BBC article describing her experience. The 45-year-old English woman was in palliative care in California because she was dying from Lyme disease. She had stepped outside to experience some sunshine and peace when the bees attacked. Swollen and in pain, Lobel expected the end was imminent. At least, that's what she thought.

Fifteen years earlier, Lobel had unknowingly endured a tick bite. The tick carried the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. If caught in time, Lyme disease is treatable with antibiotics, though the bacteria are known to sneak around the immune system and even cause flare-ups long after apparent recovery. Borrelia burgdorferi can travel everywhere in the body, even to the heart and brain, causing neurological degradation, terrible pain, and a host of complications. About 476,000 people per year get Lyme disease in the U.S., according to a CDC report from March. Unfortunately, Lobel—whose doctors didn't identify the symptoms as Lyme disease until over a year after she was bitten at age 27—was one of the unlucky ones. Suffering with increasingly unbearable symptoms in a body that was breaking down, Lobel had accepted that she wouldn't live long.

For three days after the bee attack, Lobel endured fevers and throbbing inflammation. On the fourth day, she woke and unexpectedly felt normal, the first time she felt a sliver of normalcy in 15 years. Over the next days, weeks, and months, Lobel's condition improved dramatically, her brain fog clearing, her pain diminishing, and her strength returning. While researching bee venom, she realized that the melittin in the venom, which causes an instant burning sensation under the skin during bee stings, must have been her savior. Blood tests later confirmed that there was no more Borrelia in her body. It was gone.

Many cultures have touted the benefits of animal venom. Bee venom therapy in particular has been used as far back as ancient Egypt, says a 2024 article from research database company EBSCO. Modern studies show that bee venom's key component melittin has “antibacterial and antifungal activities, and potential anti-tumor properties,” according to a 2017 paper in the journal Neuroscience Bulletin. Mice and in vitro studies have also proven its antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-cancer effects. A small protein molecule composed of 26 amino acids, melittin contains both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory compounds, and it can literally make bacterial cells explode because it weakens a cell's protective membrane. A November 2017 study of bee venom and melittin published in the journal Antibiotics showed that, at least outside of a living organism, the compound killed Borrelia burgdorferi.

Researchers looking for new therapeutic drugs have been making forays into the potential of animal venom for decades, with some succeeding. Perhaps the most famous contemporary example is Ozempic, whose main drug compound mimics a venom component of the Gila monster, a venomous lizard native to the southwestern U.S.

In 1997, Glenn King at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia put the venom of the deadly Australian funnel-web spider under scrutiny, and figured out how to tease out its disparate components. “I was just blown away,” he told the BBC. “This is an absolute pharmacological goldmine that nobody's really looked at.” Now he and other researchers are developing a drug from a key molecule in the venom that prevents injuries to heart cells during heart attacks.

Many therapeutic venom studies haven't passed the point of animal testing though. Anecdotal and preliminary studies show that bee venom could relieve pain, symptoms of Parkinson's disease, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis when a trained medical professional injects it under the skin. Bee venom is also being investigated for use in killing HIV cells. However, more research is needed before it could potentially become a standard treatment for any of these conditions, according to the Mayo Clinic. 

Lobel herself went on to experiment extensively with bee venom—on herself—and eventually developed a self-administered treatment protocol for Lyme disease, ensuring the elimination of her own disease in the process. She has spent the past several years promoting her Bee Venom Therapy protocol for Lyme disease—which uses live honey bees' stings—and educating people about the disease. Lobel has also written a book about how to self-administer bee sting therapy if you suffer from this disease. However, medical professionals consider it a controversial alternative treatment because it is not approved by any medical agency, and the Centers for Disease Control doesn't mention it as a treatment.

Some people who have used the therapy and found relief, like Rebecca Hayward of the UK, report that it's a last-ditch effort because nothing else has worked to relieve their terrible symptoms. But the treatment doesn't work the same for everybody, she cautions, and the very real possibility of dying from a bee venom allergy always hovers in the background. The top of Hayward's article on the Lyme Disease UK website recommends not attempting self-treatment “without precautionary measures and oversight by a medical professional.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Here's Why Crypto Set the Market on Fire Yesterday","https://gizmodo.com/crypto-rally-powell-speech-2000647235","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 12:56:24 GMT","

Cryptocurrency markets skyrocketed into new territory Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that interest rate reductions could be imminent, pushing the Dow to its first 800-point plus gain this year. That ended the Dow's longest streak without a new high since Dec. 4, 2024, according to Dow Jones Market Data, and signaled a major surge of optimism at the prospect of some economic policy relief.

Cryptos were major stars of that rally.

Ethereum (ETH) climbed over 15% to reach a new all-time high of $4,885, surpassing its previous record from November 2021, while Solana (SOL) swung between 8% and 12.5% in a 24-hour period, nudging just past the longtime “psychological” mark of $200 for a high of $201.94. Bitcoin (BTC) lovers also had their moment when it climbed 2.5% to $114,700 from $112,000, clawing back some of its losses from earlier this week.

As cryptocurrencies and stocks soared, the probability of a September Fed rate cut jumped to 90% following the speech, Reuters reports.

Simply put: When the market feels more secure, it invests in places considered riskier bets. Cryptocurrencies and other fintechs that are part of emerging technology sit squarely in those crosshairs.

This time it appears institutional investors led the charge, as they look for investments that can balance out a shaky U.S. dollar, general volatility, and risk.

“It's almost a relief rally,” Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, told the Wall Street Journal. “Markets had anticipated more angst.”

The optimism from the market is a sign monetary easing is a reversal of that angst, and could be a change in fortune for the sector, which has whipsawed in recent trading, said Steve Lee, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital and investor in BlockTower Capital.

“I see this as constructive in the short term, and it may help reverse this week's sell-off. The key question is whether this momentum holds beyond the low-liquidity weekend. Since BTC and ETH price action is increasingly institutionally driven, spot ETF flows today and Monday will be a strong indicator of whether we are set for another leg higher,” Lee told CoinDesk.

As usual, Powell got straight to the point during his Wyoming speech on Friday.

“Downside risks to employment are rising,” Powell said at the Jackson Hole Symposium. “And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.”

Powell also said recent policy moves from the Trump administration could affect inflation.

“With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” he said, adding that tariffs could push inflation higher, at least temporarily. “A reasonable base case is that the effects will be relatively short lived, a one-time shift in the price level.”

You can read Powell's entire speech here.

In this rally's case, a rising tide did indeed lift all boats.

The broader S&P 500 also saw strong gains, rising 1.5%, its best performance since May, and equities were a bright spot on the NASDAQ Composite, which advanced 1.9%.

But perhaps most importantly, the index used by Wall Street to gauge how frightened investors might be, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), dipped more than 14% to its lowest level this year. The VIX is a favorite of trading pros and shows how turbulent the market feels.

Those gains across the board are an encouraging sign for both the buyside and the sellside, experts said.

“Correlations between cryptos and equities are high, and we see a market mood that will be highly sensitive to this week's comments from the Jackson Hole meeting of monetary authorities, as well as from any reactions from fiscal authorities,” wrote Manuel Villegas, an analyst at Julius Baer, in a research note.

While nothing is a given once the opening bell rings, some analysts are already predicting which companies they think will continue to do well.

Analysts at Monarq Asset Management told CoinDesk that there's still more room for Ethereum to grow, and that they expect to see the coin top $5,000 in near-term trade.

“We maintain our overall bullish stance. Market internals remain constructive, with few signs of overheating and, as you point out, a clear path to new all-time highs in both BTC and ETH,” Sam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management's Directional Fund, told CoinDesk.

“Our house view is that Powell's dovish pivot has cleared the way for $5,000+ in the near term, also not the hardest call to make,” Gaer said. “Demand from treasury vehicles should increase into the fall as many of the deals announced this summer close or de-SPAC, in addition to ongoing institutional and retail inflows.”

Friday's rally was a perfect example of how sensitive global markets are to Fed policy, particularly after a long period of no rate cuts. Analysts, traders, and every other player in finance have been attempting to read Powell's tea leaves for years with only moderate success, and even a major rally like Friday's can't completely fortify a very fragile market.

While no one can be entirely certain what Powell and the Fed will do next week, market watchers across the board are bullish on the move. “The Fed isn't going to be the party-pooper,” Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, told the WSJ.

How much that rate cut might matter in the long run remains to be seen.

“We're still doubtful that a September cut points to a prolonged interest rate cutting cycle. Risks to inflation are real and coming from many angles,” Lauren Goodwin, economist and chief market strategist at New York Life Investments, wrote in a Friday note.

What's better than a motherboard with a soldered high-end mobile AMD Ryzen CPU?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


When we talk about mobile chips, it's usually within the confines of a laptop chassis, or something like a gaming handheld. Very rarely does a SoC break free of its portable enclosure, but when it does, it's seldom as interesting as this. Tianba (via momomo_us), a Chinese PC hardware brand owned by Aoostar, has just unveiled its new MoDT (mobile on desktop) motherboards, which feature top-of-the-line mobile CPUs designed for use in a tower configuration. It comes in two options: either a Ryzen 9 9955HX or a 9955HX3D—the flagship mobile gaming CPU from AMD right now.

For some context, yes; desktop motherboards equipped with mobile processors (meant initially for laptops) are a thing, and they're pretty common in China. The appeal of such a setup largely boils down to the cost savings of a mobile chip. Moreover, any processor in a laptop is usually thermally constrained, even with the most extravagant cooling, so giving it the proper desktop treatment with an air or liquid cooler will unlock the full potential of the SKU.

The downside, of course, is that you're locked in forever. The CPU is soldered onto the motherboard, so if you ever plan to change it, you will have to replace your entire motherboard with a new one. That being said, every other part of Tianba's motherboard is otherwise standard. First of all, it's in the mATX form factor, so it's relatively compact, and the design looks sleek with silver accents across the black PCB.



There's a full-length x16 PCIe 5.0 slot for the GPU, along with two Gen5x4 M.2 slots for the SSDs. The motherboard supports dual-channel memory with its two DIMM slots, and Tianba is advertising a vapor chamber heatsink with ""strong heat dissipation."" More importantly, there's a 10-phase VRM which puts this motherboard in line with most midrange B650s you can get off the shelf. The company did not provide further details on the connectivity, so we are unsure how many fan or RGB headers are onboard.

Returning to the chip options for this, the Ryzen 9 9955HX and 9995HX3D are essentially identical, apart from the 3D V-Cache found in the latter. They're 16-core, 32-thread CPUs with 54W TDPs and boost clocks of up to 5.4GHz. The main difference lies in the amount of cache, as the 995HX3D features 144 MB of L3 cache, while the 9955HX has only half of that at 72 MB. But even that's plenty, as in most tasks, these chips will be neck-and-neck with each other while comfortably beating every other gaming CPU.



This isn't even the first time we've seen an X3D processor make it to the MoDT platform, as Minisfoum launched an ITX motherboard featuring the Ryzen 9 7945HX3D just this year. Previously, we had Raptor Lake SKUs in this form factor, and even major system integrators like Lenovo and Asus have ventured into this market with desktop pre-built systems powered by mobile chips.

Tianba has priced its new MoDT motherboard at 3,799 Yuan, or $530 USD, and that's for the 9955HX version. The 9955HX3D model will cost you 4,799 Yuan, which translates to approximately $670 USD. If we examine the desktop counterparts for these chips, you'll save a considerable amount. The Ryzen 9 9950X launched at $649, but you can now find it for as low as $434. Meanwhile, the 9950X3D's suggested retail price is $699, and it typically remains at or around that price.

Add to this a decent B650 motherboard, such as the MSI Tomahawk, which costs around $200, and you're already surpassing the price of Tianba's MoDT offerings. Of course, they are mobile chips at the end of the day—even with all the cooling and power in the world, the desktop counterpart will be faster—but not everyone needs that kind of performance and would rather settle for a bundle that's close enough.

The non-coding genome, once dismissed as ""junk DNA"", is now recognized as a fundamental regulator of gene expression and a key player in understanding complex diseases. Following the landmark achievements of the Human Genome Project (HGP), scientists have increasingly focused on deciphering the non-coding regions of the human genome, which comprise approximately 98% of the genetic material.

These regions, long overlooked due to their non-protein-coding nature, are now known to harbor regulatory elements crucial for cell function and disease progression.

The realization that non-coding DNA plays a pivotal role in gene regulation has transformed the way scientists understand genomic architecture. Integrative approaches, combining genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, have revealed that non-coding regions are not mere bystanders but actively participate in controlling gene expression through a network of enhancers, promoters, and chromatin modifications. These elements are involved in the three-dimensional organization of the genome, allowing for long-range interactions that regulate cellular function.

Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been instrumental in uncovering the regulatory potential of the non-coding genome. High-throughput techniques such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq have enabled the identification of transcription factor binding sites, open chromatin regions, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts.

Furthermore, methods like chromosome conformation capture (3C) and Hi-C have provided insights into chromatin architecture, highlighting the spatial relationships between enhancers and promoters.

A key breakthrough lies in understanding how non-coding variants contribute to disease. Studies have demonstrated that mutations within enhancer regions, promoter sequences, and regulatory RNAs can disrupt gene expression, leading to various genetic disorders and cancers.

For instance, mutations in enhancer elements of the SNCA gene are linked to Parkinson's disease, while alterations in the TERT promoter are associated with cancer progression. These findings underscore the importance of non-coding DNA in maintaining genomic stability and preventing pathological transformations.

The transition from seeing non-coding DNA as biological noise to recognizing its regulatory significance marks a paradigm shift in genomic medicine. As researchers continue to map the regulatory landscape, the potential for precision medicine becomes increasingly apparent. By targeting non-coding elements implicated in disease etiology, it may be possible to develop tailored therapies that address the root causes of gene dysregulation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Reyna completes move to Gladbach as Dortmund admits he needed 'new chapter'","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/usmnt/2025/08/23/gio-reyna-gladbach-dortmund-transfer-official-usmnt/85796946007/","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 17:42:46 GMT","

Gio Reyna has completed arguably the most badly-needed move in the entire U.S. men's national team pool, with Borussia Mönchengladbach announcing he had signed a three-year deal after a transfer from Borussia Dortmund.

The clubs did not announce a transfer fee, but Sky Germany reported that the move will cost Die Folen €3 million up front, with a possible €4 million in possible bonuses.

Speaking to his new side's club site, Reyna said Gladbach is ""a fantastic, big club.""

""I'm delighted that the transfer has been able to be completed and am looking forward to getting to know everyone here, as well as tackling the upcoming games together,"" said the USMNT playmaker, whose place with the national team was under some pressure thanks to a stuttering club career. During the 2024-25 season, Reyna started just five times, playing a total of 627 minutes for Dortmund.

That lack of playing time came after an ill-advised loan move to Nottingham Forest resulted in just 231 total minutes in the back half of the 2023-24 campaign, leaving Reyna with fewer than 1,000 minutes of playing time in the last 19 months of club soccer.

A move was something all parties seemed to agree was needed. Dortmund gave his No. 7 shirt to new signing Jobe Bellingham earlier this month, while USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino has repeatedly spoken about the importance he places on players getting on the field regularly ahead of the World Cup next summer.

Dortmund acknowledged that things hadn't gone according to plan for a player who became a first-choice regular in 2020-21 only for injuries, a crowded depth chart, and a lack of progress to reduce him to a bit-part role.

""We have a long history with Gio. He experienced a very rapid rise at BVB at the beginning of his career, culminating in the 2021 [DFB Pokal] victory,"" said Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl in his club's release confirming the move. ""Unfortunately, his development in recent seasons has not progressed as we all hoped.

""This is one of the reasons why it is now time for him to begin a new chapter in his sporting career. We wish Gio much success and hope that he stays healthy and regains his former strength through playing time and confidence in Mönchengladbach.""

The next step for Reyna will be entirely on him, as he'll have to find a way into manager Gerardo Seoane's preferred lineup. With Seoane often playing out of a 4-2-3-1 and Reyna able to play centrally or on either flank, the system involved shouldn't be a major issue. Attacking midfielder Kevin Stöger and wingers Franck Honorat and Robin Hack are first-choice, with the latter pair likely more well-established in starting roles.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

With just over a week remaining before the transfer window closes in Europe's top leagues, clubs are making final decisions on key players. That includes Giovanni Reyna, teammate of Christian Pulisic at USMNT, who appears close to departing Borussia Dortmund.

According to reporter Florian Plettenberg, Reyna has agreed in recent hours to a move to Borussia Monchengladbach and will continue his career in the Bundesliga—though with a team that has fewer title aspirations than Dortmund.

“The total transfer fee is up to €7m (approximately $8.2 million) – €3m guaranteed plus €4m in potential add-ons. Around €3m of those are considered realistic bonuses,” Plettenberg added Saturday in a post on his X account. “Reyna will undergo his medical today.”

Gio has spent nearly his entire career in the German league, making his debut with Borussia Dortmund in 2020. Over six seasons, he made 146 appearances and scored 19 goals, including a brief loan spell with Nottingham Forest in the Premier League in 2024.

Initially, Gio Reyna was considered one of the most promising young talents in the Bundesliga, becoming the youngest American player to feature in the German league. When he debuted with Borussia Dortmund in early 2020, he was just 17 years and 66 days old, breaking the record previously set by Christian Pulisic at the same club.

In his early days as a professional, he also achieved other milestones, such as being the youngest goalscorer in German Cup history and the third-youngest player to appear in a UEFA Champions League knockout-stage match.

However, over time, the attacking midfielder struggled to live up to the high expectations placed on him, particularly when it came to transitioning from a promising youngster to an established player. Now, at nearly 23 years old and with substantial experience under his belt, the opportunity at Borussia Monchengladbach could mark a turning point in his career.

The aforementioned achievements and Giovanni Reyna's talent make him a key figure for the United States Men's National Team. That's why his pursuit of a return to top form could also greatly benefit USMNT in the near future.

Gio has won the Concacaf Nations League three times (2020, 2023, and 2024), and was named MVP of the tournament in the most recent edition. At the same time, though, he has faced setbacks in major tournaments. At the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Reyna played just 52 minutes across four matches—a situation later revealed to be due to off-field conflicts that led to a disciplinary decision by then-coach Gregg Berhalter.

The most recent example came during the 2025 Gold Cup, where Reyna was notably absent from Mauricio Pochettino's final squad, along with Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tim Weah. In this case, Gio was not released by Borussia Dortmund due to the club's participation in the FIFA Club World Cup.

When is the FIFA World Cup draw 2026? Donald Trump confirms date, venue for ceremony originally appeared on The Sporting News

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is closing in, with less than a year to go until the unprecedented event held across the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

Prior to the World Cup taking place is the draw, which will set the matchups for the group stage and prepare the knockout stage bracket for eventual filling out.

The draw is a huge event in itself, with fans of every participating nation excited to find out not just who they will play, but also when and where. The 23 host cities across the World Cup will also be eager to discover which teams will be welcomed to their venue.

With the final set for MetLife Stadium in New York, all 48 teams will be eyeing a deep run to international glory.

The draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup will take place on Dec. 5, 2025 at 12 p.m. ET.

The ceremony will be held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, situated on the banks of the Potomac River.

U.S. president Donald Trump announced the event alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino on Aug. 22 in the Oval Office.

During the announcement, Trump broke a long-held superstition that only World Cup winners should touch the World Cup trophy, handed the famed centerpiece by Infantino. “It's for winners only,” the FIFA president said before handing it to Trump. The president held for a moment before placing it down on his Oval Office desk, quipping, ""That's a beautiful piece of gold, can I keep it?""

Trump was referencing a viral moment earlier this summer when he revealed Infantino let him keep the original Club World Cup trophy.

The announcement came as a surprise, with Las Vegas considered the likely destination for the draw. According to Adam Crafton of The Athletic, the decision to hold the draw in D.C. surprised not only fans and media, but many of those within FIFA and the 2026 World Cup committee as well.

For the first time, the 2026 FIFA World Cup will feature 48 teams, necessitating a new draw format.

The group stage will consist of 12 groups of four teams each. The top two teams in each group will qualify for the knockout stage, while eight of the 12 third-place finishers will also qualify for the knockout stage.

The three co-hosts, USA, Canada, and Mexico, have all been pre-drawn into groups. The U.S. will be in Group D, Canada in Group B, and Mexico in Group A.

The draw will largely consist of the same format it has in recent years, just on a larger scale. 42 of the 48 qualifiers will be known at the time of the draw, while six teams will qualify after via the intercontinental playoffs.","{'href': 'https://ca.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'ca.sports.yahoo.com'}","soccer"

The England international was set to join Thomas Frank's rebuild, but will instead link up with Mikel Arteta at the Emirates Stadium

At the age of 27, Eberechi Eze will finally play for a 'big six' club. He is set to swap south London for north, but not for the half that many had been expecting.

Tottenham had seemingly sewn up a deal with Crystal Palace, and the player himself was keen on becoming the new face of Thomas Frank's project. Alas, he will become an Arsenal player instead, returning to his boyhood club after first being released by the Gunners at the age of 13.

It's another memorable chapter for Arsenal in their long history of making Tottenham's life a little bit more miserable. From winning the league twice at White Hart Lane to pinching Sol Campbell off them for nothing, there's nothing Gooners like more than giving their little brother at the other end of Seven Sisters Road a wedgie.

However, as much as Eze's decision to choose red over lilywhite is personal and a lifelong dream in the making, he should be wary of the pitfalls of heading to a place where he will be just another player rather than the star.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Van de Zandschulp broke Mpetshi Perricard three times, scattering six aces over the match lasting one hour and 36 minutes.

Earlier Friday, he'd put the finishing touches on a 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 quarter-final win over China's Bu Yunchaokete, which had been halted Thursday night by rain.

""It was a pretty quick two hours (between matches), but I think I managed well tonight,"" said van de Zandschulp, who will be seeking a first ATP title on Saturday in his third appearance in a final.

The Dutch player will face Marton Fucsovics in the title match. The Hungarian advanced by walkover when American Sebastian Korda withdrew because of illness.

Fucsovics is chasing a third ATP title. He lifted the trophy in Bucharest last year, six years after a triumph in Geneva.

Korda was playing his first tournament since Roland Garros because of a stress fracture in his right shin, but the 25-year-old said it wasn't the injury that prompted him to pull out.

""Woke up a bit under the weather and thought it was going to be difficult to play today,"" he said in a social media post. ""Been a long three months recovering and want to stay on track.""

The tournament is the final men's tune-up for the US Open, where singles play begins on Sunday.

Van de Zandschulp, who stunned Spanish star Carlos Alcaraz in the second round at Flushing Meadows last year, is due to launch his campaign at the final Grand Slam of the year against 11th-seeded Holger Rune.

Fucsovics will also be looking for a title to provide a pre-US Open boost. He faces Canadian Denis Shapovalov in the first round in New York, where Korda and Bu are also in the field.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz's rivalry is already one for the history books, having met 14 times on the ATP Tour.

The ATP world number one and two took their rivalry to another level in 2025, as they began contesting Grand Slam finals against each other.

In Paris, Alcaraz saved championship points to beat Sinner in the Roland Garros final, 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6.

Getting his revenge at SW19, Sinner defeated Alcaraz in four sets to clinch his maiden Wimbledon title.

Many are predicting the pair to face off once more in the US Open final next month, as they look to continue their streak of Grand Slam dominance.

Speaking to the media just days before the tournament begins, Sinner explained why Alcaraz is so difficult to beat and highlighted what sets him apart from other ATP Tour stars.

During his pre-tournament press conference, Sinner shared his thoughts on his rivalry with Alcaraz.

“Well, we are two different players, you know. I think he is obviously very fast on court,” he said.

“So, you know, with maybe other players, the point could be over at times, but he reaches certain balls, so he can read the game in a different way.

“They are already these longer rallies sometimes.

“Obviously, we know each other now better. It's a very tactical game. He prepares the match in a different way than he used to prepare it. Me and my team, we do the same.”

Sinner and Alcaraz have become very familiar with one another over recent times, playing 14 matches in four years.

It's Alcaraz who's had the better of their rivalry so far, winning nine matches to Sinner's six, and winning six of the last seven.

Knowing that he and Alcaraz are ‘different' players, Sinner will be confident of turning the tide before too long.

“We have different styles, you know, game styles, but also how we are on the court and off the court. We are just different, you know,” said Sinner.

“But at the same time, it's great to see, because it makes it very interesting. The only thing we have in common is that we practice very hard (smiling). We make choices for tennis, you know.

“It's now our first priority at the moment, which it has to be, because it's very small, small details make the difference. So it's interesting to see.”

Only time will tell if Sinner can start to pick up wins over Alcaraz on a more regular basis, but it will certainly be something to look out for.

Sinner isn't just concerned about Alcaraz, however, as he is more than aware of the challenges other players could provide over the next few years.

Sinner and Alcaraz have been dominant at the Grand Slams since the beginning of the 2024 season, sharing the previous seven majors between themselves.

While some fans are predicting a lengthy spell of dominance for the pair, Sinner isn't quite so confident.

“If we don't continue to improve, players will catch us. It's just a question of time,” he said.

“So we or what I am trying to do is to understand what I can work on. Then we have certain areas of the game, certainly, where we can work on. From my point of view, that's positive. It only makes me a better tennis player, and in the future.

“At the moment, me and Carlos, we are sharing big trophies, but at the same time, things can change.

“There are great, great players out there, and to get to the final, it's very difficult to get there, you know.

“So let's see if this continues. But on the other hand, I always say we have to improve, because players understand us now, how we are. So let's see in the future.”

In search of his fifth Grand Slam title, Sinner will begin his US Open campaign against Czechia's Vit Kopriva on Monday, August 25.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Novak Djokovic criticised his fellow players for not being willing to fight for their interests.

The Serbian co-founded the Professional Tennis Players Association, which is currently engaged in legal action against the tours, to try to give athletes more of a voice and has been a leading advocate for increased prize money and other welfare changes.

Djokovic will play his first tournament since Wimbledon at the US Open as he resumes his search for a 25th grand slam title, with the 38-year-old revealing he skipped the recent Masters 1000 events in Canada and Cincinnati because he finds them too long.

The move towards lengthening Masters tournaments to almost two weeks has not been popular with many players and fans, but Djokovic believes his competitors partly have themselves to blame.

“I support the players,” said the former world number one, who believes prize money still needs to go higher than the record 90million US dollars on offer at Flushing Meadows.

“But, in the end of the day, when the players needed to be active and when there was a time of negotiations and decision-making, players weren't participating enough.

“This is an ongoing story of the players, particularly top players. They express their feelings, but then when you really need to put in the time and the energy into conversations, meetings – which I know it's very difficult, I have been there, trust me, many times.

“But it's necessary because then you're doing something not only for yourself but future generations, and you're making the right moves, the right steps, and contributing.”

It is now two years since Djokovic won his most recent grand slam title, with this season seeing him fall in the semi-finals at all the major tournaments.

His motivation for the biggest events remains strong but other priorities have taken over.

“I'm not chasing the rankings or building up my points or defending, I just don't think about it anymore,” he said.

“For me, it's really about where do I find motivation and joy? Where will I be inspired to play the best tennis? And where do I care to be, really, and play?

“And slams are obviously the four main tournaments where I always feel the most motivation. I don't actually have any schedule other than slams, to be honest.

“I kind of like feel in the moment what I want to do and how I want to balance things out with other priorities in life, family being, of course, the main one and being there for the important dates, speaking of which I'm maybe going to miss out on my daughter's birthday.

“It's the second of September, so if I'm doing well, I'm still here. But those are types of things that I really don't want to be missing anymore.”

Djokovic finds himself once more in the position of the hunter, with Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz bidding to make it eight slam titles in a row between them.

The Serbian revealed he is rooting for a third challenger to emerge from the younger generation, just as he did when he turned Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal's duopoly into a big three.

“I think their rivalry is amazing,” said Djokovic. “What they have done in the previous two years is remarkable for both of these players.

“And then you have obviously other young players that are definitely going to challenge them, and hopefully somebody can get in the mix. I kind of empathise with the third guy, because I was in those shoes with Federer and Nadal. I want to see a third guy coming in.”

Venus Williams could become the oldest woman to win a Grand Slam match since Martina Navratilova at Wimbledon in 2004

Two-time champion Venus Williams says the love for her ""job"" is why she is back playing at the US Open at the age of 45.

At the start of this year, many wondered when the veteran American would announce her retirement.

Now she is set to grace her home Grand Slam tournament for a record-extending 25th time when she plays Czech 11th seed Karolina Muchova on Monday.

""It is super thrilling to be back. It does not get old - it just gets more exciting,"" said the seven-time major winner.

Earlier this season, Williams became officially considered an inactive player, having gone a whole year without competing.

Then, out of nowhere as the eyes of the tennis world were trained on Wimbledon, she announced she was ready to play at the Washington Open.

The former world number one won her first-round match on her first appearance in 16 months, before going out in round two.

The victory over fellow American Peyton Stearns meant Williams became the oldest player to win a WTA Tour singles match in more than 21 years.

Asked to describe the joy of being back playing, she said: ""I love my job. So there's the joy right there.""

Williams, ranked 580th in the world, is set to become the oldest US Open singles player in 44 years after being given a wildcard for Flushing Meadows.

It will be her first appearance at one of the four majors since the 2023 US Open, where she lost in the first round.

Some argue giving a spot in the 128-player draw to a veteran with one victory in more than two years blocks the development of a younger player.

Others will say an all-time great should always be offered the chance to turn out.

It could be her final appearance at a tournament where she is revered by the New York crowd.

Sister Serena bowed out of professional tennis at the 2022 US Open, reaching the third round with a short run that captured the imagination of the sporting world.

Typically, Venus Williams gave little away in her pre-tournament news conference about what the future may hold.

""I think I'll always play tennis. It's in my DNA. So it doesn't matter if it's now or 30 years from now,"" she said.

""Tennis will always be one of the most important parts of my life.""

 It's a given that much of the coverage and attention devoted to Venus Williams' return to the U.S. Open, where play begins Sunday, has focused — and will focus — on how old she is. The American is, after all, 45, an age at which no one has competed in singles in New York since 1981.

That, in and of itself, is noteworthy.

And yet there is plenty more that is significant about her first appearance at a Grand Slam tournament in two full years, regardless of how Williams plays in Arthur Ashe Stadium on Monday night when meets Karolina Muchova, the 2023 French Open runner-up and a two-time semifinalist in New York.

All of this is happening shortly after Williams made it back to the tour at all, 16 months after playing an official match anywhere and less than a year after she had surgery for uterine fibroids.

 Venus Williams is at a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in 2 years 

“It's just really, I would say, inspiring,” said Naomi Osaka, 27, a four-time Grand Slam champion. “My only thing is: I don't really like how every headline mentions her age. ... We all know how old she is. But it's kind of more the broader (significance) — how much of a legend she is in this sport.""

Williams and her younger sister Serena whose last match as a pro came at Flushing Meadows in 2022, represent an indelible chapter in the history of tennis, yes, but also of sports in a greater sense and even American society.

They transcended the mere scores and stats and win-and-loss ledgers, and made it all about far more than that, including Venus' famous stand in favor of equal prize money for women at Wimbledon.

“She's one of the best athletes of all time,” two-time U.S. Open semifinalist Frances Tiafoe said. “Her and her sister, they're not only great for the women's game, not only great for women's sports, but they are so iconic.”

 Venus and Serena Williams are sisters who both reached the top of tennis 

Their story bears repeating: Two siblings were first taught tennis by their self-taught father and both not only made it to the professional tour but both reached No. 1 in the rankings and won the most important trophies in their global sport.

“People, I guess,” Osaka said, “should value them a little bit more.”

Osaka grew up watching the Williams sisters, then competed against them.

So did plenty of other women, such as Coco Gauff, who first announced herself to the world by defeating Venus at Wimbledon in 2019. After that match, Gauff — just 15 at the time — said she thanked Venus “for everything she did,” and told reporters: “I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her.”

 Venus was the first Black woman since Althea Gibson to win Wimbledon 

In 2000, Venus became the first Black woman since Althea Gibson in the 1950s to win the championship at the All England Club.

“She's (had) a huge impact. ... It's so cool to see a legend still playing, still doing what she loves,” 2021 U.S. Open runner-up Leylah Fernandez said. “It's not, kind of, to prove people wrong, but it's because she truly loves the sport — and you can see the kid in her. I love that.""

Indeed, asked why she would bother playing, Williams replied: “Why not?”

 Venus Williams owns 23 Grand Slam trophies in singles and doubles 

Williams collected five singles trophies at Wimbledon and also won the U.S. Open in 2000 and 2001. That's aside from 14 Grand Slam titles in women's doubles — all with Serena — and two in mixed doubles, an event she returned to at Flushing Meadows this week.

Since the Williams sisters came on the scene — Venus made her professional debut in 1994, when she was 14; Serena, who is 15 months younger, would soon follow and ended up with 23 major singles titles — they set an example for kids who looked like them and wanted to play tennis.

Last month in Washington, Williams took pride in noticing that there were three Black women competing on the court when she played — and won, by the way — a doubles match during the first event of her comeback.

“It's amazing that now African-American girls know they can play tennis, that that's an option, an opportunity for them to be out there, too, on the court, in whatever capacity,” she said, “whether you get to the pros, whether you play college or whether you just learn from the sport.”

If you would like to follow The Athletic's U.S. Open coverage, click here and follow our tennis page. 

Will world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka go “Slamless” in 2025 — and does it even matter?

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner could go eight from eight at the Grand Slams — but their bigger fight might take place in the world rankings.

Is Coco Gauff sacrificing her home major for her greater tennis good?

And does this U.S. Open, with its mixed doubles title already handed out, herald the end of the majors as the tennis world has known them for so long?

The 2025 U.S. Open promises to be a cracker. Here, The Athletic's tennis writers, Matt Futterman and Charlie Eccleshare, chart some of the key storylines to follow over the next fortnight.

Sabalenka has had a hell of a season. She made the final of the Australian and French Opens and the semifinals at Wimbledon. She won the Miami and Madrid Opens. She made the final of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif. and the Stuttgart Grand Prix in Germany. She's first in the “Race” to the WTA Tour finals.

But she's still missing the one thing she really wants, which is to win a Grand Slam. She'd also like to finish the year as the world No. 1. But she has one more chance for that elusive major, and Iga Świątek is hot on her heels at the top of the rankings.

The positives are that she is the defending champion at the U.S. Open, and she has won three of the last five hard-court majors. Her Grand Slam record this year speaks to going deep reliably as much as missing out at the last. But she has also eked out a lot of wins through tiebreaks — tiebreaks which became tiebreaks because she had to recover from her serve being broken, not because both players held. Only two of the 19 sets Sabalenka has played in 2025 that ended in tiebreaks have not featured a break.

“If this goal is not going to be achieved, I'll still think that this season has been really amazing for me,” she said in her pre-tournament news conference.

“All of those tough lessons that I learned this season are only going to make me stronger for the next one. I'll work even harder in the preseason to make sure next year is going to be only a year of success, like truly success.”

The “Slamless” world No. 1 is a tennis archetype that refuses to budge even though it ultimately means little. Sabalenka appears to be aware of that — but she will also be desperate to make sure that she does not fill it.






Matt Futterman

Having never had a match between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, let alone a final, the U.S. Open won't be taking anything for granted when it comes to a potential meeting between Alcaraz and Sinner in two weeks' time.

If the world's two best men's players do contest their third Grand Slam final in a row, it would be the first time it has ever happened on the ATP Tour in the same calendar year; Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic faced each other in four straight finals across 2011 and 2012. Sinner and Alcaraz met in a final as recently as this week, but their Cincinnati Open contest was cut short in the first set with the Italian feeling unwell.

What's especially worrying for the rest of the field is that each time these two play each other, they each elevate the other a bit more and create ever-increasing distance from their peers. The other especially worrying thing is that they have another major milestone on the line: the world No. 1 ranking. If Alcaraz betters Sinner's result in New York, he will assume the world No. 1 ranking, having lost it to Sinner last year despite beating his nearest rival in all three of their meetings that year.

And they appear aware of the task at hand. “If we don't continue to improve, players will catch us,” Sinner said in a news conference Friday. “It's just a question of time.”

After winning all of the previous seven majors between them, it still doesn't look like happening anytime soon.

Charlie Eccleshare

Focussing on process rather than results is one if the biggest cliches in sports and life. As cliches go, it's not a bad one to follow.

Gauff became a walking billboard for it this week, when she switched technical coaches and embarked on the process of changing her serve just days before the start of her home Slam, which is arguably her most important tournament of the year.

Her new coach, Gavin MacMillan, achieved pretty fast results with Sabalenka three years ago when he worked with her. Her double faults dropped into the single digits from the neighborhood of 20 within a few weeks.

That doesn't mean that will happen for Gauff. She knows that.

“I'm looking at long-term,” Gauff said Friday. “I hope I can get it all together.” She knew she needed to make a change, even if that meant potentially sacrificing this tournament while she tries to learn on the fly.

“I don't want to waste time continuing to do the wrong things,” she said.

Matt Futterman



With every passing Grand Slam, the sandwich generation of 1990s-born players led by Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas seems to slip further and further away from genuine contention. Zverev, as the world No. 3, is slightly separate from this, but for Tsitsipas and Medvedev, it's been a miserable year. Especially at the Grand Slams, where they have two match wins between them in 2025.

Tsitsipas is battling an ongoing back injury and has given worrying quotes about how much it's affecting him, while Medvedev has looked hopelessly underpowered for much of the year.

Zverev said Friday that consideration has to be given to external factors when assessing a player's form, and that he expects both Medvedev and Tsitsipas to work their way back into the world's top 10. At present, though, the most likely genuine challengers to Sinner and Alcaraz would appear to be the players younger than them rather than the lost boys of men's tennis.

The U.S. Open mixed doubles event this week scored a big victory for the event in the Grand Slam arms race. There were gripes with the format and the lack of proper doubles players, but generally the event made plenty of dollars and headlines.

It was the first topic raised with Emma Raducanu in her news conference Friday, and she instantly suggested the other majors should follow suit. “Yeah, I think it would be so fun if all the slams got involved and did something similar, even if it was not the exact same format.

“I think it was a huge success.”

Of the remaining three, the French Open currently has no plans to alter its mixed-doubles format, while Wimbledon, typically the most traditional of the slams, looks unlikely to follow the U.S. Open's lead. The All England Lawn Tennis Club did not respond to a request for comment; nor did Tennis Australia, whose flagship event, the Australian Open, has tended to be the most innovative of the slams.

That said, every other slam from here on in, including the U.S. Open, can refine and rework the mixed-doubles event from the last week to make it an even more compelling package. Gauff, for instance, said in a news conference Friday that she very much enjoyed the event, but that it would benefit from more actual doubles teams.

The only proper doubles team taking part, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, retained their title by outclassing the singles stars brought in for the show.

This tournament is notorious for its late finishes. It markets it and celebrates it. When matches finish in the small hours of the morning and players get to sleep as the sun is rising, it's talked about as an epic event, regardless of how bad it is for the people competing for one of the biggest prizes in their sport or any other.

This generally happens during the night sessions on the stadium courts, when two matches take place but don't start before 7 p.m. When a men's match goes more than four hours or a women's match goes more than three, the tournament has a Late Finishing Match policy, which it introduced last year. If a match isn't likely to start before 11:15 p.m., tournament officials have claimed the right to move it into or out of Louis Armstrong or Arthur Ashe Stadiums.

That doesn't mean they will. As the first weekend of last year's U.S. Open ticked from Sunday night into Monday morning, Zheng Qinwen and Donna Vekic set a record for the latest-finishing women's match in U.S. Open history, with Zheng closing out match point at 2:15 a.m. That was just a few minutes later than the finish time for Sabalenka and Ekaterina Alexandrova's third-round match earlier in the first week. That had been down on the Friday, but started very early Saturday morning, at 12:08 a.m. It was the latest-starting match in U.S. Open history.

They will talk to the players about it and take their opinions into consideration, but don't have to follow them. Other factors include the pace of play in the match that is going long and delaying the following one, the status of the match and other factors.

What does that mean? Probably some more late nights at the U.S. Open.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Scouting Report: Sinner's US Open title defence endangered by Alcaraz, Djokovic","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/us-open-2025-scouting-report","Sat, 23 Aug 2025 16:52:06 GMT","

At the season's final major, Jannik Sinner will aim to become just the seventh man in the Open Era to win three Grand Slam titles in the same year.

The top seed and defending US Open champion remains unbeaten at the hard-court majors since 2023, but he will face fierce competition from the likes of rival Carlos Alcaraz, four-time winner Novak Djokovic and former finalist Alexander Zverev.

Other contenders for the US Open include last year's runner-up Taylor Fritz, British No. 1 Jack Draper, in-form American Ben Shelton and plenty more.

ATPTour.com looks at 10 storylines to look out for at Flushing Meadows.

1) Sinner's pursuit of triple-major season: Despite retiring ill against Alcaraz in their Cincinnati final last week, Sinner will begin his title defence full of confidence, having claimed the past three hard-court major titles. With triumphs this year at the Australian Open and Wimbledon, the World No. 1 could become the seventh man in the Open Era to win three major crowns in one season.

Sinner owns a 31-4 tour-level record this season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He first plays Vit Kopriva and is seeded to meet Draper in the quarter-finals.

2) Alcaraz eyes World No. 1 takeover: With a Tour-leading 54 wins and six titles in 2025, Alcaraz will aim to continue his impressive season at the US Open, which could have huge implications on the PIF ATP Rankings. Alcaraz was stunned in the second round by Botic van de Zandschulp last year and will start 50 points ahead of defending champion Sinner in the Live Rankings this year. 

If the 2022 US Open champion goes further in the tournament than Sinner, he is guaranteed to reclaim the World No. 1 spot for the first time since September 2023.

3) Djokovic's charge for record 25th major: Djokovic returns to tour-level action for the first time since reaching the Wimbledon semi-finals five weeks ago and is chasing a record 25th major title, and first since he won in New York in 2023. The Serbian has reached the last four at all three Grand Slam tournaments this year, retiring against Zverev in Melbourne before losing to Sinner in straight sets at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

At seventh, Djokovic is at his lowest US Open seeding since his second appearance in 2006. The 38-year-old, who leads Alcaraz 5-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, could meet the Spaniard in the semi-finals.

4) Can Zverev go one step further at a Slam? A three-time major finalist, Zverev suffered heartbreaking five-set losses to Dominic Thiem at the 2020 US Open and to Alcaraz at Roland Garros last year before falling to Sinner in three in the Australian Open final in January.

Zverev has reached at least the quarter-finals in each of his past four appearances in New York and arrives this year after consecutive semi-final runs in Toronto and Cincinnati.

5) Shelton, Ruud, Medvedev lurking in Alcaraz's quarter: If Alcaraz is to strengthen his chances of winning a second US Open title, he will first have to navigate a testing quarter, which features 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev, 2022 runner-up Casper Ruud and this month's Toronto titlist Ben Shelton.

Medvedev, who is seeded to face Alcaraz in the fourth round, has proven himself against the Spaniard at Flushing Meadows in the past, notably prevailing in their four-set semi-final in 2023. Ruud is currently 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and will aim to bolster his chances of qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals with a deep run in New York.

A standout performer of the North American hard-court swing so far, Shelton returns to his home major riding a strong run of form. The 22-year-old boasts an 11-3 tour-level record in the past month, highlighted by winning his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Toronto and thus rising to a career-high World No. 6. He is projected to meet Alcaraz in the quarter-finals.

6) Top 10 threats: Last year's runner-up Fritz became the first American to reach the US Open championship match since 2006 and the home favourite will return with expectation. The 27-year-old won two grass-court titles and reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon this year before backing it up with a run to the last four in Toronto.

British No. 1 Draper was a surprise semi-finalist at Flushing Meadows in 2024 but is now an established player at the top of the game. In March, he won his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Indian Wells, where he stunned Alcaraz in the semi-finals, but he is yet to compete since his shock second-round defeat to Marin Cilic at Wimbledon.

Different Drama: Jack Draper wins Indian Wells

Washington champion Alex de Minaur, Toronto finalist Karen Khachanov and World No. 10 Lorenzo Musetti are all players to look out for in New York.

7) Teen talents: Miami champion Jakub Mensik leads a charge of teenage talents aiming to make their mark at the US Open. The 19-year-old Czech, who reached the third round in his two prior appearances, is joined by 19-year-old Brazilian Joao Fonseca and 19-year-old American Learner Tien.

The 2023 US Open boys' singles champion, Fonseca won his first ATP Tour title in Buenos Aires in February and will make his main-draw debut in New York this week. Tien, who stunned Medvedev at the Australian Open in January, faces Djokovic in the first round.

8) Year-End No. 1 battle heats up: After winning his eighth ATP Masters 1000 trophy in Cincinnati, Alcaraz has taken a 1,890-point lead over Sinner in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin. The Italian will aim to reduce that deficit in New York as he aims to retain his Year-End ATP No. 1 presented by PIF honours.



9) First-round matches to watch: Alexander Bublik, who has captured three tour-level titles during the European summer swing, faces a stern test against former champion Marin Cilic in his first appearance of the North American hard-court swing. Musetti also faces a challenge against big-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in his opener, while Wimbledon quarter-finalist Cameron Norrie starts against American Sebastian Korda. 

10) Cash/Glasspool eye second major in 2025: Despite seeing their 22-match tour-level winning streak come to an end in the Cincinnati semi-finals, Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool arrive at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings. The British stars, who triumphed at Wimbledon, have already qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals.

Iconic Nico Rosberg onboards

After dropping off the F1 grid last year, Daniel Ricciardo is gradually telling more stories from his career.

Daniel Ricciardo has revealed the story behind the ‘Honey Badger' nickname he took on during his time in Formula 1, explaining that the animal represented his “alter ego” whenever he jumped into the cockpit.

Found across Africa, Southwest Asia and the Indian subcontinent, the honey badger is famous for its aggression, strength and toughness, with skin so thick that it can withstand various stings and bites.

Speaking in an interview at Ray White's Connect conference in Australia earlier this month, Ricciardo shared how his relaxed nature off the track, mixed with his hunger to succeed on it, led to the amusing label being adopted.

“Honey badgers are cuddly and cute, super good-looking,” he began with a laugh. “But when something takes what's theirs, they fight back, and I think that was sort of like my alter ego when I got behind the wheel.”

Given his easy-going ways, Ricciardo admitted that he had to work hard on extracting that alter ego, or “killer instinct”, as his F1 career developed.

“I have had a competitor in me since when I was a kid; I was always competitive in everything I did,” he commented. “But the killer instinct I needed to develop and work on extracting it out of myself. I'm naturally more easy-going.

“One of my first trainers at the time, Stu Smith, he really brought it out of me. I did have to work at it, but when I let it out it did feel kinda nice – it's nice to be a badass sometimes.

“I would use too much energy trying to be tough all the time because it's not natural for me. I would see other drivers who had that killer instinct from morning to night and I wished I could be like them.

“I think people would see me laughing and joking, and they would see that as weakness and underestimate me. But I would put the helmet on and think, ‘Okay, now it's time to be tough like the others'.”

Ricciardo's killer instinct was perhaps best represented through overtaking – the Australian catching the eye with an array of late lunges and bold passes across his career.

“There's a lot of drivers who could go on the track by themselves and be fast, but go on the track with 20 others and it's about race craft, and overtaking is a big part of that,” he emphasised.

“It becomes quite scary because there's some unpredictability and risk involved. You might be in third place and think, ‘Well, I've got a podium, do I need to risk crashing?', but it's the most fun, and I always thought it was better to crash than not try.

“It got to a point [where] to me it was just instinct. You accept that if it doesn't work you can be proud that you gave it a crack. I loved it, and I felt like the competitors would see me coming and knew I'd have a go, so I was already one step ahead.”

Ricciardo recently opened up about his journey of “self-exploration” since leaving the F1 world, with the 36-year-old “trying to figure out who I am” beyond racing.

In just under a decade-and-a-half as an F1 driver, he amassed 257 starts, three pole positions, eight victories, 32 podium finishes and more than 1,300 points, while representing HRT, Toro Rosso (later AlphaTauri/RB), Red Bull, Renault and McLaren.

THR calls balls and strikes on the actors who deserve an MVP award for their athletic prowess onscreen — and those who needed a little more time in the minors.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	Sports stories are a staple of the movie and TV business for a reason: They usually have clear stakes, inherent drama and easily identifiable heroes and villains, giving audiences characters to root for (and against). But with a handful of exceptions, actors in sports movies and series don't always have athletic backgrounds, at least not at the level of the characters they're portraying. 


	Rigorous training ahead of the cameras rolling can help, as can editing and other tricks of the trade, but not everyone can pull off the level of athleticism needed for audiences to fully suspend their disbelief. Here are some of the best, and a few of the worst, athletic performances in movies and TV.


	Maybe the most credible onscreen ballplayer of the past 40 years, both as a catcher who was just below the cusp of major-league talent in Bull Durham and an aging pitcher in the midst of a perfect game in For the Love of the Game. (Costner's golf game in Tin Cup is also pretty solid.)


ALL-STAR OR AMATEUR? All-star


	The stars of Luca Guadagnino's movie Challengers, about a love triangle set in the professional tennis world, trained on the court for a good while before filming — but behind-the-scenes clips and other breakdowns of the movie make it clear they weren't actually hitting a ball in many of the tennis scenes.


ALL-STARS OR AMATEURS? Amateurs 




	Geena Davis is the star of A League of Their Own, but Petty's performance as the overlooked younger sister stands out, particularly in the baseball scenes. Her swing, throwing motion and baserunning form are all a cut above those of her co-stars.


ALL-STAR OR AMATEUR? All-star 


	The composition and editing of the Creed films' fight scenes do a great job of putting viewers within the action, but all of that wouldn't work nearly as well if Jordan (who also played a talented high school quarterback on NBC's Friday Night Lights) didn't showcase fast hands and good form in the ring.


ALL-STAR OR AMATEUR? All-star


	Oliver Stone's gonzo football movie Any Given Sunday is maybe not the most realistic depiction of the sport ever put on film. But as benchwarmer turned starter Willie Beamen, Foxx — a high school quarterback in his home state of Texas — does his best to ground the frenetic action with a smooth throwing motion and some real athleticism.


ALL-STAR OR AMATEUR? All-star


	Swank won an Oscar for playing an up-and-coming boxer who meets a tragic end in the ring in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby. She reportedly trained extensively to play a fighter, and it shows in her footwork and fighting style. 


ALL-STAR OR AMATEUR? All-star


	There's no arguing with the (onscreen) results of Happy Gilmore's unorthodox approach to hitting a golf ball, taken from the character's days as a hockey player. But there's a reason no one on the professional tours swings like that. 


ALL-STAR OR AMATEUR? Amateur 


	Most of the actors playing footballers in Ted Lasso had been on a pitch before, and while no one would ever mistake the in-game action on the show for a real Premier League match, the cast held its own. Among the standouts was Fernández, who signed with a professional club in Mexico as a teenager but turned to acting after a knee injury. His skills remained with him, and they showed in his portrayal of Dani “Fútbol Is Life” Rojas.


ALL-STAR OR AMATEUR? All-star


	Although both are less than 6 feet tall, Snipes and Harrelson showed some real basketball skill as playground hoops hustlers in Ron Shelton's 1992 cult favorite White Men Can't Jump. Maybe not enough to actually get the better of former UCLA great and NBA All-Star Marques Johnson (who played the hotheaded Raymond in a memorable scene), but more than enough to sell the movie's conceit.


ALL-STARS OR AMATEURS? All-stars 


	The boorish (but hilarious) Al Czervik is supposed to be terrible at golf, so by that standard, Dangerfield nails his Caddyshack performance. Even to an untrained eye, Al's swing is atrocious.


All-star or amateur? Amateur, on purpose


The Bad News Bears and Bull Durham are among the best baseball movies, but not necessarily because of how well they depicted on-field play. These two actors played minor league pitchers (or ex-pitcher, in the case of Matthau's Morris Buttermaker) who somehow got near the cusp of the big leagues despite obviously terrible mechanics. Robbins' Nuke LaLoosh in Bull Durham had a “million-dollar arm but a five-cent head,” and his delivery wasn't much better than the latter. The less said about Buttermaker's briefly seen pitching in The Bad News Bears, the better.

Senior Editor, Latin


From career milestones to new music releases to major announcements and those little important moments, Billboard editors highlight uplifting moments in Latin music. Here's what happened in the Latin music world this week.


	Argentine singer-songwriter Maria Becerra has made acting debut on Netflix's new series En El Barro, the spin-off of the series El Marginal, produced by Netflix and Underground, a division of Telemundo Studios. Becerra, who also performs the series official song, “7 Vidas,” steps into the role of Cleo, “a young woman from the neighborhood who falls in love and faces motherhood while struggling to keep her child close in the midst of extreme circumstances,” according to an official description of her character. “Through this character, Maria portrays the fight for motherhood and the sacrifices made under adverse conditions.” The series is now streaming on Netflix — watch the trailer below:

	The ceremony will take place on Sept. 4 at the Warner Theater in Washington, D.C., and will air nationally on PBS. Rauw Alejandro was previously announced as the 2025 Hispanic Heritage Award honoree for Vision.


	DY is set to speak at the 2025 Billboard Latin Music Week, slated to run Oct. 20–24 at the Fillmore Miami Beach. The Puerto Rican superstar will lead the panel titled “The Power of Reinvention,” where the hitmaker will open up about his “legendary career, the evolution of his artistry, and how he is shaping his next chapter,” according to a press release. 

	











	Latin Music Week will feature panels, live performances, workshops, and networking events, wrapping up with a special celebration concert on Oct. 24.

Plus, Thomas Rhett's ""After All the Bars Are Closed"" leads Country Airplay for a third week.

Morgan Wallen banks his 21st top 10 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart (dated Aug. 30) as “I Got Better” hops three spots to No. 10. It increased by 18% to 16 million audience impressions Aug. 15-21, according to Luminate.


	Wallen co-wrote the song with ERNEST, HARDY, Chase McGill, Blake Pendergrass and Ryan Vojtesak. Joey Moi produced it.

	











	The single is Wallen's fifth top 10 from his LP I'm the Problem, which has led Top Country Albums for 13 straight weeks since it opened atop the May 31-dated survey with 493,000 equivalent album units earned. The 37-song blockbuster has also dominated the all-format Billboard 200 for 11 weeks.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I Got Better” follows four Country Airplay No. 1s from the set: “Just in Case” (four weeks); the title track (eight); “Love Somebody” (three); and “Lies Lies Lies” (one week).


	Notably, nearly two-thirds of the way through 2025, Wallen, with three Country Airplay No. 1s this year, has a chance to tie his own record: In 2024, he became the first artist to roll up five leaders in a single year since the list launched in 1990: “Lies Lies Lies”; “Cowgirls” (featuring ERNEST); “Man Made a Bar” (featuring Eric Church); and Post Malone's “I Had Some Help” and Thomas Rhett's “Mamaw's House,” both featuring Wallen.

	











	Currently on tour, Wallen will make his debut at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., on Aug. 22-23 with featured acts Miranda Lambert, Corey Kent and Zach John King.


	Thomas Rhett's “After All the Bars Are Closed” controls Country Airplay for a third week (32.9 million, up 8%).


	The Rhett co-write, his 21st career No. 1, becomes his third to lead for three or more weeks. His longest reigning No. 1 is “Die a Happy Man,” which ran up a six-week command in 2016. He first logged a multiweek run at the summit with his first leader, “It Goes Like This,” for three weeks in 2013.


	All charts dated Aug. 30 will update on Billboard.com Tuesday, Aug. 26.

""I still can't believe you wrote such a beautiful song and named it my name!"" the actress remarked.

	Hannah Dailey



	The party is never over for SZA and Drew Barrymore, who continue to support each other years after the former named a song after the latter.


	In a sweet Instagram post Thursday (Aug. 21), the actress shared a throwback selfie of herself and the Grammy winner on the set of the “Drew Barrymore” music video, which SZA released in 2017. In the snap, both women wear coats while standing on a path lined with buildings, smiling softly at the camera.


	“Throwback to this ‘pinch me' moment,” Barrymore wrote in her caption. “I still can't believe you wrote such a beautiful song and named it my name! I'm the luckiest girl in the world! You're the greatest.”

	











	The post comes more than eight years after the R&B hitmaker released “Drew Barrymore” as the lead single off her debut album, Ctrl, which reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200. Though the track never charted on the Billboard Hot 100, it has steadily become known as a quintessential SZA song and a favorite among fans.




			Trending on Billboard		







	And during an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show in January, the singer — who finished the European leg of her ongoing Grand National Tour with Kendrick Lamar earlier in August — finally got to explain the reasoning for the track's title to Barrymore herself. “[Growing up,] one of the few lovely white women that I looked up to so much on television was you, because you were so yourself,” SZA told the talk-show host at the time. “You were quirky. Your smile wasn't perfect … I love the way you talk and the you-ness of you.” 


	“It just reminds me of all the things about myself that make me nervous, but on you, shine so brightly,” SZA added on the show. “It gave me permission to be myself.”

	











	During their chat, the two women also reflected on shooting the “Drew Barrymore” music video together.  Barrymore only appears in the visual for a moment, but it's powerful; as SZA collects herself while sitting on an outdoor staircase, the former child star walks past and gives her a reassuring smile.


	“I was just so excited to show up for you,” Barrymore recalled at the time, to which SZA replied, “I couldn't believe you did that.”

	As James Gunn brings Peacemaker into his new DCU with Season 2, he's clearing up some canonical confusion for fans.


	Following this week's season premiere ‘The Ties That Grind', the DC Studios boss explained that he doesn't plan to retcon Season 1, despite subbing in Isabela Merced‘s Hawkgirl and Nathan Fillion‘s Green Lantern for two DCEU characters featured in the first season finale.


	“No, unfortunately I'd have to change too many little things throughout Season 1, and it would cost too much money,” he told TV Insider. “And I'd rather just give that money to a few more CGI shots of superheroes.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“But I think that we deal with it. We say, canon is really Creature Commandos, Superman, Peacemaker Season 2. I'd love for people to watch Season 1. Obviously, we're changing that one thing, but we're not gonna go back and reshoot all of it for Season 1, at least not at this point.”


	Gunn continued, “At some point, I'd love to [George] Lucas the shit out of it, but right now I don't have the money.” The Star Wars franchise has not been shy with retconning in the past, most notably changing Anakin Skywalker's Force ghost at the end of Return of the Jedi (1983) to Hayden Christensen in the 2004 DVD release, keeping it consistent with 2005's Revenge of the Sith.


	The Season 1 finale of Peacemaker features John Cena‘s titular vigilante and his team walking away from an extraterrestrial battle as the silhouettes of DCEU's Justice League arrived, including Superman (Henry Cavill), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and The Flash (Ezra Miller). The scene even featured Aquaman having a brief exchange with The Flash about Peacemaker telling the former to “go f*** another fish.”

	











	As the Season 2 premiere recreated the scene to bring Hawkgirl and Green Lantern into the episode, with the latter complaining that Peacemaker has spread a rumor he's a “puke freak,” they were joined by the silhouettes of David Corenswet's Superman, Supergirl (Milly Alcock) and Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi).


	Merced and Fillion appear in another scene, alongside Justice Gang sponsor Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn), as Peacemaker auditions for the group of heroes.

It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia wrapped up its 17th season this week, ending its latest run with an extended tribute to its beautifully grotesque elder statesman, Danny DeVito‘s Frank Reynolds. That also means DeVito has been making the interview rounds, including revealing a recent prank war he got into with his fellow cast members—one that saw him briefly threaten to call his lawyer, before proceeding to do his best to give as good as he got.

Talking to THR, DeVito was asked if he's ever balked at anything that the show's creators have asked him to do—a gamut of indignities that starts with “emerging, greased up and naked, from a couch-womb,” and just kind of expands out from there—and says there was only one. Reiterating a story he also told in the run-up to the season, DeVito says that, one fine April morning, he was preparing to film the first episode of one of the show's seasons, only to be told that series creators Rob Mac, Charlie Day, and Glenn Howerton had decided to change directions and send over a new script for him. Said new script contained much of the typical It's Always Sunny bar-based shenanigans—except for the Frank plotline, which involved DeVito's character being arrested, beaten, and repeatedly sexually assaulted while in prison. Which is, y'know, pretty dark, even for Sunny. “Midway through,” DeVito recalls, “I said, ‘I'm not going to do this. There's no way I can do this. This is really crazy.'” He said he was on the verge of calling his lawyer when he got to the script's final page, which ends with one of the abusive cops in question threatening one more assault, before whispering “April Fools, motherfucker” in Frank's ear—at which point, DeVito realized he'd been handed the new script on April 1.

According to DeVito (who has some past prank experience), he did at least get his co-workers back, albeit in a way that sounds a little less bleak than “We're going to make you pretend to be raped and beaten on national TV.” DeVito recounts to THR that, at the show's next appearance at FX's Upfronts, he “got there early, and we all had rooms that FX had given us on our own, so I talked to the manager, and I said, ‘Look, don't give them their rooms. Give me a small room with one bedroom and get me a bunch of cots and tell them that the place is filled.' The guy did it and he played it to the hilt. They were all in the room, and I was in a closet with a bottle of tequila and glasses watching them react to the fact that this guy is telling them there's no room in this hotel and this is the room that FX booked for them and they all had to sleep together on cots.” In a moment we really wish had been filmed, Rob Mac was apparently about to get on his phone to complain to the “big shots” about the treatment. (It's pretty easy to imagine, right?) But DeVito was merciful, choosing that point to emerge from the closet to reveal the prank. “I had 'em good,” he happily notes. “They did deserve it.”

Donald Trump's administration now intends to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man it unlawfully sent to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, to Uganda — after he refused a plea deal, was released from jail, and was allowed to return to his family.


	“We are not going to stop coming after him,” a senior Trump administration official tells Rolling Stone. “If this criminal wanted amnesty, he should have prayed for Kamala to win. She didn't. President Trump did… He isn't getting away.”


	By its own actions, the Trump administration has made Abrego Garcia a public symbol of its cruel and inhumane treatment of migrants. As Abrego Garcia and his family have racked up victories, big and small, against Trump in court, the administration has lashed out with increasing intensity.


	Multiple sources familiar with the matter say that several top Trump officials, including White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, believe that if Abrego Garcia and his legal team were to score a sustainable legal victory, it would be a significant blow to the Trump administration's immigration agenda — and therefore Abrego Garcia cannot be allowed to win. In recent weeks, several contingency plans were developed for different ways to punish or deport him, to try to ensure that any individual court victory Abrego Garcia might secure would be met with a trap door.

	











	In March, Trump unlawfully sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, where the Maryland father says he was tortured, in defiance of a court order barring his deportation there. For two months, the administration disregarded a Supreme Court order demanding his return, before suddenly bringing him back to the U.S. to face new alien smuggling charges in Tennessee. 

	











	With that Tennessee case faltering, Trump officials apparently gave Abrego Garcia a disturbing choice. If he pled guilty, once his sentence is complete, he could go to Costa Rica, which would offer him refugee status or residency. Beat Trump in court again, and Trump would pull the rug out from under him and send him to Uganda, a country the State Department says Americans should reconsider traveling to due to threats of terrorism and violent crime.

	After the Tennessee court let Abrego Garcia out of jail on Friday and allowed him to return home to his family in Maryland, Trump officials quickly announced their intent to deport him to Uganda, even though the criminal case remains ongoing. On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security told Abrego Garcia's lawyers that he could be sent to Uganda in a matter of days. 


	“We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country,” Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a statement on Friday. In the statement she also called him a “monster.”


	Abrego Garcia rejected part of the Trump Justice Department's plea deal on Saturday, according to the Associated Press. 


	The lawyers called the choice the government gave him “coercive,” adding that there is “little doubt that the entire federal government is engaged in a coordinated effort to punish Mr. Abrego for fighting back against its unlawful conduct.” They have also called the treatment “prosecutorial misconduct.” 


	“Heightening the constitutional concern, the government has engaged in these tactics through two agencies — DOJ and DHS — that it has previously represented were ‘separate agenc[ies] with separate leadership [and] separate direction' that could not control one another,” the lawyers wrote. “But these two agencies are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world. It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”

	The Trump administration, in what it's claimed was an “administrative error,” wrongfully deported Abrego Garcia to prison in El Salvador for three months, where he was severely beaten and psychologically tortured, according to his lawyers. 


	The Maryland resident and father of three came from El Salvador to the U.S. in 2011, and in 2019 he was given protection from deportation because he would face gang violence. 

	











	While the Tennessee court previously ordered Abrego Garcia's release on bail, he remained in jail for some time because his attorneys worried that the Trump administration would try to deport him again, this time to a third-party country, if he was freed. An immigration official said in July that officials might send him to Mexico or South Sudan. 


	On Thursday, the country of Uganda agreed to accept deported migrants who do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

	“The agreement is in respect of third country nationals who may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin,” Bagiire Vincent Waiswa, permanent secretary of Uganda's foreign ministry said.


	The prospect of deportations to Uganda “runs afoul of international law,” human rights lawyer Nicholas Opio told the AP on Thursday. “We are sacrificing human beings for political expediency; in this case, because Uganda wants to be in the good books of the United States. That I can keep your prisoners if you pay me; how is that different from human trafficking?”

	The night after J'ouvert, the pinnacle of Grenada's annual carnival, I cried and cried. All over the Caribbean and throughout its diaspora, the consecutive days of reverie known as carnival or mas are traditions rooted in African ancestral connection and resistance to colonization and slavery. This weekend, Londoners will celebrate Notting Hill Carnival, a multi-cultural evocation of Caribbean heritage maintained by their large West Indian immigrant community. On Labor Day, New Yorkers will do the same in Brooklyn. At a distance, the staunch political history of carnival can be easy to overlook on Instagram feeds full of beautiful Black people clad in feathers and rhinestones or neon paint and charcoal. But on the ground for Grenada's carnival – dubbed Spicemas for the island's trove of nutmeg, mace, cloves, and cinnamon – that legacy of rebellion is inescapable. 


	By 3:30 AM J'ouvert morning – a time named for the French colonizers' term for dawn – I was up, slipping on some basketball shorts and a sports bra that I knew could be tossed out. I wrapped my shower-capped hair in a long black scarf that could go too. For J'ouvert, Grenadians “play”  – in the customary nomenclature – Jab Jab, a centuries old tradition of blackening their skin with molasses and tar (or, more recently, motor oil or sustainable charcoal oil), donning horned helmets, and parading to their distinct sub-genre of soca music. Post-emancipation, it became a satirical take on the way white masters saw Black folks – as subhuman and grotesque – and reflect the horrors of slavery back to them. The term Jab Jab itself comes from the French term for devil. Though Grenada's Jab Jab is distinct, it's a ritual that spans the West Indies, where Caribbeans marched to say, “You think I'm a Black demon? I'll show you a Black demon.”

	When my travel group of journalists and influencers – sponsored by the Grenada Tourism Authority and its media partners – made it to the busy downtown streets just before sunrise, the roads were flush with youth throwing flames into the air with lighters and cans of bug spray and dragging chains like the ones that tethered their ancestors to ships across the Middle Passage. They jumped and moshed to dark, intense soca from the local stars of the season, especially the riotous “Bury All” by Lil Kerry. Some toted hyperrealistic props of bloody octopus tentacles in their mouths. There were a few Scream masks. As night grew to day, I saw the age range widen – elders danced joyfully in their black paint, a father doused his school-aged sons in oil as they splashed and played. I let random men pour their tubs of motor oil on me. I danced and marched for miles. I had never felt so free, so powerful, or so connected in a sea of strangers.  So, that night, after bathing in the crystal blue ocean with sand and dish soap alongside hundreds of others (and two more showers), I wept in the bed of my Sandals suite.

	Some tears were of pain. About 11 percent of Africans brought to Grenada as slaves between 1669 and 1808 are believed to have been Sierra Leonean, like my parents, whose direct lineage avoided the ships by grace alone. Many Grenadians are believed to be descendants of our own Temne tribe. I cried for those stolen from Sierra Leone and for the colonial shambles the country is still in. I cried for everything my family has continued to endure there. There were also tears of pride for all the resilience around me – my immigrant mother's resolution to thrive, my dead grandmothers' resolution to love, and the Grenadian resolution to carry Jab Jab traditions from African coasts to Caribbean plantations to the very city streets I walked so brazenly that day. I cried because with every video I WhatsApped my mom of Grenada's rolling hills, bright architecture, national dishes, skilled drummers, and limber dancers, she messaged back, “This might as well be Sierra Leone.” Grenada's Spicemas felt more African than I could have ever imagined. As the world shrinks for Africans, with growing travel to places like Lagos, Accra, Johannesburg, and Cape Town, carnival in Grenada strikes me as a necessary diasporic destination, too.

	“We want people to come to experience our culture and to do so respectfully,” says Fiona Compton, founder of Know Your Caribbean, an educational platform for West Indian culture and history with nearly half a million Instagram followers. Compton is the daughter of St. Lucia's first Prime Minister, Sir John Compton. She began obsessively studying Caribbean archives after seeing reductive representation of her people as a college student in London. “Take the initiative to come and to learn why it is we do what we do, so that way the culture will not become a parody of ourselves,” Compton warns potential visitors. “People realize you put on the horns to remind people of the evils of what we come from. We're not here to just perform and just be some pretty characters,” she says, nodding to the popular Fancy Mas traditions of Carnival Tuesday, which can be an expensive outing of bejeweled body suits, elaborate feathered wings, professional make-up, and endless rum and food. It's important as a deeply carnal celebration of freedom, and like J'ouvert, it too serves a real purpose. “We are here to go into something that's deeply spiritual.”


	You can hear the Grenadian reverence for their traditions in the very songs that soundtrack carnival, blasted from 16-wheeler sound systems. One of the tenants of Spicemas is Soca Monarch, a competition at the national stadium where local artists perform songs made specifically for the season in massive productions. “Culturally, my island full of history,” sings L.E.D. on the song he competed with, “Viral Again.” “So happy to my neighbor/My neighbor happy to see me/Nobody here is strangers/One big family/We serving one creator/And we play mas tremendously.” It rides the same riddim, or beat, as Muddy's “Payroll,” which earned him the Soca Monarch title. “Payroll” is absolutely electric, with a moving music video of he and a crew playing Jab Jab like an army. “When stars align/Greatness outshines all hatred in space and time,” Muddy chants in the song's stirring first moments. “And still we rise/With grace and with faith in the morning, with chains and oil.”

	











	While I spent Spicemas in the capital of Saint George's, where there are the most populous gatherings, Jab Jab musician, historian, and preservationist Ian Charles tells me there's a distinct authenticity to J'ouvert in the more rural parishes where massive plantations once dominated. “If you're looking for hardcore, pristine cultural drums on the road, no big music trucks, you got to go up to Saint Andrew and Saint Patrick,” he says. While the jab music of Soca Monarch is digitized and modern, like Afrobeats, in its traditional form, Grenadian jab soca consists of a three-hand-drum system – one for bass, one for melody, and one called a “kupai,” akin to the French word for “to cut.” Jab Jab players use the goat-skin dùndún drum of Nigerian, Yoruba lineage and the Malian djembe drum. The drum patterns, says Charles, are not far off from that of genres like Fuji and Juju. On top of these rhythms, there's call and response storytelling, and the blows of a conch shell. 


	All these elements, Charles and Compton explain, were inherited from Africa. “The drum was used for lots of things,” says Compton. “It's conjuring spirits, it's sending secret messages, and it was inciting the spirit of rebellion. In my research, looking at many of the rebellions of enslaved people across the Caribbean, the drum was always used in a ceremony just before. Now, people hear the drum and we cannot help but start moving. It lights up something inside of us.” Because of the revolts, Compton says, drumming and African spiritual practices were eventually criminalized in the colonies. As Black instruments were confiscated and burned, the new Caribbeans would abandon their plantations to perform secret rites in the forests, or remake their tools entirely. “That's how the invention of steel pan [drumming] happened,” Compton says as an aside. “Because all forms of African percussion were made illegal in Trinidad well into the 1930s, so Trinidadians decided to rebel against that. Trinidad has oil, so they had all of the surplus of oil drums. They were saying, ‘We're not going to adhere to these laws; we're going to create a whole new style of music.'”


	One of the moments that moved me most was seeing a massive Ghanaian flag waving majestically in the Soca Monarch crowd as I watched from a suite high above the stadium at first. Throughout carnival, there are flags everywhere – people swing them above their heads, tie them to their waists, and hoist them high from poles. There are all kinds of flags too – mostly Caribbean, but I later met a queer Hondouran with their flag, and spotted a few Nigerians too. Yet, Soca Monarch was my first night of Spicemas, and I immediately felt at home. My family played so much soca at our parties that as a child, I assumed it was African music. Seeing a West African flag so prominently and so seamlessly signaled to me I was somewhere I belonged. I happened to run into the Ghanaian crew with the towering Black Star at Fancy Mas, and bolted to them. We embraced like old friends. One of them is a neurosurgeon where I live. Another told me they always travel the world as a group, and Spicemas felt like somewhere they belonged, too.

	











	Dr. Shantel George, an Afro-Caribbean history scholar at the University of Glasgow, found that  at the heights of the slave trade in Grenada, between 1669 and 1808, 33 percent of captives came from ports at the Bight of Biafra, representing tribes we now think of as Nigerian, like the Igbo. Another 21 percent came from the Gold Coast, likely people from present-day Ghana and Burkina Faso. Fourteen percent came from what was known as the Windward Coast; today, Ivory Coast and Liberia. Eleven percent came from West-Central Africa, incorporating folks from the Kongo kingdom and modern Gabon. Another five percent were likely of the Mandingo, Bambara, Malinke, Wolof, and Fulbe tribes of the Senegambia port, and the last portion were thought to be of the Bight of Benin, kidnapped from places in modern Benin and Lagos, Nigeria.

	Once in Grenada as a hodgepodge of stolen people, they reformed themselves into new ethnic groups and developed a tradition called Nation Dance, weekly spectacles where these emerging families represented themselves. “Nation Dance exemplifies the ways in which peoples were able to resist racial slavery through the formation of new diasporic identities and relationships which drew on their African experiences,” George cites. They elected kings and queens in masquerades like the ones of Spicemas now. I say all this to say that while Spicemas is distinctly Grenadian, it is also very African, and proudly so. It's worth seeing for yourself.

US Air Force F-22s were dispatched in coordination with Canadian fighters. One F-22 successfully downed the object, marking the first time NORAD authorised an aerial shoot-down in its history.

The F-22 Raptor was crafted to dominate air combat through stealth and advanced systems. While it has never engaged in full-scale combat, it has played an intriguing role in intercepting and investigating unidentified aerial objects. Let's explores how the jet's unique capabilities have made it a key asset in confronting mysteries above, a tale of precision patrols, radar enigmas, and national security responses.

In early 2023, a Chinese surveillance balloon drifted over the United States, reaching heights of 60,000 feet. It was ultimately shot down by an F-22 using a missile strike, believed to be the highest altitude air intercept in history. Though not an extraterrestrial encounter, the incident showed how the Raptor can quickly respond to airborne anomalies, real or suspected. 

Just days after the balloon incident, NORAD detected another unidentified high-altitude object over Yukon, Canada. US Air Force F-22s were dispatched in coordination with Canadian fighters. One F-22 successfully downed the object, marking the first time NORAD authorised an aerial shoot-down in its history.

These events came amid heightened airspace scrutiny spawned by prior balloon sightings. Enhanced radar resolution and rapid response protocols meant that even slow, small objects, previously dismissed, were now tracked closely, prompting F-22 intercepts as precautionary measures. 

Historical precedents show the military's long-standing role in intercepting unidentified craft. From the famed 2004 Nimitz encounter to sightings over cities and remote regions, jets, including the F-22, serve as both eyes and shields. These deployments underscore a broader truth, that even modern stealth fighters are central to investigating the unknown. 

The F-22's stealth, speed, and advanced sensors enable it to intercept anomalies with minimal notice. Whether the object is hostile, experimental, or just odd, the Raptor delivers the response, silent, swift, and informed. In doing so, it stands as a symbol of modern airspace defence in an age of emerging aerial threats.

The F-22 Raptor never set out to chase UFOs, yet it now shadows them. Its role in neutralising unknown aerial objects, from suspected spy balloons to unidentified intrusions, underscores its flexibility and the growing importance of airspace sovereignty.

Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon.

Image: Independent Media archives

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as ""not natural"".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy -  Oumuamua and Borisov - and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by ""Independent Media"".

Elizabeth Klarer's sketch of Akon, with whom she claimed to have had a child with, named Ayling.

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book ""Beyond the Light Barrier"", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the ""Sunday Tribune"" over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the ""lightning bird"" appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

First Lady Melania Trump's signature on the letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin is at the center of wild social media speculation

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

First Lady Melania Trump wasn't at last week's summit in Alaska with her husband President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin - but she was there in spirit. 

Trump handed Putin a letter from his wife, appealing to him to remember the innocence of the children caught in the midst of the fighting between Russia and Ukraine, and to put an end to the violence.

“In today's world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them — a silent defiance against the forces that can potentially claim their future,” the first lady wrote. “Mr. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter.”

At the end of the letter, which was shared on social media by Attorney General Pam Bondi, was the first lady's signature, which looked rather familiar.

And it sparked wild speculation online. 

It didn't take long for people to remark how similar it looked to the president's. 

“Donald Trump and Melania Trump's signatures. So weird,” said one person on X, who shared a side-by-side image of the two. “That's IDENTICAL to Trump's own signature…”

“Melania has the same type of signature as Trump...odd...” wrote a Facebook user.

“Why she have the same sharpie a** signature as Trump?” said another, referring to the president's favorite pen.

“No way is that her signature,” said another. “She didn't write it and Trump signed it,” someone else said on Facebook, without evidence.

Others questioned why the first lady's signature appears to have changed over the years, with one user asking Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot, “Why did Melania Trump change her signature?”

“Melania Trump's signature evolved after her 2005 marriage, shifting from a flowing cursive style (as Melania Knauss) to a peaked, stylized one resembling Donald's,” Grok replied. “Analysts suggest it's for branding unity, quick signing via autopen or to reflect tenacity and privacy. No official reason given.”

The chatbot's answer actually tallies with the opinion of Bart Baggett, a handwriting expert who has testified in criminal cases. He said the style with its “angular letters” and “long downstrokes” is all about the Trump “brand.”

“She's got angular writing that's a fast, analytical line. She's had that long before she met Donald Trump,” Baggett said. 

However, Melania's handwriting and signature has “morphed” into Trump's in the last 10 years, the expert noted.

“Her current handwriting is almost like a brand, like a logo, and I think she morphed it a little bit more into matching Trump's as she bought into the brand,” Baggett added.

The signature on the letter to Putin is an “aggressive” one, which tied in with the powerful display of a B-2 Stealth Bomber flying overhead as the two leaders met for the first time last week, the expert said. 

“[Trump] did have a bomber fly over their meeting, he did have a red carpet. He had a lot of pomp and circumstance,” Baggett said. “So there's a lot of pressure about how powerful we are as a country and so that doesn't surprise me that it's a more aggressive signature.”

“You don't want a heart and flowers on your letters,” Baggett added, referring back to a handwritten note Melania penned in 2017 to the patients of a children's hospital in Italy.

Baggett, who stressed that he has not examined the letter to Putin personally, poured cold water on the conspiracy theory that the first lady's signature was forged in any way. 

“I don't see any nefarious thing about her letter,” Baggett said. “Those conspiracy theories, I think, are just grasping at straws.”

Chatter online turned to Trump's Sharpie, the marker he raved about during his first term, and he has used to sign dozens of executive orders since his return to the White House. 

“Did she borrow his Sharpie?” one person joked on X.

Well, quite possibly, according to Baggett, who said the Sharpie is typical of the Trump brand.

“I think a Sharpie probably was used, and it is very typical of his brand,” he said, referring to the signature on the Putin letter. “For some people, if you write really heavy, Sharpies are [a] really good instrument. People that write heavy are more passionate.”

The marker has become a trademark of the president's.

“I was signing documents with a very expensive pen and it didn't write well,” Trump said in a 2018 HBO documentary in partnership with Axios. “It was a horrible pen, and it was extremely expensive.”

“And then I started using just a Sharpie, and I said to myself, ‘Well wait a minute, this writes much better and this cost almost nothing,'” Trump said.

Reddit and X users were also wildly speculating whether the first lady used an autopen—which has become one of the president's go-to attack lines on his predecessor Joe Biden. Earlier this year, Trump began accusing Biden of using the mechanical device to sign pardoning documents, rather than doing so by hand. Trump claimed, without providing evidence, that Biden had no knowledge or approval of the documents.

“Did Melania use Donald's autopen?” asked one X user.

“The autopen can only have one signature preset,” jested another.

The Independent has contacted the White House to inquire whether the first lady did, indeed, use Trump's Sharpie or an autopen to sign the letter to the Russian dictator.

Unfortunately for the autopen conspiracy theorists out there, until there is a definitive answer - it will remain a mystery. 

“If [Melania] has an autopen, we don't know about it,” Baggett concluded. “But [the signature] doesn't really deviate too much from her known handwriting,” the expert said. “She's got angular letters, she's got a very similar Trumpian style of ‘aggressiveness,' which I'll call triangles.'”

Some players have refused to sign a contract despite having the pen in their hand, while others have gone into hiding to avoid a transfer

As we all know, football is no longer a sport. It's a business - and a pretty ruthless one at that. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the transfer market, where money is king and the idea of a 'gentleman's agreement' is utterly laughable. This is why it's so naive for supporters to think that a 'Here we go!' is akin to confirmation that a deal has been done.

In reality, clubs cannot take anything for granted until a player signs on the dotted line, given there are all sorts of things that can go wrong at the 11th hour. Remember, even a faulty fax machine can scupper a proposed move!

However, the biggest threat to the completion of a transfer is last-minute interest from elsewhere - as Tottenham have once again discovered to their considerable cost.

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

The stage is set for an entertaining first day at the US Open with 20 matches on the slate. As always, we here at LWOT will be offering our predictions for every match on the slate, including Jessica Pegula vs Mayar Sherif, Emma Raducanu vs Ena Shibahara, Jasmine Paolini vs Destanee Aiava, and Aryna Sabalenka vs Rebeka Masarova. But who will book their spot in the round of 64?

US Open Day 1 Predictions

Victoria Azarenka vs Hina Inoue

Ilemona: Victoria Azarenka's history in New York speaks for itself, and she's been solid in her hard-court tune-ups. Hina Inoue is still in the early stages of her career and hasn't faced many opponents of this caliber. The gap in experience here could prove hard to bridge.

Prediction: Azarenka in 2

Zain: Three-time US Open finalist Victoria Azarenka brings far too much experience and intensity for Miyu Inoue to handle. Expect the veteran to lean on her big serve to come out on top in a match closer than expected.

Prediction: Azarenka in 3

Jordan: This will be Azarenka's first appearance since Wimbledon. The 36-year-old could have been particularly vulnerable to an upset, but facing a player making her Grand Slam main draw debut should help. The three-time US Open runner-up's experience and class is backed to prevail.

Prediction: Azarenka in 2

Veronika Kudermetova vs Janice Tjen

Ilemona: Veronika Kudermetova's season has been inconsistent, but she remains a dangerous ball striker on hard courts. Tjen doesn't yet have much tour-level experience, and adapting to the pace of this matchup will be a big ask. If Kudermetova keeps her focus, she should find her way through.

Prediction: Kudermetova in 2

Zain: Veronika Kudermetova's firepower and tour-level experience should overwhelm Faye Tjen. Unless her consistency wavers badly, expect a straightforward win.

Prediction: Kudermetova in 2

Jordan: Tjen's three straight-set victories in qualifying were surprising. Recent Cincinnati Open semifinalist Kudermetova remains the favorite, but this could be closer than many expect. Tjen's level in qualifying was very high.

Caty McNally vs Jil Teichman

Ilemona: Caty McNally has been making steady progress, especially with her attacking style suited to hard courts. Teichmann has struggled for results most of this season and hasn't looked comfortable on faster surfaces. That contrast gives McNally a good chance to dictate.

Prediction: McNally in 3

Zain: Caty McNally's aggressive net play and home-crowd support give her the edge. Jil Teichmann's variety can be tricky, but McNally should dictate with her backhand and advance.

Prediction: McNally in 3

Jordan: McNally will try to effectively implement her aggressive style. But Teichmann is an underrated player, with an ability to nullify attacking opponents. The Swiss can stop McNally and silence the home crowd if she defends near her best.

Anastasia Potapova vs Zhu Lin

Ilemona: Anastasia Potapova's game can be streaky, but her ability to hit through opponents makes her dangerous on this surface. Lin Zhu is a tricky competitor with solid results on hard courts, often able to extend rallies and frustrate opponents. This one has the makings of a close battle if both bring their best level.

Prediction: Potapova in 3

Zain: Anastasia Potapova's offensive baseline game should be too strong for Lin Zhu, especially if she takes control early. Zhu's steadiness might extend rallies, but Potapova has the heavier weapons to win.

Prediction: Potapova in 2

Jordan: Zhu plays her best tennis on hard courts, but she is still finding her feet after returning in June from several months out with an injury. However, Potapova has played poorly so far during the North American swing, and Zhu thrives most against players who award her time on hard courts. The favourable matchup might get the Chinese opponent over the line.

Prediction: Zhu in 3
