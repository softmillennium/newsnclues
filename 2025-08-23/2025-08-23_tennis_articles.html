                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The top seed and defending US Open champion remains unbeaten at the hard-court majors since 2023, but he will face fierce competition from the likes of rival Carlos Alcaraz, four-time winner Novak Djokovic and former finalist Alexander Zverev. Other contenders for the US Open include last year's runner-up Taylor Fritz, British No. 1 Jack Draper, in-form American Ben Shelton and plenty more. 1) Sinner's pursuit of triple-major season: Despite retiring ill against Alcaraz in their Cincinnati final last week, Sinner will begin his title defence full of confidence, having claimed the past three hard-court major titles. Sinner owns a 31-4 tour-level record this season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He first plays Vit Kopriva and is seeded to meet Draper in the quarter-finals. 1 takeover: With a Tour-leading 54 wins and six titles in 2025, Alcaraz will aim to continue his impressive season at the US Open, which could have huge implications on the PIF ATP Rankings. Alcaraz was stunned in the second round by Botic van de Zandschulp last year and will start 50 points ahead of defending champion Sinner in the Live Rankings this year. 3) Djokovic's charge for record 25th major: Djokovic returns to tour-level action for the first time since reaching the Wimbledon semi-finals five weeks ago and is chasing a record 25th major title, and first since he won in New York in 2023. The Serbian has reached the last four at all three Grand Slam tournaments this year, retiring against Zverev in Melbourne before losing to Sinner in straight sets at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. 4) Can Zverev go one step further at a Slam? A three-time major finalist, Zverev suffered heartbreaking five-set losses to Dominic Thiem at the 2020 US Open and to Alcaraz at Roland Garros last year before falling to Sinner in three in the Australian Open final in January. 5) Shelton, Ruud, Medvedev lurking in Alcaraz's quarter: If Alcaraz is to strengthen his chances of winning a second US Open title, he will first have to navigate a testing quarter, which features 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev, 2022 runner-up Casper Ruud and this month's Toronto titlist Ben Shelton. Ruud is currently 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and will aim to bolster his chances of qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals with a deep run in New York. You May Also Like: Alcaraz, Djokovic in same half of US Open draw; Sinner plays Kopriva A standout performer of the North American hard-court swing so far, Shelton returns to his home major riding a strong run of form. The 22-year-old boasts an 11-3 tour-level record in the past month, highlighted by winning his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Toronto and thus rising to a career-high World No. He is projected to meet Alcaraz in the quarter-finals. 1 Draper was a surprise semi-finalist at Flushing Meadows in 2024 but is now an established player at the top of the game. In March, he won his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Indian Wells, where he stunned Alcaraz in the semi-finals, but he is yet to compete since his shock second-round defeat to Marin Cilic at Wimbledon. Washington champion Alex de Minaur, Toronto finalist Karen Khachanov and World No. 10 Lorenzo Musetti are all players to look out for in New York. 7) Teen talents: Miami champion Jakub Mensik leads a charge of teenage talents aiming to make their mark at the US Open. The 19-year-old Czech, who reached the third round in his two prior appearances, is joined by 19-year-old Brazilian Joao Fonseca and 19-year-old American Learner Tien. The 2023 US Open boys' singles champion, Fonseca won his first ATP Tour title in Buenos Aires in February and will make his main-draw debut in New York this week. 1 battle heats up: After winning his eighth ATP Masters 1000 trophy in Cincinnati, Alcaraz has taken a 1,890-point lead over Sinner in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin. The Italian will aim to reduce that deficit in New York as he aims to retain his Year-End ATP No. 9) First-round matches to watch: Alexander Bublik, who has captured three tour-level titles during the European summer swing, faces a stern test against former champion Marin Cilic in his first appearance of the North American hard-court swing. Musetti also faces a challenge against big-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in his opener, while Wimbledon quarter-finalist Cameron Norrie starts against American Sebastian Korda. 10) Cash/Glasspool eye second major in 2025: Despite seeing their 22-match tour-level winning streak come to an end in the Cincinnati semi-finals, Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool arrive at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Serbian has endured a relatively tumultuous year in this area, with Djokovic splitting with Andy Murray just months after their shock partnership was announced. However, that has not stopped him from performing at a supremely consistent level at the Grand Slams, reaching the semi-finals of all three he has featured in. For most on tour, this would mark a sensational return. And, in a revelation that might shock most, the man who helped lead him through both the French Open and Wimbledon will not be present with him in New York. Novak Djokovic revealed: “Dule is not with me now, maybe he will be at some tournaments in the future. I say again, we don't have a contract or a long-term agreement – it's more sporadic; if it suits both of us, we work. The 38-year-old spent many years with Dušan Vemic at his side before they went their separate ways, yet have continued to reunite on occasion. Upon his return after the Murray departure, it was always going to be just a short-term reunion. After all, he insisted that he hopes that Monica Seles, a nine-time Grand Slam champion who retired in 2008, will one day join his staff. “These are initial discussions, it's more about emotions than a long-term collaboration. After his brief union with Murray, this would be yet another shocking partnership that would surely take the tennis world by storm.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But who will book their spot in the round of 64? The gap in experience here could prove hard to bridge. Zain: Three-time US Open finalist Victoria Azarenka brings far too much experience and intensity for Miyu Inoue to handle. Jordan: This will be Azarenka's first appearance since Wimbledon. The 36-year-old could have been particularly vulnerable to an upset, but facing a player making her Grand Slam main draw debut should help. The three-time US Open runner-up's experience and class is backed to prevail. Ilemona: Veronika Kudermetova's season has been inconsistent, but she remains a dangerous ball striker on hard courts. Tjen doesn't yet have much tour-level experience, and adapting to the pace of this matchup will be a big ask. Zain: Veronika Kudermetova's firepower and tour-level experience should overwhelm Faye Tjen. Unless her consistency wavers badly, expect a straightforward win. Jordan: Tjen's three straight-set victories in qualifying were surprising. Recent Cincinnati Open semifinalist Kudermetova remains the favorite, but this could be closer than many expect. Ilemona: Caty McNally has been making steady progress, especially with her attacking style suited to hard courts. That contrast gives McNally a good chance to dictate. Zain: Caty McNally's aggressive net play and home-crowd support give her the edge. Jil Teichmann's variety can be tricky, but McNally should dictate with her backhand and advance. Jordan: McNally will try to effectively implement her aggressive style. Lin Zhu is a tricky competitor with solid results on hard courts, often able to extend rallies and frustrate opponents. This one has the makings of a close battle if both bring their best level. Zain: Anastasia Potapova's offensive baseline game should be too strong for Lin Zhu, especially if she takes control early. Zhu's steadiness might extend rallies, but Potapova has the heavier weapons to win. Jordan: Zhu plays her best tennis on hard courts, but she is still finding her feet after returning in June from several months out with an injury. However, Potapova has played poorly so far during the North American swing, and Zhu thrives most against players who award her time on hard courts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. It's a given that much of the coverage and attention devoted to Venus Williams' return to the U.S. Open, where play begins Sunday, has focused — and will focus — on how old she is. And yet there is plenty more that is significant about her first appearance at a Grand Slam tournament in two full years, regardless of how Williams plays in Arthur Ashe Stadium on Monday night when meets Karolina Muchova, the 2023 French Open runner-up and a two-time semifinalist in New York. Venus Williams is at a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in 2 years “It's just really, I would say, inspiring,” said Naomi Osaka, 27, a four-time Grand Slam champion. “My only thing is: I don't really like how every headline mentions her age. Williams and her younger sister Serena whose last match as a pro came at Flushing Meadows in 2022, represent an indelible chapter in the history of tennis, yes, but also of sports in a greater sense and even American society. “Her and her sister, they're not only great for the women's game, not only great for women's sports, but they are so iconic.” Venus and Serena Williams are sisters who both reached the top of tennis Their story bears repeating: Two siblings were first taught tennis by their self-taught father and both not only made it to the professional tour but both reached No. “People, I guess,” Osaka said, “should value them a little bit more.” Osaka grew up watching the Williams sisters, then competed against them. So did plenty of other women, such as Coco Gauff, who first announced herself to the world by defeating Venus at Wimbledon in 2019. After that match, Gauff — just 15 at the time — said she thanked Venus “for everything she did,” and told reporters: “I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her.” Venus was the first Black woman since Althea Gibson to win Wimbledon “It's not, kind of, to prove people wrong, but it's because she truly loves the sport — and you can see the kid in her. Venus Williams owns 23 Grand Slam trophies in singles and doubles That's aside from 14 Grand Slam titles in women's doubles — all with Serena — and two in mixed doubles, an event she returned to at Flushing Meadows this week. Since the Williams sisters came on the scene — Venus made her professional debut in 1994, when she was 14; Serena, who is 15 months younger, would soon follow and ended up with 23 major singles titles — they set an example for kids who looked like them and wanted to play tennis. Last month in Washington, Williams took pride in noticing that there were three Black women competing on the court when she played — and won, by the way — a doubles match during the first event of her comeback. “It's amazing that now African-American girls know they can play tennis, that that's an option, an opportunity for them to be out there, too, on the court, in whatever capacity,” she said, “whether you get to the pros, whether you play college or whether you just learn from the sport.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz appear headed for their third straight meeting in a major tournament final. A run to the final is the minimum expectation for Aryna Sabalenka, who enters New York with five consecutive appearances in hard-court major finals. A slew of top American talent will try to upset the favorites in their home major, but a strong case can be made for each final to pit No. The winners of the men's and women's singles events will each take home $5 million in prize money. The men's singles draw seems too easy to predict. He also has a much easier draw than Alcaraz to reach the final. Alcaraz might have to get through at least two of Novak Djokovic, Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton to reach the championship match. Alcaraz reached at least the quarterfinal round in three of his four US Open appearances. He might play with a little extra motivation in New York after he experienced a rare second-round exit in 2024. Fritz, Shelton and a few others could reach the final with an incredible two weeks, but on paper, Sinner and Alcaraz have to be viewed as the favorites. On the women's side, Sabalenka is a near lock to reach the final given her track record on hard courts. Sabalenka is the reigning US Open champion and she's won three of the last five hard-court majors. If Sabalenka isn't in the final, it will be a massive surprise. Swiatek's had more variance in her career on hard courts. She's made it past the quarterfinals once in New York and she has two semifinal appearances in seven Australian Opens. Australian Open winner Madison Keys and Coco Gauff reside in Swiatek's side of the draw. Both Americans are more than capable of beating Swiatek on the hard-court surface. Keys is a three-time US Open semifinalist and she excels on the hard court, while Gauff has had more early exits than long runs in New York so far in her career. A Keys-Sabalenka rematch from Melbourne could very well be in the cards if Keys finds the same form she did down under earlier this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis icon Roger Federer has become the seventh billionaire athlete in history, according to estimates published by Forbes on Friday. The Swiss star, who retired from the sport in 2022, is now believed to have a net worth of $1.1 billion, boosted by his minority stake in Swiss shoe and apparel brand On. Having collected around $1 billion in off-court endeavors during his playing career, Federer was tennis' highest-paid player for 16 straight years despite earning less in prize money than rivals Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. Federer becomes tennis' second billionaire, following Romanian player Ion Țiriac, who won the 1970 French Open men's doubles championship and began investing after the fall of communism. Also on the list are basketball stars Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and LeBron James, as well as Milwaukee Bucks sixth man Junior Bridgeman. Tiger Woods rounds out the list and joins James as the only players to have become billionaires while still competing in their sports. Only Federer, Djokovic and Naomi Osaka have ever earned more in a single year. Coco Gauff placed third on this year's list, having earned $37.2 million – more than any other female athlete over the last 12 months. Her placement means that – for the first time since Federer, Maria Sharapova and Nadal in 2010 – each of the top three are under 30. In total, the top 10 highest earners made a combined $285 million, up 16% from last year but still significantly less than the record of $343 million in 2020.

Since the start of 2024, Novak Djokovic has been playing more sporadically. This year he played the entire clay court season and Wimbledon, but Djokovic withdrew from Canada and Cincinnati. Ahead of his 19th US Open appearance, the former world number one explained the reason for his absence. “Obviously I didn't have any matches since Wimbledon. There has been plenty of discussion among players and pundits regarding the extended Masters and WTA 1000 tournaments. Rather than lasting a week, many of them now take at least 10 to 12 days, with some tournaments even hosting the finals during the week compared to the weekend. Players such as Carlos Alcaraz do not agree with the move, and Djokovic has explained why he dislikes the longer Masters 1000 tournaments. “To be quite frank with you, I don't enjoy the two-week Masters events anymore. It's just way too long for me. I'd like to play more of the other tournaments, but I just, we have currently informally, unofficially, 12 Grand Slams a year, you know, when you think about it. “I mean, Grand Slam is two weeks and the other Masters events are almost two weeks, as well. So yeah, it's just not any more prioritizing the heavy schedule as I used to. I just don't think about it anymore.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Aryna Sabalenka go “Slamless” in 2025 — and does it even matter? Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner could go eight from eight at the Grand Slams — but their bigger fight might take place in the world rankings. But she has one more chance for that elusive major, and Iga Świątek is hot on her heels at the top of the rankings. Her Grand Slam record this year speaks to going deep reliably as much as missing out at the last. But she has also eked out a lot of wins through tiebreaks — tiebreaks which became tiebreaks because she had to recover from her serve being broken, not because both players held. Only two of the 19 sets Sabalenka has played in 2025 that ended in tiebreaks have not featured a break. “If this goal is not going to be achieved, I'll still think that this season has been really amazing for me,” she said in her pre-tournament news conference. “All of those tough lessons that I learned this season are only going to make me stronger for the next one. I'll work even harder in the preseason to make sure next year is going to be only a year of success, like truly success.” 1 is a tennis archetype that refuses to budge even though it ultimately means little. Sabalenka appears to be aware of that — but she will also be desperate to make sure that she does not fill it. Having never had a match between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, let alone a final, the U.S. Open won't be taking anything for granted when it comes to a potential meeting between Alcaraz and Sinner in two weeks' time. If the world's two best men's players do contest their third Grand Slam final in a row, it would be the first time it has ever happened on the ATP Tour in the same calendar year; Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic faced each other in four straight finals across 2011 and 2012. Sinner and Alcaraz met in a final as recently as this week, but their Cincinnati Open contest was cut short in the first set with the Italian feeling unwell. What's especially worrying for the rest of the field is that each time these two play each other, they each elevate the other a bit more and create ever-increasing distance from their peers. If Alcaraz betters Sinner's result in New York, he will assume the world No. 1 ranking, having lost it to Sinner last year despite beating his nearest rival in all three of their meetings that year. And they appear aware of the task at hand. “If we don't continue to improve, players will catch us,” Sinner said in a news conference Friday. After winning all of the previous seven majors between them, it still doesn't look like happening anytime soon. Focussing on process rather than results is one if the biggest cliches in sports and life. As cliches go, it's not a bad one to follow. Gauff became a walking billboard for it this week, when she switched technical coaches and embarked on the process of changing her serve just days before the start of her home Slam, which is arguably her most important tournament of the year. Her new coach, Gavin MacMillan, achieved pretty fast results with Sabalenka three years ago when he worked with her. “I'm looking at long-term,” Gauff said Friday. “I hope I can get it all together.” She knew she needed to make a change, even if that meant potentially sacrificing this tournament while she tries to learn on the fly. With every passing Grand Slam, the sandwich generation of 1990s-born players led by Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas seems to slip further and further away from genuine contention. 3, is slightly separate from this, but for Tsitsipas and Medvedev, it's been a miserable year. Especially at the Grand Slams, where they have two match wins between them in 2025. Tsitsipas is battling an ongoing back injury and has given worrying quotes about how much it's affecting him, while Medvedev has looked hopelessly underpowered for much of the year. Zverev said Friday that consideration has to be given to external factors when assessing a player's form, and that he expects both Medvedev and Tsitsipas to work their way back into the world's top 10. At present, though, the most likely genuine challengers to Sinner and Alcaraz would appear to be the players younger than them rather than the lost boys of men's tennis. It was the first topic raised with Emma Raducanu in her news conference Friday, and she instantly suggested the other majors should follow suit. “Yeah, I think it would be so fun if all the slams got involved and did something similar, even if it was not the exact same format. “I think it was a huge success.” That said, every other slam from here on in, including the U.S. Open, can refine and rework the mixed-doubles event from the last week to make it an even more compelling package. Gauff, for instance, said in a news conference Friday that she very much enjoyed the event, but that it would benefit from more actual doubles teams. This tournament is notorious for its late finishes. When matches finish in the small hours of the morning and players get to sleep as the sun is rising, it's talked about as an epic event, regardless of how bad it is for the people competing for one of the biggest prizes in their sport or any other. This generally happens during the night sessions on the stadium courts, when two matches take place but don't start before 7 p.m. When a men's match goes more than four hours or a women's match goes more than three, the tournament has a Late Finishing Match policy, which it introduced last year. If a match isn't likely to start before 11:15 p.m., tournament officials have claimed the right to move it into or out of Louis Armstrong or Arthur Ashe Stadiums. As the first weekend of last year's U.S. Open ticked from Sunday night into Monday morning, Zheng Qinwen and Donna Vekic set a record for the latest-finishing women's match in U.S. Open history, with Zheng closing out match point at 2:15 a.m. That was just a few minutes later than the finish time for Sabalenka and Ekaterina Alexandrova's third-round match earlier in the first week. That had been down on the Friday, but started very early Saturday morning, at 12:08 a.m. It was the latest-starting match in U.S. Open history. They will talk to the players about it and take their opinions into consideration, but don't have to follow them. Probably some more late nights at the U.S. Open.

Marton Fucsovics benefited from the forfeit of Sebastian Korda on Friday evening

Hungarian Marton Fucsovics moved into the final of the Winston-Salem Open after American Sebastian Korda, the No 11 seed, withdrew before the match at the Wake Forest Tennis Complex on Friday evening.

“Hello everyone. I woke up this morning feeling a bit unwell and I thought it was going to be difficult to play today. It's been three long months of recovery and I want to stay on the right track. Thank you for all the support and love,” said the American player on X.

Marton Fucsovics will play the fifth final of his career on the ATP Tour this Saturday, his first in Winston-Salem. So far, he has won two titles, in Geneva and Bucharest, both on clay.

Earlier in the tournament, Fucsovics, ranked No 91, won against Spaniard Jaume Munar, the No 12 seed (7-5, 6-3), Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut, the No 14 seed (6-4, 6-3), Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor, the second seed (6-3, 4-6, 6-3) and Frenchman Hugo Gaston (6-3, 6-3).

Korda, ranked No 45, beat Serb Miomir Kecmanovic, the No 13 seed (6-1, 6-4), Pole Kamil Majchrzak (6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-4) and Czech Vit Kopriva (6-3, 6-4) in the previous rounds of the Winston-Salem tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu has challenged Wimbledon to replicate the new and revamped US Open approach to the mixed doubles tournament - which took place before the singles draw begins on Monday. Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud as well as Daniil Medvedev and Mirra Andreeva also competed. The bigger names were able to attract far greater attention and, as a result, prize money. Fans who would otherwise turn a blind eye to the mixed doubles chose to watch and Raducanu thinks the remaining three Grand Slams should look to follow suit. The 22-year-old said: “I think it would be so fun if all the Slams got involved and did something similar, even if it was not the exact same format. I think it was a huge success. I think it was a great idea. And, yeah, I had a lot of fun on the court playing with Carlos.” Raducanu's partnership with Alcaraz only lasted two sets and 50 minutes, but attracted huge attention. Instead matches were best-of-three contests with each set played to four games. Murray, himself a mixed doubles champion at the All England Club, was not a fan of the format and also claimed that the influx of more headline names prevented the usual doubles players from competing and earning prize money. "It was more of an exhibition in my eyes, I think maybe a lot of people's eyes," he told the Sports Agents podcast. "The prize money gap in Grand Slams between singles and doubles is more than 90:10, so it's already sort of massive… If you're watching the golf, for example, and a guy's got a putt from four feet for $1 million, and then you turn the channel and the guy's got a putt from four feet for $20,000 – what are you going to watch?"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The reimagined US Open mixed doubles tournament came to an end on Wednesday night, with defending champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori lifting the trophy again. Entries were based on singles rankings, a fast-four scoring format was used until the final, and a staggering £743k ($1million) prize was on offer for the champions, compared to £149k ($200k) last year. Players are now questioning whether other Grand Slam tournaments, including Wimbledon, could follow suit. Casper Ruud, who finished runner-up alongside Iga Swiatek, said: “I guess they have their eyes open. It was a bold move from the US Open to do this. Should Wimbledon ever move away from the traditional mixed doubles format, there would be a lot to consider. Adding even just two days to the programme for mixed doubles in the week before Wimbledon gets underway could be detrimental. But they proved that experience conquers entertainment, successfully defending their title and declaring: “This one is for all the doubles players that couldn't play this tournament.” Should other Slams revamp their mixed doubles offerings, they could consider extending the field or allowing more doubles players to compete. “Maybe you can put also the narrative about singles against doubles,” Vavassori suggested. The scoring format is another element that may need some work. Much was made of British No.1 Emma Raducanu's blockbuster partnership with five-time Major winner Carlos Alcaraz. But they spent just 51 minutes on court before going out to Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula 4-2 4-2. If regular set scoring had been used, Raducanu and Alcaraz would have had time to fight back from a break down and given the fans more tennis to watch. Katerina Siniakova and Sem Verbeek shared £135k for winning Wimbledon this year - and the purse would need to increase almost tenfold to match the prize in Flushing Meadows And, put simply, one of Wimbledon's biggest concerns would be going against tradition. But a new format wouldn't be entirely out of the question. When automatic line calling was brought in this year, CEO Sally Bolton reminded fans: “Wimbledon has always balanced heritage and tradition with innovation.” For now, Vavassori and Errani will enjoy their huge prize - and the satisfaction of proving that doubles is still an important specialism in its own right.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Van de Zandschulp broke Mpetshi Perricard three times, scattering six aces over the match lasting one hour and 36 minutes. Earlier Friday, he'd put the finishing touches on a 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 quarter-final win over China's Bu Yunchaokete, which had been halted Thursday night by rain. "It was a pretty quick two hours (between matches), but I think I managed well tonight," said van de Zandschulp, who will be seeking a first ATP title on Saturday in his third appearance in a final. The Hungarian advanced by walkover when American Sebastian Korda withdrew because of illness. Fucsovics is chasing a third ATP title. Korda was playing his first tournament since Roland Garros because of a stress fracture in his right shin, but the 25-year-old said it wasn't the injury that prompted him to pull out. "Woke up a bit under the weather and thought it was going to be difficult to play today," he said in a social media post. "Been a long three months recovering and want to stay on track." Van de Zandschulp, who stunned Spanish star Carlos Alcaraz in the second round at Flushing Meadows last year, is due to launch his campaign at the final Grand Slam of the year against 11th-seeded Holger Rune.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu has urged Wimbledon to launch an all-star mixed doubles tournament following the "huge success" of the groundbreaking event at this week's US Open. 1 suffered defeat in her sole match alongside fellow US Open champion Carlos Alcaraz against Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula. And not without that point being made. However, the innovative 16-team tournament proved enormously popular with spectators in the venue and across social media platforms, ensuring its return to Flushing Meadows in coming years. "I think it would be so fun if all the Slams got involved and did something similar, even if it was not the exact same format," Raducanu commented. "I think it was a huge success. And, yeah, I had a lot of fun on the court playing with Carlos." Ahead of the season's final Grand Slam, Raducanu has named Spaniard Francis Roig as her new coach, replacing interim coach Mark Petchey. The 2021 US Open winner believes her final Wimbledon encounter against Aryna Sabalenka convinced Rafa Nadal's former mentor to accept the position. "After Wimbledon, we always knew it was going to be difficult to keep things going forward with his commitments and everything," she said. "It was quite a good match with Aryna. I think quite a lot of people watched it. "After that, I just asked (agent) Jill (Smoller), who is looking after me, and I was like: 'Oh, do we have any more ideas?' "We arranged a few days before I came out to America. Yeah, it went well, but he couldn't start until Cincy. Since then we have been practicing and working well." Fran Jones has mirrored Raducanu's achievement of advancing through US Open qualifying without losing a single set after copying Carlos Alcaraz's pre-tournament trip to Ibiza. 4 received instant congratulations from close pal Raducanu upon securing her maiden main draw berth in New York. Raducanu also swept through three qualifying rounds without dropping a set in 2021 - before claiming another seven victories in the main event - to become the first qualifier ever to capture a Grand Slam crown. "What she did I don't think will ever be repeated but I'll be happy to fall into some of those footsteps for sure," Jones laughed. "She said good luck before the match and texted her congratulations just now. The Express uses notifications to keep you updated</p>
