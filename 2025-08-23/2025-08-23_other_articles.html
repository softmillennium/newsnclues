                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First Lady Melania Trump's signature on the letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin is at the center of wild social media speculation At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. First Lady Melania Trump wasn't at last week's summit in Alaska with her husband President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin - but she was there in spirit. “In today's world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them — a silent defiance against the forces that can potentially claim their future,” the first lady wrote. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter.” So weird,” said one person on X, who shared a side-by-side image of the two. “Melania has the same type of signature as Trump...odd...” wrote a Facebook user. “No way is that her signature,” said another. Others questioned why the first lady's signature appears to have changed over the years, with one user asking Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot, “Why did Melania Trump change her signature?” “Melania Trump's signature evolved after her 2005 marriage, shifting from a flowing cursive style (as Melania Knauss) to a peaked, stylized one resembling Donald's,” Grok replied. “Analysts suggest it's for branding unity, quick signing via autopen or to reflect tenacity and privacy. The chatbot's answer actually tallies with the opinion of Bart Baggett, a handwriting expert who has testified in criminal cases. “She's got angular writing that's a fast, analytical line. “Her current handwriting is almost like a brand, like a logo, and I think she morphed it a little bit more into matching Trump's as she bought into the brand,” Baggett added. He had a lot of pomp and circumstance,” Baggett said. “You don't want a heart and flowers on your letters,” Baggett added, referring back to a handwritten note Melania penned in 2017 to the patients of a children's hospital in Italy. “I don't see any nefarious thing about her letter,” Baggett said. “Those conspiracy theories, I think, are just grasping at straws.” Chatter online turned to Trump's Sharpie, the marker he raved about during his first term, and he has used to sign dozens of executive orders since his return to the White House. “Did she borrow his Sharpie?” one person joked on X. “I think a Sharpie probably was used, and it is very typical of his brand,” he said, referring to the signature on the Putin letter. “I was signing documents with a very expensive pen and it didn't write well,” Trump said in a 2018 HBO documentary in partnership with Axios. Reddit and X users were also wildly speculating whether the first lady used an autopen—which has become one of the president's go-to attack lines on his predecessor Joe Biden. Earlier this year, Trump began accusing Biden of using the mechanical device to sign pardoning documents, rather than doing so by hand. Trump claimed, without providing evidence, that Biden had no knowledge or approval of the documents. “Did Melania use Donald's autopen?” asked one X user. “The autopen can only have one signature preset,” jested another. Unfortunately for the autopen conspiracy theorists out there, until there is a definitive answer - it will remain a mystery. “If [Melania] has an autopen, we don't know about it,” Baggett concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With over 300 episodes to choose from, there were bound to be a few episodes of Supernatural that were helmed by members of the show's cast. Yes, the Trickster was behind nearly a dozen episodes in the show's back half, episodes that helped Supernatural stay relevant in its declining years. Speight's role on Supernatural really took a turn after the actor (who long held aspirations of being a director) helmed his own short film, America 101. "I used that short film to crack into the commercial world," Speight told Variety, adding that every commerical he directed, he would send to Supernatural producers Robert Singer and Phil Sgriccia. "I kept them abreast of everything because I wanted them to, A: see that the short film wasn't a fluke, and B: show them that I was serious about it…" From there, Speight shadowed Singer, Sgriccia, and other directors until it was time for him to tackle his own episode. Speight would end up directing a total of 11 episodes of the show, tied with Guy Norman Bee as the show's seventh most recurring director. Speight's big break came with Season 11's "Just My Imagination," a comedic look into the concept of imaginary friends that felt like an episode Speight should've guest-starred in as the Trickster. Again, Speight more than proved himself capable of commanding the Supernatural ship, and he would be invited back for Season 13 as well — but this time with a twist. During his six-episode guest arc, Speight's second episode that year as a director was "Unfinished Business," where he played the dual roles of Gabriel and Loki, the pagan god whose identity the Trickster had stolen years earlier. "What I found helpful was compartmentalizing — because to look at it as one giant elephant, it was more than the brain could comprehend," Speight explained later. After Gabriel was killed off for real, Speight returned to direct two episodes of Season 14 and a whopping four episodes of the show's fifteenth and final season, having impressed the showrunners enough with his off-screen abilities. It's no secret that Supernatural's later seasons are not considered the show's best. From uneven plotlines, hard-to-ignore retcons, and stories that often retread the show's golden years, the final Dabb and Singer Era is generally thought of as its most uninspired. And yet, this is the era of Supernatural where Richard Speight Jr. thrived as a director, perhaps because he does so well to focus on one episode at a time. Even when he helmed episodes that spoke to the show's greater mytharc, like "Gods and Monsters" in Season 14 or Season 15's "Our Father, Who Aren't In Heaven," it was his vision for the show that came through. "Proverbs 17:3," for example, is a standard hunt on the surface, but through clever uses of camera and intense direction, it quickly stands out among the show's final episodes. To say that Speight was vital to Supernatural's final years would be an understatement, as his relationship with the show's cast and crew created a natural environment for creativity. When speaking with Nerds & Beyond, Speight revealed that he took many directorial cues from Singer and Sgriccia, who hold the most director credits on the show. "That was very illuminating because you do start to see a style," he explained. "I think sometimes we as TV viewers don't realize that directors are bringing a flair to the show because their episodes are not back to back." It's true that certain directors can bring unique show-defining tones to a show. Both Singer and Sgriccia (who had been with Supernatural since Season 1) certainly added emotional layers and visual distinctions that suck with the rest of the program, ideas that Speight would utilize and expand on in his own work. It also helped that the actor-turned-director worked very closely with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki early on to thrive as a new-coming captain. "I had a pre-episode dinner with Jared and Jensen, who understood the task that I was facing and volunteered early on to 'let us help you,'" Speight told Variety. After "Just My Imagination," he'd shown that his potential behind the camera was perhaps even greater than his work in front of it. The actor/director took great care to breathe new life into Sam and Dean's adventures. It's no wonder he was brought back for more when The Winchesters came around, and has continued to direct since. Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Martin does have a pretty full plate at this point. ‘Public Domain' will feature Ruth Connell, Rob Benedict, Richard Speight Jr. and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a free-wheeling interview with Rajat Sharma in 'Aap Ki Adalat', Bageshwar Dham chief Pandit Dhirendra Krishna Shastri expressed his desire "to study about ghosts and paranormal activity at Oxford or Cambridge University". In the interview, Bageshwar Baba also revealed how his mother blessed President Droupadi Murmu by putting her hand on her head and saying, "May you achieve higher posts" (Aur oonchey pad par jao). Pandit Dhirendra Shastri disclosed several hilarious anecdotes about his stay in London, his meeting with the New Zealand Prime Minister and his extended fortune-telling session with the Mauritius President. Asked on which subject he wants to do his PhD study, Dhirendra Shastri said, "My idea is to do some PhD work in either Cambridge or Oxford University on ghosts. I know all of you will laugh. In Oxford, Cambridge and several universities of the US, there are studies going on on paranormal subjects. My work is to dispel ghosts (bhoot bhagaana). In our country, some members of Andha Shraddha Nirmoolan Samiti of Maharashtra pointed fingers at me, and the same day I made up my mind (to study). Till now, whatever I am doing is due to the blessings of my Guru. By linking with science and doing a PhD on paranormal activity, I will dispel negativism among people." Pandit Dhirendra Shastri recalled how he had told his mother not to put her hand on the head of President Droupadi Murmu because she is the Head of State. Dhirendra Shastri said, "My mother is not literate; she lives in a village. When Rashtrapati Ji visited Bageshwar Dham on February 26 for darshan of Balaji, she attended the 'havan'. I replied, 'My mom is in the village, but because of police security protocol, she could not come.' My mom met Rashtrapati Ji in the green room. I had told my mom in advance not to put her hand on her head, as she usually does. When the two met, Rashtrapati Ji told her, 'You are very fortunate to have such a son, who is helping so many daughters to marry.' She put her hand on Rashtrapati Ji's head and said, "Aur oonchey pad par jao." I caught my mom's hand and said, 'She is the First Lady of the nation, and there is no other post above that.' Rashtrapati Ji smiled and said, 'Let her bless.' It was a great moment (abhootpoorva kshan). She did not take it amiss and smiled. She brought a saree for her and said, "Bahut accha hai." At his meeting with the New Zealand Prime Minister in June this year, Bageshwar Baba said, "The New Zealand Prime Minister came to meet me. I was tense, and there was pressure on my mind about what to speak. "I will only give this advice to our people: do not commit the mistake that I did. Whether you give clothes or not to your kids, do give them education. It's not that we can't learn English. We have the desire to learn, and at the same time, we should support Hindi and Hindutva." Asked by Rajat Sharma how he took out the 'parcha' (note) of the Mauritius President when he didn't know English, Pandit Dhirendra Shastri replied, "In Mauritius, I met both the President and Prime Minister. One of my disciples said, 'Guruji, it'd be better if you gave them blessings.' I was in two minds about what to do. I said, 'I will try to understand what is being said for the first 15 minutes.' Then my engine will warm up within an hour. I prayed to Hanumanji, and he kept my 'laaj' (shame). I told the translator, 'Tell him that such and such "lafda" (problem) is there, and there is something which I cannot reveal before others.' He sent away his security personnel and closed the door. He, the translator and I – three of us – sat for one and a half hours. I was served nice tea and water. I chanted Jai Bajrang Bali in my mind. He later told me, "I never knew hamare sahab ke itna raaz hain (my saheb had so many secrets)." Asked why the Ambanis sent a special plane to Australia for attending Anant Ambani's wedding reception in July last year, Dhirendra Shastri replied, "I was called there (bulaya gaya). The manner in which they arranged their 'vivah parampara' (wedding tradition) and mangalik karya and made the 'utsav' a 'mahotsav' with Sanatan sanskriti (culture) is amazing. There are many rich (ameer) people in our country, but their ameeri (richness) should be such that you have sadhus, leaders, actors, sants, and mahants all getting due respect and honour. When they said, 'You have to come,' and when he (Anant) said, 'I won't become a 'dulha' unless you come...' He calls me Dada... He replied, "Aap tension na lo, aapki katha pe hum plane bhejenge." So they sent this big Cheel-Gaadi (chartered plane). There was an arrangement to take a bath inside the plane. Hum toh bhagwan se keh rahe they ki aise har baar bheje jo jo humko bula rahe. Ab aapne nahin bheji (to attend Aap Ki Adalat), woh aapki kami hai." Rajat Sharma: They sent a Rolls-Royce to the airport? Dhirendra Shastri: The second time when I went to Vantara, there was a small event. (To tell you the truth, whatever I have got is not my father's.) I sat in the Rolls-Royce car. When Rajat Sharma showed him pictures of him wearing branded glasses and a jacket, Dhirendra Shastri replied, "No, it was only one. My disciples give them to me. They insist, saying, 'Guruji, aap ek baar pehen ke dikha do, hamen khushi hogi.' I think, yeh bura nahin hai. When I am not a sadhu, there is nothing wrong in wearing them." Shastri went on: "If rapists in our country can live in bungalows worth crores, if naachne wala can live in bungalows worth billions, then what's wrong if somebody gives a chashma to a sadhu? Woh bhi jee sakta hai, yaar. But yes, I do not have aasakti (attachment), nor anasakti (non-attachment); I don't have apeksha (expectation), and mana bhi nahin (there is no prohibition). Forget Rolls-Royce, did anybody show the news about how I travelled in a bullock cart in Maharashtra? We have done much good work, but nobody showed that, but everybody discussed my glasses and my jacket."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UFO whistleblowers say witnesses have been silenced and even murdered, according to a claim now drawing FBI attention. Within an hour of seeing a flying saucer in the sky, army personnel turned up at a school to cordon off the woodland area. By and by, alleged “men in black” showed up and scorned the children in the principal's office for fear they would consider blabbing. There has been no mention of murders in Australia regarding the 1966 event, but in the US, cold cases may tell a different story. For the first time ever, an FBI director is reportedly investigating whether UFO witnesses have been bumped off to diminish a case. Kash Patel's background in intelligence equips him as a unique investigator who can finally look into potential murders and cover-ups, albeit covertly. Even if one case similar to that of the Australian affair uncovers a single dispatch, or homicide, of a witness, then the shift from conspiracy theory to criminal prosecution will be underway. As you see in shows like True Crime or Mindhunter, this allows for the power to subpoena documents, compel testimony, and open federal murder investigations. Perhaps the most prominent whistleblower of them all, David Grusch, crucially told Congress in July 2023 that he had “personal knowledge” of people going missing or being killed – in order to conceal UFO technology. When pressed whether or not assassinations occurred, Grusch said he would only reveal these kinds of details in a classified setting. Matthew Brown went one step further on the weaponized podcast by claiming “lethal actions were taken” against individuals who “knew too much.” Matthew Brown said on the same podcast: "If all of us die or are imprisoned, the seeds have been planted, and more will come,” which suggests a ruptured whistleblower community. It's nearly impossible to pin down names or numbers, but the fact that so many whistleblowers come from the military makes them uniquely vulnerable. Careers can be derailed, reputations destroyed, and in the darkest allegations, lives cut short. Hence, the need for a thorough investigation sooner or later. A dataset allegedly containing 15.8 million PayPal credentials, including login emails and plaintext passwords, was posted on a popular data leak forum. © 2025 Cybernews – Latest Cybersecurity and Tech News, Research & Analysis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The work was a collaboration between scientists at Penn State and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which analyzed how alien observers might detect Earth's deep-space transmissions. “Considering the direction and frequency of our most common signals gives insights into where we should be looking to improve our chances of detecting alien technosignatures.” Using NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN), which tracks communications between Earth and interplanetary spacecraft, the team compiled two decades of public transmission logs. When reviewing the logs, the team focused on deep-space transmissions to space telescopes and other spacecraft, while ignoring low-Earth orbit communications, as their low power would make them far less likely to be detected by a distant civilization. The most common targets for Earth-space transmissions were Mars, followed by Sun-Earth Lagrange points, positions in space where the Sun and Earth's gravities keep telescopes in relatively fixed positions from an Earthly perspective. ”Based on data from the last 20 years, we found that if an extraterrestrial intelligence were in a location that could observe the alignment of Earth and Mars, there's a 77% chance that they would be in the path of one of our transmissions — orders of magnitude more likely than being in a random position at a random time,” Fan said. When not observing a planet alignment, however, these chances are minuscule.” Fortunately, this is something that astronomers are already largely doing, as the darkening of a star by a crossing exoplanet is one of the easiest methods for detecting such bodies. “However, because we are only starting to detect a lot of exoplanets in the last decade or two, we do not know many systems with two or more transiting exoplanets,” Fan said. “With the upcoming launch of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, we expect to detect a hundred thousand previously undetected exoplanets, so our potential search area should increase greatly.” To build on this, the team proposes cataloging exoplanets within 23 light-years whose orbital planes align edge-on with Earth. The researchers add that other methods of communication — such as laser-based systems now being tested by NASA — could also be detectable, though their spillover signals would be far narrower. AI-Controlled Fighter Jet Takes Flight, Marking an Unprecedented Breakthrough in Autonomous Aviation “Humans are pretty early in our spacefaring journey, and as we reach further into our solar system, our transmissions to other planets will only increase,” said co-author Jason Wright, professor of astronomy and astrophysics in the Penn State Eberly College of Science and director of the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center. “Using our own deep space communications as a baseline, we quantified how future searchers for extraterrestrial intelligence could be improved by focusing on systems with particular orientations and planet alignments,” Wright concluded.

Anna Paulina Luna's interview on The Joe Rogan Experience Podcast #2365, August 13, 2025. JOE ROGAN: So what did you think about the whole UFO thing before you got in the office? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So I actually had, when I was stationed at Portland Air National Guard, my job there was an airfield manager. And so there had been an airspace incursion that had taken place when I was still at the time at the Guard. And I remember talking to some of the pilots about it and I was like, “What was that?” And they're like, “We can't really talk about it.” No one really wanted to address it. And so that kind of was my perspective. So like, for me specifically, I didn't look at it with a crazy lens and perspective. I'm like, you know, you never know if we're the only ones out there, essentially. JOE ROGAN: But why did you assume that if it's a top secret incursion that he couldn't talk about, that it wasn't just a military craft from another country? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Because of the way that he was discussing it. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So he didn't want to, from what I gather, get taken off flight status. And he's like, “I really can't discuss it. And so that was my first from a military perspective, experience with someone who basically, you know, there's a stigma within the flight community. JOE ROGAN: But doesn't he have instrumentation on his jet? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, at the time, right. So an older platform, but he really didn't want to even talk about it. The Eglin Air Force Base Investigation And I bring that up because now with our investigation and the task force that I run, actually the reason why the task force was formed was because of an event that happened at Eglin Air Force Base where both myself, Representative Matt Gaetz, and Representative Tim Burchett actually had responded and gone to investigate multiple Air Force pilots that had come forward in regards to UAP incidences that had occurred. And they were alleging that the Air Force was covering it up. And I'm happy to go into detail on that one. But what I will tell you is the stuff that I saw at Eglin, how the military responded, me being a former service member, and then ultimately what I saw with the pushback of the military not even wanting to share with Congress information, which is a big problem because when you have Congress that's supposed to be the advocate and voice for the American people, the oversight body, and you're being denied access not just from a base commander, but high level up at the Pentagon, even Secretary of Defense, it's a problem. And of course some information is going to be classified. But I can also tell you, and this might sound crazy, but based on our investigations and stuff that we've seen, there is definitely something that I think would rival what we know currently with physics and a tech that potentially is out there that we don't have the ability to reproduce because it would basically be like dropping a cell phone back during the time of maybe caveman. So we just don't have the tech to develop it yet. What I can also tell you is based on our interviews, and this has been something that you can go back and watch with the congressional hearings, but I was actually able to ask some of the witnesses, “What are these things?” And they keep saying interdimensional. And then when you talk about the interdimensional aspect of preexisting, maybe outside of what we currently know as our own dimension, that stuff can all sound crazy. But at the end of the day, my job as an investigator is to receive all the information, decipher it, and then ultimately, from a congressional aspect, if you do have contractors that are withholding information or operating outside of the purview of the federal government, I mean, there's budgetary issues, but there's definitely something that I can tell you with confidence that exists that we don't know how to explain currently. JOE ROGAN: So when you say that it operates outside our understanding of physics, what specifically are you saying? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Like, what happened to, I guess, break it down in simple terms is that I think that some of the tech that exists, that whatever these things have, these energy things. They call them interdimensional beings, I think that they can actually operate through the time spaces that we currently have. And then also too, I think that there's this historical aspect of, you know, this gets into the deeper theories and concepts of religion and I think the history that we currently know. And that spins off into another topic of, you know, you have the modern day Bible, you have this aspect of bibles that are books of the Bible that have been removed that explain and touch on these topics. I think that we're in a time and age where you have such a vast amount of information that we have access to via social media, via your cell phone, via the Internet. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So based on testimony, would be based on witnesses that have come forward. But what I can tell you is… And what I can tell you without getting into classified conversations is that there have been incidences that I believe where very credible people have reported that there have been movement outside of time and space. Look, have I seen a portal open? Have I seen a spaceship personally? Have I seen evidence of this? Have I seen photo documentation of aircraft that I believe were not made by mankind? Is there multiple events that go back to, I would argue, maybe even before the time of Christ that have documented this in text? So do I believe that the government has access to certain technology? And I believe that certain contractors potentially have back engineered this tech. But I also believe that this is a dangerous level of hidden information from the American people. Because if you have an aspect of the federal government which I can tell you, I, with two other members of Congress, were denied access to information at Eglin Air Force Base pertaining to whistleblowers because of the fact. And we can get into that story and what happened at Eglin in a second, but we were denied access and told that we don't have security clearance or the read-in authority on a special access program. That's a problem because I'm supposed to represent and be an investigative body. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I think it's been decades of classified secret information and also this aspect of the intelligence community that's been empowered and it's serendipitous with timing, because when you talk about the intelligence communities and what they've done essentially to the trust in this country with the American people, I think this goes all the way back even into JFK, with how they basically have operated outside of the purview of Congress and basically, to an extent, have gone rogue. You're seeing a big push and pull to try to rein in these intelligence agencies currently. Like what kind of evidence have you seen? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I have seen photos. JOE ROGAN: What have you seen photos of? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So I was in a SCIF and I can't discuss all that was in a SCIF. But what I can tell you is based on the photos that I've seen, I'm very confident that there's things out there that have not been created by mankind. JOE ROGAN: It seems crazy that people have access to information that shows that there's something outside of us that is more intelligent, at least more capable than we are, and they hide it from everybody else. Government Disinformation and Project Blue Book ANNA PAULINA LUNA: What I can tell you is that when you have thousands upon thousands of people around the planet throughout time that have reported something, right? To say that those people are crazy, to say that, you know, the whole concept of even just asking the question, that you might not necessarily be psychologically sound, that in itself, you know, that's a disinformation campaign to get people to shut up about it. We know that the US Government has not exactly been clean. And a lot of what they've done with the American people, specifically to the topic of UFOs, you have… If you think about the motivation they had with Project Blue Book, when J. Allen Hynek was running Project Blue Book, this specific intention was to discredit all stories. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And he ended up ultimately, though, after all of his investigations, becoming someone that was like, “I think there's something here.” But that's true, by the way. A lot of people might not necessarily go onto Google and look up that information, but you can actually look up the declassified reports from Project Blue Book. What's also interesting, though, is when we're talking about tech, right? The ability for this tech being that it exists to change dependence for entire governments on things like fossil fuel, et cetera, you know, it's… Look, I think everyone has a moral obligation to do what they think is right, okay? And so if you're in a position of power and you see something wrong and you're not addressing it, I think, you know, this in itself, getting the truth out there for people to decide for themselves. I'm not telling you what to believe. I'm just telling you in our investigations and what we are pushing for in regards to transparency, I would like to see the federal government roll out some of the stuff that we've been given access to, because I think that that information belongs in the hands of the American people. And it's not even just the US Government. I mean, there's other countries around the world that have done certain things like this. Now, look, I've had a lot of crazy people show up at my office and say, you know, “I've been to Mars. You know, I have a chip in my brain.” All this stuff. JOE ROGAN: They all have chips. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We had this one guy that showed up that was trying to give us a USB. He's like, “Put this in your computer. They're going to kill me for this,” runs away. But based on our investigations, what I will tell you is, you know, there's been two members of Congress that are actually helping to lead out these investigations with me. And the reason I say that is because up until last Congress, if you even said the word UAP or UFO, people actually told us that if we went forward with these investigations that we were going to ruin our political careers. And so, you know, we're in the mindset of, “Well, why wouldn't we ask these questions?” And also too, if no one wants to touch it, there has to be something here. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And so in these investigations, I mean, the amount of people that will come up to us, very successful people, to multiple members of Congress that believe the same thing, it's definitely changed in regards to the stigma that used to exist about disclosure and all this. And we're trying to get a screening up on Capitol Hill. But look, I think a lot of people say, “Well, this is a distraction from everything else happening in the country right now.” And all I'm simply trying to say is it's not a distraction. The people that are kind of helping to divulge all this information, you have an intelligence community, you know, Tulsi Gabbard, Radcliffe, Kash Patel, they have been truly, in regards to our other investigations, extremely transparent and wanting to get this information out. So part of the reason why the task force was formed pertaining to things like UAP, pertaining to things like the Jeffrey Epstein stuff, pertaining to things like the JFK, MLK and RFK investigations, is because even though we don't hold declassification authority, what we're trying to do is push these agencies and be, if you will, the pit bull and the attack dog on trying to get this information released. And we have gotten one specifically on the JFK stuff and we're still looking to declassify and ask specifically on the UAP topic. JOE ROGAN: What would be the rationale for keeping a photograph of a known absolute, not of this world craft from the American people or from the world? Why would anybody think that that would be the smart thing to do is to limit the access of that information to a very small amount of people? But then also too, I think when you are talking about these things for a lot of people, I think that it kind of can rock your world a little bit in regards to where you stand in a faith perspective and then also to an aspect of, “Well, how do you even begin to explain it?” And all I'm going to say is look, and we can go into some of the books that were removed from what we know as the modern day Bible. But I read through the book of Enoch multiple times. And I'm not saying that these things are angels. Okay, that's not at all what I'm saying. But what I am saying is that depending on where you are in regards to your whole perspective on whether or not God exists, I believe in God, I'm a Christian, there has to have been and there's admission that there was other creations that God made, but that we were the most prized creation. And so I think that this can open up a bigger topic of discussion. What I will say is that what's been interesting is, and I've had a mass array of people that have come in, right. We have people that come in that claim that you can use this ability to basically dog whistle these things in from a psychic ability. JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I've heard people say that. Otherwise they wouldn't necessarily be able to provide some of the video evidence that they have. But then that also brings up the question of if these things are interdimensional, which we've had witnesses testify to, to members of Congress and that was all publicly out there, that would then bring up the whole, “Well, if this is really transcending dimension, the power of what you say, thought, all of that.” And then, you know, you can look into our own government's declassified documents that the CIA had on different experiments. I mean you can literally, last week I was going through actually on a Friday night, just put my son down and I was going through some of the declassified documents. And so I believe it's called Stargate and it was talking about, you know, the basically psychological experiments where they were trying to basically remote view and all that. Why would our own government be looking into that if there wasn't something there? And so I'm appreciative to all that information being publicly out there. But I think this whole idea and stigma of trying to make it sound crazy when people actually have these questions that needs to stop, which is why the task force is in existence. And then also too they need to release information. JOE ROGAN: If I was going to play devil's advocate, I would say that the government would look into that to find out if there's anything there. And that would probably take a long time if they're really being careful. So if I was going to fund a program, if someone told me that there's some people in Russia that can remote view military sites in America, I'd be like, “Are you sure?” And like, “Yeah, yeah, there's a technique involved and we know the technique and we want to fund some sort of a study to see if we can do it,” I'm like, “Let's go. What do you need?” Because if maybe it's real. So I don't buy that they wouldn't spend money on it unless it's real. I say they would spend money on it. And so if you look at all those declassified files, you know, you can pull up and this is just wild, but there's one where I was looking through and they had basically, you know, the Coast Guard had called in. There was a ship that they had been given information on that was running drugs. And so they called in one of their remote viewers and they're trying to give coordinates of the ship and actually locate these things. And actually I was laughing because I was reading this off the website and I'm telling my husband, “Imagine, you know, you're trying to run drugs and then all of a sudden you have some weirdo at Langley in a basement. They're like, ‘No, just here's the coordinates.' JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I don't know if they write things down or type them out or what, but I talked to Hal Puthoff about it and he said they used it to very specifically find the location of a downed Russian craft within a couple kilometers, which is nuts if you think about the area where this thing crashed. It's remote wilderness, the middle of nowhere. And this is a problem with people. They don't want to get duped and they don't want to look stupid. They don't want to look naive. They dismiss that there might be frequencies that you don't tune into all the time, and someone might get really good at that and they might be able to see things remotely. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I think that this gets into the bigger discussion of what do we know, right? Going back to some of these books that were moved, there's a good podcast right now called the Telepathy Tapes and it talks about how some non speaking or nonverbal autistic kids actually are exhibiting telepathy. JOE ROGAN: You mean the Telepathy Tapes? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, sorry, the Telepathy Tapes. Nonverbal autistic kids are exhibiting telepathy. But you know, I think based on what we're seeing now, based on the fact that our own government's looked into it, based on the stuff that you were saying, I mean, you can find all this information publicly available and it's out there and I think that there's something to it. And so, you know, we're seeing, and we've heard this is in non classified settings, we've heard from people that have come forward that are saying, “You know, we're being able to via meditation, we're essentially downloading information and we can communicate with these things.” Granted, you know, when I'm sitting in my congressional office and I'm hearing this, I take it with a grain of salt because we do get a lot of crazy people. But when you have people that are high level executives, very successful, clean cut, not on drugs, they're coming in and they're telling you this stuff and then, you know, you're kind of cross referencing it with various people in intelligence agencies, I just, I think that there's something there. We need to be at least open to hearing the discussion and the argument for these things. I think you owe humanity a service. You're supposed to release that photograph. There's no reason why a small group of people in the government should have photo conclusive evidence that aliens are real. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And there's an over classification aspect of this too, right? If you're serving in the military and you're taking a photo on your personal device or a video on your personal device, that shouldn't be the purview of the federal government and either which way, I mean, there's been now so much stuff. There's, granted there's been a lot of fake stuff put out there, but the stuff that is legitimate that we are seeing, the stuff that we had people testify to in our congressional hearings, I mean, that's not a joke. And what's even more interesting to this is that I was actually able to talk to David Grusch, who now is actually working with the task force to kind of chase down a lot of these leads in regards to some of these contractors that allegedly have this tech, right? So in talking with him, again, not in a SCIF, we were able to actually flesh out that prior to him testifying that he actually received very real threats against his life and his wife's life. And then shortly after he testified, there's this massive smear operation that was launched against him to try to discredit his testimony. And so, you know, again, going into, “Well, if this stuff wasn't real or if he wasn't telling the truth, why would there be this massively orchestrated effort to, you know, completely just disprove what he was trying to say or to discredit his actions and his testimony.” And so it is kind of coming full circle, right? I mean, we're conducting these investigations simultaneously and we're doing this in addition to everything that we have to do as members of Congress. And so I've again had some great investigators who are working with us on oversight, as well as a lot of cooperation from the intelligence agencies. JOE ROGAN: I think the first break in the wall was that 2017 New York Times report where they were talking about it in logical, sensible language that these things might be from another world. But I think that movie that you're discussing, which is the Age of Disclosure, right? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, I haven't seen it. And it doesn't even have any UFO footage. And at the end of it you kind of draw this conclusion like, “Oh, this makes sense.” What they're essentially saying is one of the problems is if they have been funding these secret programs, then for all these years they've been misappropriating money. And they've been lying to Congress. JOE ROGAN: And that's super illegal. But you know, is Congress going to do anything about it? Because it's not the first time. So as a, this is my second term in Congress now, but as a first term member of Congress, you know, when you get elected to Congress, you would think that they would bring you in and they'd say, “Okay, this is how you do the legislation.” No, you get elected, you show up to kind of a crash course for about like a week and a half on how to not get in trouble with ethics and then you're basically wined and dined by lobbyists. Basically the only rules that you're told are never vote down a rule which is a procedural motion to bring legislation to the floor and don't really ever vote against your party. Within the first week I broke both rules and so I was on the naughty list, per usual. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, they tell you basically those are the two rules and don't go against that and you won't have any issues. JOE ROGAN: Those are big rules though. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, because it's like, you know, you're supposed to represent your constituency. Representative instead of just do what the party wants. But you know, there are mechanisms that have existed since Thomas Jefferson who wrote our rule manual that enable us to actually pass legislation and actually hold agencies and people accountable from a punitive perspective. And I don't know if you were tracking, but I brought a vote on the former Attorney General for basically refusing to testify to Congress and respond to a subpoena. And that was called inherent contempt. A lot of Congress was like, “What the hell is inherent contempt?” It hadn't been done since the early 1900s. And I actually read it in the rule manual, and I read the rule manual twice. So it's crazy what happens when you read books. But we were able to find this out, and it was a mechanism that Congress can use to actually basically send the sergeant at arms to go arrest people. JOE ROGAN: Okay, so one of the things that this documentary was calling for that I think is the only logical way to solve this is a mass amnesty for these people that misappropriated money and… The real crime is you keeping this secret from humanity. It's just interpretations of what you're writing down on paper. But if you ask the general public how they feel this should go, a rational, normal person would say, “There's no way the defense contractor should be the only people who know that we're not alone. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Especially when we're facing a massive deficit and you see that they're like, the Pentagon hasn't been able to pass the audit, and I don't know how many… JOE ROGAN: All that stuff is great, but just for humanity. No one should secretly keep information that would change our entire perspective on our existence. What I will tell you, though, is the issue that we have with bringing forward legislation that would give mass amnesty and pardon to these people is that there are people within the intelligence community and within Congress on both sides that will try to… If you come forward with this, and I'll tell you a very plain, prime example of this in a moment, that they will block it. They don't want it to pass. They will stop it from even coming to the floor. They won't bring legislation that will address it because they want to keep this information secret. JOE ROGAN: Why do they want to keep the information secret? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Because I think that their mouthpiece is in control of the deep state, and that's a thing. And it exists on both sides, okay? JOE ROGAN: So someone will come to them with marching orders. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: One hundred percent. Representative Tim Burchett, before I got elected, was kind of on his own little island in regards to the UAP stuff. And he will himself tell you that, you know, this is one hundred percent a thing, and that these defense contractors and what he believes, you know, the Pentagon not passing all these black budget programs. He will tell you he's been leading out this effort way before I got there. He had a piece of legislation that was supposed to enable the FAA to report and develop a different reporting procedure for UAP stuff. And at the time, the chairman of intel ensured that that legislation was not brought forward, was stopped. The piece of legislation that actually passed out of the Senate really had no teeth to it. And then Representative Burchett drew a primary challenger that was being backed by the chairman of Intel. And so, you know, when you are touching these, it's like that meme where you have that stork that's like, “don't touch this.” And then the little foot comes out. It's kind of like what we're doing. And it's not exactly easy because you will take heat from both sides. But there has been a good group that's been assembled that's bicameral, meaning it's both in the House and the Senate, and bipartisan, meaning both Democrats and Republicans are saying this should actually happen. JOE ROGAN: Are they publicly talking about not releasing the information or is all this stuff done in secrecy? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's done behind the scenes. JOE ROGAN: Because if they had to do it publicly, if they had to announce their position on it publicly, it would be very damaging, I think, to anybody's political career on the right or the left. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: People would be pissed. JOE ROGAN: Well, they're pissed because I'm pissed, because if they've had it for this long, if they really did recover something as early as 1947… ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I can tell you for us specifically, we actually were made aware some people had come forward that said that they wanted to brief. So about two years ago, when all this kicked off, we had requested briefings from AARO, that's in charge of kind of compiling the investigative aspect of UAP stuff. And by the way, from the get go, even in talking to AARO, I was like, “This organization is literally a BS organization. They're never going to tell us anything.” And every interaction that we had in the SCIF, I was like, “This is a nothing burger.” But then these people came forward and said that they were actually denied. They were told to not brief our group specifically on this topic, and that it was from at the time, members of House leadership, but they wouldn't say who. So it's done behind the scenes, you'll see these random little troll blockages that might pop up. But what I can tell you is that with the new administration, specifically with the FBI, specifically with ODNI, we have gotten transparency to where previously we would have been stonewalled. And so what I will tell you is we are going to push for the information that we sought to be out there for the American people to see. JOE ROGAN: So do you think that the whole idea of disclosure is maybe a multiple step, very agonizing, frustratingly slow process rather than a big dump of all the information that they've had from Roswell to the Aztec one to this? During that same time period, there was a really prominent UFO recovery thing that was not as publicized as the one in Roswell. So then they had to backtrack and then they had to do the press conference where they had scattered pieces of a weather balloon that didn't look anything like a UFO, and then there's nothing. JOE ROGAN: But meanwhile they flew the wreckage to Wright Field. They flew the wreckage and Truman met them there, supposedly. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I can tell you in our hearing we were actually notified. I think it was one of the witnesses had talked about what had happened at Vandenberg Air Base where there was this thing that appeared over the base. It had phone calls into law enforcement from hundreds of people. And whatever had appeared over the base was basically bigger than a football field and basically a cube, a red cube with some weird thing in the center of it. I actually had our witness draw this out. This guy is sober as a priest. I mean, was a great pilot. It seems like a sci-fi movie, but based on the evidence that we've seen, I don't have any reason to believe that these people are lying. Based on the evidence that I've seen from our own government, I think that there's something there that the American people deserve to have access to. And so I've been… This is not just on this topic, but again in other topics as well. This has been my perspective: transparency is what builds trust. Other governments have revealed certain information on it. To think that we are the only life form on this planet or in this galaxy, I think is a little bit crazy given, you know, the fact that I also think God exists and that there's other creations. But then again, you get into this aspect of, you know, why is it that you also have this aspect of a certain religion that has been very controlled and I think rolled out in a certain aspect. And you know, when you have certain books that are removed because they don't think that people should have access to this information or know it, you know, why remove a book from a Bible, right? Are there people that don't believe the Book of Enoch was really a part of the Bible? I don't remember how he discussed the missing books. Because you have to really understand the history of the Bible to be able to figure out what's legitimate, what's not, why they put it into the New Testament. I had some very erroneous ideas about it until I talked to intelligent people that really, really know the history of it. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, so from what I gather, and by the way, I'm not a theologian in any capacity, but just from my personal opinion on this, so you have the Ethiopian Orthodox text, which has I think 88 books of the Bible in total, but in the Ethiopian Orthodox text it's basically kind of the mainline OG version of the Bible. And then sometime in the 4th century there was actually a group that came together and they removed certain books. And the story goes that Revelations actually had replaced Enoch. And so it's interesting because when you're looking kind of full circle on, you know, you hear the stuff that some of these people are talking about and then you see and you read the Book of Enoch, which is a wild read, okay? And then you look at kind of what our modern day description is of what angels and entities are versus what Enoch was seeing and reporting in his language and ability at that time. I just, I think that there's a lot that brings you to then ask the question, “Well, why would they remove this information, if it's truly, you know, written in part of the oldest Bible in the world, why would they then take it out and water it down?” And I'm not saying that you can't find God through the new Bible, right? Everyone's on their own spiritual journey, and I think everyone can pray and you can access God. But I just find that very interesting. And so what I will say is that I want to have the whole kind of picture in front of me. The Dead Sea Scrolls and Biblical Authenticity JOE ROGAN: Yeah, I just don't know about the history of it. Is there any debate about the reality of that book? Because I know there was some kind of controversy that Westhoff described. I just can't remember it. I just looked through a transcript real quick. I didn't see you guys discussing Enoch. It must have been me privately talking to him about something. A thousand year old story that's exactly the same written that they didn't know there was a version of it a thousand years ago. And then they find it in these. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And the fact that this kid, you know, shepherd kid, was able to even find these scrolls that they were set up and you know, just led to that point right in time where he finds this massive, basically admission that the Bible is real. You can actually look into, you know, there's a new King James and then you can actually look into the Catholic Bible as well that also has, they call them Apocrypha texts because the King James Bible doesn't acknowledge them. But there are also other books that are not considered, you know, approved by the King James. So look, I was on my mom's side, I was actually raised Catholic and then had my catechism, did all of it. And then on my dad's side I was raised Christian and then later on Messianic Jew. And I've been exposed to a lot of this growing up, but it's definitely interesting. I don't believe that because I at the end of the day believe that God is responsible for our creation. And I think that once you kind of remove yourself out of this basically rat race and you can like really reconnect with that, I think that that's when you kind of realize, hey, there's a bigger purpose here in life and like, what is our end objective? And if you're given a position of influence or a position of power and you're not doing the right thing for humanity, you're not guiding people, then that's something that you have to answer for. I think all of these people are trying to document a truth. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, Enoch talks about that. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, I've looked into that. But of course, like we're focusing on other things right now. So we're not using tax free dollars, but just go check it out. JOE ROGAN: I think the remote viewed. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They remote viewed it. You should actually find that in Ethiopia. They weren't able to locate the actual. You should ask them to pull it up. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I don't know. JOE ROGAN: Decades old CIA documents on Ark of the Covenant resurface amid classified group text spat. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Wait, like it was a group text. JOE ROGAN: Argument that caused this stuff to be. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: No, check out. I think it's like the New York Post. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, there you go. This is wild because it actually goes into descriptions of angels too. Well, if you scroll down now that's that you can probably click on the scribed because it'll show you all the documents from the actual declassified file. JOE ROGAN: What year was this? This was like a couple months ago that this Just kind of came all out. But what year Was this project? We don't know if they bought them. JOE ROGAN: Who was president back then? Okay, so scroll down and then you'll see that. So they're going through in the notes. He's like drawing where it is the remote viewer. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So you have like the different things that are describing it. JOE ROGAN: It's like showing the peak of a wheel. So that's interesting because if you look into actual. So there's like a wheel text. If you look into Enoch's description of angels and Ezekiel 2, I think that that's kind of a tie, but go down more. So but yeah, you have like the actual. They should have like a cherubim drawing somewhere down here. So that would be the seraphim. And so he's going through describing. So these are the hand notes for. And then actually says that it's in the Middle Eastern country. But this is actually from the CIA. If you go up and these are actually the handwritten notes on what was described by the remote viewer. And you have to go through the entire document. But yeah, that's what's described surrounding the Ark. JOE ROGAN: Do you know what they asked him to find? You can find it on the dock. JOE ROGAN: You have to go look for the Ark. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: If you go higher up in the documents, it's over there. But if you ask me to go look for the Ark of the Covenant, like, I know what I'm looking for. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, apparently these remember what. JOE ROGAN: I think it's going to like, show me that they fucking found it. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I don't. JOE ROGAN: I don't know if they did either, but it's like it's interesting. But it's not as interesting because you're saying, show me the Ark of the Covenant. So he's drawing what we all saw in Indiana Jones, or can you locate it? No, it had been in the same time period. When did Indiana Jones come out? JOE ROGAN: I don't know. You know what it looks like. You know what the Ark looks like. So if I tell you, go draw me the Ark, where's it at? JOE ROGAN: All we have is some scribbles on paper. Unless they actually went there and found it. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, what's interesting and I should probably ask Radcliffe, like Radcliffe, can you tell me this? I never look at an Ark of the Covenant. JOE ROGAN: What are you saying, Jamie? The tasking is to see mission statement training. And then this dude apparently set keep AOL to a minimum. I saw that on the paper earlier. Have to be careful with editing, though. Just something to watch for attained. Has another container inside of it. The target is fashioned of wood, gold and silver. The target is similar in shape to aol. Coffin and is decorated with the Seraphim Sea sketch. This target is located somewhere in the Middle east, as the language spoken by individuals present seem to be Arabic. Well, wouldn't you want someone who could fucking decipher Arabic to do this? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We don't know how far it went, and I definitely have questions, but this would not be the first time that a government would have looked for something. Especially because people theorized that the Ark of the Covenant had these abilities as a super weapon. JOE ROGAN: I know, but I'm saying the remote viewer is limited by his ability to understand the language. Individuals in the area were clothed in virtually all white, had black hair and dark eyes. One figure I honed it on wore a mustache. See, the only problem I ever have with these things is if these places are all controlled by terrorists and zealots, you know, dictators and crazy people over there. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I think there's this aspect of, if you look at it from a biblical perspective, no one would be able to access it anyways because it would be protected. JOE ROGAN: Cannot be opened until the time is deemed correct. Individuals opening the container by prying or striking are destroyed by the container's protectors. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, what's interesting is, remember in the Bible it always talks about how there had to be… JOE ROGAN: Through the use of a power unknown to us. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They had to, you know, go through this special process of being considered, you know, holy basically to access it. I think that obviously God's real and this job has definitely, you know, put me in a position to where we're able to help get other truths out there, if you will. JOE ROGAN: You need to get the truth of that thing out there. And you could explain a lot of things. Look, if these Ethiopians have it, which Graham Hancock believes allegedly they do. Yeah, Graham Hancock believes that they do. And he said that these guardians, they all get cataracts, they die of radiation poisoning. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I mean, there's something to be said about the Ethiopian people as a whole. And going back to the Ethiopian Orthodox text, actually when I first launched this task force, I actually went and I met with an Ethiopian Orthodox pastor, if you will, just to kind of see and explain and ask questions that I can't exactly go to, you know, the Smithsonian and ask. And, you know, his response was interesting, especially from their perspective. You know, you have a lot of this aspect of, I think, religion that tries to be doom and gloom. And then in the Ethiopian perspective, he's like, “First of all, your timeline's wrong.” And I'm like, “What do you mean your timeline?” He's like, “Well, the biblical text in modern day Christianity, it's a little bit off. So we use a completely separate. I think it's 364 days out of the year” and he's explaining all of it and he's like, “But even then. So, you know, we don't have the perspective of, you know, we are in the end of days, et cetera. But, you know, the way his perspective just seemed very optimistic as opposed to pessimistic and filtering and controlling information, all that stuff.” JOE ROGAN: He's probably not online. He's not subjecting himself to the New York Post. JOE ROGAN: The thing about that says that the viewer was identified with a target and didn't know what it was being. After all the explanation they found. So that whole thing at the end of it was what they were saying it was when they wrote it in that report. Hearing how they put off talk about it. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They kind of talk them on, right? They'll give them something and say “walk us through.” JOE ROGAN: I'm just doing devil's advocate because I have no skin in the game. There's some extra thing that's happening with human beings, the way we're all connected to each other that we don't really totally understand. I think that might be an emerging aspect of human consciousness or an aspect of human consciousness that's atrophied. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Or just an aspect of spirituality that we've previously forgotten because we're in such a digital age that kind of programs you into the rat race. And I think people, the more that they're kind of, you know, there has to be more to life than just a 9 to 5 and, you know, working for this aspect of materialism. Don't get me wrong, I like, you know, a nice car and a clean house and all that. And if you have kids, I think that's one of the things. And it's when you're a parent, it kind of makes you realize, wow, there's this aspect of love that I didn't know existed before. And this aspect of, you know, us being able to have those little quantum breadcrumbs is what I call them. Have you ever been talking about something and you'll go somewhere, hear something, and there's confirmation of what you've been talking about, or, you know, something happens and you're asking a question, then all of a sudden it pops up kind of. And I think that those little things, just when you're on the right path and doing what you're supposed to do in this bigger picture. JOE ROGAN: Yeah, well, it's a good way to live life if you believe that. I wonder why some people seem to have the idea of it being an emerging aspect of human consciousness. Our ability to sense things and know things that are going to happen, or premonition or know if someone's a liar or a weirdo instantly. So discernment in the Bible, you can talk about, you know, this aspect of being. People say, “Oh, if someone has really bad energy,” you picking up on it, there's something to that. But I think that because, and it's really happened, I think, in the last 40 years, where people are kind of forgetting that. But when you actually go back to, for example, we're talking just now about the Ark of the Covenant, the Ethiopian Orthodox text and all this, there's more of that aspect of spirituality that I think has been removed from society. I think it's actually taken away our ability to really respect one another and value human life. And I think that from a political perspective influences decision. Those people are usually not that spiritual, and they really don't have a value for life in that aspect. JOE ROGAN: Yeah, no, that's definitely a real thing. JOE ROGAN: That's probably the scariest part of it. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I actually had a really groundbreaking conversation. So the way I'll describe Congress is because you ever have a job where 80% of it, 90% of it's just really eating shit, and then the 10% is really cool. JOE ROGAN: That's when I hosted Fear Factor. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Okay, so that's it. That aspect of, I think, really exists in politics, if you actually care. And I had a meeting recently where I was with two other members of Congress that were helping me with the JFK investigation. And I bring that up because at the time of the JFK assassination, the KGB had actually come forward with their own independent investigation, and they actually gave it at Kennedy's funeral to U.S. officials. And it's my belief that the CIA actually destroyed that information and evidence because it would have confirmed what the KGB. And mind you, at the time, JFK was actually in talks with the president of Russia at that time. And his perspective is that he actually wanted to do joint mission between the US Government and the Russian government to the moon. You obviously saw the Cold War was happening. So for them to be able to say that Kennedy, who was not a Communist, but that he was a Communist sympathizer, and “how dare he talk to these dirty communists.” I mean, that in itself would have given them any ammunition to turn a blind eye, or at least not fully figure out who assassinated Kennedy. There's a summit on the 15th, actually, with President Trump and Vladimir Putin. And I think the aspect of, you know, anytime you have peace and trade, it's way better than war for everyone involved, for the people of Ukraine, for Russia, for the American people, and I think for the surrounding regions. I recently got back from meeting with government officials in Romania and Moldova and it didn't matter if. And I actually met an actual member of the Moldovan government who is a communist, an outward communist. And it didn't matter who I talked to. And then when we had met with the European Parliament and the EU, some of them wanted peace. So if you have terrible policy perspectives, obviously you would advocate for something like that. But it just goes to show that the people that are going through it, the people that are living it, that are directly impacted by it, no one would advocate for war. And so in even just having this conversation, you know, a lot of people, even, you know, two administrations ago, maybe two administrations ago, probably would not have had that conversation. So they agreed to release that and they'll be posting it publicly for the American people to go through later on this fall. JOE ROGAN: Have you seen it yet? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I haven't, so I'll be seeing it at the same time everyone else does. The Russian Government's Assessment of Oswald ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So when I was talking to the ambassador, he's actually a history buff too. And so he had actually said that the Russian government, when Oswald was actually in Russia, had done a psychological profile because they thought, you know, they're like, “Is this guy part of American intelligence? Like, what's his story?” And they thought he was basically nuts. And apparently he tried to go hunting when he was out there and they were observing him and he couldn't shoot for shit. So they're like, you know, “He didn't meet our psychological profile.” Then he shows up to the Russian embassy in Mexico City with a gun and they're like, “What the hell is that? And then we find out simultaneously as this is all happening, that the CIA, kudos to Director Radcliffe, had actually released something called the Joannidis file. And George Joannidis was actually… He's basically our version of James Bond, but more corrupt. And he was basically observing Oswald. This was all in his file. We had admissions from the Warren Commission, people that had been subject to the Warren Commission's investigation saying that the Warren Commission engaged in witness intimidation. The single bullet theory never exists. The CIA administration that Lee Harvey Oswald was not a lone gunman. People ask, “Well, you know, does this mean that you'll ever get the name of who killed him?” No, because I don't think the CIA was like “kill JFK on this day and use this gun and have this person assigned.” But there was evidence of multiple shooters for sure. JOE ROGAN: Well, there had to be multiple shooters. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We had testimony to that. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And actually what's interesting is when we first launched the task force, we had left leaning news outlets that were trying to write hit pieces saying that I was basically launching a conspiracy theory task force and they had to print the truth weeks ago. JOE ROGAN: What is it about people that don't want to believe that some conspiracies are real? Is it you just have such a rigid worldview and in your mind that there's always been Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, specifically to JFK. JOE ROGAN: If you're Geraldo Rivera, you know, when Dick Gregory brought that film on the Geraldo Rivera show and you got to see the Zapruder film and you got to see what looks like a shot that makes his head go back and to the left. People say, “Oh, Lee Harvey Oswald couldn't shoot.” You don't have to be that good with a rifle to be you're on a ledge so you have a secure rest if your rifle sighted in and they said his scope was off, but that doesn't mean shit because you could just drop your scope and it's off. Like all you have to do is take your rifle off of that ledge, drop it on the ground and now that scope is off. You never drop your gun like that. You can knock your scope off. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, there's multiple problems, though, because the Warren Commission actually never even put into the report. JOE ROGAN: But let me finish. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Let me finish. JOE ROGAN: My point is that wasn't a far shot. No, you could kill a guy like that. And he could have been the shooter. He could have been one of the shooters. But I think there's too much witness testimony. And they found a guy who got hit in the overpass. He got hit with a ricochet. So now they knew that bullet couldn't have hit Kennedy or Connally. So how do you attribute all these wounds to two different guys? From multiple gunshots to a single bullet. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's a magic bullet. JOE ROGAN: Don't you know, you have to find this bullet that fucking for sure didn't hit any bones. And there's more fragments in Connolly's wrist than they were missing from the bullet. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, what's interesting is, is the Warren Commission did omit multiple female witnesses who were actually at the Book Depository that day that actually stated that they had never witnessed Oswald actually in the location or going down the back of the Book Depository. JOE ROGAN: Yeah, it's possible that he could have snuck past them. There was a lot of chaos. You hear gunshots, the President shot. People don't always think straight when things are going nutty. Like, he might have been there or he might not have been there. He might have shot at Kennedy or he might not have shot at any. But for sure, he was some sort of government operative. JOE ROGAN: He was traveling back and forth from Russia. There was a lot of weird stuff. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: He was under surveillance by the CIA, so there's a lot there. What the official narrative was, we now know is BS, right? And that I thought from the beginning. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, but a lot of the American people did. But to have their own government say “No that's not true.” To gaslight them and to push this narrative of “If you question it, you're wrong, you're crazy.” That in itself, I think, when you're talking about, like, why do the American people not trust their government? It's really this fracture that starts around the Kennedy era and timeframe. And you can see then that distrust kind of evolves. But why do you… Going back to your original question, why do people refuse to kind of question conspiracy theory? Maybe there's some substance to it. And I think it's because it's more comfortable for people from a psychological perspective to live in this comfort area, that their government might not do something like that or might not try to cover up something like that, because that's just an easy way of life. JOE ROGAN: But look, it's too scary. But the fact is, is that, look, I've traveled a lot, I've dealt with a lot world leaders. But it doesn't mean that we can't call out and hold our own government and officials accountable. And so that's kind of what I've guessed. My mission has been this Congress and what I hope that it will continue to be. But I'm not trying to do this for, like, even the next 10 years. So for someone like me, you know, people are like, “Oh, initially, you're going to ruin your political career talking about this. Why would you even want to do that?” And then, you know, they're seeing all these big wins coming out in regards to transparency. And I will say, had it not been for the secretaries that have been appointed by this administration, this wouldn't have happened. Because under President Biden, he actually also tried to declassify things pertaining to JFK, and the National Archives never released it. JOE ROGAN: That's not a good sign. None of that stuff's a good sign. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They were up until recently, and we're still documents that the JFK community, because, mind you, I'm actually working with… His name's Jefferson Morley. But on this issue, we're working great together. And he's actually been helping me. JOE ROGAN: This is a hugely bipartisan. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, it's super bipartisan. JOE ROGAN: This is something we can all get together. It's the one thing Democrats and Republicans both completely agree on. Who killed them and are they real? Those are two giant questions that we all have. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I think they're real. The other part is still outstanding, but hopefully when the documents are released from the Russian government later on this fall, that might be able to provide a full picture. But at the end of the day, we have a good mosaic that's been put together with at least the documents that have been released with this administration and for any outstanding documents, actually have a team assigned to me from the CIA that is actually helping me chase down these documents. And I've already had some interesting experiences. Like, not creepy, but, for example, after President Trump signed the executive order, and Radcliffe has been super helpful, we actually were made aware of this. And the archives is like, “We don't have any documentation of this.” The CIA says they don't have any documentation, and they've been good with us so far. So I go to the archives because they're like, “We found this weird bag, though, and it's in this SCIF, and it's been here for five years, and it was left by our former attorney for the archives, and so we don't know what's in it.” And I was like, “Well, go open it.” They're like, “Well, we don't have the key, and it's in a vault.” And I said, “Well, I'm coming over.” So I drive over, literally, like, put my son in the car. I pull up this bag, and I'm like, “Does anyone have scissors?” And we, like, cut open this little folder, and there was a CD ROM in it. And this has, again, been declassified now, so I can talk about it. But there was this CD ROM of a ton of wires from the State Department. Some of the wires were pertaining to the Kennedy family, and it was actually a WikiLeaks document. And so I think the reason why it was kept at the archives is because you're not actually supposed to have these documents on government computers. WikiLeaks obviously don't happen with that. But here I was like cutting it out of a bag at the National Archive. JOE ROGAN: That makes sense that you would have the most top secret documents burned on CD ROMs. That way no one could ever get access to it by hacking into your computer. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: To this day, I don't know. Even who left the CD ROM, I don't know. And there's some other stuff in that that I don't need to get into. JOE ROGAN: But why don't you need to get into it? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I won't get in trouble. And I think I saw recently Tulsi had actually talked about some of the State Department wire that had been found that… And I think these are the same ones that had talked about the assassination of RFK. There were wires going up from the State Department prior to his assassination, which is interesting. JOE ROGAN: What do you mean by that? Like how did they specifically discuss it? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, that's… I haven't seen the actual wires themselves yet. But what that would imply is that the State Department knew about the assassination before it took place. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And that was something she talked about. JOE ROGAN: Did you get into the MK Ultra stuff at all with Jolly West? MK Ultra and Operation Paperclip Connections ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And I look at that on my free time, but that's not the purview of the task force. But there is stuff that you can. JOE ROGAN: That makes sense, right? And I'm reading this to my husband. JOE ROGAN: Because for sure the Nazis were experimenting on drugs with people. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They were doing a lot of bad stuff. JOE ROGAN: Oh, they were doing a lot of horrible stuff. And if we took some of that and applied it, the Jack Ruby connection to it is that Jolly West went to visit Jack Ruby after he shot Lee Harvey Oswald. And Jack Ruby was pretty rational before then. And then after Jolly West leaves, he's freaking out, seeing things that aren't there. I think he said something about Jews burning. He could see Jews burning alive. Like a psychosis state full on lost it. Most likely got dosed with acid. Most likely Jolly West just hit him with a shot glass of acid. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: That's a terrible way to go. He went so far off the deep end. I think he died a few years later of cancer. But I think he completely lost his mind after Jolly West visited him. And Jolly West was involved with the Manson family thing. He was involved with Operation Midnight Climax, where they had brothels. And they would get these johns to come in with the prostitutes, and the prostitutes would give them acid. They knew these people were never going to say, “Hey, you did that to me. Dosed me up with acid.” Because they're not going to admit they went to a brothel. So you have the perfect group of people to victimize and just try stuff on. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, and they got in trouble for it, too. The CIA had to do payouts. They were getting sued for it. And then when all this did flush out, I mean, it's always economically. And then they found a bunch of documents. I forget Tom O'Neill, who wrote the book “Chaos,” goes into great detail about this. It's all about the Manson family and MK Ultra. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, even just this conversation right now, there's such a stigma that exists around it because it's such a spooky topic. JOE ROGAN: And so you don't want to look stupid. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: You don't want to look stupid. And so look, anyone watching this can go look at this information, go to CIA.gov reading room and know it's not going to be a phishing website that's going to steal your information. But you can find for sure it is. But it's always been one of those things. And if people ask me, I'm just very transparent about it. And I will say something that started out with a stigma of being this conspiracy theory investigation, wasting taxpayer dollars, has been arguably one of the coolest task forces in Congress, I think, and we have a lot of good people that are behind it. JOE ROGAN: And I think the tide is turning on that kind of thinking, that these conspiracy theories are silly to pursue. Also, there's a time honored tactic of taking. Look, if I was an intelligence community, and I'm not accusing anybody of doing this, but if I was an intelligence community and I had some truth that was very inconvenient to a narrative, and I wanted to label that truth as being a preposterous conspiracy theory, I'd add a bunch of kooky stuff to it. Dole it out to the craziest people. This guy's got a drinking problem. He's got a conspiracy theory website. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Or take a little and spin it to him. You're going to give him some insider. Get him to spread a bunch of kooky stuff so that when that stuff gets disproven, the other thing's attached to it so the other thing looks stupid, too. The one thing I wanted to do when I first got the task force is open up a SCIF to any person who held a clearance to come brief us on what they knew about UAPs. And I can tell you that we've now had. JOE ROGAN: What was the first conversation like, when the door shuts and you're like, “Oh, boy, I'm…” ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, the problem. The problem is I've reached out to some of the biggest names in UFO lore, okay? Meaning, the day that the SCIF was open, that we reserved it, we're here. Maybe someone let them know that maybe someone hung something on their door in the middle of the night. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But if people say they're going to go tell us in a SCIF and then they don't show up, it's a problem. JOE ROGAN: But maybe those people don't feel like the government's going to protect them. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: That is one of the biggest things that we've had people bring up is that you're a whistleblower, but whistleblower protections only go so far and you can't do anything for my physical safety. And some of them do allege that there's these actual physical. We actually had someone that we wanted to bring in to testify because our next hearing on UAP is going to be, I believe it's next month. And the individual that was actually told to us by David Grusch is actually a former combat controller. And so my husband, Air Force special operator, combat control. So we knew the guy via some friends. So we knew that the guy wasn't nuts or crazy and reached out to him and he did not want to come in. JOE ROGAN: Well, also, you put those folks on TV, right? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, we don't have to. JOE ROGAN: Yeah, if it comes time where they have to testify and there's a lot of time in between people finding out this guy came and told you guys what's up to testify. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Don't freak out our witnesses, Joe. This is why what I was talking about is what's being advocated in the documentary that to me makes perfect sense is mass analysis, amnesty. Now, here's the bad part for sure. You're dealing with enormous sums of money and I'm sure people got really rich off of that. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: What the back engineering potential. I mean, and also the competitive advantage you would give company A. If this company gets access to a downed craft that can traverse space and time, that can move through the universe instantaneously, that utilizes an unknown element that has some unknown process of defying gravity. It's utilizing no interior mechanisms of control. And these are the kind of things they find that getting to a contractor would be a massive advantage over the other contractor that also should be on equal standing with the government. Do you divvy up your spaceships in between these folks? Are they the only ones who get to know it? The Eglin Air Force Base Incident And that brings us to what happened at Eglin Air Force Base. So, in a nutshell, we had been told by. So Representative Gates had come forward and said that he had two or three pilots had to contact him, saying that the Air Force was covering up information regarding to UAP activity in the handle, and he wanted us to go with him to invest. So we show up at Eglin Air Force Base. We're met by the base commander. So this was under the last administration, so you can't just cancel a meeting and say you can't come to the base. So Gates actually was on House Armed Services at the time that oversees the U.S. military. We want to see the evidence, and we want to have the pilots that saw these aircraft, whatever they are, or these spacecraft, we want to have briefings from them. In a nutshell, we get to Eglin Air Force base, they keep BSing us about the Chinese spy balloon. That's not what we were there to see. And ultimately, we were in the SCIF. There was many members of the intelligence community. We then go back upstairs to the conference room and proceed to, again, basically have it out with this commander. And Representative Burchett said, “We could do this the easy way or the hard way. But it was at the time. JOE ROGAN: I like it when people use a movie. And if it's the hard way, you're going to have Representative Gates and Luna in D.C. questioning you. So I suggest you do it the easy way. He got nervous as we were talking to him, and he, I kid you not, he goes, “You know, they're going to like that. I'm not going to let you see it.” So he was thinking out loud, but didn't realize that he was basically saying it. And then in the middle of our meeting, he gets up and leaves the room like, “I have to go to the restroom” or something. And then maybe five minutes later, this tech sergeant comes in and says, “Oh, the base commander's been authorized to go and leave to Georgia. He won't be coming back.” JOE ROGAN: Said out loud, “They would be happy that I'm not telling you.” ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Going to get in trouble. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But here's the problem. Even if it was someone at the. Because at the time, this got pretty high level. How our government functions is the military does not decide what the civilian sector and what representatives can and cannot see. It's not supposed to function like that. So he got up and left. I've never seen, in the middle of a congressional delegation. JOE ROGAN: What state were you at the time? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We were in Florida. What the hell are you doing? Representative Gates has gone on record. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I should be able to tell you without losing my clearance. JOE ROGAN: Well, not just that. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Which is why we have to declassify. The Hal Puthoff Study on UFO Disclosure JOE ROGAN: Which is why you know the Hal Puthoff stuff. Hal Puthoff during the Bush administration was assigned. He was one of many scientists, and this is also in the age of disclosure. He was one of many scientists that was assigned to put a numerical value to pros and cons of UFO disclosure. So they said to him, “We have a crashed UFO that we have been back engineering and we want to release information to society to let people know that UFOs are real and that there is something else out there that's not us. It's much more intelligent than we are.” So they have this list of pros and cons, banking, religion, societal structure, everything on one side. And he said, “I would have loved to have had disclosure, but this was just what they asked me to do. They asked me to compile numbers and to do it in a way that's super objective.” And he said if I'm doing my job, this is where I think it would completely wreck our government, completely wreck any idea that the people that are in charge of us have any position of authority when there's something that can go 100 million times faster than we think is physically possible through the universe, appear out of nowhere, stop all of our nuclear programs, shut down bases, do weird shit. Society's Spiritual Evolution and UFO Theories ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But don't you think that that's where it's been interesting because society has moved away from this aspect of having a spiritual grounding and even believing in most people today think when you talk about praying even that whole concept, it's kind of just poo pooed. Granted I'm not a scientist, I'm not running numbers, but just based on how we've kind of been evolving with access to information and the questions, the discussions that have been happening, not just here, but I think internationally. I just think a lot's changing now to say that we were, and I've heard some wild theories like people think that humanity was seeded by UFOs. And I don't agree with that theory. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's an interesting theory. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I'd put it out there because that's what. JOE ROGAN: Right, but what would that do for your belief system? JOE ROGAN: But would it suck really? Maybe that's what's confusing about the Bible. Maybe what's confusing is that it was an oral tradition for hundreds, if not a thousand years before it was ever written down. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I think that it depends on what book you're talking about. JOE ROGAN: So like the Old Testament, if you go back to the oldest works of the Bible, weren't most of those stories handed down generation after generation and then eventually written down, written into texts? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, some of them are written by prophets and then. But I mean, Enoch is apparently supposed to predate even the time of Genesis. JOE ROGAN: Well, the nuttiest one is Ezekiel. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I'm telling you, Enoch is even crazier than Ezekiel. JOE ROGAN: Did you find anything about whether or not Enoch is controversial? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: You can look up the 4th century. JOE ROGAN: It was excluded as well, I guess since the fifth century, it wasn't in canon. JOE ROGAN: And why did it get excluded? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But what's interesting is, is that even if that's the case, though, you have the Ethiopian Orthodox Church that actually there's Ethiopian Jews and that's considered the most pure form of the Bible. So you actually have a division of the Ethiopian Jewish class that actually recognized Enoch. JOE ROGAN: How weird is it that some rabbis 500 years ago made a call? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But that's what I'm saying is you can't discredit. JOE ROGAN: It's kind of weird, but you can't. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Discredit it because again, when you have people removing books, I just, I think, look, and I'm not telling people what to believe. I'm just saying you should take a look at it. JOE ROGAN: Oh, here it is. The book is considered to be heretical. For example, Enoch is midrash of Deuteronomy 33. Particularly detailed descriptions of fallen angels would also be reason for rejection from the Hebrew canon at this period, as is illustrated by the comments of Trypho the Jew when debating Justin Martyr on this subject. ‘The utterances of God are holy, but your expositions are mere contrivances, as is plain from what has been explained by you. Nay, even blasphemy infamous for you assert that angels sinned and revolted from God. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So it was a. JOE ROGAN: It seems like some people made a decision that something shouldn't be in there. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, but that's the thing is it's a disagreement in religion and perspective, but they should have still not removed it. And so it's interesting because then you have the evolution of what the King James Bible is. He wanted to get remarried, they rewrote it. But you even have the Catholic Bible that has. You have the Catholic Bible that had books that were taken out, and then we have the King James. You don't have access to God. But I am saying that there's a bigger picture here that we need to discuss. The Impact of Human Editorial Decisions JOE ROGAN: Well, there's always a problem when people get involved and when people get involved in making decisions that this could be real and this could not be. Imagine a world in which if Enoch was left in the Bible and people were like, “Wait, what happened?” Explain the nuttiness of the book of Enoch to people. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Okay, so if you read it, it talks about the fall of angels, thus creating really the precursor of civilization that led to the first flood. I think that when you even go into potentially the technology that was given to mankind by these angels, it talks about the hidden beliefs and theories in astronomy, metal workings, all of it. But it really does explain, you were talking about earlier how you have a lot of these religions around the world that kind of say the same thing. This is kind of the OG text that leads to those stories that we're hearing from many religions around the world to talk about angels mixing with mankind and then seeding a super essentially race of humans that essentially were responsible for basically damning mankind to the flood. I mean, you hear about stuff in Greek and Roman mythology, people who had these super crazy powers, and you talk about it out loud and it sounds crazy, but that's what the book says. And then the fact that it was taken out and then it's poo pooed. You have the Catholic Church that has books that are missing out of the King James Version. I'm just saying that when you read it, you should read it and decide for yourself. Don't listen to what I'm saying. Don't listen to what you're saying, but truly give it a chance and see what you have to say. And then you're going back to this whole concept of if you have this information pertaining to UAPs, whatever they might be, the origins, I mean, if you have an understanding of what Enoch was talking about, kind of makes sense. JOE ROGAN: Well, I go back to my thoughts on all this stuff. It's like very few people could even read back then. You're probably not writing necessarily to deceive people and make up a story. So the question is, with all this stuff is what was the original truth that they were trying to write down? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And there's a thing. JOE ROGAN: And is it possible to even understand what they're saying without understanding the language? JOE ROGAN: But he did it because, “I want to know it in that language.” ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I mean, that's smart, because there's always an aspect of translation where you lose certain implications. JOE ROGAN: And whoever was writing it down the earliest. You're closer to their depictions of what that truth is. Then after King James starts fucking around with it and all these other things. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Want a new wife, got to remove her Instagram? JOE ROGAN: People start getting involved. But boy, when you go to the really old stuff, the really old stuff is very strange. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: The Orthodox, I'm telling you, the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible, I actually had a staffer that went to Ethiopia, she was on a church trip and she actually brought me back a copy and she's like, “You can translate it via Google translation.” So kudos to modern day technology. So I have it in my office and actually when I did my swearing in, I actually did my swearing in on the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible. JOE ROGAN: That's kind of crazy. You know, I would wonder what the impact to all these religions would be if we had definitive proof that we're not alone. Like if there was an introduction, like some sort of an event where they decided, “Look, this government is too secretive with all this information. Just let me show you real quick.” And then what does everybody do now? Like what happens to the Mormons? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I think that brings us back to… So by the way, I'm by no means saying that aliens are God. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But I think that brings us back to the fundamental question: do you believe that God exists? Because if you do, then you realize that our freedom, the freedom of choice, is not a man given right, but a God given right. And I think that goes back to the fundamental principles of what we believe in true representation. So if you believe that God is real, God is powerful, then it shouldn't be a king or a man that you're looking to, but to God for divine inspiration and to make your life decisions. That's ultimately what freedom of choice is. JOE ROGAN: But I think even the Catholic Church has acknowledged the idea that if there is intelligent life somewhere else, it doesn't mean that God didn't create it. JOE ROGAN: Maybe God just didn't tell you about the neighbors. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, it does say in Enoch, and then also in Genesis that “the stars cried out.” And so if you're looking, well, a star, if it's not… what do they mean by stars crying out? And then Enoch actually alludes to stars in certain capacities being potentially angels. Now I'm not saying… and this is kind of interesting because, you know, I've had this aspect of my task force, what we've been investigating, but then I have my personal beliefs and my religious beliefs. And what I'm telling you is that in my position officially, I've seen men pervert information to get what they want. So it's not unlikely that an entire, very secret, very truthful text was omitted in an effort to control population and to insert yourself between individual's relationship between them directly and God. JOE ROGAN: If it doesn't agree with your interpretation of God. And this is the issue with these rabbis, right? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I mean, if you're having people determine any information. You should not be able to do that. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: The UFO stuff. JOE ROGAN: No one should be the gatekeeper of information. JOE ROGAN: Especially something that should be for all of us. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I think we're probably going to be responsible for the Book of Enoch sales probably increasing on Amazon. JOE ROGAN: Well, I'm going to buy it. But the thing about it is, I'd really love to be able to read it in Aramaic. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: You should see if there's an audible source. JOE ROGAN: Oh, I'm sure there is, but what I'm saying is I really like the Strassman idea of learning ancient Hebrew to be able to read the source material. Because what were these people trying to write about? And if these people like Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson are correct and these folks that believe in the younger Dryas impact theory, the Bible was written a couple thousand years ago. These people that are talking about the younger Dryas impact theory are talking about a cataclysmic event that wiped out advanced civilization 11,800 years ago. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, Plato talks about it, hearing it from Egyptian teachers and then going back to the Atlantean civilization. Like, if you can get back to 11,800 years ago and read what they thought went down. Because I think that's probably where the oral traditions come from. The oral traditions come from complete collapse of society, rebuild over time takes forever. And then a re-understanding of what you know to be true about the origin of man and the birth of the universe and why we're here. And then you got to figure out what Jesus is. And then I went to Turkey to see the Sumerian inscriptions and carvings and what they thought the ancient Sumerian gods were, the Anunnaki, all that. What's interesting is in Enoch, it actually has reference to the Anunnaki, but a different… I think it's like Anu is the root term that's used for it. JOE ROGAN: Have you read the Zechariah Sitchin stuff? JOE ROGAN: Do you know of it? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I have heard of it. Well, I will say with all of that going back to… If you read Enoch and then follow about the fall of mankind and the angels… and this is Christian theology, right. So angels came down, rebelled against God, and bred with humankind, that would be, I think, a good starting point for what potentially the Anunnaki were. JOE ROGAN: Yeah, God probably didn't like that they were coming around and taking the ancient hominids and juicing them up. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Heaven did not approve. God probably says, “Look, you can go visit, but don't mess around with it.” ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, there's definitely something to be said. And so I think, going back to what is our job? Is government going to follow through and bring accountability? That's our job in the same sense, in that we have to ensure that if we are to truly have an equal and fair society, that you have to have this aspect of justice that has to be carried out. And I can go back to something that I found kind of crazy, but the mandatory minimums for child predators are not that high in this country. And so Congress can actually increase the mandatory minimums, but there's been a lot of lethargy about that. Some people are against the death penalty. I mean, you're involved in the disclosure of things that have questioned, that people have questioned forever. I mean, these are… Those are the huge questions that exist from the 1960s on: UFOs, JFK, Martin Luther King, RFK, those are the big ones. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We're looking for it and there's a good group of people that are signing up into it. I did say recently… So the MLK documents just came out and we're wrapping up our JFK investigation. So after we finalize the JFK investigation, we're putting out an official congressional report on our findings and people can read it and decide for themselves. But I think a lot of the MLK family was actually very concerned that we were going to go into extracurricular. It's to specifically expose what the government was doing if they knew about the potential threats. And people say, “Well, why do we care about…” I constantly get, “Well, we shouldn't care about this.” No, you should, because there has to be a check and balance. And when, if the CIA was operating outside the purview of the federal government, if you know that whistleblowers are being punished, if they need to be reformed to the FOIA act, all of this stuff, then we have to be able to put forward legislation to ensure it doesn't happen again. And what's been very interesting and almost serendipitous about the whole JFK investigation is you have President Trump now in the second term that's released all this information and multiple people, presidents tried to, but they were worked against by their own secretaries within these agencies, and then deep state actors that tried to block the efforts for release. And even though information hasn't come out as fast as we would like it to, the fact that they've made these admissions is really good. But moving forward into how do you prevent this from happening again? It's people really do… young people, especially because there's so much fatigue for people that have been in office for… And the reason I say that, I don't even want to do this for the next 10 years is because everyone, even people I've looked up to, after a certain amount of time, they lose their edge. And I think that's because you're up there, you're taking in a lot of incoming. But if you can put all your energy in it now and then you can cut ties and pass it on, that's how our founding fathers wanted us to do: pass the torch, stand up the next generation. But we have a bunch of career politicians that want to stay in office for 50, 60 years. JOE ROGAN: Yeah, it's on both sides. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So I'm trying to do a discharge petition now on term limits. So back in January of my first term, so back in January of 2022, I'm sure you saw there was this massive speakers fight about confirming Kevin McCarthy as the speaker of the House. And I was part of one of those 20 that said, “We're not going to vote for you just yet. All these policies were being consolidated in one person. They would basically cut off all aspects of fundraising in Washington. And the mainstream media for a while was like, “You guys are disrupting the process. You want us to just fall in line and not argue our principles? Last time I checked, you're supposed to fight for that. And so we were able to reform the institution. But one of the things that we had negotiated with the former speaker was we wanted a vote on term limits, and that never came up. And so now, because of our very slim majority, one of the slimmest majorities in US history, we have the ability to do something called a discharge petition, and it's where you can physically go down and basically collect signatures on a bill. And so I'm bringing forward two that have already been filed. And then the other one is banning insider trading. JOE ROGAN: Yeah, that's been talked about for a while. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But hasn't been done. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, it's not… there was a communications director meeting for the entire GOP and I'm calling up bringing a bill on banning insider trading. And we were not invited to that meeting. Our staff was excommunicated from that. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, I know some people are making money. It's crazy how openly corrupt that part of the business is. Why would you give that up? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: People say that it doesn't exist, but last time I checked, when you are given access to CEOs, when you're given access to information that are affecting markets and then you're on the committee that has purview over those bills, you do have information. JOE ROGAN: Like, for example, it seems like you have a little more than the average person. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And there's a lot. They go in making $175,000 a year, and then all of a sudden you come out, you're worth like $20 million, $200 million. The stock market is kind of gambling. The UFC doesn't even allow me to gamble and I can't even affect the outcome. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So you can't do it, but Congress can. JOE ROGAN: For now, at least the inside information that I have, anybody could have. Like, isn't Pelosi now worth $400 million? JOE ROGAN: She jacked up her portfolio recently. JOE ROGAN: Oh, yeah, no, she's just the poster lady. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I told my husband, I was like, “We're not going to do stocks because it's just…” That's the one thing you can talk to anyone. I actually was reading an article and the local press are like, “Rep. Luna is trying to force a vote on this.” Right. And so I'm always the kind of red headed stepchild usually with especially in dumb circles. But this one lady posted, I actually started laughing. She goes “Well a broken clock is right twice a day.” And I started laughing because I'm like it's such a bipartisan issue, like over 80% of Americans don't think that Congress should be able to trade stock. And it's true because we're given access to information and that's truly influencing your decision. JOE ROGAN: People are rabid and they're super upset now obviously because Trump's in office again. So that rabid nature has been over amplified. I think a lot of it though is driven by bot activity I think is really big. I can tell you that when I first launched the task force people were like “She's an intelligence asset, she's never going to release information” that it came out that I actually don't have declassification authority. But we have been able to produce and we are getting full cooperation from the executive branch. JOE ROGAN: There's real people along with those bots, but real people are also influenced by bots as well. JOE ROGAN: There's waves of negativity and positivity that go in certain directions that are orchestrated and there's companies that are known companies that you can actually hire them to go do stuff. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: They exist in Florida actually. There's a couple of social media influencers that have been approached. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: What's interesting though is it goes back to that you never want to get in trouble in a crowd of people because they'll just look at each other. You ever see someone getting beat up and they just film it, right? I do think X needs to do something at least be able to label bot accounts because I've seen it happen, especially on certain things like I had done something to allow new moms to vote. When you're recovering, our job is different. Only 13 women in US history have ever given birth. It's about to be 14 who are members of Congress and God forbid we enter a war or something. And so there was definitely bot accounts that were attacking me for that and accusing me of destroying the Republic. JOE ROGAN: But yeah, that's not tinfoil hat stuff, folks. If you were… Whether it's this country, a corporation, another country, why wouldn't you automate your system or have AI or even just have actual people that have a job and their job is to type inflammatory, whatever it is, insults, whatever it is. Why wouldn't you have a group of people that you have at your command if it's legal? What's interesting is the test, especially when you're running for office. It's kind of interesting because you'll actually… During my first race, I actually had a firm that I was going to for consulting and they had someone that had worked at the firm that had also worked with McDonald's branding. So people that are running for office will bring on these terms and then they'll give them kind of a branding profile. Social media at the time was kind of just resurfacing as if you want to be kind of influential, you have to be able to use social media, share your message and get that out there. And I think Trump really kind of refined that was kind of one of the leading figures in that, especially when Twitter 1.0 was in existence. But then you had this aspect of people that were running for office and then there was actually a censorship state in this country. And we found that out that Twitter 1.0 was coordinating with the Department of Homeland Security. We found this out actually in a congressional hearing where they were actually… And DHS had a division under that was supposed to be monitoring terrorist organizations and they were using it on the American people to censor information. You still have censorship issues in places like the EU so to think that they wouldn't use social media platforms especially to influence the masses is just… That's not a conspiracy theory. JOE ROGAN: Of course censorship is influencing. It's also causing people to self censor, which changes discourse. Not wanting to have conversations with each other. Well, you can get banned from Twitter for a variety of things, particularly during COVID but I think was also a great test case for them. Let's see, if there is some sort of catastrophe, some natural disaster, some national security issue where we could now enforce new regulations of censorship. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, and scary regulations at that. Because COVID was really kind of dystopian and going back to kind of, I think you'd mentioned foreign government influence using bots. The one thing that's been interesting is in our investigation so taking now my task force hat off and going into actually problems that we see right now happening. You saw this massive a couple weeks ago rift that was taking place between the American people specifically on immigration. And all of a sudden these pop up riots. I actually called them the Temu riots, like the Temu Chinese act, because it came out via actually this woman, her name's Data Republican on X. And she actually tracked down the funding line. And they were actually funding a lot of these riot pop ups in the area. So you had people that were being used divided, for example, on the immigration topic, you literally have them passing out, Mexican flags saying that they cared about immigrants, when in actuality the financial ties is actually coming from the CCP. So the Chinese government on many occasions, and it's not uncommon within Congress to know, even on apps like TikTok, they were showing certain information in order to cause a rift and influence people. This same individual, Neville Singham, actually once we got this information, we sent a request to have him come testify to Congress and he spends part of his year in Shanghai, China. And so we were not able to deliver him his subpoena basically. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And that, mind you, this is not… People and look, I started out before politics with my feet getting wet as an activist. That's actually how we started out in politics. But what's a problem for me is that you have foreign governments trying to cause a rift and then promote ideologies that will empower people specifically to push forward policy that will actually put us as second tier as opposed to the Chinese government. And I do think that the Chinese government in their execution has been very, very specific about how they want to hinder our ability to be global dominators. I think when you're looking at what happened in COVID time frame, right? But at the same time, if you look at what President Trump was doing, he was actually trying to negotiate trade with China and he was winning. And then all of a sudden COVID happened. Well, what was interesting second time around in Trump 2.0 is that you have all these Temu riots taking place at the same time. And it almost got no coverage in the mainstream media, but you had multiple Chinese nationals that were caught trying to release agro terrorism weapons. JOE ROGAN: Yeah, we talked about that stuff. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, agro terrorism weapons. And then at the same time the tariff war was taking place and then you actually saw them trying to infiltrate. So I don't think it's by accident, but I do think that it's important to remember that just because you see something happening on the mainstream media, the media will always try to amplify something because it's rage baiting and it's click and it's views which translates to money. But when you actually look at where the funding stream is coming from, it actually goes back to China. And this is not the only incident where they try to drive a wedge back between Americans and then actually compartmentalized with Hispanic Americans specifically. So in 2016, now the largest voting minority in the country are Hispanic Americans specifically of Mexican descent. And I think you can find that stat on PewHispanic.org so when you're looking at voting demographics, how could you influence an entire demographic to help skew or influence a midterm election? And it would be specifically probably on the immigration topic to try to race bait people. But then you have this aspect of the same guy, Neville Singham, his wife actually funds an organization called Code Pink. So this is all Chinese money now going to a separate cause. And this one specifically is on the Israel versus Palestine issue. They don't care about Israelis or Palestinians. And what they are doing is they're using that front in an effort to then divide on that topic as well. So it's a multifaceted approach using minority classes in order to actually push the end goal, which would be communism. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And also too you can actually look on the flyers for these organizations. So PSL Neville Seedingham is actually an open admirer of Mao Zedong. I mean like it's all up there and it's out there for you to find. But it's just crazy because most people, you know, you see this aspect of propaganda that's being shown to you and you're not going to be like, “Who's funding that?” You know, you're going to be able to say like, you know, tell with that person, “I'm going to fight for this.” But they don't actually realize the more nefarious perspective of what's happening behind the scenes. JOE ROGAN: So I absolutely believe this is true that I'm sure other countries fund similar things. But also it was in reaction to some of the ICE raids, right? I mean it was a visceral reaction that a lot of people had the idea of people just showing up and pulling people out of schools and pulling people out of Home Depot and pulling people that were just hard working people that maybe snuck over here because they didn't have a legal way to get over here. Because what people, when people thought about ICE, they thought “Great, we're going to get rid of the gang members.” They didn't think, “Great, you're going to get rid of a landscaper.” ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But the question is why didn't they do it then during why did these riots and why did this happen under. I'm sure these pallets of bricks that get left off on corners when they know that there's going to be a BLM riot, that's bananas. But to your point, so how do you fix something like the immigration system as a whole, right? JOE ROGAN: You definitely don't have an open border. That's crazy because you need to know if people are criminals that are coming in. You don't want cartel members coming in, you don't want murderers coming in and serial killers. Like there's a reason why we have borders. There's a reason why we have borders but the thing that freaks people out is like, how many corporations rely on illegal labor. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Tyson Foods is one of them. Yeah, we actually, last year I was putting out some messaging on them because I'd watched this documentary about the slaughterhouse and how they're actually using migrant children like 14, 15 in some of these slaughterhouses. And the lobbyist from Tyson Chicken Corporation contacted my chief of staff at the time and was trying to basically say, “Hey, basically back off.” But I don't care, it's wrong. I don't care where you're on the spectrum. JOE ROGAN: I'll tell you a story that a high level government official told me. JOE ROGAN: I don't want to, I don't know if he said it on here or not, so I don't want to say his name. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Wait, so he was on here. JOE ROGAN: Someone actually said to him that they don't want to stop the illegal immigration because they need cheap labor. I actually think that it'll never stop, at least not in college. JOE ROGAN: That they don't have to pay them any benefits. They don't have to take care of. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Their insurance or pay them at all. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I've heard cases where people, specifically contractors, will walk on people if they know that they're here illegally. And so going back to how do you fix this? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Is one of the top cases that I handle, aside from Social Security help and refunds, within my congressional office. So a congressional office does constituent services and it's basically like customer service. “Have you been victimized by the federal government? You know, call this number.” That's your congressional office. So specifically on immigration cases, if you've had an issue with the State Department visas, all that you can contact your local congressman. And so what I will say is that we've had people that have spent tens of thousands of dollars to come here, but it takes 20 something years to do. And that's part of the problem is there's been such an influx and such a bog down of the actual system that our actual system is not functioning at the capacity that it should to actually help people come here the correct way. JOE ROGAN: Well, especially poor people. And if you want to immigrate to the United States, the application, one of the things they ask you, “Are you an expert in something where people in the United States can't do it?” JOE ROGAN: Musician and no one else could sing your songs, maybe you could get citizenship from that. And I heard when you get across, you can get work.” What is that guy going to do? That guy doesn't have the money to hire a lawyer. How is he going to prove that he's more valuable than a United States citizen that's already here doing the exact same job? And I have heard, okay, on the floor, these are conversations between members that to a certain extent, especially when you're talking about an E-Verify system within the ag industry that actually members of that committee don't want that because they know that the farmers are actually heavily relying on some of these illegals to work in the building. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So I can confirm that. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, yeah, because you don't have the decrease in wages. However, I think the bigger problem that we have here though is that at least specifically in my district and then also to having argued this, is that this gray area that's been created, in my opinion, they don't want a solution for they do it intentionally with the understanding that both sides are going to fundraise off of it. I would say pause, let the system run through, take everyone in, vet them, make sure that they're not criminals, et cetera. But then the system allows time for it to actually catch up to itself and then you can continue as is. JOE ROGAN: What you just said was so scary that they don't want to resolve it because they want the issue to exist so they could fundraise for it against it. That's probably so accurate because anytime anything ever happens, one of the first things they do is “Please donate,” throw it up. All the people that are very reactionary, “I can't believe this is happening.” ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And you know what's crazy is most elected officials might send out that email, but the email fundraisers actually are taking 80% of that dollar. And it's like, I'm in the wrong business. JOE ROGAN: The scariest thing about nonprofits is how much profit they make. It's really weird when you see the salaries of some of these people that are nonprofits. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And they do nothing. JOE ROGAN: Or what's going on with the LA fire thing? I was like, Spencer Pratt for governor. JOE ROGAN: He's a little pit bull. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And then they promised. There's this fine print that he wrote. It's legal for them to operate like that. Where, you know, an enormous percentage of all the money that comes in goes to overhead. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And they did find. JOE ROGAN: But it's such a scam. It's such a weird scam and it's such a devious thing because you're pulling. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: On people's heartstrings, which is why, going back to what I said, we need younger people and we need more normal people to run for office. JOE ROGAN: We need AI to take over. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I don't know about. JOE ROGAN: AI is our God. JOE ROGAN: AI is our governor. That's what we'll say in school now. I think AI can be used in good senses. And I ask Grok things a lot and I will argue points, but I think we need to work alongside it because there's this aspect of AI that removes the humanity. I don't think you can teach AI empathy. And there's a certain aspect of humanity that needs to be kept involved in these decision making processes. For example, if you have a drone that's been targeted to, let's say, eliminate a terrorist at this grid location and it's functioning solely on AI, well, what's going to enable it to be able to pause on destruction of a location if there's children within it? But the US history of drone use is no better than what you just described. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, there are oversights and massive investigations, especially if it's in regards to civilian casualties. JOE ROGAN: Right, but civilian casualties are the majority of deaths from drones. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I would say based on the people that I've talked with and interacted. JOE ROGAN: People get in trouble for it's. They weren't the intended targets. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, and that's a problem. And that's where a lot of these people do. So there's massive investigations with the JAGs, et cetera, that get involved in these investigations. JOE ROGAN: I'm saying, would AI be better than that? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I think you can have. I think you can have an AI decision making process, but where there is a human involved in that step. So the AI would rank it maybe. And granted, I'm not an AI programmer, but I am saying that I think that there's an interface where you can have humans involved in the final. JOE ROGAN: Well, the most terrifying solution is not. That is don't use the missiles. Instead you have a chance drone that specifically targets one person. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, there's suicide drones. JOE ROGAN: But I mean even worse, flies through the house and lands on the dude's head and blows up. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Don't freak me out too much because the Chinese have a little spy drone that's literally this big. JOE ROGAN: And they just have bug drones, mosquitoes. Especially if they really have been back engineering UFOs for the last 40, 50 years. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I don't think that any other government is as advanced in regards to that topic as we potentially are. And I say that because if that were the case, then they would be the world superpower. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And Congress gets infiltrated? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: How many people have all of a sudden hot Chinese girlfriends? All you have to do is be hot and we're stupid. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: He's my biggest fan, that guy. They get information back to the CCP. There's that famous story I think Mark Andreessen told us about how was it in Berkeley? And so all these CCP people panicked because they were supposed to send the information back. Maybe your family gets a visit. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: The University of Michigan has now had two. I think those agroterrorism was University of Michigan. JOE ROGAN: It's all over the country they've been infiltrated by these governments have very cleverly inserted their ideology into these universities. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: The one thing that's been interesting is, and a lot of people aren't talking about, there's one representative member Republican from California that's addressing it, but when they have surrogates, have children here for US Citizenship, but then they take them back and fully integrate them and educate them in China. And so technically they're US Citizens, but they are being totally raised with the ideology and perspective of the Chinese government. JOE ROGAN: Working for the Chinese government. Access to all of our resources, everything. JOE ROGAN: And then we sell the Chinese government land around our military bases. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, that has been. I love our libertarian brothers and sisters, but I have gone into so many debates on this because they're like, “Well, we shouldn't limit an American's ability to actually sell their property.” And I'm like, “Yeah, but the Chinese government literally wants to eliminate the west as we know it.” And so we have to be cognizant of that. And also, it's not just buying a military installation. You think that they're not actually putting tech and observing, monitoring, pulling all of our resources? JOE ROGAN: Mike Baker talked about this on the podcast that they sell cell phone towers, Huawei to these companies. Well, Huawei, which they were really problematic, but they sell these cell phone towers near these bases. And so they sell them at a discount. And then the Huawei stuff was crazy because it actually had third party access built into some of their systems. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And a lot of the tech that they actually sell here, whether it's to our law enforcement. So anytime you have specifically, I would say, within even our craning and our actual shipping operations, those things are sending signals back home. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, we should be making. So there's policy chambers where if you have an American business, you can now actually get a big tax incentive for manufacturing back home. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: We just got to stay the course. JOE ROGAN: What a dumb idea. All of them get made in China. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It came out in the 70s for manufacturing. And I think that's where you're seeing this aspect of people that are very – if you talk about – and I'm not an isolationist by any means, but I do believe that we should have, especially with COVID everyone saw this. We should have certain things that are just manufactured here. I think tech is extremely important. I think Palmer Luckey's doing laptops or something now in the United States or trying to actually move that over. JOE ROGAN: Elon should make a phone. I bet he's thinking about it because he's in some sort of a dispute right now with Apple because Apple won't – there's something about the way Grok AI shows up and he's saying that their algorithm is essentially rigged. I have something about an app on my phone, but. JOE ROGAN: So maybe that'll incentivize him to make a phone. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Elon, make a phone and we'll try it out. JOE ROGAN: “Elon Musk says Apple is rigging the app store for ChatGPT. The tech mogul is threatening immediate legal action, accusing the iPhone maker of unequivocal antitrust violation designed to favor his AI rival.” ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, is his AI rival Sam Altman? I wonder if that – I mean, you don't just say something like that, do you? JOE ROGAN: Oh, readers added context “2025 Deep Seek reached number one.” And Deep Seek's the Chinese one, right? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, and Deep Seek's freaky about some of the stuff that it can do. JOE ROGAN: “Just one month ago, Perplexity also reached number one overall in India's App Store. Both of these occurred after the OpenAI Apple partnership announced on June 10, 2024.” But what about the United States? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's literally when you go to buy a phone, it's usually an iPhone. JOE ROGAN: I think it's something crazy with kids. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, don't get me – if you have a kid, keep them off phones as long as you can. But the point is, the App Store in America, that is the monopoly in this country if you want to get an app. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: To be honest with you, I've only ever had an iPhone and so that's the only platform I've ever used. I know, it's Android versus iPhone. Android's way better than it used to be. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But it's still freaky. JOE ROGAN: I had it back in the day, but it's right there where an iPhone is right now, just different. And gives you a lot more access to stuff. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, it's so freaky though. Then you have these phones that are considered actual safe phones that aren't ripping your data and basically turning on every 10 minutes to kind of be able to target you for sales, whatever it might be. I can tell you that given my job and some of this stuff, I am totally freaked out by having an iPhone. And I look forward to the day where I don't have to have a phone. I'm going to get a flip phone. JOE ROGAN: They're going to already have a chip in your head by then. JOE ROGAN: I don't know if there are any phones that really, truly are safe. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: That's because they're like, “We can't track you.” Because they're using this other operating system. But it's what Adam Curry uses. It's a de-Googled iPhone that uses an alternative operating system. So this doesn't send data. So there's multiple different OSes that people use outside of the Google, but you can only use it on Android phones and a lot of people use it on Pixel phones. The Asian gentleman who has that? He's always talking to you about how insecure all of your technology is and explaining why they added this and what this means now and where your data is going and how they can track you. JOE ROGAN: So he sells de-Googled iPhones. Oh, he's a response to Joe Rogan. “Joe Rogan is wondering what I'm hiding. Five years ago I was just saying what's – he's scared.” So this guy's been at this forever, right? So five years ago we were talking about him and he was making these phones five years ago. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, and from a government perspective, you have this aspect of – a lot of people don't want to reform FISA. FISA in the way that it can surveillance Americans is pretty freaky. And I actually did not get a committee assignment on House Armed Services as a vet because I voted against FISA and I was one of two that voted against it. And they said that I was not a team player. But when you actually look at. JOE ROGAN: Playing for the team seems to be an ongoing thing. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I am playing for the team, but it's just not the nutty team. JOE ROGAN: Isn't that a nutty thing to say? Whatever happened to representative of the people? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: There's still a few good representatives. I believe it's few to part between. JOE ROGAN: Well, I think it's hard. It's probably hard to keep your morals and your ethics when everyone around you isn't. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: You have to not. So some of the best representatives, best even people in government are the ones that did not have to do this job. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And that's because if you're giving up something to come here, it means that you're doing it for the right reasons. If you have nothing to gain from this position and this is the only thing you've ever wanted to be, you're usually not the best person for that job. And I say that because you are then only going to do what it takes to get reelected, which means that you are willing to compromise your principles because there will be decisions that you have to take where you're going to have to stand firm on your principles and be like, “I can't vote for that.” When a certain bill comes up, if I'm voting against it, you have planted stories in the press. You have super PACs that will come in and drop text messages in your district to your constituents saying, “Did you know that Representative so and so voted against this?” And so you have to be able to be like, “All right, I'm just going to just disconnect.” And at a certain point, you do have to do that, because then you'll go crazy. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, you can't read. Don't fight with the bots. Don't fight with the bots. JOE ROGAN: No, people do read them. It's just interesting that representatives today, some of them are kind of characters, where they become. He actually makes sense on stage. JOE ROGAN: Much more reasonable than most. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: He is in the Senate kind of right. JOE ROGAN: He's kind of right. And that is really how he likes to dress. When I saw him in DC, it was 10 degrees out. And he's just – but that's genuinely him. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, he's a big guy, too. JOE ROGAN: Probably sweats a lot. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Not saying that we know he sweats, but just, for sure he does. JOE ROGAN: He's a big guy. But the point is, he's kind of a character. There's characters and they're like main characters in this political show that we're all watching on television. So I actually was on oversight with all these people, except for Fetterman. And what I'll tell you is the oversight tends to bring out the characters, for sure. And what I will say is that actually I have been able to on certain things. Like with AOC, I introduced a piece of legislation. So there was a partner bill in the Senate with Bernie Sanders and I think Josh Holland to cap credit card interest at 10%. I started getting a lot of heat for it because people were like, “you can't do that.” And I was like, “well, most of these banks that we're talking about are actually taking government bailouts. And what ends up happening is some of these people will take out credit or max out their credit cards in them for the rest of their life. And then also there's something that we've been able to introduce. And there's another bill that I'm introducing with another Democrat and another Republican that's a more moderate Republican, but it's actually to cap student loan interest at 2.5%. JOE ROGAN: That would be wonderful, because I was just going to ask you about that. I was reading this woman on X and she was talking about how she graduated with student loans that equaled, I think it was $28,000. So what they do is they actually, and I've been quoted on this, but it creates an indentured servant. Basically, for the rest of their life, they're paying off this debt. And you can never actually function in a pocket. And then they actually can't get a good start at being contributing members of society. If you want to make America great again, have less people in debt, have less losers. Have more people that can get things going on because they're not burdened by some crazy debt. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And to be clear, I'm not talking about student loan forgiveness. But I had to join the military, I paid for my college using the GI Bill and so do I think student loans forgiveness is fair? But is this a way that we can actually make a happy medium to where people are actually given the opportunity to pay back the debt? JOE ROGAN: I think in an ideal world education is free. In an ideal country where you really care about the people and you really want more success stories, education is free, difficult to get into, you have to be qualified, a true meritocracy. And if these certain people from different parts of the country don't seem to be getting in address that, figure out what's wrong with their school system and throw federal funds at that, it's not impossible to figure out why certain school systems are doing poorly and other ones are doing great. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I will tell you from a personal lens and perspective. So there was that lot of stuff. But I ended up actually going to Venice High School one of these times. And that was around my junior year. And what the LA Unified School District was doing at the time, they were actually busing in kids from other parts of LA County. And so what was happening outside in the neighborhoods was carrying on into the school districts. And when you have gang activity and kids, the only opportunity that they have is being able to join a gang and that's it. And so that carries on into the education system. And so I think in Florida, we've been doing it right with school choice. President Trump's been pretty big on that. But being able to give students or their parents the ability to send them to good schools without gang activity outside of their zip code, that matters, and that does impact people. JOE ROGAN: And cracking down on gang activity. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So there was a kid that was shot in the parking lot of my school. JOE ROGAN: No, listen, you don't have to tell me. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Back before it was gentrified. And it's kind of getting crazy now with homeless people. So when I was 19, I joined the military, and then my mom ended up leaving California with my little brother and sister probably about five years ago now. JOE ROGAN: Venice is always such an interesting part of LA because it's like LA, but really weird. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: LA is weird, though, as a whole. But Venice has a surf culture, Dog Town. Venice in the 90s was really cool. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, in the early 2000s, it was cool too, but it was rough. JOE ROGAN: What's always been filled with crime? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, I got jumped. Yeah, I got jumped in high school. I swear, part of the reason why I'm such a huge advocate for standing up to bullies is probably because of that. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Venice was rough back in the day. JOE ROGAN: I had a buddy of mine who lived there in the park where he used to take his kid. JOE ROGAN: And he's like, “okay, great. Where do I take my kid now? You can always fight your way out of it. And I met a lot of other people in the military who grew up in inner city Chicago or wherever it was. They were able to go back and help their family and to my mom's credit, my mom also has an incredible story, but she had me at 20 years old, single mom. My dad ended up eventually getting clean, but my husband and I moved him in with us and then he got sober. And so that story in itself, I think, you tell your story and it empowers other people, especially to be fighters and not just give up. JOE ROGAN: A lot of people have bad childhoods. And people aren't going to tell you that. No one's going to be like, you know, but. JOE ROGAN: But it's also great for someone to hear a story like yours or someone who came out of a similar childhood, maybe that they're having or maybe even worse than they're having. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, and it is. And it's powerful, I think, to an idea that would box certain people, whether you're a woman or you're Hispanic, into this stereotype on how you should believe and think and. JOE ROGAN: Vote or you're poor. You come from a single mom. I think that was one of the most important things about Obama becoming president. We heard, “oh, guys comes from a single mom and he became the president of the United States.” It was like, for a lot of people, it's like, “okay, relatable.” Yeah, well, maybe my life isn't what I wished it would be, but look what that guy's able to accomplish. Maybe I can do something too, instead of thinking I'm going to be a loser forever. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Well, what was interesting is I shared my story. So remember I told you I started out as an activist and I would tell people this because I do feel like too, at a certain sense when you tell your story, you can share that you're empowering other people to take something and turn it into a positive. And within maybe a couple weeks of me getting elected, I all of a sudden started having this Washington Post reporter reaching out to my family and actually asked my mom whether she had proof that my grandmother had actually passed away HIV positive. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And was harassing her. JOE ROGAN: Trying to catch you. And so they put out this nasty, nasty article about me, basically trying to say that I had fabricated my dad's incarceration record. They had tried to say that I was a registered Democrat in Washington. All this stuff that was categorically false. And I had actually gotten contacted from my old target. And so after this came out. And then Time magazine had actually reached out and they said, “would you mind if we conduct an interview on your background?” I said, “have at it. This is like Speedy Gonzalez with a sombrero running around. It's like, what am I supposed to be? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It was so crazy. JOE ROGAN: That is such a crazy thing to say. How black are you exactly, Mr. Obama? You don't look that black to me. But I actually gave all this information to Time magazine. JOE ROGAN: Can you imagine saying that to Obama? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: When people would ask me actually mention that to a reporter, actually, because of the fact that he's half white and half black. JOE ROGAN: Oh, boy, that's so ridiculous. That's such a ridiculous thing to ask. It's like, it goes in the face of what's supposed to be about their principles. Their principles are supposed to be not seeing color at all. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Oh, there's a lot. JOE ROGAN: They're going to attack you and say you're pretending to be Hispanic or that you're barely Hispanic and not Hispanic enough. And then I had to explain, though, to a reporter, I said, “Well, if my mom's half and my dad's half, what does that make me?” And she goes, “A quarter.” I said, “No, that's not.” Imagine someone saying, “I'm not Italian.” That's hilarious. That's such a crazy thing that they allow it as long as it's coming from their side. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: And also, too, if I were on the other side, I'd probably be like a rock star. After doing like 20 something hours on background, I gave them all the evidence and they actually ended up writing an article on me called “The Influencer that came to Congress” and then named me as Time magazine's next 100 most influential in the World. JOE ROGAN: Well, that's nice of them. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I'm just glad that it vindicated me because it was not a fun spot to be in. I know that it's always going to be a part of politics, but it's so disruptive, disappointing as an enlightened culture that we don't disavow that kind of reporting and recognize from both sides how detrimental it is to finding out what's real and what's true. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It was done though, because of the fact that people like me specifically don't meet a certain stereotype. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: But it's like, for people, wondering why? JOE ROGAN: People are going to know why they did it. Progressives will allow like the most devious behaviors from their side. Republicans do the same thing, the most devious shit, as long as it's beneficial to their side. You could disagree with someone, don't think they're the right person for the job, vote against them. That's all great, but when you start deceiving people with false depictions of who a person is and making up a bunch of stupid shit and calling into question how Hispanic they are, it's so ridiculous. It's like, this shouldn't be where we're at in 2025. It shouldn't be where we're at as a mature nation. I've been through the ringer politics. So I'm kind of battle hardened for it. And I was like, my mom is really cool. And so for her to be treated like that, I was like, it's like one thing in politics, you leave a family out of it. And again, it's one of those things that we shouldn't tolerate, we shouldn't be doing it, we shouldn't advocate for it, we shouldn't be happy if it's done against the side that's ideologically opposed to other. There's other ways to do it. You don't have to just be a twat all the time. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I prefer debating on ideology tends to be the best. It's like in fighting, you can't just go and sucker punch someone. It's kind of like the same thing. They tried to sucker punch me and I was like, it's also Jackie Chan. JOE ROGAN: You don't have to be fighting. And they don't want to hear a rational opposing viewpoint because they're so married to their stupid ideas. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's a lot interesting how Congress functions when the cameras are off. And I think people would definitely change their opinion because a lot of people will do it for clicks. Ratings and social media has not helped with that because people are looking for what can go viral next. There's like this viral theory that people, they think that they can only be successful in their policy or their argument, whether it's committee hearings or whatever, they want that clip that they can post and then get notoriety for. So social media has been both a blessing and a curse in this social media sphere or in the political sphere, because you can get your information out directly to the American people using it and refute bad information. But then there's also this aspect of like, I wish people could see the conversations that take place behind the scenes because it wouldn't be so inflammatory, basically, is what I'm saying. Well, full transparency will come with the chip. Anna, just put the chip in your brain. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: No chips, don't put it. JOE ROGAN: Everybody will have full transparency. It seems like this whole thing, your whole journey, becoming involved in politics has been pretty stressful. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's definitely not something I want my son to do. What did you think it was going to be like before you got in and what was different once you got in there? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: So when I first started out in politics, I started out as. So I joined the military at 19. I wanted to be a doctor. So I got into a med school program at SGU in Grenada and I was supposed to go to that. And then, I kid you not, like the day before I was supposed to leave, I got recruited to work for a nonprofit to basically help lead out Hispanic activism nationally. And then I realized that as part of that job they were putting me on television. I had a booker and so I was talking about stuff happening, but it was more the commentary on inflammatory things. I actually wanted to address what was happening with human trafficking and I actually requested the State Department's report. I was a big activist with it. I was working with a non profit at the time and I realized that they only wanted me to talk about what was getting them the ratings. And so I did realize I was like, “Well they keep though talking about what people in D.C. are doing. So I called my husband, I was like, “We're going to run for office.” He goes, “What do you mean we?” ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, what do you mean? I was like, “Well, from what I gather, everyone's like a team effort” and it's totally true. And so he ended up basically figuring it out with me. And for someone like me, there's no how to manual how to run from office. But it would be a lot more helpful if there were 10 other of me. And so when I'm done in office, I'm going to help recruit younger candidates that have the ideological perspective I do to run them and then I'm going to help do things for them behind the scenes to help get them in. JOE ROGAN: You're going to be a mastermind behind the scenes. JOE ROGAN: It just seems like a super broken process. I've seen a lot of other parliaments. I'm a member of the House Democracy Partnership Institute. I've gone to a lot of countries. And we still have the best system. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Yeah, but we need that. JOE ROGAN: But I still believe it's a mess. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It's a mess, though, because good people don't want to run. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: Young people have to run. JOE ROGAN: It's also a mess because the people that have been in positions of power for so long are so set in their ways and are so deeply ingrained in the system. I don't know if it's possible to unwind all that stuff. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: It is if you have enough fresh blood. So how do you shock a system? So going back to kind of the declassification efforts that we've been working on. For the first time in U.S. history, you have an aspect of the government that's being transparent and releasing information. And you cannot be a pessimist in this job or else you will go crazy. So you have to be an optimist and understand that there is a solution for it. And going back to kind of those quantum breadcrumbs. But I also think that part of what I'm supposed to do is to help other people do this. So I'm going to help kind of execute that mission. JOE ROGAN: How much longer are you going to be in office? ANNA PAULINA LUNA: I don't know, but not definitely in the next 10 years, I promise you. JOE ROGAN: Well, if I'm still doing a podcast. Hopefully then we'll know UFOs are real. ANNA PAULINA LUNA: At least we get some declassified stuff, right? Remember back when we didn't know who killed JFK? JOE ROGAN: Well, thank you very much for being here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Air Force F-22s were dispatched in coordination with Canadian fighters. The F-22 Raptor was crafted to dominate air combat through stealth and advanced systems. Let's explores how the jet's unique capabilities have made it a key asset in confronting mysteries above, a tale of precision patrols, radar enigmas, and national security responses. In early 2023, a Chinese surveillance balloon drifted over the United States, reaching heights of 60,000 feet. It was ultimately shot down by an F-22 using a missile strike, believed to be the highest altitude air intercept in history. Just days after the balloon incident, NORAD detected another unidentified high-altitude object over Yukon, Canada. US Air Force F-22s were dispatched in coordination with Canadian fighters. These events came amid heightened airspace scrutiny spawned by prior balloon sightings. Enhanced radar resolution and rapid response protocols meant that even slow, small objects, previously dismissed, were now tracked closely, prompting F-22 intercepts as precautionary measures. Historical precedents show the military's long-standing role in intercepting unidentified craft. These deployments underscore a broader truth, that even modern stealth fighters are central to investigating the unknown. The F-22's stealth, speed, and advanced sensors enable it to intercept anomalies with minimal notice. The F-22 Raptor never set out to chase UFOs, yet it now shadows them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wednesday was a smash hit upon its debut on November 23, 2022. Its first season centered on the titular Addams Family member enrolling at Nevermore Academy and becoming embroiled in a dark mystery involving several grisly murders on the school grounds. Wednesday's first run secured an impressive 73% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and obtained an 85% approval rating from audiences on the same site's Popcornmeter. This made it rather unsurprising when Wednesday was renewed for a second season. This time, the mystery concerns an enigmatic stalker who has been following Wednesday since she became famous for taking down Hyde, and Wednesday's visions of Enid's demise. Alongside returning favorites, Wednesday Season 2 introduces a new roster of characters played by some of the world's biggest film and television actors. It is easily one of the most star-studded casts of any Netflix drama series, and the actors' rapport together is apparent. Wednesday's friends and family, in particular, have incredible chemistry. Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia Addams bounces off Wednesday and the Nevermore students nicely, delivering some brilliantly dry sarcasm, like how she claims she makes Gomez believe he is "in charge of this family." Morticia's dynamic with Luis Guzman's Gomez Addams is extremely convincing, capturing the feel of a husband and wife team who have been together for many years. Pugsley begins his studies at Nevermore, portrayed excellently by Isaac Ordonez. His wide-eyed enthusiasm for horrific creatures, such as his pet zombie Slurp, brings some great moments of levity to the series, making his socially awkward roommate, Eugene Ottinger, apprehensive about this new addition to the school. The biggest standout of Wednesday is Emma Myers' Enid Sinclair. Jenny Ortega fondly described her co-star as a "badass" during Wednesday's second season, and discussed how Emma Myers makes her "job so much easier," indicating that their off-screen camaraderie is as powerful as it is onscreen. Wednesday and Enid's fierce loyalty towards one another has left fans convinced they will eventually become a couple, believing there may be some romantic subtext behind their pairing. This has been fueled further by Enid's declaration that she cannot "imagine" her life without Wednesday in it. Wednesday Season 2 has some major names among its cast. Among the most iconic is Joanna Lumley, who features as Grandmama Addams. Joanna Lumley brings a fresh new dynamic to the Addams Family, with Grandmama's sharp tongue and manipulative personality causing tension between her and Morticia. Wednesday and Grandmama's relationship as granddaughter and grandmother is also enjoyable to watch, as Grandmama is the one person in their family who Wednesday feels the closest to. Another excellent inclusion to the Wednesday cast is Billie Piper. Billie Piper is exceptional in the part, bringing her own love for music to her take on Nevermore's newest staff member, and imbuing the character with a brilliant writ. The character makes great use of Billie Piper's past as a pop singer, bursting into occasional song numbers during Wednesday Season 2. As a werewolf, she also holds a special bond with Enid, giving Enid someone to confide in outside of Wednesday. Isadora brings out the best in Nevermore's quirky characters, like Wednesday and Enid, allowing them to shine brighter than in Wednesday's first season. Watching Wednesday Season 2, it feels as though Billie Piper has always been a part of the TV Series, even though the show's second run marks her first appearance. The Netflix series would be wise to keep Billie Piper for a potential third season. Christopher Lloyd is the biggest name attached to Wednesday. He is Nevermore's longest-serving teacher, delivering lessons in biology. His intense dislike of troublemakers results in him developing an entertaining rivalry with Pugsley. Professor Orlov disapproves of Pugsley's mischievous behavior, and his strong principles make him a superb antagonist for Pugsley during his stay at the Nevermore Academy. He previously depicted Uncle Fester in the 1990s Addams Family movies. Wednesday's second season shows the introduction of a new principal to Nevermore Academy. Reservoir Dogs actor Steve Buscemi takes on Nevermore's new school head, Barry Dort. He is fantastically over-the-top as the villainous school principal. He maintains a happy-go-lucky demeanor while threatening his students, appearing unfazed by Wednesday burning down the portrait of herself and her friends in Season 2's opener, while informing Bianca that he will remove her scholarship if she does not comply with securing the school's extra funding. His distrust of "normies" without supernatural abilities adds an interesting cynical angle to his character, believing that Nevermore's outcasts can never properly integrate with those without these gifts, and that Nevermore must be separated from these people to keep the students safe. Barry believes he is acting in Nevermore's best interests but, in reality, his actions serve only to alienate the school's residents from the rest of society. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Haunted Heart by Christina Aguilera, an original song for The Addams Family animated film, has released a lyric music video, with Morticia Addams. Guy Ritchie fans will soon be able to watch his criminally underrated detective movies on Netflix. Gundam Wing has an overlooked novel sequel that came out years ago, but its laughably bad story direction made this follow-up not worthy of an anime.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon. As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved. Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959. These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural". This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years. It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago. Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media". Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon. This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart. Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation. Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail. When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls. They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path. What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli. Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons. Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis. However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction. An ominous interstellar object named 3I/Atlas is hurtling towards our solar system at astonishing speeds. What does this mean for Earth, and could it be a sign of extraterrestrial …</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During the short ritual, IRB president Billy McGuire holds up a golden harp before turning it around seven times. Over the years the turning of the seal ceremony has been tolerated by city authorities as, at worst, a harmless nonsense by a group with a tenuous grasp of Irish history. In recent years, however, a new cohort has taken over the IRB, turning it into an organisation steeped in the pseudo-legal language of the sovereign citizen movement, which believes, in basic terms, that citizens are not subject to State laws. This has caused officials in Dublin and nationally to become increasingly nervous about the group's intentions. [ ‘Serious concerns' over conspiracy theory group forming shadow system of county councils ] A spokesman for the Department of Defence declined to comment except to say that since last year it is an offence to use the term Óglaigh na hÉireann “other than where such use is authorised by law”. In spite of its military aspirations, the IRB does not claim to be an armed group. It played a key behind-the-scenes role in the struggle for independence before, according to all credible histories, officially disbanding in 1924, two years after it split over the Anglo-Irish Treaty. This version of events has left some historians scratching their heads. “If there was a Tom McGuire around in 1919, he was nobody important,” says historian Owen McGee, author of The IRB: the Irish Republican Brotherhood, from the Land League to Sinn Féin. Flanagan claims to have been before the courts more than any person in Ireland, often representing himself and employing sovereign citizen legal strategies. Flanagan's many civil hearings include a case taken in 2017 by his company Diamrem Ltd against Clare County Council. Diamrem is seeking €15 million in damages from the council for opening a car park at the Cliffs of Moher, which it claims scuppered its nearby private car park. With McGuire's blessing, Flanagan took over as chairman of the IRB's supreme council in February 2022. Other figures who had been prominent in opposing the government's Covid-19 measures followed. Former UCD professor Dolores Cahill, who claimed children who wore face masks would have lower IQ, was appointed as “chief justice” (she was later ousted from the role and replaced by a builder from Mayo). HSE physiotherapist Anna Marie Stack Rivas, who was subject to a fitness-to-practise inquiry after speaking out against Covid-19 vaccines, became secretary for public health. Barra de Róiste, a primary schoolteacher who refused to enforce mask rules in class, was appointed education secretary. Howard Hughes, a “life and executive coach” was put in charge of foreign affairs, making him responsible for forging links with sovereign citizen movements around the world, including in the UK, New Zealand and Hawaii. The supreme council declared it was taking over authority of the government in 2022 but it was last year that its “paper war” began in earnest. Confused civil servants and court officials began receiving a deluge of documents adorned with the ornate wax seals of the IRB. Also repealed, according to the IRB, was Laudabiliter, a papal bull said to have been issued by Pope Adrian IV in 1155 permitting the Norman invasion of Ireland. The group also went about setting up a network of “co-ops” and councils around the country, which would become their version of local government. The IRB claims it has established more than 30 bodies in seven counties, with particularly strong representation in Donegal and Galway. Documents were then issued to the genuine local councils, informing them that all decisions must first be referred to their IRB counterparts. Co-op members also started recruiting in their local areas. Flanagan told one meeting that 150 people had been recruited to the Crossmolina co-op in Co Mayo. Another member claimed to have recruited 297 people by canvassing just two housing estates in Finglas. Efforts began to set up a network of community and county courts around the country, with locals being asked to take up the role of judges. The extent of this network is not clear, although Flanagan claims one case was held before a jury in Kilfenora, Co Clare, in 2022 which resulted in the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 being struck down. In response to queries, the Department of Justice warned that any summons issued by these IRB courts “are invalid and without lawful authority”. Several local authorities responded to queries that they have never heard of the IRB. However, in Galway, two meetings of the Oughterard co-op were attended by Independent Ireland councillor Noel Thomas, according to minutes of the meetings. Thomas was a Fianna Fáil councillor until 2024 when he resigned after facing disciplinary action for saying the “inn is full” in reference to immigration. Other councillors in Galway began expressing concern these groups may be misleading locals into believing they are legitimate public representatives. According to a report in July in the Connacht Tribune, Independent councillor Thomas Welby said the IRB was “peddling mistruths” and that “there were young people going around Oughterard wrongly claiming people don't have to pay their car tax or insurance”. A spokeswoman for Galway County Council said it was aware of these councils and that at a meeting in June, “elected members expressed concern regarding the potential confusion these groups may cause to the public by presenting themselves as representative bodies. “We have very serious concerns about any group which seeks to position itself as a substitute for local government or the courts system without any democratic mandate, legal standing or accountability,” says Hourigan, a Fine Gael councillor in Tipperary. She urged the public to be cautious about engaging with groups that claim to be representative bodies “without any basis in law or legitimacy through the democratic process.” The IRB has also been active in setting up its own versions of more mundane State functions. In August 2023 Flanagan produced one of these cards when he was pulled over by gardaí while driving his 2022 BMW X5 at 155km per hour on the motorway. He employed various sovereign-citizen legal devices, telling the court he was not a person under the law but a “sovereign living man, ever present from fertilisation until last breath”. The judge found against Flanagan, accusing him of employing a “a pseudo-legal nonsense without any effect and done for reasons which are at best confused and at worst malign”. Recently, much of the IRB's efforts have gone into setting up its own property registration service. He said profits “go towards further employment and the advancement of these services”. The group has faced criticism for its approach towards finances. Last year, during an appearance on an Irish far-right podcast, Flanagan faced questions over why the IRB was charging €22 a head for “deeds of acknowledgment and confirmation”. Flanagan said the charge was to “cover costs”. Instead they were there ‘to assist public representatives' Flanagan agreed to an interview but said he was unavailable this week. Instead he responded to a list of questions from The Irish Times. That authority had been transferred to Dáil Éireann in 1919 but reverted back to the IRB following a decision of its “supreme council” in 2022, he said. The decisions of these courts would be referred to An Garda Síochána for enforcement, he said. Instead they were there “to assist public representatives”, he said. He said there were 2,000-3,000 people involved in the IRB's local councils. He said more than 1,000 had signed up for the property registration service and more than 1,500 had sought IRB deeds of citizenship. Rather, it was referring to the version of Óglaigh na hÉireann established in 1913. Regarding fees, Flanagan said TMHL did not receive any income from the IRB and that earlier this month a decision was taken to replace the €500 property registration fee with an optional donation to “a community of their choice”. With its ill-defined ideology and bizarre legal theories, that position seems unlikely to change significantly in the near future. So, given that its main political achievement to date is annoying civil servants, why should anyone be concerned? According to Dr Kevin Sweeney, a criminologist in UCC who studies the effects of disinformation on democratic institutions, the danger is that groups like the IRB can slowly erode trust in State institutions. Once that agreement is withdrawn, things fall apart. Sovereign citizen movements offer easy answers to complex questions, he says, and it is often vulnerable people who suffer. Such groups first became popular in the United States where they evolved from pro-gun and anti-tax militia movements, he says. Their basic tenets include that citizens do not have to pay taxes or appear in court unless they have entered a “contract” to do so and that government authority “is defective or limited,” states Sweeney. Adherents often employ these “pseudo-laws” to claim they do not have to repay debts or obey road traffic laws. These types of arguments have been repeatedly and emphatically rejected in the Irish courts, yet people continue to rely on them, sometimes resulting in large legal bills or even jail terms for contempt. “When these false beliefs hit reality, it's never a pretty sight,” says Sweeney. Flanagan says violence is “repugnant” to the group's objectives. However, in other countries sovereign citizen movements have been responsible for attacks on government institutions and the murder of police officers. Last year, nine members of the Reichsbürger movement, a German sovereign citizen group, went on trial accused of attempting to orchestrate a coup against the Berlin government. “Only a tiny per cent of those with radical views become extremists and take radical action,” Sweeney says, “But as the core group grows ... the likelihood of violence becomes greater. “Once you accept the conspiracy theory worldview is correct, you're a very short distance away from taking active measures,” he says.</p>
