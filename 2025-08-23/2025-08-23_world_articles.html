Please make this work possible with a quick donation. This story was originally published by Labor Notes. Local newspapers have consolidated into ever larger chains controlled by private equity and vulture funds. Into this changing news landscape has come an influx of new journalists who bridle at the poor working conditions and low pay inflicted by media moguls building their empires on the cheap. Thousands of these media workers are finding a home in the NewsGuild. The Guild has transformed itself in recent years, thanks to rising rank-and-file militancy and innovative organizing tactics. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Since 2020, the Guild has grown faster than any other CWA sector or district, organizing more than 8,500 workers. The Guild also has 6,000 members in Canada. Since January 2024 alone, the Guild has negotiated 62 first-time contracts. The Guild also represents an increasing number of staff workers at non-profits and unions. The union is enlisting rank-and-file members who have successfully organized their own union to help workers at other sites get organized. Some of these workers are volunteers, while others are paid by the Guild for a few hours a week. With member-to-member organizing, says Jon Schleuss, the Guild's international president, workers looking to unionize “get to learn from another rank-and-file worker who just won an election themselves, and that's a powerful experience. Schleuss joined the Guild as a digital news journalist at the Los Angeles Times, after helping lead a successful drive to unionize the newsroom in 2015. He was elected president of the NewsGuild in 2019 at just 32 years old. The member-organizer strategy has flourished under his watch. “We have this philosophy of ‘learn, do, teach' to train other members to take on the tasks and share the work,” Basile says. “Organizing can be hard — it can be exhausting,” says Megan Gray, arts and culture reporter at the Portland Press Herald and president of The News Guild of Maine. The Maine member-organizers' monthly meetings are “sort of group therapy for organizers,” she says. By sharing experiences, organizers come up with new ways to solve problems and hear practical advice on building solidarity. The union's member-driven organizing has also fostered a rank-and-file approach to bargaining. Danielle Newsome, NewsGuild's director of collective bargaining, said that leadership decided that the union needed to train more members to support bargaining in both their own shops and other shops. The Guild's grassroots militancy has been fueled in part by large Guild attendance at Labor Notes conferences, held every two years in Chicago. It hopes to send even more next year. One strategy the union picked up from Labor Notes and other unions, he says, is open bargaining, where the union insists that members be allowed to sit in on bargaining sessions with the company. When members see bosses taking hardline, inflexible stances, militancy grows. Hundreds of workers walked the picket lines at the New York Times last fall during an eight-day strike by tech workers. The company had a history of firing workers without explanation, a practice that would be barred under the clause. A month after the strike, the union announced it had reached an agreement that included just-cause protections. The Guild's organizing strategy has caught the attention of Eric Blanc, professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. His new book, We Are the Union: How Worker-to-Worker Organizing Is Revitalizing Labor and Winning Big, highlights the Guild's model. “By giving more responsibility to workers for systematic training, the Guild is developing a program that can scale up,” said Blanc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ghislaine Maxwell has denied introducing Prince Andrew to Jeffrey Epstein and said they met for the first time at the holiday home of a British-American philanthropist. Maxwell's claim emerged in transcripts of her Department of Justice interviews, which were released on Friday afternoon by the Trump administration. “First of all, let's just state, I did not introduce him [Epstein] to Prince Andrew. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for recruiting underage girls for Epstein, claimed one of his clients, Lynn Forester de Rothschild, introduced the men in Martha's Vineyard in the early 2000s. Lady de Rothschild, a New Jersey-born telecoms businesswoman turned investor, chairs EL Rothschild, a wealth management firm which has The Economist Group in its portfolio. A donor to both Bill and Hillary Clinton's political campaigns, Lady de Rothschild founded the not for profit Council for Inclusive Capitalism. I think it was in the Vineyard or Nantucket, I can't remember now which one it was,” Maxwell told Todd Blanche, deputy attorney-general and a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump. It was either in Nantucket or the Vineyard, and invited Epstein to go, and I believe that's when he met Prince Andrew.” Organisations associated with Lady de Rothschild, 71, have been approached for comment. Her spokesman has previously firmly denied claims that Epstein gave her financial help after a divorce from politician Andrew Stein. “One hundred percent false,” the spokesman told Vanity Fair in 2019. Lady de Rothschild's third marriage was to British financier and philanthropist Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, a scion of the famous banking family, who died in 2022, aged 91. The transcripts were released by the Trump administration in a push to dampen criticism over a failure to release evidence about Epstein. Maxwell, a former socialite, said she never would have thought to introduce Prince Andrew and Epstein because they were like “two chalk and cheeses”. She also claimed that Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrew's now ex-wife, tried to “put the moves” on Epstein. And they met and hung out, I want to say two or three times that had nothing to do with me,” she said. I couldn't even imagine Epstein and Andrew together.”</p>

Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. As universities in Gaza resume online teaching after months of suspension due to the ongoing genocide, 25-year-old Mohaned Asayas, a student in the art department at Al-Aqsa University, said he struggled with the practical aspects of his art courses. “This is not only my problem but also that of all my classmates,” he said, “as the war has destroyed most of our studios, made art supplies unaffordable and scarce, and deprived us of a motivational and inspiring space for drawing.” Asayas thought deeply about a solution to this problem and, with sufficient support from the Palestinian Ministry of Culture, brought his idea to life by launching a workshop he named Aphenix. The initiative offered artists in Gaza a much-needed space to breathe, away from the burdens of war, and provided them with artistic tools to create new works. Asayas said that through the workshop, 25 artists had the chance to come together for three hours a day in a coffee shop in the heart of Gaza City, creating their own world, laughing, sharing knowledge, and drawing with different materials such as soft charcoal, pastel, and acrylic. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. The workshop lasted a month, culminating in an exhibition titled Aphenix,  named after the workshop itself, which was held in July 2025. Each artist produced works that conveyed not only personal stories but also the collective experiences of their people — tales marked by starvation, displacement, relentless bombardment, and profound loss. “Depression had sapped my energy and focus, and the loss of my studio made creating art even more difficult,” she said. “It helped lift me out of the difficult mental state I had been struggling with, as I began using art as a way to release the negative energy and intense pressure caused by the war,” she said. Al Amasy worked on two paintings for the exhibition. In each, she said she relied on soft charcoal for drawing, in addition to her own style characterized by random lines and sudden strokes as a way of expressing the inner confusion and psychological turmoil she carries inside. In her second painting, Al Amasy sought to shed light on the famine gripping Gaza. Inas Rayan, 22, a visual artist, also said her participation in the Aphenix project increased her confidence and helped her return to the creative world where she belongs after she had struggled with feeling lost and unsure of herself, especially following her father's killing and the destruction of her home during the Israeli ground invasion of Jabalia refugee camp. Rayan said that before the war began, she loved to draw with bright colors, creating paintings full of life and optimism. However, after the war, she noticed that her artistic vision had changed significantly. She now has begun to draw with darker colors, depicting scenes of destruction and loss in an attempt to convey the suffering and pain of her people. At an age when they should be playing, learning, and dreaming of a bright future, these children are instead compelled to care for their families while coping with profound loss. Fadal Tafish, 30, an art teacher specializing in acrylic painting, said the Aphenix workshop lifted him from the ashes, allowing him to reclaim even a small part of his life as an artist before the war began. “I was happy to be able to pursue my work as an artist, helping others develop their artistic skills despite all the challenges,” he said. Despite the immense challenges Asayas and his fellow artists faced in bringing this exhibition to life — hunger, working with only basic tools, transportation difficulties, limited communication due to internet outages, and relentless bombardment — they succeeded in creating something extraordinary, sending a powerful message to the world: We are here, and Gaza is still home to brilliant young talents with bold ideas and unyielding will in the face of devastation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday. According to official documents posted online, the DHS told Ábrego's attorneys on Friday afternoon that the “DHS may remove your client … to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends)”. Ábrego entered the US without permission in about 2011 as a teenager after fleeing gang violence. He was subsequently afforded a federal protection order against deportation to El Salvador. The 30-year-old was initially deported by federal immigration officials in March. Though the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego's deportation was an “administrative error”, officials have repeatedly accused him of being affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim Ábrego and his family vehemently deny. During his detention at El Salvador's so-called Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), Ábrego was physically and psychologically tortured, according to court documents filed by his lawyers in July. In June, the Trump administration returned Ábrego from El Salvador, only to charge him with crimes related to human smuggling, which his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”. His criminal trial is expected to begin in January. Before his deportation, Ábrego had lived in Maryland for more than a decade, working in construction while being married to an American wife. Although Ábrego was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. Separately, in a statement earlier this week, Uganda said that it agreed to a “temporary agreement” with the US to accept some asylum seekers who are deported from the country. Bagiire Vincent Waiswa, permanent secretary of Uganda's foreign ministry, said: “The agreement is in respect of third country nationals who may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From Boston to Los Angeles, President Donald Trump's portrayal of the District of Columbia as a lawless wasteland to justify his military and law enforcement incursion is viewed as an opening salvo in a bid to undermine the autonomy of America's biggest cities. On Friday, Trump promised to target Chicago next, then New York. Many big city mayors, however, remain defiant, saying: Not so fast, Mr. President. “Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures,” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat, said Tuesday, after Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to prosecute local officials whose cities did not comply with the White House's immigration crackdown. The federal government could slash funding to cities that don't comply and send in law enforcement as it has done in Los Angeles and DC, Bondi has said. Trump says Chicago next up for federal crime crackdown “Your attacks all come back to a common aim: The Trump Administration seeks to divide, isolate, and intimidate our cities, and make Americans fearful of one another,”  Wu said. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser called the president's actions an “authoritarian push.” The Home Rule Act of 1973 allows the president to take control of DC's police for 48 hours if he “determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist,” which requires the department's use for federal purposes. Any request of control over the city's police department for more than 30 days must be passed into law. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is,” Trump said during the announcement. He brought pizza and hamburgers to law enforcement officers who greeted him. Speaking from the Oval Office on Friday, Trump vowed to “straighten” out Chicago next and “then we'll help New York.” And seeming to conflate his deployment of troops in DC with his takeover of the city's police force, Trump on Friday said he can keep the National Guard in the nation's capital “as long as I want” if he declares a national emergency. In Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson in a statement Friday said the city had received no formal communication from the White House concerning any deployments there. Johnson expressed “grave concerns” over an “unlawful deployment,” calling Trump's approach “uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound.” Johnson had earlier said the city “remains in regular communication” with fellow Democratic Gov. Johnson and other US mayors have called on the Trump administration to restore more than $800 million in violence and crime prevention grants the DOJ has withheld to force states into cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. “These anti-violence programs have a direct impact on our work to reduce crime and violence in Chicago. Sending in the National Guard could destabilize our public safety efforts and would be counterproductive to rebuilding trust between residents and law enforcement,” Johnson's office said in a statement. Chicago police said Friday homicides are down 31% this year and shootings 36%. Johnson accused Trump of “stoking fear and division while criminalizing poverty.” “As Donald Trump attempts to create chaos that distracts from his problems, we will call it out for what it is,” Pritzker said. In Los Angeles, Trump defied Mayor Karen Bass by deploying National Guard troops and Marines to the city in June to protect federal buildings during protests against the administration's immigration policies. In a democratic society, she said, law enforcement problems should never need military solutions. I think DC is a test case as well,” Bass told CNN, warning that Trump's incursion into the capital could be a precursor for other illegal power grabs. “I'm going to look at New York in a little while,” Trump said the day he took federal control of DC's police force and mobilized National Guard troops. The warning comes as New York City is on track this year to record the lowest number of shootings and murders in its recorded history. “We don't need anyone to come in and take over our law enforcement apparatus. Still, authorities are preparing for the possibility of a federal takeover – ensuring civil disturbances are quickly and effectively handled to show there is no need for added enforcement, a state official told CNN this week. DC residents feel less safe after Trump takeover: poll About 1,000 guard members are already deployed on missions in New York state, including added security at transit hubs, according to the official. Discussions among state officials began after ICE demonstrations became heated in Los Angeles, the official said. He said it's “notable” that the cities Trump mentioned all have Black mayors and historic drops in violent crime. “Our federal law enforcement partners have real jobs to do — in partnership with state and local leaders — to investigate and prevent crime,” the statement added. He's slashing funding for organizations that are working to prevent crime in communities nationwide — yet he's claiming the Black mayors of DC, Baltimore, Chicago, and Oakland are the problem. “This is not leadership — it's an attempt to score cheap political points by tearing down communities he doesn't understand,” she said in a statement, CNN affiliate KRON-TV reported. In Philadelphia, another largely Democratic city whose violent crime has decreased substantially since post-pandemic peaks, District Attorney Larry Krasner held his own press conference in a West Philadelphia church one day after Trump's announcement. “The only emergency I can think of for public safety is what we call D.J.T.,” the progressive prosecutor said, flanked by spiritual leaders. National Guard troops from GOP-led states begin arriving in DC as part of Trump's crime crackdown “The timing doesn't make any sense in this respect,” said the Democratic representative when asked if he's worried about Trump's warning. Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker's office declined to comment to CNN on the ongoing federal takeover in DC or any hypothetical actions in Philly. Crowd in DC outraged by federal law enforcement presence as cars stopped on busy street In response to Trump's actions in DC, Democratic state Sen. Art Haywood, who represents part of Philadelphia, released a memo announcing the “Protecting PA Police Act.” Haywood's office explained the intent of the legislation would be to explicitly prevent any federal takeover of “1,000 municipal police departments (or) our state police.” Further details or a draft of the proposed legislation have not been released. “Strong, trusted relationships between police and residents are essential to public safety.” Though unpopular among DC residents – 79% oppose the federal law enforcement incursion, a new Washington Post-Schar School poll said – Trump took to Truth Social on Friday, praising the effort: “Washington, D.C. is SAFE AGAIN!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 60% of Germans express dissatisfaction with the performance of the CDU/CSU-SPD coalition government, according to a recent poll conducted by the INSA sociological institute for Bild am Sonntag. The survey reveals that nearly 60% are unhappy with Chancellor Friedrich Merz's leadership, highlighting a significant decline in public confidence. The poll results show that 62% of respondents are dissatisfied with the work of Germany's ruling coalition, with only 26% rating the government's performance positively. Notably, Merz's support has decreased from 49% when he assumed office in early May. In terms of political party support, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) now stands at 25%, matching the CDU/CSU bloc—marking the conservative parties' worst showing in recent months. Six months ago, in the federal elections, the CDU/CSU secured 28.5%, indicating a loss of 3.5 percentage points over that period. The CDU/CSU and SPD coalition - collectively known as the conservative-red bloc - currently commands only 40% of voter support, insufficient for a parliamentary majority. The SPD itself has dwindled to just 15%, a slight decline from its 16.4% in the recent federal elections, which was its lowest-ever result. The survey was conducted from August 21 to 22, with a sample size of 1,001 respondents. The data on party preferences was gathered between August 18 and 22, involving 1,201 participants. Since early May, when the Bundestag elected Merz as chancellor in a historic second-round vote - an unprecedented event in German history - public confidence has waned. The last elections on February 23 resulted in the fall of the ruling "traffic light coalition", which had collapsed last November over disagreements on budget and financial policies, including further aid to Kiev. In that vote, the CDU/CSU emerged victorious with 28.5%, while the AfD achieved a historic second-place finish with 20.8%.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Erik and Lyle Menendez were denied parole by a California board this week after decades in prison for killing their parents in 1989 at their Beverly Hills mansion. During two days of hearings, the brothers were each questioned by panels of two commissioners and asked to speak with complete candor on the abuse they suffered in childhood, their mindsets leading up to and after the murders and various prison transgressions. Despite each receiving three-year denials, they will be eligible to request an administrative review in one year. While it might not seem like a big deal to the nonincarcerated public, commissioners emphasized to the brothers that their use of illicit cell phones cast a shadow on their positive achievements while behind bars. Cell phones can be used to order hits, move drugs in prison and coordinate attacks on officers, they noted. Lyle Menendez also had two recent cell phone infractions, including one in March. Lyle Menendez denied parole a day after his brother's bid was rejected. He said correctional staffers were monitoring his communications with his wife and family and selling their content to tabloids, so he saw cell phones as a privacy measure. “I had convinced myself that this wasn't a means that was harming anyone but myself in a rule violation,” Lyle Menendez said. “I didn't think it really disrupted prison management very much.” Of the two, Erik Menendez committed more serious rules infractions. Commissioners questioned why he associated himself with a prison gang called the Two Fivers and helped them with a tax scheme around 2013. Menendez said he was trying to survive an “extremely violent yard” where close friends were stabbed or raped. Erik Menendez denied parole after yearslong fight for release “When the Two Fivers came and asked for help, I thought this was a great opportunity to align myself with them and to survive.” Menendez told commissioners that he prioritized protecting himself over the rules because at the time, he had no hope of ever getting out. While Lyle Menendez committed fewer violations, commissioner Julie Garland said he still demonstrated “antisocial personality traits like deception, minimization and rule breaking that lie beneath that positive surface.” Prisoners who break rules are more likely to do so in society as well, she said. Commissioners expressed concerns over the killing of Kitty Menendez, with Barton saying he found that it showed Erik Menendez was “devoid of human compassion” at the time. “But that is still concerning, especially since it seems she was also a victim herself of the domestic violence.” Barton said the brothers were not in imminent fear for their lives and should have sought help from other family members or gone to the police. As for Lyle Menendez, Garland said shooting Kitty Menendez one final time was extremely “callous.” She also highlighted his actions in covering up the crime, such as lying to the police and trying to avoid prosecution. Gavin Newsom previously ordered the California parole board to conduct a risk assessment of the brothers in response to a clemency request. While it was never made public, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman revealed in May that both brothers were deemed “moderate risk.” More than a dozen relatives spoke at the two hearings to advocate for their release. Aunt Teresita Baralt, Jose Menendez's sister, said she is dying from Stage 4 cancer and wishes to welcome them home. Natascha Leonardo, Kitty Menendez's great-niece, promised the parole board that she would provide a home of “unconditional love and stability” for him in Colorado, where he could spend time with family and nature.</p>

Vot Tak said it was unable to confirm the soldier's account of the executions, but that it sent a request to the Prosecutor General of Ukraine for any information about Ukrainian servicemen killed in Karlovka. The Kyiv Independent contacted Ukraine's Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets for comment on the reported events but was not able to reach him before publication. Okhlopkov said he and four or five others in his battalion carried out the executions, which he said were ordered by their commander. Okhlopkov and the soldiers that took part in executions were part of the notorious Somalia Battalion, members of which have been alleged of committing war crimes in the past. Okhlopkov, who was serving time in prison for theft when he signed a contract to join the Russian military, said he deserted the army and is currently in hiding in the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk. Last month, Ukraine's prosecutor general said it had documented at least 273 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) who had been executed by Russia during their captivity, a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. Kyiv and the U.N. have raised the alarm over rising numbers of executions of POWs, saying they point to a systematic policy by Russia to murder Ukrainian captives. Half of the documented cases were recorded this year alone. The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine confirmed in March growing numbers of incidents in which Russian forces killed or maimed surrendering Ukrainian troops. Multiple intelligence reports suggest that Russian soldiers have received explicit orders to kill prisoners of war.

"These sanctions represent 100% synchronization with this year's Canadian sanctions against 139 individuals and entities working for Russia's war," Zelensky said. Meanwhile, Finnish President Alexander Stubb voiced doubts about Russia's readiness for peace in an interview with Helsingin Sanomat, saying, "They (Russia) want to continue the war at least until the fall to maximize their own territorial gains." German media outlet Welt reported, citing anonymous EU sources, that China has signalled it is prepared to send peacekeeping forces to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg is reportedly traveling to Kyiv to mark Ukraine's 34th Independence Day, Reuters journalist Graham Slattery reported Aug. 21 on X. The European Union disbursed more than 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) in financial aid to Ukraine ahead of its 34th Independence Day, underscoring the bloc's continued support for Ukraine amid the ongoing invasion. "I told (Putin) I'm not happy about it," Trump claimed a day after a Russian missile hit an American electronics plant in western Ukraine. Italian police have arrested a Ukrainian national under a European arrest warrant in connection with the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline explosions, German prosecutors announced on Aug. 21.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The neighbors face common challenges from the United States, their mutual ally, and Lee's visit to Japan may help him prepare for his crucial first summit in Washington on Aug. 25 with U.S. President Donald Trump, mainly on trade and defense issues. Japan and South Korea can cooperate in many areas, but also have conflicts because they are so geographically close, Lee said. At a time when global trade and security are shaken, it is more important than ever for the two countries with shared principles to cooperate, he added, calling for increased dialogue through “shuttle diplomacy.” His Tokyo visit before Washington is well received by Japanese officials who see it as a sign Lee is placing great importance to relations between the two neighbors whose ties have repeatedly been disrupted by historical disputes, hampering their trilateral coordination with Washington. The two leaders first met in a closed, small group of officials before summit talks with expanded groups. For Ishiba, who faces pressure from rightwing rivals within his governing party to resign over its July election loss, Lee's visit and a successful summit could shore up his support. Japan's PM vows to stay as ruling party loses majority and far-right surges Possible outcomes of the meeting include fast-track entry visas for South Korean travelers and working holiday programs. In an interview with Japan's conservative Yomiuri newspaper published Thursday, Lee also said he will stick to past agreements with the Japanese government on the forced labor issues and sexual abuses of the so-called “comfort women,” though hard feelings remain among many Koreans. Ishiba, who has acknowledged Japan's wartime aggression and shown empathy toward Asian victims, expressed “remorse” over the war, which he called a mistake, restoring the word in a Japanese leader's Aug. 15 surrender anniversary address for the first time since its 2013 removal by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Camp at Fort Bliss base on US-Mexico border described as ‘dangerous misuse of military land and resources' Prominent Democratic lawmakers and legal advocates have called for the new immigration detention camp at Fort Bliss military base to be shut down amid accusations of lack of external oversight and concerns over access to legal services. Camp East Montana began full operation last weekend as a sprawling tent facility across acres of military land in the eastern part of El Paso, on the US-Mexico border in west Texas, amid rapid expansion plans and much controversy. After a brief tour of the site on Thursday, Texas Democratic congresswoman Jasmine Crockett said: “What I saw today was a dangerous misuse of military land and resources to cage human beings. This attempt doesn't make our country safer, it wastes taxpayer dollars, rips families apart, and takes us backwards as a nation.” El Paso Democratic congresswoman Veronica Escobar called the new camp “massive” and decried the $1.2bn price tag when such a sum could elevate public services in a city like El Paso. She told local media it would be a strain on the city's resources. She added: “The shameful use of a military base for immigration detention is a disgrace to the values of our city and our country” and called for “rigorous oversight”, pledging that “we will document every abuse”. Ice, part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has said Camp East Montana will serve as a short-term processing site to “decompress” other detention centers amid accelerating arrests and will handle deportations via Ice air operations. Acquisition Logistics, based in Henrico county, Virginia was awarded a $231.8m initial contract to establish and operate the facility, which Ice will manage and, the federal agency said, be in line with its detention standards. “The Fort Bliss facility will offer everything a traditional Ice detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals. It also provides necessary accommodations for disabilities, diet, and religious beliefs,” the statement said. Crockett said she briefed the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and several immigrant rights advocates in El Paso and southern New Mexico on her observations, as some legal advocates have been unable to meet with detainees. Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning “When people are locked away in remote facilities, far from courts and far from their families, the right to legal representation becomes an empty promise,” he said. Texas Republican congressman John Cornyn said the facility would be used for those with final deportation orders and those with criminal convictions as a short term processing location before expulsion from the US. “We already know that the use of military bases for mass detention is wasteful, intentionally cruel and unnecessary. Yet here we are,” said Marisa Limón Garza, the executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center. “It's really just about targeting people, racial profiling and rounding up of numbers to meet quotas, which is ignoring humanity and any kind of right to being a dignified person,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Days ago, the US president was optimistic that Vladimir Putin wanted to agree a ceasefire in Ukraine A week after Donald Trump applauded Vladimir Putin down the red carpet in Alaska, and days after an unprecedented summit of European leaders at the White House, the American president came crashing down to earth on Friday. Russia is still bombing Ukraine and in the past few days Moscow has put up more roadblocks to peace. I'm really not sure,” said a retired senior State Department official. Last Friday, Mr Trump made an effort to kickstart talks by meeting Putin in Alaska. Mr Trump appeared willing to offer US security guarantees for Ukraine, if a peace deal could be struck. That was a major step forward for Kyiv and its European allies. And he even said that Putin agreed to accept security guarantees. “I think he wants to make a deal for me, you understand, as crazy as it sounds,” he told Emmanuel Macron, the French president. Leaders in the room – including Sir Keir Starmer, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Germany's Friedrich Merz and Finland's Alexander Stubb – came away thinking they had done enough to cancel out any advantage Putin might have gained, and enthused about the way that Mr Trump was committed to the process. A senior European diplomat said Mr Trump had “placed his hand in the mangle”. But since then, Mr Trump has rowed back on any suggestion of American troops taking part in a security force. And Russia made clear that any security guarantees would be subject to a Russian veto – a rather more complicated position than Mr Trump announced after Alaska. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said: “Moscow won't agree with collective security guarantees negotiated without Russia … John Herbst, former US ambassador to Ukraine, said the Trump administration had made a serious tactical error earlier in the month when it ditched a deadline for secondary sanctions and began planning for the Alaska summit. However, the historic assembly of European leaders on Monday meant Putin was not having it all his own way, added Mr Herbst. And so that means his friendliness to Putin is offset by this,” he said. “You didn't have it to this degree at any time in the first term. Even so, Russia flexed its military muscle on Wednesday night, launching a rare drone and missile strike on Western Ukraine and hitting targets that included an American-owned electronics plant. Mr Trump responded with a cryptic social media post. “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader's country,” he posted on Truth Social, blasting his predecessor for limiting Ukraine's ability to hit at Russia. “It's just an observation,” said Steven Cheung, White House communications director.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Activist Joshua Rubin protests at the entrance to 'Alligator Alcatraz' at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport on Thursday in Ochopee, Fla.Joe Raedle/Getty Images A federal judge has put a stop to further expansion of the immigration detention centre built in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” ordering that its operations wind down within two months. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in Miami wrote in her 82-page order late Thursday that Florida officials never sufficiently explained why an immigration detention centre needed to be located in the middle of sensitive wetlands cherished by environmentalists and outdoors people. She also said that state and federal authorities never undertook an environmental review as required by federal law before Florida officials hastily built the detention camp which they championed as a model for U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration policies. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis on Friday reacted to the ruling, saying he would not be deterred by “an activist judge.” A federal judge has put a stop to further expansion of the immigration detention centre built in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz," ordering that its operations wind down within two months. Once that happens, fencing, lighting, gas, waste, generators and other equipment should be removed from the site. No additional detainees can be sent to the facility, and no more additional lighting, fencing, paving, buildings or tents can be added to the camp. However, the judge allowed for the existing dormitories and housing to stay in place as long as they are maintained to prevent deterioration or damage. During court hearings, lawyers said at one point there were fewer than 1,000 detainees at the facility, which state officials had planned to hold up to 3,000 people. Earlier this month, DeSantis announced plans for a second state-initiated immigration detention facility dubbed “Deportation Depot” at a state prison about 69 kilometres west of downtown Jacksonville. U.S. detainees describe worm-filled food, inhuman treatment at ‘Alligator Alcatraz' migrant centre Civil rights lawyers had filed a second lawsuit over practices at “Alligator Alcatraz,” claiming that detainees weren't able to meet with their attorneys privately and were denied access to immigration courts. “Our case addresses the lack of access to counsel for people detained at Alligator Alcatraz, and there are still people detained there,” Cho said. No one has said publicly what will happen to the hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts involved in the facility. That amount – to be fronted by Florida taxpayers – was in line with the US$450-million a year officials have estimated the facility was going to cost. As its name suggests, a preliminary injunction is only an initial action taken by a judge to prevent harm while a lawsuit makes its way through the court process and when it appears that one side has a good chance of succeeding based on the merits of the case.

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — The world's leading authority on food crises said Friday the Gaza Strip's largest city is gripped by famine, and that it's likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is happening in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month. The determination comes after months of warnings by aid groups that Israel's restrictions of food and other aid into Gaza, and its military offensive, were causing starvation among Palestinian civilians, particularly children. Israel rejected the report, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it an “outright lie.” Israel says it plans to seize Gaza City and other Hamas strongholds, an escalation experts say will exacerbate the hunger crisis. More than half a million people in Gaza, about a quarter of its population, face catastrophic levels of hunger, with many at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes, the IPC report said. Netanyahu denies there's hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation “lies” promoted by Hamas. Israel does not have a policy of starvation,” his office posted on X. It said the humanitarian situation in Gaza “is a serious concern,” but blamed Hamas and looters for the difficulties in delivering aid. Israel's Foreign Ministry said more than 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, including a massive influx in recent weeks. “A rapidly increasing number of people, especially young children, are dying preventable deaths from starvation and disease because Israel made starvation a core part of its campaign to control the strip,” said Chris Newton, an analyst for the International Crisis Group. Netanyahu says more military pressure is needed to achieve Israel's goals of freeing the hostages held by Hamas and eliminating the militant group altogether. At least 30% of children 6 months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, based on a weight-to-height measurement; or 15% of that age group suffer from acute malnutrition based on the circumference of their upper arm. And at least two people, or four children under 5, per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease. The data analyzed between July 1 and Aug. 15 showed clear evidence that thresholds for starvation and acute malnutrition have been reached. Alex de Waal, author of “Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine” and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, said that had Israel allowed the IPC better access to collect data, a famine might have been determined months ago, which would have raised global awareness sooner. before the world takes notice, by which time it is too late,” he said. Israel has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. It says there's currently no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza. It also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that requires Palestinians to travel long distances and pass through Israeli military lines to get aid. The traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds overwhelm entering convoys. Witnesses, health officials and the U.N. rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid from both providers, while Israel says it has only fired warning shots and that the toll is exaggerated. Hundreds of thousands fled under Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year. Kirsty Blacka, an Australian emergency nurse who worked in Gaza City's Al-Quds hospital through June, said emaciated men with no preexisting conditions were coming in looking like teenagers because they were starving. She said the lack of food has been compounded by contaminated water causing diarrhea and infections, and that diseases are harder to recover from when people are malnourished. Families in Gaza City say they're watching their loved ones waste away. Yousef Sbeteh's two teenage children were wounded by an Israeli airstrike in June and have spent the last two months in the hospital. While there, they've both lost weight because there hasn't been enough food, he said, adding that he can't afford to buy more because prices at markets have soared. Doctors say the teenagers had no preexisting conditions. Her 17-year-old brother Ahmad has lost about 15 kilograms (33 pounds). The lack of nutritional supplements and healthy food is slowing their recovery, doctors say. “Doctors say she needs protein, meat and fish,” Sbeteh said while sitting beside his frail daughter.
