                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the most promising approaches to overcoming this challenge is topological quantum computing, which aims to protect quantum information by encoding it in the geometric properties of exotic particles called anyons. "Among the leading candidates for building such a computer are Ising anyons, which are already being intensely investigated in condensed matter labs due to their potential realization in exotic systems like the fractional quantum Hall state and topological superconductors," said Aaron Lauda, professor of mathematics, physics and astronomy at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the study's senior author. "On their own, Ising anyons can't perform all the operations needed for a general-purpose quantum computer. The computations they support rely on 'braiding,' physically moving anyons around one another to carry out quantum logic. For Ising anyons, this braiding only enables a limited set of operations known as Clifford gates, which fall short of the full power required for universal quantum computing." By adding a single new type of anyon, which was previously discarded in traditional approaches to topological quantum computation, the team shows that Ising anyons can be made universal, capable of performing any quantum computation through braiding alone. These extend the standard "semisimple" frameworks that physicists typically use to describe anyons. Traditional models simplify the underlying math by discarding objects with so-called "quantum trace zero," effectively declaring them useless. "But those discarded objects turn out to be the missing piece," Lauda explained. "It's like finding treasure in what everyone else thought was mathematical garbage." The new framework retains these neglected components and reveals a new type of anyon -- the neglecton -- which, when combined with Ising anyons, allows for universal computation using braiding alone. Most physicists would have seen this as a fatal flaw. They designed their quantum encoding to isolate these mathematical irregularities away from the actual computation. "Instead of fixing every room, you ensure all of your computing happens in the structurally sound areas while keeping the problematic spaces off-limits." The breakthrough illustrates how abstract mathematics can solve concrete engineering problems in unexpected ways. "By embracing mathematical structures that were previously considered useless, we unlocked a whole new chapter for quantum information science," Lauda said. On the experimental side, they aim to identify specific material platforms where the stationary neglecton could arise and to develop protocols that translate their braiding-based approach into realizable quantum operations. "What's particularly exciting is that this work moves us closer to universal quantum computing with particles we already know how to create," Lauda said. "The math gives a clear target: If experimentalists can find a way to realize this extra stationary anyon, it could unlock the full power of Ising-based systems."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The brain's body map doesn't reorganize itself after limb amputation, a study found, challenging a textbook idea in neuroscience A brain-imaging study of people with amputated arms has upended a long-standing belief: that the brain's map of the body reorganizes itself to compensate for missing body parts. But the latest findings, published in Nature Neuroscience on 21 August, reveal that the primary somatosensory cortex stays remarkably constant even years after arm amputation.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. “Pretty much every neuroscientist has learnt through their textbook that the brain has the capacity for reorganization, and this is demonstrated through studies on amputees,” says study senior author Tamar Makin, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. But “textbooks can be wrong”, she adds. “We shouldn't take anything for granted, especially when it comes to brain research.” It could also help scientists working to restore sensation in people who have had amputations. Study first author Hunter Schone, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, says that previous reports from some people with amputations had led him and his colleagues to doubt the idea that the brain's map of the body is reorganized after amputation. These maps are responsible for processing sensory information, such as touch or temperature, at specific body regions. To investigate this contradiction, the researchers followed three people who were due to undergo amputation of one of their arms. It is the first study to do this. Solaiman Shokur, a neuroengineer at the Sant'anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, Italy, says he was surprised to see the evidence shown “in such a clear manner” and that the results “contradict something that is believed in the field, and do so to some extent”. He says that the findings could have implications for research on prosthetic limbs that are controlled through brain–computer interfaces implanted in the somatosensory cortex. The information is relevant to the recruitment of volunteers in clinical trials of such devices and for potential participants who might benefit from brain–computer interfaces, he says. The study authors note that their findings also explain why treatments for phantom limb pain aimed at ‘reversing' reorganization in the brain's map have shown limited success. “Researchers may have missed the profound resilience of cortical representations,” they write.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by the University of Oxford in collaboration with Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, University of Greenwich, and the Technical University of Denmark could provide a cost-effective and sustainable solution to help tackle the devastating decline in honeybees. Climate change and agricultural intensification have increasingly deprived honeybees of the floral diversity they need to thrive. However, these commercial supplements -- made of protein flour, sugars, and oils -- lack the right sterol compounds, making them nutritionally incomplete. This was then incorporated into diets fed to bee colonies during three-month feeding trials. Senior author Professor Geraldine Wright (Department of Biology, University of Oxford), said: "Our study demonstrates how we can harness synthetic biology to solve real-world ecological challenges. Using precision fermentation, we are now able to provide bees with a tailor-made feed that is nutritionally complete at the molecular level." From pollen to precision nutrition: Identifying and producing key bee sterols Before this work, it was unclear which of the diverse sterols in pollen were critical for bee health. This required some extraordinarily delicate work; for instance, dissecting individual nurse bees to separate the guts. To produce the sterol-enriched supplement, engineered yeast biomass was cultured in bioreactors, harvested, then dried into a powder. Co-author Professor Irina Borodina (The NNF Center for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark) said: "We chose oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as the cell factory because it is excellent at making compounds derived from acetyl-CoA, such as lipids and sterols, and because this yeast is safe and easy to scale up. It is used industrially to produce enzymes, omega-3 fatty acids, steviol glycosides as calorie-free sweeteners, pheromones for pest control, and other products." Severe declines -- caused by a combination of nutrient deficiencies, climate change, mite infestations, viral diseases, and pesticide exposure -- poses a significant threat to food security and biodiversity. This new engineered supplement offers a practical means to enhance colony resilience without further depleting natural floral resources. Since the yeast biomass also contains beneficial proteins and lipids, it could potentially be expanded into a comprehensive bee feed. Co-author Professor Phil Stevenson (RBG Kew and Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich) added: "Honey bees are critically important pollinators for the production of crops such as almonds, apples, and cherries and so are present in some crop locations in very large numbers, which can put pressure on limited wildflowers. Our engineered supplement could therefore benefit wild bee species by reducing competition for limited pollen supplies." Danielle Downey (Executive Director of honeybee research nonprofit Project Apis m., not affiliated with the study) said: "We rely on honey bees to pollinate one in three bites of our food, yet bees face many stressors. Good nutrition is one way to improve their resilience to these threats, and in landscapes with dwindling natural forage for bees, a more complete diet supplement could be a game changer. This breakthrough discovery of key phytonutrients that, when included in feed supplements, allow sustained honey bee brood rearing has immense potential to improve outcomes for colony survival, and in turn the beekeeping businesses we rely on for our food production." Potentially, the supplement could be available to farmers within two years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If an extraterrestrial intelligence were looking for signs of human communications, when and where should they look? In a new study, researchers at Penn State and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California analyzed when and where human deep space transmissions would be most detectable by an observer outside our solar system and suggest that the patterns they see could be used to guide our own search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). "But a planet like Mars does not block the entire transmission, so a distant spacecraft or planet positioned along the path of these interplanetary communications could potentially detect the spillover; that would occur when Earth and another solar system planet align from their perspective. "Considering the direction and frequency of our most common signals gives insights into where we should be looking to improve our chances of detecting alien technosignatures." The researchers analyzed logs from NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN), a system of ground-based facilities that permits two-way radio communications with human-made objects in space, acting as a relay to send commands to spacecraft and receive information they send back. For this study, the researchers focused on transmissions to deep space, including transmissions to telescopes in space as well as interplanetary spacecraft, instead of transmissions intended for spacecraft or satellites in low-Earth orbit, which are relatively low power and would be difficult to detect from a distance. The researchers found that deep space radio signals were predominantly directed toward spacecraft near Mars. Other common transmissions were directed toward other planets and to telescopes at Sun-Earth Lagrange points -- points in space where the gravity of the Sun and Earth keep the telescopes in a relatively fixed position as viewed from Earth. "Based on data from the last 20 years, we found that if an extraterrestrial intelligence were in a location that could observe the alignment of Earth and Mars, there's a 77% chance that they would be in the path of one of our transmissions -- orders of magnitude more likely than being in a random position at a random time, Fan said. When not observing a planet alignment, however, these chances are minuscule." To improve our own search for technosignatures, the researchers said, humans should look for alignment of exoplanets -- planets outside our solar system -- or at least when exoplanets align with their host star. Astronomers frequently study exoplanets during alignment with their host star. "However, because we are only starting to detect a lot of exoplanets in the last decade or two, we do not know many systems with two or more transiting exoplanets," Fan said. "With the upcoming launch of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, we expect to detect a hundred thousand previously undetected exoplanets, so our potential search area should increase greatly." The research team also calculated that an average DSN transmission could be detected about 23 light-years away using telescopes like ours. Focusing efforts, they said, on solar systems that are within 23 light-years and especially whose plane is oriented with its edge toward Earth could improve our search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The team now plans to identify these systems and quantify how frequently they could have received signals coming from Earth. The DSN transmission patterns found also could be applied to searches for laser transmissions from exoplanets, the researchers said, though they noted that lasers would have much less spillover than radio transmission. NASA is testing its interplanetary laser communication system, and extraterrestrial civilizations may opt to use lasers instead of radio waves. "Humans are pretty early in our spacefaring journey, and as we reach further into our solar system, our transmissions to other planets will only increase," said Jason Wright, professor of astronomy and astrophysics in the Penn State Eberly College of Science, director of the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center, and an author of the paper. "Using our own deep space communications as a baseline, we quantified how future searchers for extraterrestrial intelligence could be improved by focusing on systems with particular orientations and planet alignments."
