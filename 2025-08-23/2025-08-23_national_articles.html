Up to 1,700 National Guardsmen are set to mobilize in 19 states in the coming weeks to assist the Department of Homeland Security with the administration's nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration. That operation was initially announced last month and is not linked to potential federal intervention in crime-plagued cities, a White House official told Fox News. "This isn't new nor is it tied to the President's efforts to address violent crime in DC," the official said late Friday. "DoD announced last month that National Guard troops would assist DHS with clerical support and other logistical tasks for processing illegal aliens at ICE facilities. It is separate from the federal interagency crime crackdown." Trump activated the National Guard in Washington, D.C., earlier this month as part of an effort to slash violent crime in the nation's capital. Touting the operation's success — at least 465 arrests have been made — Trump has signaled he intends to broaden the D.C. mission to other cities. "We're going to make it safe, and we're going to then go on to other places," he told federal agents and Guard troops Thursday at a D.C. patrol center. On Friday, Trump added, "I think Chicago will be our next. And then we'll help with New York." President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Trump said he was considering broadening his federal crime crackdown to Chicago and New York. The deployment of 1,700 National Guardsmen was first announced on July 25 in a Pentagon press release. Their roles include collecting personal data, fingerprinting, DNA swabbing and photographing detainees so ICE agents can focus on enforcement. Under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, the use of federal armed forces for civilian law enforcement is generally prohibited. But the National Guard will operate under Title 32 Section 502F authority, which does not apply to Posse Comitatus. At the request of DHS, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in July approved hundreds of additional forces for ICE support and switched existing approvals from Title 10 to Title 32 status. "We understood ICE's needs at that time to be more administrative in nature… as planning continued, working with our partners, it became clear more that ICE needed something different," a U.S. defense official told Fox News. Meanwhile, 2,279 National Guard soldiers and airmen from Washington, D.C., and six states are already mobilized in the capital, having completed training, according to a Joint Task Force spokesperson. At least 465 arrests have been made since the crime crunch in Washington D.C. went into operation. Under direct presidential authority, Guard members have been posted to monuments, checkpoints and traffic stops across all eight wards, with a mission of deterring crime and maintaining a visible security presence. At Hegseth's authorization, those Guard members can now carry weapons if needed. But unlike the states, where Guard forces fall under governors' command, in D.C. they operate under direct presidential authority. National Guard forces are carrying out presence patrols across Washington, D.C., including at Metro stations, Union Station, the National Mall and alongside U.S. Park Police. Officials have also linked the D.C. operation to beautification efforts ahead of next year's 250th Independence Day celebration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from jail in Tennessee on Friday so he can rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, center, leaves the Putnam County Jail, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Cookeville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Brett Carlsen) The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday and included a requirement that he remain in jail, according to a brief filed in Tennessee, where the criminal case was brought. After Abrego Garcia left jail on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday. Later on Friday, “the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning — precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office — to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,” his defense attorneys wrote. They declined to say whether he is still considering the offer. Filed along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face the possibility of detention. An additional benefit of the offer would be that Costa Rica is a Spanish-speaking country, like Abrego Garcia's native El Salvador. Abrego Garcia would only be deported to Costa Rica after serving his sentence on the smuggling charges, according to the brief. Abrego Garcia's case became a flash point in President Donald Trump's immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a judge's earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges. “Despite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego's counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office Monday morning,” the brief says, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning. A Department of Homeland Security agent later testified that he didn't begin investigating the traffic stop until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. “Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” it states. Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador. “There is a perfectly reasonable option available, Costa Rica, where he his family can visit him easily, but instead they are attempting to send him halfway across the world, to a country with documented human rights abuses and where he does not even speak the language,” he said in a statement.</p>

The left continues to maintain strong opposition of President Donald Trump's efforts to hinder crime in the nation's capital. (Credit: Nicholas Ballasy from Fox News Digital) Protesters continue to blast the Trump administration's takeover of policing in Washington, DC, likening it to an "invasion" even as crime plummets. Demonstrators, who did not appear to be part of a specific organization, on a pedestrian bridge on the I-95 in Virginia near the city this week, said that "our systems are being assaulted." "What the problem is, is that these are the National Guard are like my friends' sons and daughters," one woman told Fox News Digital. The money being wasted to make a point is really sort of disgraceful and un-American because they're sending them against actual Americans with weapons. DC Metropolitan Police detain a person after an altercation between members of the public in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 14, 2025. The DC Police Union says crime has taken a tumble in since the takeover was announced by President Donald Trump earlier this month. On Thursday, it was noted that there were no reported homicides in the city in the past week. Attorney General Pam Bondi signed an order that prompts local officers to comply with federal immigration authorities in a strong rebuke to the city's own sanctuary policies. "719 arrests and 91 illegal guns seized in Washington, DC Just yesterday we made 40 arrests, took 5 more illegal firearms off our streets, and had 36 ICE arrests—including a suspected MS-13 gang member. Thank you [President Trump] for your unwavering support to make DC safe again!" Bondi posted to X on Friday morning. Trump has threatened to take the takeover a step further in a Truth Social post on Friday. The crowds are coming back, the spirit is high, and our D.C. National Guard and Police are doing a fantastic job. "As bad as it sounds to say, there were no murders this week for the first time in memory. Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen, including a complete and total Federal takeover of the City! U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) conduct a traffic stop near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC. Another protester noted that he is glad to see that crime has dropped in the city, but said declaring the crime issue in Washington D.C. was not necessary. "I really do believe that we are edging into an area where we are not following the law, where we're not doing the things that we need to be doing in order to serve the people," he said. "I'm very happy that crime's down, and it doesn't surprise me at all if you're going to have troops and a lot of people having law enforcement on the streets," he said. "The problem with this is that we are making an emergency out of something that wasn't an emergency." Cameron Arcand is a politics writer at Fox News Digital in Washington D.C.

Former FBI special agent Nicole Parker joins ‘America Reports' to break down the FBI raid on former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton's home in Maryland and office in Washington, D.C. Former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who served under President Donald Trump's first administration, was the subject of FBI raids at his home and office Friday morning as federal authorities searched for classified documents. News broke early Friday morning that FBI agents flocked around Bolton's Maryland home and were seen carrying out boxes, which was followed hours later by the FBI raiding Bolton's Washington, D.C., office. "I'm not a fan of John Bolton," Trump told reporters on Friday morning after the raids began, adding he saw the reports but was not aware of details on the raid ahead of time. FBI agents left John Bolton's office in Washington after obtaining documents. The remarks echo years of past comments the pair have shared in public forums airing their dissatisfactions with one another, most notably after Trump tapped Bolton to serve as his national security advisor in 2018. "I like (Bolton)," Trump said in 2015 while appearing on "Meet the Press" just weeks after announcing his candidacy for the White House. President Donald Trump said he was not aware of the raids on John Bolton's home and office before they were carried out Aug. 22, 2025. Bolton was first speculated as a likely pick to serve as Trump's secretary of state in December 2016, when Trump was preparing for his first inauguration after his upset victory over Hillary Clinton in the election that year. Pundits touted Bolton as an experienced foreign policy hawk who could bolster Trump's diplomatic agenda, and conservative outlets such as the National Review's editorial board implored the Trump transition team to choose Bolton, identifying him as a "hard-headed realist whose focus is always the national interest." Trump, however, ultimately tapped Rex Tillerson to serve as secretary of state. Bolton showered Trump with praise of his own ahead of his confirmation as national security advisor in 2018, calling the president "a terrific guy" who "knows a lot" when the administration kicked off in 2017. John Bolton served as President Trump's national security advisor from 2018 to 2019, for a total of about 17 months. The warm relationship got cozier when Trump announced in 2018 on X that he called on Bolton to serve as his national security advisor "I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. FBI agents outside the Maryland home of former National Security Advisor John Bolton Aug. 22, 2025. Trump ultimately pulled the U.S. out of the agreement in 2018, slamming it as a "horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made," and was backed by his hawkish group of foreign policy advisors, such as Bolton and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Bolton's relationship with Trump began to sour as he advanced hard-line strategies toward U.S. adversaries, including Iran and North Korea. He had long advocated regime change in Tehran, though he later clarified in his role as national security advisor that American policy was "not regime change," but rather a push for "massive change in the regime's behavior." Trump, by contrast, initially favored a more diplomatic path, urging that flaws he saw in the Iran nuclear deal be renegotiated before ultimately deciding to withdraw from the agreement altogether. If it was up to him, he'd take on the whole world at one time, okay?" In April 2018, Bolton suggested North Korea follow Libya's example of denuclearization, which he called the "Libya model," and included the country giving up its nuclear weapons in 2003 in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Bolton's comments about such a model for North Korea set off condemnation in Pyongyang as they raised concerns this would lead to potential regime change. "We were set back very badly when John Bolton talked about the Libyan model … what a disaster," Trump told reporters at the time. Days ahead of Bolton's ouster, Trump was slated to meet with Taliban leaders in an effort to negotiate peace in Afghanistan, but the meeting never took place and Bolton reportedly slammed such an effort in conversations with Trump, media outlets reported at the time. FBI agents load bags into a vehicle after conducting a search at the Washington, D.C., office of former National Security Advisor John Bolton on Aug. 22, 2025. Bolton was ousted from his role as national security advisor Sept. 10, 2019, with Trump characterizing the departure as a firing, and Bolton saying he tendered his resignation and was not fired. "I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House," Trump tweeted in 2019. "I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week." Bolton shot back on X that he "offered to resign last night and President Trump said, ‘Let's talk about it tomorrow.'" The former national security advisor was replaced by Robert C. O'Brien, with Trump and Bolton continuing their contentious relationship years later. The raid on Bolton's home is part of the "early stages of an ongoing investigation into John Bolton," Vice President JD Vance said Friday during an appearance on "Meet the Press." Bolton was not arrested or in custody amid the early morning raids. The searches are focused on potential classified documents agents believe Bolton may still possess, Fox News reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp resigned Friday evening, after he failed to secure new sanctions against Israel over the war in Gaza. Veldkamp had informed the country's parliament he intended to bring in new measures in response to Israel's planned offensive in Gaza City and other heavily populated areas but was unable to secure the support of his coalition partners. The 61-year-old former ambassador to Israel told reporters he felt he was unable “to implement policy myself and chart the course I deem necessary.” “In short we are done with it,” party leader Eddy Van Hijum said, calling the Israeli government's actions “diametrically opposed to international treaties.” The Dutch government already collapsed in June when anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders pulled out of the country's four-party coalition over a fight about immigration. The world's leading authority on food crises said earlier on Friday the Gaza Strip's largest city is gripped by famine, and that it's likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid. The Netherlands' Parliament had repeatedly delayed a debate on sanctions against Israel, a discussion that was already postponed from Thursday, as the Friday afternoon Cabinet meeting dragged on. “There's a famine, ethnic cleansing, and genocide going on,” Kati Piri of the merged Green Left/Labor parties told Parliament, “And our cabinet has been deliberating for hours about whether to take any action at all. Veldkamp had proposed a ban on imports from Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories in response to the planned military escalation. Opposition politicians had called for a no-confidence vote for the minister, frustrated at what they saw as a lack of action against Israel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Friday expanded his ruling blocking the Trump administration from cancelling government funding to dozens of accused sanctuary jurisdictions. San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Orrick in April ruled in favor of 16 counties and cities that sued the Trump administration's efforts to rescind billions in funding due to criticism that their policies on illegal immigrants were out of compliance with federal immigration law. Orrick's preliminary injunction further blocks the Trump administration from ending funding to 34 additional cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Boston, and Baltimore. Attorney General Pam Bondi at the Justice Department has sued multiple cities over the issue, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has also spearheaded efforts to target illegal immigrants. On Jan. 20, the president issued an executive order that directed Bondi and Noem to ensure “sanctuary jurisdictions “do not receive access to federal funds.” The April 28 directive ordered his administration, led by Bondi and Noem, to draw up a list of sanctuary cities that are not complying with federal immigration laws. Bondi and Noem released a list of over 500 such “sanctuary jurisdictions” in late May that was later taken offline. The list was originally published on the DHS website, with officials sending notices to each city stating that the government considers it noncompliant with federal immigration law and may be violating federal criminal statutes. Months later, Bondi in August issued a significantly smaller list highlighting top sanctuary jurisdictions on the Trump administration's radar, including 13 states, four counties, and 18 cities, and threatening further lawsuits from places that refuse to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Later that month, she reiterated a sharp admonition to governing officials, stating they could soon lose federal funding if they continued to block cooperation with ICE.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And the hard-throwing 22-year-old confirmed those credentials in his major league debut, becoming the first pitcher to throw four scoreless innings and record a save in his debut since saves became an officially recognized statistic in 1969, according to AP. He allowed just two hits and struck out three in those four innings, needing 40 pitches to get the 12 outs and clinch a 9-0 win for the Pirates against the Colorado Rockies. Although he gave up a double to the first batter he faced, Orlando Arcia, he rallied and struck out Ryan Ritter and Mickey Moniak, while Tyler Freeman ground out, stranding Arcia. Chandler's decisive pitches to Ritter and Moniak clocked in at 99.9 mph and 100.4 mph, respectively – the fastest pitches for strikeouts that any Pirate has thrown this year. “Welcome to the show, huh,” Chandler said afterward, recalling Arcia's double. “Thought I made a good pitch but he hit it pretty hard. Kind of a scare, you don't want to give up a homer on your first at-bat but it was pretty sweet. After that at-bat, my emotions kind of slowed down and it was great.” Despite being just 22 years old, Chandler's impressive performances at Triple-A Indianapolis made him “mad” that he hadn't been called up already. “There's not a lot of 22-year-old kids that get to do this. But at the same time I didn't need to take care of what I needed to take care of, so that falls back on me. I've never really been a stressed-out guy, but I have been the past couple months just trying to get here.” Chandler's emergence further strengthens the Pirates' pitching staff, which also includes last year's NL Rookie of the Year Paul Skenes. Yu Darvish allowed just one hit across six innings and combined with three relievers to dominate the Dodgers. Meanwhile, the Boston Red Sox took a 1-0 victory against the New York Yankees behind Brayan Bello's seven scoreless innings, securing the season series over their rivals.</p>

Two teenagers charged in connection with an attempted carjacking and brutal beating of a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer earlier this month have been released from youth custody. A 15-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, who were charged with unarmed carjacking days after the attack, have been given lighter restrictions. Since their arrest, the suspects had been held at D.C.'s Youth Services Center (YSC), where juveniles are placed in secure detention by court order. According to reports, Judge Kendra D. Briggs, who was nominated by then-President Joe Biden in 2021, ruled that one of the teens would be sent to a youth shelter while the other would be granted home arrest. U.S. National Guard is deployed around downtown Los Angeles on Sunday, June 8, 2025, following an immigration raid protest the night before. While the teens are being released from the YSC, they are still subject to curfews, weekly drug tests and electronic monitoring, NBC4 Washington reported. On Aug. 3, Edward Coristine, better known by his nickname, "Big Balls," was assaulted at approximately 3:00 a.m. by a group of teenagers in the city's Logan Circle neighborhood. The teens allegedly attempted to carjack him and a woman, whom police identified as his significant other, according to authorities. At least several of the teens then attacked him, police said, until officers patrolling nearby intervened. Former DOGE employee Edward "Big Balls" Coristine was attacked Monday while trying to help a woman, according to sources. A photo of a bloodied Coristine went viral, sparking outrage over the city's handling of crime and drawing President Donald Trump's attention. "Local ‘youths' and gang members, some only 14, 15, and 16-years-old, are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent citizens, at the same time knowing that they will be almost immediately released. They are not afraid of Law Enforcement because they know nothing ever happens to them, but it's going to happen now!" Briggs' ruling comes amid a heated debate on the handling of crime in D.C. and Trump's crime crackdown. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the move, saying that "there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C."

(Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo) His approach appears to be working, as Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital that there has not been a homicide in the city in more than a week, coinciding with the takeover. While many connected Trump's decision to federalize D.C. to Coristine's assault, it was a topic he touched on during his presidential campaign. He spoke about the need to better secure D.C. after the tragic January 2024 murder of Mike Gill, a Republican who worked under the Obama and Trump administrations. Gill was waiting to pick up his wife from work when an armed carjacker opened fire in broad daylight. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

As the Republican National Committee elects Joe Gruters as chair, succeeding Michael Whatley, the incoming and outgoing chairs stand for an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, at the RNC's summer meeting in Atlanta. In a political party where politicians who call Florida home have risen to the heights of power, it's no surprise that the new chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) hails from the Sunshine State. Joe Gruters, a longtime ally of Florida resident President Donald Trump, was unanimously elected Friday as RNC chair at the national party committee's summer meeting. Gruters is a Florida state senator, RNC committee member from the Sunshine State, and, briefly, the national party committee's treasurer before stepping down after being elected chair. Newly elected Republican National Committee Chair Joe Gruters is interviewed by Fox News Digital at the RNC summer meeting, on Aug. 22, 2025, in Atlanta, Georgia. He's also close with another Floridian, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, who was co-campaign manager of Trump's 2024 presidential bid. Gruters succeeded now-former chair Michael Whatley, who stepped down as he runs for the Senate in North Carolina in the blockbuster race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Thom Tillis. Joe Gruters (right) and Michael Whatley at the Republican National Committee summer meeting. "Congratulations to MAGA Warrior Joe Gruters, who I very strongly Endorsed, on his unanimous Election as Chairman of the Republican National Committee," Trump wrote in a social media post following Gruters' ascension to RNC chair. Trump touted that Gruters "helped us deliver Massive and Historic Victories" in the Sunshine State and "helped us turn Florida, RED AS RED CAN BE!" Donald Trump cuts short an introduction by Joe Gruters, then-chairman of the Republican Executive Committee of Sarasota County, before Trump was presented as its Statesman of the Year, in Sarasota, Florida, on Aug. 26, 2012. The party fully embraces the president," Gruters said as he and Whatley stood for an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital. And Gruters is looking to the president as Republicans defend their House and Senate majoritues in next year's midterm elections. Gruters has often clashed with another Floridian, two-term Republican governor, Ron DeSantis. Gruters backed Trump over DeSantis in the 2024 Republican presidential nomination race.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke speaks during a rally at the State Capitol, Aug. 16, 2025, in Austin, Texas, against congressional redistricting efforts by Texas Republicans and President Donald Trump. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC 2024, at the National Harbor in Oxon Hill, Md., Feb. 23, 2024. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas questions U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer as he testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, April 8, 2025. HOUSTON (AP) — Just as Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Colin Allred was holding a town hall near the Mexican border as part of an “unrig Texas” campaign tour, the state's Democratic fundraising powerhouse Beto O'Rourke rallied support in Austin for lawmakers who left the state to delay a redistricting plan led by President Donald Trump. The next morning, one of those wayward lawmakers, James Talarico, stood in the pulpit at former President Barack Obama's old church in Chicago to say he and his fellow legislators had simply taken a leap of faith. All three Democrats are either declared or potential contenders for the Senate seat on the ballot in next year's midterm elections. In what would typically be a quiet period in Texas politics, Republicans have roiled the state's 2026 Senate campaign with their rush to redraw congressional maps to give Trump more allies in Congress. The turmoil impacts contenders in both parties and gives Democrats fresh hope that they can capture a long-elusive seat, where an upset would dramatically improve their chances of regaining Senate control in Washington. For Democrats, the GOP power play offers a new way to stand out as fighters against Trump and his Make America Great Again movement. For Republicans, including incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, it's a Trump loyalty test. The clash has also been a welcome distraction from recent questions about Paxton's private life. Trump, meanwhile, had his eyes on the U.S. House when he openly prodded Texas Republicans this summer to give him five more GOP seats in a state he won handily last year. Texas Democrats walked out for two weeks, denying Republicans the quorum they needed. They ended the walkout this week, but only after California Gov. These people are thugs,” O'Rourke said in an interview with The Associated Press. “Giving in or seeking compromise, or trying to make concessions in the hopes that they'll stop pursuing you, that stuff clearly does not work. He asked courts to expel the lawmakers who walked out, brought lawsuits to declare their seats vacant and sought to jail O'Rourke, arguably the state's most well-known Democrat, accusing him of illegally raising money to help defray costs for the Democratic lawmakers who left. “We are pursuing every legal remedy at our disposal to hold these rogue legislators accountable,” Paxton said in a statement. “Texas deserves representatives who do their jobs instead of running away at the behest of their billionaire handlers.” After first criticizing Paxton for being on vacation in Europe when the redistricting drama began, Cornyn used the moment to question Paxton's tactics. “It seems like both are doing what each of them can do, given their own public office,” said Roy Bailey, a wealthy Republican donor from Dallas. Cornyn's campaign and groups that support him, including a pro-Cornyn super PAC and the Washington-based Senate Leadership Fund, have spent more than $7.5 million in advertising since July, mainly criticizing Paxton. “At a time that so many who have the power to fight are instead bending the knee to Donald Trump,” he said, “the country really needed to see someone stand and fight.” The redistricting drama has also inspired Allred, a former congressman and voting rights attorney who launched his bid for the Democratic nomination last month, to travel for a series of town halls on redistricting. He said a pastor in a Black church in Dallas compared the situation to a bully only being able to take it so far before victims start fighting back. “If this had passed as quickly as it looked like it was going to, I think many folks wouldn't have known what was happening,” Allred said after a Houston town hall. “There certainly wouldn't have been the national attention on what's happening here in Texas, but that attention has built and built, and the awareness has also built and built, and so this means to me that ultimately there also will be a backlash against these folks who are trying to rig the elections.” He was among those who packed their bags and headed to Chicago. Talarico has appeared on network television and last month was interviewed by conservative podcaster Joe Rogan. Talarico's social media following has expanded to more than 1 million on Instagram and TikTok. O'Rourke had high praise for Talarico but said the young lawmaker's plans wouldn't affect his decision. “I think this is one of those moments where Democratic voters are looking at who's fighting and who's folding. And that to me is the primary dividing line in our party right now,” Talarico told the AP. In his sermon Sunday at Obama's old church in Chicago, Talarico referred to himself as one of the “Texas outlaws” who walked out, prompting loud cheers and applause. “This is not just a political struggle,” he told them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Melania Trump hadn't been spotted at the White House for more than a month. But as her husband prepared for a high-stakes Alaska summit with his Russian counterpart in pursuit of an end to the war in Ukraine, the first lady was practicing diplomacy. “Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation's rustic countryside or a magnificent city-center. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.” It underscored, those who know and observe the first lady say, the understated but influential role she has played in Donald Trump's second term as president, despite her physical absence from Washington. She did not accompany her husband when he delivered her letter to President Vladimir Putin during last week's summit in Anchorage, nor was she present at the White House days later when he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other European leaders. But Trump is in frequent communication with her husband, often in texts or calls exchanged throughout the day, according to sources familiar with the matter. And much like her husband, the first lady consumes a steady diet of news coverage. Another city was just hit,'” Donald Trump recounted during a July Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. … He listens to her and seeks her counsel,” said a source familiar with the dynamic who requested anonymity to speak freely. Melania Trump's office did not respond to multiple inquiries from CNN. She did not specifically name Ukraine, but thousands of Ukrainian children have allegedly been abducted by Russia since the war began. While the president's recent comments about his wife's strong reactions to watching the war unfold on TV have sparked criticism from Russian state media, they've also spawned appreciative “Agent Melania Trumpenko” memes in Ukraine. Melania Trump hasn't stated any public position on Ukraine or Gaza, but her reactions – as described by the president – have offered a kind of reality check on the wars that he has promised, but has so far failed, to end. “She thinks it's terrible,” Donald Trump said last month of the images coming out of Gaza, which Israeli Prime Minister Bejamin Netanyahu has denied showed starvation. And I think everybody, unless they're pretty cold-hearted — or worse than that, nuts — there's nothing you can say other than it's terrible when you see the kids.” Melania Trump also approached her Putin letter from her unique background: she was born in what was then communist Yugoslavia in 1970. “She brings another level of credibility having grown up in a Europe under the control of Russian aggression before successfully gaining their country's freedom,” McBride added. And her engagement is not without precedent: McBride noted that Nancy Reagan spoke directly to Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev to seek peace and wrote to his wife on the eve of a key meeting. Jackie Kennedy wrote to Soviet Union Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev expressing hope for peace after her husband's death. … I applaud Mrs. Trump for using her platform this way on things that are important – especially in this critical moment in world history,” McBride said. Issues related to children have also motivated Trump's limited involvement in domestic policy — from advocating for legislation against deepfake and revenge pornography to a $25 million investment for foster youth that the White House says she secured in the president's budget. That interest has also shaped where she's chosen to embrace the public role of first lady. Last month, for example, she comforted young girls impacted by catastrophic flooding in Texas Hill Country, where she was gifted a friendship bracelet and prayed with campers. “She genuinely does care about tragedy and things that have involved children. I believe in her authenticity when she does participate,” said Kate Bennett, a former CNN journalist who covered the first lady and author of “Free, Melania.” Her last known White House appearance was July 11 as she departed with the president for a trip to Texas. This year, with son Barron in college at New York University, her appearances have been far less regular. She has stood by her husband's side at more than a dozen public events, joined him on a pair of tours after extreme weather damage, and held three solo events. But she's been seen in public less than half of the days she was at this same point in the president's first term, when she'd attended multiple Oval Office meetings and news conferences with world leaders and made trips to seven countries. And she's skipped the kinds of symbolic moments traditionally attended by her predecessors, like a flagpole unveiling and magnolia planting on White House grounds. Her husband has even overseen the renovation of a reimagined, paved Rose Garden, and the West Wing unilaterally announced plans for a $200 million East Wing ballroom expansion that will directly impact the first lady team's office space. In Washington, she employs a skeletal staff compared to her first-term team of approximately 11 staffers. As of July 1, the first lady had five full-time staff members, according to a report sent to Congress, whose salaries totaled $634,200 per year. One key role, the White House social secretary, who plans and coordinates all official and personal social White House events, remains unfilled. A similar report sent July 1, 2024, reflected more than 20 staffers working in first lady Jill Biden's office, with their salaries totaling nearly $2.5 million per year. In a rare interview with Fox News before her husband's return to office, Melania Trump said she didn't want to “rush in” to hiring and wanted to ensure her employees are “serving me,” not their own agenda — perhaps reflecting some apprehension after key staffers resigned in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. That hesitancy could stem from a series of public betrayals by former staffers, including Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former longtime friend and senior adviser who secretly recorded tapes of the first lady and wrote a memoir about their relationship. But without a substantial staff, Trump has yet to lay out any new policy goals or expansion of her first-term “Be Best” campaign. She has not participated in any solo foreign or domestic travel. She has not announced plans for any official state visits to the White House. “When she speaks, people do listen – and whether or not that's because it's so infrequent, I'm unsure, but she definitely has a platform. She should lean into that,” the source familiar said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the facility, the newest officers from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations arm will undergo an eight-week training course covering topics ranging from immigration law to firearms and driving safety before they are sent to a field office to begin working alongside their peers. The Washington Examiner took part in an all-day tour of the 5,400-acre Federal Law Enforcement Training Center on Thursday, accompanied by acting ICE Director Todd Lyons. The center, known as FLETC, is located between Jacksonville, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia. Every year, FLETC hosts 68,000 students from 105 federal law enforcement agencies to be trained on-site, with about 3,000 on campus at any given time. Students who graduate will come back for additional training throughout their careers. Lyons compared FLETC to a college campus where students, despite studying various topics, are together in one setting. Marshals Service live in a single community for several weeks or months as they complete certifications and trainings. When not in class, students can check out paddleboards and kayaks, among other equipment, for recreation. As part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ICE received $29.9 billion for hiring staff, transporting illegal immigrants, and detaining families. Basic training for all incoming ICE recruits is eight weeks long. It used to include an additional five weeks of Spanish language classes, but that was recently rescinded and replaced with a translation service for officers in the field. Depending on the number of arrivals, the site can expand its trainings to two to three shifts per day and have instructors available seven days a week, Vitello said. Lyons and Vitello did not provide an estimate on how long it would take for all 10,000 new recruits to be hired and trained at FLETC. The agency has received 121,000 applications since mid-July, Lyons said Thursday. ICE incentivized the public to apply with offers of hiring bonuses as large as $50,000 and $60,000 in student loan repayment, and also took steps such as removing the age limit and opening the program up to candidates who are not college graduates. ICE is only responsible for enforcing certain federal laws, not state or local ones, such as traffic offenses. Officers are trained in law enforcement regulations, defensive techniques, and how to process immigrants in their custody, carry out at-large operations on the street, and operate firearms. Vitello said the goal for ICE officers who interact with the public is not to use force as they speak with people about their immigration status. To graduate, officers must complete an obstacle course in under 1 minute and 45 seconds, among many other requirements. Inside a nearby training center that will soon be doubled by 40,000 square feet, recruits learn hand-to-hand combat and can access state-of-the-art gym equipment across multiple large rooms. Vitello said one of FLETC's newest priorities is training for mental and physical wellness today and in 20 years, though officials did not provide details on how mental health is being prioritized. ICE's Special Response Team demonstrated how trainees had been taught to descend on a residential home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, has rocketed past his rivals in fundraising, bringing in a little more than $1 million in recent weeks, according to new campaign reports filed Friday. Mamdani's haul far exceeds the $425,000 raised by the city's embattled incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is waging a long-shot independent bid for a second term, and that of former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who raised a little more than $507,000 since relaunching his campaign in July after his bruising primary loss to Mamdani. In one sign of the former governor's financial challenge, Cuomo also opted to transfer more than $68,000 from a state campaign account to help build his coffers for the city contest. The Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa – viewed as a marginal candidate in the deeply Democratic city – raised about $407,000. Mamdani also has built a substantial war chest – with $4.4 million cash on hand, according to Friday's filings with the New York City Campaign Finance Board. His campaign said it also expects to qualify for more than $2 million in public money under the city's public fund matching program. And about half of his money came from donors who live outside the city, the filings show. “With over 50,000 volunteers, thousands of small-dollar donors, and genuine enthusiasm for Zohran's vision for a more affordable New York City, our momentum is surging,” Mamdani's campaign spokesperson Dora Pekec said in a statement Friday. Cuomo, who announced in mid-July that he would continue to mount a general election campaign as a third-party candidate, has about $1.2 million in available cash. His campaign said Friday it is hoping to secure some $525,000 in matching funds. Adams, meanwhile, has a cash balance of roughly $3.9 million but has been repeatedly denied valuable public funds from the New York campaign board, which has cited its ongoing investigation of his campaign's practices. He recently sued the board over its denial. Federal prosecutors last year indicted Adams on corruption charges, which the Trump administration has since dropped. On Friday, Adams insisted he would not abandon his reelection bid, a day after his former chief advisor was accused of accepting thousands of dollars in bribes. Philanthropist Elizabeth Simons, the daughter of late hedge-fund co-founder James Simons, donated $250,000 earlier this month to a pro-Mamdani super PAC, New Yorkers for Lower Costs. Super PACs operate independently of candidates' campaigns. Shortly after winning the Democratic primary in June, Mamdani said he didn't think billionaires should exist. “I don't think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality, and ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country,” Mamdani said on NBC's “Meet the Press” at the time. Meanwhile, recent bold-faced contributors to a super PAC promoting Cuomo's candidacy include billionaire Walmart heir Alice Walton. CNN's David Wright and Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That lawsuit, filed in 2023, detailed multiple instances of students saying Hoffman was not fit for a position serving students of color. Another student allegedly asked Diaz if “white staff” can do as well “within a space for people of color.” Hoffman later felt compelled to resign as a result of the pressure and other staff questioning her “legitimacy,” the complaint says. In a statement to Fox News after the settlement, Hoffman said, although she faced “unlawful discrimination” while serving in her DEI role, she is still “steadfast in my belief that high-quality, accessible education … is essential for all learners.” “I believe deeply in leading and teaching with integrity and in choosing the harder right over the easier wrong. Hoffman's lawyer also said they did not bring the lawsuit as a measure of opposition to DEI or the school's programs, but because the college “unlawfully discriminated against an employee who championed those programs with substantial success.” Specifically, the administration has brought Title VII violations against schools that it believes are using DEI practices in faculty hiring and general student guidance, among other things. The Department of Justice recently announced a civil rights investigation into the University of California, alleging its faculty hiring practices violated civil rights law. The University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire is located in western Wisconsin. It has over 9,000 enrolled students and is predominantly white.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An art installation, which displays black and white images of people detained or deported as a result of ICE raids in Southern California, stands outside the federal building in Los Angeles, Thursday, July 17, 2025. A judge ruled late Friday the Trump administration cannot deny funding to Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles and 30 other cities and counties because of policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration efforts. U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco extended a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from cutting off or conditioning the use of federal funds for so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions. An email to the White House late Friday was not immediately returned. In his ruling, Orrick said the administration had offered no opposition to an extended injunction except to say the first injunction was wrong. Orrick also blocked the administration from imposing immigration-related conditions on two particular grant programs. The Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure on sanctuary communities as it seeks to make good on President Donald Trump's campaign promise to remove millions of people in the country illegally. One executive order issued by Trump directs Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to withhold federal money from sanctuary jurisdictions. The cities and counties that sued said billions of dollars were at risk. Orrick, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said the executive orders and the “executive actions that have parroted them” were an unconstitutional “coercive threat.” In May, the Department of Homeland Security published a list of more than 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions,” saying each one would receive formal notification that the government had deemed them noncompliant. The Justice Department has also sued New York, Los Angeles and other cities over their sanctuary policies. There is no strict definition for sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe places that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide but seeks help from state and local authorities to identify immigrants wanted for deportation and hold them for federal officers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Audrey Strauss, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, points to a photo of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, during a news conference in New York on July 2, 2020. Read what you missed below and find more coverage at apnews.com. The Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of interviews its No. 2 official did with Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend as the Trump administration scrambles to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex-trafficking case. By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping, at least temporarily, to keep at bay sustained anger from President Donald Trump's base even as they continue to sit on other evidence they had suggested was being prepared for public release. U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from cutting off or conditioning the use of federal funds for Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles and 30 other cities and counties. The Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure on those communities as it seeks to make good on Trump's campaign promise to remove millions of people in the country illegally. One executive order issued by Trump directs officials to withhold federal money from sanctuary jurisdictions. The cities and counties that sued said billions of dollars were at risk. Posts claimed that these 55 million visa holders, plus about 25 million or more people living in the country illegally, means that nearly a quarter to a third of the people living in the U.S. are not American citizens. But government data contradicts these figures, and experts say the estimates spreading online are highly inflated. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, who was chief of the Navy Reserve, as well as Rear Adm. Milton Sands, a Navy SEAL officer who oversaw Naval Special Warfare Command. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials confirmed ending union recognition for many employees. The American Federation of Government Employees argues that strong union contracts support a stable workforce, especially in public health emergencies. (At least 25 percent of its students must be Hispanic in order to get the designation.) Justice Department officials argued the program provides an unconstitutional advantage based on race or ethnicity. Trump says he's naming White House personnel director Sergio Gor as ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs. Gor had been tasked with vetting Trump's choices for administration positions, including the president's nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to lead NASA — a bid that was withdrawn in June. With schools set to kick off a new year of classes Monday, D.C. Public Schools issued a message Friday seeking to reassure parents concerned that federal law enforcement or Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers would target schools with large immigrant populations. The statement added that law enforcement action on any school grounds can only take place “with a valid warrant or a court order.” Hundreds of people have been arrested on the streets of Washington, D.C., since President Donald Trump ordered a crackdown on crime in the nation's capital. Some of those people are winding up in the same federal courthouse that was flooded with cases against Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol over four years ago. At least eight cases filed in the district court for the District of Columbia appear to be related to the recent surge in patrols by federal agents and National Guard members, according to an Associated Press review of court records. Many others facing less serious charges are having their cases heard daily in D.C. Superior Court. “I don't think we've really felt the brunt of it yet, but I expect it to hit,” defense attorney Damon Catacalos said Friday as he waited for a client's case to be called by a Superior Court judge. The CBO on Friday issued a new blog post that states tariffs will lower deficits by a combined $4 trillion over the next decade. The latest update is an increase from its last projection in June, that predicted deficits would be reduced by $2.8 trillion over 10 years. Trump said the CBO, which he called “Radical Left Representatives” had “admitted how incredible my Tariff strategy has been.” Its current director is Phillip Swagel, a former Treasury official in Republican President George W. Bush's administration. President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform said Friday that his administration would complete a “major tariff investigation” into furniture imported into the U.S. and will issue a report on its findings within the next 50 days. He said furniture coming from other countries into the U.S. would be tariffed at a rate not yet determined. “Our relationship with the United States is at one of the lowest levels it's been since the end of World War II,” Putin said at an event in Sarov, a closed city about 370 kilometers (230 miles) east of Moscow that has served as a base for Russia's nuclear weapons program since the late 1940s. President Donald Trump holds a photo of himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin during an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. Putin also commended Trump's leadership qualities and said he hoped that the first steps had been taken to ensure the “full-scale restoration” of Russia-U.S. ties. He said that Russian companies were already discussing plans with “American partners” on opportunities for co-operation across the Arctic and in Alaska in areas such as liquified natural gas. The comments come the same day as Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, appeared in a taped interview for NBC's Sunday show “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” saying that there were no plans for a meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy – a proposal that Trump has repeatedly floated to end Russia's three-year invasion of their neighbor. JB Pritzker had a cool reaction Friday to President Donald Trump's suggestion that Chicago might be his next target for a crime crackdown featuring the National Guard like that occurring in Washington, D.C. The Democrat posted “Things People are Begging For” on X, including cheaper groceries and reversing cuts to Medicaid and food aid for low-income families but not “an authoritarian power grab of major cities. Shootings and homicides were down more than 30% in the first half of 2025 compared to the same time last year, and total violent crime dropped by over 22%. FILE - Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, speaks during a hearing on Capitol Hill, Thursday, May 2, 2024, in Washington. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired a general whose agency's initial intelligence assessment of damage to Iranian nuclear sites from U.S. strikes angered President Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the decision and a White House official. Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse will no longer serve as head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. It found that Iran's nuclear program has been set back only a few months by the U.S. strikes, contradicting assertions from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump says Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business. Speaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan — which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China. After her interview, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida where she had been serving a 20-year sentence to a minimum security prison camp in Texas. The Epstein case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer's social connections over the years to prominent figures including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump, who has said his relationship with Epstein ended years before. “The Committee intends to make these records public after thorough review to ensure any victims' identification and child sexual abuse material are redacted,” a spokesperson for Oversight Committee Chair James Comer said. House Democrats seized on the issue and ultimately helped push Comer to subpoena the DOJ for documents along with every living U.S. attorney general as well as Bill and Hillary Clinton. “I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, center, leaves the Putnam County Jail, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Cookeville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Brett Carlsen) Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from jail in Tennessee on Friday so he can rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Although Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. The Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of interviews its No. 2 official did with Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend as the Trump administration scrambles to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex-trafficking case. By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from President Donald Trump's base even as they continue to sit on other evidence they had suggested was being prepared for public release. Trump is filing an appeal after a judge said his executive order targeting a prominent law firm violated the firm's First Amendment rights. Susman Godfrey was one of several law firms targeted by Trump's executive orders, and the firm sued in April. In late June, District Court Judge Loren AliKhan granted summary judgment in Susman Godfrey's favor, noting that noting that by that point every court to have considered a challenge to the law-firm-related orders had found “grave constitutional violations.” The President is also appealing rulings in other cases brought by law firms. National Guard soldiers keep watch at Union Station Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. Acknowledging the change announced earlier Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth tweeted a news story about his order for troops to carry guns and said, “Common Sense.” “We're going to see whether or not they have a meeting,” Trump told reporters. Trump said he had begun making arrangements for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting on Monday soon after concluding White House talks with Zelenskyy and European leaders and speaking by phone with Putin. Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, made clear on Friday that Putin won't sit-down with Zelenskyy until Ukraine agrees to certain concessions. The president said he called earlier this month for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign after reading something written by Arkansas Republican senator. Even when she is being harshly critical of Trump's decisions — publicly stating that his declaration of a federal crime emergency in Washington “makes no sense” — Bowser sometimes seems to structure her statements so as to avoid actually saying Trump's name. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be escalating his attacks on Bowser. In a 2 a.m. Friday social media post, Trump wrote, “Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen, including a complete and total Federal takeover of the City!” Hours later in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters, “Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor for long.” “Trump is once again putting armed military onto the streets of an American city. As a federal district, the local government's powers are broadly delegated to it Congress, leaving local officials few avenues to formally block or protest Trump's plan. City Council Chair Phil Mendelson wrote on social media that he'd discussed “the affects of the so-called crime emergency,” among other topics, with Washington residents at a town hall last night. Putin invaded Ukraine more than three years ago, and Trump has been frustrated by his inability to resolve the war. Referring to the photo, Trump said, “I thought it was a nice picture of him. After Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a pause in providing U.S. visas to commercial truck drivers, the Trump administration says it applies to certain foreign applicants. The State Department said Friday that the pause affects those seeking permission to drive a truck under visas for H-2B temporary nonagricultural workers, E-2 investors in U.S. businesses or EB-3 skilled workers. It said the government is launching a review of the way it screens foreign drivers and that “enhanced vetting” will apply to those who don't now hold valid visas. “Applicants must demonstrate the necessary skills, experience, and English language proficiency required to safely operate these vehicles on America's roads,” the department said. President Donald Trump holds the FIFA World Cup Winners Trophy as FIFA President Gianni Infantino, right, and Vice President JD Vance watch, during an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. Touching the World Cup trophy is an honor usually reserved for countries that win it. But organizers of the 2026 World Cup have made an exception for Trump. FIFA President Gianni Infantino visited the Oval Office on Friday and noted of the trophy, “Only the FIFA presidents, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it because it's for winners only.”Then, he added to Trump, “And, since you are a winner, of course you can as well.” The president did just that, then responded, “It's pretty heavy.” He later called the trophy “a beautiful piece of gold” and joked about keeping it and displaying in the Oval Office — which Trump has redone in a gaudy, gold-hued décor. Trump was subsequently presented with a ticket to next year's World Cup final, which organizers said was the first ticket available for the upcoming tournament. President Donald Trump, from right, speaks as Vice President JD Vance and Richard Grenell, president of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees, listen during an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. Trump usually wears a tie in the Oval Office, as do top aides and other officials who visit. But in an unusual move, not only did Trump not wear a tie but none of the men standing around him did either. It wasn't clear why they wore the unified look. The president suggested that other cities will receive similar treatment to D.C. Trump said people in Chicago are “screaming for us to come.” Vice President JD Vance says it's not the case that the Trump administration is targeting former national security adviser John Bolton because he's a vocal critic of President Donald Trump. He said the inquiry centers in part on classified documents as well as what he said was a “broad concern” about Bolton. He said if no crime is found during the investigation, no prosecution will be brought, but that if a crime is found “Ambassador Bolton will get his day in court.” He said “no, not at all” when asked if Bolton was being pursued because of his criticism of Trump and, that if that were the case, “we would just throw out prosecutions willy-nilly.” ESPN had previously reported that the draw would be held in Las Vegas. The federal investigation follows a complaint by multiple professors accusing the university of favoring faculty candidates based on diversity considerations rather than their credentials. President Trump's announcement Friday that he would seek $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington D.C. will likely be received with ironic eyerolls from the local government. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the D.C. Council have spent most of 2025 (prior to the current federal takeover crisis) dealing with an artificial budget crisis created by this Congress. An obscure change in a federal government funding bill forced the district's government to revert to its 2024 budget parameters, effectively cutting $1.1 billion from its previously balanced budget midway through the financial year. Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks with media during a news conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Wednesday, July 30, 2025. Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, a government official familiar with the matter said Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly ahead of the expected announcement by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. “We're doing some very detailed renovations, fixing things are broken. “We'll be doing the Lincoln Bathroom which was Art Deco.” He said of the project, “We're making it actually incredible.” Trump has already made extensive changes to the White House, including installing patio seating around the Rose Garden and promising to build a ballroom. “We're going to be raising about $2 billion from Congress,” the president told reporters. President Donald Trump speaks at The People's House museum, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. The president, for a while, has been covering bruising on the back of his hand with makeup that doesn't match his skin tone. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Trump's hand bruising is “consistent” with irritation from his “frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin.” Florida Sen. Joe Gruters watches during a legislative session April 30, 2021, at the Capitol in Tallahassee, Fla. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File) Republican National Committee members elected Gruters on Friday at their summer meeting in Georgia. President, thank you for your faith in me,” Gruters said after the vote. Gruters is a Florida state lawmaker and former state party chairman who was a Trump ally even before the billionaire real estate and marketing mogul first ran for president. Gruters succeeds Michael Whatley, who stepped down to run for U.S. Senate in North Carolina. Republicans hope new maps pushed by President Trump will produce five new GOP seats in a bid to hold their slim majority in the U.S. House. Texas' gerrymandering effort has triggered a ripple effect across several states. President Donald Trump speaks with members of law enforcement and National Guard soldiers, Thursday, Aug. 21, 2025, in Washington. And it comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, with the arrival this week of hundreds of troops from several Republican-led states. The Pentagon and Army said last week that troops would not carry weapons.</p>
