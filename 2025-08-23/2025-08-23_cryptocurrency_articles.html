                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XRP advanced sharply during the Aug. 22–23 session, testing multi-month resistance near $3.10 after weeks of sideways trading. The move coincided with dovish commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole, which reinforced expectations of a September rate cut and lifted risk sentiment across digital assets. On-chain settlement volumes on the XRP Ledger surged 500% earlier this week, adding to optimism around institutional adoption despite ongoing whale distribution. • Breakout levels: $2.84–$2.97 accumulation zone triggered upside impulse on high volume.• Resistance: Strong supply pressure emerged at $3.08–$3.10, rejecting further advance.• Support: New floor forming at $2.97–$3.00 psychological level, repeatedly defended intraday.• Volume: Breakout candle logged 667.4 million trades, 72% above weekly average.• Structure: Pattern resembles continuation setup if $3.00 holds, though fading volume late in the session suggests consolidation before next leg. • Whether $3.00 support holds during profit-taking, or if a deeper retrace tests $2.95.• Breakout confirmation above $3.08–$3.10 zone, which could open the path toward $3.25.• Fed policy signals ahead of the September meeting, and impact on risk asset flows.• On-chain activity, which has surged to 844 million tokens settled in a single day, signaling enterprise adoption potential.• Whale flows, as recent exchange deposits continue to weigh on intraday momentum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- Institutional backing from Coinbase Ventures and Sequoia China validates the integration, despite a 16% token price drop and 32% trading volume surge. - Long-term success hinges on regulatory clarity, mainnet development, and real-world use cases from the hackathon to establish Pi as a utility asset. - The move positions Pi as a high-risk/high-reward play in AI-blockchain convergence, with potential governance value if ecosystems scale effectively. In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain and artificial intelligence, Pi Network's $20 million investment in OpenMind AGI represents a pivotal moment. This move transcends traditional cryptocurrency narratives, positioning Pi as a bridge between decentralized finance (DeFi) and the nascent field of artificial general intelligence (AGI). For investors, the question is no longer whether AI and blockchain can coexist—it's how their integration will redefine value creation in the digital age. However, the recent partnership with OpenMind AGI signals a strategic pivot toward real-world utility. OpenMind's OM1 operating system—a decentralized AI platform for robots—aligns with Pi's vision of expanding blockchain beyond payments. By embedding blockchain as a trust layer for machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions, Pi is addressing a critical gap in AGI development: secure, scalable coordination. Blockchain enables microtransactions between autonomous systems, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where AI-driven robots can trade services, data, or compute power. Pi's simultaneous launch of the Philippine Hackathon 2025 underscores its commitment to developer-driven innovation. By offering 160,000 Pi tokens (valued at $48,000) to incentivize applications leveraging AI and blockchain, Pi is fostering a community of builders. The hackathon's focus on sectors like healthcare and logistics highlights the potential for tangible use cases—such as AI-powered diagnostic tools or autonomous supply chain management. If developers create scalable solutions, Pi's token could gain intrinsic value as a medium of exchange within these ecosystems. The immediate 16% drop in Pi's token price post-announcement reflects market skepticism, a common reaction to high-risk, high-reward bets. However, increased trading volume (up 32% to $46.65 million) suggests growing interest. Institutional backing from Coinbase Ventures, Sequoia China, and Pantera Capital adds credibility, signaling that OpenMind's vision aligns with broader industry trends. For context, Ethereum's recent $2.3 billion ETF inflows and Cardano's whale accumulation indicate a sector-wide shift toward AI-integrated blockchain projects. Pi's strategic pivot mirrors this trend, leveraging institutional capital to de-risk its AGI ambitions. Ecosystem Viability: The Philippine Hackathon's output will determine whether Pi's tools translate into real-world value. Pi Network's bet on OpenMind AGI is a speculative but strategically sound move. While short-term volatility is inevitable, the long-term upside lies in its ability to capture a share of the AI-blockchain convergence. Recommendation: Investors should monitor the Philippine Hackathon's mid-checkpoint (September 19, 2025) for early signals of developer traction. Additionally, tracking Ethereum's ETF inflows () could provide context for broader market sentiment. In conclusion, Pi's $20 million investment is not just a financial commitment—it's a declaration of intent to redefine the boundaries of blockchain and AI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wedson suggested that Ethereum is likely entering a reaccumulation phase, with algorithmic trading expected to cluster around the $7,000–$7,500 range. Current data, he argued, suggests that this historical rhythm could repeat, bringing renewed liquidity into Ethereum. A key signal backing this view is Ethereum's open interest, which has surged to levels comparable with Bitcoin. “The good news is that high volatility creates numerous opportunities,” he explained. “The bad news is that such moments of euphoria usually don't last long.” Wedson emphasized that Ethereum currently exhibits a more resilient structure than Bitcoin, but he tempered optimism with caution. Until then, Ethereum's path may be defined by both strong upward moves and sharp corrective phases, as the asset navigates this transitional stage of the cycle. XRP is back in the spotlight as traders eye a potential rally that could more than double its current value. Bitcoin and Ethereum posted major upward moves this week, sparking renewed optimism across the crypto market. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project that has drawn attention for its reported links to the Trump family, is preparing for a key milestone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During this altcoin season, XRP is experiencing strong price growth and a resurgence of institutional confidence. It hit a new ATH in July after 7 years, which shows institutional investors' interest growth. It can be one of the fastest growth trajectories on the market, and XRPL brought institutional interest from major firms like Amber Group. Positioned as the first advanced DEX on XRPL, the DeXRP team is developing a bridge for institutional investors, ordinary traders and DeFi platforms by combining a hybrid model of AMM pools and order book functionality. With its presale already raising over $5 million from more than 7,500 unique wallets, DeXRP is shaping up to become a cornerstone of XRP-powered DeFi. The DeXRP team is focused now on strategic partnerships with top performing XRPL DeFi platforms and on-chain ecosystem. They have become an official sponsor of the WOW Summit in Hong Kong and announced about cooperation with WOW Earn and Micro3. Users can purchase $DXP tokens via Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, XRP Ledger, Bitcoin, or via USDT on supported networks, as well as through bank card transactions. To reward early investors, the DeXRP Team plans to implement Liquidity mining multipliers, enhanced yield multipliers, unique access to premium trading pairs, an Airdrop and Voting system for new pairs and platform updates. Optimized Liquidity Aggregation - DeXRP integrates both automated market maker (AMM) pools and professional order book systems, creating a hybrid liquidity layer. Hybrid Trading Options - Unlike most DEX platforms that force users into AMM-only models, DeXRP allows users to choose between instant AMM swaps or an advanced order book interface.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Creators of an Ethereum Gaming Network Just Sued Elon Musk's xAI The creators of Xai, a layer-3 gaming blockchain built on Ethereum, have sued Elon Musk's xAI for trademark infringement—and are asking a federal court to force the billionaire's artificial intelligence company to change its name and branding in contexts related to video games and blockchain. It also requested punitive damages and all profits reaped by Musk's companies for the alleged infringement. Ex Populus' attorneys repeatedly argued in their complaint that Musk's company has not only consistently infringed on their copyright since last year—but, further, that the particular notoriety and controversy associated with the world's richest man have made the alleged infringement particularly damaging to their brand. Ex Populus took legal action today to protect the Xai brand. The lawyers made particular note of a controversy that erupted last month when Musk's AI bot, Grok, referred to itself as “MechaHitler” for a brief period and made antisemitic, racist, and sexually violent comments across the X platform. Ex Populus said in a statement that Musk's attorneys reached out to them recently about trademark issues, and that, now, the company feels it has no option but to fight back “or risk losing [the trademark] altogether.” “This case isn't just about Ex Populus or Xai,” the company said. Musk's xAI did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment on this story. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

Most major cryptocurrencies are being bought by treasury companies now. Strategy (MSTR 6.10%), formerly known as MicroStrategy, has such an idea. In a nutshell, it issues new debt and new equity to raise capital for huge purchases of Bitcoin (BTC -1.42%), which it aims to hold for the long term, making it the first and largest "crypto treasury" company. Its shares are up by 173% in the last 12 months alone, exceeding Bitcoin's gain of 99%. Other businesses have copied Strategy's approach, and some are even doing it with Ethereum (ETH -1.43%). That's why companies beyond Strategy have adopted Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset, including Semler Scientific, which formalized a Bitcoin treasury approach in 2024 and continues to telegraph its accumulation targets through 2025. But their long-term growth prospects are quite different, because ultimately, they vary depending on the chosen asset. The investment thesis for Ethereum has more to do with its utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) than with its scarcity, which is a far more relevant factor in the investment thesis for Bitcoin. These two coins could and probably will both perform well, but there isn't much reason to expect that they will perform equally. For investors, the proposition is that buying stocks in crypto treasuries is similar to owning the underlying coin, but with leverage created by choices like whether the company uses convertible bonds, equity raises, or other forms of financing. There's also some overhead associated with buying a crypto treasury instead of the underlying asset: The companies have expenses, as well as some added risk brought on by the organizational and governance factors that are inherent in a public company. Of course, when the coin falls, shareholder dilution or debt can bite hard, and debt is generally something that needs to be managed carefully and proactively. So, if the market now tolerates a swath of different reserve assets for crypto treasuries, the door is open for XRP-only versions to emerge -- and they are. A few companies have begun accumulating XRP for their balance sheets. VivoPower announced in late May what it described as an XRP-focused crypto treasury strategy alongside a $121 million private placement, with intent to buy and hold XRP and build its internal DeFi capabilities. In July, Nature's Miracle Holding established an XRP treasury program worth $20 million, funded via a registered equity facility. Assuming that more dedicated XRP treasuries are initiated, investors will face the same trade-offs as described above. It might outperform in a steep XRP bull run, but it can also underperform badly if management issues stock into strength, borrows at the wrong time, or executes the plan badly. Buying the coin directly gets you the potential upside if crypto treasury demand leads to durable buying, but you will also avoid the risks that come with a small public company's balance sheet decisions. Own the asset you actually want to own, not an IOU from something else that owns it, and only add the leverage and management risk if you truly mean to.

Quantum computing is an evolution of classical computing, capable of solving problems that are competitive enough to break the existing cryptographic primitives upon which current blockchain systems are based. Many current approaches focus on isolated aspects of the blockchain, such as cryptographic primitives or key exchange, without a comprehensive strategy that can guarantee end-to-end security in the face of a quantum threat. Finally, traditional consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, centralization, and leader-selection bias. When the adversary has access to a quantum computer, these issues become significantly worse. In this paper, we present QuantumShield-BC, a modular blockchain framework incorporating post-quantum cryptographic signatures, quantum key distribution (QKD), and a novel Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus mechanism driven by quantum random number generation (QRNG) to address these challenges. QKD: The system supports tamper-proof key exchange, quantum-resilient consensus among validator nodes, and secure transaction signing. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that QuantumShield-BC achieves low consensus latency and high throughput, while providing perfect security against simulated attacks from Shor's and Grover's algorithms. The proposed framework eradicates the Sybil attack effectiveness up to 0%, eliminates replay and MITM vulnerabilities, and achieves an average throughput of over 7,000 transactions per second with 100 validators, orders of magnitude better than classical blockchain systems. The importance of each quantum part to the system's robustness is also demonstrated using an ablation study. With its unique ability to provide a post-quantum framework for high-assurance, general-purpose, scalable, and interoperable blockchain networks resistant to quantum-inspired attacks or quantum retrieval, QuantumShield-BC is practical for deployment in critical infrastructure and digital trust ecosystems where performance and a future-proof foundation are essential. Quantum computers are advancing rapidly, posing one of the most significant threats to traditional cryptographic systems, which underpin the security of nearly all blockchains. Secure algorithms like RSA, ECDSA, and SHA-256 are at risk of quantum attacks using Shor's and Grover's algorithms in polynomial time. With the increasing adoption of blockchain in financial systems, healthcare, supply chains, and decentralized identity, researchers must also focus more on blockchain's inherent resilience to quantum-enabled attacks. Concerning quantum adversarial models, classical blockchains (even those augmented with modern cryptographic optimizations) cannot provide the same level of security. Various researchers have explored some standard components of individual enhancement in post-quantum cryptography (PQC), quantum key distribution (QKD), and Blockchain technology enhancements. Carames and Lamas1 studied PQC schemes for blockchain; Gao et al. Quantum blockchain models presented by2 are based on the entanglement and DPoS mechanisms. Bhavin et al. Introduction of a hybrid model based on quantum blind signatures for security in healthcare3. This paper proposes a comprehensive blockchain framework, QuantumShield-BC, that fills these crucial blanks. This research aims to design, implement, and evaluate a post-quantum secure blockchain architecture comprising three critical components: post-quantum digital signatures for transaction signing and verification, QKD to provide secure peer-to-peer communication between all nodes of the network, and a new Q-BFT consensus mechanism based on QRNG to protect against malicious nodes. It is a scalable system that aims to counter key compromise, Sybil, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The main contributions of this work are that (i) it integrates PQC, QKD, and QRNG in an end-to-end manner in a single blockchain protocol, (ii) it minimizes trust in random numbers via QRNG-based consensus and leader election that achieves strong security for random numbers, and (iii) it fosters the gradual introduction of PQC by modular, layered architecture that allows any underlying blockchains to be converted to post-quantum blockchain systems incrementally. A comprehensive evaluation based on extensive simulation is also conducted, reinforcing the research contributions by quantifying the system's underpinning against quantum attacks, performance benchmarking, and ablation studies. 2 reviews the related literature on quantum-safe blockchain technologies, highlighting recent advancements and identifying research gaps.

The leveraging of QRNG for both leader selection and validator authentication (post-quantum) enables its consensus layer—Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT)— to become inherently resistant to Sybil and predictability attacks. Furthermore, employing post-quantum threshold cryptography has also been suggested to achieve stronger multi-party privacy in blockchain consensus settings83, a direction that aligns with the quantum-secure multiparty computation used in our Q-BFT protocol. This paper proposes a QuantumShield-BC framework to provide end-to-end protection for blockchain systems in the quantum age. It incorporates post-quantum digital signatures at the protocol layer, quantum key distribution (QKD) at the network layer, and a Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus mechanism based on quantum random number generation (QRNG) to provide end-to-end quantum attack resistance, scalability, fairness, and high transaction throughput. One of the challenges it poses for blockchain technology is that quantum computing has a disruptive capability concerning the cryptographic techniques we use, primarily traditional cryptographic methods such as RSA and ECC. However, the main disadvantage of all these classical methods is their vulnerability once large-scale quantum computers become available and can perform quantum attacks, such as Shor's algorithm, which efficiently breaks widely used public-key encryption schemes. It has led to the need for quantum-resistant blockchain architectures that ensure the security and safety of these decentralized methodologies against any future threats. Abstract: QuantumShield-BC is a quantum-secured blockchain framework that combines post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD) to provide real-time security and resilience against quantum attacks over the long term. The growing reliance on blockchain technologies for secure transactions, digital identity management, and decentralized applications (DApps) further underscores the necessity of quantum-resistant mechanisms as timelines for such attacks get shorter. However, this dependence on classical encryption introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in existing blockchain security models, as classical encryption can be solved in polynomial time with the aid of quantum computers. QuantumShield-BC addresses this issue by utilizing lattice-based post-quantum digital signatures that can be seamlessly integrated into smart contracts, thereby significantly lowering the barrier to usage on existing protocols while ensuring signature security, even in a quantum adversarial setting. Moreover, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is implemented by creating a secure peer-to-peer communication channel to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Deterministic PRNGs pose a significant attack vector for classical blockchains, as they often lead to nonce prediction in digital signatures, which attackers can exploit. QuantumShield-BC further introduces quantum random number generation (QRNG), providing cryptographically secure random values for generating transaction hashes and executing smart contracts, as well as for the consensus mechanism, significantly augmenting entropy and security. This introduces random deviation, thereby strengthening the protection of classical cryptography against more predictable attacks. System architecture of QuantumShield-BC with PQC, QKD, QRNG, and Q-BFT integration for secure blockchain operations. 1, in addition to securing each transaction, QuantumShield-BC replaces standard proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-work (PoW) models with a Quantum-enhanced Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus layer, bringing the same transactional protection to consensus mechanisms. By ensuring that validator nodes use post-quantum cryptographic authentication, adversaries cannot forge post-quantum authentication signatures or influence the consensus mechanism. The framework incorporates post-quantum secure multi-party computation (MPC) to preserve the resistance of node selection and block validation against classical and quantum-based cyber attacks. By fusing classical cryptography robustness with quantum-safe innovations, QuantumShield-BC embodies a transformation in the landscape of blockchain security. The framework combines encryption with lattice-based digital signatures, QKD-secured communication, QRNG-enhanced randomness, and a quantum-resistant consensus protocol to create a next-generation, tamper-proof blockchain ecosystem. With the continued evolution of quantum technology, the fundamental need for a quantum-secured, decentralized system is heightened. In an era where quantum adversaries pose a potential risk, QuantumShield-BC provides the ideal future-proof solution, safeguarding the integrity of blockchain applications across multiple domains. Workflow diagram of QuantumShield-BC depicting end-to-end transaction processing with PQC-based signing, QKD communication, QRNG-driven leader selection, and Q-BFT consensus. The workflow diagram of QuantumShield-BC, shown in Fig. 2, illustrates the complete lifecycle of a blockchain transaction secured against quantum threats. It begins with a user-initiated transaction digitally signed using post-quantum cryptography. The transaction is then securely transmitted across blockchain nodes using quantum key distribution (QKD). Validators authenticate the transaction using lattice-based signatures, followed by QRNG-based leader selection to ensure unbiased consensus initiation. Table 1 presents the key notations used throughout the QuantumShield-BC framework, defining symbols related to transactions, cryptographic operations, consensus mechanisms, quantum processes, and validator interactions in blockchain. The QuantumShield-BC builds a quantum-safe layer on top of the BC, protecting it from quantum adversaries across all three layers (transaction validation, block generation, and ledger) using PQ cryptographic methods. This layer provides the option to replace traditional cryptographic primitives with post-quantum digital signatures and merge quantum-safe hash functions, aided by quantum random number generation (QRNG) to increase entropy in the blockchain. These changes further bolster the blockchain against key stealing, signature forgery, and entropy-based attacks that may become possible with the emergence of quantum CPUs. Digital signatures are crucial in verifying the authenticity of a transaction and preventing third-party manipulation. Unlike classical cryptographic schemes like RSA or ECDSA, which rely on Shor's algorithm, QuantumShield-BC adopts a cryptographic stance when it comes to signing and verifying transactions, utilizing PQC algorithms such as CRYSTALS-Dilithium or Falcon post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) technology. The function for transaction verification is defined by The security of the blockchain relies on more secure block generators, which allow data integrity to be secured while still maintaining immutability. QuantumShield-BC: Each block in QuantumShield-BC is tied to the previous one using a quantum-resistant hashing function. The hash of a block can be computed using a post-quantum secure hash function, such as SPHINCS + or Keccak, providing resistance to Grover's search algorithm. To mitigate this, QuantumShield-BC leverages quantum random number generation (QRNG) to introduce high-entropy randomness in cryptographic operations, such as block generation and nonce generation in smart contracts. This feature guarantees that roll results are at random, free from the weak state seeds. QuantumShield-BC also interfaces to a quantum-resistant Merkle tree for secure ledger storage. It is interesting to note that classic Merkle trees are based on hash-based proof of eligibility and could not be trusted alone in the presence of a quantum attack. The approach replaces traditional construction with a post-quantum Merkle tree where each node is signed through a lattice-based DS. The Merkle root calculation is given by By combining post-quantum signatures at every node layer, the transaction integrity is preserved against quantum adversaries. QuantumHyperledger/QuantumShield-BC distinguishes itself as a tamper-resistant and robust decentralized ledger via the QRL by combining post-quantum digital signatures, hash hardening algorithms, and QRNG-based entropy. These improvements keep the blockchain operational and resilient to quantum-computing attack vectors as they emerge, meaning that QuantumShield-BC is the future of decentralized, secure applications. QuantumShield-BC enhances blockchain security by utilizing Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure peer-to-peer communication, thereby protecting the cryptographic keys exchanged between blockchain nodes against quantum attacks. Figure 3 illustrates that classic key-exchange mechanisms in cryptography, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman, lack security against Shor's algorithm in traditional blockchain networks. QKD, on the other hand, can provide the generation and secure transmission of cryptographic keys based on quantum states, for which eavesdropping and key compromise are not feasible. Quantum key distribution (QKD) process flow illustrating secure key exchange between blockchain nodes using quantum states and classical reconciliation. Protected by the no-cloning theorem and superposition in quantum mechanics, 7 QKD allows for an intercept-resilient exchange of cryptographic keys. QuantumShield-BC utilizes the BB84 protocol to exchange a key between the sender and receiver blockchain nodes via quantum state-encoded, polarized photons. The key exchange can then be mathematically described. After the Quantum Key is exchanged successfully, it is applied to build a safe symmetric encryption channel between blockchain nodes. By encrypting, the transmitted blockchain data is kept private and secure. Here \(\:{D}_{K}\left(C\right)\) is the cryptographic decryption operation. QKD provides the guarantee of key confidentiality, and post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEM), such as Kyber and FrodoKEM, are applied to achieve hybrid security for blockchain data exchange. The hybrid encryption, combining QKD and lattice-based encryption, aims to protect against vulnerabilities in one security layer by ensuring the other remains secure. Denote the hybrid key agreement function by where \(\:{K}_{H}\) is the hybrid secret key for secure communication, \(\:{K}_{QKD}\) is the secret key generated from qa quantum source, and cap K sub cap P cap Q cap C is the key from a post-quantumkey encapsulation mechanism. QKD-authentication based mechanisms also add a layer of security to blockchain communications. Validator nodes in the blockchain network are authenticated by quantum-secure key exchange method and can defend against Sybil and identity cues attacks. A key QKD-authenticated identity hash is generated in each validator node, as follows: This allows consensus and block validation only by nodes that are quantum-authenticated. By using QKD for secure key exchange, QuantumShield-BC Se mitigates the risks associated with classical key exchange protocols and adds layer of post-quantum encryption. QKD is integrated with hybrid encryption schemes and QKD-authenticated node validation to secure the blockchain against classical and quantum attack fronts. With this, QuantumShield-BC establishes a channel for communication that will remain for the decentralized networks of the blockchain's future. Theoretically unbreakable, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) provides secure key exchange; however, practical implementations raise several issues. The significant challenges include the high hardware costs of quantum photon sources, detectors, and synchronization systems, as well as channel loss over long distances, particularly when the channel is a fiber-optic or free-space link. QuantumShield-BC addresses these concerns, supporting a modular integration that allows hybrid PQC-KEM mechanisms to supplement QKD in situations where its deployment is not feasible. Future improvements will investigate satellite-based QKD or trusted node relays to eliminate losses caused by distance and increase the practical applicability of the system. Introducing a quantum-secure consensus, QuantumShield-BC enhances the security of the blockchain by utilizing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), as illustrated in Fig. Classic consensus schemes, such as PoW and PoS, are based on cryptographic algorithms that are susceptible to quantum attacks (e.g., Shor's algorithm, which can crack RSA and ECC). It is ensured that the proposed Q-BFT-based protocol is secure for block validation and transaction verification even in the quantum environment. Quantum byzantine fault tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus flowchart showing validator authentication, QRNG-based leader selection, and multi-party consensus execution. In QuantumShield-BC, each validator node is required to verify transactions with a post-quantum cryptographic signature before contributing to the consensus. The authentication is formed using lattice-based digital signatures, so malicious parties cannot forge the validator credentials. This prevents the Byzantine Army from joining the consensus by only accepting quantum-resistant signatures to verify a block. This consensus decision function collects multiple signatures of validator nodes, and the block is appended to the blockchain only if a large enough set of quantum-authenticated validators accept it. Where \(\:{C}_{V}\) is the consensus declared voting result, \(\:{T}_{i}\) is any individual transaction of a block, and \(\:{P}_{i}\) is the post-quantum public key of the validator \(\:\:i\). QiatumShield-BC can defend against attacks such as quantum Sybil attacks and signature forging by implementing this quantum-secure aggregation process. QuantumShield-BC uses quantum-resistant threshold cryptography to guarantee that block finalization is not possible unless a sufficiently large number of validators participate. The block confirmation horizon can be derived as follows: Where \(\:{Q}_{C}\) is a quantum consensus threshold, \(\:{V}_{{node}_{i}}\) is the verification status of single validator nodes, and \(\:\tau\:\) is a minimum threshold required for consensus. This maintains decentralization in the blockchain and thwart quantum bloc adversaries attempts to effect block finalization. Leader election in consensus protocols is generally susceptible to predictability attacks. QuantumShield-BC addresses this challenge by using QRNG for unbiased leader election. Thanks to the use of QRNG, QuantumShield-BC makes sure leader election mysterious and non-manipulatable. In QuantumShield-BC (QSB)-QRNGs are not augmentations of conventional PRNGs(2), but separated quantum entropy sources based on physical behavior of quantum systems. QRNGs, however, take their source of randomness from fundamentally unpredictable quantum processes (such as photon phase noise, radioactive decay, or vacuum fluctuations), in contrast to PRNGs, which rely on deterministic algorithms and seed value(s). Such sources are physically uncloneable and therefore they cannot be mimicked so that they not only quantum mechanically sounds more secure than classical random numbers, but they are not just probabilistically secure (cloning the classical data is a typical classical attack), but they are also physically verifiable. To avoid being attacked by entropy predictability, QuantumShield-BC employs QRNG generated values for leader selection, nonce generation and consensus randomness. Randomness is fed through quantum-proof extractors (such as Trevisan's extractor) for entropy extraction and uniformity, making the output cryptographically usable (see20 for specifics on the entropy extraction process). For additional security, the architecture includes a hybrid consensus validation scheme with the quantum multiparty computation (QMPC). This way, several validators can cooperate in validating transactions and without revealing too much about the sensitive cryptographical information. The centralized verification process over multi-party consensus is defined as QuantumShield-BC achieves privacy preserving and quantum-safe consensus validation by using QMPC. By combining QRPoA with PQC-threshold signature, QRNG leader selection, and QMPC consensus validation, QuantumShield-BC is secure against classical and quantum adversarial attacks. This method allows decentralized blockchain systems to achieve the tamper-proof and security in the quantum scale era because of large-scale quantum computer, and it makes QuantumShield-BC as a future next-generation blockchain consensus framework. The development of the quantumshield-bc prototype takes place in several stages to enable a step-by-step integration of quantum-safe blockchain components. In addition to a post-quantum cryptography (PQC), the OmegaLedger prototype includes quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum-secure consensus algorithms, and quantum random number generation (QRNG) as solutions to boost blockchain immunity against quantum attacks. At each stage, critical security concerns, that is transaction verification, block creation, consensus assurance, and secure p2p communication, are addressed. The first phase of development focuses on incorporating post-quantum digital signatures to transition from classical signatures, RSA and ECC, to post-quantum. This prevents non quantum-resistant signatures from being added to the blockchain. In the second stage, the communication between nodes are being insured using QKD, where nodes use QKD to share an encrypting/decrypting key for the block chain communication. This also closes weaknesses in traditional key exchange schemes like Diffie-Hellman and RSA. The pairwise key agreement between nodes is specified as: If the key is intercepted by an enemy, he will change the quantum state; therefore, key compromise will be noticed immediately. To derive tamper-proof block generation, QuantumShield-BC employs quantum-resistant hashing for connecting the blocks together within the blockchain. The block hash calculation uses SPHINCS + or Keccak, which are resistant to Grover algorithm attacks. The hash function used to create a block is defined as: This ensures that the data cannot be changed and that it will be resistant to quantum attacks. The upcoming developments will be directed towards the implementation of Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT), a post-quantum consensus protocol that supersedes old-fashioned PoS and PoW mechanisms. It was also observed that validator nodes prove their identity with quantum-secure signatures before joining the consensus. Only verified QSC validators are allowed to participate in the consensus. QuantumShield-BC relies on QRNG to achieve fair and tamper-free leader election free from pseudo randomness source such as pseudo-random number generator and pseudo-random counterparts. The last stage comprises the installation of QuantumShield-BC prototype on a testbed for testing its security and performance as well as its defence to quantum attacks. The security of transaction verification, consensus and block generation is proven with quantum attack simulation on quantum computing simulator (i.e., IBM Qiskit or Google Cirq). Where \(\:{M}_{C}\) is the consensus validation status, \(\:{S}_{i}\) is the digital signature of validator post-quantum \(\:i\), and \(\:H\left({T}_{i}\right)\) is the hash cryptographic value of transaction \(\:{T}_{i}\). This multi-party validation prevent any but quantum-secure transactions from entering the blockchain. Incorporating PQ digital signatures, PKI free QKD, quantum-secure hashing, and QRNG-based consensus, the QuantumShield-BC prototype provides an ultra-resilient and temper-proof blockchain platform. By the systematic evolution and incorporation of quantum-safe technology into a blockchain, so that the blockchain is operational, scalable and robust against newly emerging quantum scientific threats, a future user facing quantum-safe blockchain 2.0 can be achieved. Each algorithm addresses a specific component of the system, including transaction authentication, secure key exchange, quantum-safe consensus, and randomness generation. Together, these algorithms ensure end-to-end quantum resilience, enabling secure, scalable, and tamper-proof blockchain operations in the presence of emerging quantum computational threats. Algorithm 1 secures blockchain transactions using post-quantum digital signatures. This ensures that the transaction is authentic, tamper-proof, and resistant to quantum-based attacks. Through classical communication, both parties compare bases and retain matching bits to form a raw key. After error correction and privacy amplification, a final secure key is established, ensuring tamper-proof communication against quantum adversaries. A secure hash function, such as SPHINCS + or Keccak, is then applied to produce a tamper-proof hash. Algorithm 4 performs transaction validation using post-quantum cryptographic techniques. This process ensures that only authentic and quantum-secure transactions enter the blockchain. It begins by producing a sequence of quantum bits, which are measured to obtain raw entropy. A randomness extraction function is then applied to refine the output. The resulting value provides true, unpredictable randomness used for nonce generation, leader selection, and other critical blockchain processes. Algorithm 6 selects a consensus leader using quantum-generated randomness. A random number is generated via a quantum random number generator (QRNG) and mapped to a validator index by taking the modulus with the total number of validators. This approach ensures fair, unpredictable, and tamper-proof leader selection. Quantum byzantine fault tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus algorithm. Algorithm 7 establishes consensus using the Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) mechanism. Each validator verifies transactions using post-quantum signatures and broadcasts its result. The system aggregates validator votes and compares them against a predefined threshold. If the number of valid votes meets or exceeds this threshold, consensus is achieved and the block is approved; otherwise, consensus fails and is retried. Algorithm 8 performs post-quantum multi-party consensus verification among validators. Each validator independently verifies transaction signatures using post-quantum cryptography. The results are securely shared and aggregated using quantum-secure multi-party computation. If all verifications are successful, consensus is confirmed. This ensures tamper-resistant validation across distributed nodes in a quantum-secure blockchain environment. Algorithm 9 finalizes and appends a validated block to the blockchain. It first checks whether consensus has been achieved. If valid, the block data is hashed using a post-quantum secure hash function and linked to the previous block. Algorithm 10 secures validator communication using quantum-aware techniques. It begins by establishing a key via quantum key distribution, followed by validator authentication using post-quantum signatures. All messages are encrypted using the QKD-derived key. The system ensures quantum-resilient, authenticated, and tamper-proof communication across blockchain nodes. The assessment considers transaction validation latency, consensus throughput, cryptographic entropy, and benchmark quantum resistance. These benchmarks guarantee QuantumShield-BC maintains high speed operation and uses post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) primitives, QKD, Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT), and QRNG. The validation time \({T}_{v}\) of a transaction can be defined as Since lattice-based signatures (e.g., CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon) increase the computational overhead as compared to ECC, we strive to choose PQC schemes with the least latency, to achieve the most efficient QuantumShield-BC. Another essential metric to consider is consensus throughput, the number of transactions that can be handled per second and that are secure against quantum adversaries. Utilizing Quantum-Secure Multi-Party Computation (QMPC), the consensus mechanism ensures secure transaction validation, whilst minimizing the computational overhead caused by post-quantum cryptographic primitives. QuantumShield-BC, in selecting specific PQC algorithms, makes a balance between computational efficiency and post-quantum security guarantees. We considered both CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon schemes as digital signatures, both of which are NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization finalists. CRYSTALS-Dilithium provides excellent security guarantees and high confidence in being resilient against lattice-based attacks; however, Falcon supports very small signatures with much faster verification speeds, making it more advantageous for high-throughput blockchain environments. We used Falcon for consensus authentication in our prototype, due to its fast signature verification time (1.5 ms per signature), and we opted for Dilithium for transaction signing, where the signature size constraint is less critical. We found that total conversion to Dilithium increases validation time by 18%, but this also improves resistance to some attacks based on side-channels17. These design choices exemplify how modular PQC algorithm customization can align security-performance trade-offs for real systems. An entropy assessment of QRNG-based blockchain functions is conducted to evaluate the quality of randomness applied to leader selection, nonce generation, and cryptographic key generation tasks. The Shannon entropy formula determines the quantum entropy value, cap R sub cap Qalue, \(\:{R}_{Q}\), is determined by the Shannon entropy formula: Higher entropy values imply better randomness, increased security for cryptographic keys, and greater unpredictability in blockchain operations. Equation (23) computes the Shannon entropy value derived from quantum bitstreams generated by a QRNG device. Unlike classical bitstreams, the probabilities \(\:{p}_{i}\)​ are obtained from quantum state measurement results, ensuring they reflect hardware-derived unpredictability rather than algorithmic randomness. In order to measure the quantum resistance of blockchain transactions, we analyze security by running simulations using Shor's Algorithm to compare the resistance of classical versus post-quantum cryptography. The time complexity for solving the cryptographic key with Shor's algorithm can be expressed as: $ where ta is the time to guess a while Shor's key is around Inf:. Where \(\:N\:indicates\:the\:length\:of\) the cryptographic key in bits, since RSA/ECC keys will be broken in polynomial time by Shor's algorithm, QuantumShield-BC is based on post-quantum cryptographic primitives like Kyber, FrodoKEM, and SPHINCS + that are secure against quantum decryption. Another relevant measure is the network overhead due to QKD-based encryption. However, QKD's secure key distribution may lead to extra bandwidth consumption, where cap O sub cap Q is the overhead factor. Where \(\:{B}_{Q}\) denotes the bandwidth cconsumption of QKD-based encryption, a nd \(\:{B}_{C}\) denotes classical encryption. QuantumShield-BC is lightweight, and the overall communication efficiency is not degraded as QKD key exchange rates are improved and unnecessary quantum-state transmissions are suppressed. This allows QuantumShield-BC to be tested against the following performance measures, namely, transaction validation latency, consensus throughput, entropy test, quantum safety test, QKD-induced network overhead, and block confirmation time, to strike a tradeoff among security, efficiency, and scalability. These results support that the insertion of quantum-safe cryptographic features improves the resilience of blockchain-based networks against quantum threats with negligible performance degradation. QuantumShield-BC provides a unique and functionally integrated quantum-secure blockchain structure which incorporates post-quantum digital signatures, secure communication through QKD, leader election based on QRNG, and a new Q-BFT consensus protocol in a single framework. In contrast to earlier efforts to improve the security of respective quantum individual layer (PQCs only/QKDs only) QuantumShield-BC is a an integrated layered solution with protocol-level modularity, consolidated quantum cryptographic implementations on each layer (transaction, network and consensus layer, respectively) with an extensive use of quantum secure systems inherent across the multiple layers of the infrastructure. By validation, the prototype embodies a tangible performance benefit over 7000 TPS at 100 validators, and full quantum resistance to Sybil, replay, and MITM attacks, verified through detailed ablation studies quantifying the contribution of each quantum component. Most existing blockchain systems rely on the ECDSA, a cryptographic algorithm whose security can be effectively compromised by applying Shor's algorithm. Including lattice-based signature schemes, CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon, makes the framework resistant to compromise through quantum-enabled keys. These post-quantum signatures exhibit computational infeasibility for signature forgery but enable efficient transaction validation, thereby preserving blockchain security against the post-quantum threat. It also features the first-time integration of quantum key distribution (QKD) to achieve safe transport over single-mode fiber-based node-to-node communication by preventing eavesdropping or interception of encryption keys. Quantum computers decrypt public-private key cryptography used in traditional blockchains. Based on quantum mechanics, QKD guarantees that eavesdropping on cryptographic keys disturbs their quantum state, making such efforts detectable. This innovation allows blockchain nodes to securely send encryption keys to each other, creating a quantum-resistant peer-to-peer communication mechanism that cannot be attacked by a man-in-the-middle (MITM). The second main element of innovation of QuantumShield-BC is the Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus mechanism that strengthens the fault tolerance of blockchain validators. Sybil Attack Resistant — Classic consensus protocols like PoW and PoS are sybil attack resistant (if an attacker has the majority of computing power or stake, they can process any valid transaction). Using post-quantum digital signatures and multi-party secure computation, Q-BFT guarantees that only quantum-authenticated validators can form consensus. This ensures that adversaries with quantum capabilities cannot control the network and that trust remains decentralized. An even more fundamental feature of QuantumShield-BC is the application of quantum random number generation (QRNG), which helps with the significant level of unpredictability needed in key cryptographic processes; not just that block generation, nonce selection, and brilliant contract execution are entirely random (all of which can be compromised by classical deterministic PRNGs). Blockchain systems are susceptible to replay attacks and nonce manipulations because classical pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) allow for an entropy prediction attack19. QRNG is based on the quantum mechanical principles of superposition and randomness extraction, offering a genuinely unpredictable entropy source: this guarantees that cryptographic randomness is tamper-evident and immune to deterministic weaknesses intrinsic to all classical PRNGs. In addition to regular blockchain storage, QuantumShield-BC ensures the security of blockchain storage with quantum-resistant hashing techniques, maintaining the characteristics of immutability in the face of quantum attacks. It also means that traditional hashes, like SHA-256, are vulnerable to Grover's algorithm, and using it on hashes doubles the effectiveness of brute-force attacks against traditional cryptographic hashes. To counter this, the framework uses hash-based digital signatures such as SPHINCS + and quantum-resistant hashing algorithms such as Keccak, which are believed to have a high degree of resistance against potential quantum computational speed-ups. This ensures that blockchain ledger data is secure and unalterable by any quantum computer that can currently break conventional hashing functions. QuantumShield-BC addresses this issue by utilizing QRNG for leader selection, resulting in an entirely random and immutable selection of validators. While traditional leader election mechanisms are based on deterministic algorithms, the use of quantum-generated randomness prevents the adversarial influence of private information, ensuring safety and transparency in blockchain governance. In addition, the framework also provides a hybrid cryptographic scheme that merges QKD and post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (PQC-KEM), including Kyber and FrodoKEM17,51. Our hybrid encryption scheme preserves the security of the secondary post-quantum encryption layer even under a compromise of QKD due to implementation-layer issues. Through dual-layer encryption, QuantumShield-BC is more resistant than previous solutions against classical and quantum cyber threats, offering strong security assurances for blockchain transactions and innovative contract executions. One of the additional characteristics of QuantumShield-BC is that it is resilient to quantum-enhanced replay attacks. For instance, classical blockchains use nonce verification to ensure no transaction occurs twice (essentially timestamp-based checks for duplicates), but using the quantum computer to essentially time travel and trigger a validation bypass by the device's incorrect timestamps. By integrating QRNG, it is guaranteed that a truly quantum-generated atom is used to generate the next transaction nonce, making any potential replay of an old transaction impossible. These security measures make blockchain transactions highly secure and enable strong protection against double-spending and duplication attacks, which cannot even be carried forward in a quantum computing environment. QuantumShield-BC is a new kind of quantum-secure blockchain architecture that synergistically integrates these innovations to help make decentralized systems quantum-resistant for years to come. This means that integrating post-quantum cryptography, quantum key distribution, QRNG, and Q-BFT consensus helps to protect against quantum attacks on each part of the blockchain. QuantumShield-BC not only defines a benchmark for secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof blockchain ecosystems but also runs on an out-of-the-box quantum-resilience framework, as opposed to the traditional blockchain systems that will need first-order cryptographic upgrades to maintain their post-quantum securability. To summarize, the key innovation of QuantumShield-BC include integration in single protocol level of post-quantum digital signature, quantum-key-distribution and quantum-random-number generator coupled with a new Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus algorithm. Although prior work tends to analyse such technologies in a loose setting or a restricted manner together, QuantumShield-BC enables a complete modular and end-to-end architecture with scalability and quantum resistance empirical performance validation. The unification of cryptographic, communication and consensus resilience into a single deployable blockchain framework is the central contribution of our work. QuantumShield-BC is analysed in our security benchmarking against post-quantum cryptographic attacks, especially attacks that target classical blockchain cryptographic schemes, enabled through quantum computations. The evaluation tests the framework on Shor's Algorithm (which can break RSA and ECC keys) and Grover's Algorithm (to speed up brute-force search for hash function) and the quantum-based Sybil attack, replay attack, and MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attack. That is how QuantumShield-BC will keep blockchain transactions resistant against emerging quantum attacks, while ensuring the transactions' integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity. This well-known quantum computing algorithm can factor large numbers and solve discrete logarithm problems in polynomial time. Shor's algorithm for breaking an RSA key has a computational complexity given by where cap N is the RSA key size in bits. The security of classical blockchain systems is based on RSA and ECC, which these systems use for digital signatures. Still, these algorithms' security is compromised by quantum advances27. To reduce this effect, QuantumShield-BC substitutes RSA and ECC aspects with post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes like CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+, capable of evading Shor's polynomial-time factorization. Grover's Algorithm is the second crucial quantum attack vector, which brings a square-root speedup for brute-force cryptographic hash function attacks. For a classical brute-force search, the attack complexity is which reduces the security level of classical hash functions by 2. Another critical security metric is the resistance against Sybil attacks, especially quantum-based ones. In classical blockchain systems, an adversary controlling many validator nodes can compromise the nodes, which is particularly damaging to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. The Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus protocol in QuantumShield-BC ensures that quantum-authenticated validators can only perform block validation. This is the validator authentication function provided by Where \(\:{V}_{node}\) is a validator's authentication status, \(\:{S}_{v}\) is the validator's post-quantum digital signature, and cap H of cap B is the cryptographic hash of a proposed block. This shows why identity verification based on quantum-secure multi-party computation (QMPC) is essential. An attacker could still build a quantum computer today, so forging validator identities is impossible. One critical security risk for the blockchain is replay attacks, where an opponent can take a copy of an earlier transaction and re-inject it into the chain to influence the ledger. Timestamp-based protection used in classic blockchains may be subject to quantum tampering. However, in QuantumShield-BC, Random Number Generation (RNG) is coupled with Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) to avoid nonce duplication and thus prevent replay attacks. Nonce generation utilizes the following QRNG entropy function: Where \(\:{R}_{Q}\) is tthe quantum entropy value, cap Q cap B is the generated bit sequence, p sub i s the probability distribution of each quantum state. Replay attacks are impossible in QRNG because of true randomness. It also evaluates against the quantum man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, in which an adversary attempts to intercept cryptographic key exchanges between blockchain nodes. Quantum decryption can break traditional key exchange protocols such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman and expose attackers to private keys. Unlike classical key exchange, which can be intercepted, QuantumShield-BC deploys Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to establish keys with guaranteed security. As interception changes the quantum state, any eavesdropping is immediately apparent. Quantum computers can potentially compromise the digital signatures on which classical blockchains rely. QuantumShield-BC addresses this issue, as post-quantum signature verification is required in multiple layers, necessitating several independent verifications of each transaction before confirmation. For the multi-party transaction verification function, we have Where \(\:{M}_{C}\) denotes the consensus verification state, \(\:{S}_{i}\) is the quantum-resistant digital signature from validator \(\:i\), a \(\:\:H\left({T}_{i}\right)\) is the cryptographic hash of transaction \(\:{T}_{i}\). QuantumShield-BC exhibits higher resiliency than classical blockchain architectures against favored quantum threats, including the Shor algorithm, the Grover algorithm, Sybil attacks, replay attacks, MITM attacks, and double-spending attempts. In conclusion, the framework offers a resilient solution for the post-quantum world by integrating long-lived security (QKD), post-quantum one-way public key cryptography, QRNG, and decent ralized quantum multiparty computation (QMPC), which combines non-repudiation, tamper-resistance, and trust. QuantumShield-BC is demonstrated to be secure in a quantum-capable adversarial model, which is exceedingly strong and provides a robust security analysis. To this end, we consider a setting in which adversaries have access to scalable quantum computing power, which they can utilize to run algorithms such as Shor's algorithm for integer factorization and discrete logarithms, as well as Grover's algorithm for a quadratic speedup of brute-force search. These capabilities threaten classical blockchain cryptographic primitives in a realistic sense, namely, RSA, ECDSA, and SHA-256. To fight against these attacks, QuantumShield-BC uses post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are security-based on hard lattice problems (specifically Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) and Module Short Integer Solution (Module-SIS) problems). Our system utilizes CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and Kyber algorithms, which have been confirmed to be among the finalists or recommended algorithms in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process, with mathematical assumptions that quantum adversaries cannot effectively counter. These schemes are robust against any quantum decryption attempts, as their running time remains exponential, while such algorithms can only run in polynomial time. Additionally, a quantum key distribution (QKD) method based on the BB84 and E91 protocols is integrated into QuantumShield-BC. Such protocols are based on genuine quantum features (more specifically, the no-cloning theorem and measurement disturbance), which guarantee a very high probability of eavesdrop detection on the quantum channel. This results in information-theoretic security on the exchange of secrets in the key exchange phase, which is not possible classically. Our framework comprises a QRNG (quantum random number generation) system, which guarantees unpredictable leader selection and nonce generation, thereby solving the most common entropy-based attacks on classical pseudo-random number generators. QRNG is not merely based on quantum state collapse or even quantum state preparations over true entropy sources; the 1 s and 0 s output by QRNG are fundamentally resistant to reverse engineering or even state prediction under quantum analysis. When taken together, these elements form a quantum-resilient security architecture. QuantumShield-BC provides such strong quantum resilience across all layers of blockchain operation by explicitly modelling the capabilities of quantum adversaries and then designing each cryptographic and consensus component to withstand those capabilities. Experimental results of the QuantumShield-BC framework prove the system's performance, security, and scalability with quantum-aware parameters. Through a combination of comparative analysis, benchmarking against quantum attacks, and ablation studies, we empirically demonstrate that post-quantum cryptography (PQC), quantum key distribution (QKD), and quantum random number generation (QRNG) each improve operational efficacy across a wide variety of metrics and contexts. The experimental evaluation of the QuantumShield-BC framework was conducted on a prototype developed in Python, which aggregates quantum-safe cryptographic libraries using PyCryptodome and Open Quantum Safe (OQS) toolkit bindings. In the simulation environment, 25 validator nodes, each operated by a Docker container within a local distributed environment, were utilized. Each container adopted a blockchain node style, featuring independent signing, verification, and consensus modules, connected via a virtual network with QKD emulation channels. The post-quantum digital signatures implemented in the prototype are based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium (only level 2), Falcon (512-bit), and SPHINCS + signatures to benefit from NIST standardization and implementation support. For QKD simulation, the BB84 protocol was emulated using pseudo-quantum key exchange logic to enable key reconciliation and eavesdropping detection within the prototype. QRNG values were generated using a high-entropy quantum bitstream sourced from an open-access QRNG API, with a fallback to simulated quantum entropy included to ensure comprehensive test coverage across multiple configurations. Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) was implemented by extending a classical BFT model with validator authentication through post-quantum signatures and QRNG-driven leader selection logic. To ensure replicability, hyperparameters were explicitly configured and kept consistent throughout all experiments. The quantum key length was initialized to 256 bits and refreshed every 10 consensus rounds. Signature key pairs were pre-generated and distributed securely among nodes at initialization. Leader selection invoked QRNG calls per round using a modular mapping of entropy values to active validator indices. We experimented with the prototype, which was run on an Ubuntu 22.04 system with a 16-core CPU, 64GB RAM, and Python 3.10. Modular scripts are included in a codebase for key generation, QKD simulation, transaction processing, and consensus execution. Finally, all dependencies and version information have been specified in the requirements file, allowing for quick reproduction. For each experiment run, logs were recorded, and by randomizing QRNG streams over several seeds, the same benchmarks could be repeated across different setups. This system is fully containerized for deployment onto a Linux-based distributed environment, held to allow for validation by other researchers. Experimental parameters, such as the validator number (n = 100), quantum entropy sampling rate, and PQC scheme settings (e.g., Falcon-512, Dilithium-3), were chosen according to recently recommended benchmarks by NIST, as well as compatibility with open-source post-quantum cryptographic libraries (e.g., liboqs, PQClean). This is a compromise between the potential to work in the real world and a setting where adversaries can be simulated. The validator set sizes in Table 1 are chosen to represent a plausible consortium blockchain for critical infrastructure configuration. The comparison assesses the performance of QuantumShield-BC about a classical blockchain model based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) signatures and a common Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol. The aim was to demonstrate the effects of a quantum-resilient mechanism pool on transaction authentication, consensus formation, and overall system security. In the classical setup, transactions were signed with 256-bit ECDSA keys and verified through PoW mining. The following metrics were measured (over multiple runs): key generation, signature verification, block finalization time, and communication overhead. As shown in Table 2, QuantumShield-BC takes marginally higher initial key and signature generation time since post-quantum algorithms have larger key sizes. Nevertheless, we made it significantly more efficient in terms of consensus compared to the classical model, as it eliminated computational delays associated with PoW through QRNG-based leader selection and lightweight validator authentication. In addition, the use of QKD allowed for secure key exchanges between the nodes, which was not possible in a classical system. Significantly, under simulated quantum attacks (i.e., key extraction using Shor's algorithm simulation), the classical approach was compromised, whereas QuantumShield-BC remained intact in all possible attack settings (Q1-Q3). Such evaluation clearly shows that QuantumShield-BC imposes some small amount of cryptographic overhead on block creation time. However, it achieves much better quantum resistance, faster consensus under a controllable validator set, and sustainable performance that suits the post-quantum blockchain environment. We then compare the performance and security properties of QuantumShield-BC with those of a classical blockchain system using ECDSA and Proof-of-Work. In the classical portions of the system, a post-processed brute-force attack was conducted to simulate Shor's attack on 256-bit ECDSA keys, utilizing pre-quantum factorization emulation to simulate the key extraction attempts. This system only lasted seconds before being compromised (thanks to Cnet for the video). However, QuantumShield-BC, using the post-quantum signatures CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon, was unscathed, since Shor's polynomial-time factorization is not practical against these schemes. In this manner, Grover's attack was copied using a faster brute-force search on classical outputs of the hash based on SHA-256. With SPHINCS + and Keccak-based hashing, QuantumShield-BC maintained complete entropy resistance, but Grover's effect, equivalent to 30 Qubits, has a low influence on practical execution time. Under a Sybil attack simulation, multiple fake validators were injected into the network. The absence of strong identity authentication in the classical system allowed these nodes to influence block validation. QuantumShield-BC mitigated this threat through mandatory validator authentication using post-quantum public keys, effectively rejecting non-verified nodes. For replay attack evaluation, previously signed transactions were resent with slight modifications to their timestamps. The classical blockchain accepted several of these due to nonce reuse or time-based gaps. QuantumShield-BC, which leverages QRNG-generated unique nonces per transaction, successfully detected and rejected all duplicates, thereby maintaining transaction integrity. MITM attacks were simulated during key exchange phases. Public keys were intercepted and replaced in the classical setup, compromising encryption. QuantumShield-BC used QKD to establish symmetric session keys over quantum channels, which collapsed upon interception attempts, instantly flagging the communication as tampered. QuantumShield-BC exhibited robust security across all attack simulations, with no successful breach observed, while the classical model demonstrated significant vulnerabilities in all quantum-threat scenarios. Table 3 presents the results of simulated quantum and adversarial attack scenarios on classical blockchain and QuantumShield-BC. Metrics such as key recovery time, hash strength, and attack success rates reveal that classical systems are highly vulnerable to Shor's, Grover's, and Sybil attacks. In contrast, QuantumShield-BC consistently resists all threats, demonstrating its robustness against post-quantum security challenges. To evaluate QuantumShield-BC's scalability and resource efficiency, experiments were conducted by progressively increasing the number of validators from 10 to 100 and simulating transaction loads ranging from 100 to 10,000 transactions per round. The impact on consensus latency, QKD overhead, and bandwidth usage was recorded across multiple runs. As the validator count increased, the Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) protocol maintained stable consensus formation times up to 50 validators, beyond which latency gradually increased due to cryptographic signature verification and message propagation. However, since Q-BFT does not involve mining or heavy computation, the growth in consensus delay remained sub-linear compared to Proof-of-Work-based systems. The QKD overhead was measured regarding key refresh cycles and communication payload. Each QKD session involved an initial quantum key exchange followed by classical reconciliation. When tested with 25 active validator pairs, the average key generation and reconciliation time per session was within acceptable latency margins. To reduce overhead, keys were reused across multiple secure rounds via hybrid encryption schemes. Bandwidth consumption primarily stemmed from signature broadcasting and validator authentication messages. Nonetheless, the system effectively handled higher throughput by compressing public communication and limiting redundant key exchanges through session-based QKD caching. Transaction throughput remained stable as the system scaled, with the QRNG-based leader selection maintaining randomness quality and fairness even in large validator networks. The system's design ensured that adding new nodes did not linearly increase the consensus cost, thanks to parallel verification and modular consensus thresholding. Overall, QuantumShield-BC demonstrated efficient scalability with moderate resource usage. While it incurs additional cryptographic and QKD overhead compared to classical models, its optimized consensus and key management mechanisms enable practical deployment in moderately large distributed blockchain networks. With some limited overhead for QKD and bandwidth requirements, the framework still achieves low consensus latency and high throughput. It shows that it is efficient and feasible for various applications within a distributed architecture under quantum safety needs and medium to large-sized validator networks. 5, the QuantumShield-BC framework scales well and consumes fewer resources while scaling the validator counts and bi-directional transaction volumes. In subfigure (a), we observe a linear increase in the number of transactions per round from 10 to 100 validators, showcasing one of the system's throughput limits. Figure (b): Consensus latency as a function of the number of validators grows slowly as we increase the validator size. One more signature must be cryptographically verified for each additional validator, but remains less than an order of magnitude arising from PoW-based delays. In subfigure (c), QKD overhead continues to grow gradually, exhibiting the expected extra key exchanges, but remaining tolerable as optimal key reuse strategies mitigate it. Subfigure (d) Bandwidth consumption (per block) is also growing primarily due to post-quantum signature size, but it is still scalable23. As an indicator that QuantumShield-BC can efficiently accept larger loads without degrading the performance, the TPS (transactions per second) continues increasing in subfigure (e). The results confirm the framework's ability for secure and reliable scaling within distributed quantum-secure blockchain domains. We performed an ablation study to evaluate the individual contributions of core components in QuantumShield-BC. We either disabled each component or replaced it with its classical counterpart. For leader selection in the first experiment, the Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) was replaced with a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). We confirmed this allowed intentional bias, repeatable patterns in leader elections between rounds, and a higher degree of targeted consensus attack risk. Additionally, according to entropy tests, the quality of randomness was reduced by 30–40%, reducing the resistance to probabilistic prediction attacks. In our second experiment, we disabled our QKD protocol and reverted to classical elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) for key exchange. Performance did get marginally better since it reduced the amount of communication between the nodes, but it also guaranteed that the system was now open to simulated man-in-the-middle attacks. Attackers could decrypt messages sent by validators as they intercepted public keys, reinforcing the need for QKD to secure validator message delivery from adversaries with the ability to thwart quantum cryptography. In the third configuration, post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (PQC) such as Dilithium were replaced with classical ECDSA for transaction signing and validator authentication. Under simulated Shor's algorithm conditions, ECDSA keys were compromised within seconds, allowing unauthorized transaction approval and Sybil node injection. In contrast, the original PQC configuration showed no such vulnerability, affirming its necessity in a post-quantum threat model. When all quantum components were turned off simultaneously, the system exhibited high throughput but suffered severe security degradation. Transaction tampering, identity spoofing, and leader bias became feasible in multiple test rounds. Conversely, when quantum components were active, all such vulnerabilities were mitigated, with only minor trade-offs in performance. This study confirms that each quantum component in QuantumShield-BC plays a vital, non-redundant role. PQC ensures cryptographic strength, QKD safeguards communication, and QRNG guarantees unbiased consensus. Their integration provides a secure, future-ready blockchain infrastructure that classical counterparts cannot match under quantum threat conditions. Removing QRNG, QKD, or PQC significantly compromises system security, fairness, and unpredictability. While minor performance gains are observed, the entire quantum configuration offers optimal protection against all simulated quantum and classical attacks. Ablation study results showing the impact of disabling QRNG, QKD, and PQC on entropy, security, fairness, communication integrity, and transaction throughput in QuantumShield-BC. Subfigure (b) demonstrates the decline in attack resistance, with classical configurations failing under simulated Shor's and MITM attacks. In (c), consensus fairness drops significantly when QRNG is disabled, indicating increased susceptibility to biased validator selection. Subfigure (d) presents the effect on communication security, showing vulnerability in key exchange when QKD is removed. Lastly, (e) shows a modest TPS gain when quantum components are removed, but at the cost of substantial security degradation. Together, these results validate that each quantum component makes a critical contribution to the robustness and trustworthiness of the QuantumShield-BC system. Additionally, advances in quantum computing pose a significant risk to the cryptographic mechanisms that currently secure most blockchain technologies used today. Well-known classical cryptography methods have been identified in the literature as vulnerable to attack by quantum algorithms, with Shor's and Grover's algorithms capable of breaking key encryption and hash functions in polynomial time, given the number of configurations (Ishai et al.). This has led to a dire necessity for reshaping blockchain frameworks that can effectively withstand post-quantum attacks. However, approaches in the current state of the art tend to suffer from at least one of the following deficiencies: they are computationally expensive, scale badly, couple quantum and classical solutions poorly, or they lack consensus frameworks that encompass the entire threat space. This paper presents QuantumShield-BC, a comprehensive framework for a quantum-secured blockchain designed to address these urgent gaps. It combines lattice-based post-quantum digital signatures with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure channel communication and a Quantum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Q-BFT) consensus protocol for selecting a leader on top of QKD, utilizing Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) for unbiased leader selection. These modules can be easily plugged in, achieving quantum resistance, enabling fair consensus, and protecting against common forms of attack, such as Sybil, replay, and MITM attacks. We validate the security of QuantumShield-BC under quantum attack simulations, demonstrating that it achieves this while maintaining reasonable performance and scalability, outperforming classical blockchain systems. An ablation study indicates that every quantum component strengthens the entire architecture independently. While existing work either provides a point solution (e.g., PQC-only or QKD-only) with key weaknesses or abstracts insights from higher levels, it is the first end-to-end design that balances providing both robustness and compatibility with realistic workloads. QuantumShield-BC establishes a unified architecture that overcomes the limitations of most previous work, providing a solid foundation for developing distributed systems that will remain secure against quantum attacks in the future. This has significant implications for secure digital identity, financial transactions, and the resilience of critical infrastructure. These limitations and directions for future enhancement are discussed in Sect. Although QuantumShield-BC achieves robust post-quantum security, the present work has some limitations. The first reason is that the imno QKD implementation was simulated, rather than deployed with real quantum hardware, which may not capture all operational complexities. However, as a result, the system cannot be generalized to non-public networks, as it was tested on a controlled testbed of a maximum of 100 validators. Third, post-quantum algorithms, such as Dilithium and SPHINCS+, utilize larger keys and signatures with higher computational complexity, which can impact performance, especially in resource-constrained environments. All of these would require further investigation in a real-world setting to ensure scalability, efficiency, and the possibility of integrating with legacy blockchain and quantum infrastructure ecosystems. Quantum computing will inevitably threaten security landscapes by breaking well-established cryptographic primitives, including the public keys used for blockchain security1,21. The framework, which is designed, simulated, and evaluated systematically, achieves enhanced transaction authenticity, consensus fairness, and quantum-resistant security, compared to classical blockchain designs. It also demonstrates, through an ablation study, that each quantum component is critical in preserving the integrity of the entire system. When quantum hardware matures, we will implement real-world QKD channels, optimizing the PQC algorithms for low-resource usage and scaling the system to thousands of validators. In addition, exploring the multi-chain potential of QuantumShield-BC and the benefits of brilliant contract execution in a post-quantum world would also be interesting avenues to pursue. Finally, QuantumShield-BC provides a building block for quantum-safe distributed systems. Its myriad cryptographic, communication, and consensus-level protections make it a stepping stone toward quantum-proof blockchain applications in finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure. Its scalability, hardware adaptability, and operational readiness will be enhanced through further research, enabling deployment in blockchain environments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Skepticism over Wall Street's deepening role in Bitcoin remains strong among early adopters, according to Preston Pysh, co-founder of Bitcoin venture fund Ego Death Capital. Institutional adoption through derivatives raises doubts about Bitcoin's ability to remain a true safe-haven asset. Pysh noted that institutions engaging in “institutional-like things,” such as building out derivatives markets, raise questions within the community about Bitcoin's ability to remain the safe-haven asset it was designed to be. “Am I being scammed, like all the other scams that preceded this wave?” he said, reflecting concerns shared by early holders. In July, analyst Scott Melker, known as The Wolf of All Streets, argued that Bitcoin had in part been “taken over by the very people it was created to hedge against.” For Pysh, the culture that carried Bitcoin from an experimental idea to a trillion-dollar asset was built on individuals self-custodying their holdings and holding through steep downturns. “Those are the people who made Bitcoin what it is,” he said, stressing that many of them now fear being sidelined as institutional players gain control. The remarks come as institutional appetite for Bitcoin continues to rise. A March report by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon found that 83% of institutional investors surveyed planned to increase crypto allocations in 2025, underscoring the scale of the shift now underway. Bitcoin could be on track for a major rally this year, according to Leah Wald, CEO of SOL Strategies. Last week, Wald said she sees the world's largest cryptocurrency potentially climbing to around $175,000 by year-end, a target she described as conservative compared to projections from other top investors and fund managers. Longer term, Wald pointed to ambitious estimates suggesting Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030, underlining the growing conviction among institutional players. Wald emphasized that Bitcoin forecasts are no longer confined to fringe speculation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The platform is building a system that makes using crypto for everyday purchases fast and affordable. Based in London and backed by global investors, SpacePay works with hundreds of wallets so people can spend crypto as easily as a bank card. It keeps costs low for both shoppers and merchants and has already raised over a million dollars in its presale. The goal is to make crypto payments part of daily life everywhere. Customers want quick and easy payments without delays or high fees. Merchants need a system that is steady and dependable. These problems have made it hard for crypto to be used in physical stores, even though more people now own it. It can handle heavy payment traffic without slowing down. It works with more than 325 wallets, including MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and Ledger, meaning customers can pay directly from the wallets they already use. The system also connects to existing payment terminals through an APK. On busy days, such as holiday sales, SpacePay is built to process every payment quickly and efficiently. This could be a better choice compared to most traditional banking systems. It also protects merchants from price changes in crypto. This system is made possible through its volatility protection mechanism, which locks the crypto funds as soon as the payments are processed. Customers can use Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins such as USDT, and more. Merchants only pay a 0.5% fee per transaction, which is lower than most bank card fees. The SpacePay presale is happening at a time when the crypto world is looking for real uses beyond trading. SpacePay's focus on speed, low fees, and a simple user experience makes it stand out. With instant settlement, protection from price swings, and support for hundreds of wallets, it has the tools to make crypto a normal way to pay. For those who believe crypto should be as easy to spend as cash, joining the SPY presale is a way to be part of that future. Token holders can vote on decisions, gain early access to new features, and receive loyalty rewards. They can also share in part of the platform's revenue. The presale is more than a way to raise money; it helps build the network by bringing in early supporters. You can pay with ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, BASE, USDC, USDT, or a bank card. Once your wallet is connected and has funds, choose how much SPY you want to buy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has rocketed to an all-time high this year, with its latest boom enticing a new wave of surprising and controversial new cryptocurrencies. Now, as Kanye West suddenly joins the crypto craze, Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff has admitted he got bitcoin and crypto wrong ten years ago, warning a coming dollar “crisis" could propel crypto higher and joining some of the most bullish bitcoin price forecasters in sounding the alarm over the $37 trillion debt pile. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “Almost a decade ago I was the Harvard economist that said that bitcoin was more likely to be worth $100 than 100,000,” Rogoff posted to X. This week, minutes from the latest Federal Reserve interest rate-setting meeting showed officials remain concerned about price pressures, though Fed chair Jerome Powell opened the door to cutting interest rates in September at his closely-watched Jackson Hole Economic Symposium speech, sending the bitcoin price—and other major cryptocurrencies including ethereum and XRP—higher while torpedoing the U.S. dollar. “This is bullish for the front end of the yield curve and risk assets, where bitcoin is a fast horse in the race," Jessy Gilger, investment advisor at bitcoin financial services company Unchained, said in emailed comments. While the mid and long end of the curve remain uncertain, bitcoin's sensitivity to macro signals means it's poised to ride any wave of optimism from rate cut expectations.” Armstrong named increasing regulatory clarity, the president Donald Trump's bitcoin strategic reserve, and Wall Street adoption among other factors that include the U.S. debt‑to‑GDP ratio. “The debt‑to‑GDP ratios are the thing to watch usually, I think,” Armstrong said in a conversation posted to YouTube with payments giant Stripe cofounder John Collison. So we're within sight of a pretty dangerous threshold, historically.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, as Congress considers historic legislation related to these assets, worth more than $250 billion as of August 2025, research reveals a problem with their models: the more effort they make to maintain their dollar peg, the more vulnerable they may be to catastrophic runs. The Trump administration has prioritized stablecoin legislation, predicting these tokens would "ensure American dollar dominance internationally." However, an NBER study reveals a fundamental problem at the heart of stablecoin design. The same mechanisms that keep stablecoin prices at $1 can make them more prone to panic runs—not less. In short, the findings challenge conventional wisdom that more competition in markets provides more stability by revealing a previously unrecognized tradeoff between daily price stability that stable coins demand and the ability to come back from a crisis. Here is a table showing some of the major players in the industry, with their level of concentration, which we discuss below: Unlike your bank account, you can't directly cash out most stablecoins with their issuers. The researchers modeled various common triggers that could spark a crisis: Arbitrageurs act as intermediaries who buy stablecoins when others sell, helping maintain the $1 price. But the research reveals a crucial twist: Having more arbitrageurs keeping the dollar peg doesn't mean less risk—it means more. It's helpful to remember two points about stablecoins that prove crucial for the study: With that in mind, the researchers pointed out what would happen should there be a run on the two biggest stablecoins: An analogy financial experts often use for market runs is a building's emergency exit. In this case, here's how the analogy works: In other words, the paradox is that arbitrageurs, by doing their job in the market, could cause the sell-off and drop in stablecoin prices they were meant to prevent. As the researchers note, "Both Tether and Circle have significant run risk" despite their different approaches. The typical approach to addressing this problem would be to require more arbitrageurs, as too few insiders might not have the necessary resources to prevent a devastating run. However, it turns out that simply increasing the number of arbitrageurs also creates significant risks. What's more, there's no way out of this tradeoff: either you have price stability—as stablecoins promise in their very name—or you have less resilience should a crisis hit. Annual risks of 3.3% to 3.9% might seem small, but consider the following: analyzing government data, we calculate that your risk of a similar issue in your Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-backed account is 1/3900th less (0.001%), which itself is far less than your chances of getting hit by lightning in a given year (0.03%). Meanwhile, if you held a stablecoin for 10 years, you'd have about a one-in-three shot of experiencing major problems. Research reveals that not only are stablecoins far riskier than their names suggest, but in a 10-year period, you'd have about a one in three chance of a major run on assets. Given their central role in the $3.87 trillion crypto ecosystem and the paradox that potential solutions to address their inherent risks could make them even more fragile, this means any system that includes crypto assets is built on foundations far shakier than many people realize.

Blockchain investigator ZachXBT revealed on Thursday that a social engineering scam led to the theft of about $91.4 million in bitcoin.

A crypto investor in the United States lost 783 bitcoin—valued at $91.4 million—after falling victim to a scammer posing as a technical support agent. The fraudster obtained the investor's wallet password and emptied the account within seconds.

Similar schemes are on the rise, with industry estimates suggesting that as much as $3.1 billion could be stolen from digital wallets through such methods by 2026.

The attack, which occurred on Aug. 19, saw the perpetrator impersonate a hardware wallet support representative and trick the victim into surrendering their wallet credentials, resulting in the loss of 783 bitcoin.

The incident reflects a broader pattern of social engineering scams seen last year. It adds to what has already been a difficult 2025 for crypto investors, who lost $3.1 billion to attacks and fraud in the first half alone.

Once the transfer was made, the stolen funds were funneled through a typical laundering process, including multiple deposits into Wasabi Wallet, a privacy tool often used to obscure transaction trails.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like a 21st-century space race, the world's biggest economic powers are staking their claim in a little-known type of digital currency that could revolutionize — or severely disrupt — the way people, companies and countries exchange money. Think of it as a "digital dollar": Stablecoins have a one-for-one exchange rate with their real-world twins, which investors keep in a reserve as collateral against more volatile types of crypto. "Right now, obviously, stablecoins are not super popular. You can't go into a Loblaws and pay for your groceries with stablecoins," said Claire Wilson, a policy and research analyst at the Council of Canadian Innovators. "But it's conceivable that in the future, because they enable faster transactions and have lower transaction fees, that they could be more widely used." While the currency hasn't yet entered mainstream use, "one of the biggest use cases that proponents often mention is remittances," according to Wilson. Champions say that stablecoins will make international money transfers less costly — including for immigrants who, while sending remittances back to family members in their birth country, are smacked with steep cross-border fees. "So normally if you're sending money back often to Latin America [or] Africa, the bank fees are a lot less trivial than sending money between, let's say, Canada and Germany," said Wilson. That makes the transfer of payments faster and smoother — but critics worry that stablecoins, like other forms of crypto, can be used for illegal financial transactions because they bypass the traditional infrastructure that financial systems use to guard against illicit activity. If stablecoins lost their one-to-one value, customers might lose confidence and rush to withdraw the stablecoins in physical dollars, prompting a crash. Only recently have major countries established regulatory frameworks to oversee the dissemination of stablecoins. U.S. President Donald Trump's GENIUS Act was passed in July, opening the door for private companies to issue and accept stablecoins — but the legislation was also criticized by Democrats for not having adequate fraud and corruption protection measures. Now, Amazon and Walmart are reportedly looking into developing their own stablecoins, as are big U.S. banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Stablecoins are similar to but distinct from central bank-issued digital currencies, which are issued by a country's central bank and backed by the government. They are also not the same thing as equities, like publicly-traded stocks from Amazon or Apple, because they don't generate profits over time. Both in Europe and the U.S., stablecoins were classified as e-money tokens, rather than as securities, under their regulatory frameworks. Canada, by contrast, recognizes the digital coins as securities — which some view as a regulatory error that makes it hard for people to issue stablecoins backed by Canadian assets. "Canada, in general, is quite a fintech-friendly country, but it's also cautious," said Katrin Tinn, an associate professor of finance at McGill University. But the Bank of Canada quietly dropped its central bank digital currency project last year, saying it would instead focus on preparing for the evolution of payments in Canada and around the world through policy research and analysis. Other countries are rushing to regulate stablecoins so that they can hedge against American currency dominance as matter of national sovereignty, said Wilson. The U.S. dollar has for years been the world's reserve currency of choice, but that reputation was thrown into question earlier this year when foreign investors appeared to be pulling out of the U.S. Treasury bonds market. Therein lies the problem for countries from Canada to China. China made a big bet when it launched its central bank digital coin in 2019, challenging private companies like Alipay and WeChat as they staked their claim in the country's digital payments market, according to Christian Catalini, the founder of MIT's Cryptoeconomics Lab and former chief economist of Meta FinTech. Now, with the U.S. having passed a regulatory framework for private companies to experiment with stablecoins, "China is probably realizing that central bank digital currencies may not be the right technological platform and they might be too slow [to develop]," said Catalini, who was part of the team behind Facebook's now-defunct stablecoin, Demi. Catalini argues that the U.S. has shaped the last few decades of foreign policy and geopolitics with institutions like the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and by imposing sanctions on its adversaries. "But of course, China has greater ambitions and so as the role of China changes, I think you should expect more and more technology coming also from the East," he said. It's extremely unlikely — but "stranger things have happened," said Catalini. "Typically we've seen with major wars, with major reshuffling of the global economic order, new currencies may emerge as the standard." Jenna Benchetrit is the senior business writer for CBC News.
