                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JFK was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas. Is the federal government in possession of a tape that could blow the John F. Kennedy assassination wide open? The official story is that Lee Harvey Oswald acted as a lone gunman. Oswald was later murdered by Jack Ruby before facing a trial. The infamous assassination has long been tied to conspiracy theories. The most notable is that there were multiple shooters, and a mysterious tape might shine a light on what happened that dark day in Dallas. US President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas. There is now a legal battle unfolding over the tape. Nix's granddaughter, Linda Gayle Nix Jackson, also believes the tape could be worth up to $900 million, and the family's fight for it centers on the government taking it without proper compensation. (Photo by NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images) The tape could prove to be critical for one shockingly simple reason: The grassy knoll has long been believed by some people to be the location of a second shooter, if such a person ever existed to begin with. No clear footage has ever been released giving the public a good idea of what was happening on the grassy knoll. Either way, it could be the missing piece of evidence needed to rule out or confirm the most popular conspiracy theory. There have long been conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Every single piece of evidence and information tied to the JFK assassination should be made public. Either way, the public deserves to see it all. You are agreeing to OutKick's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, but don't worry we don't spam.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The quiet town of Varginha in Brazil has long been associated with whispers of extraterrestrial activity, but nothing prepared the world for the claim of Dr Italo Venturelli, a prominent neurosurgeon, who insists he performed surgery on a living alien. His testimony adds a startling new dimension to the infamous 1996 Varginha UFO incident, a case often described as 'Brazil's Roswell'. For decades, the story has divided scientists, UFO researchers and sceptics, but Venturelli's account has reignited debate about whether humanity may have already encountered life beyond Earth. In a startling revelation, Venturelli described being face-to-face with a sentient, intelligent being in 1996, shedding new light on the infamous Varginha UFO incident and sparking debate among scientists, UFO enthusiasts, and sceptics alike. While driving early one morning, local pilot Carlos de Souza witnessed a cylindrical craft, initially mistaken for a blimp, losing and then regaining altitude before it finally crashed in an open field. De Souza rushed to the site, observing unusual debris that was lightweight, metallic, and strangely resilient, unlike anything he had seen before. Within minutes, a military convoy arrived, sealing off the area. De Souza recalled being threatened by armed soldiers who ordered him to leave immediately, warning him never to speak about what he had witnessed. The crash site was near a river, close to where local children later reported seeing small, unusual creatures, a discovery that would fuel months of UFO investigations in the region. Dr Venturelli has now claimed he was called to treat a living alien recovered from the crash. Speaking in a rare interview, he described the being as highly intelligent and aware, with control over its surroundings despite the trauma. He also revealed that a video of the procedure exists, though it remains in private hands. Samples of soil and vegetation taken from the crash site were later tested, showing chemical residues unlike any known substances. Over the years, dedicated researchers like James Fox have compiled detailed records of the Varginha case, including testimonies, photographs, and film recordings. Despite widespread scepticism and ridicule from mainstream media, particularly a notorious broadcast by Rede Globo in Brazil, witnesses remain steadfast in their claims. 'All of these testimonies should serve as a rallying cry to continue gathering evidence,' Venturelli insisted. As the world absorbs these revelations, the possibility of contact with extraterrestrial life moves from science fiction to a question of history, science, and human curiosity, leaving both believers and sceptics grappling with one simple question: could life from another world truly have been touched by human hands?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A passionate group of women rediscovered fitness in VR. They're furious with Mark Zuckerberg for killing their community. At 69, the snowy-haired, retired elementary school teacher hops into her Meta Quest headset five days a week, for roughly 60 to 90 minutes at a time. She's not attending live concerts or watching immersive films. Supernatural isn't dead, but it might as well be. A few weeks ago, Meta shut down three VR studios as part of broader layoffs in its Reality Labs division. As a result, Supernatural will no longer get new content. That's why Dickson is spearheading an online social media campaign to save Supernatural from slowly fading into oblivion. You can choose from a library of dance-like Flow workouts, boxing, or even meditative breathing classes. Like any connected fitness game, Supernatural's stickiness relies on an ever-evolving content library. New music, levels, and choreography keep people hooked because they not only keep things fresh, but strengthen the bond between users and the game's charismatic coaches. Perhaps it is not surprising that he killed Supernatural.” For a game like Supernatural, shutting down content production was a death knell that left Dickson and countless other Supernatural fans blindsided with shock, then grief. Dickson is what your typical Supernatural user looks like. In an emerging tech category with expensive hardware dominated by 18-to-34-year-old men, the majority of Supernatural's warriors are women, people over 50, and folks with limited mobility. Not only has the company royally screwed up, but they're also not letting Supernatural go without a fight. “My opinion of Meta can be summed up as @*#&&1 $&#^! Lynn has been playing for five years, roughly three to four times a week. Perhaps it is not surprising that he killed Supernatural.” Unlike Meta, Within was an independent studio with roots in music videos, feature films, and creative projects. In a Decoder interview, Within cofounder Chris Milk described building Supernatural as “making something that is meaningful to another human being” — something more akin to immersive art than a means to solidify dominance in the VR market. That, in no small part, explains why some fans have reacted so viscerally. Supernatural was widely considered a successful VR app before Meta ever entered the picture. In fact, when Meta announced it planned to buy it in 2021, the Federal Trade Commission launched a probe to try and block the acquisition — partly because Meta had already acquired Beat Saber, a similar VR game, and Supernatural threatened its dominance. This is what we're fighting on every single level globally right now,” says Dickson. … Of course there are far bigger things to fight for right now, and I do. I have nothing to give or fight with for the big causes.” “I despise Meta along with the oligarchs, the top one percent that continue to destroy our world and kill anything that brings joy and beauty of human experience and connection because their only goal is to make a profit.” “I despise Meta along with the oligarchs, the top one percent that continue to destroy our world and kill anything that brings joy and beauty of human experience and connection because their only goal is to make a profit,” agrees DeeDee Henry, an avid Supernatural athlete since 2020. Henry, who has participated in beta testing and user interviews for the app, says she finds it “overwhelming” to convey how much Supernatural's community has impacted her. “We have built a community of love and support with each other. To its diehard fans, Supernatural was more than “just a game.” It was a virtual place to prioritize health while making friends. A year ago, the two were complete strangers. They were randomly paired together through Supernatural's Together multiplayer feature, which enables joint workouts, supports voice chat, and allows players to create teams. A year later, Dickson and Henry have formed “Team Sunshine” with Henry's 75-year-old mother, Darlene “Cookie” Norman, and a fourth friend, Kelly Hines. Marginalized users say Supernatural let them exercise without judgment. Inside the headset, they could lunge, squat, and swipe at targets just like anyone else. They didn't have to worry about being looked down on for not having six-pack abs, being older, working out in a wheelchair, or having a limited range of movement. More than 50 Supernatural athletes reached out to The Verge specifically to share how the game helped them through deep depression, bouts with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses, as well as rehabilitation from serious injuries. Some have lost a significant amount of weight, while others say it's the only form of accessible fitness that keeps them engaged. Supernatural is the only reason I bought my Quest 2 headset and is the only cardio exercise I do,” says Vickie Bitter, another Supernatural athlete in her 50s. “I can't move my ankle, I can't stand up on my toes or anything,” says Jennifer Boyer, a longtime Supernatural athlete who needs ankle-foot orthotics, a type of brace that goes from the bottom of the foot to the knee. For Boyer, maintaining core strength is a necessity while using the braces to prevent injury. Unfortunately, Boyer didn't like gyms because she felt self-conscious and found repetitive strength routines boring. In these levels, different types of triangles fly toward users to signal whether they should squat or lean into side lunges. Users with limb differences can also pick a wheelchair mode, choose single-handed play, or adjust settings to accommodate their mobility needs. You're doing squats and side lunges — I can't do traditional lunges where you step forward and drop a knee to the ground. “I introduce many of my patients to VR. I have a pretty high take rate, meaning that they like it and enjoy it as an intervention,” says Jeanna Duryee, a physical therapist. Supernatural gave me a tool to use to get people that I never seen smile, smile broadly while exercising. The fervent devotion among Supernatural fans is reminiscent of another connected fitness platform: Peloton. Like Peloton users, Supernatural athletes have to invest in niche hardware. Meta may have invested (and lost) billions in VR and the metaverse over the years, but it's notably shifted gears toward its AI. Given the game's popularity and Meta's ambitions to dominate the VR market, one might think it'd be a no-brainer to invest in Supernatural. But according to Boyer, Dickson, and dozens of other Supernatural fans, the decline in quality was undeniable once Meta acquired Supernatural. “When Meta said they were going to buy it, everyone was like, ‘Oh my god, kiss of death.' It wasn't long after Meta bought it that they stopped having the extra features they said they would have,” says Boyer, a longtime Supernatural beta tester before and after Meta's acquisition. “When Meta said they were going to buy it, everyone was like, ‘Oh my god, kiss of death. Prior to the acquisition, Boyer says you could tune into video calls with Supernatural coaches. While athletes couldn't speak to them directly, they could type in the chat and receive personalized shoutouts and responses. Instead of directly hopping into chats with coaches, fans were limited to seeing videos and hoping the algorithm would surface their comments on coaches' posts. Boyer asserts that compared to the original owners, Meta never took an interest in getting feedback on new features either. Then they fired all the user experience people who were managing, pulling together those fun things with the coaches. Then there were no more beta group chats,” laments Boyer, noting that soon there were no new backdrops for the game.“Other app developers should take note of how capriciously Meta fought for, then ditched Supernatural. If you make something you love, you might make a pile of money selling it to Meta, but they're likely to mismanage and kill it,” adds Matt Krzycki, an early adopter of Supernatural. “It wasn't like when they cancel your favorite show, and you feel bad for everyone in the production and hope the actors get new roles. Instead, these were six people who I personally spent half an hour with almost every day for almost a year,” says Erica Carter, speaking of the Supernatural coaches. “So when they were laid off, when they posted videos trying to be strong and supportive, putting the community first — gosh, it hurts. When coach Leanne Pendante's husband died, the entire community rallied around her with an outpouring of love and support. “Yes, I did get laid off and it was very difficult because (a) I wasn't expecting it and (b) this Supernatural community, if you have not met them, they are incredible and they just swallow you with so much love and I just wanted to stay there forever,” coach Mindy Lai shared on Instagram. “Apologies for not hopping on earlier in the week once all the news broke, but, you know, I got a family to provide for, so once everything happened I had to put my feet to the concrete and hit the streets and start making moves,” says coach Antonio “Doc” Harrison in an Instagram post. I just want to get in and do a workout, a group workout, let's see who's in there.' And it's hard,” coach Mark Harari says in a recently posted video, trying to motivate discouraged Supernatural users to put their headsets back on. … We're still a part of this community, we're here still to love, and support, and to raise up, and to stand by your side when things are tough.” Instead, spokesperson Johanna Peace pointed to several new features and content Meta released after the acquisition, including a price drop in the subscription, a multiplayer mode, and new artists series and collaborations. But barring a reversal in its decision, there's little Meta can say to comfort Supernatural fans. Every single fan who spoke with The Verge has said their trust in the company has been shattered. For most, it's a matter of picking which is the lesser evil moving forward. On Reddit and the Facebook group, some have already posted screenshots of canceling their subscriptions. Others, like Dickson, are trying to rally Supernatural fans to create a grassroots movement that could save the game. Of those who spoke to The Verge, everyone said they'd stick with Supernatural until they can't any longer. For most, the biggest source of anxiety is the music, as no one trusts Meta will renew licenses once they've run out. Once that happens, they fear workouts will begin disappearing, creating holes within the existing content library. They don't deserve it,” says Boyer, who invested in three Meta Quest headsets, along with several straps and accessories. That's the message I got from them and as a result, I will never buy those glasses, their watch, or any of the other things they're trying to develop.” After five years of playing Supernatural, Montoulieu decided to channel his grief into creating a Supernatural-like prototype game for the Apple Vision Pro. Montoulieu says he's already been hit up by avid Supernatural fans interested in testing and creating custom workouts. For Dickson, the bare minimum that she wants from her campaign to save Supernatural is for the program to remain on Meta's servers with no disappearing songs or workouts. “What I'd really like to see is an investor — someone of vision — to come along and possibly buy the rights of Supernatural and make it independent again,” says Dickson. “Maybe on a different platform that's supportive, like Steam. Through a spokesperson, Chris Milk declined to comment. Right now, it's between denial and incandescent anger. Frustration with Meta (and colorful insults for Zuckerberg) sits directly alongside hope that this isn't truly the end. Supernatural coaches still pop in to post motivational videos, challenging users to venture back into their headsets and take heart in the community, existing content library, and their shared experiences. For now, Dickson is hoping to stir up the community's fighting spirit. Or perhaps signal that a dedicated community is still there for potential buyers. After all, Dickson says, Disney reinstated Jimmy Kimmel after a week of public pressure — who's to say it's impossible? It's possible Supernatural will miraculously get a second life. More likely, it'll end up as another casualty of Meta's shifting ambitions. But, among the hundreds of forum comments and over 50 interviews I've conducted, perhaps this sentiment from Supernatural fan Sherer Minor sums it up best. In the meantime, I'll keep logging in and punching the air, because punching people is frowned upon.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, researchers say that era may finally be ending. A new push to detect and track Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAP, is promising something long missing from the debate: hard data. Backed by cutting edge sensors, coordinated observers and public transparency, researchers say the so called 'UAP Trap' could finally prove what is really flying through Earth's airspace. The renewed urgency comes as governments openly acknowledge that UAP are real but poorly understood. Military pilots have testified to Congress about objects that defy known technology, while defence agencies admit they often lose track of them the moment sensors lock on. Without calibrated instruments and shared data, rumours fill the gaps. The summit brings together scientists, engineers and policy experts who argue that modern technology has finally caught up with the mystery. High speed cameras, advanced radar, infrared imaging and acoustic sensors can now monitor the skies across multiple ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. When combined, these tools allow researchers to rule out aircraft, drones, weather events and sensor glitches. What remains, they say, is the real anomaly. Experts explain that one sensor alone can mislead. Some groups are already operating mobile labs fitted with night vision, thermal imaging and audio sensors that detect sounds beyond human hearing. Others are testing systems that capture thousands of frames per second, allowing scientists to study rapid acceleration and sudden direction changes in detail. This layered detection model is what researchers call the 'UAP Trap'. It is designed to catch fleeting events that once slipped away unnoticed or unproven. One striking feature of the new effort is how much it relies on civilians. Pilots, police officers and ordinary witnesses are often the first to spot unusual objects, yet their reports have historically gone nowhere. Organisers of the summit argue that this must change. New reporting networks aim to collect these accounts alongside sensor data, building a fuller picture of each event. Veteran researchers involved in the project caution against promises of sudden disclosure. Many say they have heard such claims for decades. Lawmakers are already pressing for limits on over classification, while scientists insist that transparency is essential for public trust. Whether UAP turn out to be unknown technology, natural phenomena or something more extraordinary, researchers say the truth must be grounded in evidence. With crowded skies, rising safety concerns and growing public curiosity, the push to understand UAP is no longer fringe. As the 'UAP Trap' comes online, scientists believe the world may finally get clear answers to a question that has lingered for generations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But many of the biggest open questions in his case remain unanswered. But many of the biggest open questions in his case remain unanswered. Once a top FBI fugitive, Wedding finally faced a U.S. judge in federal court this week, where he pleaded not guilty to 17 felony charges — including murder, drug trafficking and other alleged crimes. It was a pivotal moment in the years-long pursuit of a Canadian former Olympic snowboarder authorities have labelled one of the most violent criminals in the world, and the first step in what promises to be a sweeping prosecution involving dozens of co-defendants. Mexican and American authorities had cast a wide dragnet to catch the fugitive, and now they have their target. Still, many of the biggest mysteries in this unfolding crime story remain unanswered. Notorious fugitive Ryan Wedding was arrested in Mexico January 22, 2026 It's been over two years since Jagtar Singh Sidhu, 57, and Harbhajan Kaur Sidhu, 55, were killed in an attack allegedly orchestrated by Wedding. Their daughter, Jaspreet, was shot 13 times but survived. Authorities later revealed the hit men were allegedly hired by Wedding to kill an Ontario trucker who stole a cocaine shipment from his organization — the killers had the wrong people. What is known is that the man worked for trucking companies in the Peel Region and has since been given some element of protection from local police, though the exact details of this are unknown. It would be natural to assume the man may have previously rented the home where the attack occurred, but local police and American authorities have not confirmed this. While some arrests have been made in other local shootings loosely linked to the case, police have yet to identify or lay charges against any gunmen in the Sidhus' murders. “We sympathize with the Sidhu family, who continues to grieve their loved ones as they await answers,” OPP Det. Brian McDermott told the Star in a statement this week. He said the probe remains active and ongoing. “We cannot speculate on whether developments in other regions, including arrests, may support the investigation but we remain committed to bringing answers to the family by identifying and arresting the individual(s) responsible for taking the lives of two innocent people,” McDermott said, urging anyone with information to contact police. Wedding's capture has become a major diplomatic flashpoint between two governments. At issue: What exactly did U.S. agents do inside Mexico? If you ask American law enforcement leaders, and Wedding's lawyer, they'd tell you that's wrong; he was nabbed in what the FBI Director Kash Patel has called a “high-stakes” tactical operation by U.S. agents. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum has challenged Patel's description, saying her government would never allow a foreign power to execute such an operation. Only adding to the confusion, Sheinbaum also publicly pointed to a faked Instagram photo as proof that Wedding had, indeed, surrendered. While the FBI has declined to share more details about the nature of his arrest, the Wall Street Journal has reported that Mexican security forces were closing in when they were joined by U.S. authorities who, following an intense negotiation, apprehended Wedding. It remains unclear if we'll ever learn the truth. If Wedding did surrender, it could signal he'd become more of a liability than an asset to the Mexican cartels. Authorities have nabbing the guys behind the drug distribution, his alleged money man, and even his so-called “cocaine lawyer.” They've also placed immense public pressure on the fugitive and his inner circle after adding him to the FBI's most wanted list and dangling an enormous $15-million reward. That's a lot of heat; the cartel could have told Wedding, “Look, either give yourself up or, worse, we're not protecting you anymore,” said retired FBI agent Brett Kalina, who once arrested the Canadian on drug trafficking charges in California in 2008. In a scenario in which Wedding has lost the favour of the Sinaloa Cartel — once run by Joaquín (El Chapo) Guzmán — a U.S. prison may be the only place he's safe from his former associates. If Wedding is willing to co-operate, Kalina suggested he wouldn't necessarily turn on people in the cartels, but rather their partners around the world. But that would be a dangerous choice, Kalina said — “He will not survive prison if he gives up the wrong people.” The Star interviewed Estrada this week at his Los Angeles law firm, where he now works as a trial attorney. Striking a deal with any defendant “requires a measured, thoughtful approach and decision by the government,” Estrada said. However, he added, some people simply should not be afforded the opportunity because their crimes are too severe. But the known timeline of his rise to becoming an alleged international drug lord has some surprisingly large gaps. The FBI first caught wind of Wedding in 2008, when he and a low-level drug dealer flew from Vancouver to California to purchase 24 kilograms of cocaine from an informant. By 2013, undercover agents with the RCMP had infiltrated his network. They'd spend the next two years uncovering various schemes by Wedding and his associates to allegedly buy and import tons of cocaine linked to Colombian and Mexican cartels into Canada. Around then, court records obtained by the Star paint a picture of Wedding as a cartel middleman, allegedly co-ordinating drug shipments from the Caribbean with men tied to El Chapo. In 2015, the RCMP charged Wedding and more than a dozen others in the undercover sting dubbed Operation Harrington — but Wedding was never arrested. A decade later, the U.S. indictments from 2024 and 2025 suggest Wedding spent the intervening time building up a billion-dollar-a-year organization. First, the drugs would be cooked and tested in “cocaine kitchens” run with the help of Colombian neo-paramilitary groups. Next, they'd ship the cocaine by boat and plane into Mexico, hundreds of kilos at a time. Then it was onto semi-trucks destined for California stash houses. And finally, it was loaded onto trucks driven by GTA truckers bound for Ontario. Still, it's a huge leap to go from a mid-level cartel figure in the mid-2010s to an alleged top boss — and we don't know how he got there. Wedding, left, in court with his defence attorney Anthony Colombo. If you ask Patel, the FBI director, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, they'll tell you Wedding is the modern-day version of two of Latin America's most notorious drug lords, Sinaloa's El Chapo and Colombia's Pablo Escobar. Those comparisons are clearly an exaggeration — but by how much? “I don't make comparisons like that,” Estrada said; he thinks each defendant should be looked at “based on their particular conduct.” With Wedding, it's “really, a tragic story,” he continued, “not just squandering his opportunities, but rejecting them, wholly to go in the opposite direction and really become a scourge on his own nation and other nations.” U.S. authorities have said that Wedding is behind “dozens” of murders, but the indictments link his organization only to five killings. Comparisons to some of the most-notorious drug lords in the history of Latin America are, at best, an exaggeration. Comparisons to some of the most-notorious drug lords in the history of Latin America are, at best, an exaggeration. Wedding himself has been charged with three killings near Toronto, including the Sidhus', and the assassination of a federal witness in Colombia. Attorneys stick to what they can prove, Estrada notes. “It would not shock me to see that there were other (murders), but when you're prosecuting cases on behalf of the United States government, it'd be very precise and stick to the facts,” the former prosecutor said. Investigators will have “significant” amounts of credible intelligence that may not be attached to any criminal proceeding due to a lack of substantive evidence that meets the threshold of usability, Chrustie said. As well, some evidence cannot be entered in court because “it's too sensitive.” In short, we just don't yet know how close Wedding was to being what Bondi and Patel claim. The FBI released photos of items believed to be owned by Ryan Wedding that were seized in December by Mexican law enforcement partners. His exact whereabouts in Sinaloa have not been made public, but his address was listed as Los Mochis, a coastal city in the state's northwest, in a Mexican court filing last year. (The court records, first reported by local media, show Wedding tried to prevent law enforcement from executing a warrant for his arrest and extradition in mid-February 2025 — just weeks after the assassination of the federal witness.) That life is over now, but his network hasn't yet been fully dismantled. Fewer than 10 Mercedes CLK-GTR roadsters were ever made, with the example seized by the FBI worth an estimated $13 million (U.S.). Fewer than 10 Mercedes CLK-GTR roadsters were ever made, with the example seized by the FBI worth an estimated $13 million (U.S.). Authorities are still looking for multiple associates, including the suspects who killed the witness, Jonathan Acebedo Garcia, at a restaurant in Medellín, Colombia, on Jan. 31, 2025. The victim, a Montrealer who met Wedding in prison before working with him, was set to testify at trial. And while Wedding's days on the run are over, it remains to be seen what will happen in court — and how, or if, the death of Acebedo Garcia hurts the prosecution. But the chances of him facing trial on those offences are incredibly small if he is convicted in the U.S. Calvi Leon is a Toronto-based general assignment reporter for the Star.
