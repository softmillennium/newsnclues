                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>George Russell says he's ready to fight for a World Championship in 2026, while also harboring hopes of going toe to toe with four-time champion Max Verstappen. George Russell says he's ready to fight for the Formula 1 world title with Mercedes but admits that, while the Barcelona Shakedown was encouraging, it's "too early to say" if this year's Silver Arrows will be the leading contender. Mercedes had a very productive three days of running at a cold Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya as drivers and teams focused on understanding their new machines that have been built to sweeping new chassis and power unit regulations for 2026 – rather than looking at performance. "I feel ready to fight for a World Championship, and whether we have that comment above us or not, that does not change my approach one single bit," said Russell, when speaking to media as Mercedes officially launched their 2026 F1 campaign. "I'm working so hard with the team, everybody here has been working flat out to really maximise this new set of regulations. When asked how he feels about potentially going up against four-time world champion Max Verstappen in a title fight, Russell said: "I'd love for it to turn out that way. I do want to go head-to-head with Max and obviously Lando [Norris] had a great season last year. "But no, it doesn't add any more pressure. I think probably the fans and people were expecting, you know, to potentially be Mercedes versus McLaren because there was a lot of anticipation that Mercedes would clearly have the best power unit. "But it seems like the other power unit manufacturers have done a good job and we know that Red Bull have always had an amazing car, even through the years of dominance of Mercedes. So, yeah, I think he's very much going to be in the fight this year. Speaking about Russell's title credentials, boss Toto Wolff said: "It is always nice if your driver is the favourite with the bookmakers, and I think he [Russell] deserves it because he is one of the best. He has shown us where the performance of the car is and has overall been more than great to us. There was no chase for performance in Barcelona, as the focus really was on learning about the cars and the new systems that are in place for this year – and that's why Russell is keen not to get ahead of himself. But he did concede that Mercedes – who have failed to contend for the title since 2021 – are in a better place, probably their best since 2021, at this point in the year. "And to be honest, in the early days like this, when it could be a really bad car, and you can sort of highlight those negatives early on, we don't believe it is. "This is something we've not really experienced since 2021 as a team so we're sort of ticking the boxes of everything that we want to tick, but we can't discount our rivals, because as I said, there was a lot of talk around the Red Bull power unit not being up to standard in year one, but from what we've seen so far, they've definitely delivered. So the truth is that there could be a good fight on our hands, but we're satisfied with what we've experienced so far." Mercedes, like all of their rivals, are playing down their expectations for this year – and that's no surprise given they are running very different cars with all-new power units built to regulations that have seen the biggest overhaul in more than a decade. But it is clear that as a starting point, Mercedes are in a better place – as Russell said – than they have been in recent years. Ahead of each of those campaigns, Mercedes knew very early on that they were not the favourites – and that they would struggle to get in the mix. This time around, though, they don't have that same feeling. Critically, the car is performing as their simulation tools said they would. This is the first time that Russell will have felt that feeling since he joined Mercedes in 2022 – so it's perhaps not surprising that he is buoyed by how the car feels after three days of running. He even said in his media briefing that he felt confident to push from the very first lap in Barcelona. Based on vibes, these are the best Mercedes have given off since 2021. Of course, Russell and the team don't know what the other teams are doing so it would be unwise to get too excited. But given Mercedes have history of delivering a class-leading power unit at a regulation change and that they feel encouraged by the response by the chassis in early runs (which is the opposite of what they have felt for the last four years) you can understand why there is a bit of a spring in their step. We should get more of an idea of where they stack up next week in Bahrain when work on the set-up of the cars begins – and an even clearer look in the second test when they start chasing performance but it might not be until Australia – or even the first four or five races – until we know for sure if Mercedes are back in the game as world title contenders.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How will Isack Hadjar stack up against Max Verstappen in comparison to the Red Bull driver's previous team mates? Having achieved four World Championships, 71 wins, 127 podiums and 48 pole positions since his arrival in Formula 1 more than a decade ago, Max Verstappen has earned his place amongst the most successful drivers in the sport's history – which arguably makes the prospect of becoming his team mate slightly intimidating. It is a challenge that Isack Hadjar is about to face, with the 21-year-old the next to race alongside Verstappen at Red Bull following the demotion of Yuki Tsunoda to a test and reserve role. Hadjar will be Verstappen's eighth team mate in F1 – but how will he stack up compared to those who held the role before him? An all-rookie line-up joined Toro Rosso in 2015, consisting of Verstappen – who became the youngest driver to make their F1 debut, at 17 years and 164 days old – and Carlos Sainz. The latter made an early impression by scoring points in his first race, while Verstappen was forced to retire with an engine failure. Sainz suffered more mechanically-related retirements – particularly during the middle of the campaign – and Verstappen ultimately ended 2015 with more points. It would turn out to be a much shorter tenure as team mates for Verstappen and Sainz in 2016, with Verstappen promoted to the main Red Bull outfit after just four races. Verstappen just beat Sainz in terms of points finishes on three to two, while both drivers suffered a DNF due to a technical issue. A new era unfolded for Verstappen when he made the step up to Red Bull just a few races into his sophomore season, with the Dutchman partnering Daniel Ricciardo while Daniil Kvyat was sent back to the Toro Rosso outfit. Ricciardo again led the way in terms of points scored, but Verstappen got the better of his team mate in the Qualifying and race day head-to-heads as he continued to hone his skills. On the other side of the garage, Verstappen collected 11 rostrums and outscored his team mate on most counts, though the Dutchman was still yet to claim a pole position while Ricciardo had also suffered more mechanically-related DNFs. Both drivers failed to finish in Bahrain and Azerbaijan, the latter being due to an infamous collision between the Red Bull cars. Following Ricciardo's exit, Red Bull opted to promote Pierre Gasly from Toro Rosso, making the Frenchman Verstappen's third F1 team mate. This would not be enough to keep his place at the team, however, and Gasly was sent back to Toro Rosso for the remainder of the season after Round 12 in Hungary. Alex Albon became the next to step up to Red Bull, the Thai driver swapping places with Gasly and enjoying a solid run in his nine races alongside Verstappen in 2019. An impressive record saw Albon collect points in every race – with the only exception being Brazil, where he had looked on course for his debut podium before dropping down the order after contact with Lewis Hamilton – and his performances sealed his place at the Milton Keynes-based outfit for 2020. While Albon came away with his maiden podium at Mugello – as well as scoring a second in Bahrain – Red Bull again decided to make a change to their line-up, resulting in the Thai racer becoming a test and reserve driver for the squad in 2021. Though the Mexican could not prove a match for Verstappen, he fulfilled a solid supporting role in a season remembered for the tense title battle that played out between Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton. During the summer, it was confirmed that Perez would remain a Red Bull driver in 2022. After a nightmare first race in which both drivers retired with the same mechanical issue, Red Bull quickly bounced back and went on to enjoy an increasingly dominant campaign in 2022. The Drivers' Championship was claimed by Verstappen with four races to spare, while Perez built further on his 2021 season by doubling his number of podiums and wins, as well as taking a debut pole position. The statistics from Verstappen's side in 2023 make for astonishing reading, with the Dutch driver scoring a record-breaking 19 wins out of 22 races en route to his most assured title yet. Despite the challenges, Verstappen held on to clinch his fourth title – but it was a nightmare campaign for Perez, the Mexican failing to stand on the podium again after Round 5 in China. Red Bull slipped backwards from first to third in the Teams' Championship, and it was announced after the season had concluded that the team and Perez had agreed to part ways with immediate effect. While Lawson returned to Racing Bulls, a direct swap saw Yuki Tsunoda become the next to pit himself against Verstappen at Red Bull. Throughout their 22 races together, Verstappen beat Tsunoda in both head-to-heads – with Tsunoda's only better finish being in Austria, a race that Verstappen retired from on Lap 1 – and ended the season a whopping 15 places ahead in the Drivers' Championship. Prior to the campaign finale in Abu Dhabi, it was announced that Tsunoda would move to a test and reserve role in 2026.</p>
