                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Bill Clinton, left, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton listen as Vice President Kamala Harris delivers a eulogy for U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, Aug. 1, 2024, in Houston. Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton listen during the state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter at Washington National Cathedral in Washington, Jan. 9, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican chair of a House Committee rejected an offer Monday from former President Bill Clinton to conduct a transcribed interview for a House investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, pushing the threat to hold both Clintons in contempt of Congress closer towards a vote. If passed, the charges threaten both Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with substantial fines and even incarceration if they are convicted. A letter from the committee to attorneys for the Clintons indicates that they had offered for Bill Clinton to conduct a 4-hour transcribed interview on “matters related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein” and for Hillary Clinton to submit a sworn declaration. “The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,” Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said. The Republican-controlled Oversight panel advanced criminal contempt of Congress charges last month. Nine of the committee's 21 Democrats joined Republicans in support of the charges against Bill Clinton as they argued for full transparency in the Epstein investigation. Three Democrats also supported advancing the charges against Hillary Clinton. Bill Clinton's relationship with Epstein has re-emerged as a focal point for Republicans amid the push for a reckoning over Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 in a New York jail cell as he faced sex trafficking charges. Clinton, like a bevy of other high-powered men, had a well-documented relationship with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He has not been accused of wrongdoing in his interactions with the late financier. However, as Comer threatened to begin contempt of Congress proceedings, they started negotiating towards a compromise. Still, the Clintons remained highly critical of Comer's decision, saying that he was bringing politics into the investigation while failing to hold the Trump administration accountable for delays in producing the Department of Justice's case files on Epstein.</p>

Since his return to office, President Donald Trump has undertaken a series of changes aimed at reshaping the look and feel of the White House and other iconic Washington landmarks. He said the decision followed a yearlong review involving contractors, arts experts and other advisers. He added that the temporary closure would allow the renovations to be completed faster and at a higher quality than if construction were carried out while performances continued. It was not immediately clear what renovations were planned, how much it would cost and what would happen to the scheduled performances. Read on to learn more about how the world's most famous real estate developer is leaving his mark on Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump holds a model of an arch as he delivers remarks during a ballroom fundraising dinner in the East Room of the White House. In October, Trump unveiled a new monument dubbed the "Arc de Trump," which is planned to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary next year. At a White House ballroom fundraising dinner, Trump shared additional details about the newest monument planned for the nation's capital. He said he was presented with three arch models in varying sizes — small, medium and large — and said his preference was for the largest one. President Donald Trump said he preferred the largest model arch. Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office. Trump's taste for opulence is unmistakable in the Oval Office, where golden accents now decorate the nation's most iconic workspace, a reflection of his personal style. Last March, Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham during a tour of the Oval Office that the room "needed a little life" when asked about the gold details. President Donald Trump meets with European leaders following a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Aug. 18, 2025, in the Oval Office. "Throughout the years, people have tried to come up with a gold paint that would look like gold, and they've never been able to do it," Trump told Ingraham. A golden cherub is seen above a door in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on May 5, 2025. White House spokesperson Davis Ingle previously told Fox News Digital that the gold Trump added to the Oval Office "is of the highest quality," declining to provide further details. The spokesperson also said that Trump personally covered the cost of the gold accents, though they did not specify how much gold was added or how much Trump spent.

President Donald Trump added plaques below former President Joe Biden's portrait in the "Presidential Walk of Fame." President Donald Trump announced new renovations to the Lincoln Bathroom through a post on Truth Social. It was renovated in the 1940s in an Art Deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era," Trump wrote in an Oct. 31 Truth Social post. A photo shared on President Donald Trump's Truth Social account of a renovated White House bathroom. "I did it in black and white polished statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and in fact could be the marble that was originally there," he added. President Donald Trump announced new renovations to the Lincoln Bathroom through a post on his social media platform, Truth Social. Among the largest projects currently underway is a 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom designed to accommodate roughly 650 seated guests. On July 31, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the planned construction of the sprawling ballroom. "The White House is currently unable to host major functions honoring world leaders in other countries without having to install a large and unsightly tent approximately 100 yards away from the main building's entrance," Leavitt said during a press briefing, adding the new ballroom will be "a much-needed and exquisite addition." Construction has already begun on the White House grounds, and the estimated cost is north of $200 million and will be financed by Trump and private donors. Ahead of Independence Day, Trump also personally financed the installation of two 88-foot flagpoles with American flags in front of and behind the White House, each reportedly costing around $50,000. President Donald Trump watched as the flag poles and flags were raised on June 18. Trump ordered updates to the Rose Garden in March. Elsewhere on the White House grounds, Trump directed the addition of stone pavers to the Rose Garden lawn, a change designed to better accommodate press conferences and ceremonial events. Framed by magnolia and crabapple trees, the Rose Garden has hosted everything from diplomatic welcomes to first lady initiatives.

An Arizona college student is dead, and three others have been arrested after attending an off-campus fraternity event last weekend. Officers were called to the scene at around 8:45 a.m. on Saturday, Jan. 31, after receiving reports of an 18-year-old male student of Northern Arizona University (NAU) who was "found unresponsive" at a house on South Pine Grove Road in Flagstaff, the Flagstaff Police Department said in a statement. "Upon arrival, officers found the individual not breathing and continued life-saving measures on scene until paramedics arrived." The student, whose identity has not been released at the time of this report, was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene, according to authorities. An 18-year-old Northern Arizona University student was found dead at an off-campus Delta Tau Delta fraternity event, leading to the arrest of three members, in Flagstaff, Arizona on Saturday, Jan. 31, 2026, according to authorities. The incident led to the arrest of three Delta Tau Delta fraternity members, according to police. Twenty-year-old students Carter Eslick, Riley Cass and Ryan Creech were each taken into custody and charged with hazing in connection with the student's death, FPD said in the statement. Students walk along a sun-dappled pedestrian pathway on the Northern Arizona University campus in Flagstaff on Sept. 10, 2025. Hazing is defined, in part, as the "submission of members or prospective members to potentially dangerous or hazardous circumstances or activities" that may result in personal injury, according to NAU. Detectives are still working to determine the student's manner and cause of death, the FPD said. In a statement, NAU called the student's death a "devastating loss," while adding that "our hearts are with his family, friends and all members of our community who are grieving." Students walk along a pedestrian pathway on the Northern Arizona University campus in Flagstaff on Sept. 10, 2025. The university also acknowledged the arrest of three of its students and revealed the campus' Delta Tau Delta fraternity chapter has been suspended "to allow a full investigation to take place and prioritize student safety." "We want to be clear: The safety and well-being of our students remain our highest priorities. Violence, hazing or any other behavior that endangers others has no place at NAU," the university added. The FPD, Delta Tau Delta's national chapter and NAU did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' for the annual Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania Democrats and Republicans are finding rare common ground — defending Punxsutawney Phil from animal rights activists. Josh Shapiro (D) and GOP lawmakers are jointly rejecting pressure from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to retire the famed groundhog after he predicted six more weeks of winter on Monday. Shapiro amplified the moment on social media by posting an image of a yellow Gadsden flag — a symbol associated with conservative politics and the 2010s Tea Party movement — but with the typical snake replaced by a groundhog. Dereume holds Punxsutawney Phil, the weather prognosticating groundhog, during the 140th celebration of Groundhog Day on Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa., Monday, Feb. 2, 2026. Phil's handlers said the groundhog forecast six more weeks of winter. Meanwhile, the leader of the Pennsylvania House Republican caucus told Fox News Digital that PETA's latest idea, to replace Phil with a groundhog hologram, is off base. Punxsutawney Phil and the celebration of Groundhog Day are core parts of what it means to be Pennsylvanian and are cherished by the nation," said House Minority Leader Jesse Topper of Bedford. "On top of that, Phil is treated like royalty, and rightfully so," Topper said, referencing his spacious library digs that also include a large window allowing sunlight and the smiles of passersby. "It sounds like it is time PETA be forcibly retired from bad takes and outlandish viewpoints." Dereume holds Punxsutawney Phil, the weather prognosticating groundhog, during the 137th celebration of Groundhog Day on Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa., Feb. 2, 2023. Pennsylvania Deputy Tourism Secretary Anne Ryan said in a statement that Punxsutawney Phil "draws national and international attention" to Pennsylvania every year. "Six more weeks of winter means more time to enjoy everything that makes this season special — from skiing and snowboarding to cozy small towns, historic sites, and festive winter events," Ryan said, alluding to the commonwealth's latest tourism slogan, "The Great American Getaway." Punxsutawney Phil lives with his wife Phyllis and their young kit at the Jefferson County Library in downtown Punxsutawney, halfway between Altoona and Erie. The famed groundhog's support extends well beyond his burrow. Across Pennsylvania's historically German regions, including the Lehigh Valley and Dutch Country, Groundhog Day is marked by feasts hosted by more than a dozen "Grundsau Lodsch," or Groundhog Lodges, featuring traditional food, music and weather forecasts delivered in the Pennsylfaanisch dialect.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Friday said in a news conference about the citys universal pre- and 3-K programs that it is open to all New Yorkers, regardless of immigration status. Socialist New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani has outlined plans to scale back the city's Gifted and Talented program, prompting some education experts to warn that doing so could deprive high-achieving students, particularly those from low-income families, of critical academic opportunities. Recent media reports indicate that Mamdani, who took office in January, intends to end the city's Gifted and Talented program for kindergarten students and delay entry until third grade, a move critics argue would amount to a major weakening of accelerated learning options in the nation's largest school district. The plan is drawing sharp criticism from Defending Education, a national education watchdog group that previously fought, and won, a years-long legal battle to preserve New York's gifted programs after it was argued that the admissions system had discriminatory effects and reinforced racial inequities in education. "The Court of Appeals rightly concluded that the role of the judiciary is not to make education policy," Sarah Parshall Perry, vice president and legal fellow at Defending Education, told Fox News Digital, adding that the program complied with state education law and equal protection requirements. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani plans to end the city's Gifted and Talented program for kindergarten students and delay entry until third grade. But Perry warned that Mamdani's policy agenda could undo what the courts upheld. "As we suspected he might, newly minted democratic socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani — himself, a product of expensive private schools — has pledged to shut down the gifted and talented program, despite the fact that it has helped countless students from humble backgrounds achieve their full academic potential," Perry told Fox News Digital. "Depriving kids of much-needed advanced learning opportunities is not only foolhardy, but it's also the height of hypocrisy coming from someone who was born into affluence and attended costly private schools. Apparently, Mamdani believes only the privileged should have access to various educational opportunities." Mamdani has argued that early gifted testing contributes to inequities in the school system, though critics counter that dismantling selective programs does little to improve outcomes for struggling students while actively harming high performers. Paul Runko, senior director of strategic initiatives for K-12 programs at Defending Education, echoed Perry's concerns, emphasizing the impact such changes could have on working-class families. "On behalf of parents who simply want the best possible education for their children, Defending Education spent years in court fighting to preserve New York City's gifted and talented programs against efforts to use the courts to inject race into every aspect of the school system," Runko said. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani was elected in November 2025 and sworn in as the city's first socialist mayor on Jan. 1, 2026. "Those efforts may succeed if Mayor Zohran Mamdani moves forward with eliminating these accelerated learning opportunities," he warned. "Students, particularly those from lower-income families who benefit from NYC's gifted and talented programs, deserve opportunities for academic excellence, not a one-size-fits-all approach that could weaken learning for all students." Mamdani's office pushed back on Defending Education's characterization, telling Fox News Digital that the administration opposes testing five-year-olds for gifted and talented programs but is not eliminating advanced learning opportunities across all grade levels. Mamdani's office said the focus is instead on reshaping the public school system to provide "rigorous" instruction for all students, rather than separating children at an early age. Mamdani faced heated criticism from his opponents in the mayoral race regarding his plans to change the program, as well as from the Washington Post editorial board in October. "Who could have guessed that Zohran Mamdani (D), the leading candidate to become the next New York mayor, would provoke a firestorm by announcing this week that he intends to phase out the city's early elementary school programs for gifted students in the name of equity? Parents of bright children want access to schooling that meets their needs?" Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by LSEG. A Russian cargo plane typically used to transfer military equipment landed at a military airfield in Havana Sunday night, echoing flight patterns seen ahead of the capture of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. The U.S.-sanctioned Ilyushin Il-76, operated by Russian state-linked airline Aviacon Zitotrans, was tracked landing at San Antonio de los Baños Airfield, a Cuban military installation roughly 30 miles south of Havana, according to public flight data. Flight-tracking records show the aircraft stopped in St. Petersburg and Sochi in Russia; Mauritania, Africa; and the Dominican Republic. Each landing would have required approval from host governments, offering a window into which countries are continuing to permit Russian military-linked aviation activity despite Western sanctions. The same aircraft conducted flights to Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba in late October 2025, as tensions between Washington and Caracas escalated. That movement preceded U.S. military action in Venezuela that ultimately ended Maduro's rule — a sequence U.S. officials and analysts have since pointed to as a warning indicator when evaluating similar Russian aviation activity in the region. A Russian military Ilyushin Il-76 landed in Cuba Sunday night. Now, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel finds himself under mounting pressure from President Donald Trump, who has sharply intensified U.S. policy toward Havana in recent weeks. On Thursday, Trump declared a national emergency related to Cuba, asserting that the Cuban government poses an "unusual and extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The administration also said it would impose penalties on any country that sells or supplies oil to Cuba without U.S. authorization. Trump confirmed Sunday that the U.S. is engaged in direct talks with Cuban officials. "So we're talking to the people from Cuba, the highest people in Cuba, to see what happens. I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba." Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have both indicated support for political change in Havana, though the administration has not said whether it would pursue that objective through military action. The same Russian aircraft flew into Caracas before Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was captured by U.S. forces. Russian military ties to Cuba have repeatedly triggered concern in Washington. U.S. officials have warned that renewed Russian activity in Cuba could pose security risks close to the U.S. mainland. The Il-76 is a heavy transport aircraft capable of carrying roughly 50 tons of cargo or up to 200 personnel, a capability that has drawn scrutiny given the operator's history. Aviacon Zitotrans has been sanctioned by the United States, Canada and Ukraine for supporting Russia's defense sector. "Aviacon Zitotrans has shipped military equipment such as rockets, warheads, and helicopter parts all over the world," the U.S. Treasury Department said in January 2023, when it added the airline to its sanctions list. It remains unclear what cargo the aircraft carried on its most recent flight. During earlier operations in Venezuela, Russian state media and a Russian lawmaker said the same aircraft delivered Pantsir-S1 short-range and Buk-M2E medium-range air defense systems to Caracas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — Wild swings that swept through financial markets overnight eased as trading headed westward to Wall Street on Monday. U.S. stocks rose following sharp drops in Asia and then gains in Europe, while gold and silver prices rallied back from severe earlier losses. The S&P 500 added 0.6% and is on track to snap a three-day losing streak. Stocks of companies that make computer storage helped lead the market, adding to gains from last week following several profit reports that topped analysts' expectations. Airlines and cruise-ship operators were also strong, benefiting from a sharp easing of oil prices. The center of the action in financial markets was again precious metals, where momentum has suddenly halted after gold's price had roughly doubled in just 12 months. Gold briefly dropped below $4,500 per ounce in the overnight hours, down more than $1,000 from its high point reached just last week. It later erased its loss since Friday, before pulling back to $4,730.50, down 0.3%. Silver's price has been on an even wilder ride recently, and it swung from a 9% loss overnight to a gain of 1.2%. Gold and silver prices had been surging as investors looked for safer things to own amid a wide range of worries, including a Federal Reserve that may be set to become less independent, a U.S. stock market that critics say is expensive, threats of tariffs and heavy debt loads for governments worldwide. Their prices cratered on Friday, including a 31.4% plunge for silver. Warsh's reputation as a former Fed governor may have raised expectations among some investors that he may keep interest rates high to fight against inflation, which would reduce the need to hide out in gold and silver for protection. But many on Wall Street are also skeptical of that initial reading and say the expectation from Trump is likely that Warsh will cut interest rates, something the president has been demanding. That could give the economy a boost, but also inflation. That affects prices for all kinds of investments, as the Fed tries to keep the U.S. job market humming without letting inflation get out of control. On Wall Street, Sandisk leaped 15% to lead the S&P 500. It credited demand created by the artificial-intelligence boom, among other things. That helped offset a 1.1% drop for Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world's move into AI technology. The losses were worse in Asia, where AI winners plunged. It warned of challenges keeping international visitors away from its U.S. theme parks, among other things. Oil prices dropped more than 4% after Trump told reporters that Iran is “seriously talking to us.” It's a potential signal of improving relations between the two countries, which could prevent a possible disruption to the global flow of oil. That could mean less painful fuel bills for airlines and cruise ships. In the bond market, Treasury yields edged higher after a report said that U.S. manufacturing grew last month, when economists were expecting a contraction. In stock markets abroad, European indexes rose roughly 1% following Asia's washout. AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.</p>

(AP Photo/Dwayne Newton, File) The handlers of a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil at Gobbler's Knob in western Pennsylvania announced that he saw his own shadow Monday morning, thereby predicting six more weeks of winter and not an early spring. And in eastern and central Pennsylvania, where people of German descent have been watching the groundhog's annual emergence from hibernation for centuries, there's a tradition of groundhog clubs and celebrations that are independent of Phil. Some dismiss the Punxsutawney event held every Feb. 2 as an unworthy rival to their own festivities, which they say forecast more accurate weather predictions. “We know this is silly; we know this is fun,” said Marcy Galando, executive director of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. “We want people to come here with a sense of humor.” What the Celts called Imbolc is also around when Christians celebrate Candlemas, timed to Joseph and Mary's presentation of Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem. Ancient people would watch the sun, stars and animal behavior to guide farming practices and other decisions, and the practice of watching an animal's emergence from winter hibernation to forecast weather has roots in a similar German tradition involving badgers or bears. Historians have found a reference in an 1841 diary to groundhog weather forecasts in early February among families of German descent in Morgantown, Pennsylvania, according to the late Don Yoder, a University of Pennsylvania professor whose book about Groundhog Day explored the Celtic connection. Yoder concluded the festival has roots in “ancient, undoubtedly prehistoric, weather lore.” Punxsutawney is an area that Pennsylvania Germans settled — and in the late 1880s started celebrating the holiday by picnicking, hunting and eating groundhogs. The Bill Murray movie caused such a resurgence of interest that two years after it came out, event organizers voiced concern about rowdy crowds drinking all night, people climbing trees and others stripping to their underwear. Alcohol is now prohibited at Gobbler's Knob, Phil's spot some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. Quarryville lodge board chair Charlie Hart credits Orphie as a far better forecaster than Phil. “Octoraro Orphie has never been wrong,” he claimed. Their lifespan in the wild is typically two or three years. The Pennsylvania Game Commission says tens of thousands of hunters take more than 200,000 groundhogs in a year. Game Commission spokesperson Travis Lau found groundhog a bit stinky to clean, with thick skin. “It was actually really good, no doubt about it — and to my taste, more like beef than venison is,” Lau said. They were social clubs with similarities to Freemasonry. Intended to preserve Pennsylvania German culture and traditions, clubs would sometimes fine those who were caught speaking anything but their Pennsylvania Dutch language at meetings. A dozen or more such clubs remain active. They all share the unifying feature of a groundhog's weather prognostication, said William W. Donner, a Kutztown University anthropology professor who has written about efforts to preserve German heritage. “I think it's just one of these traditional rituals that people enjoy participating in, that maybe take them away from modern life for 15 minutes,” Donner said. Some well-meaning efforts have sought to determine Phil's accuracy, but what “six weeks of winter” means is debatable. Claims that a groundhog has or has not seen its shadow — and that it's able to communicate that to a human — are also fair territory for skeptics and the humor-impaired. The science behind whether they can make any accurate weather predictions is problematic at best. The government agency has compared Phil's record with U.S. national temperatures and concluded he was right only three of the past 10 years.</p>

You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here. The Justice Department under President Donald Trump promised to quell unrest led by anti-immigration enforcement agitators in Minnesota and prosecute massive fraud. While the department has succeeded with a recent slate of protest-related arrests and obstruction charges related to violence against federal agents conducting immigration enforcement operations, the last federal action against fraud in the state was announced in mid-December 2025, prior to a viral video that elevated national attention on alleged schemes linked to the Somali community. And as independent journalists uncover large networks of encrypted group chats fueling the agitators that harass federal agents on the ground, FBI leadership has made no show of force other than stated commitments to investigate those networks. Some law enforcement operations have been more streamlined than others. Incidents such as protest-related prosecutions can be pinpointed and charged with more speed and efficiency, while large-scale financial prosecutions often depend on experienced trial teams that the Minnesota federal prosecutor's office no longer has fully in place. Still, the threat of additional departures from career personnel looms large. Former federal prosecutor and University of St. Thomas law professor Mark Osler said the recent departures have left fraud cases especially vulnerable. Colin is a rockstar, who was instrumental in our team's mission of Making America Safe Again. McDonald's role is designed to centralize and coordinate fraud prosecutions nationwide, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said McDonald was “instrumental” in the DOJ's broader crime-fighting efforts. The announcement followed weeks of heightened attention on Minnesota after independent journalist Nick Shirley released viral reporting in December alleging widespread abuse in the state's child care and social services systems. Shirley went to dozens of businesses that exhibited suspicious qualities and raised questions about possibly fraudulent activity. Since his reporting, however, no major Minnesota-based federal fraud indictments have been announced, even as administration officials and lawmakers have cited estimates suggesting more than $9 billion billed across 14 Medicaid services. To the administration's credit, there have been other recent fraud busts uncovered in recent days, including the arrest of a Los Angeles man who was accused on Jan. 23 of obtaining $23 million in public money intended to combat homelessness and pocketing $10 million. On the state level, there has been at least one charging decision against Mohamed Abdirashid Omarxeyd, who is accused of defrauding the Minnesota Medical Assistance program out of more than $3 million. Omarxeyd also faces parallel federal charges stemming from a December indictment. Osler pointed to the state's long-running $250 million Feeding Our Future fraud prosecution as a clear example of why staffing losses matter. “That was a serious, serious fraud that needs to be taken seriously — and they did, and they are,” Osler said. “But an ongoing part of it is seeking restitution, trying to get the money back. “You're going along through a difficult section, and your teacher gets sick, and then one day you get a substitute.” Minnesota federal prosecutors last announced major fraud charges in mid-December, accusing six defendants, including Omarxeyd, of defrauding autism and housing stability programs. However, court records show the case has already suffered from delays, with Omarxeyd's initial appearance pushed back three times from an initial Jan. 12 appearance, to now a March 2 hearing. The staffing dilemma has surfaced in other recent court cases involving major Minnesota fraud schemes. Buzicky cited new responsibilities stemming from “changes in office staffing,” and a judge granted the request, according to court filings. When the Washington Examiner contacted the U.S. attorney's office on Jan. 20 seeking comment on the status of fraud investigations, an automated email stated it was “currently without a public information officer” and that responses may be delayed. Osler said such abrupt departures for federal prosecutors are rarely ideological, though a recent report from CNN indicated the earlier wave of resignations was spurred in part by the DOJ's response to a federal officer's shooting of Renee Good on Jan. 7, in which senior officials pushed career staff to investigate the actions of her widow in and around the time of Good's death. “I don't know any of their individual reasons for leaving,” Osler said. As of this month, USAJobs.gov lists openings for both a criminal assistant U.S. attorney and a civil assistant U.S. attorney in the District of Minnesota. Miller's post was responding to another sent hours before by Bondi's former chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, who left the department in September. Bondi's former right-hand man more specifically called for applicants who “support President Trump and anti-crime agenda.” If you are a lawyer, are interested in being an AUSA, and support President Trump and anti-crime agenda, DM me. Now is your chance to join the mission and do good for our country. Now is your chance to join the mission and do good for our country.” Tim Walz (D-MN), who has been accused by Republicans of mishandling state resources that led to widespread schemes in his state, publicly acknowledged the staffing problem in the federal prosecutor's office during a recent appearance on Pod Save America, arguing it has disrupted fraud enforcement. “This fraud thing happens in every state,” Walz said. I don't even know who over there is working on fraud.” Walz said state officials had been cooperating with federal prosecutors before the departures, underscoring how much of the current pace stems from personnel upheaval rather than a lack of investigative leads. Department of Homeland Security officials have also emphasized investigations into organized efforts to obstruct immigration enforcement. One day later, the department was able to secure charges against additional defendants related to the Cities Church disruption on Jan. 18, including journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort, who participated in joining their protest in an act DOJ officials said amounted to a conspiracy against the rights of parishioners and FACE Act violations. Meanwhile, FBI Director Kash Patel acknowledged this week that the bureau opened an investigation into Signal chat groups only after conservative journalist Cam Higby infiltrated and publicized them. The revelation of the chat, whose members included elected officials and an ally of the Democratic governor, has prompted calls by Trump supporters to prosecute members responsible for coordinating harassment campaigns against federal agents. “I'm not going to say a lot about that because I don't want to show our hand,” Homan said. “We need to target these groups,” Perez told the National News Desk. We need to find out exactly where this is being orchestrated from — who's behind it.” Aaron Terr, director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, told Reason this week there might not be “any lawful basis for this investigation.” The pressure over fraud allegations is set to intensify next month, when Walz and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison are scheduled to testify under oath before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. “That kind of coordination can certainly help,” Osler said. Still, he cautioned that even with a centralized fraud chief in place, it may not be enough to overcome the short term to alleviate the immediate problems of losing personnel who have spent years in the U.S. attorney's office.</p>

Host Trevor Noah speaks during the 68th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday, Feb. 1, 2026, in Los Angeles. “ Nicki Minaj is not here,” Noah said, to big cheers from the audience at Crypto.com Arena. “She is still at the White House with Donald Trump discussing very important issues.” Minaj this week visited and praised the president, the culmination of a move toward MAGA that she's made in recent months. There was no mention of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (on a night when many attendees were wearing “ICE OUT” buttons). After the show in a Truth Social post, Trump reacted. “Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory, statement, have never been accused being there, not even by the Fake News Media,” the post said. It looks like I'll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C.” It had seemed at first like he wasn't going to go very far into such material. “Do you understand how long ago that is?” he said. “Back in 1999, the president had had a sex scandal, people thought computers were about to destroy the world, and Diddy was arrested.” “I actually thought about writing a few jokes roasting you, but then I remembered what you can do to light-skinned dudes from other countries,” Noah, who is from South Africa, said in a reference to Lamar's beef with the Canadian rapper Drake that culminated in last year's big Grammy winner “Not Like Us.” Later, he sat with Bad Bunny, and asked if he could come live with him in his native Puerto Rico if things got too bad in the U.S. “Trevor I have some news for you,” Bad Bunny said. The Recording Academy announced less than three weeks ago that Noah was returning “one final time.” “I believe in term limits,” Noah said during the show. Noah himself is a four-time Grammy nominee, and was up this year in the best audio book recording category for “Into The Uncut Grass,” a children's story. This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Nicki Minaj in several places. For more coverage of the 2026 Grammy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/grammy-awards</p>

Kehlani arrives at the 68th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday, Feb. 1, 2026, in Los Angeles. Billie Eilish arrives at the 68th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday, Feb. 1, 2026, in Los Angeles. Entertainment's awards season has coincided with the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign in Minneapolis, forcing artists to decide whether and how to join the growing cultural revolt against immigration crackdowns. Billie Eilish, Finneas and Carole King wore pins while appearing onstage. Even Justin and Hailey Bieber, who don't normally address American politics, had them. Eilish began her song of the year speech by professing that “no one is illegal on stolen land.” British soul pop singer Olivia Dean, recognized as best new artist, shared that she is the granddaughter of an immigrant — people who she said “deserve to be celebrated.” Expletives flew as ICE got cursed multiple times by winners including Kehlani. “Before I say thanks to God, I'm gonna say: ICE out,” Bad Bunny said to great applause while accepting the award for best música urbana album. The frequent pushback and buttons' prevalence marked a much stronger showing of support than organizers saw at last month's Golden Globes. Public backlash has grown since a Border Patrol officer shot and killed 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti and federal agents detained 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos. Plus, as one organizer noted, the Grammys tend to draw a less risk-averse crowd than Hollywood's shows. “These are folks who are known for six-stage shows, crazy costumes, being kind of rebellious, punk rock — like that's the music industry. And so, I think it makes sense that we would see good support,” Maremoto Executive Director Jess Morales Rocketto said ahead of the show. “These pins are about so much more than a red carpet moment. It's about people taking a stand and doing what they can to show up to say that ICE should be out of our communities.” Jason Isbell, Margo Price, Kehlani and Rhiannon Giddens were among the other artists wearing protest apparel on the Grammys red carpet. Justin Vernon, whose band Bon Iver is up for best alternative music album, said he wore a whistle to honor the legal observers who are documenting federal agents' actions on the streets. “I think there's a reason that music exists and it's to heal and to bring people together,” he told The Associated Press. And at the Sundance Film Festival, several celebrities wore pins saying “ICE OUT” during their red carpet appearances, including Natalie Portman, Olivia Wilde and Zoey Deutch, who also wore a “BE GOOD” pin, referencing Renee Good, who was killed by an ICE officer last month. Wilde told the AP that she was “horrified by this string of murders that we are somehow legitimizing and normalizing.” And if we can do anything with our platforms, you know, we can speak out and demand that ICE get out.” Portman got emotional when asked about her “ICE OUT” pin at the premiere of her new film, “The Gallerist.” It's beautiful,” the actor said as she teared up. She described a range of industry forces working against artists' political expression. Objections could come from record companies, managers or corporate partners. “There's like a million reasons for people not to do it.” “I wouldn't be surprised if we see some Latino artists wearing them,” she said of the pins. “But the reality is that just because Latino artists are rich and famous, doesn't mean that they are exempt from the lack of safety that permeates so many Latinos and Latino families.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Australian snowboarder has died on a trip with friends to Japan after her backpack became caught in a ski lift leaving her suspended in midair, according to Japanese police and the lift operator. Nagano Omachi Police said the 22-year-old tourist suffered from cardiac arrest after the accident on Friday at the Tsugaike Mountain Resort in Hakuba Valley, a popular ski destination in central Japan. The woman was rushed to a hospital but later succumbed to her injuries, according to police and the ski lift operator. “A staff member immediately pressed the emergency stop button to halt lift operations. Emergency assistance was promptly provided, and the guest was then transported to a hospital by ambulance,” the statement said. The company expressed its “deepest condolences to the bereaved family” and vowed to strengthen safety measures. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that an Australian citizen had died in Japan, and said it was providing consular support to their family. “We send our deepest condolences to the family at this difficult time,” a department spokesperson said in a statement. Japan is considered one of Asia's top snow sports destinations due to its powder snow, which attracts a large number of foreign tourists each winter. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.
