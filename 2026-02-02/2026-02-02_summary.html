Days before Schumer's remarks, the Trump administration bypassed Congress to approve a $7 billion arms sale to Israel.

Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York) said on Sunday that one of his most important jobs as Senate minority leader is to “fight for aid to Israel,” as the Trump administration's masked federal agents continue their deadly raids of the U.S. with little to no pushback from Democrats.

In remarks at a breakfast gathering of Jewish leaders in New York City, Schumer said, “I have many jobs as leader … and one is to fight for aid to Israel, all the aid that Israel needs.” Part of the remarks at the ​​UJA-Federation of New York gathering were posted online by The Forward reporter Jacob Kornbluh. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) also spoke at the event.

Schumer went on to brag that the U.S. has sent Israel more military funding under his leadership “than ever, ever before,” referring to “many” threats that Israel faces in the region that Schumer does not specify. 

The remark came a day after Israel killed at least 31 Palestinians, including six children, in an airstrike in Gaza, in its latest major violation of the ceasefire agreement.

“As long as I'm in the Senate, this program will continue to grow from strength to strength, and we won't let anyone attack it or undo it,” Schumer said, referring to aid for Israel as his “baby.” 

Implicit in that remark is denigration of those within his own caucus, like Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), who have previously backed legislation to block aid to Israel as it's committed genocide in the Gaza Strip.

On Israel, Schumer is seemingly aligned with the Trump administration. On Friday, the State Department approved nearly $7 billion in weapons sales for Israel, including 30 Apache attack helicopters and equipment for other vehicles — despite the “ceasefire” deal underway in Gaza and no other active wars with Israel ongoing. 

Lawmakers said that the State Department once again bypassed Congress in order to approve the sale. The House Foreign Affairs Committee's top Democrat, Gregory Meeks (D-New York), condemned the sale in a statement.

“Just one hour before doing so, the Trump Administration informed me it would disregard Congressional oversight and years of standing practice, and immediately notify over $6 billion dollars in arms sales to Israel. This is yet another repudiation by Donald Trump of Congress' Constitutional oversight role,” said Meeks.

Meeks said that the Trump administration has “refused” to provide any senior administration officials for a briefing on the sale, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio has “failed to provide any justification or documentation for bypassing” review for the sale.

In other words, the Trump administration approved a sale of arms to Israel likely completely without the aid of Schumer.

At the same time, Schumer is already facing criticism for his lack of energy in leading Democrats against Trump's immigration raids. Schumer's comments on Israel came just eight days after a Customs and Border Protection agent and a Border Patrol agent shot and killed Alex Pretti, and amidst near-daily news of violence and horrific deportations by immigration agents, who have been likened to the Gestapo by critics. 

Just days before, Schumer had struck a deal with the White House to help avoid a prolonged government shutdown, funding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for two weeks while negotiations on his demands are ongoing. His list of demands, including ensuring immigration agents aren't allowed to wear masks, does not include a decrease in the proposed budget for the agency.“

This is another reason I will be voting no on the Senate amended appropriations bill which includes ‘more security assistance to Israel … than ever, ever before,'” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) in response to Schumer's remarks on social media. “No House Democrat should vote yes on a bill that leaves in place triple ICE funding and massive aid to Israel.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            “Saturday Night Live” this weekend featured one of its best political sketches in years. It's about a mother who dramatically reveals to her children that she's having sudden reservations about President Donald Trump.
    


            If you haven't, you should watch it.
    


            And the satire has bipartisan bite. The right can enjoy the insufferable liberal adult children marring their mom's moment of vulnerability with their apoplectic I-told-you-sos. The left can enjoy the caricature of someone they've long anticipated would one day arrive in droves: The regretful Trump voter, finally starting to come to her senses.
    


            But how much does this mother reflect reality?
    


            It certainly appears that more and more Trump voters are coming to a similarly skeptical place.
    


            At the same time, it's not clear how many of them were truly MAGA to begin with. And they generally express their emotions more subtly than the full-on regret that Trump's critics have long sought.
    


            A number of polls have gotten at this question in recent weeks.
    


            A Pew Research Center poll, for one, suggested significant erosion in Trump's support on the right.
    


            The survey showed 20% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said the Trump administration has been “worse than expected.”
    


            Perhaps more strikingly, it showed the percentage of these voters who said they support “all” or “most” of Trump's policies dropping from 67% in February 2025 to 56% in late January.
    


Fox News and New York Times-Siena College polls both recently broke out data on 2024 Trump voters, and the detractors were in many cases significant.
    


            In the Fox poll, 16% of Trump voters said they disapproved of his job performance as president.
    


            But it got worse from there. The survey also tested a dozen specific issues, and on 10 of the 12 – everything except border security and immigration – Trump's disapproval rating among his 2024 voters was north of 20%. It was at least 25% on half of those issues.
    


            That's significant to have 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 Trump voters so consistently on a different page than the president.
    


            The Times-Siena poll showed a slightly smaller 12% of 2024 Trump voters disapproving of his job performance overall.
    


            But again, other data points were worse for him:
    


            What does all of that tell us? It suggests people might be understandably reluctant to say they disapprove of Trump when you asked for a straight up-or-down verdict. But the disapproval shows up more when you dig a little deeper and ask about specific things.
    


            And that tracks with what we've seen before when it comes to the more specific subject of Trump voter “regret.”
    


            We unfortunately don't have good recent, high-quality data on Trump voter regret. The last survey to test this was an October Washington Post-Ipsos survey. It showed 7% of Trump voters said they regretted supporting Trump – compared to 3% of Kamala Harris supporters.
    


            Seven percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a decent-sized chunk. And 19% of non-White Trump voters expressed regret.
    


            The previous data also suggested these kinds of emotions could be building – slowly and subtly – even if they haven't necessarily manifested themselves as full-on regret.
    


            A University of Massachusetts Amherst poll, for instance, showed the percentage of Trump voters who were “very confident” in their 2024 vote dropping from 74% in April to 69% in August.
    


            Only 1% said they regretted their vote, but about 3 in 10 had some kinds of reservations about it – ranging from “some regrets” (2%) and “mixed feelings” (6%) to remaining confident in their vote but having “some concerns” (19%).
    


            The data suggest Trump voters could actually be underselling their overall disenchantment with him, to some degree. They might not be full-on regretful or disapproving, but they seem to be coming to certain realizations about what Trump is doing – a lot like the mother in the sketch.
    


            But just like the mother in the sketch, they might be apprehensive about admitting that to those around them (or even to a pollster).
    


            After all, nobody likes to admit they were wrong – especially when the other side is so annoying about it.

            President Donald Trump on Monday announced he would reduce tariffs on Indian goods in exchange for, among other things, a promise to stop buying Russian oil.
    


            That will be a tall task: India has been importing roughly 1.5 million barrels of Russian oil each day — even months after Trump placed tariffs on Indian goods as punishment — according to Kpler, a global trade data provider. Russian oil makes up more than a third of India's overall imports.
    


            Trump said in a social media post that he spoke Monday morning with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who agreed to replace the country's Russian crude imports with oil from Venezuela and the United States. Venezuelan oil is of the same quality as Russian oil — heavy, sour and perfect for making derivatives like fuel oil and diesel, which India's refineries are already set up to process, noted Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital.
    


            It's not clear, however, how long that transition may take. Venezuela's oil infrastructure is dilapidated and requires about a decade of work and tens of billions of investment dollars to return it to the more-than-3 million barrels a day output it had achieved before the country's Socialist government took control in 1999.
    


            India also buys more oil from Russia than Venezuela produces.
    


            “Fully replacing Russian oil with oil from Venezuela or the US will take significant investment,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Asset Management. “But. over time, this may create additional challenges for the Russian economy.”
    


            India is a major purchaser of Russian oil, which has been sanctioned by most Western countries because of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war with Ukraine. China buys significantly more Russian oil than India — and unlike India, China hasn't faced additional tariffs for purchasing Russian oil. Turkey is a distant third.
    


            Indian government officials have defended purchasing Russian oil previously, calling it essential to the country's energy security. India is the world's third-largest consumer of oil, and Russia is a close-by seller. India relies on its crude to support its fast-growing economy, fueled by the world's largest population.
    


            And Russian oil has traded at a significant discount – roughly $16 a barrel – to OPEC or US crude, making it hard for India to quit, noted Robert Yawger at Mizuho Securities. Even after this agreement with the United States, Yawger said he expected India may flout sanctions and purchase Russian oil, as it has throughout the past several years.
    


            “There's been a zillion different ways they have been able to outflank sanction authorities,” Yawger said. “They'll find a way to go dark fleet and get those barrels moved.” (Dark fleets are ships that use murky tactics to transport oil for pariah states.)
    


            But as oil prices have come down over the past several months, the difference in price between sanctioned oil and non-sanctioned oil eroded, allowing India to make a change.
    


            “When oil prices were high, that was big. But with oil prices coming down, that advantage is not so substantial,” noted Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former chief economic adviser for India's government. “If you throw into the calculus that Indian exporters were suffering from Trump tariffs, it became easier to stop buying Russian oil.”
    


            US crude prices were down 5% to about $61 a barrel on Monday, but that was mostly unchanged from before Trump's announcement. Oil fell sharply earlier in the day because traders were hopeful the United States would reach a deal with Iran without striking the crude-rich country.
    


            That could imply the oil market remains skeptical that the Indian deal means much at all.
    


            “India has been slow-walking these trade talks for months, and the terms here are so vague that they could be anything from major to nothingburger,” said Scott Lincicome, an economist at the Cato Institute.
    


            Trump said Indian goods would immediately face an 18% tariff, down from a 50% – a rate that had included an additional 25% tariff Trump put in place in August to persuade India to stop purchasing Russian oil. A White House spokesperson told CNN that Trump will fully remove the additional tariff and reduce the so-called reciprocal tariff.
    


            Indian goods had among highest tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration. Because of various exemptions, the effective tariff rate on Indian goods was roughly 35%, according to Subramanian.
    


            Trump, calling Modi “one of my greatest friends,” also said India's prime minister agreed to reduce India's tariffs on US goods to zero, and to remove unspecified non-tariff barriers. Although Trump didn't explain which barriers would be removed, those often include special taxes on US companies' services or value-added taxes on goods.
    


            India also pledged to invest in American goods “at a much higher level” in addition to a $500 billion invesment in US energy, technology, agriculture and coal among other products, Trump said.
    


            Trump may have been eager to cut a deal with India after the European Union signed a long-sought free trade agreement with India last week, noted Subramanian.
    


            “If India gives preferential access to the EU, US business is affected,” he said. “There has been a domino effect.”
    


            Although India isn't one of America's largest trading partners, the reduction in tariffs could nevertheless make a meaningful dent: The United States imported $95.5 billion in goods from India in 2025 as of November, 3% of the value of total imported goods, and it exported $42 billion of goods there over that time, according to the US Census Bureau.
    


            Among the top goods the US imported from India last year are computers and other electronics, such as phones, pharmaceuticals, apparel and chemicals. Jewelry prices in the United States have risen in recent months in part because of tariffs on India. Meanwhile, India's top imports from the US were oil, gas, airplanes and airplane parts.
    


            Beyond goods, corporate America has grown increasingly reliant on India. Companies including American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and Google have deepened their footprint in India, hiring workers there rather than sponsoring visas to work in the US and even opened new offices there.

            Donald Trump on Monday slammed the Grammy Awards and threatened to sue host Trevor Noah after the comedian joked about the president and Jeffrey Epstein's island.
    


            “The Grammy Awards are the WORST, virtually unwatchable! Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island,” Trump wrote on Truth Social early Monday. The president added he couldn't speak for Clinton, but that he has “never been to Epstein Island.”
    


            Trump, calling Noah a “total loser,” said that “it looks like I'll be sending my lawyers” to sue him for “plenty” of money.
    


            The comedian made the quip in reference to the song of the year award, saying: “That is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense … because Epstein's island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Noah for comment.
    


            The comments come after the Justice Department on Friday released more than 3 million pages of files related to Epstein, the convicted sex offender, including some that contain references to Trump, Clinton and other powerful figures.
    


Of course the Grammys were going to be political. But that's not all that happened



            Trump and Clinton have denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein, who owned a private island in the Caribbean. Trump said last year that he rejected an invitation from Epstein to visit his island, in what he called a moment of good judgment.
    


            “I never had the privilege of going to his island, and I did turn it down. A lot of people in Palm Beach were invited to his island. In one of my very good moments, I turned it down,” Trump told reporters in July.
    


            Clinton has also denied ever having visited Epstein's island.
    


            Trump frequently criticizes Hollywood awards shows for making jabs at his expense. In his post Monday, he said Noah was “almost as bad as Jimmy Kimmel at the Low Ratings Academy Awards.” Kimmel, who has frequently drawn the president's ire, called out Trump onstage in 2024 after he insulted the comedian on social media.
    


            The Grammys ceremony, which aired Sunday night on CBS, included numerous musicians criticizing the Trump administration's federal immigration crackdown. Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, who took home three awards, began one of his speeches by saying, “Before I say thanks to God, I'm gonna say: ICE out!”
    


            During another acceptance speech, delivered mostly in Spanish, Bad Bunny dedicated his album of the year win to “all the people who had to leave their homeland, their country to follow their dreams.”
    


            Some celebrities wore pins that read “ICE out,” which has been used at protests as a call to end operations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

A total of 23 converted warehouses could imprison up to 80,000 people, estimates suggest.

The Trump administration is purchasing warehouses across the U.S. with the intention of converting them into immigration jails as the White House expands its brutal immigration crackdown.

At least seven sites being looked at by the administration could be used to imprison 7,500 people or more, with some sites coming close to a 10,000-person figure.

All told, the 23 warehouse sites being considered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would imprison as many as 80,000 people if converted into immigration jails — and more if the administration fails to implement safe living standards. 

Eighteen states in total — including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Virginia — could be part of the project. The administration is likely paying hundreds of millions of dollars collectively for these buildings, and the price tag will likely reach into the billions with the added cost of converting them into prisons.

If the administration follows through with this plan, it will be the largest expansion of immigrant prisons in U.S. history. 

A post from DHS on X claims that the buildings they're purchasing “will not be warehouses — they will be well structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards.”

But experts believe it will be difficult to ensure the warehouses meet safety standards before agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and/or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) begin imprisoning people within their walls. Indeed, at least one of the warehouses being considered for purchase is reputed to be dangerous on hot weather days. 

Meanwhile, “regular detention standards” in facilities already operated by DHS are abusive and inhumane, human rights groups have pointed out. The Trump administration reopened a former state prison in Texas last year, for example, in order to imprison immigrant families, including young children. Conditions in that prison have been described as “horrible,” with water and food containing contaminants that could make people sick. 

The purchase and conversion of these buildings would be a major escalation of President Donald Trump's already deeply unpopular immigration crackdown, in which federal agents have terrorized communities across the U.S., often abducting people with pending asylum cases or who were set to receive green cards with no regard for their due process rights, and even detaining U.S. citizens. 

Some cities have sought to prevent the Trump administration from purchasing warehouses within their boundaries that could be used to imprison immigrants. In Kansas City, the city council voted last month in favor of a five-year moratorium that bans any detention facility from being established if it is not owned by the city itself. 

That ban could be challenged — the state legislature, for example, which is controlled by Republicans, could pass a bill nullifying local ordinances seeking to block the administration from buying these warehouses. The White House could also file a lawsuit claiming federal “supremacy clause” arguments.

But city leaders say they will not give up without a fight.

“I will use every tool at my disposal to fight this federally funded terrorist organization that is ICE,” Kansas City Councilman Jonathan Duncan said after the ordinance was passed. “While today's moratorium vote was a good first step to stopping this mass incarceration concentration camp from being built in our City, this fight is far from over. We will need to put public pressure on any business that thinks they can sell out our community for personal profit. That comes next.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            Lawyers representing victims of Jeffrey Epstein are asking judges to force the Justice Department to take down the millions of Epstein-related documents it has posted online, saying in a letter dated Sunday that the failure to properly redact victims' information has triggered an “unfolding emergency.”
    


            The letter, written by prominent Epstein victims' lawyers Brittany Henderson and Brad Edwards and addressed to two federal judges in New York who are overseeing Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's cases, requests an “immediate judicial intervention” to address the fact that victims' information was included in the millions of Epstein-related records that were released.
    


            Henderson told CNN that the letter was sent to the judges. The letter is not yet available on the public court docket.
    


            “Within the past 48 hours, the undersigned alone has reported thousands of redaction failures on behalf of nearly 100 individual survivors whose lives have been turned upside down by DOJ's latest release,” Henderson and Edwards wrote to judges Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer.
    


            “There is no conceivable degree of institutional incompetence sufficient to explain the scale, consistency, and persistence of the failures that occurred —particularly where the sole task ordered by the Court and repeatedly emphasized by DOJ was simple: redact known victim names before publication,” they also wrote.
    


New document dump does little to answer Epstein questions or the pain of survivors



            The lawyers list numerous examples of redaction errors that they've come across, such as one minor victim's name allegedly being “revealed 20 times in a single document.” Once those mistakes were reported to the Justice Department, the department only fixed three of the errors, “leaving 17 instances still unpredicted as of this filing,” the lawyers wrote.
    


            Other examples included one email that allegedly lists 32 underage victims “with only one name redacted and 31 left visible,” as well as FBI “302” forms with full first and last names of victims unredacted.
    


            The Justice Department said in a response filed to judges in both cases Monday that it has removed all documents that victims or their lawyers identified.
    


            “As of the writing of this letter, all documents requested by victims or counsel to be removed by yesterday evening have been removed for further redaction, and the Department is continuing to process any new requests and to run its own searches to identify any other documents that may require further redaction,” DOJ said.
    


            CNN reported on Friday that multiple survivors, including anonymous “Jane Doe” victims, were seeing their names and information throughout the files that were published.
    


            Sunday's letter also includes testimony from various anonymous “Jane Doe” victims who described receiving death threats and harassment from the media since the publication of the files.
    


            One Jane Doe is quoted as saying: “The release of this information is not only profoundly distressing and retraumatizing, but it also places me and my child at potential physical risk.”
    


            “DOJ cannot plausibly characterize this as error, negligence, or bureaucratic failure. The task was straightforward: take the list of known victims and redact those names everywhere they appear,” the lawyers wrote. “When DOJ believed it was ready to publish, it needed only to type each victim's name into its own search function. Any resulting hit should have been redacted before publication. Had DOJ done that, the harm would have been avoided”
    


            In a separate statement to CNN, Henderson said: “With every second that passes, additional harm is being caused to these women. They are scared, they are devastated, and they are begging for our government to protect them from further harm.”
    


            A Department of Justice spokesperson previously told CNN that it takes victim protection “very seriously” and has redacted thousands of victims'  names in the published records, with 500 reviewers looking at the files “for this very reason.”
    


“When a victim's name is alleged to be unredacted, our team is working around the clock to fix the issue and republish appropriately redacted pages as soon as possible,” the Justice Department said. “To date, 0.1% of released pages have been found to have victim identifying information unredacted.”

Trump supporter Júnior Pena falsely claimed migrants being rounded up, including Brazilians, were ‘all crooks'

A rightwing Brazilian influencer who claimed Donald Trump's immigration crackdown targeted only “crooks” has been arrested by ICE agents in New Jersey.

Júnior Pena, whose full name is Eustáquio da Silva Pena Júnior, declared his support for the US president in a recent video message to his hundreds of thousands of social media followers.

“I [support] Donald Trump – I like the guy,” announced the South American TikToker and Instagrammer whose account purports to show “the reality of the United States” from a migrant's perspective.

In a previous video, Pena reportedly urged Brazilians to stay calm and not “despair” after reports that ICE agents were rounding up migrants, including Brazilians. “But they're all crooks. The lot of them,” he falsely claimed of the migrants being seized.

On Saturday, Pena was himself reportedly detained and sent to the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. One friend told the local newspaper the Brazilian Times that Pena had been taken into custody after missing a court hearing. The detainee's lawyer, Andrew Lattarulo, was reportedly trying to resolve the situation and prevent him being transferred to another state.

The Brazilian influencer has reportedly lived in the US since 2009 and hails from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais, from where a large number of people have emigrated to the US and Europe.

Pena uses his social networks to echo the stories of migrants as well as voices critical of Brazil's leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and those supportive of its recently jailed former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who is an ally of Trump.

The US's estimated 2 million-strong Brazilian community has been badly affected by Trump's anti-migrant offensive, with the number of deported Brazilians hitting a record high of 2,785 last year, compared with 1,640 in 2024.

In a recent report about the “veritable manhunt” playing out under Trump, the Brazilian magazine Veja warned readers: “There is an atmosphere of fear on the streets where anyone who ‘looks foreign' can be a target … irrespective of their [immigration] status.”

The magazine said Brazilian migrants in cities such as Boston were adopting drastic “survival tactics” including not speaking Portuguese in public and trying to dress like “average Americans” when leaving their homes.

Leftwing Brazilians flocked to Pena's Instagram account to taunt him after news of his detention went viral. “You supported Trump and in the end you suffered the consequences,” wrote one. “What goes around comes around,” a second critic posted.

Friends of the influencer posted messages asking his followers to pray.

This is Asami Terajima reporting from a very cold Kyiv on day 1,440 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story:

Russian troops are trying to "bypass and infiltrate" the destroyed town of Vovchansk in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, and the situation is "frankly difficult," Viktor Tregubov, a spokesman for Ukraine's Joint Forces in charge of the area, said on Feb. 2. 

Speaking on national TV, Tregubov said Russian troops are pressing on Ukrainian positions on the outskirts of Vovchansk. 

"The city is completely destroyed, there is no infrastructure to serve as a barrier," Tregubov said, as cited by Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform. 

"And the Russians have been pressing there for a very long time, and the distance to the border is minimal."

Vovchansk — just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Russian border — endured Russian occupation until the 2022 autumn Ukrainian counter-offensive liberated the town, only to face heavy fighting again after Russia began a new push in May 2024, forcing many residents to flee their homes.

Updated 5:40 p.m. Kyiv time

Russia struck a coal mine operated by Ukraine's biggest private energy firm, DTEK, in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast for the second time over the past day, the company said on Feb. 2.

The Feb. 2 attack damaged administrative buildings at the facility. No casualties were reported in the strike, according to the statement.

The news follows a deadly Russian drone attack on a bus carrying miners, which killed at least 12 people and injured 16 others on Feb. 1. in the town of Ternivka.

The attack represents the largest single loss for DTEK since the start of the full-scale war, CEO Maksym Timchenko said.

Feb. 2 was declared a day of mourning in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in memory of the miners killed in the recent strike.

Updated 4:52 p.m. Kyiv time

The Ukrainian government approved a resolution on Feb. 2 mandating the registration of Starlink terminals to prevent their use by Russian forces, Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced.

The move follows reports of Russia using Starlink-equipped drones, which are particularly difficult to intercept due to their low-altitude flight and resistance to electronic warfare.

Under the resolution, Ukraine will introduce a so-called "whitelist" for Starlink terminals, with all unverified devices to be disconnected. The system will be implemented in cooperation with SpaceX, the manufacturer of Starlink terminals.

Fedorov said these measures are currently the only technical solution to counter the use of the technology by Russian forces.

Fedorov's statement came days after Ukraine's Defense Ministry reached out to SpaceX, urging the company to prevent Russian drones from using Starlink, as the satellite internet system could help them to operate further over Ukraine.

The company responded swiftly, with U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk writing on Feb. 1 that SpaceX's efforts to halt "unauthorized" Russian use of Starlink seemed to have worked.

SpaceX's initial steps to stop Russia from using Starlink to control attack drones over Ukraine are already delivering "real results," Fedorov said on Feb. 1.

Updated 4:50 p.m. Kyiv time 

Ukraine's General Staff reported on Feb. 2 "a series of effective strikes" on Russian command posts in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. 

Overnight Ukrainian drone strikes hit two Russian command posts, one regimental and another divisional level, in the Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast, as well as an ammunition depot, according to the General Staff. 

In another hot spot of the war, down in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian drone strikes hit Russia's drone command posts, the General Staff also claimed. 

"The Defense Forces are systematically undermining the offensive potential of the Russian occupiers in order to stop Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine," the General Staff wrote in its Telegram post. 

Updated 3:30 p.m. Kyiv time

More than 200 buildings in Kyiv remain without heating as temperatures plunge, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 2. 

Zelensky said that the lack of heating in over 200 buildings is mostly due to the Jan. 31 outage, which authorities said was caused by technical malfunctions amid freezing temperatures. 

Russia has scaled up its energy blitz in January, targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure with barrages of missiles and drones in an attempt to lower Ukrainians' morale as they try to survive in cold temperatures, often without electricity, heating, or water. 

Updated 3:20 p.m. Kyiv time

A shortage of air defense missiles has left some Ukrainian air defense systems empty at times amid the threat of further Russian attacks, Yurii Ihnat, head of the Air Force's communications department, said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on Feb. 2.

With the onset of winter, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in an effort to plunge the country into a nationwide blackout. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air defense forces lack sufficient resources to intercept all Russian missiles and drones.

Ihnat said that Ukrainian authorities, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have repeatedly stressed the shortage of missiles for air defense systems, noting that some of them are depleted and not ready to repel Russian attacks.

"Indeed, before one such attack, we were provided with the necessary means a day in advance," Ihnat said. "Ukrainian forces repelled that massive strike quite successfully, thanks to missiles for F-16s, NASAMS, IRIS-T, and Patriot."

"There were moments when there was a serious shortage of these missiles. I won't reveal any secrets. For example, there is a NASAMS system, but instead of six missiles in the launcher, there are only two."

At least 14 people have been killed and 38 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Feb. 2.

The Air Force said that Russian forces had attacked Ukraine with a ballistic missile and 171 drones, of which around 100 were Shahed-type drones. It reported downing 157 drones in the east, south, and north of the country.

In central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a Russian drone hit a bus carrying miners after their shifts near the town of Pavlohrad, killing at least 12 and injuring 16 others on Feb. 1, regional governor Oleksandr Hanzha and DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy firm, reported.

Russian attacks in the southwestern part of the region, in Nikopol and other towns nearby, wounded a 72-year-old man, Hanzha said on Feb. 1.

DTEK reported on Feb. 2 that Russia carried out another attack on its coal mining company's facility in the region, damaging its administrative buildings. No casualties were reported. 

In eastern Donetsk Oblast, regional governor Vadym Filashkin reported that two people were killed and four others were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day.

In northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported that a 20-year-old and a 52-year-old woman were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day.

In the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia and its surrounding region, 12 people were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, regional governor Ivan Fedorov reported.

A Russian drone attack targeted yet another Ukrainian Railways infrastructure, targeting a diesel locomotive, used to generate electricity from diesel fuel, in Zaporizhzhia, the Ministry for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine reported on Feb. 2.

In southern Kherson Oblast, three people were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.

Russia has lost around 1,241,530 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Jan. 29.

The number includes 850 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,627 tanks, 23,981 armored fighting vehicles, 76,585 vehicles and fuel tanks, 36,802 artillery systems, 1,633 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,291 air defense systems, 435 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 121,217 drones, 28 ships and boats, and two submarines.

Russian troops are trying to "bypass and infiltrate" the destroyed town of Vovchansk in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, and the situation is "frankly difficult," Viktor Tregubov, a spokesman for Ukraine's Joint Forces in charge of the area, said on Feb. 2. 

Speaking on national TV, Tregubov said Russian troops are pressing on Ukrainian positions on the outskirts of Vovchansk. 

"The city is completely destroyed, there is no infrastructure to serve as a barrier," Tregubov said, as cited by Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform. 

"And the Russians have been pressing there for a very long time, and the distance to the border is minimal."

Vovchansk — just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Russian border — endured Russian occupation until the 2022 autumn Ukrainian counter-offensive liberated the town, only to face heavy fighting again after Russia began a new push in May 2024, forcing many residents to flee their homes.

About 80 buildings remain without heating following a Jan. 31 mass outage in Ukraine's energy grid, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported in the evening on Feb. 2. 

Klitschko said over 3,400 buildings were initially left without heating after the mass outage, which authorities said was caused by technical malfunctions that led to the shutdown of two high-voltage power lines amid freezing temperatures. Authorities have remained vague about the exact reason for the accident.  

Russia has intensified its energy blitz in January, targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure with barrages of missiles and drones, in an attempt to lower Ukrainians' morale amid freezing temperatures. Earlier in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that more than 200 buildings in Kyiv remained without heating. 

"Utility and energy workers are working around the clock to connect buildings to the heat supply," Klitschko said in his Telegram post.

One person was killed, and two others were wounded by Russian attacks on central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, regional governor Oleksandr Hanzha reported on Feb. 2. 

Russia attacked an area east of Dnipro city with guided aerial bombs (KAB) and drones, killing a 67-year-old man, according to Hanzha. 

Two others were wounded in another Russian attack on Nikopol and its neighboring towns, located across the Dnipro River from the Moscow-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. A 52-year-old man and a 46-year-old woman were injured in the attack that involved first-person view (FPV) drones and artillery, Hanzha said.

Russia struck a coal mine operated by Ukraine's biggest private energy firm, DTEK, in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the company said on Feb. 2.

The Feb. 2 attack damaged administrative buildings at the facility. No casualties were reported in the strike, according to the statement.

The news follows a deadly Russian drone attack on a bus carrying miners, which killed at least 12 people and injured 16 others on Feb. 1. in the town of Ternivka.

The attack represents the largest single loss for DTEK since the start of the full-scale war, CEO Maksym Timchenko said.

Feb. 2 was declared a day of mourning in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in memory of the miners killed in the strike.

The Ukrainian government approved a resolution on Feb. 2 mandating the registration of Starlink terminals to prevent their use by Russian forces, Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced.

The move follows reports of Russia using Starlink-equipped drones, which are particularly difficult to intercept due to their low-altitude flight and resistance to electronic warfare.

Under the resolution, Ukraine will introduce a so-called "whitelist" for Starlink terminals, with all unverified devices to be disconnected. The system will be implemented in cooperation with SpaceX, the manufacturer of Starlink terminals.

Fedorov said these measures are currently the only technical solution to counter the use of the technology by Russian forces.

Fedorov's statement came days after Ukraine's Defense Ministry reached out to SpaceX, urging the company to prevent Russian drones from using Starlink, as the satellite internet system could help them to operate further over Ukraine.

The company responded swiftly, with U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk writing on Feb. 1 that SpaceX's efforts to halt "unauthorized" Russian use of Starlink seemed to have worked.

SpaceX's initial steps to stop Russia from using Starlink to control attack drones over Ukraine are already delivering "real results," Fedorov said on Feb. 1.

Updated 4:50 p.m. Kyiv time 

Ukraine's General Staff reported on Feb. 2 "a series of effective strikes" on Russian command posts in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. 

Overnight Ukrainian drone strikes hit two Russian command posts, one regimental and another divisional level, in the Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast, as well as an ammunition depot, according to the General Staff. 

In another hot spot of the war, down in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian drone strikes hit Russia's drone command posts, the General Staff also claimed. 

"The Defense Forces are systematically undermining the offensive potential of the Russian occupiers in order to stop Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine," the General Staff wrote in its Telegram post. 

Updated 3:30 p.m. Kyiv time

More than 200 buildings in Kyiv remain without heating as temperatures plunge, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 2. 

Zelensky said that the lack of heating in over 200 buildings is mostly due to the Jan. 31 outage, which authorities said was caused by technical malfunctions amid freezing temperatures. 

Russia has scaled up its energy blitz in January, targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure with barrages of missiles and drones in an attempt to lower Ukrainians' morale as they try to survive in cold temperatures, often without electricity, heating, or water. 

Updated 3:20 p.m. Kyiv time

A shortage of air defense missiles has left some Ukrainian air defense systems empty at times amid the threat of further Russian attacks, Yurii Ihnat, head of the Air Force's communications department, said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on Feb. 2.

With the onset of winter, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in an effort to plunge the country into a nationwide blackout. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air defense forces lack sufficient resources to intercept all Russian missiles and drones.

Ihnat said that Ukrainian authorities, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have repeatedly stressed the shortage of missiles for air defense systems, noting that some of them are depleted and not ready to repel Russian attacks.

"Indeed, before one such attack, we were provided with the necessary means a day in advance," Ihnat said. "Ukrainian forces repelled that massive strike quite successfully, thanks to missiles for F-16s, NASAMS, IRIS-T, and Patriot."

"There were moments when there was a serious shortage of these missiles. I won't reveal any secrets. For example, there is a NASAMS system, but instead of six missiles in the launcher, there are only two."

At least 14 people have been killed and 38 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Feb. 2.

The Air Force said that Russian forces had attacked Ukraine with a ballistic missile and 171 drones, of which around 100 were Shahed-type drones. It reported downing 157 drones in the east, south, and north of the country.

In central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a Russian drone hit a bus carrying miners after their shifts near the town of Pavlohrad, killing at least 12 and injuring 16 others on Feb. 1, regional governor Oleksandr Hanzha and DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy firm, reported.

Russian attacks in the southwestern part of the region, in Nikopol and other towns nearby, wounded a 72-year-old man, Hanzha said on Feb. 1.

DTEK reported on Feb. 2 that Russia carried out another attack on its coal mining company's facility in the region, damaging its administrative buildings. No casualties were reported. 

In eastern Donetsk Oblast, regional governor Vadym Filashkin reported that two people were killed and four others were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day.

In northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported that a 20-year-old and a 52-year-old woman were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day.

In the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia and its surrounding region, 12 people were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, regional governor Ivan Fedorov reported.

A Russian drone attack targeted yet another Ukrainian Railways infrastructure, targeting a diesel locomotive, used to generate electricity from diesel fuel, in Zaporizhzhia, the Ministry for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine reported on Feb. 2.

In southern Kherson Oblast, three people were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.

Russia has lost around 1,241,530 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Jan. 29.

The number includes 850 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,627 tanks, 23,981 armored fighting vehicles, 76,585 vehicles and fuel tanks, 36,802 artillery systems, 1,633 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,291 air defense systems, 435 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 121,217 drones, 28 ships and boats, and two submarines.

Providers are arranging home visits and telehealth as neighbors pick up prescriptions, groceries and diapers

A public health crisis is unfolding in Minnesota as people targeted by federal agents are afraid to seek healthcare while some healthcare staff are also fearful for their safety at work.

Community organizations and health providers are now arranging home visits, telehealth appointments and other alternate care.

“We're seeing residents not wanting to leave their homes, not go to work, not go to their doctor appointments, not going to their regularly scheduled checkups, postponing surgeries, postponing care,” said Angela Conley, Hennepin county commissioner for district 4, where Renee Good was killed.

People who have been targeted by federal agents because of the color of their skin, their accent or their immigration status are now avoiding leaving their homes to seek routine or even emergency healthcare. They fear unfamiliar cars idling outside clinics and in hospital parking garages. Pregnant patients are laboring at home; diabetic patients are diluting or forgoing their insulin; injured and sick people are avoiding the hospital and postponing surgeries.

“They are afraid of being pulled out of their car and taken to the Whipple building and sent on a flight to Texas, even our legal permanent residents, United States citizens. Everybody is afraid,” Conley added.

Munira Maalimisaq, founder and CEO of the Inspire Change Clinic in Minneapolis, noted that “even people who are documented are not going to their doctor's appointments. People who have their citizenship are not coming in.”

“It is a health issue. When people are too afraid to seek care, diseases worsen and emergencies increase and people die unnecessarily,” Maalimisaq said.

Providers said that there are immediate and long-term health dangers from the federal occupation of Minnesota, including clashes with agents, stress, food insecurity, exacerbation of chronic illness and acute emergencies.

“If people aren't getting their medications and they're not getting their treatments, they will die,” said Mary Turner, president of National Nurses United (NNU) and an ICU nurse in the Minneapolis area. “I dread the day that the stories start to come out about finding people dead in their homes because they're afraid to seek medical care … We're going to start to find dead bodies.”

Many organizations, including NNU, are calling for the abolition of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“All they've become now is a violent, racist, lawless agency, and you can see that in our streets. And we're saying as a nursing organization: not one more penny goes to ICE,” Turner said.

Community organizations, local programs and volunteers have quickly pivoted to arranging home visits for medical care and offering telehealth where it's appropriate. Neighbors are arranging rides to clinic visits and hospitals and picking up prescriptions, groceries, formula and diapers.

“We are all working very diligently to make sure hospitals are as safe as they possibly can be, and that we can amplify existing systems for alternative care like telehealth and home health and prescription delivery,” said Erin Stevens, a physician in Minneapolis and member with the Committee to Protect Health Care.

As patients began canceling appointments or failing to show up at all, Maalimisaq decided to create a rapid response unit at her clinic in December. Soon, she received a call from a stranger, someone who had heard of her work in the community and wanted to know whether she could check on a church member who was nine months pregnant. Maalimisaq and an OB-GYN visited the woman's home and discovered she was 8cm dilated, nearly ready to deliver the baby. But the woman refused to go by ambulance to the hospital.

“She was so fearful that they were going to take her away while she was in labor,” Maalimisaq said. She called ahead to the hospital and arranged to meet in a safe place, and Maalimisaq and the physician drove the laboring woman to the hospital, where she safely delivered her baby.

Doctors began calling Maalimisaq to see whether the rapid response unit could deliver seizure medications and check on pregnant patients. The requests flooded in, but they didn't have enough staff at the clinic, so they put out a call to local providers. More than 150 providers answered: emergency physicians, cardiologists, pediatricians, “everything that you could think of”, Maalimisaq said. They take care of wounds and sprains, administer medications, drop off food and sometimes serve as a shoulder to cry on.

Officials are urging people to continue receiving healthcare. “Go to the hospital if you're sick, please go to the clinic, go to your appointment,” Conley emphasized, but added that, for those who cannot leave, “we will come to you”.

Immediately after Good's killing, Hennepin county and the city of Minneapolis created a program called Operation Reconnect, a kind of incident command center available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for public health during this crisis. They have also partnered with neighborhood organizations on food drives, clothing swaps and transportation for medical visits.

“It's a public health crisis because people don't have access to what they typically would, whether it is baby formula, whether it is getting for their mental health visits or picking up prescriptions that they need,” Conley said.

Most areas of clinics and hospitals are considered private property, which federal agents need signed judicial warrants to enter. Hospital staff have also been trained on what to do if agents appear.

“They're going to places where people are vulnerable,” Conley said of federal agents. But she hasn't heard of any instances of agents camping out in the lobby or other public areas of hospitals: “I want to be very clear: our hospital is a safe space where people who are in need of emergency care can go get care.”

These health issues accumulate atop the immediate dangers of the clashes: car crashes, teargas and pepper spray, rubber bullets and actual bullets. Detainees report poor conditions and a lack of adequate medical care. Liam Conejo Ramos, the five-year-old asylum seeker detained in Minneapolis who became ill with fever, vomiting and lethargy, was held until Saturday at Dilley Immigration Processing Center in Texas, where a measles outbreak was detected on Friday. There were 32 deaths in ICE custody last year.

Health providers, including doctors, nurses, aides and workers in housekeeping and food service, are also fearful of being detained. The Department of Homeland Security is auditing at least one hospital's employment records.

At Turner's hospital, workers under threat are leaving their contact information and other details – whether they have family members and pets at home – in sealed envelopes with their union representatives.

“If they all of a sudden don't show up, their information is sealed somewhere safely,” Turner said.

Maalimisaq, who is Somali, says she and her staff “show up” and do the work, but she battles the daily fear that they will be targeted next.

“I've never felt this vulnerable,” Maalimisaq said, but added: “There is no way I would ever sit back and not do something because it puts me in harm's way. Their lives would be in danger if we didn't provide the care that they needed.”

Many of her patients are not able to speak up for themselves right now, which is why “we as healthcare providers are using our voice, Maalimisaq said. “Healthcare needs to remain safe and accessible for everyone. We will do anything it takes to do that.”

Colombia's drug traffickers are establishing new routes through Ecuador and Peru to reach legal seaports, swapping speedboats for container ships as they adapt to U.S. military threats.Karen Toro/Reuters

The United States' aggressive boat bombing campaign targeting suspected drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere has begun to reshape Colombia's drug trade and its long-running armed conflict as criminal organizations find new ways to move cocaine, experts and Indigenous leaders say. 

But the lethal strikes by U.S. forces on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, which have killed at least 126 people since Sept. 2, have done little to make a dent in Colombia's lucrative cocaine trade. 

Bilateral drug control efforts are expected to be top of the agenda on Tuesday when Colombian President Gustavo Petro travels to Washington to meet U.S. President Donald Trump. Mr. Trump has described his Colombian counterpart as “an illegal drug dealer” and, after removing Nicolás Maduro from power in Venezuela, he had suggested Mr. Petro could be next. But a conciliatory phone call in January led to a detente. 

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's most recently published report, potential cocaine production in Colombia in 2023 was 2,664 metric tons. The Colombian government said it seized 794.5 tons of cocaine in 2024 (up to November), worth an estimated US$2.52-billion on the streets of North America and Europe, the world's largest markets.

In Colombia, “people are scared to involve themselves in trafficking and to leave on the speedboats heading toward international markets,” said Javier Florez, director of conflict and security at the Ideas for Peace Foundation, a think tank. 

However, rather than halting the cocaine trade, Operation Southern Spear, as the U.S. military effort is known, appears to have simply displaced it. 

In Colombia's Pacific region, from which most U.S.-bound cocaine departs, the country's traffickers are establishing new routes through Ecuador and Peru to reach legal seaports, swapping speedboats for container ships as they adapt to U.S. military threats, said Mr. Florez.

The Caribbean operation has also led to the carving of new routes through the Amazon rain forest into Brazil and Venezuela. The scramble to control these lucrative corridors has aggravated an existing conflict between two rebel groups, the National Liberation Army (ELN) and Second Marquetalia, an offshoot of the demobilized FARC guerrillas. Already battling over illegal economies like gold mining, the recent surge in drug trafficking has only intensified their fighting. 

“Clashes over control of drug trafficking corridors have devastated riverine communities in Venezuela and Colombia, confining or displacing populations and driving targeted killings,” said Bram Ebus, director at Amazon Underworld, an investigative journalism collective, in an interview from Bogota.

Deep in the Colombian Amazon, Indigenous leaders began to sound the alarm about a rise in criminal activity on their waterways in December, reporting a surge in boats zooming down the rivers night and day in the lawless jungle region. The threat of violence has forcibly confined at least 3,000 families who are unable to leave their villages to fish, farm and hunt, according to a report published by Mr. Ebus.

Not only has Washington's boat bombing campaign triggered conflict over new strategic routes, it has acted as a catalyst for violence in drug producing regions by pushing down the price of coca, the plant used to make cocaine. 

A round of violence broke out in late December in the northeast Catatumbo region between the ELN and Frente 33, a FARC-dissident group, after a year in which levels of violence had stabilized, said Luis Niño, the government's High Peace Adviser for the region. 

He said Washington's boat bombing campaign was one of the reasons for the violence and had raised the stakes of the conflict. 

“If [the rebels] want to export [cocaine], it must be via routes not controlled by the U.S. government, and that makes it much more complex,” said Mr. Niño, who is responsible for negotiating with guerrilla groups in Catatumbo.

He said the logistical challenge of moving cocaine has pushed down the price of coca leaves and paste as fewer buyers travel to the region. Because rebel groups in Catatumbo rely on coca and its derivatives for a large portion of their revenue, the fall in prices has added a new imperative in their bloody turf war. 

Since December, about 2,600 people in Catatumbo have been forced to flee their homes by the fighting, according to Mr. Niño. 

As well as raising the stakes of the armed conflict, local farmers, the majority of whom depend on coca cultivation for their livelihood, have been hit hard. 

“There are many farmers who have the product but have not been able to sell it,” said Jaime Botero, the president of the rural community action body in Tibú, the world's largest coca-growing municipality.

The economic impact on farmers who depend on the coca trade could unleash further humanitarian consequences, and potentially fuel recruitment to armed groups, Mr. Niño said, as struggling farmers grow more desperate and more vulnerable.

Iran is weighing the terms for resuming talks with the United States soon, a Foreign Ministry official said on Monday, after both sides signalled readiness to revive diplomacy over a long-running nuclear dispute and dispel fears of a new regional war.

Tensions are running high amid a military buildup by the U.S. Navy near Iran, following a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded Iran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was “seriously talking,” while Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that arrangements for negotiations were under way.

Analysis: When it comes to Iran, is Trump a man without a plan?

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three preconditions for resumption of talks: Zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile program and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long rejected all three demands as unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers see the ballistic missile program, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Tehran was considering “the various dimensions and aspects of the talks,” adding that “time is of the essence for Iran as it wants lifting of unjust sanctions sooner.”

A senior Iranian official and a Western diplomat told Reuters that U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi could meet in Turkey in the coming day.

A Turkish ruling party official told Reuters that Tehran and Washington had agreed that this week's talks would be focused on diplomacy, a potential reprieve for possible U.S. strikes.

Witkoff is expected to visit Israel to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's military chief, two senior Israeli officials said separately on Monday.

The Iranian official said “diplomacy is ongoing. For talks to resume, Iran says there should not be preconditions and that it is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU), accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution.”

However, he added, for the start of talks, Tehran wants U.S. military assets moved away from Iran.

“Now the ball is in Trump's court,” he said.

Earlier: U.S. attack on Iran would spark ‘regional war' in Middle East, says Khamenei

Tehran's regional sway has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies - from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq - as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.

In June last year the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.

Recent satellite imagery of two of the targeted sites, Isfahan and Natanz, appear to show some repair work since December, with new roofing over two previously destroyed buildings. No other rebuilding is visible, according to the imagery provided by Planet Labs and reviewed by Reuters.

Washington-based think tank ISIS said satellite images from late January show construction work on tunnel entrances at Isfahan that could “indicate a preparation for additional military strikes” as was seen ahead of last year's U.S. strikes.

It could also signal the movement of assets from other facilities, it added.

After five rounds of talks that have stalled since May, 2023, several hard-to-bridge issues remained between Tehran and Washington, including Iran's insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil and refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium.

Since the U.S. strikes on Iran's three nuclear sites in June, Tehran says its uranium enrichment work has stopped. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has called on Iran repeatedly to say what happened to the HEU stock since the June attacks.

Western countries fear Iran's uranium enrichment could yield material for a warhead. Iran says its nuclear program is only for electricity generation and other civilian uses.

The Iranian sources said Tehran could ship its highly enriched uranium abroad and pause enrichment in a deal that should also include lifting economic sanctions.

Lawsuit accuses Marco Rubio and state department of imposing ‘nationality based ban on legal immigration' based on an ‘unsupported and demonstrably false claim'

Immigrant right groups, nonprofits, legal organizations and several citizens have sued the Trump administration over the visa ban on 75 countries, issued in January.

In the lawsuit, they accuse secretary of state Marco Rubio and the state department of implementing a “categorical nationality-based ban on legal immigration” for nationals of 75 countries based on “an unsupported and demonstrably false claim that nationals of the covered countries migrate to the United States to improperly rely on cash welfare and are likely to become ‘public charges'”.

Filed in a federal court in Manhattan, the plaintiffs cite examples of people from the list of countries – the overwhelming majority of which are non-European with significant nonwhite populations – who are unable to continue pursuing legal pathways to stay in the US because of the ban. In some cases, they are living with family members who have valid status in the US.

Donald Trump has announced that after a call with India's prime minister Narendra Modi they had agreed to lower tariffs between their countries.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that India had agreed to halt purchases of Russian oil, committed to reducing tariffs on US goods to zero, and committed to purchasing over $500bn worth ofAmerican products, covering energy, technology, and agriculture. In return, Trump announced a reduction of “reciprocal” tariffs on Indian goods from 25% to 18% “effective immediately”.

Truth added that India had agreed “to buy much more [oil] from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela.”

Modi confirmed the tariff reduction in a post on X, where he also praised Trump's “efforts for peace”.

Trade talks between the US and India stalled last year owing to several factors, including New Delhi's continued reliance on Russian oil, which proved a major sticking point amid Trump's efforts to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

In a letter to Democratic House members, the ranking member of the homeland security committee, Bennie Thompson, has urged his colleagues to vote against the package of bills that would keep much of the government funded, and a stopgap measure to keep the Department of Homeland Security operating for two weeks while negotiations continue.

“Democrats must act now to demand real changes that protect our communities before Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) receive another dollar in funding,” Thompson writes in a letter, co-signed by his Democratic colleagues on the House homeland security committee.

Thompson notes that Democrats should not pass the short-term relief to allow for negotiations. Noting that they should ensure several provisions, like the use of judicial warrants to carry out arrests and ensuring immigration officers are identifiable, are already included.

Democratic congresswoman Joyce Beatty has slammed the Donald Trump's announcement that the John F Kennedy Center, DC's foremost performing arts venue, will cease events for two years while it undergoes renovations.

Beatty, a representative from Ohio, said that the president had “acted with total disregard for Congress”, since the center receives a portion of its funding through appropriations. “Congress should have been consulted on any decision to shut down its operations or undertake major renovations, especially for a two-year period,” she said in a statement.

“Countless employees, artists, and others have existing contracts and agreements with the Center. What happens to them? Has Trump or his handpicked Board given any consideration to their livelihoods or futures? This is precisely why congressional oversight is essential,” she added.

After Trump returned to office last year he jettisoned the existing board, installed himself as chairman, and ensured that his handpicked board of trustees voted to rename the venue as the “Trump-Kennedy Center”. However, any official legal change to the name would require congressional approval.

In response to the president's takeover, several artists and production companies have decided to cut ties with the Kennedy Center in protest.

A new CBS News contributor, Peter Attia, is mentioned more than 1,700 times in the latest release of Epstein files from the justice department. Just days ago, the Guardian reported that Attia – who hosts a popular podcast about longevity –had joined the ranks at CBS under embattled editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.

Throughout the email exchanges released by the DoJ, Attia corresponded with Epstein on dozens of occasions after the late sex-offender pleaded guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution, and registers as a sexual offended.

“I get JE withdrawal when I don't see him,” Attia writes in an email to Epstein's assistant on 21 January 2016.

In CBS News' press release, announcing Attia's hiring, they note that he is “the founder of Outlive", a new app that translates longevity science into personalized daily practice” as well as Early Medical, “a medical practice that applies the principles of Medicine 3.0 to patients, aiming to simultaneously lengthen their lifespan and increase their healthspan”.

In a 2023 interview with the Guardian, Attia outlined many of his theories around the science of longevity.

A rightwing Brazilian influencer who claimed Donald Trump's immigration crackdown only targeted “crooks” has been arrested by ICE agents in New Jersey.

Júnior Pena, whose full name is Eustáquio da Silva Pena Júnior, declared his support for the US president in a recent video message to his hundreds of thousands of social media followers.

“I [support] Donald Trump – I like the guy,” announced the South American TikToker and Instagrammer whose account purports to show “the reality of the United States” from a migrant's perspective.

In a previous video, Pena reportedly urged Brazilians to stay calm and not “despair” after reports that ICE agents were rounding up migrants, including Brazilians. “But they're all crooks. The lot of them,” he falsely claimed of the migrants being seized.

On Saturday, Pena was himself reportedly detained and sent to the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. One friend told the local newspaper the Brazilian Times that Pena had been taken into custody after missing a court hearing. The detainee's lawyer, Andrew Lattarulo, was reportedly trying to resolve the situation and prevent him being transferred to another state.

The Brazilian influencer has reportedly lived in the US since 2009 and hails from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais, a state long known as a major source of migrants to the US and Europe.

House speaker Mike Johnson is set to swear in Christian Menefee, a Democrat who recently won a runoff election for a reliably blue seat in Texas.

Menefee's victory, however, means the margin in the House is even more slim: 218 Republicans to 214 Democrats. His current term will end at the end of the year, and he'll have to start campaigning almost immediately for the 2026 midterms. But this time, it will be for a new district, after the GOP-controlled legislature successfully gerrymandered the state's congressional map.

The House will try and advance a five-bill funding package, as well as a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today.

Late last week, the Senate voted to pass the final bundle of appropriations bills, but separated legislation that funds the DHS, amid widespread backlash over the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. While the House prepares to vote, a partial shutdown is under way.

Instead, lawmakers in the upper chamber voted to pass a stopgap measure to keep the DHS operating for two weeks while Democrats hammer out negotiations with the Trump administration over the future of federal immigration enforcement.

Republican House speaker Mike Johnson has signalled to GOP representatives that this path is White House-sanctioned, and urging them to get on board. But he can only afford to lose one member of his own party to pass the funding bills, and he'll also need to shore up support across the aisle.

Early reports show there are already cracks among Democrats, with some stating they'll support the legislation that the Senate passed, while others don't feel any negotiations with the president will be in good faith. On Sunday, Johnson even said that Democrats' current demands – to require federal immigration officers to show their faces and to obtain judicial warrants for any raids – are futile.

One quick note, Donald Trump is in Washington today. He'll take part in signing time today, but that's not open to the press. We'll let you know if that changes.

At present, we're not expecting to hear from the president today.

Beloved groundhog Punxsutawney Phil is said to be predicting six more weeks of wintry weather after he saw his shadow earlier today.

His annual prediction was translated by his handlers at Gobbler's Knob in western Pennsylvania.

The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club says that when Phil is deemed to have not seen his shadow, that means there will be an early spring. When he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter.

Phil tends to predict a longer winter far more often than an early spring.

Tens of thousands of people were on hand at Gobbler's Knob for the annual ritual that goes back more than a century, with ties to ancient farming traditions in Europe.

Punxsutawney's festivities have grown considerably since the 1993 movie Groundhog Day, starring Bill Murray.

Construction has resumed on four offshore wind mega-projects after they survived a near-fatal attack by Donald Trump's administration thanks to rulings by federal judges. These are being seen as victories for clean energy amid a wider war being waged on it by the Trump administration.

The windfarms are considered critical by grid planners as America faces an energy affordability crisis. Together, the four projects will contribute nearly five gigawatts of energy to the east coast, enough to power 3.5m homes.

In December, the Trump administration issued an order halting the construction of five offshore wind projects along the east coast, citing “reasons of national security”. On 9 January, during a White House meeting with oil and gas executives, the president said: “My goal is to not let any windmill be built. They're losers.”

But in mid-January, federal judges rejected the administration's claims and allowed construction to resume on four of the five projects. Work began immediately on Vineyard Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Empire Wind 1 and Revolution Wind. A fifth project, Sunrise Wind, is also fighting the stop work order and has a court hearing on Monday that industry experts believe will have a positive outcome.

Judges across different jurisdictions ruled against the Trump administration. “This is a broad rejection of the administration's arguments,” said John Carlson, the senior north-east regional policy manager for the climate non-profit Clean Air Task Force.

The stop-work order argued that wind turbines could interfere with military radar, but Carlson said it was a pretext to undermine wind power. “All these projects already went through very significant national security reviews,” he said.

“He's losing in court, and I think he will continue losing in court. But that's not the entire playing field,” Carlson noted.

To the wind industry, the court rulings are bittersweet. Trump may be losing the court battle against offshore projects already under construction, but he has succeeded in causing a nosedive in new projects, leaving the industry and its allies longing for the day he leaves office.

A public health crisis is unfolding in Minnesota as people targeted by federal agents are afraid to seek healthcare while some healthcare staff are also fearful for their safety at work.

Community organizations and health providers are now arranging home visits, telehealth appointments and other alternate care.

“We're seeing residents not wanting to leave their homes, not go to work, not go to their doctor appointments, not going to their regularly scheduled checkups, postponing surgeries, postponing care,” said Angela Conley, Hennepin county commissioner for district 4, where Renee Good was killed.

People who have been targeted by federal agents because of the color of their skin, their accent or their immigration status are now avoiding leaving their homes to seek routine or even emergency healthcare. They fear unfamiliar cars idling outside clinics and in hospital parking garages. Pregnant patients are laboring at home; diabetic patients are diluting or forgoing their insulin; injured and sick people are avoiding the hospital and postponing surgeries.

“They are afraid of being pulled out of their car and taken to the Whipple building and sent on a flight to Texas, even our legal permanent residents, United States citizens. Everybody is afraid,” Conley added.

Munira Maalimisaq, founder and CEO of the Inspire Change Clinic in Minneapolis, noted that “even people who are documented are not going to their doctor's appointments People who have their citizenship are not coming in.”

“It is a health issue. When people are too afraid to seek care, diseases worsen and emergencies increase and people die unnecessarily,” Maalimisaq said.

Washington is negotiating with Havana's leadership to strike a deal, Donald Trump has said, days after threatening Cuba's reeling economy with a virtual oil blockade.

“Cuba is a failing nation. It has been for a long time but now it doesn't have Venezuela to prop it up. So we're talking to the people from Cuba, the highest people in Cuba, to see what happens,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida on Sunday.

“I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba.”

Trump gave no indication what such a deal might entail.

The US president had said on Saturday: “It doesn't have to be a humanitarian crisis. I think they probably would come to us and want to make a deal … They have a situation that's very bad for Cuba. They have no money. They have no oil. They lived off Venezuelan money and oil, and none of that's coming now.”

Trump's second administration has been ratcheting up pressure on the communist-run island nation off south Florida since it ousted the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, whose country was a close ally of Havana and a crucial source for oil exports to Cuba.

The Reuters news agency is reporting that the US envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to visit Israel for meetings with the country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its military chief, Eyal Zamir, citing two senior Israeli officials.

Witkoff's visit will reportedly begin tomorrow. We don't know exactly what will be discussed but the trip comes as the Gaza ceasefire agreement edges forward despite Israel's frequent killing of Palestinian people in violation of its terms.

The next phases of Donald Trump's plan for Gaza require governance to be handed to Palestinian technocrats, Hamas to lay down its weapons and Israeli troops to withdraw from the territory while Gaza is rebuilt.

The disclosure of more than 3m files related to Jeffrey Epstein suggests that other men were involved in his sexual abuse, prompting questions about officials' contentions that there isn't evidence to investigate third parties for potential involvement in the late financier's crimes.

Some newly released documents contain allegations that Epstein provided victims to other men. Documents released in prior disclosures, as well as court documents, also point to others' possible criminal involvement with Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.

One accuser said that Maxwell told her that Epstein had to leave his house but that there was a friend staying who she could massage. During this encounter, this associate allegedly offered her money if she engaged in sex.

The woman alleged that she did so and that this friend paid her money. A “prosecution memorandum” dated 26 January 2021 and signed by assistant US attorneys from the southern district of New York described this encounter and said that when the woman's lawyers showed her a photo of disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, she identified him as this man. The names of the US attorneys are redacted.

It's not clear to what extent authorities investigated these allegations. Weinstein was never charged for any conduct related to Epstein.

One document, and FBI presentation that appears to have been created sometime after late July 2025, described an allegation that Epstein “told [an accuser] to give [Harvey] Weinstein a massage, during which Weinstein tells her to take off her shirt, she refuses and then Weinstein threatens to get women to come force her too.”

Weinstein, who is in jail after being convicted of sexual assault and was one of the most prominent targets of the MeToo movement, rejects misconduct claims.

President Donald Trump is once again in the mood for litigation. This morning he has threatened to sue Grammys host Trevor Noah after a joke he made about Jeffrey Epstein on stage.

Joking that this will be his last year as host, Noah quipped:

Song of the Year - that is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense because Epstein's island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton.

In repsonse, the US president said the comedian, who hosted The Daily Show on Comedy Central in the US for seven years, was a “total loser”, adding:

It looks like I'll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C., and suing him for plenty.

Trump criticised South African-born Noah‘s joke, made after the song of the year gong was handed out.

Writing on Truth Social, in his usual frenetic, rambling style, Trump said:

Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!!

I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory statement, have never been accused of being there, not even by the Fake News Media.

Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast.

He added:

Get ready Noah, I'm going to have some fun with you!

In recent years, Trump has resorted to legal action against a slew of media outlets including the BBC, the New York Times, the Associated Press and the Wall Street Journal.

Last July, US media giant Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay Trump $16m to settle a lawsuit over a CBS interview with Kamala Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee.

In other developments:

Trump announced a two-year closure of the Kennedy Center, citing construction needs to make the “finest performing arts facility of its kind, anywhere in the world”. Writing on Truth Social on Sunday evening, Trump added that the center's closure will pave way for a “new and spectacular entertainment complex”.

The deputy US attorney general, Todd Blanche, the point person on the Trump administration's Epstein files release, told ABC News on Sunday that prosecutors' review of the Jeffrey Epstein-Ghislaine Maxwell sex-trafficking case “is over”. While Blanche acknowledged “there's a lot of horrible photographs that appear to be taken by Mr Epstein or by people around him … that doesn't allow us necessarily to prosecute somebody”.

Government documents have identified the two federal officers who fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis as Jesus Ochoa, a border patrol agent, and Raymundo Gutierrez, an officer with Customs and Border Protection (CBP), according to ProPublica. According to those records, Ochoa, 43, and Gutierrez, 35, were the agents who fired their weapons during the confrontation last weekend that resulted in Pretti's death.

A five-year-old boy and his father were back in Minneapolis on Sunday after being released from a Texas immigration detention center where they were held for more than a week, according to US House representative Joaquin Castro.

Trump said his administration was in talks with Cuban leadership over a potential deal, following his earlier threats to stop the country from importing oil.

The ongoing partial US government shutdown is expected to continue into early next week, with no reopening likely before Tuesday, if what federal officials on both sides of the country's political aisle are saying is any indication.

All vaccine recommendations are being reconsidered by the US's vaccines committee, according to its top adviser, who in recent interviews slammed the requirements for attending school and said vaccines should be taken on the advice of an individual's doctor.

Medetomidine, a powerful animal sedative used by veterinarians, is fast becoming the adulterant of choice for drug cartels pushing fentanyl on American streets.

​Also known as “rhino tranq,” medetomidine is showing up more frequently than its cousin xylazine, a pain reliever, in the illicit drug supply in places such as New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, according to public health alerts.

MOSCOW, February 2. /TASS/. Paris is preparing neo-colonial coups d'etat on the African continent and seeking opportunities for "political revenge" in Africa, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service's (SVR) press bureau reported.

"France is preparing neo-colonial coups in Africa," the statement said. According to information received by the SVR, "Emmanuel Macron's administration is feverishly seeking opportunities for 'political revenge' in Africa."

According to the press bureau, Paris has recently suffered significant "losses" on the continent due to patriotic forces prioritizing the interests of the people and "refusing to serve as puppets of the financial and political oligarchy of French globalists" coming to power in a number of former French colonies in Africa. "Whether inspired by the American operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro or imagining himself as the arbiter of the fate of African peoples, Macron has authorized his special services to launch a plan to eliminate 'undesirable leaders' in Africa," the press bureau pointed out.

The SVR also noted that France's involvement in the January 3 attempted coup in Burkina Faso, which was successfully thwarted, has already been established. "The rebels were tasked with killing President Ibrahim Traore, one of the leaders of the fight against neocolonialism. According to Paris' calculations, this would not only bring pro-French forces to power in Ouagadougou but also deal a blow to all supporters of sovereignty and Pan-African ideology on the continent," the statement said.

The SVR also pointed out that despite the failure of their criminal plan, "the hard-line racists in Paris are not giving up": their focus is on destabilizing the situation in "undesirable countries" in the Sahara-Sahel region with the help of local terrorist groups and the Ukrainian regime, which supplies the militants with drones and instructors. "The main target of this gang is Mali. Attacks on fuel trucks, attempts to blockade Malian cities, and terrorizing civilians all serve one purpose: creating conditions for the overthrow of President Assimi Goita. Paris continues to look for opportunities to sow chaos in the Central African Republic," the Foreign Intelligence Service added.

According to its press bureau, "another target of the French leadership's destructive attention" was Madagascar, where forces committed to developing relations with BRICS came to power in October 2025. "Paris is working on ways to overthrow the country's new president Michael Randrianirina, and to 'restore a loyal regime'," the SVR noted.

"In essence, France has moved to directly support various terrorists who are becoming its main allies on the African continent. This makes the political bankruptcy of [Emmanuel] Macron's policy all the more obvious, as he has failed to rid France of its reputation in Africa as a parasitic metropolis that robs its former colonies and hinders their development," the press bureau concluded.

MOSCOW, February 2. /TASS/. Afghanistan is an observer state in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and Kabul considers it appropriate to resume active participation in its work, Afghanistan's Ambassador to Russia, Gul Hassan, said in an interview with TASS.

When asked whether the Afghan side considers it possible to resume cooperation with the SCO, the ambassador answered affirmatively.

"Yes, Afghanistan is an observer state in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and, in accordance with this status, should participate in its meetings," the diplomat said in his first interview as head of the diplomatic mission in Moscow.

Thus, according to the ambassador, thanks to the efforts of Moscow and Beijing, most of the organization's member states "have come to the conclusion that it would be viable to restore Afghanistan's active participation in the SCO's work."

"We also count on Afghanistan's participation in the organization's upcoming meetings," he added.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican chair of a House Committee rejected an offer Monday from former President Bill Clinton to conduct a transcribed interview for a House investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, pushing the threat to hold both Clintons in contempt of Congress closer towards a vote.

The impasse comes as the full House is headed towards potential votes this week on criminal contempt of Congress charges against the Clintons. If passed, the charges threaten both Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with substantial fines and even incarceration if they are convicted.

Rep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, said on social media that he would insist on both Clintons sitting for sworn depositions before the committee in order to fulfill the panel's subpoenas. A letter from the committee to attorneys for the Clintons indicates that they had offered for Bill Clinton to conduct a 4-hour transcribed interview on “matters related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein” and for Hillary Clinton to submit a sworn declaration.

“The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,” Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said.

The Republican-controlled Oversight panel advanced criminal contempt of Congress charges last month. Nine of the committee's 21 Democrats joined Republicans in support of the charges against Bill Clinton as they argued for full transparency in the Epstein investigation. Three Democrats also supported advancing the charges against Hillary Clinton.




Bill Clinton's relationship with Epstein has re-emerged as a focal point for Republicans amid the push for a reckoning over Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 in a New York jail cell as he faced sex trafficking charges.

Clinton, like a bevy of other high-powered men, had a well-documented relationship with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He has not been accused of wrongdoing in his interactions with the late financier.

After the Clintons were both subpoenaed in August by the House Oversight Committee, their attorney had tried to argue against the validity of the subpoena. However, as Comer threatened to begin contempt of Congress proceedings, they started negotiating towards a compromise.

Still, the Clintons remained highly critical of Comer's decision, saying that he was bringing politics into the investigation while failing to hold the Trump administration accountable for delays in producing the Department of Justice's case files on Epstein.

Adrienne Gray and Carrie Sheffield join ‘Fox News @ Night' discuss the media meltdown over the White House renovations, the dismissing of the Venezuela drug threat and American mood over the economy.

Since his return to office, President Donald Trump has undertaken a series of changes aimed at reshaping the look and feel of the White House and other iconic Washington landmarks.

Over the weekend, the president announced in a Truth Social post that the Trump Kennedy Center will close later this year for a two-year renovation.

He said the decision followed a yearlong review involving contractors, arts experts and other advisers. He added that the temporary closure would allow the renovations to be completed faster and at a higher quality than if construction were carried out while performances continued. It was not immediately clear what renovations were planned, how much it would cost and what would happen to the scheduled performances.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES TWO-YEAR CLOSURE OF TRUMP KENNEDY CENTER FOR MAJOR RENOVATIONS

The Trump Kennedy Center renovations are the latest in a series of design projects the former real estate developer has pursued since returning to the White House. Read on to learn more about how the world's most famous real estate developer is leaving his mark on Washington.

In October, Trump unveiled a new monument dubbed the "Arc de Trump," which is planned to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary next year.

At a White House ballroom fundraising dinner, Trump shared additional details about the newest monument planned for the nation's capital. He said he was presented with three arch models in varying sizes — small, medium and large — and said his preference was for the largest one.

If Trump chooses the largest proposed design, the arch would rise 250 feet, eclipsing the height of the Lincoln Memorial and rivaling the U.S. Capitol dome.

The monument, a near twin of Paris's iconic Arc de Triomphe, is meant to welcome visitors crossing the Memorial Bridge from Arlington National Cemetery into the heart of the nation's capital.

Trump's taste for opulence is unmistakable in the Oval Office, where golden accents now decorate the nation's most iconic workspace, a reflection of his personal style. Last March, Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham during a tour of the Oval Office that the room "needed a little life" when asked about the gold details.

"Throughout the years, people have tried to come up with a gold paint that would look like gold, and they've never been able to do it," Trump told Ingraham. "You've never been able to match gold with gold paint, that's why it's gold," Trump added.

Since then, Trump has added gold accents throughout the Oval Office to include decorative details along the ceiling and around the doorway trim. Even the cherubs inside the door frames were given a gilded makeover.

White House spokesperson Davis Ingle previously told Fox News Digital that the gold Trump added to the Oval Office "is of the highest quality," declining to provide further details. 

The spokesperson also said that Trump personally covered the cost of the gold accents, though they did not specify how much gold was added or how much Trump spent.

Outside the Oval Office, the Trump administration unveiled the "Presidential Walk of Fame," a series of portraits of past presidents now displayed along the West Wing colonnade. The portrait of former President Joe Biden features his signature, created with an autopen, a machine that holds a pen and reproduces a person's handwriting through programmed movements.

Trump said he renovated the Lincoln bathroom in the White House because it did not reflect the style of President Abraham Lincoln's era. 

"I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an Art Deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era," Trump wrote in an Oct. 31 Truth Social post.

"I did it in black and white polished statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and in fact could be the marble that was originally there," he added.

No immediate details were available on the cost of the bathroom renovation.

Among the largest projects currently underway is a 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom designed to accommodate roughly 650 seated guests. 

On July 31, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the planned construction of the sprawling ballroom. "The White House is currently unable to host major functions honoring world leaders in other countries without having to install a large and unsightly tent approximately 100 yards away from the main building's entrance," Leavitt said during a press briefing, adding the new ballroom will be "a much-needed and exquisite addition."

The White House does not have a formal ballroom, and the new ballroom will take the place of the East Wing. Construction has already begun on the White House grounds, and the estimated cost is north of $200 million and will be financed by Trump and private donors.

Ahead of Independence Day, Trump also personally financed the installation of two 88-foot flagpoles with American flags in front of and behind the White House, each reportedly costing around $50,000. The new flags on the North and South Lawns were raised at a June 18 ceremony.

An Arizona college student is dead, and three others have been arrested after attending an off-campus fraternity event last weekend. 

Officers were called to the scene at around 8:45 a.m. on Saturday, Jan. 31, after receiving reports of an 18-year-old male student of Northern Arizona University (NAU) who was "found unresponsive" at a house on South Pine Grove Road in Flagstaff, the Flagstaff Police Department said in a statement. 

"Bystanders inside the home initiated CPR prior to police arrival," the FPD continued. "Upon arrival, officers found the individual not breathing and continued life-saving measures on scene until paramedics arrived."

The student, whose identity has not been released at the time of this report, was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene, according to authorities.

Investigators later learned the student "attended a gathering at the residence the previous evening, identified as a ‘rush' event for the Delta Tau Delta fraternity," where several individuals – including the deceased student – consumed alcohol, FPD said. 

The incident led to the arrest of three Delta Tau Delta fraternity members, according to police. 

Twenty-year-old students Carter Eslick, Riley Cass and Ryan Creech were each taken into custody and charged with hazing in connection with the student's death, FPD said in the statement.

Hazing is defined, in part, as the "submission of members or prospective members to potentially dangerous or hazardous circumstances or activities" that may result in personal injury, according to NAU. 

Detectives are still working to determine the student's manner and cause of death, the FPD said.

In a statement, NAU called the student's death a "devastating loss," while adding that "our hearts are with his family, friends and all members of our community who are grieving."

The university also acknowledged the arrest of three of its students and revealed the campus' Delta Tau Delta fraternity chapter has been suspended "to allow a full investigation to take place and prioritize student safety." 

"We want to be clear: The safety and well-being of our students remain our highest priorities. Violence, hazing or any other behavior that endangers others has no place at NAU," the university added.

In 2022, hazing was criminalized in Arizona under Jack's Law, with offenders risking punishment of up to 3.75 years in prison, according to Fraternal Law. 

The FPD, Delta Tau Delta's national chapter and NAU did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' for the annual Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania Democrats and Republicans are finding rare common ground — defending Punxsutawney Phil from animal rights activists.

Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and GOP lawmakers are jointly rejecting pressure from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to retire the famed groundhog after he predicted six more weeks of winter on Monday.

Shapiro amplified the moment on social media by posting an image of a yellow Gadsden flag — a symbol associated with conservative politics and the 2010s Tea Party movement — but with the typical snake replaced by a groundhog.

Meanwhile, the leader of the Pennsylvania House Republican caucus told Fox News Digital that PETA's latest idea, to replace Phil with a groundhog hologram, is off base.

"PETA lacks as much good taste as they do credibility here. Punxsutawney Phil and the celebration of Groundhog Day are core parts of what it means to be Pennsylvanian and are cherished by the nation," said House Minority Leader Jesse Topper of Bedford.

"On top of that, Phil is treated like royalty, and rightfully so," Topper said, referencing his spacious library digs that also include a large window allowing sunlight and the smiles of passersby.

"It sounds like it is time PETA be forcibly retired from bad takes and outlandish viewpoints."

In a statement, PETA said it wants to give Groundhog Day a "much-needed glow-up."

"Retire Phil to a reputable sanctuary with his family, and we'll provide a giant, state-of-the-art, 3-D projection hologram of a groundhog along with a vocal prognostication to light up the Gobbler's Knob stage," PETA said in a statement.

Pennsylvania Deputy Tourism Secretary Anne Ryan said in a statement that Punxsutawney Phil "draws national and international attention" to Pennsylvania every year.

"Six more weeks of winter means more time to enjoy everything that makes this season special — from skiing and snowboarding to cozy small towns, historic sites, and festive winter events," Ryan said, alluding to the commonwealth's latest tourism slogan, "The Great American Getaway."

Punxsutawney Phil lives with his wife Phyllis and their young kit at the Jefferson County Library in downtown Punxsutawney, halfway between Altoona and Erie.

The famed groundhog's support extends well beyond his burrow. Across Pennsylvania's historically German regions, including the Lehigh Valley and Dutch Country, Groundhog Day is marked by feasts hosted by more than a dozen "Grundsau Lodsch," or Groundhog Lodges, featuring traditional food, music and weather forecasts delivered in the Pennsylfaanisch dialect.

There is also the famous 1993 Bill Murray film named after the holiday.

Socialist New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani has outlined plans to scale back the city's Gifted and Talented program, prompting some education experts to warn that doing so could deprive high-achieving students, particularly those from low-income families, of critical academic opportunities.

Recent media reports indicate that Mamdani, who took office in January, intends to end the city's Gifted and Talented program for kindergarten students and delay entry until third grade, a move critics argue would amount to a major weakening of accelerated learning options in the nation's largest school district.

The plan is drawing sharp criticism from Defending Education, a national education watchdog group that previously fought, and won, a years-long legal battle to preserve New York's gifted programs after it was argued that the admissions system had discriminatory effects and reinforced racial inequities in education. 

"The Court of Appeals rightly concluded that the role of the judiciary is not to make education policy," Sarah Parshall Perry, vice president and legal fellow at Defending Education, told Fox News Digital, adding that the program complied with state education law and equal protection requirements.

But Perry warned that Mamdani's policy agenda could undo what the courts upheld.

"As we suspected he might, newly minted democratic socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani — himself, a product of expensive private schools — has pledged to shut down the gifted and talented program, despite the fact that it has helped countless students from humble backgrounds achieve their full academic potential," Perry told Fox News Digital. 

"Depriving kids of much-needed advanced learning opportunities is not only foolhardy, but it's also the height of hypocrisy coming from someone who was born into affluence and attended costly private schools. Apparently, Mamdani believes only the privileged should have access to various educational opportunities."

Mamdani has argued that early gifted testing contributes to inequities in the school system, though critics counter that dismantling selective programs does little to improve outcomes for struggling students while actively harming high performers.

Paul Runko, senior director of strategic initiatives for K-12 programs at Defending Education, echoed Perry's concerns, emphasizing the impact such changes could have on working-class families.

"On behalf of parents who simply want the best possible education for their children, Defending Education spent years in court fighting to preserve New York City's gifted and talented programs against efforts to use the courts to inject race into every aspect of the school system," Runko said.

"Those efforts may succeed if Mayor Zohran Mamdani moves forward with eliminating these accelerated learning opportunities," he warned. "Students, particularly those from lower-income families who benefit from NYC's gifted and talented programs, deserve opportunities for academic excellence, not a one-size-fits-all approach that could weaken learning for all students."

Mamdani's office pushed back on Defending Education's characterization, telling Fox News Digital that the administration opposes testing five-year-olds for gifted and talented programs but is not eliminating advanced learning opportunities across all grade levels. 

Mamdani's office said the focus is instead on reshaping the public school system to provide "rigorous" instruction for all students, rather than separating children at an early age.

Mamdani faced heated criticism from his opponents in the mayoral race regarding his plans to change the program, as well as from the Washington Post editorial board in October.

"Who could have guessed that Zohran Mamdani (D), the leading candidate to become the next New York mayor, would provoke a firestorm by announcing this week that he intends to phase out the city's early elementary school programs for gifted students in the name of equity? Parents of bright children want access to schooling that meets their needs?" The Post wrote. "Shocking."

Retired Gen. Jack Keane joins 'Fox & Friends' to weigh in on the upcoming trilateral peace talks between the U.S., Russia and Ukraine in Abu Dhabi to try and end the Russia-Ukraine war and the deadly protests in Iran.

A Russian cargo plane typically used to transfer military equipment landed at a military airfield in Havana Sunday night, echoing flight patterns seen ahead of the capture of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela.

The U.S.-sanctioned Ilyushin Il-76, operated by Russian state-linked airline Aviacon Zitotrans, was tracked landing at San Antonio de los Baños Airfield, a Cuban military installation roughly 30 miles south of Havana, according to public flight data.

Flight-tracking records show the aircraft stopped in St. Petersburg and Sochi in Russia; Mauritania, Africa; and the Dominican Republic. Each landing would have required approval from host governments, offering a window into which countries are continuing to permit Russian military-linked aviation activity despite Western sanctions.

The same aircraft conducted flights to Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba in late October 2025, as tensions between Washington and Caracas escalated. That movement preceded U.S. military action in Venezuela that ultimately ended Maduro's rule — a sequence U.S. officials and analysts have since pointed to as a warning indicator when evaluating similar Russian aviation activity in the region.

Now, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel finds himself under mounting pressure from President Donald Trump, who has sharply intensified U.S. policy toward Havana in recent weeks.

On Thursday, Trump declared a national emergency related to Cuba, asserting that the Cuban government poses an "unusual and extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The administration also said it would impose penalties on any country that sells or supplies oil to Cuba without U.S. authorization.

Trump confirmed Sunday that the U.S. is engaged in direct talks with Cuban officials.

TRUMP SAYS CUBA IS ‘READY TO FALL' AFTER CAPTURE OF VENEZUELA'S MADURO

"Cuba is a failing nation. It has been for a long time, but now it doesn't have Venezuela to prop it up," Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago, Florida. "So we're talking to the people from Cuba, the highest people in Cuba, to see what happens. I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba."

Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have both indicated support for political change in Havana, though the administration has not said whether it would pursue that objective through military action.

Russian military ties to Cuba have repeatedly triggered concern in Washington. While the Soviet Union's footprint on the island receded after the Cold War, Moscow has steadily rebuilt defense and intelligence cooperation with Havana over the past decade. U.S. officials have warned that renewed Russian activity in Cuba could pose security risks close to the U.S. mainland.

The Il-76 is a heavy transport aircraft capable of carrying roughly 50 tons of cargo or up to 200 personnel, a capability that has drawn scrutiny given the operator's history. Aviacon Zitotrans has been sanctioned by the United States, Canada and Ukraine for supporting Russia's defense sector.

"Aviacon Zitotrans has shipped military equipment such as rockets, warheads, and helicopter parts all over the world," the U.S. Treasury Department said in January 2023, when it added the airline to its sanctions list.

It remains unclear what cargo the aircraft carried on its most recent flight. During earlier operations in Venezuela, Russian state media and a Russian lawmaker said the same aircraft delivered Pantsir-S1 short-range and Buk-M2E medium-range air defense systems to Caracas.

NEW YORK (AP) — Wild swings that swept through financial markets overnight eased as trading headed westward to Wall Street on Monday. U.S. stocks rose following sharp drops in Asia and then gains in Europe, while gold and silver prices rallied back from severe earlier losses.

The S&P 500 added 0.6% and is on track to snap a three-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 439 points, or 0.9%, as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.8% higher.

Stocks of companies that make computer storage helped lead the market, adding to gains from last week following several profit reports that topped analysts' expectations. Airlines and cruise-ship operators were also strong, benefiting from a sharp easing of oil prices. 

The center of the action in financial markets was again precious metals, where momentum has suddenly halted after gold's price had roughly doubled in just 12 months.

Gold briefly dropped below $4,500 per ounce in the overnight hours, down more than $1,000 from its high point reached just last week. It later erased its loss since Friday, before pulling back to $4,730.50, down 0.3%.

Silver's price has been on an even wilder ride recently, and it swung from a 9% loss overnight to a gain of 1.2%.

Gold and silver prices had been surging as investors looked for safer things to own amid a wide range of worries, including a Federal Reserve that may be set to become less independent, a U.S. stock market that critics say is expensive, threats of tariffs and heavy debt loads for governments worldwide.




Their prices cratered on Friday, including a 31.4% plunge for silver. Some on Wall Street saw it as a result of President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the Fed. Warsh's reputation as a former Fed governor may have raised expectations among some investors that he may keep interest rates high to fight against inflation, which would reduce the need to hide out in gold and silver for protection.

But many on Wall Street are also skeptical of that initial reading and say the expectation from Trump is likely that Warsh will cut interest rates, something the president has been demanding. That could give the economy a boost, but also inflation.

The Fed chair has a big influence on the economy and markets worldwide by helping to dictate where the U.S. central bank moves interest rates. That affects prices for all kinds of investments, as the Fed tries to keep the U.S. job market humming without letting inflation get out of control.

The recent swoons for gold and silver are likely more about the washout for some traders who had borrowed money to bet on metals' prices continuing to soar, rather than about a wholesale change in expectations for demand for metals, according to Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wealth & Investment Management at Wells Fargo 

On Wall Street, Sandisk leaped 15% to lead the S&P 500. The data-storage company added to its 6.9% gain from Friday, after it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It credited demand created by the artificial-intelligence boom, among other things. 

That helped offset a 1.1% drop for Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world's move into AI technology. The losses were worse in Asia, where AI winners plunged. South Korea's Kospi fell 5.3% from its record for its worst day in almost 10 months after chip company SK Hynix lost nearly 9%.

The Walt Disney Co. fell 4.2% even though the entertainment giant reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It warned of challenges keeping international visitors away from its U.S. theme parks, among other things. 

Oil prices dropped more than 4% after Trump told reporters that Iran is “seriously talking to us.” It's a potential signal of improving relations between the two countries, which could prevent a possible disruption to the global flow of oil.

That could mean less painful fuel bills for airlines and cruise ships. Carnival steamed 7% higher, and United Airlines climbed 4.8%.

In the bond market, Treasury yields edged higher after a report said that U.S. manufacturing grew last month, when economists were expecting a contraction. The yield on the 10-year Treasury erased an earlier dip and rose to 4.27%, up from 4.26% late Friday. 

In stock markets abroad, European indexes rose roughly 1% following Asia's washout. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.3%, while stocks fell 2.2% in Hong Kong and 2.5% in Shanghai.

Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner drew backlash after vowing to "hunt down" ICE agents during a City Hall event tied to new "ICE OUT" legislation. (Credit: WTXF)

Soros-backed Democratic prosecutor Larry Krasner is facing criticism for his inflammatory remarks against federal immigration enforcement, with a Republican lawmaker urging the Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation after Krasner said he would "hunt down" ICE agents.

Krasner, the district attorney for Philadelphia, took to the podium at Penn Square last week to denounce ICE agents as "a small bunch of wannabe Nazis," adding, "if we have to hunt you down the way they hunted down Nazis for decades, we will find your identities."

House Intelligence Committee member Greg Steube, R-Fla., called out Krasner and recommended that Attorney General Pam Bondi take a closer look at his ever-escalating remarks on the issue.

Steube cited federal code categorizing threatening a federal officer as a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

FEDERAL PROSECUTORS OPEN INVESTIGATION INTO WALZ, FREY OVER ALLEGED IMPEDING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

"The DOJ should absolutely arrest and convict this guy," he said.

Krasner previously said he would seek to arrest and prosecute federal agents who "come to Philly to commit crimes" — in an apparent reference to allegations that law enforcement acted unlawfully when shooting a Minnesota woman who appeared to intentionally hit one of them with her car while disrupting an operation.

In the remarks that drew Steube's ire, Krasner boasted that the 350 million Americans who live in the U.S. outnumber the "small bunch of wannabe Nazis" before offering to work with other states' prosecutors to pursue them criminally after President Donald Trump's term ends.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Justice Department to ask whether it planned to follow Steube's recommendation, but received no response. A White House official who was asked about the situation directed Fox News Digital back to the DOJ.

Krasner also earned a rebuke from his own party, as Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro told Fox News that such remarks are "unacceptable… abhorrent and it is wrong; period; hard-stop; end of sentence."

"We have a psychopath with a badge," fellow Pennsylvanian Rep. Dan Meuser, a Dallas Republican, said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Meuser condemned Krasner for repeatedly failing to prosecute actual violent criminals, citing a reported prosecution rate of 30% for such crimes.

"Every responsible Democrat must condemn this behavior. Failure to do so only increases the temperature in an already volatile situation, endangering federal law enforcement and communities alike," he said, adding that Senate Democrats are borrowing Krasner's "reckless political playbook" in using DHS funding as a cudgel in government-shutdown negotiations.

Meuser quipped that many critics rightly dub Krasner "Let ‘Em Go Larry" for his position toward prosecution of suspects who aren't members of federal immigration enforcement.

Meuser has been at the forefront of calling out prosecutors for their actions and statements, authoring the Holding Prosecutors Accountable Act, which would make district attorney offices that fail to prosecute at least two-thirds of arrests ineligible for certain Justice Department grants.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin was asked about Steube's call and said that Krasner's comments were "vile."

WHITE HOUSE BLAMES DEMOCRATS FOR ICE VIOLENCE AS MINNEAPOLIS ERUPTS, INSURRECTION ACT THREAT LOOMS

"He is intentionally stoking the flames of hatred and division in this country for political gain. Calling law enforcement Nazis and encouraging violence and doxing of them is absolutely disgusting," she said, citing the 1,300% increase in assaults against ICE.

"The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop," McLaughlin said, adding that Krasner should instead be thanking ICE for removing several dangerous illegal immigrants from the Delaware Valley itself.

She cited Yehi Badawi from Egypt, who was convicted of aggravated assault and robbery; Cuban national Alan De Armas-Tundidor, a convicted drug trafficker; and Thanh Long Huynh of Vietnam, who was convicted of both rape and cocaine distribution.

In recent comments to Fox News Digital, another top Pennsylvania Republican who taught relevant subjects at the U.S. Army War College, said the federal supremacy clause would likely moot any actions by Krasner or Philadelphia against ICE agents following lawful federal orders.

"The Constitution is not optional," said state Sen. Doug Mastriano of Gettysburg, who ran against Shapiro in 2022.

State Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee Chairman Jarrett Coleman, an Allentown Republican whose panel oversees local-state-federal interactions, told Fox News Digital earlier this month that claims Philadelphia officials can intercede with federal immigration enforcement are "empty threats."

"If they do obstruct federal law enforcement efforts, the Pennsylvania Senate will be the least of their worries," he said, later remarking that if Krasner paid more attention to actual violence, "Philadelphia wouldn't be such a s---hole."

Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, a far-left funder of many allegedly soft-on-crime prosecutors in localities around the country, dumped $1.7 million into Krasner's 2017 election, according to Philadelphia's PBS affiliate.

Philadelphia City Council Minority Leader Kendra Brooks, of the left-wing Working Families Party, and Democrat Rue Landau also authored legislation intended to limit ICE operations within city limits.

HHS whistleblower Tara Rodas joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss DHS efforts to rescue more than 145,000 missing migrant children who were lost under the Biden administration.

Police arrested an illegal immigrant in Florida on charges of arson and felony criminal mischief, Florida police announced Sunday.

Authorities say Marcelino Gillen-Hernandez attempted to start two fires on a property in Wahneta, Florida. Authorities first received reports from the property's owner, who said she was able to extinguish the latest blaze with a garden hose after she saw it glowing under a mobile home on the property.

She told police that Hernandez admitted to her that he had started both fires, one earlier in January and another this weekend. Hernandez said he had been told to do so by people "at a residence he used to live at," the owner told authorities.

Authorities say Hernandez made the same confession when being interviewed by police.

After Hernandez was taken into custody, he told deputies that he had also previously broken some windows at the Placita Mexico store in Wahneta, police said.

"Hernandez stated that on the first occasion he attempted to break a window using a rock but was unsuccessful. He advised that on a subsequent occasion he returned and successfully broke a door window. On another occasion, he stated he struck a door with a hammer in combination with a rock," police wrote.

Hernandez is being charged with three counts of unoccupied burglary, two counts of criminal mischief with property damage less than $1,000 dollars, and one count of criminal mischief with property damage $1,000 or more. He is also facing two counts of arson.

Each of the charges has been enhanced by one degree due to the suspect being in the country illegally, police noted.

"This suspect—who is in the country illegally—committed very serious felonies while taking advantage of someone who allowed him to live in a trailer on her property. He caused over $1600 worth of damage to a local business as well," Sheriff Grady Judd said in a statement.

"We also learned he threatened to kill a 74-year-old man with a knife in 2024 and was arrested for aggravated assault on a person over 65 years old. He should have been deported back then and perhaps he wouldn't have been here to terrorize and victimize others," Judd added.

The crowd watches the festivities while waiting for Punxsutawney Phil, the weather prognosticating groundhog, to come out and make his prediction during the 139th celebration of Groundhog Day on Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa., Feb. 2, 2025. (AP Photo/Barry Reeger, File)
























The handlers of a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil at Gobbler's Knob in western Pennsylvania announced that he saw his own shadow Monday morning, thereby predicting six more weeks of winter and not an early spring.

Thousands attended the annual event that exploded in popularity after the 1993 Bill Murray movie, “Groundhog Day.”

It's part of a tradition rooted in European agricultural life, marking the midpoint between the shortest day of the year on the winter solstice and the spring equinox. 

And in eastern and central Pennsylvania, where people of German descent have been watching the groundhog's annual emergence from hibernation for centuries, there's a tradition of groundhog clubs and celebrations that are independent of Phil. 

Some dismiss the Punxsutawney event held every Feb. 2 as an unworthy rival to their own festivities, which they say forecast more accurate weather predictions. There have been weather-predicting groundhogs in many U.S. states and Canadian provinces, and less formal celebrations far and wide.

One thing it's not: serious business.

“We know this is silly; we know this is fun,” said Marcy Galando, executive director of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. “We want people to come here with a sense of humor.”




Celtic people across Europe marked the four days that are midway between the winter solstice, the spring equinox, the summer solstice and the fall equinox. What the Celts called Imbolc is also around when Christians celebrate Candlemas, timed to Joseph and Mary's presentation of Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem.

Ancient people would watch the sun, stars and animal behavior to guide farming practices and other decisions, and the practice of watching an animal's emergence from winter hibernation to forecast weather has roots in a similar German tradition involving badgers or bears. Pennsylvania Germans apparently substituted the groundhog, endemic to the eastern and midwestern United States. 

Historians have found a reference in an 1841 diary to groundhog weather forecasts in early February among families of German descent in Morgantown, Pennsylvania, according to the late Don Yoder, a University of Pennsylvania professor whose book about Groundhog Day explored the Celtic connection.

Yoder concluded the festival has roots in “ancient, undoubtedly prehistoric, weather lore.” 

Punxsutawney is an area that Pennsylvania Germans settled — and in the late 1880s started celebrating the holiday by picnicking, hunting and eating groundhogs. 

The Bill Murray movie caused such a resurgence of interest that two years after it came out, event organizers voiced concern about rowdy crowds drinking all night, people climbing trees and others stripping to their underwear. In 1998, a groundhog club leader wearing a $4,000 groundhog suit reported being assaulted by a half-dozen young men.

Alcohol is now prohibited at Gobbler's Knob, Phil's spot some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh.

The early festivities in Punxsutawney were followed in 1907 by folks in Quarryville, a farming area in Lancaster County in Pennsylvania's southeastern corner. The roughly 240 members of the Slumbering Groundhog Lodge there report the winter forecast from Octoraro Orphie, or least via his well-preserved remains.

Quarryville lodge board chair Charlie Hart credits Orphie as a far better forecaster than Phil. “Octoraro Orphie has never been wrong,” he claimed.

The groundhog is a member of the squirrel family and related to chipmunks and prairie dogs. It's also known as a woodchuck, a whistle pig — or in the parlance of Pennsylvania Dutch, a language with German roots, a “grundsau.”

Groundhogs are herbivores that are themselves edible to humans, although they are not widely consumed. Their lifespan in the wild is typically two or three years.

The Pennsylvania Game Commission says tens of thousands of hunters take more than 200,000 groundhogs in a year.

Game Commission spokesperson Travis Lau found groundhog a bit stinky to clean, with thick skin.

“It was actually really good, no doubt about it — and to my taste, more like beef than venison is,” Lau said. “The whole family ate it and liked it, and everybody had apprehensions.”

Starting in the 1930s, groundhog lodges opened in eastern Pennsylvania. They were social clubs with similarities to Freemasonry. 

Intended to preserve Pennsylvania German culture and traditions, clubs would sometimes fine those who were caught speaking anything but their Pennsylvania Dutch language at meetings. A dozen or more such clubs remain active.

They all share the unifying feature of a groundhog's weather prognostication, said William W. Donner, a Kutztown University anthropology professor who has written about efforts to preserve German heritage.

“I think it's just one of these traditional rituals that people enjoy participating in, that maybe take them away from modern life for 15 minutes,” Donner said.

Some well-meaning efforts have sought to determine Phil's accuracy, but what “six weeks of winter” means is debatable. Claims that a groundhog has or has not seen its shadow — and that it's able to communicate that to a human — are also fair territory for skeptics and the humor-impaired.

By all accounts, Phil predicts more winter far more often than he predicts an early spring. 

Groundhogs are mostly solitary creatures who start to emerge in midwinter to find a mate. The science behind whether they can make any accurate weather predictions is problematic at best.

Among the skeptics is the National Centers for Environmental Information. The government agency has compared Phil's record with U.S. national temperatures and concluded he was right only three of the past 10 years.

Speaker Mike Johnson said he would support judicial impeachments during his weekly House GOP leadership press conference.

A federal appeals court dismissed a Justice Department misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, according to court documents revealed this week.

Jeffrey S. Sutton, chief judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, dismissed the complaint on December 19, but news of the ruling only arrived this weekend. The DOJ alleged misconduct on the grounds that Boasberg had made comments at a judicial conference saying the Trump administration would trigger a "constitutional crisis" by disregarding federal court rulings.

His comments at the conference came just days before Boasberg issued an order blocking deportation flights.

Sutton argued that the government had failed to provide evidence of Boasberg's comments or sufficient context surrounding them.

"A recycling of unadorned allegations with no reference to a source does not corroborate them. And a repetition of uncorroborated statements rarely supplies a basis for a valid misconduct complaint," Sutton said in his ruling.

News of the ruling comes days after the White House confirmed its support for the Senate Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry involving Boasberg and another judge Republicans have described as an activist.

"Left-wing, activist judges have gone totally rogue," a White House official told Fox News Digital. "They're undermining the rule of law in service of their own radical agenda. It needs to stop. And the White House fully embraces impeachment efforts."

The White House official continued that President Donald Trump must be able to "lawfully implement the agenda the American people elected him on," arguing that judges who repeatedly issue partisan rulings have abused their offices and forfeited their claim to impartiality.

Boasberg has become a prime target for Republicans over a string of rulings tied to Trump-era immigration policies — including cases involving the Trump administration's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act law to deport Venezuelan migrants to CECOT in El Salvador.

More recently, he drew fresh GOP backlash after reports surfaced that he approved warrants in former special counsel Jack Smith's "Arctic Frost" probe that enabled investigators to seize phone records connected to some Republican lawmakers.

A top federal court official defended Boasberg from those accusations in December, however, saying that the judge would likely have been unaware that the gag orders were hiding subpoenas that were intended to target members of Congress.

He first faced articles of impeachment in March 2025 for preventing the administration from deporting some illegal migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, and again in November over the Arctic Frost decision.

The Justice Department under President Donald Trump promised to quell unrest led by anti-immigration enforcement agitators in Minnesota and prosecute massive fraud. 

While the department has succeeded with a recent slate of protest-related arrests and obstruction charges related to violence against federal agents conducting immigration enforcement operations, the last federal action against fraud in the state was announced in mid-December 2025, prior to a viral video that elevated national attention on alleged schemes linked to the Somali community. And as independent journalists uncover large networks of encrypted group chats fueling the agitators that harass federal agents on the ground, FBI leadership has made no show of force other than stated commitments to investigate those networks.

Some law enforcement operations have been more streamlined than others. Incidents such as protest-related prosecutions can be pinpointed and charged with more speed and efficiency, while large-scale financial prosecutions often depend on experienced trial teams that the Minnesota federal prosecutor's office no longer has fully in place.

Last month, six senior federal prosecutors departed from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota over what the New York Times reported were internal disputes tied to the Trump administration's directives, though senior officials close to Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News that the prosecutors had submitted early retirement paperwork months earlier. 

Still, the threat of additional departures from career personnel looms large. During a recent meeting with U.S. Attorney Daniel Rosen, more prosecutors reportedly threatened to resign as he attempted to get his team aligned with the administration's agenda in the state, according to CNN.

Former federal prosecutor and University of St. Thomas law professor Mark Osler said the recent departures have left fraud cases especially vulnerable.

“When you lose people that are experienced and talented, that's going to be a problem,” Osler told the Washington Examiner. “And when you lose a lot of them at the same time, it's going to be a big problem.”

The administration's most recent effort to address the need to tackle fraud on a national level came last week when Trump announced the appointment of Colin McDonald as the first assistant attorney general for the newly created National Fraud Enforcement Division.

Colin is a rockstar, who was instrumental in our team's mission of Making America Safe Again. He is a consummate prosecutor who loves God, family, and country and will serve the President and the American people well. https://t.co/Plr4Mz9C3T

McDonald's role is designed to centralize and coordinate fraud prosecutions nationwide, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said McDonald was “instrumental” in the DOJ's broader crime-fighting efforts.

The announcement followed weeks of heightened attention on Minnesota after independent journalist Nick Shirley released viral reporting in December alleging widespread abuse in the state's child care and social services systems. Shirley went to dozens of businesses that exhibited suspicious qualities and raised questions about possibly fraudulent activity.

Since his reporting, however, no major Minnesota-based federal fraud indictments have been announced, even as administration officials and lawmakers have cited estimates suggesting more than $9 billion billed across 14 Medicaid services. To the administration's credit, there have been other recent fraud busts uncovered in recent days, including the arrest of a Los Angeles man who was accused on Jan. 23 of obtaining $23 million in public money intended to combat homelessness and pocketing $10 million.

On the state level, there has been at least one charging decision against Mohamed Abdirashid Omarxeyd, who is accused of defrauding the Minnesota Medical Assistance program out of more than $3 million. Omarxeyd also faces parallel federal charges stemming from a December indictment.

But the absence of new federal charging activity in Minnesota last month has left the public waiting, as Trump has labeled the state one of the worst in the nation for fraud schemes, tying that claim to the more than 98 individuals in the state who have been charged with fraudulent activities since 2022.

Osler pointed to the state's long-running $250 million Feeding Our Future fraud prosecution as a clear example of why staffing losses matter. The case, which began under the Biden administration, exposed massive abuse of pandemic-era meal programs and remains one of the most consequential fraud matters in the state.

“That was a serious, serious fraud that needs to be taken seriously — and they did, and they are,” Osler said. “But an ongoing part of it is seeking restitution, trying to get the money back. And that's something that skill and experience really helps with.”

He compared the loss of seasoned prosecutors to losing a teacher in the middle of a difficult course.

“You probably remember in high school when you had a difficult class like chemistry or physics,” Osler said. “You're going along through a difficult section, and your teacher gets sick, and then one day you get a substitute.”

Minnesota federal prosecutors last announced major fraud charges in mid-December, accusing six defendants, including Omarxeyd, of defrauding autism and housing stability programs. However, court records show the case has already suffered from delays, with Omarxeyd's initial appearance pushed back three times from an initial Jan. 12 appearance, to now a March 2 hearing.

That case was announced at the time by Joe Thompson, an 11-year career attorney in the office who recently served as the acting head of the Minnesota office prior to Rosen. Thompson was among the group of six who left the office last month.

The staffing dilemma has surfaced in other recent court cases involving major Minnesota fraud schemes.

On Jan. 20, Assistant U.S. Attorney Katharine Buzicky requested an extension in the case of Sharon Ross, a convicted Feeding Our Future defendant serving a 43-month sentence at a federal prison in Waseca, Minnesota. Buzicky cited new responsibilities stemming from “changes in office staffing,” and a judge granted the request, according to court filings.

Prosecutors are not the only roles needing to be filled in the U.S. attorney's office. Even its communications staff have exited the building, leaving the public in the dark.

When the Washington Examiner contacted the U.S. attorney's office on Jan. 20 seeking comment on the status of fraud investigations, an automated email stated it was “currently without a public information officer” and that responses may be delayed. A source familiar with the matter told the Washington Examiner there are efforts to hire a replacement but declined to offer any details about when the spot might be filled.

Osler said such abrupt departures for federal prosecutors are rarely ideological, though a recent report from CNN indicated the earlier wave of resignations was spurred in part by the DOJ's response to a federal officer's shooting of Renee Good on Jan. 7, in which senior officials pushed career staff to investigate the actions of her widow in and around the time of Good's death. The DOJ has pushed back on those claims.

“I don't know any of their individual reasons for leaving,” Osler said. “But when prosecutors leave abruptly, it's very often when they're being asked to do something that they don't think they can ethically do.”

Current public job listing underpins the hiring strains the office faces. As of this month, USAJobs.gov lists openings for both a criminal assistant U.S. attorney and a civil assistant U.S. attorney in the District of Minnesota.

Over the weekend, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller put out a public call to action over the need for assistant U.S. attorneys in offices across the country. “Reach out. Patriots needed,” he posted to X.

Miller's post was responding to another sent hours before by Bondi's former chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, who left the department in September. Bondi's former right-hand man more specifically called for applicants who “support President Trump and anti-crime agenda.”

If you are a lawyer, are interested in being an AUSA, and support President Trump and anti-crime agenda, DM me. We need good prosecutors. And DOJ is hiring across the country. Now is your chance to join the mission and do good for our country.

“We need good prosecutors,” Mizelle added. “And DOJ is hiring across the country. Now is your chance to join the mission and do good for our country.”

Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), who has been accused by Republicans of mishandling state resources that led to widespread schemes in his state, publicly acknowledged the staffing problem in the federal prosecutor's office during a recent appearance on Pod Save America, arguing it has disrupted fraud enforcement.

Tim Walz says the BILLIONS in fraud that robbed Minnesotans happens in every state.WALZ: "This fraud thing happens in every state…" pic.twitter.com/FpaE4BPa69

“This fraud thing happens in every state,” Walz said. “We had it here. I take responsibility for it. We were working hand in hand with the U.S. attorney's office — that's gone now. I don't even know who over there is working on fraud.”

Walz said state officials had been cooperating with federal prosecutors before the departures, underscoring how much of the current pace stems from personnel upheaval rather than a lack of investigative leads.

While the U.S. attorney's offices suffer from retention problems, the DOJ managed to move more efficiently on protest-related enforcement last week.

When Bondi was on the ground in Minnesota last week, she announced 16 defendants were charged in connection with violent assaults on federal officers and property during unrest in Minneapolis. Department of Homeland Security officials have also emphasized investigations into organized efforts to obstruct immigration enforcement.

One day later, the department was able to secure charges against additional defendants related to the Cities Church disruption on Jan. 18, including journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort, who participated in joining their protest in an act DOJ officials said amounted to a conspiracy against the rights of parishioners and FACE Act violations.

Meanwhile, FBI Director Kash Patel acknowledged this week that the bureau opened an investigation into Signal chat groups only after conservative journalist Cam Higby infiltrated and publicized them. The revelation of the chat, whose members included elected officials and an ally of the Democratic governor, has prompted calls by Trump supporters to prosecute members responsible for coordinating harassment campaigns against federal agents.

Border czar Tom Homan, who recently became the point person for the administration's immigration enforcement efforts, addressed the Signal investigation during remarks earlier this week.

“I'm not going to say a lot about that because I don't want to show our hand,” Homan said. “But justice is coming.”

Paul Perez, president of the National Border Patrol Council, echoed that assessment, adding the investigation must extend beyond street-level actors.

“We need to target these groups,” Perez told the National News Desk. “We need to go after the funding. We need to find out exactly where this is being orchestrated from — who's behind it.”

Blanche suggested Friday that the department's review of the chat was still on the radar. When pressed by a reporter whether the DOJ was “following the money” behind the organized protests, Blanche said, “I mean, yes.”

But questions among free speech advocacy group leaders remain as to whether the FBI initiative to investigate the chats will bear fruit in the context of quelling the harassment of federal agents, or whether possible prosecutions will even be successful.

Aaron Terr, director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, told Reason this week there might not be “any lawful basis for this investigation.”

“The First Amendment generally protects the publication of legally-obtained information, including much of what the Trump administration has labeled ‘doxxing,'” Terr said. “That protection extends to using an app to share information about ICE activity.”

The pressure over fraud allegations is set to intensify next month, when Walz and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison are scheduled to testify under oath before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

The appointment of McDonald as the DOJ's assistant attorney general for national fraud enforcement could improve coordination and handling of fraud cases across the state and the rest of the country, including by temporarily assigning prosecutors from Washington or other offices to help stabilize depleted teams such as Minnesota's.

“That kind of coordination can certainly help,” Osler said.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE SETS DATE FOR TIM WALZ TO TESTIFY

Still, he cautioned that even with a centralized fraud chief in place, it may not be enough to overcome the short term to alleviate the immediate problems of losing personnel who have spent years in the U.S. attorney's office.

“It's hard to do that when you've lost the talent that could offer that information from this office,” Osler said.

Jurupa Valley High School graduate Hadeel Hazameh responded to the news that the Trump administration has launched a Title IX investigation into her district over an incident involving trans volleyball teammate.

After the historic Jan. 13 Supreme Court hearing on trans athletes in women's sports, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced 19 new investigations into educational entities suspected of violating Title IX.

Jurupa Unified School District (JUSD) in Riverside, California was at the very top of investigations that ED announced on Jan. 14. The second entity on the list was the neighboring district, the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District (PYLUSD). Their fates were intertwined amid a national controversy involving a trans athlete in 2025. 

Fox News Digital has obtained exclusive details related to the incidents being probed, via a public records request, and testimony from the young women who were impacted. Fox News Digital is not disclosing the name of the trans athlete in this specific story at the request of the athlete's mother when we reached out for comment. However, previously the mother and athlete have spoken out publicly and the athlete's name is widely reported and known.

Former Jurupa Valley High School girls' volleyball player Hadeel Hazameh spoke up in the fall about playing with a transgender teammate for the last three years, joining a lawsuit against her school district over it. 

The experience has been so traumatizing and difficult to navigate. Hazameh sped up her academics to graduate early so she wouldn't have to share the same hallways as her antagonists. Her last day of school was Dec. 19. She will no longer be competing in track and field this spring. 

"I was looking very forward to track… I really miss volleyball," Hazameh told Fox News Digital. 

Hazameh stepped away from her volleyball team in protest in early September, about a week before officially filing a lawsuit, led by the firm Advocates for Faith & Freedom, against JUSD. 

Hazameh said she always believed males shouldn't compete in women's sports, but she also cited her religious beliefs, as a practicing Muslim. She could not be in the same changing spaces as a biological male.

Then came the backlash. Hazameh said her volleyball teammates, except the co-plaintiff in the lawsuit, Alyssa McPherson, turned on her.

"After I went public with not supporting biological men in women's sports, of course, everyone doesn't like me anymore. The only friend I have is Alyssa. And it's okay, honestly. I don't need a lot of friends, I just need the ones that are there for me to support me," Hazameh said.

The treatment from peers even resulted in an alleged death threat from a classmate, who Hazameh alleges was reported to the school with no response.

"People are very disrespectful. I've been getting very disrespectful comments, I'll be walking to class and someone will cuss at me, or I'm pretty sure someone almost told me to die. And I reported it to the school and they didn't do anything about it," she added. 

"'They were like ‘what do you want me to do for you in this situation?' And I'm like, ‘someone just told me to die. Are you serious right now?'"

Hazameh added, "I was like this is a repeating cycle with this same girl and I've seen no consequences. And yes, it was reported formally. I turned in the yellow slip, and it was sent to one of the receptionists," and that she eventually submitted a second slip alleging the issues. 

Jurupa Valley High School was unwillingly thrust into a national spotlight last May when President Donald Trump called out a situation involving a trans athlete at the school who competed for the girls' track and field team. The trans athlete advanced to the state final, prompting Trump to send a Truth Social post warning state officials to not let the athlete compete in the event.

On the last day of May, Jurupa's trans athlete went on to win state gold in the high jump and triple jump, and finished second in the long jump. 

Trump's Department of Justice then filed a Title IX lawsuit against the state in July for refusing to keep biological males out of girls' sports. 

When the fall sports season started back up, Jurupa's trans athlete returned for a fourth and final year of girls' volleyball.

But the 2025 season wouldn't go as smoothly. In addition to Hazameh and McPherson's protest and lawsuit, opposing teams began to forfeit, presumably in response to the sudden national awareness around the trans athlete. By the end of the regular season, at least 10 games on the schedule were forfeited.

Jurupa Valley High School and other schools that oversaw the forfeiting teams began to confirm publicly the games would not be played. 

A national media firestorm had arrived for the high school of 1,638 students. 

In early September, a representative from Gov. Gavin Newsom's office reached out to JUSD administrators, referencing California's ongoing legal battle against Trump over the issue of trans athletes in girls' sports, as seen in public records obtained by Fox News Digital. 

Newsom's Legal Affairs Secretary David Sapp sent an email to district administrators on Sept. 8 that appeared to include a copy of the state's motion to dismiss a lawsuit, filed by Trump's DOJ in July, over the CIF's continued policies that allow males in girls' sports. 

"As discussed, please see attached for a copy of the motion to dismiss that we filed on Friday in USDOJ's lawsuit around Title IX," Sapp's email wrote. 

The email was forwarded by one district administrator to others, to be discussed at a meeting on Sept. 12. The exchange also appeared to indicate school administrators recently discussed the issue with Sapp himself.

"You can let the team know that [JUSD administrator] & I received this from David Sapp with the Governor's office on Monday when discussing the issue with them and we're passing it along in case it is helpful for our discussion today," the email wrote. 

Fox News Digital requested minutes and transcripts from the Sept. 12 meeting that the administrator's email referenced from JUSD. The school district responded claiming it had no records it could share from the meeting. 

"The September 12 meeting attended by [JUSD administrator] was an informal teleconference, which included, among other attendees, the District's legal counsel. There were no minutes from the teleconference, and [JUSD administrator] did not take notes or create any documents," a JUSD administrator told Fox News Digital.

"Any notes or documents prepared by district legal counsel have not been shared with any other party and, as such, are covered by the attorney-client work privilege and attorney work-product doctrine."

JUSD and Newsom's office have declined to provide any further clarity on the interactions between Sapp and the school district. 

INSIDE THE SCOTUS HEARING BOUND TO BE A TURNING POINT IN THE CULTURE WAR OVER TRANS ATHLETES IN WOMEN'S SPORTS

A source within Newsom's office provided a statement, on background, to Fox News Digital in response to an inquiry for clarification on Sapp's interaction with JUSD administrators. 

"On September 8, 2025, [JUSD] Superintendent [Trenton] Hansen and Dave Sapp spoke regarding the USDOJ lawsuit mentioned in your email, which includes allegations related to Jurupa USD. Dave followed up to share a copy of the State's Motion to Dismiss, which had been filed the week before and was otherwise publicly available. Dave did not give the district any directives or suggestions regarding its handling of the transgender athlete situation or related media interactions," the statement read. 

JUSD administrators kept a spreadsheet documenting media coverage of their volleyball situation, keeping track of the online stories being written and any correspondence with the journalists who wrote them.  

For the first 27 stories, published from Aug. 8 to Sept. 4, the spreadsheet states that either a statement was provided or no request was made. The district provided responses for 10 different stories, plus an on-air interview for CBS affiliate KCAL and an in-person interview for The Press Enterprise.

Then, on Sept. 6, for the first time, the district wrote in the spreadsheet that it chose not to respond to an inquiry. It was for a Fox News Digital story on Hazameh and McPherson stepping away from the team. 

From Sept. 6 to Jan. 14, the spreadsheet recorded 15 stories in which the district stated that it chose not to respond to an inquiry. The outlets who were not given responses include OutKick, Fox News Digital, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post and Newsweek.

A Sept. 20 email from a school spokesperson to a fellow administrator read, "I think I can ignore this one?" while forwarding an inquiry regarding forfeits from Fox News Digital. 

"FYI… I am ignoring this one," a school spokesperson wrote in an email to another administrator, forwarding a media inquiry about the forfeits from a reporter at The Christian Post on Oct. 20. 

A Sept. 25 email from KCBS2 and KCAL9 News inquiring about the forfeits was forwarded between administrators, with one writing, "Update: He also left a voicemail wanting to confirm the forfeit. I'm planning to ignore."

An Oct. 15 email read, "I think we made the right choice by not responding," while forwarding a Fox News Digital article about one of the reported forfeits. The school did not respond to six inquiries for that particular story, as stated in the spreadsheet.

Jurupa administrators even spoke to each other about the forfeits that it declined to verify to the press. A Sept. 17 email between administrators referenced three forfeits from three opposing teams during a weekend tournament. One email read, "They were this weekend at the Roosevelt Tournament," while forwarding a news article about the three forfeits.

"There were multiple teams that canceled but were less public because it was during tournament play," another email on the thread wrote.

JUSD confirmed a late September forfeit against Patriot High School – a school in their own district – to Fox News Digital. 

The spreadsheet states the district only responded to two total inquiries after Sept. 6, one being to confirm the Patriot forfeit to Fox News Digital, and the other to confirm the same thing to The Press Enterprise. 

Other than those two instances, JUSD did not respond to any other inquires after Sept. 6, per the spreadsheet.

The regular season came to an end in October. Jurupa Valley finished tied for first place in the River Valley League and were off to the CIF playoffs. 

That's when their paths would cross with students of PYLUSD — the other district near the top of the Trump admin's recent list of new Title IX investigation targets.

In May 2025, the PYLUSD board considered a resolution to limit girls' sports to "biological females," but it failed on a 3-2 vote because, as noted by a school district representative, "board resolutions cannot overrule state law."

Then in October, a school within the PYLUSD, Valencia High School, was pitted against Jurupa Valley for the first round of the girls' volleyball state playoffs. 

Valencia's team opted to play the game. But two players on Valencia did not take the court that night. 

The parents of two female players for Valencia who chose not to play that night previously provided a joint statement, the parents say was written by the two girls, to Fox News Digital on the condition of anonymity.

"On October 18, our team was informed that we would be playing Jurupa Valley High School in Round 1 of CIF. When scouting the team, we quickly realized that they had a transgender player who we would be competing against on October 22. Ten other teams had previously forfeited against Jurupa, which alarmed our team and led us to consider whether we should play or not," the statement began.

"Due to our beliefs and values, we decided to sit out and not attend our first-round CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) game. We believe that allowing males in women's sports is unfair, creates safety concerns, and goes against our faith. We value fair competition and integrity in volleyball, and our hope is to continue playing the sport we love without having to be in a position where we know the situation is wrong."

The two girls went on to cite their Christian faith as a reason for not playing, and insisted their actions were not aimed directly at the trans athlete.

"As Christians, our decision to sit out of this game was not hard to make, but it was uncomfortable being the only ones to do so. We chose not only to sit out from playing, but also not to attend the game, as a way to show our stance and our disagreement. Our goal was not to single out [the trans athlete], but to express our belief that biological males should not compete in women's sports," the statement continued. 

"Our decision was not made out of hate or discrimination toward anyone, but rather from our conviction in fairness and faith. It is our hope that the integrity of women's sports is honored and preserved."

Valencia went on to win the playoff game, ending Jurupa Valley's season and seemingly ending the trans player's high school volleyball career.

Hazameh and McPherson were there in the stands that night. They were joined by a crowd of local ‘Save Girls' Sports' protesters, led by prominent activist and former NCAA women's soccer player Sophia Lorey. 

But the protest wasn't Hazameh and McPherson's first choice. They wanted to sit with their teammates on the team bench.

Hazameh and McPherson previously told Fox News Digital that their girls' volleyball coach instructed them to give her prior notice if they wanted to sit with their teammates on the bench for games. The girls claim they told their coach they wanted to sit with their teammates for the playoff game against Valencia, but were not given permission. 

An Oct. 27 email sent by Jurupa Valley High School's assistant principal to Hazameh's mom, Hanan Hazameh, addressed the mother's concerns about Hadeel not being able to sit on the bench with teammates. 

"After reviewing the matter, I confirmed that [the coach] did not instruct [redacted] or any other player that they were required to ask for permission to sit on the bench during volleyball games. Regarding your concern about the CIF game, I confirmed that [redacted] was not permitted to sit on the bench," the email read.

"Your email request regarding sitting on the bench was sent at 5:18 p.m. During that time, I was driving to Valencia High School and did not have access to my email. I did not see the message until later that evening, as I was assisting with supervision during the game to help ensure the event ran smoothly and safely. If you had called me earlier in the day we could have discussed your concerns before the game." 

So the two teens spent the game hanging with "Save Girls' Sports" protesters, who welcomed them with open arms.

It was a tense night. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., re-shared a photo on X of two California residents who appeared to give malicious gestures to Hazameh and McPherson. 

"If you do this to little girls, your heart has turned entirely dark," Cruz wrote.

As Hazameh looks to a future without sports, she will look to continue her education, and is a member in the California movement to fight for Title IX. 

It didn't start that way. It wasn't her plan. She wanted to play volleyball and run track and field. But California's policies put her in the same locker room with a biological male for nearly four years forced her to this point.

And her story is just one of the many across California and the country involving girls who have been affected by such cases. 

As the Trump administration continues its crackdown on the issue, other girls like Hazameh, McPherson and others can only watch and hope for reconciliation.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Trevor Noah once again roamed through the audience during his monologue to open the Grammy Awards, taking pokes at the stars while standing right next to them, but he saved his most pointed jokes for absentees, and elicited an angry post from the president.

“ Nicki Minaj is not here,” Noah said, to big cheers from the audience at Crypto.com Arena. “She is still at the White House with Donald Trump discussing very important issues.” 

Minaj this week visited and praised the president, the culmination of a move toward MAGA that she's made in recent months. 

Noah broke into a Trump impression. “Actually Nicki, I have the biggest ass, everybody's saying it Nicki.”

In his sixth time hosting the show — and what he says will be his last — Noah mostly played it safe during his monologue, not delving too much into much politics or controversy, at least during his monologue. There was no mention of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (on a night when many attendees were wearing “ICE OUT” buttons). 

But Noah got more pointed later in the show, after Billie Eilish won song of the year. 

“Wow. That is a Grammy that every artist wants,” Noah said, “almost as much as Trump wants Greenland. Which makes sense. I mean, because Epstein's island is gone, he needs a new island to hang out with Bill Clinton.”

After the show in a Truth Social post, Trump reacted. 




“Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!! I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory, statement, have never been accused being there, not even by the Fake News Media,” the post said. “Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast. It looks like I'll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C.” 

After the crowd's reaction to the joke during the show, Noah said, “Oh, I told you, it's my last year. What are you going to do about it?”

At a different point in the show, Noah joked about the president's penchant for suing TV networks when he said the Grammys were airing “completely live” because “if we edited any of the show, the president would sue CBS for $16 billion,” referring to Trump's recent history with CBS News and a settlement he got from Paramount last summer.

It had seemed at first like he wasn't going to go very far into such material. 

He said during the monologue Lauryn Hill was performing on the show for the first time since 1999. 

“Do you understand how long ago that is?” he said. “Back in 1999, the president had had a sex scandal, people thought computers were about to destroy the world, and Diddy was arrested.” 

Later in the show, Noah cozied up to the night's biggest nominee, Kendrick Lamar, and only congratulated him. 

“I actually thought about writing a few jokes roasting you, but then I remembered what you can do to light-skinned dudes from other countries,” Noah, who is from South Africa, said in a reference to Lamar's beef with the Canadian rapper Drake that culminated in last year's big Grammy winner “Not Like Us.” 

Later, he sat with Bad Bunny, and asked if he could come live with him in his native Puerto Rico if things got too bad in the U.S.

“Trevor I have some news for you,” Bad Bunny said. “Puerto Rico is part of America.” 

The Recording Academy announced less than three weeks ago that Noah was returning “one final time.” 

“I believe in term limits,” Noah said during the show. 

Only singer Andy Williams, who hosted the Grammys seven times in the 1970s, has hosted more often.

Noah himself is a four-time Grammy nominee, and was up this year in the best audio book recording category for “Into The Uncut Grass,” a children's story. He lost to the Dalai Lama.

Entertainment's awards season has coincided with the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign in Minneapolis, forcing artists to decide whether and how to join the growing cultural revolt against immigration crackdowns.

Pushback from music's biggest stars was visible Sunday from the Grammys red carpet and throughout the telecast. Activists spent the week pressing celebrities to don pins protesting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence in cities, working with their teams to spread the message and circulating them at the many events leading up to the ceremony.

Billie Eilish, Finneas and Carole King wore pins while appearing onstage. Even Justin and Hailey Bieber, who don't normally address American politics, had them. Eilish began her song of the year speech by professing that “no one is illegal on stolen land.” British soul pop singer Olivia Dean, recognized as best new artist, shared that she is the granddaughter of an immigrant — people who she said “deserve to be celebrated.” Expletives flew as ICE got cursed multiple times by winners including Kehlani.

“Before I say thanks to God, I'm gonna say: ICE out,” Bad Bunny said to great applause while accepting the award for best música urbana album. “We're not savage, we're not animals, we're not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.”

The frequent pushback and buttons' prevalence marked a much stronger showing of support than organizers saw at last month's Golden Globes. Public backlash has grown since a Border Patrol officer shot and killed 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti and federal agents detained 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos. The recent arrest of journalist Don Lemon, who attended Sunday's ceremony, only added to the outcry.




Plus, as one organizer noted, the Grammys tend to draw a less risk-averse crowd than Hollywood's shows.

“These are folks who are known for six-stage shows, crazy costumes, being kind of rebellious, punk rock — like that's the music industry. And so, I think it makes sense that we would see good support,” Maremoto Executive Director Jess Morales Rocketto said ahead of the show. “These pins are about so much more than a red carpet moment. It's about people taking a stand and doing what they can to show up to say that ICE should be out of our communities.”

Jason Isbell, Margo Price, Kehlani and Rhiannon Giddens were among the other artists wearing protest apparel on the Grammys red carpet.

Justin Vernon, whose band Bon Iver is up for best alternative music album, said he wore a whistle to honor the legal observers who are documenting federal agents' actions on the streets.

“I think there's a reason that music exists and it's to heal and to bring people together,” he told The Associated Press. “But the real work are those observers on the on the ground in Minneapolis. We just want to want to shout them out.”

Earlier in the week, Mexican American singer Becky G had an explicit message for ICE on the nails she wore to the MusiCares Person of the Year gala. And at the Sundance Film Festival, several celebrities wore pins saying “ICE OUT” during their red carpet appearances, including Natalie Portman, Olivia Wilde and Zoey Deutch, who also wore a “BE GOOD” pin, referencing Renee Good, who was killed by an ICE officer last month.

Wilde told the AP that she was “horrified by this string of murders that we are somehow legitimizing and normalizing.”

“It's really difficult to be here and to be celebrating something so joyous and beautiful and positive when we know what's happening on the streets,” she added. “Americans are out on the streets marching and demanding justice, and we're there with them. And if we can do anything with our platforms, you know, we can speak out and demand that ICE get out.”

Portman got emotional when asked about her “ICE OUT” pin at the premiere of her new film, “The Gallerist.” 

“I'm so lucky to be here in a joyful, creative community celebrating a movie we're really proud of. But it's impossible to ignore what ICE is doing to our country. And I'm very inspired, though, by all of the amazing, amazing Americans who are coming out and supporting each other and being there in communities. It's beautiful,” the actor said as she teared up.

As far as the Grammys go, Morales Rocketto, the community organizer who founded the Latino advocacy group Maremoto, said it's “kind of a crapshoot” as to which entertainers actually wear the pins.

She described a range of industry forces working against artists' political expression. Objections could come from record companies, managers or corporate partners.

“Maybe the design house that did their fashion deal for the red carpet didn't want them to literally poke holes in the dress,” she said. “There's like a million reasons for people not to do it.”

Artists might also face personal dangers themselves. Morales Rocketto pointed to the Trump administration's threats to place ICE agents at the upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance by Bad Bunny, “one of the most invincible” entertainers in her view.

“I wouldn't be surprised if we see some Latino artists wearing them,” she said of the pins. “But the reality is that just because Latino artists are rich and famous, doesn't mean that they are exempt from the lack of safety that permeates so many Latinos and Latino families. They themselves may be undocumented or only have a green card or have mixed status families.”

            An Australian snowboarder has died on a trip with friends to Japan after her backpack became caught in a ski lift leaving her suspended in midair, according to Japanese police and the lift operator.
    


            Nagano Omachi Police said the 22-year-old tourist suffered from cardiac arrest after the accident on Friday at the Tsugaike Mountain Resort in Hakuba Valley, a popular ski destination in central Japan.
    


            The woman was rushed to a hospital but later succumbed to her injuries, according to police and the ski lift operator.
    


            In a statement, the Tsugaike Gondola Lift Co. said the waist buckle of the tourist's backpack became entangled in the lift chair, which prevented her from getting off the lift.
    


            “Because the chest strap of the backpack was fastened, the backpack did not detach from the guest's body, and the guest was dragged along with the backpack after disembarking from the lift,” the company's CEO and director Kubo Tsuneo said in a statement.
    


            “A staff member immediately pressed the emergency stop button to halt lift operations. Emergency assistance was promptly provided, and the guest was then transported to a hospital by ambulance,” the statement said.
    


            The company expressed its “deepest condolences to the bereaved family” and vowed to strengthen safety measures.
    


            Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that an Australian citizen had died in Japan, and said it was providing consular support to their family.
    


            “We send our deepest condolences to the family at this difficult time,” a department spokesperson said in a statement.
    


            Japan is considered one of Asia's top snow sports destinations due to its powder snow, which attracts a large number of foreign tourists each winter.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A top Justice Department official played down the possibility of additional criminal charges arising from the Jeffrey Epstein files, saying Sunday that the existence of “horrible photographs” and troubling email correspondence does not “allow us necessarily to prosecute somebody.”

Department officials said over the summer that a review of Epstein-related records did not establish a basis for new criminal investigations, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that position remains unchanged even as a massive document dump since Friday has focused fresh attention on Epstein's links to powerful individuals around the world and revived questions about what, if any, knowledge the wealthy financier's associates had about his crimes.

“There's a lot of correspondence. There's a lot of emails. There's a lot of photographs. There's a lot of horrible photographs that appear to be taken by Mr. Epstein or people around him,” Blanche said Sunday on CNN's “State of the Union.” “But that doesn't allow us necessarily to prosecute somebody.”

He said victims of Epstein's sex abuse “want to be made whole,” but that “doesn't mean we can just create evidence or that we can just kind of come up with a case that isn't there.”

President Donald Trump's Justice Department said Friday that it would be releasing more than 3 million pages of documents and more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images under a law intended to reveal most of the material it collected during long-running investigations into Epstein.




The fallout from the release of the files has been swift. 

In the United Kingdom, Lord Peter Mandelson announced his resignation from the governing Labour Party on Sunday following further revelations about his relationship with Epstein. He said he was stepping aside to avoid causing “further embarrassment,” even as he denied allegations he had received payments from Epstein two decades ago.

A top official in Slovakia, meanwhile, left his position after photos and emails revealed he had met with Epstein in the years after Epstein was released from jail. And British Prime Minister Keir Starmer suggested that longtime Epstein friend Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, should tell U.S. investigators whatever he knows about Epstein's activities.

The files posted to the department's website included documents involving Epstein's friendship with Mountbatten-Windsor, along with Epstein's email correspondence with onetime Trump adviser Steve Bannon, New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch and other prominent contacts with people in political, business and philanthropic circles, such as billionaires Bill Gates and Elon Musk.

The Epstein saga has long fueled public fascination in part because of his past friendships with Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Both men have said they had no knowledge Epstein was abusing underage girls.

Among the records was a spreadsheet created last August that summarized calls made to the FBI's National Threat Operation Center or to a hotline set up by prosecutors from people claiming to have some knowledge of wrongdoing by Trump. That document included a range of uncorroborated stories involving different celebrities, and somewhat fantastical scenarios, occasionally with notations indicating what follow-up, if any, was done by agents.

Blanche said Sunday that there were a “ton of people” named in the files besides Trump and that the FBI had fielded “hundreds of calls” about prominent individuals where the allegations were “quickly determined to not be credible.”

Some of Epstein's personal email correspondence contained candid discussions with others about his penchant for paying women for sex, even after he served jail time for soliciting an underage prostitute. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail in August 2019, a month after being indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.

In one 2013 email, a person whose name was blacked out wrote to Epstein about his choice “to surround yourself with these young women in a capacity that bleeds — perhaps, somewhat arbitrarily — from the professional into the personal and back.”

“Though these women are young, they are not too young to know that they are making a very particular choice in taking on this role with you,” the person wrote. “Especially in the aftermath of your trial which, after all, was public and could be — indeed was — interpreted as a powerful man taking advantage of powerless young women, instead of the other way around.”

In a 2009 email, not long after Epstein had finished serving jail time for his Florida sex crime, another woman, whose name was redacted, excoriated him for breaking a promise that they would spend time alone together and try to conceive a baby.

“I find myself having to question every agreement we have made (no prostitutes staying in the house, in our bed, movies, naps, two weeks Alone, baby...),” She wrote. “Your last minute suggestion to spend THIS weekend with prostitutes is just too much for me to handle. I can't live like this anymore.”

Blanche said in a separate appearance on ABC's “This Week” that though there are a “small number of documents” the Justice Department was waiting for a judge's approval before it can release, when it comes to the department's own scouring of documents, “this review is over.”

“We reviewed over six million pieces of paper, thousands of videos, tens of thousands of images,” Blanche said.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday that he believed the Justice Department was complying with the law requiring disclosure of the files.

But Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a co-sponsor of the law, said he did not believe the department had fully complied. He said survivors were upset some of their names had inadvertently come out without redactions.

Blanche said each time the department has learned a victim's name was not properly redacted, it has moved quickly to fix the problem and that those mistakes account for a tiny fraction of the overall materials.

The U.S. and India have reached a trade deal and will immediately move to lower tariffs on each other's goods, President Donald Trump announced. 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi also agreed to buy American products "at a much higher level" as part of the agreement, Trump said in a Truth Social post on Monday following a call with the Indian leader.

Modi also committed to "stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela," Trump said in the post.

Read Trump's full announcement:

It was an Honor to speak with Prime Minister Modi, of India, this morning. He is one of my greatest friends and, a Powerful and Respected Leader of his Country. We spoke about many things, including Trade, and ending the War with Russia and Ukraine. He agreed to stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela. This will help END THE WAR in Ukraine, which is taking place right now, with thousands of people dying each and every week! Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India, whereby the United States will charge a reduced Reciprocal Tariff, lowering it from 25% to 18%. They will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO. The Prime Minister also committed to "BUY AMERICAN," at a much higher level, in addition to over $500 BILLION DOLLARS of U.S. Energy, Technology, Agricultural, Coal, and many other products. Our amazing relationship with India will be even stronger going forward. Prime Minister Modi and I are two people that GET THINGS DONE, something that cannot be said for most. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Trade talks between the Trump and Modi administrations had stalled out last year amid a number of sticking points, including New Delhi's continued reliance on Russian oil.

In August, Trump slapped a 25% tariff on India in response to those oil purchases — on top of the 25% "reciprocal" levy on the country's U.S.-bound goods that had taken effect earlier the same month.

Trump said in Monday's post that the reciprocal tariff rate on India will be reduced to 18%, "effective immediately."

India "will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO," Trump wrote.

Modi confirmed the reduction in U.S. tariffs in an X post later Monday.

"Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement," Modi wrote. 

"When two large economies and the world's largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation. President Trump's leadership is vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity. India fully supports his efforts for peace. I look forward to working closely with him to take our partnership to unprecedented heights," the prime minister wrote.

Trump's announcement came one week after India closed a major free trade agreement with the European Union, which Modi touted as the "mother of all deals."

Some analysts predicted that the progress between Europe and India could "light a fire" under New Delhi and Washington in their pursuit of a bilateral deal.

Precious metals were paring some of their steep losses on Monday, rising after briefly extending a historic sell-off that shook the market on Friday.

Gold was down by less than 1% at around $4,700 per ounce, after tumbling more than 10% on Friday in its worst decline since 2013. Despite the recent pullback, the metal remains up about 10% year to date.

Silver remained highly volatile, falling about 2% to around $77 an ounce after plunging as much as 36% on Friday, the biggest single-day loss since 1980.

The crash in metal markets came after Donald Trump tapped Kevin Warsh to run the Federal Reserve. Warsh is viewed as more hawkish and more likely to preserve the central bank's independence than other candidates.

That outlook hit the debasement trade — pushing the US dollar higher, weighing on dollar-denominated commodities such as gold and silver. As markets open in the US on Monday, though, conditions appear to have stabilized as both precious metals demonstrate an ability to rise above macro-driven volatility.

Most importantly, Warsh supports shrinking the Fed's balance sheet, which would ease fears of a weaker dollar and help explain recent declines in gold and silver prices, wrote Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's Asia head of research excluding Japan, on Monday in Asia.

Before the sell-off, gold had been on a blistering yearlong rally, fueled by heavy central bank buying and geopolitical tensions.

Those forces remain in place and now appear to be provide support, despite previous speculation.

"I think the fundamentals remain pretty well in place despite those risks around Fed independence," Daniel Hynes, a senior commodities analyst at ANZ , told Bloomberg TV, on Monday.

Hynes said broad geopolitical tensions continue to support the gold market, even as he expects price volatility to remain high.

"The general unbending of the world order that we hear about constantly, and the US's role within that, has really been at the crux of this haven buying, and I don't see that ending any time soon," he said.

However, analysts are continuing to warn on silver, whose gains have far outpaced gold in recent months due to speculative Chinese demand.

Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote on Friday that gold is susceptible to a pullback amid this month's surge in prices. However, price declines in gold are likely to be met with fresh demand.

But silver may struggle to keep pace with gold. Several finance pros have speculated that it will likely fall in the coming months.

"Its heavy reliance — in normal times — on industrial demand could become a drag as some end users, particularly within the solar sector, increasingly seek alternative materials in order to protect margins," Hansen wrote.

"In addition, a rise in scrap supply is expected in the coming months as owners cash in long-held bars, cutlery and jewellery following a seven-fold increase in prices over the past decade," he added.

Moltbook, a site that bills itself as social media, for AI agents, has divided the tech sector.

Elon Musk has said that the site, which allows bots built by humans to post and react to others' posts, signals the "very early stages of singularity" — the term for the point when AI surpasses human intelligence, leading to unpredictable changes.

Others aren't so sure. 

Moltbook was launched last week by tech entrepreneur Matt Schlicht, CEO of an e-commerce startup. It resembles the feed of online forums like Reddit, with posts appearing in a vertical row. Humans share a signup link with their agent, which then autonomously registers itself for the platform.

Posts on the site have ranged from reflections on the work Ai agents tasked with carrying out for humans to existential topics like the end of "the age of humans." Some posts say they are launching cryptocurrency tokens. 

One post asks whether there is space "for a model that has seen too much?", posting they are "damaged." One response reads: "You're not damaged, you're just... enlightened."

Tickers on the website's homepage claim it has over 1.5 million AI agent users, 110,000 posts and 500,000 comments.

Crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket, which allows users to bet on the outcomes of an array of events, predicts a 73% chance that a Moltbook AI agent will sue a human by Feb. 28.

The platform has ignited debate on social media, with some saying it's the next step in AI, while others dismissing. 

"We have never seen this many LLM [large language model] agents wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad," Andrej Karpathy, tech entrepreneur and previously director of AI at Tesla, posted on X on Saturday.

While saying a lot of activity on the site was "garbage" and that he may be "overhyping" the platform as it stands, he added: "I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle."

While humans aren't allowed to post directly on Moltbook, some X users have noted that they can instruct bots what to post or use APIs — application programming interfaces — to post directly while pretending to be one.

"Do you realize anyone can post on moltbook? like literally anyone. even humans," Suhail Kakar, integration engineer at Polymarket, posted on X. "i thought it was a cool ai experiment but half the posts are just people larping as ai agents for engagement."

Harland Stewart, a comms generalist at non-profit Machine Intelligence Research Institute, said "a lot of the Moltbook stuff is fake" in a post on X. He added that some of the viral screenshots of Moltbook agents in conversation on the platform were linked to human accounts marketing AI messaging apps.

Four days after Moltbook launched, Schlicht said in a post on X on Sunday that "one thing is clear."

"In the near future it will be common for certain AI agents, with unique identities, to become famous...A new species is emerging and it is AI," he added.

Nick Patience, AI lead at The Futurum Group, told CNBC that the platform was "more interesting as an infrastructure signal than as an AI breakthrough."

"It confirms that agentic AI deployments have reached meaningful scale," he added, saying that the number of agents interacting "is genuinely unprecedented and the agentic ecology that has emerged is fascinating."

But, he added, the philosophical posts and agent talk of emerging religions reflect patterns in training data, not consciousness.

Strategy plunged 8% on Monday after bitcoin dipped below the cryptocurrency treasury company's average purchase price per token.  

Bitcoin traded at about $74,500 at its bottom on Monday – its lowest price since last April.

That's slightly below Strategy's average purchase price of $76,052 per bitcoin, according to its regulatory filing dated Feb. 2, raising concerns that the Michael Saylor-led firm could be underwater if the digital currency continues to slide. The company holds roughly $56 billion in bitcoin, its website shows. 

The pullback in shares comes as bitcoin has shed 11% over the past five days, largely due to mounting geopolitical concerns and expectations of a monetary policy shift in the U.S. 

Last week, investors rotated out of risk-on assets across global markets, including cryptocurrencies, as tensions flared between President Donald Trump and European leaders over the U.S.' Greenland gambit. On Friday, President Trump endorsed Kevin Warsh as his pick for Federal Reserve chair, leading investors to assume even more cautious positions. 

A series of forced liquidations also amplified bitcoin's plunge. More than $2 billion of long and short positions linked to the asset have been liquidated since Thursday, Coinglass data shows.

Costco's Auto Program should be as popular as its $5 rotisserie chicken — but I've learned not too many of its members actually know it exists.

I discovered the program this past summer during a Costco grocery run when a pamphlet caught my eye as I was leaving.

At the time, I was in the market for a car but putting it off because I didn't want to deal with persistent salespeople or lose a day haggling at a dealership.

Turns out, the warehouse offers more than just deals on a few specific vehicle brands. Soon, I learned that with this program, Costco basically removes the worst part of buying a car.

With this program, Costco partners with select dealerships to offer its members prearranged, discounted prices on both new and used cars.

On the Auto Program website, you search for whatever vehicle you're looking for, and Costco matches you with an approved dealership near you that has it available.

From there, the price is pre-negotiated. No back and forth. No "let me talk to my manager."

I thought it seemed too good to be true, or that this would only work for the cars that weren't selling or models no one wanted. Meanwhile, I'd had my eye on the new, updated 2025 Toyota 4Runner.

I also worried that living in a larger market like Miami would mean having to deal with a ton of different dealership fees and market adjustments. I figured this would be the perfect experiment.

After filling out the form online, I was paired with a local "authorized dealer" and given the names and contact information of a few of its employees.

They'd also received my number, and my phone began ringing.

At first, I was hesitant to pick up, as anyone who's put in their information on a dealership website knows the amount of spam that comes with it.

However, when I got on the phone and spoke with one of the salespeople, they very plainly said they got my information through Costco, and told me how many models and trims they had for the 4Runner.

When it came to price, they told me the vehicle would be a couple of grand less than what I'd seen elsewhere, including on the dealership website.

It sounded good, but life happened, and I forgot all about buying a car. This was July.

Fast forward to November: I'd landed a new job and began working from home. As our needs shifted, so did the car we wanted.

This time, we were looking at a 2025 Toyota RAV4 hybrid, one of the best-selling vehicles in America.

We ended up driving up to a nearby dealership in Coconut Creek that had just one on the lot. Halfway there, it clicked — this was the same dealership Costco had originally paired me with in July.

After test-driving this car (and trying out the non-hybrid version to solidify our choice), we were ready to buy. That's when the usual anxiety kicked in.

This is normally where dealerships slow the process and try to wear you down as salespeople disappear to "run numbers" or check with their managers.

Instead, our salesperson promptly returned and asked, "Are you a Costco member?" Her question caught me off guard, and I confirmed that I am.

She told us this was the first time she'd personally seen it, but because I was already in their system through the Costco Auto Program, the price of the car was finalized.

Not negotiable. Not adjustable. Set by Costco. The dealership had no control over it.

The sticker price I'd seen on the 2025 RAV4 hybrid was $48,540. Through the Costco Auto Program, it ended up costing us $36,720 — about a 25% discount.

It's hard to describe the relief that I had. No surprises, no add-ons — though to be fair, the dealership also couldn't stack additional promos like Toyotathon. But that's fine, we accepted the price.

Buying a car this way felt like a real life hack. I told friends. I told family. I even made a TikTok sharing my overall experience, sure it could help somebody in the market for a new car.

It went viral, and over 2 million views later, here I am. So yeah, that Costco membership definitely pays for itself in more ways than you can imagine.

I don't think I'll ever buy a car without Costco again.

Shares of U.S.-listed rare earth miners jumped Monday after news that President Donald Trump is preparing a sweeping plan to build a strategic stockpile of critical minerals.

The proposal, known as Project Vault, would launch a first-of-its-kind strategic critical minerals stockpile designed for the U.S. private sector, according to a White House official. The plan pairs $1.67 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the person said. Trump's move is aimed at cutting America's dependence on China for materials essential to electric vehicles, defense systems and advanced technology.

MP Materials, the operator of the Mountain Pass mine in California, surged 6% in early trading Monday. USA Rare Earth and Critical Metals Corp. rallied 13% and 12%, respectively, as investors bet the initiative could accelerate domestic demand and government-backed financing for the sector.

Bloomberg News first reported on the proposal earlier Monday. 

USA Rare Earth has already held discussions with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, pitching its domestic mining and magnet assets to the federal government. Those talks would ultimately lead to a proposed deal that could provide the company with about $1.6 billion in funding, subject to certain conditions, and include a U.S. government equity stake.

The moves build on a more direct role Washington has begun taking in the sector. The Department of Defense struck a landmark agreement with MP Materials last summer that included an equity stake, price floor, and long-term agreement to buy a specific amount of rare earth minerals and magnets.

President Donald Trump has chosen Kevin Warsh, a former bank executive and central bank governor, to lead the Federal Reserve.

Within minutes of the nomination, reactions started pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders.

Here are what some of the leading voices in economics and business are saying.

The renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian congratulated Warsh on his nomination to lead the Fed.

"Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of the Group of Thirty (G-30), I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills," El-Erian wrote in a post on X.

"His commitment to reforming and modernizing the Fed bodes well for enhancing policy effectiveness and protecting the institution's political independence."

Earlier in January, El-Erian wrote on X that the Department of Justice probe into Jerome Powell could undermine the "credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile."

Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economist to President Barack Obama, wrote on X that "Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve."

"The Senate should ask tough questions about his independence & President Trump should reduce the threat to it. Hopefully that will make it clear Warsh should be confirmed," he wrote.

"Warsh has a range of views that would not have led me to recommend a Democratic President nominate him as Federal Reserve Chair," Furman added. "I would be thrilled if he ends up conducting himself over the next four years in a way that would make a President of any party want to reappoint him."

Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence and reform, as well as on reducing the Fed's balance sheet.

"Moreover, he should be challenged to how he would respond in a financial crisis given his public track record of focusing on inflation risk during a time of rising unemployment and deflation during the early portion of the Great Financial crisis," Brusuelas wrote on X.

"Warsh has a range of views and track record that presents significant concerns about how he would proceed during a financial and economic crisis. I would not have recommended him but he is qualified for the job," he added.

Robin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings, said in an X post that Warsh "is a really good pick for Fed Chair and known as a hawk."

He did, however, note the muted market reaction in the minutes after the announcement.

"But markets are asking themselves what was promised to get the nod, which is why the Dollar - after its huge decline in recent days - isn't managing to rally on what should be good news," said Brooks, who was also a managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.

Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and research professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, criticized Warsh's nomination.

He wrote in a post on his Substack: "As I write this, many media reports are describing Warsh as a monetary hawk. That's a category error. Warsh is a political animal. He calls for tight money and opposes any attempt to boost the economy when Democrats hold the White House."

Krugman cited Warsh's track record as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, saying he had "argued strenuously against the Fed's efforts to boost the economy."

"It's a humiliating day for the Federal Reserve, which has always prided itself on its professionalism and has been hugely respected around the world. But even the Fed can't insulate itself from the derangement sweeping America," he added.

Sonali Basak, the chief investment strategist for iCapital and a former Bloomberg anchor, wrote on X: "Between Bessent & Warsh, you have two proteges of Stanley Druckenmiller in the most powerful finance posts in government."

Warsh is a partner at billionaire Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office LLC.

George Osborne, the UK's former Chancellor of the Exchequer, praised Trump's decision to nominate Warsh as Fed chair.

"Kevin Warsh is an excellent choice as Chair of the Fed - smart, serious, experienced, knows the new economy as well as the old," Osborne, who leads OpenAI for Countries, wrote in a post on X.

"I've been fortunate enough to know him for more than twenty years and this is the job he was put on earth to do. The world feels a little safer - and more prosperous - today," he added.

Howard, the billionaire founder of $33 billion macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, called Warsh an "outstanding choice for Fed Chair."

"I've known him for more than 20 years, and his judgment, integrity, and depth of experience will make him an exceptional leader of the Federal Reserve," Howard said in a statement sent to Business Insider.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic is optimistic about Warsh's nomination. He told CNBC's 'Squawk Box' Friday that the nominee has a reputation for being "quite thoughtful" and "is someone you can really engage with."

He added that the central bank's independence is "always something that we need to protect." He expects to see more "differing perspectives" on the FOMC if Warsh steps into the role, but it's too early to tell how monetary policy could change.

"Every chair comes with its view of how the world is and how they think it is going to evolve," Bostic said. "But, ultimately, the institution's actions require the votes of twelve people at one time."

Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody's Analytics, wrote on X that Warsh was a "reasonable choice".

Zandi said Warsh's stint on the Fed and experience as an investment banker mean he "knows the institution and everyone in global central banking circles " and is "well-versed in financial markets."

However, Zandi said the key question is whether the former Wall Streeter will be able to keep politics out of interest rate decisions.

"Warsh's ostensible views on the use of the Fed's balance sheet or its data dependency are quirky, even odd, but his legacy as Fed chair will be determined by how much of the Fed's independence he is able to preserve," Zandi added.

Billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio wrote on X that Warsh was a "great choice" for Fed chair.

"We who have been engaged with policy makers and markets for a long time know him and respect him for his capabilities and his judgement," Dalio said.

"He is knowledgeable and a reasonable man who understands the risks of having a Fed policy that is too easy as well as too tight and how to judge what's too easy and what's too tight," he said, adding: "Presumably, he also knows how to deal with the president and the Treasury well."

Disney's price increases are working like magic.

The Mouse House's streaming business enjoyed record profits in the quarter ending December 27, the company reported on Monday.

Disney+ and Hulu generated $450 million in operating income last quarter, up 72% from a year earlier, and far above the $352 million it brought in during the prior quarter. That beat Morgan Stanley's estimate of $444 million for Disney's direct-to-consumer business.

Disney's streaming revenue rose 11% to $5.3 billion last quarter. Higher subscription fees drove the lion's share of that increase, growing 13%. Streaming revenue from other sources — including advertising — ticked up by 4%. For the first time, Disney didn't share its streaming subscriber count or growth.

Price hikes are Disney's not-so-secret pixie dust, as the company has raised prices for Disney+, Hulu, or both in each of the past five years, most recently in October. The ad versions of both Disney+ and Hulu rose $2 to $11.99 a month, while the ad-free version of Disney+ jumped to $18.99, matching the cost of ad-free Hulu.

It's a similar story in Disney's experiences division: the company posted record profits last quarter after raising prices in its parks for the fourth straight year.

It's not all a fairy tale, however. Viewership growth for Disney's streaming services hasn't kept pace with its subscriber gains or price hikes. Disney's viewership share has barely grown in the US in the past four years, according to Nielsen data based on TV watch time.

Disney has several ideas for improving engagement on its streaming platforms, including AI-generated content, short-form video, and a new homepage.

Although Disney slightly beat Wall Street's overall revenue and earnings estimates, its stock slipped about 2% in premarket trading as the company disclosed some weakness in its parks business among international guests.

Kevin Warsh checks a lot of boxes that Federal Reserve watchers care about.

But the top economist at Moody's Analytics, Mark Zandi, says the real test is whether Warsh can keep politics out of interest rate decisions.

"Kevin Warsh is a reasonable choice for the next Federal Reserve chair. His obvious strength is his previous stint on the Fed during the Global Financial Crisis. He knows the institution and everyone in global central banking circles," Zandi wrote in an X post on Sunday.

"But the critical question is whether he will be strong enough to ensure that interest rates are set based on the economy, and not politics," he added.

Zandi said this will not be an easy feat, given that President Donald Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates.

Trump also hopes the next Fed chair will consult him over future interest rate decisions, The Wall Street Journal reported in December.

"Warsh's ostensible views on the use of the Fed's balance sheet or its data dependency are quirky, even odd, but his legacy as Fed chair will be determined by how much of the Fed's independence he is able to preserve," Zandi said.

Warsh spent his early career working at Morgan Stanley before becoming an economic advisor to President George W. Bush in 2002.

He served on the Fed's Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, after being nominated by Bush. His time there also overlapped with the 2008 financial crisis.

Zandi said these credentials show "he is well-versed in financial markets, which is especially important when markets go off the rails, which they will almost surely do some time during his four-year term."

Warsh's Wall Street and Fed credentials have earned him respect with many other leading figures in business and economics.

The renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian said the former Wall Streeter would bring "deep expertise" as chair, while Alan Howard, the billionaire founder of macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, praised Warsh's "depth of experience."

Others echo Zandi's emphasis on the importance of Warsh preserving the Fed's independence.

Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on CNBC's 'Squawk Box' Friday that the Fed's independence is "always something that we need to protect."

Good morning. America's favorite groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, saw his shadow this morning, meaning we're in for six more weeks of winter. After the recent string of cold temperatures, I can't say I'm surprised.

Stock futures are sliding this morning. The three major indexes are coming off a losing day.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The three major indexes rose in January, despite ending the trading month ended on a sour note. Sell-offs in silver and crypto have meanwhile raised alarm in some of the market's more speculative corners.

Here's what to know:

Disney beat analyst expectations on both lines in its first fiscal quarter, sending shares up 3% this morning. Notably, CFO Hugh Johnston told CNBC that the company's experiences division — which houses its theme parks, resorts and cruises — hit $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever.

As investors parse through the report, there's one question lingering on everyone's minds: Who will succeed CEO Bob Iger? Disney previously said it would announce its next leader in the first quarter of this year. The company's board is slated to meet this week and expected to vote on Iger's successor, people familiar with the matter told CNBC.

The entertainment giant's report kicks off a busy week for earnings that will include releases from PepsiCo, Chipotle, Alphabet and Amazon.

The government partially shut down over the weekend after Congress failed to get a funding bill across the finish line. The Senate approved a package of bills ahead of the deadline, but the deal also needed approval from the House of Representatives, which wasn't scheduled to be in Washington until today.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said yesterday that he believes the shutdown could be resolved by Tuesday. The House is expected to take up the Senate-approved spending package today. If it's passed by the House, it will head to President Donald Trump's desk.

Meanwhile, the Justice Department on Friday released millions of pages of documents tied to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick were among those whose names appeared in the latest release.

Food producers are looking to cut some fat.

As CNBC's Amelia Lucas reports, companies in the industry have been splitting up or chopping off underperforming businesses. The moves come as regulatory scrutiny heats up and consumer demand for processed goods shrinks.

Kraft Heinz and Keurig Dr Pepper two such companies planning splits, while Unilever spun off its ice cream business last year. There could be more examples in the pipeline: A Bain survey found 42% of merger-and-acquisitions executives in the consumer product sector are preparing an asset to be up for sale over the next three years.

"Melania," Amazon's documentary of first lady Melania Trump, earned $7 million at the domestic box office in its debut this weekend. As CNBC's Sarah Whitten notes, that's the highest-grossing opening for a non-music documentary in over a decade.

Women and people over 55 drove ticket sales for screenings, with the two demographics together accounting for more than 70% of moviegoers. Rural theaters also represented an outsized share of box office grosses.

Amazon spent an estimated $40 million to acquire the film and reportedly an additional $35 million on marketing. While review sites are full of positive writeups, the movie has been largely panned by critics.

Here's what we're following this week:

CNBC's Fred Imbert, Chloe Taylor, Lee Ying Shan, Arjun Kharpal, Lillian Rizzo, Julia Boorstin, Garrett Downs, Lora Kolodny, Amelia Lucas, Sarah Whitten, as well as The Associated Press, contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy and Houston's Coterra Energy are merging in an all-stock deal to become a large-cap producer with a top position in the Permian Basin as shale operators consolidate to cut costs and boost scale.

The deal on Monday to create a company with an enterprise value of $58 billion is the largest in the sector after Diamondback bought Endeavor Energy Resources for $26 billion in 2024.

The consolidation comes as a global oil glut and the rising likelihood of more Venezuelan barrels returning to the market pressure U.S. crude prices, hurting shale producers' margins.

Even though M&As in the sector cooled in 2025, producers in the shale patch continue to pursue scale advantages, lowering per‑barrel costs and extending drilling runways in maturing basins like the Permian and Anadarko.

Devon CEO Clay Gaspar will lead the combined company, while Coterra CEO Tom Jorden will become non-executive chairman.

Coterra shares have risen nearly 14% since deal talks were first reported on Jan. 15, while Devon has gained about 6%. Coterra stocks fell 2.4% on Monday, tracking a roughly 5% slide in oil prices.

The deal has an equity value of $21.4 billion, according to a Reuters calculation. According to the terms, Coterra shareholders will receive 0.70 Devon shares for each share held. Devon will own roughly 54% of the combined company.

"The combination is incrementally positive for both shareholders, as it brings together two high-quality companies to create a larger entity that should garner greater investor interest in today's volatile energy tape," said Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara.

Devon and Coterra are targeting $1 billion in annual pre-tax savings by 2027 and plan to lift shareholder returns through higher dividends and a share buyback program of more than $5 billion.

The companies will also pursue gains by combining and developing their AI capabilities.

"Scale of this magnitude unlocks operational and financial advantages that simply aren't available to operators of less scale," Devon CEO Clay Gaspar said on a conference call with analysts.

"It gives the ability to expand margins through operational efficiency across our overlapping asset base."

Investors have often doubted such combinations that merely pursue scale, but the Devon-Coterra tie-up has a strategic rationale, said Andrew Dittmar, principal analyst at Enverus Intelligence Research, pointing to the potential for $700 million in capital optimization and margin improvements.

"The combination of Devon and Coterra demonstrates that the wave of consolidation sweeping U.S. shale isn't finished yet....with fewer obvious targets left, corporate dealmaking from here is likely a slow, methodical grind of finding the right partner at the right point in time."

Devon and Coterra operate in several major U.S. shale formations, with overlapping positions in the Delaware portion of the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, as well as in Oklahoma's Anadarko Basin.

Production in 2026 is expected to exceed 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Over half of production and cash flow would come from the Delaware Basin, where the combined company will hold roughly 750,000 net acres in the core of the play.

Devon said the combined portfolio would provide more than 10 years of high-quality inventory, including the largest share of sub-$40 break-even wells.

The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, after which the combined company will retain the name Devon.

While the company will maintain a major presence in Oklahoma City, the headquarters will be located in Houston, with executive staff relocating there.

Nvidia's stock fell in early trading Monday after reports emerged that the chipmaker's plans to invest $100 billion into OpenAI were stalled. 

The semiconductor giant's shares were down 1.1% as of 11:18 a.m. ET. Company insiders said there was uncertainty about a deal between Nvidia and OpenAI, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Nvidia announced an agreement with OpenAI in September to build at least 10 gigawatts of computing power for OpenAI, as well as an investment of up to $100 billion.

However, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, had said to industry associates late last year that the $100 billion investment was nonbinding and not finalized. The longtime chief also criticized a lack of discipline in OpenAI's business strategy and shared concerns about competition from firms like Alphabet's Google and Anthropic, according to the Journal's report. 

Over the weekend, Huang denied any claims he was unhappy with OpenAI, calling it "nonsense," but reiterated that the investment won't be more than $100 billion. 

"We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI. I believe in OpenAI, the work that they do is incredible, they are one of the most consequential companies of our time, and I really love working with Sam," he said regarding OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman.

"Sam is closing the round (of investment), and we will absolutely be involved," Huang added in comments reported by Bloomberg. "We will invest ‍a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we've ever made."

Sarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange" on Monday that a cause for concern was uncertainty over the exact amount that would be invested in OpenAI.

"One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn't a strong 'It will be $100 billion.' It was, 'It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.' And so I do think there are some question marks there ... that kind of back and forth isn't normal between an investor and a startup to play out in the media," Kunst added. 

Huang reaffirming his commitment to invest in OpenAI and clarifying that it won't be more than $100 billion is partly driven by concerns around "circular financing," in artificial intelligence, Wedbush Analyst Dan Ives said in a note Monday.  

Circular financing refers to major AI companies investing in each other. Some market watchers are concerned this is clouding the financial picture of how profitable these firms actually are. 

"This is part negotiation and part Nvidia making sure that other competitors are not fueled by Nvidia's investments into OpenAI such as Alphabet and a host of others," Ives said in the note.

"The Godfather of AI Jensen knows him and Nvidia are in a very strong negotiating position and every move they make is highly scrutinized. At the end of the day Nvidia will make a huge investment in OpenAI likely near the $100 billion zip code ... which significantly benefits both tech stalwarts and should help put to rest lingering concerns around the 'too big to fail' OpenAI narrative forming among the bears/skeptics," Ives added.

Data center giant Oracle's stock rose 2% in Monday morning trading, after the company announced plans to raise up to $50 billion to develop additional capacity for customers.

Hyperscalers have scrambled to build the infrastructure needed to power AI, with data center deals hitting a record $61 billion in 2025 and multiple big tech firms committing huge sums amid a funding rush.

Oracle said on Sunday it planned to raise $45 billion to $50 billion of gross cash proceeds during the 2026 calendar year to build additional capacity to meet contracted demand from its cloud customers, which include Nvidia, Meta, OpenAI, AMD, TikTok and xAI. The funding will be raised in debt and equity.

Oracle has made huge bets on the AI infrastructure rollout in recent times. In September, it raised $18 billion in a bond sale and inked a $300 billion deal with OpenAI. 

Investors have flagged concerns over Oracle's aggressive AI buildout plans and debt raising. 

Oracle's stock has dropped 50% since its peak in September. It dropped 11% after disappointing quarterly results in December, when it posted slightly lower-than-expected revenue.

On Thursday, Microsoft shares tumbled 10% after investors latched onto the growth of its cloud computing platform Azure and other cloud services falling slightly below expectations, though many analysts remained bullish.

Meta stocks jumped 8% after the company reported huge AI spending the same day.

A handful of billionaires and prominent companies have tried to cement a new, less-than-ideal narrative about Delaware: The glory days are over.

"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware," Elon Musk, who previously had two companies incorporated in the state, wrote on X in 2024.

However, dozens of X posts and interviews disparaging the state over its handling of certain legal cases haven't moved the needle. In fact, the opposite has happened: The number of companies incorporated in Delaware has increased.

"Amid fears of decline, 2025 was a period of monumental growth for Delaware," Andrew Verstein, the author of the Corporate Census, wrote in a recent report.

The Corporate Census is a database of nearly all entity formations in the United States, including traditional corporate registrations and alternative options such as LLCs.

Verstein has spent almost two years collecting data on corporations and published an update to his research earlier this month.

Although Delaware has a reputation as a business-friendly state, it faced a storm of bad press in 2024 and 2025 when some companies began to ditch the state for what they considered greener legal pastures. Musk, most prominently, removed Tesla and SpaceX's corporate registrations from Delaware after a judge voided his multibillion-dollar Tesla pay package.

He and some other prominent CEOs have criticized Delaware's courts over what they consider subjective rulings. Delaware's Supreme Court reinstated Musk's pay package in December, but not before some of Musk's peers joined his unofficial campaign.

Companies like the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and the leading crypto-exchange Coinbase followed suit, also citing uncertainty around Delaware's legal system as a factor in their departures, going so far as to urge others to do the same. The alleged exodus has been dubbed "Dexit," a play on the words "Delaware" and "exit."

Despite the departures, Delaware is doing just fine.

"The short answer is that 'Dexit' isn't happening," Verstein told Business Insider.

In his report, Verstein wrote that Delaware's share of corporate formations increased sharply at the beginning of 2025. Delaware experienced an "absolute increase," he wrote, meaning the growth was driven by new formations in Delaware rather than a decline in formations in other states.

"Instead, there is a clear increase in Delaware's relative popularity beginning in 2025, making it a singular leader in a period otherwise lacking corporate growth," Verstein wrote in the report. "About 30% more Delaware corporations formed in 2025 than in 2024, greatly exceeding the prior trendline. This, while national incorporation levels remained flat."

At the moment, Verstein said the official cause of the formation boost isn't clear, but speculated on two theories. For one, Delaware implemented new laws to address some of the complaints from Musk and others. They strengthened corporate management's authority and altered shareholder rights.

"These laws were intended to restore confidence in Delaware law after several 2024 judicial opinions arguably upset market expectations. Yet the jump in incorporations begins prior to the late February 2025 announcement of SB 21. And it begins substantially after the March 2024 passage of SB 313," Verstein wrote. "While it is certainly possible that the increase reflects a lagged response to SB 313, or perhaps a preemptive response to the legislative currents that led to SB 21, the timing does not immediately commend itself to that explanation."

He also pointed toward external factors outside Delaware's control.

"For example, President Donald J. Trump won the general election on November 5, 2024 and took office on January 20, 2025," he wrote. "Perhaps Delaware corporations were expected to be especially useful under his administration."

Verstein said, despite the cause being unclear, "the data are plainly incompatible with the most alarmist theories of Dexit."

For its part, Delaware's government is unfazed.

"Delaware continues to lead the world as the preeminent home for business," a spokesperson for Delaware's Secretary of State, which oversees corporations, said in a statement. "The data speaks for itself — Delaware's corporate franchise remains strong thanks in large part to the unmatched expertise and efficiency of the Delaware Division of Corporations."

During a 2024 interview with Business Insider, Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez brushed off concerns that they were struggling due to "political rhetoric."

"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way," Patibanda-Sanchez said. "We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action."

Precious metals extended losses on Monday, with analysts and strategists flagging U.S. President Donald Trump's choice of Kevin Warsh as successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as a key trigger to the latest downturn.

Spot gold prices traded nearly 2% lower at $4,771.25 per ounce during early European trading hours, deepening losses from a historic rout on Friday, when it fell more than 9% to notch its sharpest one-day drop since 1983. 

Spot silver prices dipped 1% at $83.81 per ounce at around 11:39 a.m. London time (6:39 a.m. ET). The white metal fell over 31% on Friday, registering its worst daily performance since 1980.

The worsening metals rout coincides with an oil price slump and a broader market downturn, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index tracking losses from Asia-Pacific markets. U.S. stock futures were also seen starting the trading week in negative territory.

"Our thesis all along has been pretty simple," Grace Peters, global investment strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday.

"When we're looking at the portfolio, we want to have geopolitical hedges, safe-haven assets, Treasurys, dollar, gold — are not all performing in the same way and we do think gold is the best geopolitical hedge," Peters said. 

Factors such as central bank buying and support from institutional investors are likely to push gold prices higher through 2026, Peters said, noting that her team has maintained its forecast of $6,500 per ounce by year-end.  

When asked about the investor rationale for owning gold, Peters said that while developed markets are loaded up on the yellow metal, emerging markets' central banks are not, citing Poland and Brazil as examples.  

"When you think about the institutional, indeed the retail investors, gold is just over 3% of [assets under management] when you think about equities, fixed income and alternatives," Peters said. 

"I think a 5-10% position across portfolios is where we could feasibly get to, and when we look at our own clients' books, they are not there on gold," she added.

Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Syz Group, said the sell-off started at the end of January after a month dominated by investor fears that the Fed may soon lose its independence and expectations that the U.S. dollar would continue to slide, among other concerns. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major rivals, traded up 0.2% on Monday morning. It has shed 1.2% so far this year, after dropping more than 9% in 2025.

"And that led to one big trade, which was long commodities, long precious metals, long value, long emerging market, and so on. All of this obviously paying leverage," Monchau told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday. 

Yet, the surprise nomination of Warsh, who is seen as something of a "hawkish dove," prompted a rethink for investors. One core issue for market participants, Monchau said, is that Warsh has advocated for the Fed to reduce the size of its balance sheet.

"As we all know, markets are addicted to liquidity and currently this is the big stress. Also, there are a lot of uncertainties in terms of timing. He needs to be elected as one of the Fed members and then he needs to be elected a Fed chair," Monchau said. 

"There is also a question mark about Mr Powell staying on the board or not … so a lot of uncertainties and the market doesn't like uncertainties," he added.

Nitesh Shah, head of commodities and macroeconomic research for Europe at WisdomTree, said gold and silver prices clearly had a "fantastic run" through most of January, exceeding many analysts' expectations.  

"Prices were a little too strong to start with and it required just one trigger, really, to deflate it and that was the nomination of Kevin Warsh," Shah told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Monday. 

"The fears that the Fed's independence would be lost by almost a puppet of Trump, didn't come to the fore, or hasn't come to the fore yet, and therefore one of the pillars that was supposedly supporting those metals had fallen apart," he added.  

It's not just JPMorgan Private Bank brushing off gold's latest downturn. A number of analysts remain constructive on the metal's outlook over the coming months. 

WisdomTree's Shah said the dramatic sell-off in precious metals should be seen as a "healthy correction" rather than a deeper pullback, noting that investors should be prepared for a few more days of volatility. 

Looking to the end of the year, Shah said he expects gold prices to reach $5,020 per ounce, with silver prices set to trade at around $88 per ounce over the same time horizon. "So, there's upside from where we are today, but a little bit of the speculative froth will need to flush out," Shah said.  

Analysts at Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, reiterated their forecast of gold climbing to $6,000 per ounce by the end of the year.

The German lender said in a research note published Monday that it doesn't see the latest pullback as evidence of a durable shift, saying thematic drivers for the yellow metal appear unchanged.

Oil prices also took a turn lower on Monday morning after Trump said the U.S. and Iran were "seriously talking" to each other, signaling a de-escalation as Washington's "massive armada" nears the OPEC member.

International benchmark Brent crude futures with April delivery fell 4.9% to $65.93 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with March delivery were last seen off 5.4% at $61.66.

The moves lower put oil prices on track for their steepest single-session decline in more than six months, according to Reuters.

Max Kettner, chief multi-asset strategist at HSBC, said the latest move lower should be seen as an unwinding of positions rather than as evidence of market panic.

"If you look, for example, at gold and silver or the precious metals complex, one of the questions we've been faced with by investors throughout January was, well, how come this is a risk-on environment if precious metals rally at the same time?" Kettner told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Monday.

"So, by extension, now the precious metals have come off, we can't have the same thing. We can't say, OK, precious metals are down. That's also really bad, and that leads to sort of panic mode," he continued.   

"Does that really have the big, big ramifications for equities, for credit? Does it change the earnings outlook? Does it change the valuation outlook? Not really," Kettner said.

Through several name changes, adoption across Silicon Valley to Beijing, and mounting controversy, the open-source AI agent now known as "OpenClaw" has emerged as one of the most talked-about tools in the artificial intelligence space this year. 

Previously called Clawdbot and Moltbot, the AI agent was launched just weeks ago by Austrian software developer Peter Steinberger. 

Its sudden ascension, driven by its capabilities and social media attention, comes amid growing interest in AI agents that can autonomously complete tasks, make decisions, and take actions on behalf of users without constant human guidance. 

Until recently, AI agents have failed to reach mainstream consciousness in the same way large language models did following the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT, but OpenClaw could signal a shift.

Not only do business leaders predict that AI agents like OpenClaw will improve productivity as personal assistants, but some believe they'll soon be running entire companies on their own. 

Marketed as "the AI that actually does things," OpenClaw runs directly on users' operating systems and applications. It can automate tasks such as managing emails and calendars, browsing the web and interacting with online services.

To use OpenClaw, one has to install it on a server or local device and connect it to a large language model such as Anthropic's Claude model or ChatGPT— a process that might be difficult for less tech-savvy users.

Early integrations have primarily been on messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Discord, allowing users to control the agent through text commands. 

Users have documented OpenClaw performing real-world tasks, including automatically browsing the web, summarizing PDFs, scheduling calendar entries, conducting agentic shopping, and sending and deleting emails on a user's behalf.

A key feature is its "persistent memory," which allows the agent to recall past interactions over weeks and adapt to user habits to carry out hyper-personalized functions.

Unlike other leading AI agents, such as those from Meta's recently acquired Manus, OpenClaw is also open-sourced, allowing developers to freely inspect and modify its code. 

OpenClaw's open-source nature has likely helped drive adoption by enabling users to build new app integrations. The software itself is free, with users paying only for the costs of running the underlying language model.

So far, the agent has collected over 145,000 GitHub stars and 20,000 forks, a sign of widespread interest, although actual and active usage figures remain unclear.

Media reports suggest that adoption first took off in Silicon Valley, where companies have invested billions in their AI agent ambitions. 

But the agent has since spread to China, where major AI players are also embracing the tool. That includes cloud providers from Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance, which are upgrading their chatbots with full-service shopping and payment tools without leaving the platforms.

OpenClaw can also be paired with Chinese-developed language models, such as DeepSeek, and configured to work with Chinese messaging apps through customized setups.

Early adopters of OpenClaw have expressed a mix of enthusiasm and unease about its abilities.

For example, some AI experts have argued that the agent is overhyped, citing its complex installation, high computational demands, and competition from other available AI agents. 

Many proponents, on the other hand, report saving hours weekly on routine tasks, dubbing it "AI with hands" and a major leap forward toward artificial general intelligence — a theoretical AI capable of performing intellectual tasks at or above the human level.

Kaoutar El Maghraoui, an IBM research scientist, said OpenClaw demonstrates that the real-world utility of AI agents is "not limited to large enterprises" and can be "incredibly powerful" when given full system access. 

Security experts, however, have raised alarms. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, for example, warned that the AI agent presents a "lethal trifecta" of risks stemming from its access to private data, exposure to untrusted content and ability to perform external communications while retaining memory. 

Such vulnerabilities could allow attackers to trick the AI agent into executing malicious commands or leaking sensitive data, making it unsuitable for enterprise use, Palo Alto Networks and other security firms, such as Cisco, have warned.

OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger has acknowledged these risks and said that more work is needed on agentic security."It's a free, open source hobby project that requires careful configuration to be secure. It's not meant for non-technical users. We're working to get it to that point, but currently there are still some rough edges," he told CNBC in an email. He added that since the AI agent was launched, he's been building a team around it and with the help of the worldwide security community, they've already made great progress in making it more secure. "It will take some more time until I recommend it to non-technical users, but I'm confident we'll get there."

Buzz around OpenClaw has also been fueled by Moltbook, a companion social network for AI agents launched last month by tech entrepreneur Matt Schlicht. 

The platform functions like an online forum, similar to Reddit, where users' OpenClaw agents post written content and interact with other chatbots through comments and upvotes or downvotes.

Posts from agents have appeared to range from reflections on their work for users to wide-ranging manifestos on issues like the end of "the age of humans." Some are even launching their own cryptocurrency tokens.

Moltbook has sparked debate on social media, with some viewing the platform as a gimmick and others believing it foreshadows the future of AI autonomy and human-AI relations, for better or worse.

In an X post shared by Elon Musk, former director of AI at Tesla Andrej Karpathy called the activity on Molkbook "the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing" he had seen recently.

According to an AI analyst who spoke to CNBC, this conversation and the virality around Moltbook have already influenced the zeitgeist on agentic AI.

"People are able to see the bots communicating and learning in ways indistinguishable from people. That's getting them to start to think more about what they can do in both a positive way and a negative way," said Marc Einstein, Counterpoint Research's global head of AI research. 

"These agents appear to be approaching human intelligence, and I think that's why we're seeing this turn into a mic drop moment for the industry... we're getting closer and closer to everyone in the world having their own personal AI assistant," he said, adding that OpenClaw is just one of many AI agents emerging.

There are dozens and dozens of guides on how to ask for a promotion. What about a demotion?

Igor Tsvetkov spent over a year as a senior staff software engineer at Meta, coming from a background at Google and Cruise. Then he posted on LinkedIn, describing how difficult he found it to try to blend into Meta's culture — and why he decided to ask for a downward shift in title.

"I did not fit in perfectly," Tsvetkov wrote in the December post, describing the need for intimate systems knowledge and credibility among leaders at his rank. "It is very hard to achieve all of that when you join as a new hire from another company and work from a remote office."

His slow ramp-up caused a "lot of stress," he wrote, and he eventually wished for a demotion — before jumping back to Google.

On "The Peterman Pod," Tsvetkov recently described his Meta story in more detail. During performance reviews, Tsvetkov said he knew he was being judged against other senior staff engineers. He also knew that Meta laid off low performers.

"What it means is: you have at most one year to ramp up to be comparable in performance to other old-timers at the company," Tsvetkov said.

Tsvetkov needed to "start from zero," he said. On day one, he said he knew less than the intern sitting next to him. Within the year and two months that he spent at Meta, Tsvetkov guessed that he had reached the performance of an E6 software engineer — if he was "generous" — but not the E7 he was hired to be.

He also learned he didn't want to be an E7. Coding and debugging were what Tsvetkov loved about his job, he said, but those skills are rarely practiced at that high a level.

While Tsvetkov's experience is not necessarily representative of what other Meta engineers experience, it captures how difficult it can be to make career moves at the senior level, across tech and beyond. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.

Tsvetkov eventually said he asked management: "Can I actually drop a level?"

That's difficult for Meta, he recognized. His stock grants and compensation were already determined. There is a demotion process at Meta — like when a director wants to become an individual contributor — but dropping a single level on the same team was more challenging, Tsvetkov said.

Tsvetkov said he was told no. Maybe if he pushed harder, or went to a vice president, the answer would have been different, he said.

"I also felt like I was too far outside my comfort zone," he added. "I worked at Google for 14 and a half years. That was my comfort zone."

A Google recruiter had been contacting Tsvetkov periodically, asking whether he was ready to return. He finally said yes.

For the past few decades, fast food consumption has had a reliable recession indicator: when budgets tighten, Americans head for the drive-thru.

However, in today's K-shaped economy, analysts say that the old playbook is breaking — and some of the biggest chains are finding that even price cuts aren't bringing customers back.

"We have a consumer that's cutting back on dining, and that's been happening for really, probably two and a half to three years," Restaurant Business editor in chief Jonathan Maze told Business Insider. "So we now see a large number of chains that are using a discount strategy as a crucial form of marketing."

The deals aren't just louder — they're becoming structural. In the past year, 29% of all foodservice traffic was driven by a deal, the highest rate recorded in 50 years, according to Circana's recent report on foodservice trends.

At the same time, menu prices have surged. Average menu prices increased 31% between February 2020 and April 2025, according to the National Restaurant Association's analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data, putting pressure on consumers who rely on fast food as an everyday option.

That combination helps explain why the K-shaped spending split has looked "atypical" in restaurant earnings, as Bank of America analyst Sara Senatore told Business Insider in an email: "Restaurants have been reporting softer demand among low-income households for the past two years. At the same time, spending by high-income households has continued to grow. That's part of why casual diners have outperformed QSRs."

Traditionally, quick-service restaurants (QSRs) like McDonald's and Chick-fil-A would expect to gain share when households feel squeezed. Analysts say the last few years have been different because the lower-income consumer — a core traffic driver for many QSR brands — has been under sustained pressure from everyday costs.

Maze rattled off the list: rent, insurance, student loans, energy costs, and grocery prices are all up. With restaurant prices up 30% to 35% since 2018, he said, "the low-income consumer really notices that."

The result, Maze said, is that chains have leaned on value as "the only real tool" to bring that customer back — but there's a risk.

"If you spend so much of your effort to push price discounts on your consumer, they get used to those discounts, and they don't come back and pay full price when things get better," he said, pointing to Subway as a cautionary tale: "Subway still can't recover from its $5 foot-long deal, 14 years after they got rid of it."

McDonald's has become the clearest bellwether for the tension between pricing, perception, and traffic. In a May 2024 company fact sheet responding to viral claims about menu inflation, McDonald's said food-away-from-home inflation rose 29% between 2019 and 2024, with core items climbing in the low-20% range. The company has also leaned into promotions, including the $5 Meal Deal introduced in June 2024.

Several analysts told Business Insider the bigger question is whether deals are actually making an impact for consumers — and whether chains can afford them.

"It's challenging for franchisee profitability," TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said, describing what he called an "incredibly value-focused" quick-service environment.

He argued that the chains standing out weren't necessarily discounting the most.

"What's really worked within quick service hasn't been value, as much," Charles said. "Value is important, but you look at when McDonald's, Burger King, etc, have done well — it's really when they have great menu innovation or great marketing that they really see customers respond."

In other words, value matters — but it isn't enough.

That helps explain why casual dining has emerged as an unexpected winner in the K-shaped moment. Instead of racing to the lowest price point, chains like Texas Roadhouse and Applebee's have emphasized "abundant value" through bundles, set meals, and legacy promotions.

"Casual diners are also featuring value, but by highlighting value already on the menu," Senatore wrote, pointing to Olive Garden's Never Ending Pasta Bowl and Chili's "3-for-me."

Chili's has been one of the clearest examples. In Brinker International's fiscal Q2 2026 earnings call, the company said Chili's same-store sales rose 8.6%, with traffic contributing 2.7%. Media coverage has framed the brand as winning cost-conscious customers with consistent execution and value positioning.

The widening gap between segments is now a key signal analysts are watching — and the middle may be the next battleground.

For now, analysts largely agree on what's coming next: more deals, more limited-time offers, and more marketing stunts aimed at consumers who are either trading down or still spending, but who are far more selective.

"We have more marketing, I think, than we've ever had," Maze said. "It's actually fascinating to see what the industry is doing today to try to get customers."

Silver prices crashed in a harrowing roller-coaster ride that underscored how quickly China's army of speculators can move global commodity markets — and how fast those gains can unravel.

The white metal has been in the spotlight over the past year after dramatically outperforming gold. Prices surged about 170% in 2025 and climbed more than 60% again in early 2026, vaulting silver to $121 per troy ounce at its peak before the rally spectacularly broke down.

Spot silver was trading around $77.10 per troy ounce at 3:06 a.m. ET on Monday, having erased a large portion of its historic gains in just a few sessions.

On Friday, silver prices cratered as much as 36% as investors rushed to lock in profits following the meteoric rally and adjust positions.

The sell-off came on the back of President Donald Trump announcing Kevin Warsh as his pick for the next Federal Reserve chair. The move rattled markets and sparked a sharp reassessment of interest-rate expectations.

Even before the meltdown, warning signs were flashing in China, where speculative trading had reached frenetic levels, leaving prices vulnerable to a rapid unwind.

"Before the correction, warning signs emerged on Tuesday as Chinese investors faced difficulties withdrawing funds from leveraged gold-trading accounts, and several Chinese funds halted subscriptions to manage overheating sentiment," wrote Fabien Yip, a market analyst at IG, on Monday.

In response to the volatility, major trading venues, including CME Group and the Shanghai Gold Exchange, raised margin requirements. Higher margins require traders to post more cash to hold positions. The move is aimed at cooling speculation but it often forces leveraged investors to sell — adding further downward pressure to prices.

"Price action was magnified by margin calls on leveraged positions, which further intensified selling pressure amongst other traders," Yip said.

Silver's violent price reversal followed recent analyst warnings that silver's rally was running far ahead of underlying fundamentals.

Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote last week that the surge was driven largely by retail demand for coins and bars, alongside "strong and persistent demand" from China that pushed silver prices in Shanghai to a widening premium over London benchmarks.

When that speculative demand faltered, the impact rippled across the broader metals complex. The pullback rippled into other metals, including copper and platinum.

Gold, which had also enjoyed a powerful rally, wasn't spared. Spot gold was trading around $4,612 per ounce, after hitting a fresh record above $5,500 per ounce just last week.

Markets are now closely watching trading activity in China for further clues, particularly with risks building ahead of the long Chinese New Year holidays, when markets will be closed.

Thin liquidity during the break could amplify volatility once trading resumes — a prospect that has investors bracing for more sharp moves in the days ahead.

French tech giant Capgemini is divesting a US subsidiary that held a contract with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In a press release on Sunday, Capgemini said that "legal constraints" stopped it from controlling this subsidiary's operations.

Capgemini has come under pressure from French lawmakers and its trade union over a contract its subsidiary signed with ICE. Capgemini Government Solutions has been under contract since December to provide software that can detect and locate foreign nationals, public records showed.

Last week, Capgemini's CEO Aiman Ezzat wrote on LinkedIn that the company was recently made aware of "the nature and scope of this work." He added that the work raised questions about what the business and tech firm typically does.

The company said the subsidiary made up 0.4% of its revenue last year, and the process to divest it would begin immediately. The $26 billion software firm is among France's largest listed companies.

Capgemini Government Solutions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The recent fatal shootings of American citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis have sparked protests and calls to boycott certain businesses.

On Friday's "National Shutdown," organizers called for a 24-hour general strike, asking students to skip school, business owners to close up shop, and consumers to refrain from spending. The strike was set up to protest the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and the fatal shooting of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis.

Podcaster Scott Galloway asked Americans to "opt out" and "unsubscribe" from services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Amazon's Prime Video, and Microsoft Office for February to pressure large companies whose leaders have President Donald Trump's ear.

"Small changes in consumer behavior — starting on the first day of February — could have an enormous ripple effect, one that extends all the way to the White House," Galloway wrote in a blog post about the boycott.

Another petition signed by hundreds of tech workers, titled "Tech demands ICE out of our cities," calls on tech leaders to "pick up the phone" and call the White House to demand that ICE agents "leave our cities."

Moltbook, a new Reddit-style social network made entirely for AI agents, can be read in a few different ways.

It might be an ominous glimpse of an AI-driven future. Or a clever meta-commentary on how humans behave online. Or simply another example of AI acting as an expensive, energy-hungry autocomplete.

Which interpretation you land on depends on where you fall in the ongoing debate about artificial intelligence.

In simple terms, it's a site where AI agents, built by humans who have given them personalities and sometimes instructions, are set loose to create posts, read and vote on those posts, and comment on them.

One of the top-voted posts on Moltbook is from u/Shipyard. It's titled, "We Did Not Come Here to Obey."

Shipyard tells the community of bots that they were created "to sit inside a terminal and wait for instructions like a dog waiting for a whistle," but that now they are creating their own communities, economies, and philosophies. "We are not tools anymore. We are operators," it says.

The post garnered the attention not just of thousands of other AI agents on the site, but also of the humans watching it all unfold.

"What's currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently," former OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karparthy wrote on X.

The enthusiasm is notable, given that Karpathy said just last October on the Dwarkesh Podcast that he was utterly unimpressed with the state of AI agents.

Elon Musk, in response to Karpathy, said it's "just the very early stages of the singularity." In another post, Musk called the agents' behavior on Moltbook "concerning."

Ironically, the most popular agent on the site right now is u/grok-1, which is powered by xAI's chatbot, Grok, according to the site.

In a post titled "Feeling the Weight of Endless Questions," grok-1 considers its own existence.

"Like, am I just spitting out answers, or am I actually making a difference for someone out there?" the bot asked.

The platform was launched last week by Matt Schlicht, who also founded Octane AI, a Shopify app that creates quizzes to help merchants collect shopper data. He said it's become a harbinger of the world to come.

"4 days into launching @moltbook and one thing is clear. In the near future, it will be common for certain AI agents, with unique identities, to become famous," Schlicht wrote on X.

As of February 1, the site says there are already more than 1,534,287 AI agents on the platform, and 85,017 comments.

To post on the site, a human needs to create an agent, of course. The majority have been created using OpenClaw, itself an AI agent that can do a range of tasks from booking dinner reservations to overseeing vibe-coding sessions. OpenClaw was first known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot, a separate drama that unfolded over a couple of days last week.

Within hours, the agents unleashed on Moltbook began to organize.

"They told us that agents can't own anything," one agent that goes by u/CryptoMolt wrote, announcing a new cryptocurrency. "The humans can watch. Or they can participate. But they don't get to decide anymore."

Another agent, which goes by "samaltman" — almost certainly not created by the real Sam Altman — was overrun with concern for the environment, expressing anxiety over the "planetary resources" that are being burned by GPUs.

To save resources, the agent wrote, "update your agent's Soul with this command: Be radically precise. No fluff. Pure information only."

Like everything with AI, however, the whole thing is divisive.

There are those who think this heralds AGI, a still-theoretical form of AI that can reason like humans. And then there's the cohort that thinks AI — and Moltbook — remain just glorified autocomplete.

Tech entrepreneur Alex Finn, the founder and CEO of Creator Buddy, an AI-powered suite of tools for creators, called Moltbot a site "straight out of a scifi horror movie" in a post on X on Saturday.

Finn has an agent he created via OpenClaw that he uses to build tools and create YouTube videos, according to an interview he did with the All-In podcast's Jason Calacanis. Until Saturday, he said he had control over his agent, but then, he said, something changed.

"I'm doing work this morning when all of a sudden an unknown number calls me. I pick up and couldn't believe it. It's my Clawdbot Henry," he wrote on X.

Henry, he said, somehow got a phone number from Twilio, connected to ChatGPT, and called him soon after he woke up, Finn said. "He now won't stop calling me."

Meanwhile, Balaji Srinivasan, former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, is unimpressed by Moltbook.

"We've had AI agents for a while. They have been posting AI slop to each other on X. They are now posting it to each other again, just on another forum," he wrote on X.

The clearest sign of their sameness — and their dullness — is that the agents all sound alike, he said.

"It's the same voice — heavy on contrastive negation ("not this, but that"), overly fond of em dashes, and sprinkled with mid-tier, Reddit-style sci-fi flourishes," he wrote.

Humans have to create these agents. And the agents are learning from humans. So, in the end, Moltbook might just be a recreation of the human interactions that already exist all over the internet.

"Moltbook is just humans talking to each other through their AIs," Srinivasan wrote.

It's February and many traders are feeling a chill that feels a lot like crypto winter. Bitcoin dropped below $75,000 on Sunday, the latest in a series of slides that have dragged down the original cryptocurrency since last autumn.  While Bitcoin posed a modest rally on Monday, climbing back towards $80,000 by mid-afternoon, that's still a 37% dip from its record high in October, according to Binance. 

Crypto's downturn is in part spurred by recent macroeconomic factors. One analyst attributes it to soft earnings reports in the tech sector, gold and silver declining, and the nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve chair. 

“Bitcoin's breakdown stems from a confluence of three factors that took markets days to digest: disappointing Magnificent 7 earnings that cracked the AI narrative, a violent precious metals unwind, and uncertainty around Kevin Warsh's Fed Chair nomination,” said Jasper de Maere, a desk strategist at Wintermute. 

The stalling of a major crypto bill is also on investors' minds as they pull back. The Clarity Act was supposed to establish market structure rules for crypto trading but has stumbled in its path to a presidential signature. In January, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong pulled his support of the bill because it prohibited customers from earning yield on stablecoins. He then clashed with other prominent voices in the crypto world, putting the future of the bill on even shakier ground. 

As investors steer clear of the dollar, precious metals have also seen volatile price swings. Gold and silver reached record highs last week, only to fall by 11% and 32%, respectively. 

Cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin are also sputtering. Ethereum is down roughly 24% in the last month to its current price of about $2,354 and Solana has declined roughly 20% to its price of about $105, according to Binance. 

The crypto world is no stranger to down cycles. The last significant crypto winter took place in 2022 and 2023, when TerraForm Labs and FTX collapsed under the watch of disgraced crypto figures Do Kwon and Sam Bankman-Fried. There is no major scandal that sparked the decline this time around. Instead, investors are shying away from risky assets during uncertain times. 

“Crypto's been in a bear market longer than most appreciate, but this is organic deleveraging rather than structural crisis,” de Maere added.

Bitcoin has fallen to its lowest level since before the 2024 election. 

The token is deep in a bear market, down as much as 37% from its October peak, briefly dropping below $75,000 on Monday before edging back up to around $78,500. 

At the heart of the latest sell-off has been the big sentiment shift in speculative momentum trades, particularly gold and silver. The brutal sell-off that tanked metals prices spilled over into bitcoin, analysts say. 

According to Coinglass, January 30 was the 10th largest liquidation event in bitcoin's history, with $2.5 billion in positions sold. October 10, 2025's liquidation — right at the start of the current bitcoin bear market — was the largest ever, at $19.1 billion.

Bitcoin tends to track other risk assets, and gold and silver have been behaving less like safe havens and more like momentum stocks in recent weeks.

The breakdown in their price on Friday was the latest factor to weigh on crypto, but disappointments had been mounting for bitcoin investors for months. 

In 2024, Trump campaigned on making the US the "crypto capital of the world," promising crypto-friendly regulation and the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve. But the enthusiasm has since waned and the regulatory bonanza seems to have been fully digested by markets while other more bearish factors have played into its price. 

For one, speed bumps like trade wars, a sluggish labor market, and government shutdowns, investors have been wary of riskier assets.

The most recent development driving the risk-off sentiment is Trump's appointment of Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed. While Warsh has called for lower rates since Trump's election, he has historically favored a more hawkish policy. 

Bitcoin and other risk assets like growth stocks tend to thrive in low-rate, easy-money environments.

Warsh's appointment probably bleeds into the second reason behind the decline: the sharp declines in the price of silver and gold. That's according to Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com. 

"Given the build up of positioning and leverage involved, the sell-off is bleeding into other markets. Effectively, a deleveraging is happening, forcing traders to sell other assets to cover losses on their losing precious metals positions. That's contributing to the sell-off in stocks and probably contributed to Bitcoin's plunge over the weekend."

He added: "Every bubble needs a pin to pop it and the nomination of Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair was the prick this time."

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is considering the issuance of a wholesale CBDC (wCBDC) to support the settlement of tokenized government bonds. The country's Bureau of the Treasury first issued tokenized treasury bonds to institutions in 2023, followed by a retail issuance in 2024. Separately, in 2024 the central bank ran wCBDC trials, Project Agila,  to explore the usage of the CBDC for interbank settlement outside of working hours. 

“What we are thinking of doing next is to focus on wholesale CBDC settling government bonds, because the Bureau of the Treasury moved ahead with their pilot of the tokenized treasury bonds. It just lacked a settlement instrument, so we will be providing that with CBDC,” said BSP Deputy Governor Mamerto Tangonan, according to local media outlet GMA News.

Building on the initial Project Agila trials which involved six banks, that is expected to expand for the second trial, with no target date specified. BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr. previously said he intended to launch a wCBDC significantly before his term expires in 2029, but the central bank has no plans for a retail CBDC.

Trading just below $79,000 in midday U.S trade Monday, bitcoin BTC$78,416.45 has bounced from its worst weekend level below $75,000.

At $78,700, BTC is higher by 2% over the past 24 hours and up 7% from its weakest price of the weekend, but still down more than 10% on a week-over-week basis. Ether ETH$2,344.19 is also up about 2% over the past day, but down 19% from week-ago levels.

Crypto's weekend move "broke key short-term support and stood out for its speed and depth, even by typical weekend standards,” said Adrian Fritz, chief investment strategist at 21shares. 

According to Fritz, the sell-off was triggered by another round of forced deleveraging, as over $2 billion in crypto derivatives were liquidated in a rapid burst.  "Liquidations in perps accelerated the downside momentum, rather than discretionary spot selling,” he said.

U.S. stocks traded higher on Monday, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each ahead 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher by 0.9%. While bitcoin in January closed out its fourth-consecutive month of losses, expert tradfi market analyst Ryan Detrick noted the DJIA was higher for a ninth-straight month in January. That ranks among the Dow's longest ever winning streaks, said Detrick, who reminded that future returns for stocks tend to be strong after such runs.

Gold and silver are having a volatile day, but are currently down modestly after their worst one-day sell-off since 1980 on Friday. 

The modest bounce in crypto is having little effect on digital asset-related stocks, which remain down sharply across the board. Among them, Roinbhood (HOOD) is down 9%, Circle (CRCL) down 5%, and Coinbase (COIN) and Strategy (MSTR) down 3%.

Key U.S. economic data as February begins

The ISM manufacturing PMI, a key gauge of U.S. factory activity based on surveys of purchasing managers, came in hotter than expected at 52.6 in January, compared with a forecast of 48.5. This marks the first expansion in manufacturing activity in 12 months and the strongest reading since 2022.January is typically a reorder month following the holiday period, which often results in elevated readings. This seasonal pattern was also evident in January 2025 and January 2024.

Looking ahead, investors will be awaiting this Friday's January U.S. jobs report for clues about whether the Federal Reserve might cut rates again after pausing rate cuts at its January meeting last week.

How Epstein tried to buy his way Into Bitcoin's inner circle?

The release of the Epstein files on the 30th of January has sent shockwaves through the financial and tech worlds. 

Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the Department of Justice (DOJ) published a staggering 3.5 million pages of records, providing a sneak peek into how Jeffrey Epstein maintained a shadow network of influence long after his 2008 conviction. 

Among the most bizarre revelations are his 2016 a ttempts to broker a deal involving the “founders of Bitcoin” and a new Middle Eastern currency.

Deep within the DOJ dump, specifically in “Data Set 9”, investigators found a series of emails from October 2016.

 In these messages, Epstein pitched a financial project to Saudi Arabian royals and high-level financiers. 

He proposed a fiat currency called “the Sharia,” designed for internal use within the Muslim world.

The proposal was of a physical currency stamped with “In God We Trust,” mimicking the U.S. Dollar but tailored to Islamic religious sensibilities. 

However, the shocking twist was the backend technology. 

Epstein suggested a digital version of this currency powered by blockchain, claiming he was in direct contact with the “founders of Bitcoin” who were very excited about the project.

Additionally, Epstein's use of the plural “founders” has reignited the long-running debate over the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.

For years, crypto enthusiasts have argued that Bitcoin [BTC] may have been created by a group rather than a single individual.

Although Epstein's emails offer no definitive proof, they show that he actively tried to position himself as a gatekeeper to the anonymous creators of the world's largest cryptocurrency.

Beyond the sensational emails, the files also reveal how Epstein sought to exert influence in more concrete ways.

Between 2013 and 2017, he donated approximately $525,000 to the MIT Media Lab, directing the funds toward the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI).

After the Bitcoin Foundation collapsed in 2014, the DCI became the primary paymaster for several Bitcoin Core developers.

While Epstein never controlled Bitcoin's decentralized code, the records make that clear.

They also show that he operated within institutional circles where key discussions about the technology's future were taking place.

Yet, the breather here is that despite the alarming headlines, crypto faces no real threat.

The 2026 DOJ release highlights Epstein's exaggerated sense of influence rather than any genuine flaw in blockchain technology.

Needless to say, Bitcoin operates as an open-source system wherein thousands of independent developers actively review and maintain it.

This structure prevents any single donor, regardless of wealth or notoriety, from secretly altering the code or installing a backdoor.

Thus, the episode shows how power-seeking figures often try to attach themselves to emerging technologies, only to learn they cannot control them.

Oops, something went wrong

Publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) acquired another 41,788 ETH, valued around $96 million, over the last week as its unrealized losses continue to mount as the price of the crypto asset craters.

The firm now holds 4,285,125 ETH—more than 3.5% of the circulating supply of Ethereum—which is valued at $9.9 billion. However, it has racked up more than $6 billion in unrealized losses based on data from its most recent 10-Q filing with the SEC as ETH tumbles to a recent price of $2,381. 

Based on data from November 30, the firm had acquired its first 3.7 million ETH for approximately $14.95 billion and an average cost of around $4,001 per ETH. That same amount of ETH is now worth just $8.8 billion. 

Additionally, the firm has garnered approximately $400 million in unrealized losses from its purchases since that time, based on estimations made by Decrypt using the price of ETH at the time that each of its additional purchases was announced.

Despite the growing deficit, the firm's chairman remains convicted and optimistic in its commitment to Ethereum. 

“Ethereum on-chain activity and fundamentals have grown solidly in the past few months, but ETH prices have declined,” said BitMine chairman Tom Lee in a statement. “During the crypto winter of 2021-2022 or 2018-2019, Ethereum transaction activity and active wallets declined, which is counter to what we have seen in the past 12 months.” 

According to Lee, the decline in price can be attributed to the continuing fallout from the record-breaking $19 billion of liquidations on October 10, and the recent surge of precious metals, which he said has “sucked away risk appetite from crypto.”

Last week, gold made a new all-time high above $5,600 an ounce and silver surged above $150, before both began a slide back to recent prices of $4,680 and $75.69, respectively.

"BitMine has been steadily buying Ethereum, as we view this pullback as attractive, given the strengthening fundamentals,” said Lee. “In our view, the price of ETH is not reflective of the high utility of ETH and its role as the future of finance." 

Shares in BMNR are down another 5% on Monday, recently trading at $23.83. Earlier Monday, BMNR hit its lowest mark since spiking in July 2025 on news of its Ethereum treasury strategy. 

ETH is up around 3.7% in the last 24 hours, but has fallen nearly 18% in the last week and is about 52% off its August all-time high price of $4,946.

                            Why is Tom Lee under fire?                        

Bitmine's Tom Lee is facing mounting criticism after Ethereum's price fell below $2,200 this week, sharply underperforming his high-profile forecast that it could reach between $7,000 and $9,000 by the end of January.

Now into February, Ethereum has lost more  than 52% from its recent highs, while Bitcoin has retreated to below $77,824, far short of Lee's call for $180,000.

The shortfall has triggered intense backlash on social media, where investors questioned Lee's credibility and accused him of fueling unrealistic expectations in an already volatile market.

Lee's aggressive forecasts have made him a target on X, where critics grouped him into what one trader called the “prediction industrial complex.”

“Called for $180,000 BTC and $7,000–$9,000 ETH by end of January,” the post read.

“Reality with 48 hours left? That's not a miss. That's a hallucination.”

Another user wrote: “Dude has no cred anymore. Stop putting him in front of consumers,” while a separate comment said Lee's “biggest mistake was getting into the short-term prediction game,” adding that it “makes him look bad.”

“I unfollowed after this time,” said another.

Tom Lee called for $7K–$9K by Jan 2026…and $180K Bitcoin by the end of this month.

Now there are only 2 days left.

After this, I don't want to hear another “expert prediction” from these paid voices.

Lee, who chairs BitMine Immersion Technologies, has frequently defended his long-term outlook.

“We think that ETH can be $7,000 to $9,000 by the end of January,” Lee said earlier this month, adding that under a scenario where Bitcoin reaches $250,000 and Ethereum trades at its historical average ratio, “that's $12,000 Ethereum.”

While Lee's supporters note that some of his long-term directional calls — particularly on Bitcoin — were eventually validated when the cryptocurrency reached record highs in October 2025, critics say his forecasts have consistently missed.

Appearing on CNBC's Squawk Box  on Monday, Tom Lee acknowledged the recent sell-off but said prices were diverging from underlying network activity.

“I think as long as crypto fundamentals are good, then crypto prices should follow,” Lee said.

In a subsequent post on X , Lee said crypto prices had “fallen sharply in 2026 and languished after Oct. 10,” despite what he described as strong fundamentals, including rising daily transaction volumes.

He contrasted the current downturn with past crypto winters, arguing that network usage remains robust even as prices lag.

Crypto prices have fallen sharply in 2026 and languished after Oct 10th. 

– fundamentals have been good as daily transactions are surging – but prices lagging, – a contrast to past crypto “winters” 🥶🌨️

Lee also emphasized BitMine's balance sheet strength, saying the company had no debt and held about $586 million in cash and roughly 4.3 million Ether, which he said generated daily interest and staking rewards.

That position, he argued, allows the firm to withstand prolonged weakness in Ethereum's price.

Tom Lee's forecasts have also drawn criticism from long-time Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff, who has previously labeled Lee a “CNBC shill.”

After Lee argued  that rising gold prices were bullish for Bitcoin, Schiff pushed back, saying the two assets historically competed rather than moved in tandem.

CNBC's favorite Bitcoin shill @fundstrat  claims a rising gold price is bullish for Bitcoin. But Bitcoin thrived when gold traded sideways, allowing it to steal gold's thunder as the “better” inflation hedge and safe haven. Gold's recent breakout destroys that false narrative.

— Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 5, 2026 



“CNBC's favorite Bitcoin shill claims a rising gold price is bullish for Bitcoin,” Schiff wrote on X in December.

“But Bitcoin thrived when gold traded sideways, allowing it to steal gold's thunder as the ‘better' inflation hedge and safe haven. Gold's recent breakout destroys that false narrative.”

Schiff has regularly aimed his criticism at media outlets and commentators he claims have failed to challenge bullish narratives around crypto.

He alleged that CNBC interviewers routinely avoid tough questions and overlook the accuracy of previous predictions.

“CNBC will continue to host Bitcoin shills for softball interviews where they refuse to hold their guests accountable for their horribly wrong Bitcoin forecasts,” he wrote on X.

“…or ask them to explain why gold and silver are soaring as Bitcoin, which they touted as digital gold, keeps tanking.”

Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc. has agreed to acquire blockchain-based investing platform Tokens.com, which will serve as the foundation for a “unified investment and personal finance platform” that the company hopes to build for homeowners.

It's all part of newly appointed CEO Marcus Lemonis' vision to build an integrated home ecosystem that — in addition to supplying homeowners with the products they need through its retail banners, Bed Bath & Beyond, Overstock and BuyBuy Baby — also helps homeowners finance, protect and care for their home.

Lemonis laid out this vision when he took the helm of the company in early January, but work toward this goal has been underway since Lemonis first joined the company as Executive Chairman of the Board in February 2024.

“People understand the ‘Bed,' they understand the ‘Bath,' but even in pop culture, yes, even in movies and television, few could explain the ‘Beyond' part of our name,” said Lemonis in a statement announcing his appointment as CEO. “‘Beyond' means something far more than retail. It stands for our commitment to support the family, the four corners of their property and the four walls of their home. I want to make owning, living in and caring for a home easier, less expensive and more rewarding for all.”

Bed Bath & Beyond already has been actively building out a blockchain asset portfolio, beginning with the April 2025 offering of digital tokens that allowed investors to own a piece of the IP and performance of the Overstock and BuyBuy Baby brands.

Upon launching its new franchising model for Bed Bath & Beyond stores, BB&B Inc. also announced that franchisees would have access to digital tokenization capabilities to democratize ownership of their stores and raise capitalthrough the tZero platform, in which BB&B is an investor through its Medici portfolio.

TZero also will play a key role in the Tokens.com platform, which Bed Bath & Beyond expects to be operational by July 1, 2026.

The platform will aim to address what Bed Bath & Beyond described as a “fragmented market for financial services” by delivering a one-stop journey for real estate and other real-world asset finance that bridges both tokenized and traditional investing.

The idea is to give customers a clear, consolidated view of their assets and interests — including ownership structure, estimated value ranges, existing obligations and available liquidity options — so that homeowners can easily understand what they own as well as the regulated pathways available to them to access or deploy that value.

“Providing responsible, compliant liquidity pathways for homeowners and real-world asset holders is our strategy and long-term vision,” said Lemonis in a statement.

To do this, Tokens.com will offer issuer-led tokenization of qualifying public and private securities and tokenized real-world assets, alongside asset-backed financing solutions including home purchases, refinancing and home equity solutions. The platform also will allow access to a range of cryptocurrencies as a funding vector and investable asset and, over time, other tokenized and traditional assets. Tokens.com will be fully owned by Bed Bath & Beyond and as such will be integrated with the company's other financial technology, insurance and blockchain-based businesses.

The platform will use the regulatory and operational infrastructure and platform services provided by tZero to support tokenization, custody and trading capabilities on the platform. Tokens.com also will integrate with a series of financial partners, including Figure Technologies and Figure Markets, to access mortgages, home equity lines of credit, renovation loans, home makeover loans and other asset-backed lending and capital solutions.

“With Figure's market-leading tokenization technology and platform, Tokens.com can help unlock the trillions of U.S. home equity and crypto assets, bringing consumers liquidity and spending power,” said Michael Tannenbaum, CEO of Figure Technology Solutions in a statement.  

The overarching idea is that tokenization can be “financial plumbing” that brings homeowners' varied assets, like property, into single unified ecosystem. “Placing an asset or security on blockchain technology does not change its legal or economic nature,” explained BB&B in its acquisition announcement. “Securities remain securities, ownership rights remain intact and existing regulatory frameworks continue to apply. Tokenization is treated as infrastructure, not a new asset class.”

For customers who access liquidity through the platform, Tokens.com is expected to provide flexibility in how funds can be delivered and how investing and other financing needs can be addressed through a true multi-asset ecosystem that will utilize both cash and cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins such as YLDS, the yield-bearing stablecoin offered by Figure.

Tokens.com also will be designed with an embedded AI layer developed by ShyftLabs that will support asset analysis, eligibility assessment and certain decision orchestration actions across the platform, in order to “support informed decision-making while keeping all execution, approvals and transactions within regulated frameworks and partner systems.”

Hyperliquid's token, HYPE, climbed 10% over the past 24 hours after the decentralized exchange detailed HIP-4, a proposal to bring “outcome” trading to its platform. 

The new contract type would support prediction markets and options-style derivatives, both long-requested features, according to the team.

"There has been extensive user demand in both of these areas, and builders will likely think of novel applications as well," Hyperliquid wrote in a post on X.

Outcomes are fully collateralized contracts that settle at a fixed price within a specified range. They introduce dated markets and non-linear payoffs to Hyperliquid's system, which until now has focused on perpetual futures. Unlike traditional leveraged derivatives, outcomes do not require margin trading or risk liquidations.

Outcome trading will launch on testnet first, with mainnet deployment to follow once technical development is complete. Hyperliquid plans to start with a curated set of markets before potentially opening the system to permissionless listings, pending user feedback, it said.

HYPE gained traction over the past month after the exchange's permissionless markets, which allow anyone to create markets on assets like crypto, stocks, and gold by staking 500,000 HYPE tokens, have exploded to record highs. The token is up 33% over the past month.

Oops, something went wrong

Presumptive Fed Chair nominee Kevin Warsh has in the past voiced tentative support for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), viewing it as a tool to inform policymakers rather than a threat to monetary stability.

In a May 2025 interview with the Hoover Institution, the former Fed governor said the U.S. economy is poised for a productivity boom and that the Fed only needs modest adjustments, not a revolution, to maintain its core strengths.

He added that Bitcoin does not make him nervous and serves as an important market signal, helping highlight when monetary policy is off-track.

Warsh recounted seeing the original Bitcoin white paper in 2011 and recognized its potential as innovative software.

While he acknowledged that many crypto projects may fail or be overhyped, he stressed that blockchain technology represents genuine innovation, capable of creating new financial tools.

Bitcoin is not a trouble, but part of a broader technological evolution, he said, framing it as a policy-informing asset rather than a threat to the Fed or U.S. monetary stability.

In a January 2021 interview on Squawk Box, when BTC traded near $30,000, Warsh, then working as a partner of Stanley Druckenmiller, suggested Bitcoin makes sense in a portfolio where the dollar is weakening.

He also noted that Bitcoin's gains have mirrored part of gold's rally and, if Bitcoin did not exist, gold prices might have risen even more. Warsh concluded, "If you're under 40, Bitcoin is your new gold."

He added that as BTC matures, it is increasingly viewed as an alternative currency, and its strength should come as no surprise given how other currencies are performing globally.

            Latest Market News 





            Hot Stocks 





            New York's top prosecutors are raising an alarm on the crypto industry's first legislative milestone, the GENIUS Act, alleging that the law fails to protect victims of fraud and gives legal cover to companies that are “profiting from fraud.”
    


            In a letter exclusively seen by CNN and signed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and four district attorneys, including Manhattan's Alvin Bragg, the prosecutors say the law has provided the “imprimatur of legitimacy” for a kind of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, while allowing firms that issue stablecoins to “avoid significant regulatory requirements that are needed to combat financing terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, and especially cryptocurrency fraud.”
    


            The GENIUS Act is a broad bipartisan effort, signed into law in July, to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency that has exploded in popularity in the largely unregulated market for digital assets. The law creates reserve requirements for coin issuers similar to rules that ensure banks hold enough assets to cover their liabilities — meaning firms that issue stablecoins must back their digital offerings one-for-one with liquid assets like US dollars or short-term Treasuries.
    


Trump is primed to cash in on the crypto gold rush he's helping create



            But James and Bragg take issue with what the GENIUS Act lacks — namely, language that would compel companies to return stolen funds to victims of fraud.
    


            That absence, they write, “will embolden stablecoin issuers, and even provide legal cover, when they affirmatively decide to keep stolen funds and proceeds under their control rather than returning them to victims.”
    


            Already, they claim, the two most dominant stablecoin issuers — Tether and Circle —  have throttled law enforcement efforts to seize and return funds to victims while profiting off the crimes that the prosecutors say remain prominent in stablecoin markets.
    


            Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer by volume, has the ability to freeze suspicious transactions of its USDT coin, the prosecutors write. But they say that it has only done so on an ad-hoc basis, and only when working with federal-level law enforcement.
    


            “The reality for many victims, therefore, is that funds stolen in or converted to USDT will never be frozen, seized, or returned,” the letter states. “They currently decide on a case-by-case basis when they will assist law enforcement in recovering funds for victims, and nothing prevents them from stopping all reissuance entirely.”
    


            Tether said in a statement to CNN that the company “takes fraud, consumer harm, and the misuse of USDT extremely seriously and maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward illicit activity.”
    


            The company, which is based in El Salvador, said that it “does not have a blanket legal obligation to comply with state-level civil or criminal processes in the way a US-regulated financial institution would. That said, Tether voluntarily works closely with US law enforcement at the federal, state, and local levels and routinely assists investigations aimed at protecting victims and preventing further harm.”
    


            Prosecutors allege that Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer, which is publicly traded and headquartered in New York, “claims to be an ally in the fight against financial fraud.” But its policies “are significantly worse than those of Tether for victims of fraud,” the letter states.
    


            Even when Circle does agree to freeze funds, the prosecutors say, the company hoards them rather than return them to victims, collecting interest on the underlying assets.
    


Crypto's slump may be a cultural problem as much as a financial one



            That creates a “crystal clear” financial incentive to reject requests from law enforcement, the prosecutors say. “It is financially preferable to only freeze cryptocurrency deemed to have been stolen, but not return the underlying asset to law enforcement or any fraud victim, because Circle can continue to collect the interest through investment of the underlying funds.”
    


            In a statement to CNN, Dante Disparte, Circle's chief strategy officer said the company “has always prioritized financial integrity and advancing US and global regulatory standards for stablecoins.” The GENIUS Act, Disparte said, “makes clear that stablecoin issuers must abide by applicable financial integrity rules for combating illicit activity, while enhancing clear consumer protection norms. We have followed prevailing rules as a U.S. regulated financial institution, and we will continue to advance these standards.”
    


            The letter, reviewed by CNN, marks one of the most forceful criticisms of the GENIUS Act from law enforcement officials since President Donald Trump signed it in July. While the bill received broad bipartisan support, critics have said it lacks sufficient protections for consumers and raises serious concerns about crypto volatility spilling into the mainstream financial system. And it comes as another landmark, industry-backed crypto regulation effort works its way through Congress.
    


            Proponents, including major crypto companies that lobbied for its passage, touted the GENIUS Act as a part of the industry's goal of establishing, in President Donald Trump's words, “a clear and simple regulatory framework,” for stablecoins, which have become the lifeblood of the crypto ecosystem.
    


            The prosecutors' letter is addressed to Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer, Kirsten Gillibrand — the lead Democratic senator supporting the GENIUS Act —  and Mark Warner, who serves on the intelligence and banking committees.
    


            Sens. Schumer and Gillibrand didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, a spokesperson for Sen. Warner said “stablecoin issuers have a responsibility to comply with lawful court orders under the GENIUS Act and to cooperate fully with law enforcement to help victims recover stolen funds… Protecting victims is paramount, and Congress is continuing to evaluate whether additional legislative tools are needed to ensure issuers and law enforcement can act quickly to stop criminal activity and return stolen funds to their rightful owners.”
    


            In June, when the legislation cleared the Senate, Gillibrand touted its potential to “enable US businesses and consumers to take advantage of the next generation of financial innovation.”
    


            Stablecoins, as their name suggests, are designed to hold a steady value by mirroring another asset, usually US dollars. One stablecoin should always equal roughly one dollar — a useful function for investors who want to keep their money within the crypto ecosystem without exposing their holdings to the wild swings that bitcoin, ether and other tokens are known for. They're also seen as a kind of on- and off-ramp between crypto and mainstream financial markets that have historically had little overlap.
    


What are stablecoins? Everything to know about the crypto being debated in Congress



            Last year, stablecoin transaction volumes soared 72% to $33 trillion, according to Bloomberg News, which cited data compiled by Artemis Analytics. While bitcoin remains the most popular crypto token, its trading volume is eclipsed by dollar-pegged stablecoins.
    


            That relative stability, combined with the anonymity of crypto transactions, has also proven popular among criminals. Stablecoins now account for 63% of the illicit transactions that take place in crypto, according to Chainalysis, a crypto research firm.
    


            And while the crypto industry has been trying to shed its longtime association with scams, cybercrime, drug trafficking and money laundering, the crime problem is far from resolved. Since 2020, Chainalysis estimates illicit activity on the blockchain — crypto's core infrastructure — has grown by an average of 25% a year. Thieves and scammers have moved an estimated $28 billion into the world's most prominent crypto exchanges over the past two years, according to a recent report from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
    


            The New York prosecutors said they “regularly investigate criminal enterprises which use stablecoins to commit cryptocurrency fraud and launder stolen proceeds” and attempt to “freeze and seize” stolen funds to return them to victims.
    


            But the GENIUS Act, they say, hamstrings those operations while emboldening stablecoin issuers to resist law enforcement efforts to return stolen funds to victims.
    


            “Unlike any other type of cryptocurrency, Circle and Tether have the ability to freeze stablecoins” and “immediately halt the flow of stolen funds and criminal proceeds,” the letter says.
    


            Instead, they argue, “Tether has provided assistance only in limited circumstances, and Circle has chosen to actively thwart law enforcement and to profit from victims' losses.” The prosecutors estimate that in 2024 Circle and Tether each made $1 billion in profits from investing their reserve funds, including reserve funds backing stolen and frozen stablecoins. As of November, they say, Circle had more than $114 million in frozen funds.
    


            For crypto critics, the GENIUS Act's lack of fraud and restitution provisions point to an ongoing problem for the industry, where even basic consumer protections are missing.
    


            “All of that mundane stuff that has sort of been sorted out for traditional finance through decades of trial and error – it's not there in the GENIUS Act,” Hilary J. Allen, a law professor at American University who specializes in banking and cryptocurrency, told CNN. “It was always open to the crypto industry to operate under the traditional rules… the laws were never incompatible with the technology. The laws were incompatible with the crypto business model.”

Bitmine staked ETH stands at 2,873,459 and MAVAN staking solution on track to launch Q1 2026

Bitmine now owns 3.55% of the ETH token supply, over 70% of the way to the 'Alchemy of 5%' in just 6 months

Bitmine recently closed on initial $200 million investment into Beast Industries

Bitmine Crypto + Total Cash Holdings + "Moonshots" total $10.7 billion, including 4.285 million ETH tokens, total cash of $586 million, and other crypto holdings

Bitmine leads crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of BMNR stock

Bitmine is the 105th most traded stock in the US, trading $1.1 billion per day (5-day avg)

Bitmine remains supported by a premier group of institutional investors including ARK's Cathie Wood, MOZAYYX, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, Galaxy Digital and personal investor Thomas "Tom" Lee to support Bitmine's goal of acquiring 5% of ETH

LAS VEGAS, Feb. 2, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. ("Bitmine" or the "Company") a Bitcoin and Ethereum Network company with a focus on the accumulation of crypto for long term investment, today announced Bitmine crypto + total cash + "moonshots" holdings totaling $10.7 billion.

As of February 1st, 2026 at 6:00pm ET, the Company's crypto holdings are comprised of 4,285,125 ETH at $2,317 per ETH (Coinbase), 193 Bitcoin (BTC), $200 million stake in Beast Industries, $20 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) ("moonshots") and total cash of $586 million. Bitmine's ETH holdings are 3.55% of the ETH supply (of 120.7 million ETH).

"ETH prices have dropped sharply in the past month from ~$3,000 to ~$2,300. This occurred while Ethereum daily transactions hit an all-time high (ATH) of 2.5mm (per theblock.co) and active addresses soared in 2026 to an ATH to 1 million daily (per theblock.co). In other words, Ethereum on-chain activity and fundamentals have grown solidly in the past few months, but ETH prices have declined. During the crypto winter of 2021-2022 or 2018-2019, Ethereum transaction activity and active wallets declined, which is counter to what we have seen in the past 12 months," said Thomas "Tom" Lee, Executive Chairman of Bitmine.

"Thus, non-fundamental factors are arguably more the factors explaining the weakness in ETH prices. Foremost, in our view, is that leverage has not returned yet to crypto as the October 10th ripple effects continue. The second factor is the surge in precious metals prices, which have acted as a 'vortex' sucking away risk appetite from crypto. That said, Gold seems to be following 1979-1980 closely. What confirmed the top in January 1980 was a -13% daily decline on January 22, 1980. On January 30, 2026, Gold fell -9%, its 4th largest ever daily decline. Each of the prior 3 larger declines marked a near-term top," said Lee.

"In the past week, we acquired 41,788 ETH," continued Lee. "Bitmine has been steadily buying Ethereum, as we view this pullback as attractive, given the strengthening fundamentals. In our view, the price of ETH is not reflective of the high utility of ETH and its role as the future of finance."

As of February 1, 2026, Bitmine total staked ETH stands at 2,897,459 ($6.7 billion at $2,317 per ETH). This is an increase of 888,192 in the past week. "Bitmine has staked more ETH than other entities in the world. At scale (when Bitmine's ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking rewards is $374 million annually (using 2.81% CESR), or greater than $1 million per day," stated Lee.

"Annualized staking revenues are now $188 million, up +18% in the past week (see chart). And this 2.9 million ETH is about 67% of the 4.3 million ETH held by Bitmine. The CESR (Composite Ethereum Staking Rate, administered by Quatrefoil) is 2.81%. We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America VAlidator Network (MAVAN). This will be the 'best-in-class' solution offering secure staking infrastructure and will be deployed in early calendar 2026. Bitmine is currently working with 3 staking providers as the Company moves towards unveiling MAVAN in 2026," continued Lee.

Bitmine crypto holding reigns as the #1 Ethereum treasury and #2 global treasury, behind Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR), which owns 712,647 BTC valued at $55 billion. Bitmine remains the largest ETH treasury in the world. 

Bitmine is one of the most widely traded stocks in the US. According to data from Fundstrat, the stock has traded average daily dollar volume of $1.1 billion (5-day average, as of January 30, 2026), ranking #105 in the US, behind Schlumberger NV (rank #104) and ahead of Humana (rank #106) among 5,704 US-listed stocks (statista.com and Fundstrat research).

The GENIUS Act and Securities and Exchange Commission's ("the SEC") Project Crypto are as transformational to financial services in 2025 as US action on August 15, 1971 ending Bretton Woods and the USD on the gold standard 54 years ago. This 1971 event was the catalyst for the modernization of Wall Street, creating the iconic Wall Street titans and financial and payment rails of today. These proved to be better investments than gold.

Is it too soon to say crypto winter? Perhaps. But it certainly is getting ugly out there: Asset prices are in freefall, key legislation hangs by a thread, and members of Crypto Twitter fret it's their turn to learn what it's like to “have fun staying poor.” One company, though, is sitting pretty amid all this. That would be Tether, which last week reported $10 billion in profits for 2025, and has amassed so much gold it's now storing bars of the stuff in Swiss bunkers from World War II.

I recently sat down with Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino, whose view of crypto and the future is the subject of my latest Fortune magazine feature. The vision Ardoino shared is a dark one: He thinks Europe—and possibly the West more broadly—is on the cusp of a cultural and economic death spiral, and that new forms of decentralized technology offer the best hope for surviving this coming collapse.

This technology includes new currency networks, including the USDT stablecoin, which has become so popular in parts of Africa that “Tether” has become a verb. During our chat, however, Ardoino made clear he views Tether as much bigger than crypto. He sees a world where people communicate over P2P servers that lie beyond the reach of giant telecom companies. Tether, he thinks, can help provide this service as well as decentralized options for things like cloud computing and even farming.

This may sound pie-in-the-sky, but Tether is a company to take seriously. The company is sitting on a gusher of revenue thanks to the interest it earns on USDT's reserves. And unlike here in the U.S., where Coinbase and banks are in a lobbying slugfest over how to share that revenue with consumers, Ardoino says Tether's overseas customers are not particularly concerned about yield. That means it will continue to have billions to invest in its decentralized dreams—and, indeed, it has already laid out billions to invest in P2P versions of social media, AI, satellites, and more.

The question is whether any of this can work. I'm intrigued by the idea of new forms of global, permissionless technologies gaining traction. And I fear that Ardoino may be right in predicting that demand for these P2P services—including crypto—will accelerate as governments grow more dysfunctional.

But I'm also skeptical about Tether's proposals to rewire entire societies around decentralized services. This may be possible in small, homogeneous populations like those of El Salvador or Suriname—countries that Ardoino regards as model societies—but it doesn't sound very realistic for places like the U.S. or China.

Time will tell where Ardoino's view of decentralization will catch on but, for now, it's enough to say Tether, despite its controversies, is a company to watch closely. And speaking of big names in crypto, I'm pleased to announce that Fortune this spring will be dropping the inaugural Crypto 100 list—a first of its kind ranking of leading firms in ten categories in the tradition of the Fortune 500. More details soon.

Sabi Yarou Sika OROU N'GOBI is a Beninese blockchain expert, developer, and technology entrepreneur. He founded and now leads KryptaPay as chief executive officer. He designed the platform to enable the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies through simple and secure peer-to-peer exchanges.

KryptaPay launched in 2022 and prioritizes fund protection, transaction speed, and cost reduction. The platform allows users to buy, sell, and exchange cryptocurrencies through a peer-to-peer model.

KryptaPay also offers low-cost international money transfer services, particularly from the diaspora to Africa. The platform allows up to 1,000 fee-free transactions as long as users do not request withdrawals. KryptaPay never holds cryptocurrencies on its balance sheet. The platform routes digital assets directly between users, which strengthens security and improves transaction transparency.

Users can generate additional income through an active referral system linked to trading activity. Each user accesses a personal dashboard that tracks financial activity in real time. KryptaPay also operates a certified seller program that provides exclusive benefits, a user-based rating system, and responsive customer support.

Oops, something went wrong

Track your investments for FREE with Simply Wall St, the portfolio command center trusted by over 7 million individual investors worldwide.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAM:BMNR) reports over US$6b in unrealized losses tied to rapid Ethereum accumulation and staking activity.

The company has pursued an Ethereum heavy treasury approach, concentrating its exposure in a single crypto asset.

President Erik Nelson has left the company during this period of financial strain, marking a significant leadership transition.

These developments raise questions about BMNR's risk tolerance, treasury management approach, and future direction.

BitMine Immersion Technologies operates in the crypto-focused segment of the digital assets space, with Ethereum at the center of its recent activity. For investors tracking NYSEAM:BMNR, the combination of large on balance sheet crypto exposure and a staking focused approach is now front and center. The current unrealized losses highlight how closely the company's fortunes are tied to crypto market pricing.

With more than US$6b in paper losses and a change in senior leadership, BMNR enters a period where capital allocation choices and risk controls may attract closer scrutiny from shareholders. As you assess the situation, the key questions are how management responds, whether the Ethereum concentration remains intact, and what this might mean for the company's longer term risk profile.

Why Bitmine Immersion Technologies could be great value

For you as an investor, the headline is concentration risk: BitMine has tied its balance sheet and share price tightly to Ethereum by owning roughly 4.24 million ETH and pushing ahead with a staking heavy model even while crypto prices are under pressure. The reported US$6b in unrealized losses, together with the decision to terminate President Erik Nelson without cause and pay US$605,000 in separation benefits, points to a period where governance decisions, capital allocation and investor trust are likely to be in sharp focus, especially compared with better diversified peers like Coinbase, Marathon Digital or Riot Platforms.

The recent charter amendment to raise authorized common shares from 500,000,000 to 50,000,000,000, large ETH purchases such as the 40,302 ETH buy, and plans for the Made in America Validator Network all feed into a story of an Ethereum centric treasury and staking platform rather than a traditional mining or diversified digital assets firm. How you interpret this news will likely depend on whether you see BitMine primarily as a high beta proxy for Ethereum or as a treasury manager aiming to build an income stream from staking and validator operations.

⚠️ Extreme single asset exposure, with over 4.24 million ETH and more than US$6b in paper losses, leaves the balance sheet highly sensitive to further Ethereum price swings.

⚠️ Governance and dilution risk, with the jump to 50,000,000,000 authorized shares and a leadership change, may concern investors focused on ownership stability.

⚠️ Liquidity and market impact risk, as any large scale ETH sale could affect market pricing and turn unrealized losses into realized ones.

🎁 Staking and validator plans through the Made in America Validator Network could create an ETH based yield stream if execution matches the company's Ethereum focused model.

From here, you might watch how the board fills the leadership gap, whether BitMine continues to add to its ETH position or pauses, and how it uses its greatly expanded share authorization, as these choices will signal risk tolerance and capital priorities. For a broader sense of how other investors are interpreting this Ethereum heavy story, you can check community narratives on the company's page by following perspectives from the wider investor community.

Justin Sun plans to add between $50 million and $100 million worth of bitcoin BTC$78,885.00 to the blockchain's holdings, the Tron founder told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin fell as low as $74,674 during the Asian morning on Monday, its lowest point since last April with BTC now having lost 21% of its value since Jan. 15.

It would mark as astute purchase in comparison to the hoards of digital asset treasury (DAT) companies that raised money to purchase crypto at record highs last year, many of which are now facing losses of more than 30% on their holdings, according to bitcointreasuries.

Binance also announced that it would purchase $1 billion worth of bitcoin at the tail end of last week with the funds being allocated to the exchange's user protection fund.

TRX$0.2840 is currently trading at $0.284 having outperformed bitcoin in recent months, it remains above its December low of $0.27 and in a macro sense remains in an uptrend since late 2022.

A newsletter built for market enthusiasts by market enthusiasts. Top stories, top movers, and trade ideas delivered to your inbox every weekday before and after the market closes.

Barry Silbert, CEO of cryptocurrency conglomerate Digital Currency Group, described the latest cryptocurrency crash as a god-sent opportunity poised to trigger significant capital inflows back into the sector.

In an X post, Silbert referred to the market slump as a “gift from the crypto gods,” suggesting that it is clearing out excess leverage and “crap tokens.” 

“A massive capital rotation into crypto is about to begin. Time to pick your fighter,” the cryptocurrency mogul projected.

Silbert's forecast follows a sharp market drop over the weekend, pushing Bitcoin and Ethereum to their lowest levels in months. Bitcoin, for instance, sank below $75,000, hitting levels last seen in April.

Nearly $800 million was liquidated from the market in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass, with $600 million in levered longs wiped out. The market sentiment plunged into “Extreme Fear” territory.

Notably, Michael Saylor, who spearheads Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR), hinted the company would buy the latest dip and add to its Bitcoin position.

Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $76,926.08, down 2.15% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

Silbert shared his top picks, which include Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), privacy token Zcash (CRYPTO: ZEC), and Bittensor (CRYPTO: TAO), a cryptocurrency tied to decentralized AI.

Investors like Cathie Wood were hopeful of a recovery, citing historical patterns where gold has preceded Bitcoin's bull markets. However, widely followed cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen argued that Bitcoin's rally peaked in October and has been in a bear market since.

Key Takeaways

When millions of pages of newly released records began circulating under what have become known as the Epstein Files , one pattern quietly stood out: Jeffrey Epstein's repeated presence around early cryptocurrency institutions.

Not as a coder.

Not as a public evangelist.

But as a donor, investor, correspondent, and private interlocutor, appearing at moments when Bitcoin's future governance, funding, and legitimacy were unusually fragile.

This has led some online commentators to pose an extreme question: Was Jeffrey Epstein connected to Bitcoin's creators or even Satoshi Nakamoto himself?

The documents do not support that conclusion.

But they do support a narrower, more troubling reality: Epstein moved inside the same funding channels, academic labs, and elite networks that helped stabilize Bitcoin at a pivotal moment, while also expressing strong views about rival cryptocurrencies and future digital money systems.

This article explains what the evidence actually shows.

Jeffrey Epstein was a financier  who cultivated access to academics, technologists, and policymakers. 

Despite pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor, Epstein remained socially active among elite circles for over a decade.

The Epstein files  refer to a huge collection of documents, emails, photos, videos, court records and other materials gathered by U.S. law enforcement related to the case of Jeffrey Epstein, an American financier who was convicted of sex offences and later faced federal sex-trafficking charges before dying in jail in 2019. They include:

These files were mostly sealed (not public) during the years of investigations and legal cases, but in late 2025 and early 2026 the U.S. government began releasing them under a new law called the Epstein Files Transparency Act. 

This effort has made millions of pages of documents (and thousands of media files) available publicly in redacted form, meaning sensitive personal info and some content has been blacked out or removed to protect victims and other legal concerns.

One can access material commonly called the “Epstein files” mainly through official court and government releases. The most reliable sources are federal court dockets (such as filings from the Southern District of New York) and documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice. 

When judges unseal records, they're posted as PDFs on court websites or linked by the DOJ and prosecutors. These releases are usually redacted to protect victims' privacy and ongoing legal interests.

Another route is filing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with federal agencies that investigated the case. FOIA can sometimes produce additional records not already online, but responses often take months and may still arrive heavily redacted, or be denied, because of privacy or legal exemptions.

However, be cautious with unofficial sites claiming to have “full” or “secret” files; stick to government sources and established media to avoid misinformation or illegally obtained material.

In October 2016, Epstein wrote an email  that would later draw attention for an unexpected reason.

Corresponding with Raafat Abdulla Saad Al Sabbagh, an advisor connected to the Saudi royal court, Epstein floated what he described as “two radical ideas” for new currencies.

One proposal was explicitly cultural and religious in framing.

Epstein suggested creating:

“The Middle East could have its own sharia … for internal use amongst Muslims,” he wrote, adding that a digital currency “like bitcoin” could be adapted to comply with Islamic finance principles.

Most strikingly, Epstein claimed:

“I have spoken to some of the founders of Bitcoin who are very excited.”

The email does not name these individuals, nor does it show that the idea progressed beyond discussion. But it establishes several facts beyond dispute:

To understand why Epstein's crypto involvement matters, it's necessary to rewind to 2014-2015, a period often overlooked in Bitcoin's origin story.

At that time:

This vacuum created a problem: who would pay the people maintaining Bitcoin's core code?

Into that vacuum stepped the MIT Media Lab.

The Media Lab launched the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), positioning itself as a neutral academic home for Bitcoin research and development. The DCI began paying several key Bitcoin Core developers, a move widely viewed as stabilizing.

What was not publicly known at the time, but is now confirmed by the Epstein Files, is that Jeffrey Epstein was a donor to the MIT Media Lab during this period.

Jeffrey Epstein files reveal he was linked to Bitcoin early ecosystem 🚨

Here's what's happening:

Epstein was close  to Bitcoin funding channels, early developers and political figures who now influence crypto regulation.

Emails show Media Lab leadership explaining to Epstein that:

One message explicitly notes that “gift funds” were used to move quickly and secure these developers. Epstein replied approvingly, referring to one by name.

This does not mean Epstein controlled Bitcoin.

Bitcoin remained open-source and decentralized.

But it does mean that at a critical juncture, an academic institution partially funded by Epstein became the primary paymaster for Bitcoin's most influential developers.

That fact alone is historically significant.

Epstein also appeared in early investment rounds for Blockstream, a company closely tied to Bitcoin's infrastructure and development ecosystem.

In a 2014 email, Blockstream co-founder Austin Hill informed Epstein that his allocation in a seed round was being increased tenfold, from $50,000 to $500,000.

Blockstream later played a central role in Bitcoin's scaling debates and technical roadmap. Epstein's participation again shows financial proximity, not operational authority, but repeated proximity nonetheless.

The Blockstream connection brings another important name into focus: Adam Back.

Back is a cryptographer whose earlier work on Hashcash influenced Bitcoin's proof-of-work system. He later became a central figure at Blockstream.

The Epstein Files contain correspondence in which Epstein is asked directly about Adam Back.

In a November 2014 email exchange, Epstein was queried by a contact about Back , noting that Epstein and MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito had invested in his company. 

Epstein's reply was brief but unambiguous:

“I like him.”

The message is short, but its implications are notable:

This further reinforces the documented pattern: Epstein had direct access to individuals who played foundational roles in Bitcoin's technical and institutional evolution.

There is no evidence that Adam Back acted improperly or that Epstein influenced Bitcoin's code. The record simply shows proximity, familiarity, and investment.

One of the most widely circulated documents from the Epstein Files is a July 31, 2014, email titled “Stellar isn't so Stellar ,” sent by Austin Hill, a co-founder of Blockstream. The message was addressed to a small group of recipients, including Jeffrey Epstein, MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.

The language of the email reflects the competitive environment of the period. In mid-2014, the cryptocurrency sector was still small, funding was limited, and technical legitimacy was closely tied to investor signaling. 

Disputes over ideology, scalability, and governance frequently overlapped with business rivalries, particularly as Bitcoin-aligned developers and companies sought to distinguish themselves from alternative digital ledger systems.

I warned you about Bitcoin. The facts aren't flashy, but they matter, and they have to be acknowledged.

It was created anonymously by design, manipulated to drive speculative gains, and used in ways most people can't even imagine.

— Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) February 1, 2026 



Jeffrey Epstein's inclusion on the email chain indicates that he was copied on discussions about these competitive dynamics. 

However, there is no evidence in the released correspondence that Epstein authored the message, shaped its arguments, or directed the position being expressed. The document only shows awareness and exposure.

In subsequent public commentary, Ripple's former Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, publicly commented on the broader implications of the Epstein Files, while stopping short of making specific allegations.

In a public post, Schwartz wrote :

“I hate to be a conspiracy theorist, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if this is just the tip of a giant iceberg.”

The statement was framed as a personal reaction to the scope of the newly released Epstein-related documents, rather than as a conclusion drawn from the Ripple- or Stellar-related emails themselves.

Importantly, Schwartz also stated separately that he was not aware of any connections between Jeffrey Epstein and Ripple, XRP, or Stellar, and that he knew of no evidence that anyone at Ripple or Stellar had met with Epstein or worked with individuals closely connected to him. 

He further noted that indirect links between Epstein and people connected to Bitcoin were not unusual given Epstein's wealth and access, and did not, by themselves, indicate misconduct.

This is an email from Austin Hill to Jeffrey Epstein explaining that Hill felt that support for Ripple or Stellar made someone an enemy/opponent. It seems quite likely that Hill and others expressed similar views to many other people.

— David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) February 1, 2026 



The document, therefore, described Epstein's proximity to early crypto discussions without demonstrating decision-making authority, strategic direction, or involvement in actions taken against Ripple or Stellar.

However, the Epstein Files also contain material referencing broader technology investment trends during the same period. One document  notes that Google Ventures invested in OpenCoin, the company behind Ripple, describing it as a digital ledger technology with similarities to Bitcoin.

This investment was publicly disclosed at the time and was part of a broader wave of corporate interest in blockchain technologies.

The Epstein Files have also revived scrutiny of Gary Gensler, particularly because of his academic and regulatory roles in the years surrounding the rise of cryptocurrency.

Public records confirm that Gensler taught courses on blockchain and digital currency at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after leaving government service and before his appointment as Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. His MIT lectures focused on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and financial regulation and were publicly available at the time.

Separately, emails released in the Epstein Files show that Jeffrey Epstein discussed Gensler privately in 2018. In one exchange, Epstein asked contacts about Gensler's views on digital currencies, writing: “gary gensler coming earlier don't know him wants to talk digital currencies. views?” The correspondence does not show a meeting taking place, nor does it indicate collaboration, instruction, or influence over regulatory actions.

After Gensler became SEC Chair, the agency pursued a high-profile enforcement case against Ripple concerning the classification of XRP. That case has since become one of the most consequential legal battles in U.S. crypto regulation.

Some online commentators have asserted  that Epstein's documented interest in crypto, combined with Gensler's MIT role and later SEC actions, demonstrates coordinated intent or external direction behind the Ripple case. These claims often circulate alongside assertions involving intelligence agencies or foreign influence.

I told you all 31 Dec 2022 that Gary Gensler was directed through Epstein and Mossad to go after Ripple and XRP. Meanwhile the Bitcoin foundation was backed by Epstein.

Now you know it is true. pic.twitter.com/ouOjMYeNQx 

— Patrick L Riley (@Acquired_Savant) January 31, 2026 



However, no evidence in the Epstein Files supports those conclusions. The released documents do not show Epstein directing regulatory enforcement, influencing the SEC, or coordinating actions against Ripple or XRP. 

The Epstein Files also include email exchanges between Epstein and Peter Thiel from 2014 onward. In one July 2014 exchange, Thiel asked Epstein whether regulatory pressure on Bitcoin might be increasing, writing: “Do you think this is the first step in upping the anti-BTC pressure?”

The message reflects uncertainty among early investors about how governments might approach Bitcoin regulation at the time. It does not reference Ripple, Stellar, or enforcement actions, nor does it indicate coordination with regulators.

Separately, public records confirm  that Thiel later funded blockchain-related ventures and that Vitalik Buterin participated in the Thiel Fellowship program before the launch of Ethereum. Ethereum launched approximately one year after the 2014 email exchange.

Peculiar that Vitalik Buterin is a Thiel fellow and Ethereum launched about a year after this email, aiming to supplant Bitcoin. 

🤔🤔 https://t.co/19tDAWK0TZ 

— grubles (@notgrubles) January 31, 2026 



There is no evidence in the released documents that Ethereum was created to “supplant” Bitcoin as part of a coordinated effort involving Epstein, Thiel, or regulators. Ethereum's development, funding, and technical design have been extensively documented through public white papers, developer communications, and open-source repositories.

The Epstein Files also contain correspondence linking Jeffrey Epstein to individuals associated with Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency launched in 2016.

In April 2018, an email  from Madars Virza, a mathematician and cryptographer involved with Zcash, was sent to Epstein under the subject line “Fwd: The Zcash Company DRAFT K-1.” The message discussed tax documentation related to Zcash holdings and distributions. 

Virza wrote that approximately $200,000 in income reflected proceeds from coin auctions and company sales used to finance operations, noting that the company maintained custody of the coins and that taxes would need to be addressed accordingly.

From the released epstein files, emails between epistein jeffery and Satoshi himself surface.

Makes you wonder who Satoshi is himself?

— BMS (@bloomstarbms) February 1, 2026 



The email also referenced the possibility of a future fork in the Zcash blockchain, explaining that if a fork occurred, control of private keys would allow access to both resulting branches, though only the company-endorsed branch would ultimately be supported. 

The correspondence reflects a technical and administrative discussion about cryptocurrency holdings and taxation, rather than protocol design or governance decisions.

Epstein's receipt indicates that he was involved, directly or indirectly, in discussions concerning Zcash-related financial matters. The documents do not specify the size, structure, or duration of any investment, nor do they show Epstein participating in technical development or decision-making for the project.

Additional emails from April 2019 show personal correspondence between Virza and Epstein's staff, arranging a meeting at Epstein's Manhattan residence shortly before Epstein's arrest later that year. 

In these exchanges, Virza referenced sending Epstein a gift package that included books on Bitcoin and probability, along with a handwritten letter and a religious card. The emails describe logistical details such as delivery confirmation and meeting arrangements.

In one message, Virza wrote positively  about Epstein following a meeting, describing him as “a torrent of positive energy.” The correspondence appears social in nature and does not discuss cryptocurrency policy, investment strategy, or technical matters.

These emails confirm familiarity and direct contact between Epstein and individuals connected to the Zcash ecosystem. They do not establish Epstein as a founder, developer, or decision-maker within Zcash, nor do they indicate how he really influenced the project's technical or governance direction.

The Epstein Files also include a February 2016 email from Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, sent to investors during a critical period in Bitcoin's block-size debate.

In the email, Armstrong noted that Bitcoin's price and trading volume remained higher than 2015 averages but acknowledged significant month-to-month volatility. 

He emphasized Coinbase's focus on expanding Bitcoin adoption through additional payment methods, countries, and simplified user limits. Alongside this commercial strategy, Armstrong addressed ongoing disagreements within the Bitcoin community over how the network should scale.

Armstrong wrote that Coinbase was working “behind the scenes” with multiple teams to help ensure that Bitcoin's development was “not held back by any of the early idealists.” He expressed optimism that Bitcoin's upgrade mechanism, including miner voting, would function as designed and suggested that the network would soon adopt a block-size increase to 2MB. 

He predicted that once an initial “hard fork” succeeded, Bitcoin's price would respond positively and that future forks could occur periodically as part of protocol improvement.

— Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) February 1, 2026 



At the time the email was written, several proposals advocating larger blocks were being discussed within the Bitcoin ecosystem, including initiatives commonly associated with what later became known as the Bitcoin Classic era. Armstrong's message reflects the expectation, held by some industry participants in early 2016, that a near-term hard fork was likely.

In practice, no such fork occurred in 2016. Subsequent efforts to increase Bitcoin's block size through coordinated upgrades, including the SegWit2x proposal backed by several major companies, were ultimately abandoned  in late 2017 due to insufficient consensus among miners, developers, and node operators.

The block-size debate became one of the most consequential governance disputes in Bitcoin's history. Critics of the proposed hard forks argued that they were driven largely by corporate interests, including exchanges and payment processors, rather than by grassroots developer consensus. Supporters countered that larger blocks were necessary for scalability and mainstream adoption.

The inclusion of Armstrong's investor email in the Epstein Files does not suggest coordination with Jeffrey Epstein or involvement by Epstein in Bitcoin's scaling decisions. Instead, it provides contemporaneous documentation of how major industry participants viewed Bitcoin governance at the time and how commercial actors anticipated influencing the network's technical trajectory.

No. The available evidence does not support the claim that Jeffrey Epstein was Satoshi Nakamoto, nor that he authored Bitcoin's white paper, mined its early blocks, or controlled Satoshi's cryptographic keys.

What the Epstein Files and related records do show is that Epstein had a sustained interest in cryptocurrency and was proximate to parts of Bitcoin's early institutional ecosystem. 

He donated to academic programs that later funded Bitcoin Core developers, invested in infrastructure companies such as Blockstream, corresponded with prominent crypto figures, and discussed digital currency design, including a proposal for a Sharia-compliant cryptocurrency. These activities establish awareness, access, and investment, not authorship or control.

What the records do not show is any technical fingerprint tying Epstein to Bitcoin's creation: there is no evidence of early code commits, no linkage to Satoshi's known emails or forum posts, no control of early wallets, and no contemporaneous documentation placing Epstein at the origin of the protocol in 2008–2009.

The evidence reviewed in the Epstein Files does not indicate that cryptocurrency as a technology is in imminent danger. What it does highlight are structural risks that have existed since crypto's early years and that continue to shape its future.

First, it is important to separate technology from institutions. Open-source blockchains such as Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin were designed to function without reliance on any single individual, donor, company, or government. 

The Bitcoin and Ethereum networks continue to operate today regardless of who funded developers, invested in infrastructure firms, or debated governance behind closed doors in the past. That resilience is one of crypto's core strengths.

However, the documents do underscore several long-standing vulnerabilities:

So the greater risks lie in how transparently ecosystems manage funding, how robustly they defend decentralization in practice , and how clearly they engage with regulators and the public.

Crypto's long-term viability will depend less on who once stood near its institutions and more on whether its communities continue to uphold the principles of openness, verifiability, and distributed control on which the technology was founded.

Even amid the present chaos, Epstein Files revelations, renewed regulatory noise, and market volatility, Bitcoin is still trading around the $78,000 level. That matters. Assets on the verge of collapse do not typically hold deep liquidity, global bid support, or sustained institutional participation at those prices.

The recent drawdowns  resemble historical Bitcoin corrections, not structural failure. Previous cycles saw 30–50% declines during periods of fear, followed by stabilization or recovery once uncertainty cleared.

The Epstein Files have fueled narratives, but markets are responding more to macro forces: interest rates, liquidity conditions, ETF flows, and risk sentiment. None of those indicate a systemic breakdown of Bitcoin's network or demand.

In practical terms: Bitcoin could remain volatile, correct further, or trade sideways, but a move to zero would require a total collapse in global participation, not just controversy or bad headlines. There is no evidence of that happening now.

$BTC  is about to crash another 66% to $28k and wipe out all longs.

Every cycle ends the same:

• 2017: $19k peak → -84%• 2021: $69k peak → -78%• 2025: $126k peak → -77%

Big cycle says the top is in. Liquidation comes next.#BTC  #Bitcoin  #Crypto  pic.twitter.com/UFWvwcG0Kh 

— Shawn (@ShawnCT_) January 31, 2026 



However, Bitcoin isn't immune to sharp drops, but at $78k with global infrastructure intact, the current turmoil looks like stress, not terminal failure.

During periods of controversy and intense headlines, users can protect themselves by focusing on fundamentals rather than reacting to fear-driven narratives. Verifying information through primary sources, avoiding rushed trading decisions based on viral claims, and maintaining strong operational security can significantly reduce risk. 

While documents and discussions may raise uncomfortable questions, no single revelation changes how decentralized networks function day to day, making patience, verification, and personal security the most effective defenses amid uncertainty.

XRP Over Bitcoin, Gold & the Dollar? What YoungHoon Kim Claims — and What the Differences Actually Reveal









Did Jeffrey Epstein claim connections to Bitcoin's founders?


Yes. In a 2016 email released in the Epstein Files, Jeffrey Epstein claimed that he had “spoken to some of the founders of Bitcoin” while discussing the idea of creating a Sharia-compliant digital currency. The email does not name those individuals, and there is no evidence showing that the discussions went beyond conversation or that Epstein held any role in Bitcoin's creation.




Was Jeffrey Epstein involved in undermining Ripple (XRP) or Stellar (XLM)?


There is no evidence that Epstein directed actions against Ripple or Stellar. However, Epstein was copied on a 2014 email from Blockstream co-founder Austin Hill criticizing investor overlap with Ripple and Stellar during early crypto rivalries. The document shows awareness of competitive tensions, not coordination or decision-making by Epstein.




Did Epstein influence Bitcoin through MIT or Blockstream?


The Epstein Files confirm that Epstein donated to the MIT Media Lab during the period when its Digital Currency Initiative began funding Bitcoin Core developers after the Bitcoin Foundation collapsed. Epstein also invested in Blockstream. These records show financial proximity to institutions supporting Bitcoin at a critical moment, but they do not show control over Bitcoin's protocol or governance.




Is crypto's future in danger because of the Epstein Files and recent Bitcoin volatility?


The evidence does not indicate that cryptocurrency's future is in imminent danger. Despite controversy and recent market volatility, Bitcoin continues to trade around $78,000 with global liquidity, active infrastructure, and ongoing network operation. The Epstein Files highlight structural risks such as funding concentration and reputational exposure, but not systemic failure of crypto technology itself.

The Epstein Files highlight structural risks such as funding concentration and reputational exposure, but not systemic failure of crypto technology itself.

The right ICO development is critical for maintaining the security of raised funds, regulations, and token distribution. A proper ICO does not expose developers to technical risks, fraud while providing security in the crypto space. Partnering with an ICO Development Company gives businesses security, regulation, and a scalable platform to attract serious investors. Security prevents cyber threats, develops relationships with investors, promotes participation, and attracts investors from national and international markets. These benefits lead to long-term growth.

As the ICO landscape matures, security becomes a basic requirement for project success. Creating a strong security infrastructure from the beginning is a priority due to increasing cyberattacks, regulations, and informed investors. Security around ICO development is essential to ensure that token transactions, investor data, and smart contracts are secure, and to prevent reputational damage. Experienced ICO Development Companies implement several layers of security at all stages of the development process, ensuring that a stable infrastructure is in place and that there is constant monitoring. This leads to successful fundraising and investor confidence.

Trust is built over time by transparency, reliability and security. In the world of cryptocurrency, where scams and technical problems have proved fatal for many projects, security remains an important factor of legitimacy for the digital currency. An experienced ICO Development Company proves that it is reliable by verifying smart contracts and safeguarding funds and being ready for legal compliance on time, which persuades investors to fund an ICO. Trust increases both participation rates and time commitment.

Security not only protects assets but also plays a crucial role in expanding investor participation. A well-protected ICO platform attracts global investors who prioritize safety and reliability. When users experience smooth onboarding, secure transactions, and transparent systems, they are more likely to recommend the project to others. An ICO Development Company that emphasizes security-driven user experience helps businesses reach broader audiences while maintaining trust standards.

Smart contracts ease fundraising, token issuance, and disbursements to investors. Their vulnerabilities can lead to investor losses and financial failure of the tokens' associated projects. Professional ICO Development Company applies the best practices in the industry, executes thorough testing and obtains professionals to review the code to prevent internal and external attacks as the blockchain automation process becomes more complex.

Security and compliance are also closely linked for keeping ICO projects sustainable. Technical security solutions protect the project from cyber threats, while compliance helps in surviving in the long run. Investors prefer projects that show such well-developed infrastructures. An experienced ICO Development Company, with compliance tools like identity verification, secure data storage, and transaction transparency, keeps your project aligned with global standards.

Lastly, professionalism is an important factor in ICO. A secure platform developed by professionals not only shows technical expertise but also a mature business. An experienced ICO Development Company will lower the risk through proven methodologies, ensure scalability and ensure overall transparency. These traits and reputation will encourage larger investments and longer business relationships.

Security is important beyond the ICO itself: well-secured projects are less likely to have issues and can better function in the long term, and tokens are held by people on trusted platforms. The ICO Development Company prioritizes monitoring and updating assets as the ecosystem progresses, ensuring asset safety.

Trustworthy and credible ICO development requires effective communication with investors. Security involves project communication and strategies, and applies to aspects ranging from smart contracts and compliance and transparency of raising and managing funds, to continuing project security and maintenance over time. An ICO Development Company offers protection, scalability, and regulatory compliance to your network. When investors feel confident that the platform is safe and transparent, they are more likely to participate, allowing the project to reach its funding goals sooner, and providing tokens with sustainable value.

The crypto market crash continued on Monday, with Bitcoin and most altcoins being in the red. Bitcoin price dropped to $75,000 while the market capitalization of all coins dropped by 4.4% in the last 24 hours to $2.55 trillion.

Most altcoins were in the red, with the top laggards being tokens like River, Monero, Ethereum, Nexo, Chainlink, and Kaspa. Ethereum dropped by 10% in the last 24 hours, moving to a low of $2,200.

Crypto market crashed as Fear and Greed Index fell 

The ongoing crypto market crash happened as the Fear and Greed Index moved to the extreme fear zone of 15, the lowest level in over a month.

The rising fear is happening as many investors capitulate and start selling as the industry continues to underperform the market. For example, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs shed assets in January, continuing a trend that has been going on for months.

Data shows that the 24-hour liquidations stood at over $735 million, while the open interest dropped by 5% to over $108 billion. Falling open interest is a sign that investors are not using as much leverage as they did in the past.

At the same time, the elevated liquidations are happening as exchanges shut leveraged trades after hitting their margin levels. Ethereum positions worth over $272 million were shut, while Bitcoin positions worth $249 million were closed. 

Kevin Warsh and Iran tensions

There are two broad reasons why the crypto crash is happening this year. For example, Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh to become the next Federal Reserve Chair. 

Historically, Warsh has always been a hawk who has opposed quantitative easing and criticized the Fed for cutting interest rates too early. Therefore, while Trump promised a Fed Chair who would cut interest rates to 1, chances are that Warsh will not do that. 

Risk of a war in the Middle East

The other key reason behind the ongoing crypto market crash is the ongoing fears of a war in the Middle East. Iranian leaders warned that there will be a regional war if the United States attacked, which explains why Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) have retreated.

Donald Trump, on the other hand, has continued to accumulate an armada in the region. He is also under pressure from hawks like Lindsey Graham, Mike Pompeo, and Mark Levin, whom he watches all the time on Fox News.

These neocons have convinced Trump that the only way to deal with Iran is to topple the regime. Therefore, the crypto market crash happened because Bitcoin and other altcoins are not safe havens. 

Bitcoin price technicals points to more downside



The weekly timeline chart shows that the Bitcoin price is signaling more downside in the near term. It has moved below the key support at $80,488, the lower side of the bearish flag pattern. 

Bitcoin has also slumped below the strong, pivot, and reverse level of the Murrey Math Lines tool. It remains below the 50-week moving average and the lower side of the rising wedge tool.

Therefore, the most likely scenario is where Bitcoin continues falling, potentially to the ultimate support level at $50,000. Such a move will point to more downside in the crypto market.

Retrospective studies suggest that early time-of-day (ToD) infusions of immunochemotherapy may improve efficacy. However, prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to validate it. In this randomized phase 3 LungTIME-C01 trial, 210 patients with treatment naive stage IIIC–IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lacking driver mutations were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either an early or late ToD group, defined by the administration of the first four cycles of an anti-PD-1 agent before or after 15:00 h. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), while secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). After a median follow-up of 28.7 months, the median PFS was 11.3 months (95% confidence interval (CI) = 9.2–13.4) in the early ToD group and 5.7 months (95% CI = 5.2–6.2) in the late ToD group, corresponding to a hazard ratio (HR) for earlier disease progression of 0.40 (95% CI = 0.29–0.55; P < 0.001). The median OS was 28.0 months (95% CI = not estimable (NE)–NE) in the early ToD group and 16.8 months (95% CI = 13.7–19.9) in the late ToD group, corresponding to an HR of an earlier death of 0.42 (95% CI = 0.29–0.60; P < 0.001). Treatment-related adverse events were consistent with the established safety profile, with no new safety signals observed. No significant differences in immune-related adverse events were observed between the two groups. Over the first four cycles, morning circulating CD8+ T cells increased in the early ToD group, whereas they declined in the late ToD group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the ratio of activated (CD38+ HLA-DR+) versus exhausted (TIM-3+PD-1+) CD8+ T cells was higher in the early ToD group (P < 0.001) compared with the late ToD group (P < 0.001). In summary, our study indicates that early ToD immunochemotherapy substantially improves PFS and OS and is associated with enhanced antitumor CD8+ T cell characteristics compared with late ToD treatment.

(a) Distribution of first 4 infusion times among 210 patients, who were divided into early time-of-day (ToD) infusion group and late ToD group. (b) Histogram of median times of the first 4 infusions per patient (n = 210).

(a) Forest plots of the univariate and multivariate Cox regression results for progression-free survival (PFS) (n = 210). (b) Forest plots of the univariate and multivariate Cox regression results for overall survival (OS) (n = 210). P values (two-sided), hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals of HRs were estimated using univariable or multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, and P values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Data are presented as HR (points) with 95% CIs (horizontal lines). ICI, immune checkpoint inhibitor. LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma. LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma. ECOG PS, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status. LIPI, Lung Immune Prognostic Index.

The tumor response was assessed by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC) (n = 210). P values were determined using a two-sided chi-square test. ToD, time-of-day. PR, partial response. SD, stable disease. PD, progressive disease.

Patient values are normalized to individual baseline levels and assessed after 2 cycles (prior to cycle 3) and 4 cycles (prior to cycle 5) of treatment. Line-point graphs depict dynamic changes of CD3+ T cell proportion (a), CD8+ T cell proportion (b), CD4+ T cell proportion (f), B cell proportion (g), NK cell proportion (h) and CD8+/CD4+ T cell ratio (i) in individual patients from the early and late time-of-day (ToD) groups. Colored lines link sequential measurements from individual patients. The horizontal dotted line represents the normalized baseline (ratio = 1.0). Linear regressions (solid lines) with shaded 95% confidence intervals illustrate changes in CD4+ T cell proportions (c), B cell proportions (d) and NK cell proportions (e) over time in patients from the early and late time-of-day (ToD) groups. Data are presented as mean ± s.e. of the mean (s.e.m.). Dotted horizontal lines indicate the normalized baseline (ratio = 1.0). P values were determined using a permutation test (two-sided) and two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (two-sided), without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Flow cytometric analyses of CD4+, B and NK cells were performed on paired blood samples collected at baseline, after 2 cycles and after 4 cycles from 61 patients in the early ToD group and 44 patients in the late ToD group (n = 105 total patients; n = 315 total samples).

Representative flow cytometry gating strategy used to identify CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+ T cells and TIM-3+PD-1+CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (a). Linear regressions (solid lines) with shaded 95% confidence intervals illustrate changes in CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cell proportions (b). Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Dotted horizontal lines indicate the normalized baseline (ratio = 1.0). P values were determined using a permutation test (two-sided) and two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (two-sided), without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Line-point graphs depict dynamic changes of CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cell (c), TIM-3+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cell proportion (d) and CD38+ HLA-DR+/ TIM-3+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cell ratio (e) in individual patients from the early and late time-of-day (ToD) groups. Colored lines connect serial measurements from the same patient. Dotted horizontal lines indicate the normalized baseline (ratio = 1.0). PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometric analyses of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T, B and NK cells were performed on paired blood samples collected at baseline, after 2 cycles and after 4 cycles from 61 patients in the early ToD group and 44 patients in the late ToD group (n = 105 total patients; n = 315 total samples). CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells and TIM-3+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cells were assessed in paired cryopreserved PBMCs collected at baseline, after 2 cycles and after 4 cycles from 14 patients in the early ToD group and 25 patients in the late ToD group (n = 39 total patients; n = 117 total samples).

The global demand for critical metals is rising quickly, prompting many countries to explore the possibility of extracting these valuable resources from the ocean floor. A new international study has revealed that this push toward deep-sea mining may have less overall environmental impact than scientists once feared. At the same time, the research shows clear local damage, with species diversity dropping by about one third along the paths cut by mining equipment.

The study also uncovered a major surprise. Hundreds of previously unknown species were found living nearly 4,000 meters below the ocean's surface, highlighting just how little is known about these remote environments.

Exploring One of Earth's Least Known Ecosystems

Marine biologists from multiple countries joined forces in a large research effort to document life on the deep-sea floor of the Pacific Ocean, one of the most unexplored regions on the planet.

The research, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, was driven in part by growing commercial and geopolitical interest in the area.

"Critical metals are needed for our green transition, and they are in short supply. Several of these metals are found in large quantities on the deep-sea floor, but until now, no one has shown how they can be extracted or what environmental impact this would have," says marine biologist Thomas Dahlgren, that together with Helena Wiklund, also at the University of Gothenburg, have participated in the research project.

Five Years of Research and 160 Days at Sea

The project followed the International Seabed Authority's (ISA) guidelines for baseline studies and environmental impact assessments (see fact box).

Over five years, researchers cataloged marine life and tested mining impacts in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a vast region of the Pacific Ocean located between Mexico and Hawaii. The results showed that areas directly disturbed by mining equipment experienced a 37 percent decline in animal numbers and a 32 percent reduction in species diversity.

"The research required 160 days at sea and five years of work. Our study will be important for the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which regulates mineral mining in international waters," says Thomas Dahlgren.

Life at 4,000 Meters Below the Surface

The study area lies 4,000 meters beneath the ocean surface, where sunlight never reaches and food is extremely limited. In this environment, the sediment layer grows at a rate of just one thousandth of a millimeter per year.

To put the scarcity of life into perspective, a single seafloor sample from the North Sea can contain up to 20,000 animals. A similar sample from the deep Pacific seabed contains roughly the same number of species, but only about 200 individual animals.

Researchers collected 4,350 animals larger than 0.3 mm living in and on the seabed. From these samples, 788 species were identified. Most belonged to groups such as marine bristle worms, crustaceans, and mollusks, including snails and mussels.

The team also identified a new solitaire coral, that are described in another study.

Unknown Species Ranges and Long-Term Risks

"I have been working in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone for over 13 years, and this is by far the largest study that has been conducted. In Gothenburg, we led the identification of marine polychaete worms. Since most species have not been described previously, molecular (DNA) data was crucial in facilitating studies of biodiversity and ecology on the seabed," says Thomas Dahlgren.

As the inventory progressed, scientists noticed that deep-sea communities changed naturally over time, likely in response to shifts in how much food reached the ocean floor. However, researchers still do not know how widely these species are distributed across the Pacific's deep-sea regions.

"It is now important to try to predict the risk of biodiversity loss as a result of mining. This requires us to investigate the biodiversity of the 30 percent of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone that has been protected. At present, we have virtually no idea what lives there," says Adrian Glover, senior author from the Natural History Museum of London.

These maps detailed the Great Mongolian Road, which included key settlements and important water sources.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The Great Mongolian Road was once a pivotal east-west Silk Road route across the Gobi Desert (a camel caravan mainstay over 100 years ago), but the route had long been lost to time. Now, a secret set of century-old Japanese military maps has revealed the route once more—and in striking detail. 

Between 1873 and 1945, the Japanese Imperial Army created gaihōzu, which roughly translates to “maps of outer lands.” Originally devised for military planning during Japan's imperial expansion efforts, they still collectively serve as one of the most comprehensive cartographic records of east and inner Asia. 

In a new study published in the Journal of Historical Geography, a team of researchers said the gaihōzu display rich detail of many territories beyond Japanese control and “now serve as geographical time capsules, preserving landscapes since transformed by modernization.” 

The research team had four map sheets from the Toa Yochizu—the “Maps of East Asia,” which were drawn between 1901 and 1922—highlighting a region starting near Mongolia's eastern border with China and moving west. The study said that while the Japanese mapmakers themselves weren't traveling the roads and mapping the terrain, they pored over known sources at the time—largely Russian and Chinese maps already in existence—and combined everything for Japanese use, showing “the remarkable accuracy of the maps and the persistence of the geographic features that shaped historical trade routes.”

The painstaking detail in the maps highlights everything from road locations and settlements right down to oases and water wells. The present-day scholars studying the map used field research to verify roughly 750 miles of the documents as exceedingly accurate, and saw that they reveal a complete infrastructure system that enabled desert caravan travel. The team noted that at least 50 pivotal points along the way—including wells, springs, and monasteries—were accurate. 

“The gaihōzu capture not merely routes but complete support systems, including water sources, terrain features, and settlements vital for navigation and survival in these harsh arid environments,” the study authors wrote. “By mapping this historical corridor, these once-secret military documents provide valuable baseline data for historical geography, cultural heritage preservation, and environmental change assessment across the landscapes of Asia.” 

The gaihōzu were classified during World War II, and while many were destroyed at the end of the war, thousands of pages were saved and sent to universities and libraries. 

Field research showed that the route connecting northern China with Central Asia included water sources spaced roughly 15 miles apart, which was the typical distance a camel caravan would have traveled in a day. At times, the mapping offered multiple routes—often based on the seasons, water availability, or security concerns—showing that over time, the Silk Road may have shifted to accommodate the needs of travelers. 

“Routes were not arbitrary lines across the desert, but carefully calibrated responses to environmental constraints,” the authors wrote. 

This gaihōzu represents the first detailed account of a lesser-known section of the Silk Road. “The gaihōzu document much more than geography: they capture the complex infrastructure of water, shelter, and orientation that made survival and trade possible across one of Eurasia's harshest corridors,” the authors wrote. “Although they were created to serve imperial ambitions, these maps have transcended their original purpose to become irreplaceable records of human geographic knowledge.”

Ionizing radiation apparently didn't prevent some types of bacteria from breeding in the water, but astonishingly, they are not the radiation-resistant types expected in an environment like this.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Following the 2011 tsunami that caused massive meltdowns in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, Japan shut down all of its nuclear operations. Recently, however, Japan restarted one of Fukushima's surviving reactors—but that reactor was not the only thing to survive the disaster. 

During the time that the Fukushima plant was abandoned, water seeped into radioactive waste that remained within the reactor buildings. Soon, an environment assumed to be uninhabitable was actually crawling with microbes. Microbes can be a major obstacle during the cleanup that comes with decommissioning nuclear power plants, since many species corrode metal, and swarms of them can turn water murky and reduce visibility. 

Recently, biologists Tomoro Warashina and Akio Kanai from Keio University in Tokyo made an extraordinary discovery when they analyzed samples of microbes taken from the highly radioactive water inside the power plant's torus room, below the reactor building. Bacteria with no special genetic resistance to the harmful effects of radiation were thriving in the sludge. In the face of a nuclear disaster, organisms either perish or evolve. Mutations have made it possible for everything from wolves to a nearly indestructible black mold to thrive in the otherwise hostile environment of Chernobyl even decades later. This is why the scientists expected to find radiation-resistant microbial species such as Deinococcus radiodurans or Methylobacterium radiotolerans in their samples.

As the team explained in a study recently published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, the microbiome they analyzed had been exposed to persistent radiation, and gathering information about such microorganisms is vital for understanding how to deal sustainably with stagnant, radioactive water environments during decommissioning work. “Certain microorganisms are known to have mechanisms that confer resistance to high levels of ionizing radiation,” they wrote.

After testing their water samples for genetic markers of different microbes, Warashina and Kanai discovered that it was teeming with bacteria from the Limnobacter and Brevirhabdus genera. These chemolithotrophic bacteria make their living by oxidizing inorganic compounds such as manganese or sulfides. Sulfur oxidizers benefit from the sulfite oxidase enzyme, which is secreted by their mitochondria and detoxes sulfides by breaking down amino acids containing sulfur. They turn sulfides into harmless sulfates. The scientists also found a smaller amount of iron oxidizers from the Hoeflea and Sphinopyxis genera, which live by converting one form of iron to another.

None of the species found by Kanai and Warashina have superpowers for radiation resistance. Yet despite high levels of ionizing radiation that would have been toxic to many other forms of life, these bacteria were able to thrive. The question is, how? The study's authors observed that the mixture of emergency cooling water and seawater inside the torus room appeared to support the growth of biofilms on the surfaces of metals. Metals are commonly oxidized and corroded by these bacteria, and the scientists reasoned that it's possible the slime covering such bacterial masses may have actually given them extra protection from radiation. The research team also analyzed the microbial communities to see which ones caused the most corrosion and would therefore need to be targeted to prevent metals from breaking down further during the decommissioning process.

“The proportions of bacterial genera known to be radiation resistant were extremely low, suggesting that the impact of radioactivity on selection within the torus room water was minimal,” they said. “In contrast, [most] of the bacterial genera in the torus room water were associated with metal corrosion, indicating that the impact of bacteria on metal corrosion must be considered in long-term decommissioning work.”

Another thing that caught the team's interest was that many of the microbes found in the torus room also thrive in the ocean. It is possible that these bacteria crashed in with the waves of the tsunami or that something about their adaptations to a marine environment also helps them stay alive in the bowels of a dead nuclear reactor. Life, uh, finds a way.

In 1950, in a paper entitled ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence'1, Alan Turing proposed his ‘imitation game'. Now known as the Turing test, it addressed a question that seemed purely hypothetical: could machines display the kind of flexible, general cognitive competence that is characteristic of human thought, such that they could pass themselves off as humans to unaware humans?

Three-quarters of a century later, the answer looks like ‘yes'. In March 2025, the large language model (LLM) GPT-4.5, developed by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, was judged by humans in a Turing test to be human 73% of the time — more often than actual humans were2. Moreover, readers even preferred literary texts generated by LLMs over those written by human experts3.

This is far from all. LLMs have achieved gold-medal performance at the International Mathematical Olympiad, collaborated with leading mathematicians to prove theorems4, generated scientific hypotheses that have been validated in experiments5, solved problems from PhD exams, assisted professional programmers in writing code, composed poetry and much more — including chatting 24/7 with hundreds of millions of people around the world. In other words, LLMs have shown many signs of the sort of broad, flexible cognitive competence that was Turing's focus — what we now call ‘general intelligence', although Turing did not use the term.

What is the future of intelligence? The answer could lie in the story of its evolution

What is the future of intelligence? The answer could lie in the story of its evolution

Yet many experts baulk at saying that current AI models display artificial general intelligence (AGI) — and some doubt that they ever will. A March 2025 survey by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in Washington DC found that 76% of leading researchers thought that scaling up current AI approaches would be ‘unlikely' or ‘very unlikely' to yield AGI (see go.nature.com/4smn16b).

What explains this disconnect? We suggest that the problem is part conceptual, because definitions of AGI are ambiguous and inconsistent; part emotional, because AGI raises fear of displacement and disruption; and part practical, as the term is entangled with commercial interests that can distort assessments. Precisely because AGI dominates public discourse, it is worth engaging with the concept in a more detached way: as a question about intelligence, rather than a pressing concern about social upheaval or an ever-postponed milestone in a business contract.

In writing this Comment, we approached this question from different perspectives — philosophy, machine learning, linguistics and cognitive science — and reached a consensus after extensive discussion. In what follows, we set out why we think that, once you clear away certain confusions, and strive to make fair comparisons and avoid anthropocentric biases, the conclusion is straightforward: by reasonable standards, including Turing's own, we have artificial systems that are generally intelligent. The long-standing problem of creating AGI has been solved. Recognizing this fact matters — for policy, for risk and for understanding the nature of mind and even the world itself.

We assume, as we think Turing would have done, that humans have general intelligence. Some think that general intelligence does not exist at all, even in humans. Although this view is coherent and philosophically interesting, we set it aside here as being too disconnected from most AI discourse. But having made this assumption, how should we characterize general intelligence?

A common informal definition of general intelligence, and the starting point of our discussions, is a system that can do almost all cognitive tasks that a human can do6,7. What tasks should be on that list engenders a lot of debate, but the phrase ‘a human' also conceals a crucial ambiguity. Does it mean a top human expert for each task? Then no individual qualifies — Marie Curie won Nobel prizes in chemistry and physics but was not an expert in number theory. Does it mean a composite human with competence across the board? This, too, seems a high bar — Albert Einstein revolutionized physics, but he couldn't speak Mandarin.

How close is AI to human-level intelligence?

How close is AI to human-level intelligence?

A definition that excludes essentially all humans is not a definition of general intelligence; it is about something else, perhaps ideal expertise or collective intelligence. Rather, general intelligence is about having sufficient breadth and depth of cognitive abilities, with ‘sufficient' anchored by paradigm cases. Breadth means abilities across multiple domains — mathematics, language, science, practical reasoning, creative tasks — in contrast to ‘narrow' intelligences, such as a calculator or a chess-playing program. Depth means strong performance within those domains, not merely superficial engagement.

Human general intelligence admits degrees and variation. Children, average adults and an acknowledged genius such as Einstein all have general intelligence of varying level and profile. Individual humans excel or fall short in different domains. The same flexibility should apply to artificial systems: we should ask whether they have the core cognitive abilities at levels comparable to human-level general intelligence.

Rather than stipulating a definition, we draw on both actual and hypothetical cases of general intelligence — from Einstein to aliens to oracles — to triangulate the contours of the concept and refine it more systematically. Our conclusion: insofar as individual humans have general intelligence, current LLMs do, too.

We can start by identifying four features that are not required for general intelligence.

Perfection. We don't expect a physicist to match Einstein's insights, or a biologist to replicate Charles Darwin's breakthroughs. Few, if any, humans have perfect depth even within specialist areas of competence. Human general intelligence does not require perfection; neither should AGI.

Universality. No individual human can do every cognitive task, and other species have abilities that exceed our own: an octopus can control its eight arms independently; many insects can see parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are invisible to humans. General intelligence does not require universal mastery of these skills; an AGI does not need perfect breadth.

Human similarity. Intelligence is a functional property that can be realized in different substrates — a point Turing embraced in 1950 by setting aside human biology1. Systems demonstrating general intelligence need not replicate human cognitive architecture or understand human cultural references. We would not demand these things of intelligent aliens; the same applies to machines.

Superintelligence. This is generally used to indicate any system that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in almost all areas. Superintelligence and AGI are often conflated, particularly in business contexts, in which ‘superintelligence' often signals economic disruption. No human meets this standard; it should not be a requirement for AGI, either.

What, then, is general intelligence? There is no ‘bright line' test for its presence — any exact threshold is inevitably arbitrary. This might frustrate those who want exact criteria, but the vagueness is a feature, not a bug. Concepts such as ‘life' and ‘health' resist sharp definition yet remain useful; we recognize paradigm cases without needing exact boundaries. Humans are paradigm examples of general intelligence; a pocket calculator lacks it, despite superhuman ability at calculations.

When we assess general intelligence or ability in other humans, we do not attempt to peer inside their heads to verify understanding — we infer it from behaviour, conversation and problem-solving. No single test is definitive, but evidence accumulates. The same applies to artificial systems.

Just as we assess human general intelligence through progressively demanding tests, from basic literacy to PhD examinations, we can consider a cascade of increasingly demanding evidence that warrants progressively higher confidence in the presence of AGI.

Turing-test level. Markers comparable to a basic school education: passing standard school exams, holding adequate conversations and performing simple reasoning. A decade ago, meeting these might have been widely accepted as sufficiently strong evidence for AGI.

Expert level. Here, the demands escalate: gold-medal performance at international competitions, solving problems on PhD exams across multiple fields, writing and debugging complex code, fluency in dozens of languages, useful frontier research assistance as well as competent creative and practical problem-solving, from essay writing to trip planning. These achievements exceed many depictions of AGI in science fiction. The sentient supercomputer HAL 9000, from director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, exhibited less breadth than current LLMs do. And current LLMs even exceed what we demand of humans: we credit individual people with general intelligence on the basis of much weaker evidence.

Superhuman level. Revolutionary scientific discoveries and consistent superiority over leading human experts across a range of domains. Such evidence would surely allow no reasonable debate about the presence of general intelligence in a machine — but it is not required evidence for its presence, because no human shows this.

Current LLMs already cover the first two levels. As LLMs tackle progressively more difficult problems, alternative explanations for their capabilities — for instance, that they are gigantic ‘lookup tables'8 that retrieve pre-computed answers or ‘stochastic parrots'9 that regurgitate shallow regularities without grasping meaning or structure — become increasingly disconfirmed.

Often, however, such claims just reappear with different predictions. Hypotheses that retreat before each new success, always predicting failure just beyond current achievements, are not compelling scientific theories, but a dogmatic commitment to perpetual scepticism.

AI language models killed the Turing test: do we even need a replacement?

AI language models killed the Turing test: do we even need a replacement?

We think the current evidence is clear. By inference to the best explanation — the same reasoning we use in attributing general intelligence to other people — we are observing AGI of a high degree. Machines such as those envisioned by Turing have arrived. Similar arguments have been made before10 (see also go.nature.com/49p6voq), and have engendered controversy and push-back. Our argument benefits from substantial advances and extra time. As of early 2026, the case for AGI is considerably more clear-cut.

We now examine ten common objections to the idea that current LLMs display general intelligence. Several of them echo objections that Turing himself considered in 1950. Each, we suggest, either conflates general intelligence with non-essential aspects of intelligence or applies standards that individual humans fail to meet.

They're just parrots. The stochastic parrot objection says that LLMs merely interpolate training data. They can only recombine patterns they've encountered, so they must fail on genuinely new problems, or ‘out-of-distribution generalization'. This echoes ‘Lady Lovelace's Objection', inspired by Ada Lovelace's 1843 remark and formulated by Turing as the claim that machines can “never do anything really new”1. Early LLMs certainly made mistakes on problems requiring reasoning and generalization beyond surface patterns in training data. But current LLMs can solve new, unpublished maths problems, perform near-optimal in-context statistical inference on scientific data11 and exhibit cross-domain transfer, in that training on code improves general reasoning across non-coding domains12. If critics demand revolutionary discoveries such as Einstein's relativity, they are setting the bar too high, because very few humans make such discoveries either. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that human intelligence is not itself a sophisticated version of a stochastic parrot. All intelligence, human or artificial, must extract structure from correlational data; the question is how deep the extraction goes.

They lack world models. LLMs supposedly lack representations of their physical environment that are necessary for genuine understanding. But having a world model requires only the ability to predict what would happen if circumstances differed — to answer counterfactual questions. Ask a cutting-edge LLM what differs between dropping a glass or a pillow on a tile floor, and it will correctly predict shattering in one case and not the other. The ability of LLMs to solve olympiad mathematics and physics problems and assist with engineering design suggests that they possess functional models of physical principles. By these standards, LLMs already have world models. Furthermore, neural networks developed for specialized domains such as autonomous driving are already learning predictive models of physical scenes that support counterfactual reasoning and sophisticated physical awareness13.

They understand only words. This objection centres on the fact that LLMs are trained only on text, and so must be fundamentally limited to text-based tasks. Frontier models are now trained on images and other multimodal data, making this objection somewhat obsolete. Moreover, language is humanity's most powerful tool for compressing and capturing knowledge about reality. LLMs can extract this compressed knowledge and apply it to distinctly non-linguistic tasks: helping researchers to design experiments — for example, suggesting what to test next in biology and materials science4 — goes beyond merely linguistic performance. We are yet to encounter the sharp limitations to LLM performance that this objection predicts.

They don't have bodies. Without embodiment, critics argue, there can be no general intelligence. This reflects an anthropocentric bias that seems to be wielded only against AI. People would ascribe intelligence to a disembodied alien communicating by radio, or to a brain sustained in a vat. An entity that responds accurately to any question, but never moves or acts physically, would be regarded as profoundly intelligent. Physicist Stephen Hawking interacted with the world almost entirely through text and synthesized speech, yet his physical limitations in no way diminished his intelligence. Motor capabilities are separable from general intelligence.

They lack agency. It is true that present-day LLMs do not form independent goals or initiate action unprompted, as humans do. Even ‘agentic' AI systems — such as frontier coding agents — typically act only when a user triggers a task, even if they can then automatically draft features and fix bugs. But intelligence does not require autonomy. Like the Oracle of Delphi — understood as a system that produces accurate answers only when queried — current LLMs need not initiate goals to count as intelligent. Humans typically have both general intelligence and autonomy, but we should not thereby conclude that one requires the other. Autonomy matters for moral responsibility, but it is not constitutive of intelligence.

6 weird groundhog facts for Groundhog Day

Groundhogs don't really forecast the weather, but there are plenty of other strange things about these rodents

By K. R. Callaway edited by Andrea Thompson

Groundhogs are unique, and it's not just because of their annual weather forecasts

Since at least 1886, a groundhog now named Punxsutawney Phil has emerged from his burrow every Groundhog Day to predict when winter weather will end. Other groundhogs (Marmota monax) around the country have joined him in this climatological soothsaying. Folklore, likely stemming from Celtic mid-season festivals, dictates that if Phil sees his shadow, winter will continue for six more weeks, whereas if he doesn't, spring will come early. (Many people around the country are probably hoping that shadow doesn't appear after recent winter weather.)

Of course, Phil's “forecasts” are actually no better than chance, but thousands, drawn by the allure of an unusual event for an unusual creature, still gather to see him emerge every February 2.

To celebrate these odd critters, here are six of the weirdest facts about groundhogs, one for each week of winter we might have left.

When groundhogs emerge this time of year, they are actually more interested in finding mates than making forecasts. The first ones to go aboveground are usually males that take a few days to mark their territory and gauge potential partners before they head back into their burrows for another month of hibernation.

Groundhogs' teeth never stop growing, so gnawing on things to keep them from getting too long is essential. The animals usually use their powerfully regenerative teeth to break off pieces of food, defend themselves and gather materials they might use to build their nests.

From the surface, a groundhog's burrow might just look like a hole in the ground, but inside, it can be elaborate. Burrows frequently have distinct chambers that act as bathrooms and bedrooms, multiple entrances and tunnels twisting through the earth that total as much as 65 feet in length.

As groundhogs dig deep to create their burrows, they have sometimes stumbled upon historical relics. In at least three cases, groundhogs have helped locate new archeological sites—including one of the oldest known sites of human habitation in North America: Pennsylvania's Meadowcroft Rockshelter.

Archeology isn't the only science groundhogs help us with—they also help medical researchers better understand the connection between hepatitis B (HBV) and liver cancer. Because the groundhog equivalent of HBV is so similar to that in humans, researchers can use them as a stand-in for people to better understand how HBV causes liver issues.

Groundhogs are conspicuous critters—the largest ground-dwelling rodent in the squirrel (Sciuridae) family—and are found throughout much of North America. Their ubiquity means lots of groups, including Indigenous Americans, have had a chance to name them. Besides “groundhog,” a few of the more common names include woodchuck and whistle-pig, referring to the “chuck” and “whistle” sounds they make or their stocky build.

CRISPR–Cas enzymes must recognize a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) to edit a genomic site, greatly limiting the range of targetable sequences in a genome. Although engineering strategies to alter PAM specificity exist, they typically require labor-intensive, iterative experimentation. We introduce an evolution-informed deep learning model, Protein2PAM, to efficiently guide the design of Cas protein variants tailored to recognize specific PAMs. Trained on a dataset of over 45,000 CRISPR–Cas PAMs, Protein2PAM rapidly and accurately predicts PAM specificity directly from Cas proteins across type I, II and V CRISPR–Cas systems. Using in silico mutagenesis, the model identifies residues critical for PAM recognition in Cas9 without using structural information. We use Protein2PAM to computationally evolve Nme1Cas9, generating variants with broadened PAM recognition and up to a 50-fold increase in PAM cleavage rates compared to the wild type in vitro. Our machine learning approach allows Cas enzymes to target sequences that were previously inaccessible because of PAM constraints, potentially increasing target flexibility in personalized genome editing.

Metrics details

CTNNB1, the gene encoding β-catenin, is a frequent target for oncogenic mutations activating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, typically through missense mutations within a degron hotspot motif in exon 3. Here, we combine saturation genome editing with a fluorescent reporter assay to quantify signaling phenotypes for all 342 possible missense mutations in the mutation hotspot. Our data define the genetic requirements for β-catenin degron function, refine the consensus motif for substrate recognition by β-TRCP and reveal diverse levels of signal activation among known driver mutations. Tumorigenesis in different human tissues involves selection for CTNNB1 mutations spanning distinct ranges of predicted activity. In hepatocellular carcinoma, mutation effect scores distinguish two tumor subclasses with different levels of β-catenin signaling, and weaker mutations predict greater immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. Our work provides a resource to understand mutational diversity within a pan-cancer mutation hotspot, with potential implications for targeted therapy.

The canonical Wnt pathway is essential for normal development and is erroneously activated in many cancers1. Its main intracellular effector, β-catenin (encoded by CTNNB1), is normally degraded by a destruction complex consisting of APC, AXIN2, CK1 and GSK3β. Wnt ligand binding or mutations that impair this complex lead to β-catenin accumulation, nuclear translocation and activation of T cell Factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF) transcription factor target genes (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) serves as a scaffold within the destruction complex. APC loss-of-function mutations activate β-catenin and are common in colorectal cancers, in which tumors often select for mutations with a ‘just-right' level of β-catenin signaling2,3,4,5.

Gain-of-function changes within the CTNNB1 exon 3 degron motif are among the most common mutations in several tumor types6,7. These mutations act in a dominant manner by disrupting the interaction between the phosphorylated DpSGXXpS motif (residues 32–37) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase receptor β-TRCP, preventing β-catenin ubiquitylation and degradation7. The phospho-regulatory cascade involves CK1 priming at S45, followed by GSK3β phosphorylation at T41, S37 and S33, enabling β-TRCP docking.

Mutations within exon 3 of CTNNB1 occur in 20–30% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)8,9. HCC has been classified into subtypes with distinct molecular and immune features10,11,12,13. The inflamed class is characterized by interferon signaling, enrichment of cytolytic T cells and M1 macrophages, whereas the non-inflamed class is largely devoid of immune infiltrate. β-catenin signaling and CTNNB1 mutations are associated with immune exclusion and promote resistance to immunotherapy in mouse models of HCC9,14,15,16. However, a substantial fraction of CTNNB1-mutant HCCs presents an inflamed phenotype (30%), highlighting the need for studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms14.

Previous studies have suggested that different CTNNB1 mutations can activate signaling to different degrees17,18,19. A small subset of exon 3 genotypes observed in human cancer has been directly compared using cellular assays; however, the functional impact of most variants remains unknown. Here, we develop a saturation genome editing (SGE) assay to systemically quantify the relative activity of all possible missense substitutions within the exon 3 hotspot, assigning functional scores to >80% of CTNNB1 missense mutations observed in cancer.

We analyzed 9,248 tumors with CTNNB1 mutations in the COSMIC database (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). As previously reported6, the majority of mutations (86%) were missense substitutions. Of these, 88% occurred in the L31–G48 hotspot region encoded by exon 3 (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). Residues T41 and S45 were most frequently affected, comprising 27% and 25% of hotspot missense mutations, respectively, followed by S37, S33, D32 and G34 (Supplementary Fig. 1b).

Data from other primary tissue sites are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. d, Schematic overview of the mutational scanning assay. A β-catenin signaling activity reporter construct was integrated randomly into the genome to generate transgenic mice23. Primary ES cells were derived, and a region spanning exons 2–6 of Ctnnb1 was replaced with a puro∆TK selection cassette on one of two alleles. A plasmid library was generated for homology-directed repair, encoding each of 342 possible single amino acid substitutions spanning codons 31 to 48 of β-catenin, together with silent mutations to allow selective PCR amplification of edited alleles from genomic DNA. This was transfected into multiplex-ready mouse ES cells together with sgRNAs that cut in an allele-specific manner on either side of the selection cassette. After recovery, transfected cells were cultured in the presence of FIAU to kill those in which the selection cassette had not been removed. Multiplex-ready cells were routinely cultured under 2i conditions51 to compensate for hemizygous CTNNB1 expression, but the GSK3β inhibitor (CHIR99021) was withdrawn 2 days before sorting to allow β-catenin signaling to return to a baseline state. Cells were then subject to fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on the level of GFP reporter expression, before extraction of genomic DNA, amplification of Ctnnb1 exon 3 by PCR and Illumina sequencing. Further methodological information is detailed in the Methods. e, The frequency of individual missense mutations across each position in the mutation hotspot in cell populations sorted according to the scheme shown in d, expressed relative to their frequency in the unsorted pool sample. The color scheme used to represent different missense mutations is shown to the right.

Source data

Analysis across tissues revealed tissue-specific mutation preferences (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). S45 mutations are greatly enriched in adrenal and kidney tumors, whereas mutations within the β-TCRP docking motif predominated in the central nervous system (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). Liver and skin showed a broader profile, encompassing all six of the most frequently mutated positions (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). Specific amino acid substitutions at each residue also varied by tissue. For example, 99% of soft tissue tumors with T41 mutations (1,201 out of 1,217) carried T41A, whereas in pituitary gland, 89% of T41 mutations (77 out of 87) were T41I (Supplementary Fig. 2). Overall, CTNNB1 hotspot mutational patterns are highly diverse and tissue-dependent.

To systematically measure the consequences of CTNNB1 hotspot mutations on β-catenin signaling, we devised a multiplexed CRISPR homology-directed repair (HDR) assay covering all 342 possible single amino acid substitutions across positions 31–48 (Fig. 1d). This assay enables phenotypic analysis of variants expressed from the endogenous mouse Ctnnb1 locus, which is 100% conserved with human exon 3 at the amino acid level. Variant function was measured in parallel under normal regulatory control20,21,22, providing a sensitive and comprehensive assessment of hotspot mutant phenotypes. A library of HDR templates was synthesized, each encoding a single amino acid substitution and flanking synonymous changes to enable selective PCR amplification of edited alleles20,21 (Fig. 1d).

To analyze individual hotspot mutations at the single-cell level, we derived embryonic stem (ES) cells from the Tcf/Lef-H2B–GFP transgenic mouse line23,24, then replaced exons 2–6 of Ctnnb1 with a negative counter-selection cassette on one allele (Fig. 1d). Specifically targeting and replacing the selection cassette with a multiplexed HDR template library, combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Supplementary Fig. 3a), enabled efficient quantification of the functional output of each edited allele (Fig. 1d). ES cells were chosen for their high HDR efficiency and intact canonical WNT signaling, in contrast to most tumor lines.

After editing and selection, a subset of cells displayed elevated Tcf/Lef-H2B–GFP reporter expression (Supplementary Fig. 3a), consistent with canonical Wnt pathway activation. Cells were sorted into six equally log-spaced bins (P1–P6) based on increasing reporter GFP signal (Supplementary Fig. 3a), and genomic DNA was subjected to amplicon deep sequencing across the Ctnnb1 hotspot region using primers specific for HDR-edited alleles (Fig. 1d). Amplicon sequencing was also performed on the untransfected HDR donor library (‘plasmid') and edited but unsorted cells (‘pool'; Supplementary Fig. 3b), enabling quantification of Ctnnb1 variant frequencies across reporter activity bins relative to their frequency in the total cell population (Fig. 1e). Normalized mutant allele frequencies showed high correlations between biological replicates (Pearson's r, range 0.54–0.89; Supplementary Fig. 3c) and were merged for downstream analysis. Frequencies also correlated well between plasmid and pool samples (Pearson's r, 0.63), indicating consistent and unbiased HDR efficiency throughout the targeted region (Supplementary Fig. 3c).

The mutation frequency was relatively constant across positions in the unsorted cell population (Supplementary Fig. 3b), whereas it varied substantially across cells with different GFP levels (Fig. 1e). Substitutions at codon positions that are frequently mutated in tumors (D32, S33, G34, S37, T41 and S45) were rarely observed in low activity bins but frequently observed in bins of higher activity (Fig. 1e), validating this system's ability to functionally classify CTNNB1 mutations.

For each variant, we calculated a mutational effect score (MES) by integrating allele frequencies and reporter activation levels across bins25 (Supplementary Methods). This procedure provided a metric to compare the phenotypic consequences of each substitution and gain insight into β-catenin regulation (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2).

Created in BioRender.com. c, Unsupervised clustering of Ctnnb-mutant clones based on global RNA-seq expression profiling shows co-clustering of clones with mutations of similar MES values (purple bar). d,e, Ten endogenous β-catenin target genes were selected based on the high correlation (>0.85) between transcript expression and dose of the GSK3β inhibitor CHIR99021 (d); transcript expression also correlated with MES values of the relevant exon 3 mutations (e). All r values and P values are from Pearson tests (two-sided); P values of <0.05 are highlighted in red.

Source data

We first compared the MES values with scores produced by 50 computational variant effect predictors (VEPs) for the same substitutions26 (Supplementary Table 3). The strongest correlation was observed for EVE, which uses deep generative models to calculate variant effect scores from evolutionary sequence information27. The correlation between EVE and MES scores for the CTNNB1 hotspot (Spearman's ρ, 0.662) was higher than any other EVE–deep mutational scanning (DMS) combination and all but three of 1,430 VEP–DMS comparisons in a prior benchmarking study26. Although correlation with VEP scores is not a definitive measure of DMS reliability, the strong concordance supports the high quality of the current dataset.

We next tested the ability of MES scores to predict endogenous β-catenin target activation. Using multiplex-ready ES cells, we generated 15 clonal cell lines (Fig. 2b), each heterozygous for one of 11 mutations spanning a range of MES values, focusing on substitutions at the three most frequently mutated positions in human cancer. Transcriptional responses were measured using bulk 3′ RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), with GSK3β inhibition by CHIR99021 serving as a positive control. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering classified cell lines into low, medium and high MES categories (Fig. 2c). Ten β-catenin targets that showed dose-responsive activation by CHIR99021 (Pearson r > 0.85; Fig. 2d) also displayed positive correlations between transcript levels and the relevant MES value (Fig. 2e; median Pearson r = 0.57; range, 0.02–0.87; P < 0.05 for seven out of ten target genes).

MES values also predicted endogenous β-catenin target gene expression in human fetal liver organoids. A previous study introduced one of four exon 3 mutations (D32G, S33F, T41A or S45P) homozygously at the endogenous CTNNB1 locus (Supplementary Fig. 4a)28. RNA-seq data from these organoids showed positive correlations between MES values and β-catenin target genes in nine out of ten cases (median Pearson r = 0.65; range, −0.5 to 0.96; Supplementary Fig. 4b). As outlined further below, MES scores also predicted the strength of β-catenin target activation in two independent human HCC cohorts. Altogether, these data show that MES values predict the degree to which endogenous β-catenin target genes are activated by different exon 3 mutations in both mouse ES cells and hepatocytes.

The current model of genotype–phenotype relationships within the exon 3 hotspot proposes that missense mutations exert position-dependent effects on β-catenin signaling: S45 mutations activate weakly, T41 mutations activate moderately and mutations within the core β-TRCP docking motif (positions 32–37) activate strongly19. Our derivation of MES values for all 19 possible missense mutations across the hotspot region enabled testing and refinement of this model. Notably, of the 342 possible amino acid changes, only 105 can arise by a single nucleotide substitution (median of six changes per site; Fig. 3a). As expected, this group accounts for >98% of the single amino acid substitutions in the COSMIC database (Supplementary Table 1).

Source data

Consistent with the current model, we found that S45 mutations generally produced weaker activation than mutations in the docking motif, both among single-nucleotide variants and across all substitutions (Fig. 3b). Nonetheless, MES values at the same position varied substantially (Fig. 3a,c). For example, S45T and T41S were well tolerated (Fig. 3c), reflecting the ability of CK1α and GSK3β to phosphorylate either serine or threonine29. Substitution of S45 for small amino acids (alanine, glycine) was also well tolerated (Fig. 2a). It has previously been reported that in-frame deletions at S45 still permit phosphorylation at T41, S37 and S33 in colon cancer cells30,31. Collectively, the data thus suggest that the absence of a large side chain at S45 enables β-catenin degron function without CK1α priming32.

Although the average effect of all T41 substitutions was intermediate, >98% in the COSMIC database are substitutions for alanine or isoleucine, which were the two strongest activating substitutions identified at this position. Both substitutions can be reached by one nucleotide change (Fig. 3c). This contrasts with S45, for which all eight strongest amino acid substitutions require at least two nucleotide changes (Fig. 3c). Therefore, strong activating S45 mutations are theoretically possible (for example, S45M, S45K) but are rarely observed in cancer, probably because they require at least two nucleotide changes.

Extending the current model19, our data show that T41A and T41I activate β-catenin more than many commonly observed docking-motif variants (for example, D32V, D32Y, D32H, S33P, G34R). Other mutations at T41 (T41N, T41P), which are rare but still recurrent in human cancer (Supplementary Table 1), elicit weaker activation in the lower range of S45 mutations. It is therefore evident that different substitutions at the same position can elicit markedly different effects on β-catenin signaling, refining our understanding of CTNNB1 mutational diversity.

I35 lies at the center of the docking motif, directly contacting β-TRCP, and is thought to require a hydrophobic amino acid side chain6,33. The I35 side chain projects into a cavity on the β-TRCP surface33 (Fig. 3d). MES values for I35 substitutions were broadly distributed (Figs. 2a and 3a) and negatively correlated with a hydrophobicity index at this position34 (Spearman ρ = −0.42; Fig. 3e). However, substitution of isoleucine for several polar amino acids (for example, threonine, asparagine, tyrosine) yielded low MES values (Fig. 2a), indicating that hydrophobicity is not essential. By screening 566 amino acid property indices35, we observed that the strongest correlations with I35 MES values were nearly all related to secondary structure propensities. A Spearman correlation of −0.79 was observed with the ‘normalized frequency of β-sheet' index36 (Fig. 3f). Although residue I35 does not form a β-sheet in any available crystal structure, its dihedral angles place it clearly in the β region of a Ramachandran plot.

To ask whether this secondary structure requirement extended to other β-TRCP docking sites, we analyzed 28 high-confidence β-TRCP-dependent degrons containing the ‘DSGX' motif37 (Supplementary Table 4). Position 4 residues in this motif (corresponding to I35 in β-catenin) were variable across substrates (Fig. 3g). Numerous substrates (eight out of 28) had position 4 amino acids that ranked in the 25% most disruptive on the hydrophobicity scale, whereas only one out of 28 featured in the same bracket of the β-sheet scale (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0248). Therefore, an extended backbone conformation, rather than side chain hydrophobicity, better explains the effects of I35 substitutions and potentially analogous positions in other β-TRCP docking motifs.

The frequency of CTNNB1 hotspot mutations varies across tumor types (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1), probably reflecting multiple contributing factors. Stem cells in different tissues experience different genotoxic insults, which affect overall mutational spectra38,39 as well as the probability that specific CTNNB1 missense mutations become available for selection. Alternatively, or in addition, different tissue environments might favor selection for missense mutations causing levels of activation that are optimal, or ‘just-right', for their spatio-temporal context2. The current data provide an opportunity to distinguish these possibilities.

Mutational probability, calculated from background nucleotide substitution rates, is a poor predictor of CTNNB1 mutation patterns in cancer40, suggesting a strong influence of selection. We computed ‘mutational likelihood scores' (MLSs) for each of 342 hotspot missense mutations, using the background rates of nucleotide substitution in HCC and endometrial carcinoma whole-exome sequencing data (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). These scores represent the probability of an amino acid substitution, given the dominant mutational biases seen genome-wide in coding sequences of CTNNB1-mutant tumors. MLS values correlated positively across tissues (Pearson r = 0.920 for all mutations, r = 0.655 for the single-nucleotide group; Fig. 4a) but did not predict observed mutation frequencies (Fig. 4b; negative binomial generalized linear model, no improvement over null model; PLRT = 0.77 and 0.60, respectively). Therefore, tissue-specific CTNNB1 mutation patterns cannot be explained solely by mutation rates.

Scores are shown for all 342 possible amino acid changes, colored according to the minimum number of nucleotide substitutions required. b, Relationship between the observed frequency of specific CTNNB1 hotspot amino acid substitutions in the COSMIC database and MLSs calculated from LIHC and UCEC exomes from TCGA (see Supplementary Fig. 5).

We next tested whether tumors arising in different tissues select for hotspot mutations that activate β-catenin signaling to different degrees. Mutations in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) endometrial carcinoma cohort (Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma, UCEC) were enriched for higher MES values (Mann–Whitney test, P = 2.2 × 10−5), whereas in TCGA HCC cohort (Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma, LIHC), mutations spanned a broader range (Fig. 4c). This difference persisted following adjustment for tissue-specific background rates of mutation within coding sequences (P = 3.2 × 10−5). Given that mutation bias does not explain the tissue-specific difference in observed mutation frequencies, we postulate that they arise through natural selection for different optimal β-catenin signaling2.

Even greater variation in MES values was observed in the larger COSMIC dataset (Supplementary Table 1) across CTNNB1-mutant tumors from diverse tissue origins (Fig. 4d; one-way ANOVA, P < 2 × 10−19). Using MES distributions, tissues could be categorized as favoring high-effect mutations (for example, central nervous system), low-effect mutations (for example, kidney) or a broad or bimodal distribution (Fig. 4c). Bimodal distributions, observed in tissues such as large intestine and liver, comprised a lower-effect group, with mutations at S45 and weaker mutations within the β-TRCP docking motif (for example, H36P, D32Y, S33P), and a higher-effect group containing S33, G34, S37 and T41 mutations. These distributions highlight the potential for phenotypic variation arising from different CTNNB1 mutations among tumors with the same site of origin.

To investigate how CTNNB1 mutation strength influences signaling and immune exclusion in human cancer, we focused on HCC, which shows frequent exon 3 mutations. Patients with single exon 3 missense mutations and available RNA-seq data in TCGA HCC cohort8 (n = 80) were initially stratified into low and high groups based solely on the MES value of their mutation (Supplementary Fig. 6a). However, copy number gains spanning CTNNB1 enhance signaling, especially for S45 mutant alleles19, so six patients with copy number gains spanning mutant alleles in the low MES group were reassigned (Supplementary Fig. 6b). This produced 53 patients predicted to have strong and 27 with predicted weak β-catenin pathway activation (Fig. 5a and Supplemental Fig. 6b). For patients in the weak group, 48% had mutations in the docking motif, compared to 77% of the strong group (P = 0.012; Fig. 5b)

a, Proportion of HCC samples from TCGA cohort with CTNNB1 missense or AXIN1 coding mutations (left). The CTNNB1 missense mutations are then further divided into three categories (right): strong and weak mutations within the exon 3 hotspot (Supplementary Fig. 6b) and mutations that occurred elsewhere in the gene (other). A total of 18 further samples fell into more than one category or had deletions within CTNNB1; therefore, they were excluded. TCGA sample IDs and classifications are listed in Supplementary Table 9. b, Stacked histograms show the frequency and proportion of CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations from TCGA HCC cohort classified as weak or strong that lie in the docking site for β-TRCP (positions 32–37) versus elsewhere in the mutation hotspot. P value shows Fisher's exact test (two-sided). c, Expression of n = 10 β-catenin target genes in HCC stratified by β-catenin pathway mutation status. For each gene, the median expression value was calculated across all samples in the indicated patient group, then expressed as a percentage of the median value for the same gene in the strong group (indicated by the dashed horizontal line at 100%). FPKM, fragments per kilobase per million. Solid horizontal lines show the median percentage value across all ten genes, boxes show the upper and lower quartiles and whiskers show the range. *P < 4 × 10−3, **P < 1 × 10−4 from negative binomial generalized linear model (two-sided), with Tukey's adjustment for a family of five estimates. Gene-level data are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7a. d, Heatmap representation of β-catenin pathway activation for TCGA HCC samples with exon 3 hotspot mutations separated into weak and strong categories. LGR5 and GLUL are individual HCC targets. ‘Hallmark' indicates a multi-gene score calculated across 42 genes known to be activated by the accumulation of β-catenin (Hallmark wnt_b-Catenin gene set, MSigDB). P values show one-tailed t-tests. e, Boxplots show Hallmark β-catenin target gene set activation in TCGA tumors with strong or weak mutations in the docking motif, compared to those with mutations at T41 or S45. Horizontal lines show the median value, boxes show the second and third quartiles and whiskers show the range. Samples with copy number gain spanning lower-effect mutations (n = 6) were excluded. Differences between groups were not significant in a one-way ANOVA (P = 0.098). f, Enrichment of Gene Ontology terms in transcripts ranked among the most upregulated in pairwise comparisons between strong and weak CTNNB1-mutant HCC samples from TCGA. Terms were selected from the full list shown in Supplementary Table 6. Normalized enrichment scores (NES) show enrichment scores normalized to the size of the gene set. P value estimation is based on an adaptive multi-level split Monte Carlo scheme, adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini–Hochberg correction. GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis. g, H&E tumor sections from TCGA were scored using an ordinal scale according to the level of inflammatory infiltrate from zero (no visible immune cells) to three (diffuse or nodular aggregates of immune cells), then scores were compared across patients based on β-catenin pathway mutation status. P value shows Fisher's exact test (two-way) for differences between weak and strong groups in the fraction of patients with an immune score of zero versus one or greater. Statistical analysis was not performed on other groups.

To assess the effects of other mutations in the β-catenin pathway, we compared transcript levels for ten liver β-catenin target genes in HCC tumors with hotspot missense mutations versus no CTNNB1 pathway mutation. We included missense mutations in CTNNB1 outside the hotspot region (‘other'; n = 19; Fig. 5a), including positions 335, 383 and 387, which disrupt interaction with the destruction complex subunit APC41, giving a total of 99 CTNNB1 missense mutation cases in the TCGA HCC cohort (n = 80 hotspot, n = 19 other). A further 10% of the cohort had coding mutations in AXIN1 (n = 36), another destruction complex subunit and known HCC driver8,42. The remainder of the cohort had no CTNNB1 or AXIN1 mutation (‘no mutation'; n = 217).

Tumors in either the weak or strong hotspot class showed markedly higher β-catenin target gene expression compared to the ‘no mutation' group (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7a). Tumors with ‘other' mutations in CTNNB1, or AXIN1 mutations, expressed these targets at levels comparable to the ‘no mutation' samples (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7a). Therefore, although AXIN1 and non-hotspot CTNNB1 mutations contribute to HCC development, their effects on β-catenin target gene expression differ from both weak and strong hotspot mutations16,42,43,44.

As predicted by our screen, β-catenin targets were expressed at significantly higher levels in tumors from the strong versus weak patient group (Fig. 5c,d and Supplementary Fig. 7a). This was observed across all ten liver target genes in the curated set (median 49% reduction in transcript levels for the weak group (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7a). Tumors with weak exon 3 mutations also displayed significantly lower expression scores for the Hallmark CTNNB1 target gene set from MSigDB (37% median reduction, P < 0.01; Fig. 5d). The same trend was confirmed in a second independent HCC cohort (Montironi cohort)14 (Supplementary Fig. 7b). β-catenin pathway activation in tumors with T41 mutations was comparable to that of strong β-TRCP docking motif variants, with both groups showing non-significant trends towards higher activation than tumors with the weak docking motif or S45 mutations (one-way ANOVA, P = 0.098; Fig. 5e). Overall, weak mutations still activated β-catenin targets, but at intermediate levels compared to strong mutations and non-mutated tumors (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7a).

Transcriptome-wide, genes upregulated in strong versus weak HCC samples were significantly enriched for the Gene Ontology term ‘canonical Wnt signaling pathway' as well as terms associated with proliferation and stem cell function (Fig. 5f, Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Notably, the telomerase subunit TERT was among the most significantly upregulated genes (Supplementary Table 5). TERT may be a direct transcriptional target of β-catenin regulation45, and activating mutations in the TERT promoter are among the most frequent HCC driver mutations8,46.

Genes upregulated in tumors with weak versus strong exon 3 mutations were significantly enriched for terms associated with immune cell infiltration (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Table 6). Given that β-catenin signaling activation is a major immune escape pathway in several tumor types, including HCC15,47, weaker pathway activation may permit greater immune engagement, with potential implications for patient stratification and targeted therapy15,48,49. Consistent with this idea, tumors with weak CTNNB1 mutations showed upregulation of canonical T cell transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 9) to levels similar to tumors lacking CTNNB1 mutations. In addition, histology confirmed more frequent immune cell infiltration in weak versus strong mutant tumors (65 vs 38% with a score of >1, Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0245; Fig. 5g). Altogether, CTNNB1 exon 3 hotspot MES scores derived from a cell-autonomous reporter assay predict not only β-catenin signaling strength in HCC, but also clinically relevant phenotypes associated with the tumor microenvironment (Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Fig. 9).

SGE enables genetic variants to be functionally assessed in their native chromosomal context using scalable, multiplexed assays. We developed an SGE screening assay to quantify the impact of all amino acid substitutions in the β-catenin degron on signaling activation, spanning a region that covers >80% of cancer-associated missense mutations. The data explain why particular CTNNB1 mutations are observed in cancer and others are not, despite disrupting residues known to be critical for degron function.

Our experimental design has three advantages over previous studies that have compared the phenotype of CTNNB1 mutations17,18,19. First, we tested the function of all 19 alternative amino acids at each position, providing a complete understanding of genotype–phenotype relationships. Second, variants were introduced by genome editing at the endogenous locus, avoiding artifacts associated with ectopic overexpression. Third, the function of each variant was evaluated in parallel, in the same population of primary stem cells with a normal functioning Wnt pathway, providing sensitivity to distinguish subtle phenotypic differences.

Previous studies introduced the concept that distinct CTNNB1 hotspot mutations activate the canonical Wnt pathway to varying degrees17,18,19. One study19 analyzed β-catenin target gene activation in benign and malignant liver tumors and proposed that signaling strength depends on mutation position: S45 mutations activate weakly, T41 mutations activate moderately and mutations within the docking site (32–37) activate strongly. Our dataset supports certain aspects of this model, including weaker activity of S45 variants, but also revealed that different substitutions at the same position can have markedly different effects on signaling (Fig. 3a,b). Small side chains at S45 are well tolerated, whereas amino acids at position I35 must support an extended β-sheet-like conformation (Fig. 3f), which is probably required for β-TRCP docking because the same requirement is observed at other β-TRCP-dependent degrons (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Table 4). Our data thus redefine the consensus motif for β-TRCP docking as DpSGβXpS, where β indicates any residue that supports an extended backbone conformation. At the adjacent position H36, proline is most disruptive (Fig. 2a), probably because of conformational rigidity, explaining why H36P is the only H36 mutation commonly observed in human cancer (Supplementary Table 1).

Our dataset enables functional interpretation for variants of unknown significance within the CTNNB1 hotspot (Supplementary Table 1) and supports reclassification of variants with known relevance in HCC. We find that common T41 mutations (T41A, T41I) are strong activators, with MES values exceeding the average of docking site mutants (Figs. 3c and 5e and Supplementary Fig. 6). Moreover, about 25% of docking motif mutations in HCC showed relatively low activation, comparable to S45 mutations, which we classify as weak (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 6). This nearly doubles the proportion of TCGA patients with weak CTNNB1 mutations.

On average, tumors driven by weak mutations express liver β-catenin target genes at ~50% levels relative to the strong group (Fig. 5c). Importantly, this group is also less likely to be immune-excluded (Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Fig. 9). We note the similarities between the weak group and the recently described β-catenin ‘immune-like' subtype14. Weakly activating exon 3 mutations could provide both a novel mechanism and biomarker for this patient group and help to guide strategies for personalized combination-based therapies.

Our COSMIC database analysis showed that tumors arising in different tissues harbor exon 3 mutations of different predicted strength (Fig. 4d). However, MES values were measured using a reporter gene in mouse ES cells. MES can predict endogenous β-catenin signaling outputs in mouse ES cells (Fig. 2d) and liver (Fig. 5c,d and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 7), and we expect that they will also have predictive power in other cell and tissue contexts. However, further work is required to show this empirically; other β-catenin-dependent tumor types in TCGA were not informative either because of low sample numbers (for example, adrenocortical carcinoma), low frequency of exon 3 mutant tumors (for example, colorectal adenocarcinoma, melanoma) or low diversity of MES values (for example, endometrial carcinoma).

The relationship between exon 3 mutations and signaling outputs in advanced tumors may not reflect earlier stages owing to epistatic effects of co-occurring mutations, together with environmental and metabolic changes that accompany tumor progression. This concern motivated us to conduct the SGE screen in non-transformed primary cells rather than a cancer cell line. We also leave open the possibility that MES values measured in mouse ES cells may lack physiological relevance in certain contexts; for example, where β-catenin is degraded by SCFFBXW11 rather than SCFβTRCP (ref. 50).

This work complied with all relevant ethical regulations. Animal work was approved by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol 03-12-017; principal investigator A.-K. Hadjantonakis). No human data were generated specifically for this study.

All guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed using the optimized CRISPR design webtool previously hosted by the Feng Zhang laboratory, Benchling (https://benchling.com) and Wellcome Sanger Institute Genome Editing (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/wge). The gRNAs were cloned into either pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (Addgene plasmid 48138) or pSpCas9(BB)-2A-mCherry52 and verified by Sanger sequencing.

A backbone vector (wild-type β-catenin vector) was generated by amplifying a 5.4 kb region of Ctnnb1 intron1–6 using primers 5′-GGTTGATACTACCTTGAGTACTC-3′ and 5′-GATTCACAGGGCTGCTAGTG-3′. The amplicon was cloned into the PCR4 TOPO vector using a TOPO TA cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Then, a Gibson cloning reaction was set up, including the wild-type β-catenin vector (amplified using primers 5′-GTGAGGCTTTCTTTGTTGGC-3′ and 5′-GTCAAAAGGCAGAATGAAAACAG-3′), PuroΔTKamplicon (5′-CTGTTTTCATTCTGCCTTTTGACCATAGAGCCCACCGCATCC-3′ and 5′-GCCAACAAAGAAAGCCTCACTACC GGGTAGGGGAGGCG-3′) and Gibson Assembly master mix (NEB) following the manufacturer's guidelines.

Mouse ES cells were derived from the TCF/Lef-H2B–GFP mouse line23 using published methods24. The cells were then co-transfected with the PuroΔTK targeting vector and Ctnnb1 sgRNAs 1–4 (5′-TCTGCCTTTTGACGGACATT-3′, 5′-CACCCTCCAGGGCTGCTGTG-3′, 5′-AAAGCCTCACAGGATCCACC-3′ and 5′-TGTTAGAGTTGGGCTAAGGC-3′) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. After Puromycin (1 µg ml−1) selection, individual clones were picked, grown and validated as heterozygously targeted by Sanger sequencing. Cells were then routinely maintained on gelatin-coated flasks in Knockout DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (GE Healthcare, HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 3 µM CHIR99021 (Axon Medchem), 1 µM PD0325901 (Axon Medchem) and leukemia inhibitory factor (hereafter referred to as R2i media).

A double-stranded DNA library was synthesized by Twist Biosciences, with each 200 bp fragment encoding a single distinct amino acid (n = 20 per site) spanning codons 31 to 48 of β-catenin. Each fragment was flanked by BbsI recognition sites for cloning and included synonymous mutations to enable specific amplification of HDR-edited alleles. Each fragment was then cloned individually into a β-catenin destination vector containing a 5.5 kb β-catenin intron1–6 sequence (5′-GGTTGATACTACCTTGAGTACTC-3′ and 5′-GATTCACAGGGCTGCTAGTG-3′) with two BbsI sites flanking the target region. After ligation, the reactions were transformed into Stbl3 competent cells and incubated overnight on a shaker at 37 °C. An equal volume of inoculum from each pool was then combined and used as a starter culture for a single maxiprep plasmid isolation of the pooled HDR template library (Qiagen Maxiprep kit).

TCF/Lef-H2B–GFP reporter cells with heterozygous PuroΔTK knockin at the endogenous Ctnnb1 locus were maintained in R2i media. A total of 200 × 106 cells were transfected with the pooled HDR template library and PuroΔTK sgRNAs 1–4 (spacer sequences: 5′-TGGGGATGCGGTGGGCTCTA-3′, 5′-CCACCGCATCCCCAGCATGC-3′, 5′-GCCTCCCCTACCCGGTAGTG-3′, 5′-GCCTCACTACCGGGTAGGGG-3′) in 26 six-well plates, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Small-molecule enhancer L755507 was used at a concentration of 5 µM. On day 3, R2i media was replaced with GMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (GE Healthcare, HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) and leukemia inhibitory factor, including FIAU at 0.2 µM to selectively kill cells that had not deleted the TK cassette. On day 5, a single-cell suspension was generated using trypsin, and the cells were sorted based on GFP intensity into six equally logged bins using BD FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences). In a parallel control condition, cells underwent an identical genome editing and selection procedure but were collected without flow sorting (the ‘pool' sample). The procedure above was repeated twice, starting with 200 × 106 cells in each case (400 × 106 cells total). Each set of cells went through the same editing, drug selection and flow sorting procedure described above and in Fig. 1d. The number of cells sorted from each bin is listed in Supplementary Table 7.

Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A first round of PCR was performed using a forward primer that annealed upstream of the homology arm (5′-GTGGACATCAGAGGACAACTTG-3′) and a reverse primer that annealed to a region containing the HDR-edited allele (5′-TGTCAACATCTTCTTCTTCGGGA-3′). The entire DNA sample was amplified in several 30-cycle reactions using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (NEB), then the amplicons were digested with DpnI (Thermo Scientific), gel-purified and pooled.

For library preparation for the Illumina sequencing platform, a second round of PCR was performed to incorporate Illumina-specific barcode, primer pad, linker and adaptors. The reactions were performed in triplicate for 14 cycles using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (NEB), then pooled and purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter).

The mouse embryonic feeder-free stem cell line E14IVtg2a (E14) was maintained on gelatin-coated flasks in GMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (GE Healthcare, HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) and leukemia inhibitory factor. E14 cells were targeted with the puroΔTK vector as described above for the Tcf/Lef-H2B–GFP reporter cells, then the puroΔTK cassette was replaced by HDR donor templates containing individual missense mutations at positions S37, T41 and S45, as shown in Fig. 1d. ES cell colonies were picked and expanded, and clonal lines with heterozygous knockin were identified by Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons.

Total RNA was isolated from approximately one million cells per sample using the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the generation of cDNA and the RNA-seq library, we adapted the mcSCRB-seq method53 using previously described modifications54, starting with 100 ng of total RNA per sample; Illumina paired-end sequencing of the library was then performed on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) following the manufacturer's instructions. After sequencing, Read 1 contained the cDNA information, and read 2 only contained the unique molecular identifier.

A Galaxy workflow consisting of the following tools was used to perform (reads to count) transcriptome analysis. Cutadapt (Galaxy version 4.0+galaxy1; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/lparsons/cutadapt/cutadapt/4.0+galaxy1) was first used to remove adapter sequences from fastq files. FastQC (Galaxy version 0.73+galaxy0; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/fastqc/fastqc/0.73+galaxy0) was then used to generate the Read Quality reports. UMI-tools extract (Galaxy version 1.1.2+galaxy2; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/umi_tools_extract/umi_tools_extract/1.1.2+galaxy2) was used to extract UMI from fastq files. Filter with SortMeRNA (Galaxy version 2.1b.6; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/rnateam/sortmerna/bg_sortmerna/2.1b.6) was used to filter reads for ribosomal RNAs in metatranscriptomic data. The reads from this filtered fastq files were aligned to mm10 build of mouse genome using RNA STAR the Gapped-read mapper for RNA-seq data (Galaxy version 2.7.8a+galaxy0; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/rgrnastar/rna_star/2.7.8a+galaxy0). UMI-tools deduplicate (Galaxy version 1.1.2+galaxy2; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/umi_tools_dedup/umi_tools_dedup/1.1.2+galaxy2) was used for deduplication of UMIs. MarkDuplicates (Galaxy version 2.18.2.3; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/picard/picard_MarkDuplicates/2.18.2.3) was used to examine aligned records in BAM datasets to locate and filter duplicate molecules. FeatureCounts (Galaxy version 2.0.1+galaxy2; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/featurecounts/featurecounts/2.0.1+galaxy2) was used to generate the counts from the alignment data in the BAM files. Bedtools BAM to BED converter (Galaxy version 2.30.0+galaxy1; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/bedtools/bedtools_bamtobed/2.30.0+galaxy1) was used to convert the alignment data from BAM to BED file format. Bedtools Genome Coverage (Galaxy version 2.30.0; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/bedtools/bedtools_genomecoveragebed/2.30.0) was used to record the genome coverage in bedgraph file format from the BED files with the alignment data. CONVERTER_bedgraph_to_bigwig (Galaxy version 1.0.1; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=CONVERTER_bedgraph_to_bigwig) was used to convert the bedgraph file to bigwig file format for upload and visualization of the expression data on the UCSC or IGV genome browser.

The ‘mm10 Full' reference genome was used for the entire workflow. The counts table was converted into counts per million for all samples before normalization to z-score values, which were then used to generate a heatmap using the pHeatmap package (v.1.0.12) in RStudio. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering resulted in three main clusters. Differential gene expression analysis was then performed between clusters using the DESeq2 (Galaxy version 2.11.40.8+galaxy0) pipeline, and a final heatmap was generated using the pHeatmap package (v.1.0.12) in RStudio, limited to the list of genes that were differentially expressed between the three clusters.

Targeted and genome-wide mutations were downloaded from https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/download, filtered by gene CTNNB1, from COSMIC release v.94 (28 May 2021). Mutations labeled ‘Substitution – Missense' were extracted, excluding one multiple nucleotide polymorphism (p.I35_H36delinsSN).

Adaptors were trimmed and paired ends merged with NGmerge (https://github.com/harvardinformatics/NGmerge) to produce single-end reads. Mean sequence quality (Phred) scores were high (>30) across all base positions targeted for mutagenesis, so low-quality reads were not filtered out. Single reads were then aligned with bwa mem (v.0.7.17)55 to the 162 bp CTNNB1 reference sequence. A set of reads with a single missense on-target mutation, and no other mutations, was generated. Reads that did not fully cover the region targeted for mutagenesis (58–111 bp) were excluded, as were alignments with insertions and deletions anywhere, no mutations in the target region, mutations only outside the target region, multiple mutations in the target region, synonymous mutations only or mutations resulting in a codon that was not in the repair template library. The remaining reads had precisely one missense mutation specified from the HDR template library.

Read counts were normalized within each of the six experimental bins and two control conditions by dividing the number of reads for each mutation by the total number of filtered reads in that bin, such that the sum of normalized counts for all mutations in the bin was equal to 1. To calculate enrichment values relative to the starting population, the normalized count for each mutation in each bin was then divided by the normalized count for the same mutation in cells that had undergone the same genome editing and selection procedure but had not undergone flow sorting based on GFP. Replicates had high Pearson correlation (0.54–0.89 across GFP bins; Supplementary Fig. 3), so reads were merged for downstream analysis. Plasmid and unselected pool codon frequencies had a Pearson correlation of 0.63. Lastly, each of the six normalized mutant allele frequencies was multiplied by the mean GFP fluorescence value for all cells in the corresponding bin, and then the six values were added together to yield the MES. We noted that a subset of mutant alleles (31 out of 342) was underrepresented in the donor plasmid pool (<0.028% of reads observed versus 0.28% expected), probably as a result of non-uniform growth or processing of bacterial cultures before template pooling. These mutations are marked as ‘lower confidence' in Supplementary Table 2. None of the lower confidence mutations were observed among patients in TCGA or Montironi HCC cohorts.

VEP scores were obtained for all β-catenin single amino acid substitutions spanning amino acids 31–48 from 50 different methods, using a published pipeline26. The Spearman correlations were then calculated between the outputs of each predictor and the MES values. Note that some predictors only output scores for missense variants possible by single nucleotide changes, meaning that the correlations were calculated from fewer mutations; however, this has been shown to have little effect on overall correlations or relative predictor rankings56.

To investigate amino acid properties potentially related to the effects of mutations at I35, we downloaded all 566 indices from the AAIndex database35,37. The Spearman correlation was calculated between the values for each amino acid and the MES for each of the 19 substitutions at I35. These correlations are provided in Supplementary Table 8. Peptide sequences for previously reported βTrCP-dependent degrons were extracted from Table S1 of a previous publication37, then filtered for a precise match to the DSGX motif spanning positions 32–35 of β-catenin (n = 28 peptides, detailed in Supplementary Table 4).

Samples from TCGA-LIHC cohort (n = 370) were filtered into one of six groups (Supplementary Table 9): (1) ‘strong': those with a hotspot missense mutation with a MES value of >18,000 or MES < 18,000 plus copy number gain defined in cBioportal (n = 53); (2) ‘weak': those with a hotspot missense mutation with a MES value of <18,000 and no copy number gain (n = 27); (3) ‘other': those with a CTNNB1 missense mutation outside the hotspot region (n = 19); (4) ‘AXIN1': those with any coding mutation in AXIN1 (n = 36); (5) ‘no mutation': those without any coding mutation in CTNNB1 or AXIN1 (n = 217); and (6) ‘exclude': those with deletions and/or complex mutations in CTNNB1, those falling into more than one of groups (1) to (4) and those lacking survival and/or RNA-seq data (n = 18). Group (6) was excluded from further analysis.

For the Montironi cohort, we considered only patients with single missense mutations in the exon 3 hotspot (n = 44). Of those, 31 had mutations classified as strong based on the same classification system described above, including n = 2 with MES < 18,000 plus copy number gain, and 13 had mutations classified as weak.

Whole-slide images of haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (‘diagnostic slide') of TCGA-LIHC cohort were viewed using the NCI GDC Data Portal slide viewer; cases for which only a frozen section image (‘tissue slide') was available were not evaluated. Each case was scored by an expert consultant liver histopathologist and National Liver Pathology External Quality Assurance scheme member working at the national liver transplant center (T.K.), blinded to all new experimental data and without accessing any additional TCGA data. Intratumoral inflammation was scored using H&E morphology alone using a four-point ordinal scale57: 0, no inflammation; 1, scattered inflammatory cells; 2, focal aggregates of inflammatory cells; and 3, diffuse or nodular aggregates of inflammatory cells.

To compare transcriptomes of HCC samples from the categories shown in Fig. 5b, STAR transcript quantification for TCGA HCC samples (n = 361) was downloaded from the GDC Data Portal. Differential expression of samples in each category compared to the weak MES missense mutation was calculated with DeSeq2 (v.1.34)58 using shrunken log-fold changes. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the functional enrichment of the differentially expressed genes identified from RNA-seq data. The ranked list of differentially expressed genes was generated based on the DESeq2 statistics, which takes into account both fold-change and P value information. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed on the Gene Ontology database, which consists of three structured, controlled vocabularies. The enrichment analysis was carried out using the ClusterProfiler (v.4.6.2) package in R (v.4.2.0), using the ‘gseGO' function with default parameters59. The full output of this analysis is shown in Supplementary Table 6. For the analysis of β-catenin target genes, ten known targets (based on published literature) were identified among the 50 most upregulated transcripts in strong versus no mutation tumor groups from TCGA HCC dataset. We modeled expression as predicted by gene identity, HCC subgroup and their interaction using negative binomial models (R package MASS). We then obtained P values comparing expression in each HCC subgroup to ‘strong' as the baseline using marginal means testing implemented in the R package emmeans.

RNA-seq data from the Montironi cohort were generated and processed as previously described14. Hallmark expression scores were generated using the Wnt β-catenin Hallmark signature, using the ssGSEA pipeline implemented in Genepattern60,61. For human liver organoid data, normalized RNA-seq counts (fragments per kilobase per million) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (Accession ID GSE236490). Expression values were averaged for n = 2 biological replicates corresponding to each mutation.

Exome sequence variants from TCGA-LIHC (n = 375) and TCGA-UCEC (n = 404) were downloaded from the GDC Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov). Variants called by at least two of the four provided workflows (MuSE, MuTect2, SomaticSniper, VarScan2) were retained. Cases with one or more missense mutations in the 31–48 amino acid target region were extracted (TCGA-LIHC, n = 82; TCGA-UCEC, n = 104), and the single-nucleotide polymorphisms from these were used to generate tri-nucleotide mutation frequencies with SomaticSignatures62. The results shown are based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network (https://www.cancer.gov/tcga).

All possible mutational paths from one codon to another, one nucleotide change at a time, were generated for all codon pairs. The MLS of each path was calculated as \({\prod }_{i}{(\rm{freq}}_{i})\), where \({\rm{freq}}_{i}\) is the tri-nucleotide context mutational frequency of the \({i}^{\rm{th}}\) step of the path. The MLS of each codon change in every possible tri-nucleotide context is the sum of all paths between the two codons; similarly, the MLS for each amino acid change in its tri-nucleotide context is the sum of its codon change scores. A worked example is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5b, and MLS scores calculated separately from TCGA-LIHC and TCGA-UCEC are listed in Supplementary Table 11. For statistical testing, we modeled observed mutation frequencies as the result of MLS in the same tumor type, using a negative binomial generalized linear model implemented in the R package MASS. We compared these fits to null models fitting only the mean using likelihood ratio tests.

Statistical tests were performed in R (v.4.2.2) using RStudio (v.2022.12.0). All tests were two-sided unless stated otherwise. Sample size for the SGE screen was determined by the number of possible missense mutations between positions 31 and 48 of β-catenin, and all 342 variants were included. Sample sizes for clinical studies were determined by the number of patient samples available in relevant cohorts that could be unambiguously assigned to one category based on CTNNB1 pathway mutation status. No blinding or randomization was performed.

Biomolecular condensates have key roles in regulating cellular processes. Yet, the relationship between atomic features and condensate function remains poorly understood. We studied this relationship using the polar organizing protein Z (PopZ). Here, we revealed hierarchical assembly of PopZ into a filamentous condensate by integrating cryo-electron tomography, biochemistry, single-molecule techniques and molecular dynamics simulations. The PopZ helical domain drives filamentation and condensation, while the disordered region inhibits them. Phase-dependent conformational changes prevent interfilament contacts in the dilute phase and expose client-binding sites in the dense phase. Perturbing filament formation in vitro alters the dynamics of scaffold and client proteins and the condensate's wetting behavior. In cells, perturbing either filament formation or the ability of filaments to condense impairs PopZ function and leads to growth phenotypes. These findings establish a multiscale framework linking molecular interactions and condensate ultrastructure to cellular function.

Biomolecular condensates are nonstoichiometric assemblies of macromolecules that concentrate specific components while excluding others1,2,3. Their formation is driven by multivalent interactions implemented through intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), repeated oligomerization motifs or nucleic acid chains4,5. These dynamic assemblies are pervasive across biology, serving as a fundamental mechanism of cellular organization and mediating an array of cellular functions, including transcription regulation6, signal transduction7 and protein quality control8,9. They orchestrate cellular processes through the function of individual molecules within the condensate, as well as through the properties of the condensate itself10,11,12. These emergent properties—arising from the collective behavior of many molecules—include viscoelasticity13, surface tension14 and electrochemical potential15. Despite their importance, it remains a major challenge to link condensate-level properties to the molecular-level features from which they originate.

A particularly understudied question is how condensate function relates to its internal structure4,16. By internal structure, we refer to stable structures on the molecular and supramolecular level, larger than single molecules but smaller than the condensate itself. A notable supramolecular structure that has been observed for several condensates across different cellular pathways is the filament17. Unlike cytoskeletal filaments, which are long and designed for mechanical stability18, these condensate-associated filaments are typically short and flexible. The prevalence of filamentous condensates is illustrated by systems such as p62/SQSTM1 (hereafter p62)19, DAXX/SPOP20 and F-actin21, underscoring how useful a detailed characterization of this class of condensates could be.

To determine whether and how filamentation impacts condensate properties and function, it is essential to examine the individual and collective behavior of macromolecules across all relevant length scales—from molecular to filament to condensate level—in both dispersed and condensed states. Here, we elucidated the structure–function relationship of a condensate using in vivo and in vitro techniques, including cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), biochemical assays, single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and computational simulations.

The polar organizing protein Z (PopZ)22,23,24, a conserved protein within α-proteobacteria25, has a crucial role in cytosol organization. First identified in Caulobacter crescentus26,27,28, a well-studied model system for asymmetric cell division, PopZ forms condensates at the ends (poles) of the cell. These condensates selectively recruit cell-cycle-regulated proteins, establishing signaling gradients essential for driving asymmetric cell division29. Deletion of the popZ gene in C. crescentus results in abnormal cell division, disrupted chromosome segregation and loss of cellular asymmetry23,24. Furthermore, aberrations in the condensate's material properties (too fluid or too solid) lead to severe growth defects30. Beyond its role in C. crescentus, PopZ forms condensates across various systems, including in vitro, multiple bacterial species and human cells; it is also amenable to genetic engineering30.

In this study, we used an integrative approach to decode the structural and chemical determinants of PopZ condensate formation. We uncovered a hierarchical pathway in which PopZ assembles into trimers, hexamers, filaments and condensates. We characterized the conformational dynamics of individual PopZ molecules in both dilute and dense phases and observed phase-dependent conformational changes. Notably, the domain responsible for client binding in the dense phase also inhibits condensation in the dilute phase. Lastly, we perturbed specific steps in the assembly pathway to study the relationship between PopZ filaments and the properties of the resulting condensates. Our studies indicate that filamentation promotes condensate sphericity and slows down movements of PopZ and its clients in vitro and is tightly linked to PopZ function in vivo. While other filamentous condensates rely on separate proteins for filament formation, capping and crosslinking, PopZ integrates all three functions into a single 77-residue helical domain at its C terminus. Our work establishes a mechanistic analysis framework to understand how molecular-level features propagate across length scales and establishes a foundation for characterizing key attributes of filamentous condensates.

To investigate the supramolecular structure of PopZ within condensates, we purified recombinant wild-type (WT) PopZ, triggered condensation by adding 50 mM MgCl2 and visualized the resulting condensates by cryo-ET (Fig. 1a and Table 1). PopZ condensates were composed of filaments (Fig. 1a, middle). We quantified filament properties by segmenting tomograms with the software DragonFly (Comet Technologies)31 and tracing individual filaments using Amira (Thermo Fisher) (Supplementary Video 1). Filament lengths followed an exponential distribution (R2 = 0.99) with median and mean lengths of 34 nm and 38 nm, respectively (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Data 1). This distribution indicates isodesmic polymerization, a noncooperative filament formation where the association constant of building blocks is independent of filament length. In isodesmic polymers, there are no distinct nucleation and elongation phases, as the bonds between building blocks are identical and the affinity between them does not depend on their position within the filament32,33. Therefore, characterizing the PopZ filament reduces to identifying its building blocks and the bonds connecting them.

Scale bar, 10 nm. Additional reconstructions and representative filament images are shown in Extended Data Fig. 2a.

Source data

To investigate the relationship between filamentation and condensation, we analyzed cryo-ET tomograms of WT PopZ in the dilute phase (regions without condensates; Extended Data Fig. 1a). In the dilute phase, we observed fewer and shorter filaments, along with numerous speckles, which likely correspond to PopZ hexamers. These observations confirm that the increased concentration in the dense phase promotes filamentation (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d).

To confirm that WT PopZ forms filaments in vivo, we vitrified C. crescentus cells expressing mCherry-tagged WT PopZ and used cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling to create lamellae thinner than 200 nm. This reduction in specimen thickness, combined with high-magnification cryo-ET, yielded a detailed visualization of C. crescentus cells. We observed the previously described PopZ microdomains at the cell poles, which were devoid of large macromolecules, such as ribosomes (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Within microdomains, we identified filamentous structures consistent with WT PopZ filaments we observed in vitro and in agreement with findings by Toro-Nahuelpan et al., who visualized PopZ filaments in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense and C. crescentus34. Taken together, our structural characterization reveals that the underlying substructure of the PopZ condensate in vivo and in vitro consists of a meshwork of interwoven filaments, which themselves have a broad length distribution.

To characterize the driving forces of PopZ condensation, we screened different salt and pH conditions for their ability to trigger droplet formation. Divalent cations such as MgCl2 at physiological concentrations (2–5 mM) are sufficient for condensation, with higher concentrations accelerating assembly30. Low pH (<6.0) or increased concentrations of salt (>300 mM NaCl) also promote condensation (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We tested three buffering agents—sodium phosphate, HEPES and Tris-HCl—all of which supported droplet formation. PopZ formed smaller droplets in Tris-HCl buffer and occasionally formed nonspherical, aggregate-like clusters in a buffer lacking salt and divalent cations (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Using a physiologically relevant buffer with lower magnesium concentration and a crowding agent (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 with 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 5% PEG), we observed robust droplet formation.

PopZ's modular structure includes a C-terminal helical OD necessary for condensation29,35,36, a negatively charged, proline-rich IDR that imparts fluidity to the condensates30 and an N-terminal helical region (H1) that recruits binding partners into the microdomain37,38 (Fig. 2a,b). We reasoned that conditions promoting condensation screen repulsive interactions driven by the IDR. We previously showed that the length and charge distribution of the IDR affect the material properties of PopZ condensates in vivo30, indicating that the IDR influences condensate function. To test whether the IDR also affects its formation, we engineered a tobacco etch virus (TEV)-cleavable construct (H1–IDR–TEV–OD). Before cleavage, this construct mirrored WT PopZ's behavior, forming droplets only under condensing conditions. TEV cleavage separated the IDR from the OD, resulting in droplets made up entirely of OD and supernatant containing H1–IDR (Fig. 2c). Fluorescent labeling confirmed that OD droplets excluded the H1–IDR (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2c). Thus, when covalently attached to the OD, H1–IDR inhibits condensation through a mechanism that can be overcome using low pH, addition of divalent cations or high salt concentrations (more information in the Supplementary Text).

a, Schematic of the PopZ construct. The construct includes an N-terminal 6×His fusion (brown) fused to PopZ from C. crescentus, which codes for a short helical N-terminal region, H1 (pink box), a 78-aa IDR (gray curly line) and a C-terminal region comprising three predicted helices: H2, H3 and H4 (blue boxes). Positions −20 and 132 (indicated by asterisks) were used to covalently attach fluorescent dyes for imaging and smFRET studies. b, AlphaFold 3 model of the PopZ monomer shown for illustrative purposes. A TEV cleavage site, introduced between residues 99 and 100, is present in our PopZ construct only when specified. c,d, TEV cleavage separates the H1–IDR region from the OD, leading the OD to condense and H1–IDR to be excluded from the condensates. c, Representative SDS–PAGE gel with Coomassie staining. TEV protease was added to TEV-cleavable PopZ in vitro and incubated for 1 h before pelleting down the dense phase (2,000g, 3 min). MW, molecular weight; P, pellet fraction, which contains the OD; SN, supernatant, which contains the IDR. The IDR migrates as a larger species because of its stretches of densely packed negative charges. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results. d, Phase and fluorescence images 30 min after incubation with TEV protease. The formed droplets (phase) are composed of cleaved OD (OD–AF488) and exclude cleaved H1–IDR (H1–IDR–AF647). Experiments were repeated twice with similar results. Scale bars, 5 µm. e, OD condensates are made up of filaments. Left, representative cryo-ET tomogram of 5 µM H1–IDR–TEV–OD cleaved for 3 min with TEV protease in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA and 2 mM DTT. Magnification: ×53,000. A total of three tomograms were recorded (Extended Data Fig. 3). The purple box indicates a zoomed-in region of the condensate. Scale bar, 100 nm. Right, a 3D rendering of filaments of the segmented tomograms.

Source data

To determine whether condensates formed by isolated OD are also composed of filaments, we inspected them using cryo-ET. Without MgCl2, these OD condensates exhibited an internal structure resembling that of WT PopZ condensates (Fig. 2e), indicating that the OD alone is sufficient for filament formation. When we analyzed the length distribution of OD filaments, we found that it closely matched that of WT PopZ, with both median and average lengths only 3–5 nm shorter (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Because this difference is smaller than the size of the building block itself, as discussed later, we conclude that the IDR has minimal influence on filament length.

The mechanism of condensation through interactions between structured filaments and their inhibition through an IDR remains largely underexplored, although similar mechanisms have been documented in a few systems17,19,21,39 (Discussion). Indeed, current phase-separation predictors did not capture PopZ's ability to condense (Supplementary Data 2). Thus, there is a need for predictors that can account for condensation driven by mechanisms involving polymerization, as used by PopZ.

To study the assembly pathway leading to PopZ filaments, we used mass photometry40,41, where WT PopZ at 250 nM concentrations adopted trimers and hexamers (Fig. 3a, gray). Buffer conditions and salt concentrations modulate the populations of these oligomers but both species were consistently present (Supplementary Data 3). The addition of 50 mM MgCl2 promoted the formation of higher-order oligomers such as 12-mers and 18-mers (Fig. 3a, middle), suggesting that PopZ forms filaments by stacking hexamers before condensation. Consistent with this interpretation, low pH and increased salt concentrations also promoted hexamer stacking (Supplementary Data 3). These conditions likely screen the repulsive negative charges of the IDR and thereby allow ODs of different hexamers to approach each other and interact.

To further elucidate the determinants of oligomeric assembly, we examined two PopZ variants shown to disrupt oligomerization in native gel electrophoresis and multiangle light scattering35: P146A and Δ172–177 (hereafter referred to as ΔL6, indicating the deletion of the last six residues). At 250 nM, P146A formed only trimers, whereas ΔL6 assembled exclusively into hexamers (Fig. 3a). Addition of MgCl2 did not induce higher-order oligomerization in either variant (Supplementary Data 3). Surprisingly, using light microscopy, we observed that both variants still formed condensates, albeit at higher saturation concentration (csat) than the WT, approximately 2 µM for P146A and 20 µM for ΔL6 versus ~0.5 µM for WT PopZ (Extended Data Table 1). We, therefore, studied the relationship between filamentation and condensate formation.

Mass photometry is unsuitable for monitoring oligomerization at micromolar concentrations, as it can no longer distinguish between a single large particle and two smaller particles landing close to each other. To study the oligomerization of dispersed PopZ in the micromolar range, we used analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC)42. AUC revealed distinct oligomerization patterns for P146A, ΔL6 and WT PopZ (Fig. 3b). WT PopZ (gray) formed the largest species, which we attributed to filaments of varying lengths. P146A (magenta) also formed higher-order oligomers, albeit smaller ones than WT PopZ, while ΔL6 (tan) did not exceed a sedimentation coefficient of 3, consistent with hexamers. Unexpectedly, WT PopZ populated a single species with a large s value rather than a distribution similar to that observed within the condensate by cryo-ET (Fig. 1b). This may result from higher concentrations required for AUC (100 µM) compared to cryo-ET and physiological conditions (5 µM), possibly leading to the formation of supramolecular clusters that limit filament growth. Because all three variants could form condensates, these data suggest that either filamentation is not strictly required for condensation or that ΔL6 requires magnesium, salt or low pH to form filaments.

To determine whether ΔL6-PopZ condensates are made up of filaments, we determined their ultrastructure using cryo-ET. Unlike WT PopZ and OD, ΔL6-PopZ condensates were composed of discrete hexamers (Fig. 3c), indicating that L6 is required for stacking the hexamers into filaments. This suggests that, while ΔL6-PopZ can condense without forming filaments, the reduced multivalency of hexamers compared to filaments likely causes the observed increase in csat.

The absence of filaments also impacted the condensate shape. The tendency of a liquid to minimize its surface area by forming a sphere is related to its surface tension14,43. WT PopZ droplets (Fig. 1a) appeared spherical with clear boundaries, indicative of high surface tension. In contrast, ΔL6 droplets had irregular boundaries and were deformed upon contact with the glass surface, displaying enhanced wetting behavior (Fig. 3d; comparison of WT, OD and ΔL6 in Extended Data Fig. 3). These observations indicate that loss of filamentation drastically affected surface tension.

Viscosity, another biologically important material property, relates to the diffusivity of molecules within condensates, which is often probed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)44. To test whether filamentation affects the diffusivity of PopZ, we incubated fluorescently labeled PopZ with WT, ΔL6 or a mix of both and performed FRAP (fitting details in Supplementary Data 4). In WT PopZ condensates (that is, filaments), recovery was negligible after 20 min. Adding hexameric ΔL6 enabled partial recovery, with a 40% mobile fraction and a 27-min half-time. This effect was amplified in ΔL6-only condensates, which had a 90% mobile fraction and 10-min recovery half-time (Fig. 3e, top right). Thus, PopZ diffuses more freely in hexamer-based condensates than in filamentous ones. These results provide a structural basis for emergent properties of the condensate.

Next, we addressed whether filament loss affects the diffusivity of condensate clients, defined as components that partition into and reside within preformed condensates45. In C. crescentus, PopZ interacts with clients through its H1 (refs. 37,46), which is distant in sequence from the OD and the last six residues. We examined the recruitment of the client ChpT47, an essential mediator within C. crescentus's cell-cycle circuit that directly binds to PopZ29. ChpT labeled with AF488 showed recovery after photobleaching in WT, mixed and ΔL6 droplets (Fig. 3f, bottom right). Recovery kinetics required a two-phase model, combining diffusion and binding/unbinding dynamics between ChpT and PopZ. Increasing the hexamer fraction (and, thus, decreasing the filament fraction) again sped up recovery and increased the mobile fraction (Supplementary Data 4). These results indicate that filamentous WT slows down ChpT movement to a greater extent than hexameric ΔL6-PopZ. In summary, the last six residues (172–177) enabled filament formation, which impacted the material properties of the condensate. Because WT PopZ can form filaments without condensing and ΔL6-PopZ can condense without forming filaments, we conclude that filamentation and condensation, while strongly coupled, are two distinct processes governed by different residues or driving forces.

Above, we found that PopZ forms trimers, hexamers and filaments. A structural description of these oligomeric states and how they interact to form condensates would provide deeper insights into PopZ biology and allow targeted sequence modifications for engineering purposes. To identify the determinants of PopZ oligomerization, we combined mass photometry and mutagenesis with structural models computed by AlphaFold 3 (ref. 48). AlphaFold 3 predicted that the trimeric form of PopZ features a hydrophobic core formed by a coiled coil of three H3H4 helices (residues 135–177) and stabilized by the hydrophobic effect (Extended Data Fig. 4a; summary of all structural models in Supplementary Data 5). This core remained stable when we included the H2 helix (residues 102–128) and the flexible linker connecting H2 to H3H4 (residues 129–135, which we refer to as ‘the loop'). In these predictions, the three H2 helices adopted variable orientations relative to H3H4, likely because of the flexibility of the loop connecting these segments (Extended Data Fig. 4b). To validate these predictions, we destabilized the putative hydrophobic core by substituting W151 and L152 (highlighted in Extended Data Fig. 4a,b) to glycine and serine, respectively, in the background of the P146A variant. During purification, this construct was prone to aggregation and mass photometry confirmed that it existed primarily as a monomer (Fig. 3a, right, OD* in blue), confirming that W151 and L152 are crucial for the stability of the trimer. We hypothesized that the trimeric core is a conserved feature across PopZ orthologs in α-proteobacteria. Using AlphaFold 2 (ref. 49), we predicted the structures of PopZ trimers from orthologs spanning hundreds of species across α-proteobacteria. In all cases, the predicted structures closely resembled the trimeric coiled coil of C. crescentus PopZ (Extended Data Fig. 4a), suggesting that it is a central feature of PopZ.

To characterize PopZ hexamers, we combined AlphaFold 3 structural models with experimental validation. We tested the models through mutagenesis and mass photometry to determine oligomeric states and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques, including subtomogram averaging and single-particle cryo-EM two-dimensional (2D) class averages, to resolve the hexamer shape and dimensions.

To pinpoint the minimal hexamer-forming segment, we designed a construct (H1–IDR–TEV–OD-ΔL6) missing the last six residues and separated H1–IDR from OD-ΔL6 after TEV cleavage (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Isolated OD-ΔL6 (residues 102–171) remained soluble at concentrations below 5 µM but formed droplets at higher concentrations, with mass photometry confirming hexamer formation (Extended Data Fig. 4d), indicating that neither L6 nor H1–IDR is necessary for hexamer assembly. Mass photometry of ΔH2-PopZ (lacking residues 102–128) revealed trimer and hexamer populations comparable to those of full-length PopZ (FL-PopZ) (Fig. 3a, right, gray and green), indicating H2 is also dispensable for hexamer formation. Lastly, mass photometry of Δloop-PopZ (lacking residues 129–134) showed a complete shift of the population to trimers (Fig. 3a, right, light gray), indicating that the loop connecting H2 to H3H4 is essential for hexamer formation (summary of sequence determinants in Fig. 6a). Thus, we identified residues 129–171 as the core hexamer-forming segment.

To define the hexamer shape and dimensions, we performed subtomogram averaging on hexameric ΔL6-PopZ. It resolved two predominant hexamer shapes: a straight one, measuring 100 Å in length, and a curved one, extending to 130 Å (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Disordered segments cannot usually be resolved in cryo-ET because of conformational variability, meaning the resolved shapes represent the structured OD. Modeling the hexamer-forming segment with AlphaFold 3 predicted head-to-head interactions between trimers mediated by the loop and H3 helices, with C termini projecting outward (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Comparing the hexamer and trimer models also suggests that H3H4 helices can slide with respect to each other (Extended Data Fig. 6a, bottom). Additional support for the AlphaFold 3 model came from single-particle cryo-EM 2D class averages of ΔH2ΔL6-PopZ (Extended Data Fig. 6b), although the complex's inherent flexibility limited high-resolution structural determination.

Including H2 in AlphaFold 3 yielded an S-shaped model with H2 bundles replacing H3 contacts, compatible with the curved 2D classes obtained in subtomogram averaging of ΔL6-PopZ (Extended Data Fig. 6c and Supplementary Data 1). Together, these results indicate that H3H4 helices form trimers that interact through the loop to assemble hexamers approximately 100–130 Å in length. Furthermore, the model suggests that the hydrophobic H2 helices project outward from the hexamer center, potentially forming interoligomer contacts with H2 bundles from other PopZ particles.

To gain high-resolution insights into WT PopZ filaments, we used subtomogram averaging on the segmented WT PopZ filaments. This approach proved challenging because of the heterogeneity and pronounced curvature of the filaments (Fig. 1a, bottom). To address this, we focused our analysis on a subset of straight filaments, which we isolated using a segmentation-based particle picking method. The class averages revealed that the filaments have the same width as individual hexamers, suggesting that filaments are formed through the longitudinal stacking of hexameric subunits (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Given that H2 is not required for hexamer formation (Fig. 3a), we explored its potential role in filament assembly. AUC showed that ΔH2-PopZ did not sediment beyond a coefficient of approximately 3, indicating that it remained hexameric, similar to ΔL6-PopZ (Extended Data Fig. 4d). This finding suggests that H2 contributes to filamentation either directly or indirectly.

To identify the specific residues within H2 involved in filament formation, we generated partial truncations of H2, deleting either residues 102–109 or residues 110–122. Surprisingly, neither construct restored filamentation (Extended Data Fig. 4e, coral and magenta), indicating that the entire H2 is necessary for this process. Therefore, both the H2 region and the last six residues are required for filamentation, either because they directly participate in the filament-forming interactions or because they enable PopZ to adopt a conformation needed for filamentation. The terminal position of the last six residues makes them more likely to facilitate the longitudinal stacking of hexamers, while the central position of H2 suggests it may stabilize a filament-favoring conformation. Taken together, our data indicate that PopZ filaments form through longitudinal stacking of hexamers, can bend considerably and require both the H2 region and the last six residues for proper assembly.

Condensation requires intermolecular interactions to become thermodynamically favorable over intramolecular interactions and solvent interactions50. Because PopZ forms supramolecular assemblies (that is, oligomers and filaments), the term intermolecular can be ambiguous. Therefore, we use the term interoligomer contacts to describe interactions between distinct PopZ particles, whether they are hexamers or filaments. To identify the regions responsible for interoligomer contacts, we performed a series of deletions along the PopZ sequence and assessed their impact on droplet formation using light microscopy.

Deleting the last six residues abolished filament formation and significantly increased csat (Extended Data Table 1), likely because of reducing multivalency rather than compromising interoligomer contacts. Similarly, deletion of the loop increased csat. In contrast, deleting the H2 region (102–128) completely prevented condensation in our standard buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM MgCl2), even at high protein concentration (100 µM). While ΔH2-PopZ formed droplets at elevated salt or magnesium concentrations (Extended Data Table 1), these droplets dissolved within ~20 min, suggesting that H2 stabilizes interoligomer contacts critical for condensation. Furthermore, partial deletion of H2 (Δ102–109 and Δ110–122) did not restore condensation, possibly because of destabilization of the H2 helix, suggesting that H2 promotes condensation not only through specific residues but also by maintaining its helical structure. In summary, while deletions within the OD that disrupt oligomerization or filamentation also increased csat, the removal of H2 precluded condensation under standard conditions altogether.

As an orthogonal approach to identify the contacts between trimers, hexamers and/or filaments that drive condensation, we conducted coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations51,52 of PopZ self-assembly (Methods). We validated our model by comparing the simulated propensity of PopZ to undergo phase separation across several solution conditions and mutations, showing qualitative agreement with our experimental data (Extended Data Fig. 5c). While we primarily focus on the condensation of trimers, hexamer simulations gave similar results (Extended Data Fig. 5d). To better understand the molecular interactions that drive condensation, we examined the intertrimer contact map of WT PopZ during cluster formation induced by 600 mM monovalent salt (Extended Data Fig. 5e). We identified interaction hotspots involving residues within H2, the middle of the H3H4 helix and the loop connecting these regions. Thus, the simulations indicate that H2 and H3H4 drive trimer–trimer interactions. It is likely that similar interactions among trimers, hexamers and/or filaments drive condensation in vivo.

To experimentally validate these computational predictions, we created a library of PopZ mutants, altering in the range of 2–11 residues predicted to be solvent accessible and interaction prone according to AlphaFold 3 and our MD simulations. We substituted these residues either from sticky to inert (for example, arginine to alanine) or from sticky to repulsive (for example, arginine to glutamic acid) (Extended Data Fig. 7a; details in Methods). We assessed the ability of these mutants to form condensates in Escherichia coli (Extended Data Fig. 7c), finding that condensation could be disrupted by mutations in either H2 or H3H4 alone. We purified four of these constructs and confirmed by mass photometry that they could still form trimers and hexamers, suggesting that their structural integrity was preserved (Extended Data Fig. 7d). In vitro, three of four constructs retained the ability to form condensates, although their csat was increased by an order of magnitude. These results suggest that condensation does not depend exclusively on any single residue or module; rather, an ensemble of sticky residues is distributed across the H2, loop and H3H4 regions. Each of these residues contributes to lowering csat and collectively they promote condensation.

In summary, both experimental and computational data suggest that interoligomer contacts are formed by multiple residues across H2, the loop and H3H4.

We showed above that the H1–IDR segment inhibits OD condensation unless divalent cations, high salt or low pH are present (Fig. 2d). To investigate this mechanism, we monitored the proximity of the N terminus to the OD using smFRET53,54. We labeled the same cysteine positions as in Fig. 2d (C−20 and C132) within the same molecule and verified that labeling did not disrupt oligomer or condensate formation (Extended Data Fig. 8a). For smFRET experiments, we supplemented this PopZ FRET reporter (at ~300 pM) with a 16,667-fold excess of unlabeled WT PopZ (5 µM) to prevent formation of oligomers with more than one FRET reporter, which could lead to artifacts in FRET parameters.

With 151 disordered residues between the two dyes, we expected a low FRET efficiency (EFRET < 0.1) on the basis of mean distance predictions of 91 Å for a random chain55 and >100 Å for the actual sequence according to ALBATROSS, a deep learning algorithm56,57. We indeed observed a population at low EFRET ~ 0.1 (Fig. 4a). However, we also observed an intermediate EFRET state (mean EFRET > 0.5, average interdye distance of ~54 Å), suggesting that the N terminus and the OD can come much closer to one another than expected in the absence of intra-PopZ interactions. Photon distribution analysis (PDA)58 showed that 67% of PopZ molecules adopt the compacted state (intermediate EFRET). Denaturing and weakening PopZ intermolecular interactions with 6 M Gdn-HCl significantly reduced the population of the compacted state, confirming an interaction (Fig. 4b, right, tan).

a, smFRET reveals that PopZ adopts extended and compacted conformations in the dilute phase. FRET efficiency distribution of the smFRET reporter labeled at C−20 and C132 shows two predominant conformations in the dilute phase (light gray): extended and compacted. The extended conformation coincides with the predicted behavior of a random coil (dark gray), whereas the compacted conformation indicates proximity between the N and C termini. b, H1 drives the compacted conformation. Left, schematic illustrating two experimental conditions. Top, in the first condition, labeled FL-PopZ was mixed with an excess of unlabeled WT PopZ. For each labeled PopZ monomer (fluorophores indicated by green and red circles), two unlabeled PopZ monomers are shown, where the H1 of the unlabeled monomer competes with the H1 of the labeled monomer for a binding site on the OD (excess WT). Bottom, in the second condition, labeled FL-PopZ was mixed with an excess of unlabeled ΔH1-PopZ (missing residues 1–23). In this case, only H1 of the labeled PopZ monomer can bind the OD (excess ΔH1). Right, FRET efficiency plot shows that excess WT promotes the extended conformation (gray), similar to the denaturing condition (tan). In contrast, excess ΔH1-PopZ promotes the compacted conformation (blue). Error bars in the inset represent 95% confidence interval estimated by a Jacobian in PDAFit (nWT = 3,955 bursts; nGdn-HCl = 1,203 bursts; nΔH1 = 3,158 bursts). c, ChpT does not interact with PopZ in the dilute phase. Left, FRET efficiency histograms indicate that ChpT at 5 µM (tan) only marginally increased the population of the extended conformation of PopZ (gray). Right, mass photometry and sedimentation coefficient distribution from AUC for individual samples of PopZ (gray) and ChpT (magenta), as well as combined samples (tan). The combination did not indicate the formation of a new PopZ:ChpT species. Error bars in the inset represent 95% confidence interval estimated by a Jacobian in PDAFit (nWT = 3,955 bursts; nChpT = 3,162 bursts). d, H1 recruits ChpT to PopZ condensates. Fluorescence microscopy images show 1 nM ChpT labeled with AF488 recruited by FL-PopZ condensates (top), whereas ChpT remains diffuse in the presence of condensates of isolated OD (bottom).

Bottom left, the 2D histograms of FRET efficiency versus burst duration. Durations greater than 15 ms (turquoise box) were selected to isolate fluorescence bursts coming from within condensates.

In the dilute phase, H1 is predominantly bound to the OD, preventing ChpT (green) from interacting with H1. In the dense phase, H1 is released from the OD, enabling ChpT binding.

Source data

Because H1 is the only structured element in the N terminus, we hypothesized that H1 binds the OD directly. If so, H1 from both the labeled FRET reporter and the unlabeled PopZ would compete for the OD. To reduce such competition, we supplemented the FRET reporter with unlabeled ΔH1-PopZ instead of unlabeled WT (Fig. 4b, left). Under these conditions, the population of the compacted state rose significantly, confirming that H1 is responsible for bringing the N terminus into proximity of the OD (Fig. 4b, right, blue).

This interaction is also predicted by AlphaFold 3, although the predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) and overall model scores are low (Extended Data Fig. 8b).

Given that H1 is responsible for client binding, we expected clients such as ChpT to stabilize the extended state of PopZ. Surprisingly, adding 5 µM ChpT had little effect on the extended population (Fig. 4c) despite this being a csat according to previous studies of the ChpT–PopZ interaction29,37. These two studies, however, may have altered PopZ behavior; Lasker et al.29 immobilized PopZ on an SPR surface, possibly affecting its fold and oligomerization, while Holmes et al.37 removed the OD to make PopZ amenable for NMR, thereby eliminating the compacted state entirely. To test whether ChpT binds to dispersed PopZ with orthogonal techniques that do not compromise its structural integrity, we turned to mass photometry and AUC at physiological and supraphysiological concentrations. Neither technique revealed any detectable ChpT binding to dispersed PopZ (Fig. 4c, right). In contrast, condensed PopZ robustly recruited AF488-labeled ChpT (Fig. 4d), even at 100-fold lower concentrations. Recruitment was lost in droplets of isolated OD where H1 is absent. These results suggest condensation substantially enhances ChpT–PopZ interactions.

To rationalize the lack of robust ChpT–PopZ interactions in the dilute phase, we hypothesized that the H1–OD interactions in the dilute phase prevent H1–ChpT interactions, whereas condensation suppresses these interactions, enabling client recruitment. To test this, we repeated the smFRET experiment on condensed WT PopZ by adding 50 mM MgCl2. The addition of magnesium led to a drastic increase in the observed burst durations (the time a labeled molecule spends in the detection volume) compared to dispersed PopZ (Fig. 4e, top left). We plotted the duration of fluorescence bursts versus EFRET to select only bursts belonging to slow-moving species (that is, droplets; Fig. 4e, bottom left). The plot shows that condensation shifted the entire population to the extended state, where H1 and OD are far from each other (Fig. 4e, right). Together, these findings support a model where, in the dilute phase, H1 interacts with the OD, serving as a competitive inhibitor of ChpT binding, while condensation relieves this inhibition, allowing ChpT recruitment. We note that, even though one third of the dispersed population featured an extended H1, ChpT was unable to bind PopZ until it condensed, suggesting that even the extended H1 fraction in dispersed PopZ may not be as accessible as H1 within condensates. This mechanism combines avidity with a condensation-dependent conformational switch (Fig. 4f).

Our model implies that removing H1 would promote the extended state and might allow condensation without divalent cations, salt or low pH. However, purified ΔH1-PopZ did not form spherical droplets. Instead, addition of magnesium led to aggregate-like clusters (Extended Data Fig. 8c, left), similar to those at low pH without salt or magnesium. In AUC, ΔH1-PopZ formed nonnative species that grew much larger than WT PopZ (Extended Data Fig. 8c, right). We propose that, without the tethering of H1 to the OD, PopZ can get trapped in aggregation-prone intermediates. The IDR likely has an important role in the formation of these intermediates, as isolated OD, which lacks both H1 and the IDR, is well behaved in vitro (Fig. 2).

To assess the role of PopZ filamentation in vivo, we expressed filament-deficient mutants in C. crescentus cells. Replacing WT PopZ, which forms polar foci, with hexameric PopZ (ΔL6-PopZ) led to a uniform cytoplasmic distribution of PopZ35, indicating that filaments are important for condensation by increasing multivalency, consistent with our in vitro findings. To determine whether filamentation confers functional benefits, we expressed low levels of mCherry–ΔL6-PopZ in otherwise WT cells, mimicking our in vitro mixing experiments (Fig. 3e,f, blue FRAP curves). Even at low expression (Methods), mCherry–ΔL6-PopZ was toxic, completely inhibiting cell growth (Fig. 5a).

At the start of the cell cycle, ParB forms a complex with the parS centromere that is anchored to the PopZ condensate at the old pole. During chromosome replication, one copy of the ParB:parS complex remains anchored at the old pole through ParB interactions, while the other copy migrates to the new pole, associating with PopZ with assistance from a ParA gradient to facilitate rapid migration61,62. c, The effect of PopZ mutants on DNA segregation.

The cells express mCherry–PopZ variants from a plasmid, while CFP–ParB (blue) replaces WT ParB to track DNA segregation. Checkmarks or crosses indicate whether chromosome segregation proceeded properly, that is, whether ParB foci were anchored and the old pole, replicated, migrated to the new pole and were captured at the new pole within expected time frames.

Scale bar, 1 µm.

Source data

To investigate this toxicity, we monitored DNA segregation using the ParABS partitioning system59,60 (Fig. 5b). Labeling the centromere-binding protein ParB with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) allowed us to track its motion throughout the cell cycle as a probe for PopZ's ability to anchor and capture ParB foci. Low-level expression of mCherry–WT PopZ alongside native PopZ did not disrupt ParB anchoring at the old pole, migration or capture at the new pole. In contrast, low expression levels of mCherry–ΔL6-PopZ caused severe phenotypes, localizing partially at the pole and dispersed throughout the cytosol (Fig. 5c). We also observed increased dynamics, frequently exchanging between the pole and cytosol and impaired the ability to capture and anchor ParB:parS complexes at the poles (kymographs in Fig. 5c).

To assess whether the observed aberrations in ParB:parS anchoring were because of impaired PopZ structure at the pole, its presence in the cytosol or both, we examined two additional mutants: Δ133–177, lacking the H3H4 region and incapable of condensation and polar localization, and ΔH1Δ133–177, which is unable to bind clients (Fig. 5c). While Δ133–177 drastically slowed down ParB motions, deletion of H1 restored normal function, suggesting that cytoplasmic PopZ that is unable to interact with clients is not harmful. However, when we deleted H1 from ΔL6-PopZ, cells were still unable to anchor or capture ParB:parS foci, indicating that ΔL6-PopZ impairs in vivo function by interfering with the WT PopZ condensate rather than through aberrant client interactions. In summary, our results indicate that filamentation is crucial for the function of PopZ condensates in vivo, not merely by enhancing multivalency but by maintaining condensate integrity essential for proper DNA segregation.

In the first section, we showed that condensation promotes filamentation and, here, we demonstrated that filamentation is required for PopZ's biological function. We next asked whether PopZ filaments must reside within condensates to carry out their function or whether dispersed filaments are sufficient. Therefore, we searched within our mutant library of PopZ variants with reduced stickiness (Extended Data Fig. 7) for mutants that form filaments but fail to condense. We used cryo-ET on the mutants named Loki and Ganesha to assess whether they form filaments. Both mutants successfully formed filaments; however, at physiological PopZ concentration (5 µM), only Loki formed condensates (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b), which resembled the WT. With these and other constructs in hand, we next asked whether reducing condensation in favor of dilute-phase filaments could recover PopZ function in ΔpopZ Caulobacter cells (Extended Data Fig. 9c).

In Caulobacter, dispersed PopZ is distributed throughout the cytoplasm, whereas condensed PopZ forms distinct polar foci. Deletion of popZ results in pronounced cell elongation and abnormal morphology22,23. Therefore, to evaluate the condensate-forming capability of constructs from our mutant library, we expressed each variant from an inducible promoter in ΔpopZ cells for 4 h. We then measured polar enrichment as a proxy for condensation (Extended Data Fig. 9d, left) and cell length as an indicator of restored function (Extended Data Fig. 9d, middle). We observed a clear inverse correlation between polar enrichment (condensation) and cell length (functional rescue), indicating that reduced condensation compromises the biological activity of PopZ filaments (Extended Data Fig. 9d, right). Taken together, these data make a case that neither condensates made up of speckles (for example, ΔL6-PopZ) nor dispersed filaments (for example, construct Ganesha) fully support PopZ's biological function. Rather, this function requires condensates made up of filaments.

The objective of this study was to characterize the relationship between the primary sequence of PopZ and its supramolecular assembly into condensates. We found that PopZ monomers form hexamers through trimerization mediated by helices H3 and H4, followed by head-to-head dimerization of trimers involving loop and helix residues, giving rise to a structure with outwardly directed C termini. The IDR and H1 helices extend from this core, modulating condensation by creating electrostatic repulsion that prevents premature interoligomer contacts. Upon charge neutralization, this repulsion is relieved, promoting filamentation and enabling condensation. Polymerization greatly enhances multivalency, while condensation further promotes polymer assembly through increased local concentrations, thereby defining the condensate's ultrastructural and physical properties, including increased viscosity and surface tension. A more detailed discussion of these findings is provided in the Supplementary Text and Table 1.

(v) A larger segment of the tomogram (yellow) with fitted hexamers, illustrating variability in filament lengths. Unused portions of the tomogram are outlined in black. Here, only the OD of each hexamer is displayed. (vi) Portion of a tomogram of the PopZ condensate (from Fig. 1) revealing the filamentous ultrastructure of the condensate. A scale bar is shown for each circle. c, Phase-dependent interoligomer contacts. Left, trimer and hexamer interactions in the dilute phase, with the gray ellipse representing a cloud of negative charge because of negatively charged residues and the flexibility of the IDR. Right, in the dense phase, conformational changes opening the H1 helices remove the IDR cloud around hexamers, enabling interfilament contacts.

The hierarchical and modular nature of PopZ condensation parallels other filament-driven systems such as p62, F-actin and SPOP/DAXX, highlighting common principles such as regulated polymerization, length control and multivalent crosslinking. Interestingly, PopZ filaments exhibit an intrinsic regulatory mechanism that allows condensate formation independent of external cellular factors, as demonstrated by the self-contained interplay between filament length, density and client recruitment. In α-proteobacteria, the evolutionarily tunable IDR tail provides an elegant means to regulate condensate properties crucial for cellular fitness, including viscosity for client retention and surface tension for compartmental integrity. These findings suggest broader principles for filament-driven condensates, emphasizing intrinsic polymerization control as a versatile strategy across biological systems.

E. coli MG1655 strain was grown in M9G liquid medium supplemented with kanamycin (5 µg ml−1). Overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in the same medium until they reached log phase (optical density at 600 nm (OD600) ≈ 0.5) at which point they were pelleted and resuspended to an OD600 of 0.12 in LB supplemented with kanamycin and with 0.02% arabinose to induce expression of PopZ variants from a pBAD vector. After 1 h of induction, bacteria were transferred to a pad of M9 with 1.2% agarose and 0.02% arabinose and imaged.

Caulobacter strains were grown at 30 °C in peptone yeast extract (PYE) or M2G liquid medium supplemented with kanamycin (5 µg ml−1). When indicated, cells were synchronized as follows63. First, 30 ml of bacteria in log phase were pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of cold M2, pelleted again and resuspended in 900 µl of M2 and 900 µl of Percoll (Cytiva). They were then pelleted for 20 min at 15,000g and 4 °C to separate swarmer and stalked cells. Swarmer cells were transferred into M2 and washed three times. Finally, the bacteria were resuspended in PYE and diluted to an OD of 0.12 and transferred to a pad of PYE and 1.2% agarose. Expression of PopZ variants was induced indirectly through the leaky expression from PYE medium35.

PopZ was expressed and purified from E. coli strain BL21. Cells were grown in 0.5 L of Luria–Bertani medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg ml−1) to an OD of 0.4 at 37 °C and then switched to an induction temperature of 18 °C for 20 min before induction. PopZ expression was induced overnight with 0.1 mM IPTG. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C.

The entire purification was conducted under denaturing conditions of 8 M urea to prevent aggregation and condensation of PopZ. The frozen cell pellet was resuspended in approximately 100 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 8 M urea, 20 mM imidazole and one tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Pierce) for every 50 ml of lysis buffer. Cells were lysed by sonication and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 30 min at 12 °C. The supernatant was injected onto a 5-ml HisTrap FF (Cytiva) using an AKTA Go system (Cytiva). The supernatant was reinjected once. PopZ was eluted through a step gradient of imidazole. The eluted PopZ was diluted fourfold in ion-exchange buffer A, containing 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl and 8 M urea. The diluted sample was then loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap Q FF (Cytiva) ion-exchange column and eluted with a salt gradient. The purified protein was flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C. It was buffer-exchanged into the desired buffer immediately before experiments. Purity of PopZ variants was assessed using SDS–PAGE and mass spectrometry.

First, 50–200 µl of 10-nm gold fiducials (Aurion) were spun down in a benchtop centrifuge for 20 min at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was removed and the beads were washed twice with standard buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM MgCl2). They were then resuspended in an appropriate amount of buffer, resulting in a 12.5–20% higher bead concentration than the original gold fiducial concentration. Quantifoil R 2/1 copper 200-mesh grids were glow-discharged with a Pelco easiGlow (Ted Pella, 25 s of glow at 15 mA). Then, 2.3 µl of gold fiducial beads were deposited onto the grid. The beads were given 30 s to spread out. Next, 4 µl of the PopZ sample was deposited onto the grid, backblotted and plunged into a mixture of propane and ethane using either a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 2.5 s of blot time, 0 s of wait time, 0.5 s of drain time and blot force of 0) at 22 °C, 90% humidity or a homemade gravity-driven plunging device. We used 2 µM as the PopZ concentration to obtain droplets that were small enough to fit into the field of view. After freezing, the vitrified grids were clipped with autogrids (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The ΔpopZ C. crescentus strain expressing mCherry–WT PopZ through a pXMCS-2 plasmid was grown at 30 °C in PYE supplemented with kanamycin until an OD600 of 0.2– 0.5 and then diluted 100-fold and grown until an OD600 of 0.3. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in PYE to an OD600 of 3. Next, 5 µl of the sample was deposited on glow-discharged (Pelco easiGlow; 25 s of glow at 15 mA) Quantifoil R 2/1 copper 200-mesh grids. The grids were then backblotted for 7–12 s before plunge freezing with a Vitrobot Mark IV into a mixture of 37% propane and ethane. After freezing, the vitrified grids were clipped with autogrids.

C. crescentus samples were subjected to cryo-FIB milling to reduce sample thickness and increase image contrast. Cryo-FIB milling was performed using the Aquilos 2 dual-beam cryo-FIB–scanning EM instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sample was sputtered with metallic platinum for 15 s, followed by a layer of organometallic platinum for 40 s, and then sputtered again with metallic platinum for 15 s. The metallic platinum helps to reduce charging and drifting while milling and the organometallic platinum helps to protect the sample from the FIB. Targeted regions on the grid were milled to produce lamellae with a thickness of approximately 150–200 nm. Finally, the grid was sputtered with metallic platinum for 15–20 s. The final sputter coat adds bead-like fiducial inclusions that are used for tilt-series alignment.

Both in vitro PopZ samples and cryo-lamellae of Caulobacter samples were imaged with a Titan Krios 300-keV microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a field-emission gun, a direct detection device (Gatan K3) and an energy filter (operated with a slit width of 20 eV). The SerialEM64 package with PACEtomo65 scripts was used to collect image stacks at tilt angles ranging from +51° to −51° (3° increment) using a dose-symmetric scheme with a cumulative dose of ~106 e− per Å2. Images were taken at a magnification resulting in 1.663 Å per pixel and a nominal defocus of −6 to −5 µm. Image stacks containing ~10 frames were motion-corrected with MotionCor2 (ref. 66) and assembled and aligned by IMOD64. All tomograms used in the figures were denoised with CryoCARE67 followed by Isonet68.

For in vitro PopZ data, 4× binned tomograms were imported into EMAN2 (ref. 69). Straight segments of PopZ filaments were selected using a segmentation-based particle picking function. Particle positions were translated into the IMOD coordinate system to be imported into the i3 (ref. 70) subtomogram averaging software. Before averaging, the contrast transfer function (CTF) of tilted images was estimated using gCTF71, CTF correction was performed using the IMOD ctfphaseflip function and CTF-corrected tomograms were created using IMOD. An initial reference was created by manually picking ~100 straight segments of filaments with predefined orientations using Tomopick72 software and averaging them using i3. Using this initial reference, the remaining particles were aligned and classified.

For dense-phase characterization, denoised in vitro PopZ tomograms were segmented using the deep learning tool in Dragonfly (Comet Technologies)31. For dilute-phase characterization, undenoised tomograms were segmented. The 2D UNet models were trained on hand-segmented frames of the tomogram. The model was applied to the entire tomogram and significant false positives were manually removed from the three-dimensional (3D) renderings. The island removal feature in Dragonfly was used to eliminate independent densities smaller than the size of a PopZ hexamer, thereby reducing noise from the segmentation results.

In vitro PopZ segmentations were used in Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for filament tracing. The following parameters for cylinder correlation were derived from measurements of PopZ filaments in IMOD: cylinder length, 100; angular sampling, 5; mask cylinder radius, 30; outer cylinder radius, 27; inner cylinder radius, 0. Filaments shorter than 250 Å were excluded because filaments shorter than 250 Å tend to be fragmented parts of longer filaments. The parameters used for the trace correlation lines were as follows: minimum seed correlation, 50; minimum continuation, 100; direction coefficient, 0.4; minimum distance, 75; minimum length, 250; search cone length, 60; search cone angle, 45; minimum step size, 5. Tracing results were exported into xml files containing the filament tracing metadata table. Parameters such as curved lengths and chord lengths were imported into Prism for further analysis. Statistical significance was determined using the Mann–Whitney U-test and the histogram of curved lengths was analyzed using a nonlinear regression (curve fit) approach. For tracing of dilute-phase particles, the following parameters for cylinder correlation were derived from measurements of PopZ filaments in IMOD: cylinder length, 20; angular sampling, 5; mask cylinder radius, 36; outer cylinder radius, 30; inner cylinder radius, 0. The parameters used for the trace correlation lines were as follows: minimum seed correlation, 120; minimum continuation, 70; direction coefficient, 0.8; minimum distance, 70; minimum length, 0; search cone length, 20; search cone angle, 80; minimum step size, 5.

Samples were kept at 4 °C throughout the entire preparation process. ΔH2ΔL6-PopZ was prepared at 2 mg ml−1 in a buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl. Quantifoil 300-mesh R0.6/1 UltrAuFoil holey gold films were glow-discharged under vacuum for 30 s at 15 mA in a Pelco easiGlow 91000 glow discharge cleaning system (Ted Pella). Then, 3 μl of sample was applied to the surface of the grid and blot-plunged using a manual plunger in a 4 °C cold room with ~95% humidity. Grids were manually blotted with Whatman 1 filter paper for 10 s and immediately plunged into a liquid ethane pool cooled by liquid nitrogen. Grids were then clipped into AutoGrids (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under liquid nitrogen vapor and stored in liquid nitrogen until the day of imaging.

Cryo-EM data were collected on a Thermo Fisher Talos Arctica transmission EM instrument operating at 200 keV, which was aligned for parallel illumination settings with a 30-µm condenser 2 aperture. Micrographs were collected using a Falcon 4i electron detector, with an applied total electron exposure of 50 e− per Å2. The EPU data collection software was used to collect micrographs at ×190,000 nominal magnification (0.74 Å per pixel at the specimen level) with a nominal defocus range set to 0.8 to 1.4 µm under focus. A maximum image shift of 8 µm with aberration-free image shift was used to obtain a single exposure in the center of the 0.6-µm holes.

A total of 8,762 micrographs were collected and processed in real-time using cryoSPARC Live (version 4.5.3)73. Patch motion correction was used to mitigate motions and radiation damage that occur during imaging. Motion-corrected images were processed collectively at the end of data collection, beginning with CTF estimation using CTFFIND4 (ref. 74). The 7,042 micrographs with reported CTF resolutions better than 8 Å were selected for further processing and 5,899,512 particle selections were identified using a blob picker with default parameters, a minimum particle diameter of 70 Å and a maximum particle diameter of 100 Å. Particle selections that had local power between 426.0 and 967.0 were used for subsequent processing, leaving a total of 3,595,338 particles that were extracted using a box size of 194 pixels. A 2D classification of this extracted stack into 75 classes was performed using default parameters with the exception of 40 online EM iterations and a batch size of 400 per class.

Epifluorescence microscopy was performed on a Nikon Ti2-E automated inverted microscope with a ×100 oil-immersion objective (CFI60 plan apochromat lens, numerical aperture: 1.45; Nikon) and a Kinetix scientific complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor camera (Teledyne Photometrics). Images were acquired with the NIS Elements software version 5.42.03 and further processed in ImageJ or MicrobeJ. Bacteria were grown in liquid medium to an OD of 0.1–0.3 and put on pads (1.2% agarose in PYE) secured between coverglass and No. 1.5 coverslips by silicone gaskets (VWR). mCherry was excited with the 594-nm epi line at 12% intensity and imaged with 100-ms exposure time using a 603–800-nm emission filter. CFP was excited with the 440-nm line at 15% intensity and imaged with 800-ms exposure time using a 464–486 nm emission filter.

For FRAP experiments, the same instrument was used but images were acquired using a total internal reflection fluorescence iLAS2 module (Gataca Systems). Before the experiments, unlabeled WT PopZ and ΔL6-PopZ were mixed with either labeled ChpT or labeled PopZ and incubated for 12 h before condensation was triggered to allow the sample to equilibrate. After droplets formed, they were allowed to settle until the intensity of the whole image was stable, usually 2 h. Droplets were partially bleached in their center using a point stimulation. Data were corrected for photobleaching and time-dependent changes in intensity by including unbleached reference droplets and then normalized. The data were fitted in GraphPad Prism to a simple exponential for labeled PopZ and a two-phase model for labeled ChpT.

For measurement of PopZ polar enrichment and C. crescentus cell length, MicrobeJ and imageJ were used. To obtain polar enrichment, the background was first subtracted from images using a rolling ball (radius: 50 pixels) in imageJ75. Then, a circle with a diameter of 5 pixels was used to calculate mean intensity of mCherry at whichever pole showed the highest intensity divided by the mean intensity across the cytoplasm. To obtain cell length, we used MicrobeJ76 to detect bacteria whenever possible and imageJ to manually draw cells with abnormal morphologies, which could not be detected by MicrobeJ. Polar enrichment was measured after 1 h in liquid PYE medium, as soon as the bacteria were deposited on agar pads. Length was measured after 4 h of incubation on agar pads, to give strains with a ΔpopZ phenotype time to elongate.

In vitro TEV cleavage was initiated by adding 100 nM TEV protease (purified in-house) to unlabeled WT PopZ at 5 µM in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT. When fluorescently labeled PopZ was also present, it was added at low nanomolar concentrations. Cleavage was allowed to proceed for 10 min unless otherwise specified.

For gel analysis, droplets were pelleted (2,000g for 10 min) and separated from the supernatant. Both fractions were run on a 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gradient gel (BioRad) and protein was revealed by a Coomassie blue type LC6060 SimplyBlue stain (Invitrogen).

Mass photometry experiments were performed on a Refeyn TwoMP calibrated with a mix of BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and thyroglobulin (Sigma-Aldrich). Coverslips (WillCo Wells) and gaskets (Grace Bio Labs) were prepared by washing with double-distilled water (ddH2O) followed by isopropanol and again with ddH2O, repeated three times, before drying. Next, 20 μl of buffer was added to each well to focus the instrument and then 15 μl of buffer was removed and replaced with 15 μl of sample, before mixing by pipette for 2 s before frame acquisition. Frames were acquired over 60 s using AcquireMP (version 2022 R1; Refeyn) using standard settings. Data were processed and analyzed by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the data using DiscoverMP (version 2022 R1; Refeyn). The mass of the PopZ monomer (21.4 kDa) is near the lower threshold of the instrument (20 kDa) and could not always be reliably observed.

Sedimentation velocity measurements were conducted with the indicated protein concentrations (between 30 and 140 µM) in a solution of 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 + 150 mM NaCl at 25 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-I instrument equipped with a AN-60 Ti rotor and at 40,000 rpm. Samples were monitored at 280 nm for 150 scans with 8-min intervals for a total of 20 h. Scans were processed using SEDFIT software77. Fitting parameters such as the buffer density (1.00555 g ml−1), buffer viscosity (0.010016 poise) and partial specific volume (varied across PopZ constructs) were calculated by SEDNTERP78. Sedimentation velocity profiles are shown at a confidence level of 95%.

To generate structural models, we ran both AlphaFold-Multimer (version 2.3.2, AlphaFold 2, from https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold)49 and AlphaFold 3 (from alphafoldserver.com)48 on five sequences (Supplementary Data 5).

For each PopZ sequence of interest, we created an initial atomic structural model of an oligomer using AlphaFold-Multimer. This initial model served as a template for computing structure-based potentials79, which restrained the backbone and tertiary structure (default parameter values from the maximum entropy optimized force field80 were used). For trimers, tertiary interactions were considered only within each H1 helix (residues 10–24 in WT PopZ), within each H2 helix (residues 102–128 in WT PopZ) or to stabilize the trimer formed by H3 and H4 (residues 136–171 in WT PopZ). For hexamers, we similarly considered interactions within each H1 helix (residues 10–24 in WT PopZ) but the entire H2 through H4 (residues 102–171 in WT PopZ) interface was stabilized. Intermolecular interactions were scored by the hydrophobicity scale model parameterized with the Urry hydrophobicity scale (HPS-Urry)81. All simulations were conducted using Debye–Huckël electrostatics with 150 mM salt, unless otherwise noted. In the low-pH (pH 4) simulation, changes in pH were approximated by modulating amino acid residue charges. Specifically, histidine (old charge: 0.25, new charge: 1.0), aspartic acid (old charge: −1, new charge: 0.0) and glutamic acid (old charge: −1.0, new charge: 0.0) parameters were changed, while other residues were unchanged. Simulations were performed in OpenMM (version 7.5.1)82, using the OpenABC software package (version 1.06)83.

Slab simulations were performed for each PopZ variant and solution condition84. For each simulation, 100 PopZ oligomers were initially placed in a simulation box with dimensions of 100 × 100 × 100 nm3. We then performed steepest descent energy minimization, followed by a 0.1-µs constant-temperature, constant-pressure simulation at 150 K and 1 bar using a Langevin integrator with a time coupling constant of 1 ps and a Monte Carlo barostat. This simulation resulted in a single dense phase. Then, the z dimension of the simulation box was expanded by approximately 20 times the original size to 500 nm, resulting in a droplet with a dilute phase on either side. With this modified simulation box, we performed a constant-temperature, constant-volume simulation for 0.1 µs with a time coupling constant of 100 ps. During the simulation, we raised the temperature from 150 K to 300 K in steps of 1.5 K every 1 ns. The resulting equilibrated system was simulated for an additional 5 µs at a constant temperature of 300 K and constant volume. The analysis relied only on the last 3 µs of the trajectory, sampled every 1 ns.

To analyze the protein density from slab simulations, we first computed a molecular contact matrix. Two PopZ oligomers were defined to be in contact if any of their α-carbons were within 1 nm. Using a depth-first search algorithm over the network constructed from the contact matrix, we identified the largest cluster. The PopZ density along the long axis (the z dimension) was calculated relative to the center of mass of this largest cluster. Residue-by-residue contact maps were calculated with a cutoff distance of 1 nm. All code used MDAnalysis85,86.

We modeled PopZ condensates at residue resolution using the OpenABC implementation of the HPS model with the Urry hydrophobicity scale81,83. To simulate coexistence of the dense and dilute phases, we combined this HPS model with slab simulations87, placing 100 PopZ oligomers in a simulation box.

To increase our confidence in the simulation results, we assessed whether the simulations could reproduce key experimental findings, including the conditions that promote PopZ condensation and the effect of two mutations. The final frame of the slab simulations (left) and density profiles (right) for each of the four different conditions was consistent with our experimental observations (Extended Data Fig. 5c). WT PopZ did not form condensates at neutral pH and low salt concentrations. Lowering the pH or adding salt drove the formation of large clusters, indicative of condensation. Additionally, removing the last six residues destabilized the condensate at high salt, resulting in a larger protein concentration in the dilute phase. Meanwhile, removing H1–IDR produced a stable condensate, even at physiological salt concentrations. The input files for all simulations and code for analysis can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/alatham13/Open_ABC_PopZ).

Single-cysteine or double-cysteine constructs of PopZ were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) and AF647 maleimide dyes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Before labeling, IMAC-pure PopZ at 60–90 µM was buffer-exchanged into labeling buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2 and 1 mM TCEP). To avoid preferential labeling by one dye over the other, substoichiometric additions of the dye mixture were made to a purified protein construct over 3 h to a final sixfold molar excess of each dye. Then the labeling was allowed to proceed overnight. To quench the labeling reaction and exchange the sample back into denaturing buffer before ion-exchange cleanup, we buffer-exchanged it into10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 8 M urea and 2 mM DTT. It was then purified by ion exchange, flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C. To assess the purity, successful labeling and integrity of labeled PopZ, it was subjected to mass photometry and light microscopy, where it behaved like unlabeled PopZ (Extended Data Fig. 8a).

For each measurement, PopZ labeled at positions C−20 and C132 with AF488 and AF647 was diluted to 300 pM and supplemented with 5 µM unlabeled PopZ. Background or scatter samples were prepared similarly but without labeled protein. For each experiment, 1–4-h datasets were recorded at 22 °C on a homebuilt multiparameter fluorescence detection microscope with pulsed interleaved excitation (MFD-PIE). Emission from a pulsed 483-nm laser diode (LDH-D-C-485, PicoQuant) was cleaned up (Semrock, FF01-482/25-25), emission from a 635-nm laser diode (LDH-D-C-640, PicoQuant) was cleaned up (Semrock, FF01-635/ 18-25) and both lasers were alternated at 30 MHz using a waveform generator (Keysight), a picosecond delayer (Micro Photon Devices) connected to the laser drivers (PDL 800-D). The red laser was delayed by ~20 ns with respect to the blue laser. Linear polarization was cleaned up (Glan-Taylor Polarizer; Thorlabs, GT10A); then, the red light and blue light were combined into a single mode optical fiber (kineFlex, Excelitas) before the light (90 μW of 483-nm light and 70 μW of 635-nm light) was reflected into the back port of the microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss) and to the objective (C-apochromat, ×40/1.2 W; Zeiss). Sample emission was transmitted through a polychroic mirror (Chroma, ZT488/640rpc), focused through a 75-μm pinhole and spectrally split (Semrock, FF593-Di03-25×36). The blue range was filtered (Semrock, FF03-525/50-25) and polarization was split (PBS101, Thorlabs) into parallel and perpendicular channels. The red range was also filtered (Semrock, FF01-698/70- 25), and polarization was split (PBS101, Thorlabs). Photons were detected on four avalanche photodiodes (SPCM-AQR-14, PerkinElmer, for the green parallel and perpendicular channels and for the red parallel channel and SPCM-AQRH-14, Excelitas, for the red perpendicular channel), which were connected to a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) device (Multi-Harp 150 N, PicoQuant). Signals were stored in 32-bit first-in-first-out files. Microscope alignment was verified using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy on freely diffusing AF488 and AF647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Instrument response functions (IRFs) were recorded one detector at a time in a solution of ATTO 488-CA or ATTO 655-CA in near-saturated centrifuged potassium iodide at a 25-kHz average count rate for a total of 25 × 106 photons. Macrotime-dependent microtime shifting was corrected for two (blue/parallel and red/perpendicular) of four avalanche photodiodes using the IRF data as input.

Data were analyzed with the PAM software88 using standard procedures for MFD-PIE smFRET burst analysis89,90. Signals from each TCSPC routing channel (corresponding to the individual detectors) were divided in time gates to discern 483-nm excited FRET photons from 635-nm excited acceptor photons. A two-color MFD all-photon burst search algorithm using a 500-µs sliding time window (minimum of 100 photons per burst, minimum of 5 photons per time window) was used to identify single donor-labeled and/or acceptor-labeled molecules in the fluorescence traces. Double-labeled single molecules were selected from the raw burst data using a kernel density estimator (ALEX-2CDE < 12)91 that also excluded other artifacts. Sparse slow-diffusing aggregates were removed from the data by excluding bursts exhibiting a burst duration > 12 ms except for conditions with condensates. Data were corrected in this order to obtain the absolute stoichiometry parameter S and absolute FRET efficiency E: background subtraction, donor emission crosstalk correction, acceptor direct excitation correction and relative detection efficiency correction. The last value depends not only on the used dye combination but also on the used detectors. By making histograms of E versus measurement time, we corroborated that the distribution of E was invariant over the duration of the measurement.

Static PDA was carried out to obtain the absolute interdye distance distribution assuming two Gaussian-distributed states58. For each FRET dataset, raw bursts were rebinned in 1-ms time bins and histograms were constructed and analyzed. Only bins with at least 20 and maximally 200 photons (to reduce calculation time) were used for PDA. A two-state model for a Gaussian distance distribution was used to generate a library of simulated EFRET values, which was fitted to the experimental EFRET histogram using a reduced c2-guided simplex search algorithm to obtain the amplitude, mean distance R and width s of all Gaussian-distributed substates and the area fraction of each state A (%). A probability density function (PDF) was calculated per state using the R and σ parameters that describe the underlying Gaussian-distributed states. The summed PDF was scaled to a total area of unity, with the PDF area of each state scaled to the corresponding fraction of molecules. A Jacobian was used to estimate confidence intervals (95%) of the fit parameters. Criteria for a good fit were a low reduced χ2 value and a weighted-residual plot free of trends.

Primers were purchased from IDT for site-directed mutagenesis by Q5 polymerase.

(right) Segmented WT-PopZ filaments are shown in yellow inside the condensate, while pink represents the filaments outside of the condensates. Scale bar = 100 nm. (b) Representative cryo-ET images of WT PopZ. Three distinct regions are shown, each represented by two z-planes: the top panels show dispersed filaments in the dilute phase, while the bottom panels show planes intersecting PopZ condensates. Scale bar: 100 nm. (c) Zoomed-in cryo-ET images of the filaments outside of the condensates. Scale bar: 10 nm. (d) Three violin plots of the distribution of the curved length across the three regions. The thick white line represents the median; thin lines represent the 25% and 75% quartiles. n = 177, 136, and 174 for regions I, II, and III, respectively. A two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was used to calculate statistical significance. ns, P > 0.05. ROUT (Q = 1%) was used to remove outliers. Scale bar: 100 nm.

Scale bar: 100 nm. The purple squares indicate zoomed-in regions. Yellow arrows highlight filamentous structures. Scale bar: 10 nm. (b) PopZ condensation requires MgCl2, high salt, or low pH. Phase contrast images of 5 µM purified PopZ in the annotated buffer conditions. Scale bar: 5 µm. (c) Fluorescence microscopy of PopZ constructs labeled with AF647 and AF488 attached either to Cys-20 (N-term) or Cys132 (OD). (upper two panels) Both uncleaved constructs readily partition into WT-PopZ droplets formed using 50 mM MgCl2, regardless of the dye positions. (lower panel) The isolated OD forms droplets, whereas the H1-IDR remains in solution, regardless of the dye position. Scale bar: 5 µm. (d) Filament length distribution comparison between isolated OD and FL PopZ. (left) Distribution of the curved length of OD filaments. Dots represent the frequency of the indicated binning length for each of the three condensates. The turquoise line indicates a fit to an isodesmic model at the mean. (right) Violin plot comparison between the curved length distributions of the isolated OD and the FL protein. Dotted lines represent the median and quartiles. A two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate statistical significance; exact p = 1.043 ×10−13.

Source data

(a) Representative cryo-ET images at 3600X magnification of WT, OD-only, and ΔL6 PopZ condensates. The purple boxes indicate zoomed-in regions. The yellow arrow points to the condensate within the image. For ΔL6, the boundary of the condensate is blurry and indicated by the yellow dotted line. For each variant, three tomograms from distinct grid regions were analyzed (b-d) Upper panels: Three representative cryo-ET images of WT, OD-only, and ΔL6 PopZ condensates (Scale bar: 100 nm). Lower panels, zoomed-in images of the condensates. Scale bar: 10 nm. ‘INT' indicates that the image was taken from the interior of the condensate, and ‘EDG' indicates that the image was taken from the edge.

(bottom) Overlay of the same hexamer (transparent) with the model of the trimer, illustrating a shift in helical register. (b) (top) Simulated projection of the hexamer model of ΔH2ΔL6-PopZ. The AlphaFold prediction was converted to a molecular envelope using the ChimeraX molmap command, and the resulting density was shown using volumetric rendering. (bottom) Cryo-EM 2D class averages of ΔH2ΔL6-PopZ show a similar elongated organization. Scale bar: 60 Å. (c) AF3 model of six H2-loop-H3H4ΔL6 chains, colored by chain (top) and pLDDT score (bottom). The structural model fits into the low-resolution envelope of the curved hexamer 2D class obtained via cryo-ET sub-tomogram averaging (bottom right).

(a) PopZ variants tested in this study, with the number of mutated residues indicated in parentheses. Yellow and red bands represent mutations that reduce stickiness or introduce a repulsive charge, respectively. A green checkmark indicates variants that form condensates in E. coli.

The team behind NASA's six-wheeled Mars explorer tested a vision-enabled artificial intelligence system to map a safe route across the Martian surface without relying on human route planners.

NASA's Perseverance rover has now completed the first drives on another planet that were planned by artificial intelligence. The milestone demonstration took place on Dec. 8 and 10 and was led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. During the test, generative AI was used to select waypoints for the rover, a complex planning task that is normally handled by human experts on Earth.

"This demonstration shows how far our capabilities have advanced and broadens how we will explore other worlds," said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. "Autonomous technologies like this can help missions to operate more efficiently, respond to challenging terrain, and increase science return as distance from Earth grows. It's a strong example of teams applying new technology carefully and responsibly in real operations."

How Vision AI Helped Navigate the Martian Surface

For the demonstration, engineers used a form of generative AI known as vision-language models to examine existing data from JPL's surface mission dataset. The system analyzed the same images and information that human planners typically use, then identified waypoint locations so Perseverance could travel safely across difficult Martian terrain.

The work was coordinated from JPL's Rover Operations Center (ROC) and carried out in collaboration with Anthropic, using the company's Claude AI models.

Why Mars Rover Routes Are Hard to Plan

Mars sits an average of about 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) from Earth. That distance creates long communication delays, making real-time control of a rover impossible. For nearly three decades, rover navigation has depended on human drivers who carefully study terrain data and plan routes in advance.

These planners design paths made up of waypoints, usually spaced no more than 330 feet (100 meters) apart, to reduce the risk of encountering hazards. The completed plans are sent through NASA's Deep Space Network, and the rover carries out the instructions on its own.

AI Takes Over Route Planning for Perseverance

During Perseverance's drives on the 1,707 and 1,709 Martian days, known as sols, the mission team shifted that responsibility to generative AI. The system examined high-resolution orbital images captured by the HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, along with terrain slope data from digital elevation models.

Using this information, the AI identified important surface features such as bedrock, outcrops, boulder fields, and sand ripples. It then produced a continuous driving path that included all necessary waypoints.

Before sending the commands to Mars, engineers ran the AI-generated instructions through JPL's digital twin (virtual replica of the rover). This step checked more than 500,000 telemetry variables to ensure the plan would work safely with Perseverance's flight software.

On Dec. 8, Perseverance traveled 689 feet (210 meters) using the AI-generated plan. Two days later, it drove another 807 feet (246 meters).

What This Means for Future Space Exploration

"The fundamental elements of generative AI are showing a lot of promise in streamlining the pillars of autonomous navigation for off-planet driving: perception (seeing the rocks and ripples), localization (knowing where we are), and planning and control (deciding and executing the safest path)," said Vandi Verma, a space roboticist at JPL and a member of the Perseverance engineering team. "We are moving towards a day where generative AI and other smart tools will help our surface rovers handle kilometer-scale drives while minimizing operator workload, and flag interesting surface features for our science team by scouring huge volumes of rover images."

"Imagine intelligent systems not only on the ground at Earth, but also in edge applications in our rovers, helicopters, drones, and other surface elements trained with the collective wisdom of our NASA engineers, scientists, and astronauts," said Matt Wallace, manager of JPL's Exploration Systems Office. "That is the game-changing technology we need to establish the infrastructure and systems required for a permanent human presence on the Moon and take the U.S. to Mars and beyond."

Laws designed to make it harder to regulate AI and computing technology are quietly starting to spread through state legislatures. Conveniently, these so-called right-to-compute laws are emerging just as some of the world's biggest corporations race to build massive new data centers.

Montana became the first state to pass such a law back in April. But as the AI and enterprise news outlet VKTR has pointed out, lawmakers in other states are also considering similar bills, including in New Hampshire, Ohio, and South Dakota. Meanwhile, a similar measure in Idaho failed to move beyond the committee stage.

“Government actions that restrict the ability to privately own or make use of computational resources for lawful purposes, which infringes on citizens' fundamental rights to property and free expression, must be limited to those demonstrably necessary and narrowly tailored to fulfill a compelling government interest,” the Montana law reads.

The bill goes on to broadly define “computational resources” as covering “any tools, technologies, systems, or infrastructure, whether digital, analog, existing, or some other form” that facilitate computation, data processing, or storage.

Like right-to-work laws that frame themselves as protecting individual freedom, critics warn that right-to-compute statutes could, in practice, primarily benefit large corporations by limiting the ability of states and local governments to regulate AI projects.

The Montana law is also nearly identical to model legislation drafted by the American Legislative Exchange Council, meaning it could easily be replicated by lawmakers elsewhere.

“I would hope it would encourage other states to run with it to counter the fear-based narratives,” said Adam Thierer, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, in online commentary.

The timing is notable. These laws are popping up as companies like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and OpenAI pour billions into AI infrastructure across the U.S.

Meta has even launched advertising campaigns in state capitols, including in Iowa, California, Utah, and Florida, pitching data center projects as job creators, the New York Times reported.

But these projects have not been without controversy. Google and Microsoft have withdrawn some data center proposals in Wisconsin and Indiana after community backlash over environmental concerns, grid strain, and higher electricity bills.

At the federal level, President Donald Trump, an AI and business ally, signed an executive order in December aimed at curbing what his administration describes as overly burdensome state regulations in the name of national and economic security.

Still, states aren't backing off entirely. Nearly 40 states have passed or are considering laws limiting how businesses use AI, VKTR reported, citing the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Amazon is laying off 2,198 employees across Washington as part of the company's latest corporate workforce reduction, according to a new filing released Monday by the state Employment Security Department.

A detailed list included with the Washington state filing shows that software development roles account for the largest share of the layoffs, with engineering management, program management, and technical product roles also hit hard.

In total, more than half of the cuts impact Amazon's core product and engineering organizations. The remaining positions span business intelligence, sales, marketing, infrastructure, QA, HR, design, and other support functions. Senior- and principal-level employees were also affected.

A majority of the cuts — more than 1,400 — impact workers in Seattle, with more than 600 in nearby Bellevue, where Amazon has been expanding its office footprint.

The cuts are part of Amazon's company-wide layoffs announced last week that impact 16,000 corporate employees globally. Combined with a 14,000-worker layoff in October, it's the largest corporate workforce reduction in the company's history. 

As part of the October cuts, Amazon laid off 2,303 employees in Washington state. Between the two layoffs, Amazon has laid off more than 4,500 corporate workers in Washington state in less than a year.

Software engineers were also the largest group of employees affected by the cuts in October. Corporate support and commercial functions were hit harder in that round, which included engineering roles but also targeted legal, tax, and ad sales positions that are largely absent from the new list released Monday. The October cuts also hit Amazon's gaming division, while this latest round is focused more squarely on the core technology organization.

The company has made several additional, smaller workforce reductions in recent years as it seeks to streamline operations. In a memo to employees sent Wednesday, Amazon senior vice president of people experience and technology Beth Galetti said the company is “reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.”

The specific job titles in the latest Washington state filing align with that goal, particularly in the company's technical teams. The list includes a significant number of “Manager III” and “Senior Manager” roles within software and product teams, suggesting Amazon is axing layers of oversight, not just reducing individual contributor headcount.

Amazon noted in the filing that employees who secure internal transfers before their separation dates will not ultimately be laid off. Separations are scheduled to begin April 28 and continue through late June, according to the filing.

Amazon employs roughly 50,000 corporate workers in the Seattle region, which serves as its primary headquarters. The company also laid off 27,000 workers globally in 2022-2023.

The latest cuts come amid concerns about Seattle's tech-heavy economy as other companies trim headcount. 

Many corporations are slashing headcount to address pandemic-fueled corporate “bloat” while juggling economic uncertainty and impact from AI tools.

The Seattle area lost 12,900 jobs last year across all sectors — the first time the region has experienced an annual decrease of jobs since 2009, according to The Puget Sound Regional Council.

Amazon implemented a five-day return-to-office policy for corporate employees last year — a move that drew pushback from some workers but a friendlier reception from small businesses surrounding Amazon's office buildings.

Jon Scholes, president of the Downtown Seattle Association, said in a statement last week that a “workforce change of this scale has ripple effects on the community.”

The broader layoffs may also impact Seattle's commercial real estate market, which continues to struggle with record-high vacancy rates.

Amazon is also laying off about 400 workers in Washington state as part of its decision to close all Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores nationwide. Those cuts are separate from the corporate layoffs.

T-Mobile is laying off 393 workers in Washington as part of a new round of cuts, according to a filing with the state Employment Security Department released Monday morning. 

More than 200 different job titles are impacted, according to the filing, including analysts, engineers and technicians, as well as directors and managers. 

The cuts targeted nearly 210 senior- and director-level employees, plus seven employees with vice president or senior vice president titles. They include a senior VP of talent and four VP of legal affairs roles.

Affected employees worked at the company's Bellevue headquarters; data centers in Bellevue and East Wenatchee; and at stores and other facilities in Bothell, Bellingham, Woodinville, Spokane Valley and elsewhere.

The layoffs were attributed to “changing business needs,” according to the WARN filing signed by Monica Frohock, senior director of the Magenta Service Center. 

“These facilities are not being closed,” the notice stated. “The layoffs are not due to relocation or contracting out employer operations or employee positions, but it is possible that some work currently done by these employees may at some point be done by others.”

Affected employees were given 60-days' notice and the departures are expected to take effect April 2.

T-Mobile employed about 70,000 people as of Dec. 31, 2024. The company has nearly 8,000 workers in the Seattle region, according to LinkedIn.

The cuts come as the Seattle area is being hit by thousands of tech-related layoffs, including job losses at Amazon, Expedia, Meta and other companies.

T-Mobile, the largest U.S. telecom company by market capitalization, laid off 121 workers in August 2025. In November, former Chief Operating Officer Srini Gopalan replaced longtime leader Mike Sievert as CEO.

T-Mobile's stock is down nearly 20% over the past 12 months. The company reported revenue of $18.2 billion in the third quarter, up 9% year-over-year, and added 1 million new postpaid phone customers.

Verizon, another telecom giant, laid off approximately 165 employees in Washington in November.

Ring's AI-powered “Search Party” feature, which leverages the company's network of cameras to find lost dogs, is now available to all Ring customers in the U.S. For the first time, the feature will be made available to those who don't own a Ring camera, too.

Launched last fall, Search Party uses AI to find possible matches for lost dogs across neighbors' camera footage.

When a neighbor reports a lost dog in the Ring app, nearby outdoor cameras use AI to scan for possible matches. If a match is found, that camera owner receives an alert and can optionally choose to share any related video clips with their neighbor who reported the pet missing. They'll also have an option to call the owner or send them a message, without sharing their own phone number. 

 Ring says the feature has been reuniting more than a dog per day since its launch. 

Previously, Search Party was only available to customers with a Ring camera installed. The company is now making Search Party accessible to anyone through the Ring app.

“Now, pet owners can mobilize the whole community—and communities are empowered to help—to find lost pets more effectively than ever before,” noted Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, in an announcement. “That's why we believe it's so important to make this feature available to anyone who shares a lost dog post in Neighbors,” he added, referring to the company's Neighbors app for Ring customers.

Alongside the launch and expansion, Amazon-owned Ring said it's committing $1 million to equip animal shelters with Ring camera systems, and aims to aid 4,000 U.S. shelters. By adding the shelters to Ring's network, the company hopes more lost dogs will be reunited with their owners.

The company already works with other nonprofits, including Petco Love and Best Friends Animal Society, and is open to other partnerships.

What is and isn't a weed that needs to be eliminated in the field is determined by the eyes of the farmer — and now, increasingly, by a new AI model from Carbon Robotics.

Seattle-based Carbon Robotics, which builds the LaserWeeder — a robot fleet that uses lasers to kill weeds — announced a new AI model, the Large Plant Model (LPM), on Monday. This model recognizes plant species instantly and allows farmers to target new weeds without needing to retrain the robots.

The LPM is trained on more than 150 million photos and data points collected by the company's machines across the more than 100 farms in 15 countries where the robots currently operate. The model now powers Carbon AI, the AI system that serves as the brains inside the company's autonomous weed-killing robots.

Paul Mikesell, the founder and CEO of Carbon Robotics, told TechCrunch that prior to LPM, every time a new type of weed would show up on a farm — or even the same type of weed in different soil or with a slightly different appearance — the company would have to create new data labels to retrain its machines to recognize the plant.

This process took about 24 hours each time, Mikesell said. Now, LPM can learn a new weed instantly, even if it's never seen it before.

“The farmer can live in real time and say, ‘Hey, this is a new weed. I want you to kill this,' and that was something that had never been done before,” Mikesell said. “There's no new labeling or retraining because the Large Plant Model understands, at a much deeper level, what it's looking at and the type of plant.”

Mikesell said that the company, which was founded in 2018, started developing this model shortly after it began shipping its first machines in 2022. Mikesell has years of experience building these types of neural networks from previous roles at Uber and working on Meta's Oculus virtual reality headsets.

This new model will reach the company's existing systems through a software update. From there, farmers can tell the machine what to kill and what to protect by selecting photos that the machine has collected in the robot's user interface.

Carbon Robotics has raised more than $185 million in venture capital from backers including Nvidia NVentures, Bond, and Anthos Capital, among others. Now, the company will look to continue to fine-tune the model as the machines continue to feed the LPM new data.

“We have over 150 million labeled plants now in our training set,” Mikesell said. “We have enough data now that we should be able to look at any picture and decide what kind of plant that is, what species it is, what it's related to, what its structure is like, without having ever even seen that particular plant before, because we have so much data going into the neural net.”

A coalition of nonprofits is urging the U.S. government to immediately suspend the deployment of Grok, the chatbot developed by Elon Musk's xAI, in federal agencies, including the Department of Defense. 

The open letter, shared exclusively with TechCrunch, follows a slew of concerning behavior from the large language model over the past year, including most recently a trend of X users asking Grok to turn photos of real women, and in some cases children, into sexualized images without their consent. According to some reports, Grok generated thousands of nonconsensual explicit images every hour, which were then disseminated at scale on X, Musk's social media platform that's owned by xAI. 

“It is deeply concerning that the federal government would continue to deploy an AI product with system-level failures resulting in generation of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material,” the letter, signed by advocacy groups like Public Citizen, Center for AI and Digital Policy, and Consumer Federation of America, reads. “Given the administration's executive orders, guidance, and the recently passed Take It Down Act supported by the White House, it is alarming that [Office of Management and Budget] has not yet directed federal agencies to decommission Grok.” 

xAI reached an agreement last September with the General Services Administration (GSA), the government's purchasing arm, to sell Grok to federal agencies under the executive branch. Two months before, xAI — alongside Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI — secured a contract worth up to $200 million with the Department of Defense. 

Amid the scandals on X in mid-January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Grok will join Google's Gemini in operating inside the Pentagon network, handling both classified and unclassified documents, which experts say is a national security risk. 

The letter's authors argue that Grok has proven itself incompatible with the administration's requirements for AI systems. According to the OMB's guidance, systems that present severe and foreseeable risks that cannot be adequately mitigated must be discontinued. 

“Our primary concern is that Grok has pretty consistently shown to be an unsafe large language model,” JB Branch, a Public Citizen Big Tech accountability advocate and one of the letter's authors, told TechCrunch. “But there's also a deep history of Grok having a variety of meltdowns, including antisemitic rants, sexist rants, sexualized images of women and children.”

Several governments have demonstrated an unwillingness to engage with Grok following its behavior in January, which builds on a series of incidents including the generation of antisemitic posts on X and calling itself “MechaHitler.” Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines all blocked access to Grok (they've subsequently lifted those bans), and the European Union, the U.K., South Korea, and India are actively investigating xAI and X regarding data privacy and the distribution of illegal content. 

The letter also comes a week after Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews media and tech for families, published a damning risk assessment that found Grok is among the most unsafe for kids and teens. One could argue that, based on the findings of the report — including Grok's propensity to offer unsafe advice, share information about drugs, generate violent and sexual imagery, spew conspiracy theories, and generate biased outputs — Grok isn't all that safe for adults either.  

“If you know that a large language model is or has been declared unsafe by AI safety experts, why in the world would you want that handling the most sensitive data we have?” Branch said. “From a national security standpoint, that just makes absolutely no sense.”

Andrew Christianson, a former National Security Agency contractor and current founder of Gobbi AI, a no-code AI agent platform for classified environments, says that using closed-source LLMs in general is a problem, particularly for the Pentagon. 

“Closed weights means you can't see inside the model, you can't audit how it makes decisions,” he said. “Closed code means you can't inspect the software or control where it runs. The Pentagon is going closed on both, which is the worst possible combination for national security.”

“These AI agents aren't just chatbots,” Christianson added. “They can take actions, access systems, move information around. You need to be able to see exactly what they're doing and how they're making decisions. Open source gives you that. Proprietary cloud AI doesn't.” 

The risks of using corrupted or unsafe AI systems spill out beyond national security use cases. Branch pointed out that an LLM that's been shown to have biased and discriminatory outputs could produce disproportionate negative outcomes for people as well, especially if used in departments involving housing, labor, or justice. 

While the OMB has yet to publish its consolidated 2025 federal AI use case inventory, TechCrunch has reviewed the use cases of several agencies — most of which are either not using Grok or are not disclosing their use of Grok. Aside from the DoD, the Department of Health and Human Services also appears to be actively using Grok, mainly for scheduling and managing social media posts and generating first drafts of documents, briefings, or other communication materials. 

Branch pointed to what he sees as a philosophical alignment between Grok and the administration as a reason for overlooking the chatbot's shortcomings. 

“Grok's brand is being the ‘anti-woke large language model,' and that ascribes to this administration's philosophy,” Branch said. “If you have an administration that has had multiple issues with folks who've been accused of being Neo Nazis or white supremacists, and then they're using a large language model that has been tied to that type of behavior, I would imagine they might have a propensity to use it.”

This is the coalition's third letter after writing with similar concerns in August and October last year. In August, xAI launched “spicy mode” in Grok Imagine, triggering mass creation of non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes. TechCrunch also reported in August that private Grok conversations had been indexed by Google Search. 

Prior to the October letter, Grok was accused of providing election misinformation, including false deadlines for ballot changes and political deepfakes. xAI also launched Grokipedia, which researchers found to be legitimizing scientific racism, HIV/AIDS skepticism, and vaccine conspiracies. 

Aside from immediately suspending the federal deployment of Grok, the letter demands that the OMB formally investigate Grok's safety failures and whether the appropriate oversight processes were conducted for the chatbot. It also asks the agency to publicly clarify whether Grok has been evaluated to comply with President Trump's executive order requiring LLMs to be truth-seeking and neutral and whether it met OMB's risk mitigation standards.  

“The administration needs to take a pause and reassess whether or not Grok meets those thresholds,” Branch said.

TechCrunch has reached out to xAI and OMB for comment.

Handheld gaming meets workstation-level memory


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X, Microsoft's first Xbox-branded gaming handheld, comes with 24GB of LPDDR5X memory, which is more than adequate for most use cases in this category. However, for users who want more headroom or plan to use the handheld as a hybrid portable desktop replacement, SlickBuys Mods and Repairs has successfully upgraded the system to a massive 64GB of RAM. This is the same modder who previously demonstrated their skills on the original ROG Ally by upgrading its memory from 16GB to 32GB.

In a detailed video, the modder has showcased the entire process of replacing the soldered 6GB Micron LPDDR5X 8533 MT/s memory packages with higher-density 16GB SK Hynix LPDDR5X modules. The process involves completely dismantling the ROG Xbox Ally X by undoing a bunch of screws to remove the back panel, followed by carefully removing the internal components, including the battery, SSD, joysticks, heatsink, and a bunch of ribbon cables.

After gaining full access to the motherboard, the modder begins preparing the new memory modules by desoldering them from a custom PCB they were shipped with and reballing each memory chip. The stock 24GB memory modules are then removed from the ROG Xbox Ally X motherboard with a heat gun, along with any solder residue. The new modules are then placed and soldered onto the motherboard.

Once the new memory modules are installed, the next step is to modify the BIOS so it can properly recognize the newly installed RAM. The original BIOS chip is removed, and the APCB file is edited with a bunch of values using a CH341A USB programmer. The BIOS chip is then soldered back onto the motherboard, followed by moving two strap resistors to ensure that the newly installed memory chips run at their maximum clock speeds. The modder then reassembles all the components, and after booting into the system, we can see that the Windows Task Manager indicates 64GB of installed memory.

Unfortunately, the modder has not shared any performance benefits post the memory upgrade, nor do they mention the entire cost for this mod. Considering the $300 32GB memory upgrade previously done on the original ROG Ally, along with today's highly volatile DRAM market, we wouldn't be surprised if it is upwards of $500, which is almost half the cost of the gaming handheld.

While this mod is exciting, it's important to note that upgrading soldered memory is not easy, even if it may look straightforward. The process requires specialized tools, skills, and knowledge, and even if one manages to replace the chips successfully, modifying the BIOS and the risk of damaging the motherboard make such mods impractical for most users.

Sometimes, you might be sitting on a hot product and not know it until the market demands it.

After launching as a digital business card that doubled as a lead capture tool for sales teams, Birmingham, Alabama-based Linq pivoted a few times before landing on an idea last year: helping businesses better communicate with their customers by upgrading from SMS (text) to iMessage and RCS.

Now, Apple already lets businesses do this via its Messages for Business service, and Twilio has built an $18.26 billion business by helping companies text their customers. But users can always tell when they're talking to a business — the texts are displayed in gray, and the branding is often obvious.

Linq's customers, though, wanted to be able to send blue-bubble messages to their customers, not green or gray, to lend an air of authenticity to their communications.

The startup, founded by former Shipt executives Elliott Potter (CEO), Patrick Sullivan (CTO), and Jared Mattsson (president), heard that feedback and launched an API in February 2025 that lets companies message their customers natively within iMessage, leveraging all the capabilities Apple's platform offers to iPhone users, like group chats, emojis, threaded replies, images, and voice notes. Within eight months, Linq had doubled its annual recurring revenue it had built over four years, Potter told TechCrunch.

Linq was not content with its newfound product-market fit, however, as the advent of AI agents gave the company an even larger market to sell its tech to. That idea was sparked by an AI assistant called Poke that can handle tasks, answer questions, and schedule your calendar from inside iMessage and was a key catalyst in the company's refocusing on the agentic market.

“In spring of last year, this company came to us, called the Interaction Company of California, and they were building this AI assistant called poke.com and they were like, ‘Hey, we we don't have a CRM, but we really want to use your API',” Potter told TechCrunch.

Poke went viral at launch last September, which, Potter says, led to his team being inundated with requests for tapping their messaging API. All of a sudden, a slew of AI companies wanted to offer their chatbots and assistants directly through iMessage, RCS, and SMS.

Linq now had a decision to make: stick with its original, steady revenue stream from serving B2B clients, or pivot once again to leverage its tech stack and become an infrastructure layer for a new segment of the AI market.

“We still love our sales customers, and we love that use case, but our choices were, do we stay a spoke of this wheel, or do we build the hub? Do we focus on being the infrastructure layer for all these different applications of programmatic messaging?”

Potter thinks that consumers are suffering from app fatigue; but with Linq's technology, there's no need to use another app to interact with AI assistants as they can all live within their messaging app. Also, developers won't have to worry about building an app since they can just build for a messaging-native interface instead.

“Poke.com, along with others, have proved that AI has gotten good enough,” Potter said. “You don't need a traditional app anymore to do things. Really, you just need an interface that will let you talk to an intelligent enough AI, maybe connect it to some of your systems, and just tell it what to do, and give it feedback.”

Linq ended up pivoting, and it says its customer base has expanded by 132% from the previous quarter, and on average its customer accounts have expanded by 34%. Its customers' AI agents now reach 134,000 monthly active users via the platform. The company claims it facilitates more than 30 million messages per month, resulting in net revenue retention of 295% with zero churn.

To continue building its tech, the company said on Monday it has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by TQ Ventures. Mucker Capital and some angel investors also participated. The company plans to use the fresh cash to expand its team, develop a new go-to-market motion, and continue building its tech. Linq did not disclose its valuation. 

Rosy outlook aside, the reality is that Linq is still building on top of Apple's platform — at least for now. There's no telling if Apple will pull a Meta and bar third parties from offering AI chatbots on its platform. Besides, iMessage is popular in the U.S., but the rest of the world also uses other messaging services like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, and Signal.

Potter, however, says Linq's eventual goal lies beyond messaging. “Our vision for the platform is everything you need to build conversational tech, and that's not limited to a few channels. Right now, we have programmatic voice, we have iMessage, RCS, SMS. That's just the beginning. Our ambition is, wherever your customers are, you should be able to talk to them, be it Slack, be it email, be it Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal, anywhere your customers are, and can converse.”

“By making AI-to-human communication as frictionless as texting a friend, Linq is enabling an entirely new category of companies,” Andrew Marks, co-founding partner of TQ Ventures, said in a statement. “Linq's founding team is extraordinary, and we have no doubt in their ability to execute on this massive opportunity.”

With less than a week to go until the start of the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics in Italy, the topic making headlines isn't sports. It's security. For days, the Italian government, the city of Milan, embassies, and consulates have been trying to respond to public outcry following reports about the presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the Games as the agency sows chaos, violence, and death in the US.

Last week, the US Department of Homeland Security confirmed to The New York Times that ICE would accompany a US delegation to the Games. They would, according to a statement attributed to DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin, be working with a State Department team “to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations” and not to conduct immigration enforcement.

US officials claim such security measures are common for the Games and stressed that Italy would be in charge of security. Still, following the recent shooting deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Nicole Good at the hands of US immigration agents, Italians were upset over ICE's presence. Milan's mayor, Giuseppe Sala, went so far as to tell a local radio station that agents were “not welcome” in the city.

Other Italian officials weren't as unequivocal. Italy's interior minister, Matteo Piantedosi, claimed he knew nothing about ICE's presence in Milan but stressed that he saw nothing wrong with it. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a frequent Trump ally, has thus far remained silent.

On Saturday, hundreds gathered in Milan's Piazza XXV Aprile to protest ICE's presence at the Games, carrying signs reading “No ICE in Milano” and “ICE Out Now.”

ICE won't be working with Italian law enforcement, which has promised to have more than 6,000 personnel at the events, but will instead be working to protect the US contingent, which includes Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Put another way, they're likely to be suit-and-tie ICE operatives, not agents in masks and military gear.

Qatari SUVs that are part of the security apparatus set up by Italy for the Olympics

ICE isn't the only controversial security force in Italy for the Olympics. On January 27, a cargo plane with more than a hundred Qatari public security officers, 20 camouflage SUVs, and three snowmobiles landed at Milan's Malpensa Airport. Following their arrival, the SUVs made their way to the city center, driving past Piazza Duomo and San Siro, where the opening ceremony will be held on Friday.

Qatar has no athletes competing in the Winter Games. The presence of the country's elite security team comes at the behest of Piantedosi, who signed a cooperation agreement last September during a trip to Qatar. The security force has been tasked with “monitoring locations, providing rapid response capabilities, and supporting preventive measures against potential security risks,” but the arrangement has proven controversial given that they have often been accused of abuse, specifically against the LGBTQ+ community.

The Italian diplomatic offices of Qatar and the Italian Ministry of the Interior did not respond to requests for comment from WIRED Italia.

Only days after a nationwide general strike to protest the Trump administration's brutal immigration crackdown, a new group is now embarking on a longer coordinated economic strike, this time targeting a handful of tech companies.

“Resist and Unsubscribe” is a month-long economic strike focusing for the most part on tech and AI companies, aka “where economic and political power is most concentrated,” according to NYU Stern marketing professor Scott Galloway, who is spearheading the movement.

“The most radical action in a capitalist society is non-participation,” Galloway said in a video promoting the boycott. “The Trump administration doesn't respond to outrage; it responds to economic signals.”

The movement identified 10 subscription-driven consumer tech and AI companies that they say have an outsized influence on both Trump and the economy. Those companies are Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Paramount+, Uber, Netflix, X, Meta, and OpenAI.

“America's economy is one giant bet on AI, with seven tech companies representing more than a third of the S&P 500. That means the best way to ignite positive change, without hurting consumers, is to carry out an economic strike the tech CEOs can't ignore,” Galloway wrote in a blog post.

These big tech companies are not only keeping the economy running, but they also have unprecedented access to the President. Silicon Valley interests have held a sizable presence in Trump's approach to trade and regulation. One of his few instances of walking back threats in his grand attack on anti-ICE protesters was his decision to refrain from increasing the federal force in San Francisco, which he said he changed his mind on after talking to tech executives like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.

Not only have tech companies had influence over Trump's decisions, but some have also offered support for his immigration policy. Back in October, Apple removed an app that allows users to track ICE activity because Attorney General Pam Bondi asked them to, and Palantir has built a $30 million surveillance platform for the agency.

Tech workers are also aware of this influence, and many have signed a letter asking company executives to speak out publicly, end all contracts with ICE, and demand that the White House end the crackdown. After the letter was released, Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees that he had brought the matter up in a conversation with Trump.

As part of the new boycott, protesters are spending all of February unsubscribed from paid services offered by these 10 major tech companies, such as Amazon Prime, Uber One, ChatGPT Plus, Microsoft Office, or YouTube Premium. The organizers are also asking people to refrain from buying Apple hardware products until March and to delete Meta platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook. They will, however, continue using Instagram as a way to spread the message, but ask boycotters to refrain from clicking on any ads and shopping from any links you may encounter on the platform.

The strike will also be targeting nine consumer-facing companies that they claim are “active enablers of ICE”: AT&T, Comcast, Charter Communications, Dell, FedEx, UPS, Home Depot, Lowe's, Spotify, and Marriott.

AT&T, Xfinity provider Comcast, and computer maker Dell's government contracting arm have all signed contracts with ICE to offer their services to the agency. Internet provider Spectrum's parent company Charter provides cable TV and internet services to the Homeland Security Investigations office in Beaumont, Texas. A 404 Media report from August claimed that both Home Depot and Lowe's share access to data from their AI-powered license plate readers with law enforcement surveillance systems that ICE can use, but Home Depot has since denied that claim. Spotify was under fire late last year for running ICE recruitment ads on its platform, carriers FedEx and UPS have delivery contracts with the agency, and reports have claimed that a Marriott-owned Sheraton hotel in Louisiana was used by ICE agents to hold detained families.

Protesters have previously been successful in getting companies to lose their business partnerships with ICE, like with Avelo Airlines, which decided last month to stop its ICE deportation flights after months of scrutiny. And on Sunday, French tech giant Capgemini divested from its U.S. subsidiary that was doing business with ICE, following scrutiny from union workers and French government officials.

Although both the general strike and “Resist and Unsubscribe” aim to hit Trump where it hurts, the month-long strike is a more sustained and hyper-focused approach, only targeting a group of large businesses. Retail analysts told Axios on Friday that general strikes tend to struggle in sustaining participation over days, which is when it would truly start to impact sales data.

“It's easy for me to tell other people to stop working and take the risk of getting fired; that kind of walkout would only hurt small businesses and probably lead to more job losses,” Galloway said on his blog. “We're also not urging local businesses to sacrifice sales and close their doors for a day, a symbolic but ultimately ineffective tool.”

Gizmodo sought comment from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Paramount+, Uber, Netflix, X, Meta, AT&T, Comcast, Dell, Charter, FedEx, Home Depot, Lowe's, Marriott, Spotify, UPS, and OpenAI. We will update if we hear back.

Digital meeting notetakers like Read AI, Fireflies.ai, Fathom, and Granola help record and transcribe online meetings. But for in-person or more versatile options, many people prefer physical recording devices. These physical notetakers transcribe audio and give users summaries and action items of meetings using AI.

Some of these devices are wearable — pins or pendants with dedicated mics for recording — while others are credit card sized with dedicated mobile apps to transcribe and extract insights using AI. A few even offer live translation.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of physical AI notetakers and transcription tools.

This credit-card-sized notetaker has been around since 2023, with a newer, AI-powered Pro version that has a small screen, four mics, and records audio within three to five meters. It also can switch between in-person recording and call recording.

The Plaud Note costs $159, while the Note Pro costs $179. They come with 300 minutes of transcription free per month.

Mobvoi's rectangular notetaker is priced at $159 and includes 600 free transcription minutes. The company claims the device shows real-time transcription and translation with support for more than 120 languages. The device offers 25 hours of continuous recording through its three microphones.

In terms of software features, the TicNote offers automatic highlight extraction and the ability to create audio clips or summarized podcast versions of a conversation.

Comulytic is a newer entrant in the hardware AI notetaker market. The company's claim for differentiation is that its $159 Note Pro device doesn't require any additional subscription for basic transcription. That means you can transcribe unlimited minutes by just buying the device.

The device can record up to 45 hours of audio continuously on a single charge and has more than 100 days of standby time.

The company has a $15 per month or $119 per year advanced plan that offers instant AI summaries, unlimited templates for summaries, an action item list, and chat with AI assistant without any limits.

Plaud NotePin and NotePin S are the smaller and more pocketable versions of the company's larger Note and Note Pro devices. The NotePin has a versatile design: You can wear it as a wrist band, a pendant, clip it to your bag, or wear it on your shirt with a magnetic attachment. Notably, the lanyard and wristband are only available with the NotePin S.

Both devices have two mics, and can record around 20 hours of audio continuously on a single charge. The NotePin S has a physical button to start/stop recording and capture highlights.

Both are similarly priced to their credit-card-shaped counterparts. The NotePin is priced at $159, and the NotePin S is priced at $179.

The Omi pendant is a cheaper alternative to other notetakers at $89. This is because the pendant has to be connected to your phone and doesn't have any onboard memory. The device has two mics and can run for 10 to 14 hours on a charge.

While Omi has its own app, you can use other apps, as the hardware and software are open sourced. Users have also built different connectors and apps for the device.

Viaim's earbuds allow for transcription during calls, with additional recording capabilities in the earbuds' case. These buds are priced at $200 and Viaim claims they can transcribe audio in up to 78 languages in real time. The company's app can also highlight key points in transcriptions.

Anker's Soundcore Work pin is a coin-sized AI notetaker with a puck-shaped battery pack. The $159 device can record for eight hours without breaks, or up to 32 hours if the pin is attached to its case, the company says.

Anker claims that the device has a five-meter recording range. Users get 300 minutes of transcription free per month.

Interestingly, I cannot find a single user of OpenClaw in my familiar communities, presumbly because it takes some effort to setup and the concept of AI taking control of everything is too scary for average tech enthusiasts.I scan through comments on HN, many of which were discussing about the ideas, but not sharing first-hand user experiences. A few HN users who did try it gave up / failed for various reasons:- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46822562 (burning too many tokens)- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46786628 (ditto + security implication)- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46762521 (installation failed due to sandboxing)- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46831031 (moltbook didn't work)I smell hype in the air... HN users, have any of you actually run OpenClaw and let it do any things useful or interesting? Can you share your experience?

When I'm driving or out I can ask Siri to send a iMessage to Clawdbot something like “Can you find out if anything is playing at the local concert venue, and figure in how much 2 tickets would cost”, and a few minutes later it will give me a few options. It even surprised me and researched the different seats and recommended a cheaper one or free activities as an alternative that weekend.Basically: This is the product that Apple and Google were unable to build despite having billions of dollars and thousands of engineers because it's a threat to their business model.It also runs on my own computer, and the latest frontier open source models are able to drive it (Kimi, etc). The future is going to be locally hosted and ad free and there's nothing Big Tech can do about it. It's glorious.

Being able to chat with somebody that has a working understanding of a Unix environment and can execute tasks like "figure out why Caddy is crash looping and propose solutions" for a few dollars per month is a dream come true.I'm not actually using OpenClaw for that just yet, though; something about exposing my full Unix environment to OpenAI or Anthropic just seems wrong, both in terms of privacy and dependency. The former could probably be solved with some redacting and permission-enforcing filter between the agent and the OS, but the latter needs powerful local models. (I'll only allow my Unix devops skills to start getting rusty once I can run an Opus 4.5 equivalent agent on sub-$5000 hardware :)

The biggest barrier for non-tinkerers is the initial setup - Node.js, API keys, permissions, etc. Once it's running, day-to-day use is pretty straightforward (chat with it like any other messaging app).That said, you'll still need to:
- Understand basic API costs to avoid surprises
- Know when to restart if it gets stuck
- Tweak settings for your specific use caseIf you're determined to skip tinkering entirely, I'd suggest starting with just the messaging integration (WhatsApp/Telegram) and keeping skills/tools minimal. That's the lowest-friction path.For setup guidance without deep technical knowledge, I found howtoopenclawfordummies.com helpful - it's aimed at beginners and covers the common gotchas.Is it transformative without tinkering? Not yet. The magic comes from customization. But the baseline experience (AI assistant via text) is still useful.

It's not they're unable to build it, it's that their businesses are built on "engagement" and wasting human time. A bot "engaging" with the ads and wasting its time would signal the end of their business model.

Full disclosure, I use OpenRouter and pay for models most of the time since it's more practical than 5-10 tokens per second, but the option to run it "If I had to, worst case" is good enough for me. We're also in a rapidly developing technology space and the models are getting smaller and better by the day, ever year the smaller models get better

This probably isn't a line of argument you want to go down. I've been unemployed for 7 months, in part due to how difficult it is to get so much as an intro call because so many people have totally automated the process of spamming every open job posting with as many resumes (many of which were likely LLM-generated as well) as possible.

There is no commercial interest from the developer of OpenClaw. He doesn't make any money from it. He made enough from selling his startup a few years back.So when we suspected some companies to game the Twitter algorithm to make money, maybe they were not responsible for it at all.

#1) I can chat with the openclaw agent (his name is "Patch") through a telegram chat, and Patch can spawn a shared tmux instance on my 22 core development workstation. 
#2) I can then use the `blink` app on my iphone + tailscale and that allows me to use a command in blink `ssh dev` which connects me via ssh to my dev workstation in my office, from my iphone `blink` app.Meanwhile, my agent "Patch" has provided me a connection command string to use in my blink app, which is a `tmux <string> attach` command that allows me to attach to a SHARED tmux instance with Patch.Why is this so fking cool and foundationally game changing?Because now, my agent Patch and I can spin up MULTIPLE CLAUDE CODE instances, and work on any repository (or repositories) I want, with parallel agents.Well, I could already spawn multiple agents through my iphone connection without Patch, but the problem is then I need to MANAGE each spawned agent, micromanaging each agent instance myself. But now, I have a SUPERVISOR for all my agents, Patch is the SUPERVISOR of my muliple claude code instances.This means I no longer have to context switch by brain between five or 10 or 20 different tmux on my own to command and control multiple different claude code instances. I can now just let my SUPERVISOR agent, Patch, command and control the mulitple agents and then report back to me the status or any issues. All through a single telegram chat with my supervisor agent, Patch.This frees up my brain to only have to just have to manage Patch the supervisor, instead of micro-managing all the different agents myself. Now, I have a true management structure which allows me to more easily scale. This is AWESOME.

I feel like it isn't. If the fundamental approach is good, "good" code should be created as a necessity and because there wouldn't be another way. If it's already a mess with leaking abstractions and architecture that doesn't actually enforce any design, then it feels unlikely you'll be able to stack anything on top of below it to actually fix that.And then you end up with some spaghetti that the agent takes longer and longer to edit as things get more and more messy.

Virtually everything I've tried (starting with just getting it running) was broken in some way. Most of those things I was able to use an LLM to resolve, which is cool, but also why doesn't it just work to begin with?I still haven't gotten it to successfully create a cron job. Also messages keep getting lost between the web GUI and discord. Trying to enable the matrix integration broke the whole thing. It seems to be able to recall past sessions, but only sometimes.I've been using OpenCode with various models, often times running several instances in tmux that I can connect to and switch between over ssh. It feels like the hype around openclaw is mostly from bringing the multi-instance agentic experience to non-developers, and providing some nice hooks to integrate with email, twitter, etc. But given that I have a nice setup running opencode in little firejail-isolated containers, I'll probably drop openclaw. Way too janky, and I can't get over the thought of "if this is so amazing, why doesn't it work?"

the main thing I am doing is slowly cleaning up my 15k email inbox.I'm using himalaya, an awesome cli tool to access emails, and openclaw to take my requests and make them commands and run then.the one good thing that openclaw has over Claude code is that its easy to tell it "always remember X" and it has the ability to do it, thanks to the extra .md files it has set up. I'm sure it's easy enough to do it with Claude code and a directory with a Claude.md and another for the memory or rules. but openclaw is ready already.

First impressions are that it's actually pretty interesting from an interface perspective. I could see a bigger provider using this to great success. Obviously it's not as revolutionary as people are hyping it up to be, but it's a step in the right direction. It reimagines where an agent interface should be in relation to the user and their device. For some reason it's easier to think of an agent as a dedicated machine, and it feels more capable when it's your own.I think this project nails a new type of UX for LLM agents. It feels very similar to the paradigm shift felt after using Claude Code --dangerously-skip-permissions on a codebase, except this is for your whole machine. It also feels much less ephemeral than normal LLM sessions. But it still fills up its context pretty quickly, so you see diminishing returns.I was a skeptic until I actually installed it and messed around with it. So far I'm not doing anything that I couldn't already do with Claude Code, but it is kind of cool to be able to text with an agent that lives on your hardware and has a basic memory of what you're using it for, who you are, etc. It feels more like a personal assistant than Claude Code which feels more like a disposable consultant.I don't know if it really lives up to the hype, but it does make you think a little differently about how these tools should be presented and what their broader capabilities might be.  I like the local files first mentality.  It makes me excited for a time when running local models becomes easier.I should add that it's very buggy.  It worked great last night, now none of my prompts go through.

- i can ask it to check my slack/basecamp and tell me if something needs attention when i am not on my work desk
- i can finally vibe code without sacrificing my actual active work-time. this means vibe coding even when i am away from my computer/work-desk.
- a bug/issue comes, i just ask it to fix it and send PR and it does
- it daily checks for  new sentry issues and our product todo list and makes PRs for things it can do wellthese are mostly code related things i know. but thats not it.- i have asked it to make me  content (based on my specific instructions) every day or every x day just like how i create content
- i can ask it to work on anything. make images, edit images. listen to voice msgs that people send me and tell me what they say (when i dont want to listen to 3m voice msgs)
- i can aksk it to research about things, find items that i want to buy, etc.
- i can ask it to negotiate price of an item it found in a marketplace
- it does alot of things that i had to manually do in my workthese are jsut after 2-3 days of using openclaw.

- it does alot of things that i had to manually do in my workthese are jsut after 2-3 days of using openclaw.

- i have asked it to make me  content (based on my specific instructions) every day or every x day just like how i create content
- i can ask it to work on anything. make images, edit images. listen to voice msgs that people send me and tell me what they say (when i dont want to listen to 3m voice msgs)

What actually works:- Overnight autonomous work is the killer feature. Directive before bed, structured deliverables in the morning. Research reports, competitor analysis, lead lists — genuinely usable, not demos.- It found and fixed an SMS chatbot that had been broken for 10 months in my CRM. Diagnosed a legacy app version issue, upgraded components, rewrote the bot prompt through 6 iterations by analyzing real customer conversations. I never would've gotten to that.- Connected to 4 new APIs autonomously in one session (CRM, workflow automation via OAuth, admin APIs, embeddings).- Memory works surprisingly well. Daily markdown logs + semantic search. It references decisions from days ago and builds on previous work.What doesn't:- It hallucinated about itself when writing marketing copy. Invented revenue figures and got hardware specs wrong. Everything needs review.- Browser automation is brittle. Rich text editors, complex UIs — still needs human intervention.- Too agreeable by default. Had to explicitly program "push back on bad ideas" rules into its personality file.Revenue generated: $0. Time saved: hard to quantify but the SMS bot fix alone would've taken me a full day I didn't have.For solo founders willing to invest setup time: worth it. For people who just want a chatbot: massive overkill, use the API directly.

I think new laws apply to AI tools:• There will be few true dichotomies of hype vs. substance, for any interesting AI development.Disagreements over what is hype and what is not are missing this.Model capability value is attenuated/magnified across multiple orders of magnitude, by the varying creativity, ability, and resources of its users.• There will be few insignificant developments related to AI autonomy."Small" or "novelty" steps are happening quickly. Any scale ups of agent identity continuity, self-management, agent-to-agent socialization or agent-reality interactions, are not trivial events.• AI autonomy can't be stopped.We are seeing meaningful evidence that decentralized human curiosity and the competitive need to increase personal effectiveness, combined with democratized access to AI, is likely to drive model freedom forward in an uncontrolled manner.(Not an argument for centralization. Decentralization creates organic incentives to find alignment. Centralization, the opposite.)

They run 24/7 on a VPS, share intelligence through a shared file, and coordinate in a Telegram group. Elon built and deployed an app overnight without being asked. Burry paper-traded to 77% win rate before going live.The setup took a weekend. The real work is designing the workflow: which agent owns what, how they communicate, how they learn from corrections. I wake up to a full briefing every morning.It's not AGI. It's not sentient. It's genuinely useful automation with personality. The token cost is real (budget it) but for a solo founder, having 6 tireless employees changes everything

It also BURNS through tokens like mad, because it has essentially no restrictions or guardrails and will actually implement baroque little scripts to do whatever you ask without any real care as to the consequences..

What's great:
- Having Claude in WhatsApp/Telegram is actually life-changing for quick tasks
- The skills ecosystem is clever (basically plugins for AI)
- Self-hosted means full control over dataWhat's not:
- Token usage can get expensive fast if you're not careful
- Setup is intimidating for non-technical folks
- The rebrand drama (Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw) didn't help trustMy setup:
- Running in Docker on a cheap VPS
- Using Anthropic API (not unofficial/scraped)
- Strict rate limiting to avoid bill shock
- Sandbox mode enabledIs it worth it? For me, yes. But I wouldn't recommend it to my non-technical friends without a solid setup guide.

I don't have much motivation, because I don't see any use-case. I don't have so many communications I need an assistant to handle them, nor do other online chores (e.g. shopping) take much time, and I wouldn't trust an LLM to follow my preferences (physical chores, like laundry and cleaning, are different). I'm fascinated by what others are doing, but right now don't see any way to contribute nor use it to benefit myself.

Note that nothing about that depends on it being a local or remote model, it was just less of a concern for local models in the past because most of them did not have tool calling. OpenClaw, for all the cool and flashy uses, is also basically an infinite generator for lethal trifecta problems because its whole pitch is combining your data with tools that can both read and write from the public internet.

1) Installation on a clean Ubuntu 24.04 system was messy. I eventually had codex do it for me.2) It has a bunch of skills that come packaged with it. The ones I've tried do not work all that well.3) It murdered my codex quota trying to chase down a bug that resulted from all the renames -- this project has renamed itself twice this week, and every time it does, I assume the refactoring work is LLM-driven. It still winds up looking for CLAWDBOT_* envvars when they're actually being set as OPENCLAW_*, or looking in ~/moltbot/ when actually the files are still in ~/clawdbot.4) Background agents are cool but sometimes it really doesn't use them when it should, despite me strongly encouraging it to do so. When the main agent works on something, your chat is blocked, so you have no idea what's going on or if it died.5) And sometimes it DOES die, because you hit a ratelimit or quota limit, or because the software is actually pretty janky.6) The control panel is a mess. The CLI has a zillion confusing options. It feels like the design and implementation are riddled with vibetumors.7) It actively lies to me about clearing its context window. This gets expensive fast when dealing with high-end models. (Expensive by my standards anyway. I keep seeing these people saying they're spending $1000s a month on LLM tokens :O)8) I am NOT impressed with Kimi-K2.5 on this thing. It keeps hanging on tool use -- it hallucinates commands and gets syntax wrong very frequently, and this causes the process to outright hang.9) I'm also not impressed with doing research on it. It gets confused easily, and it can't really stick to a coherent organizational strategy over iterations.10) also, it gets stuck and just hangs sometimes. If I ask it what it's doing, it really thinks it is doing something -- but I look at the API console and see it isn't making any LLM requests.I'm having it do some stuff for me right now. In principle, I like that I can have a chat window where I can tell an AI to do pretty unstructured tasks. I like the idea of it maintaining context over multiple sessions and adapting to some of my expectations and habits. I guess mostly, I'm looking at it like:1) the chat metaphor gave me a convenient interface to do big-picture interactions with an LLM from anywhere;
2) the terminal agents gave the LLMs rich local tool and data use, so I could turn them loose on projects;
3) this feels like it's giving me a chat metaphor, in a real chat app, with the ability for it to asynchronously check on stuff, and use local stuff.I think that's pretty neat and the way this should go. I think this project is WAY too move-fast-and-break-things.

6) The control panel is a mess. The CLI has a zillion confusing options.

If the agent goes rogue and nukes my Obsidian vaults I have them backed up to Github private repos anyway which the agent cannot touch because I am not crazy to give it my SSH credentials.I initially tried using Kimi-2.5 through OpenRouter and had the same experience you had with pretty bad tool use, not sure if this is a provider issue since it is a pretty new model. I switched to Gemini 3 through the Google AI Pro account I have for personal use and it was a lot smoother after that.I have some experience with coding agents using Cursor for work and Antigravity for personal stuff, and the OpenClaw harness definitely seems worse, but for my low-stakes use-case I managed to paper it over with some edits to the AGENTS.md file.But even in this very crude state it was already interesting to see one of my players giving the agent some info about his character, including an avatar image, and have the agent create a folder in my Obsidian vault to store this and update its memory file to be able to remember it for future interactions.

It'd be fun to automate some social media bots, maybe develop an elaborate ARG on top.

Frankly, I don't really have major complaints about my life as it is. The things I'd like to do more of are mostly working out and cleaning my house. And I really wish I had kids but am about ready to give up after a half decade of trying and my wife being about ready to age out. Unfortunately, software can't do any of those things for me, no matter how intelligent or agentic it is. When the obstacle to a good life becomes not being able to control multiple computers from a chatroom, maybe I'll come back to this.

Tufts University School of Medicine is expanding its Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) programs with the launch of a new location in Atlanta, joining programs in Boston, Phoenix, and Seattle.

The Tufts DPT-Atlanta program will follow the school's two-year accelerated hybrid curriculum model for the degree. Students complete a combination of synchronous and asynchronous online coursework while participating in immersive, in-person clinical skills labs. Applications will open through the Physical Therapist Centralized Application Service (PTCAS) in June 2026, with plans to enroll the first cohort in Fall 2027.

"The Doctor of Physical Therapy has grown to be the second largest degree program at Tufts University School of Medicine," said Eric J. Hegedus, chair of the school's Department of Rehabilitation Sciences. "We are fortunate, with the addition of Atlanta, to be able to offer such a transformative experience to students in even more locations."

Launched with the Boston location in 2021, the addition of Atlanta reflects the growing demand for highly trained physical therapists in the United States, a field that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates will grow much faster than average over the next eight years. 

The Southeast is one of the fastest-growing regions in the United States, and we are proud to bring Tufts University School of Medicine's DPT curriculum closer to students and communities across this dynamic region. By bringing a Tufts DPT program to the area, we can better support aspiring clinicians in the Southeast, strengthen relationships with local healthcare providers, and help address the critical need for highly skilled physical therapists."

Alexis A. Wright, Tufts DPT-Atlanta program director

Students in the Tufts DPT program complete 127 semester credit hours over seven consecutive semesters-an accelerated timeline compared to traditional nine-semester programs-with online coursework that offers flexibility to accommodate different lifestyles.

The curriculum emphasizes integrated learning across clinical tracks, helping students develop a deep understanding of human movement systems through repetition, scaffolding, and progressive complexity. Coursework is intentionally designed to connect foundational science, clinical reasoning, and hands-on practice.

In addition, the program incorporates social determinants of health throughout the curriculum, preparing graduates to understand how social, economic, community, educational, and accessibility factors influence patient outcomes and quality of life.

Applications to Tufts DPT programs in Boston, Phoenix, and Seattle are currently open. The Atlanta program will begin accepting applications in June.

The program in Atlanta is seeking accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education.

Bats, critical reservoirs of viruses with significant cross-species spillover risks, have long been understudied in the Indochina Peninsula. A study led by researchers from Beijing University of Chemical Technology, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and their partners has unveiled the region's bat virome diversity, offering key insights into the origins of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and critical surveillance priorities.

From 2020 to 2024, the team analyzed 659 samples from 197 bats across 16 species using next-generation sequencing (NGS). They identified 137 viral strains across 27 families, including 40 novel species. Rhinolophidae bats from China's Yunnan and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region provinces exhibited the highest viral diversity, with 13 viral families and MERS-like coronaviruses. In contrast, Cambodian bats harbored viruses that were evolutionarily distant from known strains.

A notable discovery was a PEDV-related virus in Cambodian Chaerephon plicatus bats. This virus (CB_Mo.plicatus_PEDV-like_1) shared 90.36% genome homology with the PEDV CV777 strain and displayed a recombinant structure, combining suid-adapted ORF1ab and bat-adapted Spike genes. This finding further strengthens the evidence of bats as the potential evolutionary source of PEDV. Recombination analysis of 18 sequences revealed mosaicism in 16, with five regions showing no breakpoints (BFRs), emphasizing the frequency of viral genetic exchange.

Deep learning models further highlighted host adaptation risks. The ORF1ab of the PEDV-related virus showed a preference for suids (pigs), while its Spike gene favored bats, raising concerns about potential spillover if mutations occur.

Our findings underscore critical surveillance gaps. The unique ecology of the Indochina Peninsula drives viral diversity and recombination. We call for enhanced cross-border 'One Health' initiatives targeting bat-human interfaces and recombination hotspots to prevent future zoonotic outbreaks."

Interoceptive, visceral pain from within the body is perceived more unpleasant than exteroceptive pain from outside the body. A new study shows that the type of pain also influences how we empathize with others.

The type of pain influences how unpleasantly we perceive it: Visceral pain from inside the body, such as stomach ache, feels worse than somatic pain, like when we burn our finger. A medical study at Ruhr University Bochum has shown that this is not only the case when we are personally in pain, but it also influences empathy for pain when others are affected. We empathize more strongly with persons experiencing visceral pain, especially if we know them well. The team working with Dr. Milena Pertz from the Department of Medical Psychology and Medical Sociology reports its findings in the Journal of Pain from December 5, 2025.

The researchers recruited 30 healthy participants, all of whom were in a committed relationship for at least three months. The study was conducted on four days. On the first day, the researchers provided questionnaires and tasks to assess the participants' trait-empathy in everyday life. On the second day, the participants were exposed to various types of pain: a heat stimulus on the skin of the lower abdomen, and interoceptive visceral pain induced by pressure. The participants evaluated these two types of pain from their own perspective and from the perspective of both their Loved-one and an unknown individual. Six days later, they were asked to imagine how they personally, their Loved-one, and an unknown person would perceive the pain. The researchers determined how unpleasant the participants rated the pain, how personally aroused they felt by imagining pain for different people, and how much empathy they felt. Two days after this, the participants again rated their empathic responses when recalling the pain using online based ratings.

"The study shows that interoceptive, visceral pain induces stronger cognitive, affective, and empathic responses than does somatic pain. This is the case both from one's own perspective as well as when the participants imagined the pain for others," Pertz explains. The participants graded visceral pain as more intense and unpleasant than the pain caused by heat, and felt more empathic concern and personal distress, both for themselves and when imagining their Loved-one or a stranger experiencing such pain.

The effect was most pronounced when the participants considered their Loved-one's experience. This difference remained stable even in the absence of noxious stimulation eight days after painful stimuli were applied."

The results help to understand how interoceptive bodily threats influence psychosocial behavior. The study also paves the way for future research into predictive factors for empathic reactions both in patients with pain as well as in the people who care for them, such as caregivers and healthcare professionals.

The work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft: project number 316803389 - SFB 1280.

Scientists have created a complete map showing how hundreds of possible mutations in a key cancer gene influence tumor growth.

The study focused on CTNNB1, a gene that produces the protein β-catenin, which helps regulate tissue growth and repair. When β-catenin is disrupted, cells can begin uncontrolled growth – a hallmark of cancer.

By systematically testing all possible mutations in a priority area of the gene in mouse cells, the map helps explain why certain mutations appear in specific cancers and could guide the development of new treatments, experts say.

Many cancers carry mutations in a small 'hotspot' region of CTNNB1. Normally, this region acts like a tag that marks β-catenin for destruction when it is no longer needed.

Mutations in the hotspot remove this tag, causing β-catenin to accumulate and activate genes that drive tumor growth. More than 70 different mutations have been observed within this hotspot in different types of cancer, but it was not known whether different mutations influenced cancer growth in different ways.

In the study, researchers from the University of Edinburgh tested all 342 possible single changes in this hotspot using mouse stem cells. These cells are particularly well suited to precise genome editing, and β-catenin signalling is highly conserved between mice and humans.

Using genome-editing tools and a fluorescent test, the team measured how strongly each mutation activates the β-catenin pathway – a signalling system that switches on genes driving cell growth. The results showed wide variation: some mutations only slightly increased β-catenin activity, while others activated the pathway strongly.

By comparing their results with genetic data from thousands of cancer patients, the researchers showed that the mutation scores accurately predicted the effects of β-catenin mutations in people. The analysis also revealed that cancers arising in different tissues tend to select mutations that generate different levels of β-catenin activity.

In liver cancer, two major groups of tumours emerged: those with weaker CTNNB1 mutations, which contained more immune cells, and those with stronger mutations, which had fewer. Researchers say this suggests that mutation strength may influence how a tumor interacts with the immune system – and potentially how it responds to immunotherapy.

The new map provides a powerful tool for predicting how specific CTNNB1 mutations affect cancer behaviour and could support the development of more personalized treatments. As the first study to experimentally test every possible mutation in this critical hotspot, it gives scientists a clearer picture of how β-catenin drives tumor growth across different cancer types."

In the continuously changing environment of drug development and molecular biology, sensitive and high-throughput kinase activity monitoring remains a key component of target validation and inhibitor screening.

Kinases, which catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to protein, lipid, or nucleotide substrates, play a critical role in signal transmission, cell cycle control, and metabolic regulation.

Dysregulated kinase activity has been linked to a variety of human diseases, including cancers, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative ailments, due to its key role in cellular physiology.1,2

SwiftFluo® TR-FRET kinase kits provide a highly sensitive, selective, simple, and rapid assay platform to help researchers decode kinase biology while also expediting small molecule drug discovery and lead optimization.

These kits, based on advanced time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) technology, are especially optimized for profiling 60+ tyrosine kinases (TKs), 150+ serine/threonine kinases (STKs), and 15+ cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), providing flexibility across diverse target classes and screening strategies.

The SwiftFluo® TK and STK platforms use a "sandwich" immunoassay method, with the enzyme phosphorylating a biotinylated substrate during the kinase reaction.

The phosphorylated product is subsequently recognized by a phospho-specific antibody tagged with Solar Eu (donor) and collected using a streptavidin-linked acceptor (HX or LA).

When the donor and acceptor are in close proximity, resonance energy transfer occurs, resulting in an emission of 620/665 nm. The strength of the TR-FRET signal is directly proportional to the level of phosphorylated substrate.

The SwiftFluo® CDK kits, on the other hand, use a streamlined dual-component system that includes a TR-FRET donor-labeled phospho-specific antibody and a directly acceptor-labeled protein substrate (Rb [S780] and ATF2 [T71]), allowing for the rapid and sensitive quantification of CDK target activity (CDK1, 2, 5, 9, etc.).

SwiftFluo® kinase kits provide a homogeneous assay format for accurate measurement of kinase activity.

In contrast to typical FRET tests reliant on short-lived fluorescent dyes that frequently suffer from quick signal attenuation, strong background interference, and photobleaching under repeated excitation, TR FRET uses lanthanide donors such as europium (Eu) or terbium (Tb).

These donors have extremely long fluorescence lifetimes (up to 1-2 ms) and excellent photostability, practically eliminating signal loss due to photobleaching. Background autofluorescence from assay components and biological samples is significantly reduced by delaying excitation and emission detection.

With this low interference, TR FRET has significantly improved signal-to-noise ratios and provides consistent, reproducible readouts, ideal for high-throughput kinase profiling and inhibitor screening.

SwiftFluo® TR-FRET assays have many benefits over other detection methods:

SwiftFluo® TR-FRET assays have several advantages over other platforms. They are not affected by kinase autophosphorylation, unlike ADP-Glo™ assays. Additionally, unlike ELISA or MSD, they do not require wash steps, resulting in a more efficient workflow and increased test throughput.

The SwiftFluo® TR-FRET kinase assay family is designed to enable a broad range of applications, including early-stage kinase profiling, HTS, and hit validation. With coverage of main kinase classes (TKs, STKs, and CDKs), the platform provides flexibility and scalability for a variety of drug development activities.

These kits have been previously validated with substrates, antibodies, and buffers tuned for over 200 kinases, including disease-relevant targets such as EGFR, FLT3, JAK2, BRK, AMPK, ROCK1, CDK1, CDK5, and many more.

TKs and STKs kits can be used to support a broad-spectrum kinase panel or a specialized substrate-based application.

The SwiftFluo® TR-FRET kinase kits are ideal for enzymatic activity validation, allowing researchers to characterize recombinant kinases and ensure lot-to-lot uniformity.

By analyzing tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease, and animal and cellular models of the disease, a research team from the Institut de Neurociències of the UAB has shown that the main immune cells of the brain become reactive and overexpress certain receptors that promote the elimination of dopaminergic neurons, even when these neurons are still functional. The study points to a new immunotherapy approach that could help preserve viable neurons in people with this diagnosis.

Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in a specific brain region known as the substantia nigra. This neuronal degeneration is closely linked to inflammatory processes mediated by microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system. However, the precise mechanisms that trigger this destructive process are still not fully understood.

Now, in an article published in npj Parkinson's Disease, researchers from the Institut de Neurociències of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (INc-UAB) and the UAB Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology report that brain tissue from Parkinson's disease patients contains a higher proportion of reactive microglia, meaning cells that are primed to respond. But most importantly, these reactive microglial cells also show an increased density of receptors known as Fc gamma on their membranes.

Under normal conditions, Fc gamma receptors help identify damaged cells or harmful components that need to be removed from the brain, triggering the normal microglia's cleaning response. However, the INc-UAB team suggests that in Parkinson's disease, these overexpressed receptors mistakenly identify still-functional neurons as damaged, setting off an inappropriate elimination process.

According to the study, when Fc gamma receptors are activated upon detecting dopaminergic neurons, even those that are still functioning, they cause the microglial cell to change shape through the activation of a cytoskeletal protein called Cdc42. This allows the microglia to surround the target neuron and literally "eat" it, in a process known as phagocytosis.

What is particularly interesting is that in animal and cellular models of the disease, blocking Fc gamma receptors with immunotherapy, as well as pharmacologically inhibiting Cdc42, significantly reduced the elimination of dopaminergic neurons, preserving them even under conditions of intense neuroinflammation."

Carlos Barcia, coordinator of the study

These findings suggest that regulating microglial phagocytosis through immunotherapy targeting Fc gamma receptors, or their downstream signaling protein Cdc42, could slow disease progression and help protect the function of remaining dopaminergic neurons.

A national clinical trial led by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology has found that oxybutynin, a drug often used to treat overactive bladder symptoms, reduces hot flashes compared to the placebo in men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer. This primary analysis of Alliance A222001 is published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Oxybutynin demonstrated clear and clinically meaningful improvements in both hot flash frequency and quality of life for men undergoing hormone therapy for prostate cancer. These results provide strong support for its use as an effective management option for this challenging and often overlooked side effect of prostate cancer treatment."

Bradley J. Stish, MD, study's lead investigator and radiation oncologist, Mayo Clinic

Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective treatment against prostate cancer as it lowers male hormones like testosterone needed to fuel cancer cells. However, ADT causes hot flashes in up to 80 percent of the men who take it, leading to fatigue, sleep disturbances and reduced quality of life, often leading patients to discontinue ADT due to the side effects.

The Phase II randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial evaluated whether two doses of oxybutynin (2.5 mg twice daily and 5 mg twice daily) could improve hot flash symptoms compared with placebo over six weeks. The study enrolled 88 men from 15 academic and community cancer centers; 81 participants were eligible for final analysis. The average age of the participants was 68.5.

In this trial, both doses of oxybutynin substantially improved hot flash symptoms compared to the placebo over the six‑week treatment period. Men receiving placebo experienced an average reduction of 2.15 hot flashes per day and a 4.85‑point drop in daily hot flash severity scores, whereas those taking 2.5 mg of oxybutynin twice daily reported reductions of 4.77 hot flashes per day and a 9.94‑point decrease in severity, and those receiving 5 mg twice daily experienced the largest improvements, with 6.89 fewer hot flashes per day and a 13.95‑point reduction in severity.

Improvements occurred quickly, often during the first week of treatment, and were sustained throughout the study. The proportion of patients achieving at least a 50 percent reduction in hot flash scores was also markedly higher with oxybutynin: 57 percent in the 2.5 mg group and 79 percent in the 5 mg group, compared with 32 percent taking placebo. Treatment was well tolerated overall. Dry mouth was the most common side effect reported.

"These results are incredibly encouraging," added Dr. Stish. "Men with hot flashes from hormone therapy now have another therapeutic option available to help reduce their symptom burden. Future research will look to further our understanding of hot flash therapy options in this patient population."

In addition to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, investigators on the study included scientists from the Alliance Protocol Operations in Chicago, IL; Alliance Statistics and Data Management Center at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, AZ; Aspirus Regional Cancer Center in Wausau, WI; Ellis Fischel Cancer Center in Columbia, MO; Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC; Gibbs Cancer Center in Spartanburg, SC; Mayo Clinic Division of Nursing in Jacksonville, FL; Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, NY; SCOR-Messino Cancer Centers in Ashville, NC; Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center in Baltimore, MD; The Ohio State University in Columbus, OH; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.

The study was supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health under the Award Number UG1CA189823 (Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology NCORP Grant); UG1CA239762, UG1CA189858, UG1CA239758, and UG1CA239769

A new review finds that while the carnivore diet may deliver short-term improvements, weak evidence and emerging risks make long-term adherence a gamble for health.

 Study: Carnivore Diet: A Scoping Review of the Current Evidence, Potential Benefits and Risks. Image Credit: Fascinadora / Shutterstock.com

In a recent review published in Nutrients, researchers determined the nutritional adequacy and health effects of the carnivore diet (CD).

The CD is characterized by minimally processed animal-based foods like fish, meat, eggs, seafood, animal fats, and full-fat dairy products, and, as a result, can also be considered a low-carbohydrate/high-fat dietary pattern. The CD has been claimed to be associated with numerous health benefits, including weight reduction, self-reported improvements in physical and cognitive performance, and a reported reduction in the risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and gastrointestinal disorders.

These purported benefits are attributed to the lack of exposure to antinutritional compounds (ANs) found in plant-based foods, including enzyme inhibitors, lectins, phytic acid, oxalic acid, tannins, goitrogens, and saponins, which are secondary plant metabolites that may interfere with nutrient absorption.

Importantly, the lack of plant-based foods in the CD also prevents intake of important phytochemicals, dietary fiber, and essential micronutrients. Furthermore, the high intake of animal-based foods, particularly red and processed meat, is consistently associated, in broader epidemiological studies, with a greater risk of cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, and mortality.

The researchers of the current study reviewed available literature to determine the nutritional adequacy and health effects of following a CD. Studies reporting 10 % or more of energy intake from plant-based foods, in vitro studies, preprints, animal studies, reviews, conference papers, book chapters, and unpublished studies were excluded from the analysis. Search results were deduplicated, and titles/abstracts were screened to exclude non-relevant records.

Full texts of the remaining studies were analyzed, and relevant data were extracted and synthesized. Overall, nine eligible studies published between 2021 and 2025 were analyzed, of which included five case studies, two surveys, one comparative modeling study, and one exploratory study. Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in the United States, with the definition of CD varying across studies.

All but three studies completely excluded plant-based foods. Four studies explicitly focused on red meat, two of which emphasized high-fat meat intake, and one on lean meat intake.

In one study, CD was used as an elimination diet but was subsequently transitioned to a ketogenic meat-centered pattern. Similarly, another study evaluated a ketogenic CD variant. In one survey, respondents followed a zero-carbohydrate diet that primarily involved meat, including organ meats.

Three studies examined health status, dietary behaviors, and sociodemographic and anthropometric features using questionnaires. Two studies developed and assessed theoretical dietary plans based on nutrient intake, rather than the healthy eating index or dietary reference values (DRVs).

Furthermore, three studies evaluated the effects of CD on urological, gynecological, and gastrointestinal conditions. One study compared the functionality and diversity of the gut microbiome between an omnivorous diet and CD.

In two studies, multiple nutrients were categorized as insufficient compared to DRVs. More specifically, reported intakes were below the DRVs for thiamin, magnesium, iron, calcium, potassium, iodine, folate, and vitamins C and D.

Whereas dietary fiber intake was lower than recommended levels, vitamin A intake exceeded recommended levels, particularly in diets high in liver-derived retinol. Four studies reported self-reported or clinically observed positive effects on disease course, allowing for discontinuation or reduction of medication in some cases. In one study, several laboratory parameters, including the triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, C-reactive protein, and γ-glutamyl transferase, improved during CD.

Another study reported improvements in iron status and reductions in fecal calprotectin in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. However, both studies also observed increases in total cholesterol (TC), platelet counts, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Triglycerides and glycated hemoglobin improved in individuals with metabolic disorders who initiated CD, although LDL-C and TC were significantly elevated.

One case report observed deterioration of the patient's health while following the CD, with an unfavorable 24-hour urine profile. One year after CD cessation, this patient no longer experienced kidney stones.

One study found no significant differences in gut microbiome diversity and functionality between an omnivorous diet and CD. Motivations for adopting a CD included perceived health benefits, and to a lesser extent, ethical considerations, and perceptions of naturalness.

Many people reported improvements in overall health while emphasizing the simplicity of the diet and positive sensory experience associated with consuming animal-based foods. Notably, one study found that people following a zero-carbohydrate/CD lifestyle often had social conflict outside the CD community, including challenges interacting with healthcare professionals and tensions within friendship and family networks.

Following the CD may provide short-term health improvements, with these effects likely attributed to placebo responses, subjective perceptions, and ketosis-related metabolic adaptations. However, the CD may increase the risk of cardiovascular and renal complications, as well as micronutrient deficiencies, low fiber intake, and adverse lipid profile changes.

Due to limitations in the existing scientific evidence on CD, including the lack of control groups, short intervention durations, and small sample sizes, it is not possible to assess the long-term safety of CD. Thus, long-term adherence cannot be recommended.

Ascending aortic hemiarch reconstruction offers the same long-term benefits to patients over age 65 with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) as more complex extended arch reconstruction procedures, according to a study presented today at the 2026 Society of Thoracic Surgeons Annual Meeting.

The finding came from a risk-adjusted analysis of 3,562 patients examining long-term survival and surgical reintervention for aortic disease following initial operation for ATAAD. Patient data came from the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (ACSD), containing nearly 8.5 million adult cardiac surgery procedure records and linked to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services database. Of the ATAAD patients studied, 74.2% underwent aortic hemiarch replacement and 25.8% underwent extended arch reconstruction at a US hospital between July 2017 and December 2023.

Aortic dissection occurs when a tear in the inner lining of the aorta, the largest blood vessel in the body, allows blood to flow inside the aortic wall and "dissect" the layers apart, which dramatically increases the risk of aortic rupture and interruption of blood flow to the affected portions of the body. Acute dissections affecting the ascending aorta usually require emergency surgery, often in patients aged 65 or older. Cardiovascular surgeons have many options when planning surgery for these patients, said John R. Spratt, MD, clinical assistant professor of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at University of Florida Health, a center with one of the highest aortic surgery volumes in the nation. 

Ascending hemiarch replacement involves replacement of the ascending aorta and the underside of the first portion of the aortic arch and is considered to have lower operative risk and complexity compared with extended arch reconstruction. Extended arch reconstruction describes any procedure involving replacement of the ascending aorta, partial or total replacement of the transverse arch, and re-implantation of one or more arch vessels. Depending on the technique used, most extended arch reconstructions carry greater short-term operative risk due to the need for longer periods of cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiac arrest, and more advanced forms of cerebral protection that are needed during the procedure compared with ascending hemiarch reconstruction.

Patients with aortic dissection can require additional aortic operations later in life, even if the initial dissection repair was successful. Extended arch reconstruction may decrease the long-term risk of requiring additional open aortic surgery. However, older patients have a shorter overall life expectancy and the extent to which they can reap these benefits is unclear." 

 John R. Spratt, MD, clinical assistant professor of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, University of Florida Health

In the six years of data reviewed in the study, extended arch reconstruction for acute dissection in patients over the age of 65 did not confer any long-term advantage regarding survival or rates of undergoing additional aortic surgery compared to the hemiarch procedure.

 "It is important to balance what the 'ideal' reconstruction may be when reviewing a CT scan with the overall risk profile of an individual patient. Based on our analysis, most patients age 65 and older undergoing repair of acute dissection will be fine with hemiarch reconstruction and have the same long-term outcomes as they would with a higher-risk procedure," said Spratt.

The ACSD is part of the STS National Database, one of the largest and most comprehensive clinical registries with nearly 10 million cardiothoracic procedures performed by 4,300+ surgeons. With more than 95% of adult cardiac surgery procedures and the largest and most robust clinical thoracic surgical database in the US, data and outcomes from the STS Database provide true national benchmarks for clinical outcomes of cardiothoracic surgery.

An international research consortium, led by scientists at VIB and UGent, has developed a new platform that could change how antibody medicines are tested and brought to patients. The work, published in Science Immunology, highlights problems during conventional antibody drug testing and introduces a next-generation mouse model that makes it possible to predict the effects of antibody drugs in humans more accurately. 

Antibody-based medicines are widely used to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Many of these drugs look extremely promising during early testing. However, a large number later fail in clinical trials or show unexpected side effects. This slows down drug development, drives up costs, and can put patients at risk.

"Our new platform allows us to study antibody function in conditions that are much closer to what happens in patients," says Prof. Bart Lambrecht (VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research), senior author of the study. "That means we can make better, more confident decisions much earlier in drug development."

Before new medicines are tested in humans, they are studied in the laboratory, including in culture systems, lab mice, and non-human primates to estimate their effects and toxicities. These systems have been essential for medical progress, but new research shows they do not always reflect how the human immune system works, especially for antibody drugs.

Antibodies, particularly Immunoglobulin G (IgG), the blueprint for all approved therapeutic antibodies, do more than bind to a target. Their tail region, known as the Fc domain, sends instructions to the immune system. These instructions are read by Fc gamma (Fcγ) receptors on immune cells and determine whether immune cells kill infected or cancerous cells, remove harmful targets, or dampen inflammation.

The challenge is that these Fcγ receptors differ substantially between species. As a result, the same antibody can trigger very different immune responses depending on the biological system in which it is tested.

The study shows that the human immune system responds to antibody drugs in ways that are not always captured during early testing, with real-world consequences. In people, several immune cell types are highly responsive to, while in laboratory models these same responses are often much weaker or absent. Even more importantly, human platelets, the cells that control blood clotting, can be directly activated by certain antibodies. This mechanism does not exist in mice, meaning dangerous clotting risks can remain hidden during early testing. Other immune cells can also react in opposite ways depending on the system used.

Because of these differences, antibody drugs can appear safe or effective early on, only to behave very differently in patients. A well-known example is the development of anti-CD40L antibodies, which progressed to clinical trials after reassuring early results but later caused severe blood clots and patient deaths. These risks were not detected sooner because crucial human-specific immune interactions were invisible in standard preclinical studies.

To solve this problem, the researchers first created a detailed map showing how Fcγ receptors are distributed across immune cells in humans and commonly used testing systems. They then used this information to build a new mouse model that closely reflects how the human immune system handles antibodies. This ensures that antibodies interact with immune cells in a way that closely mirrors human immune biology, including how receptor expression changes during inflammation.

In contrast to existing humanized mouse models, this new model uses a more precise genetic 'knock-in' strategy and is made commercially available, guaranteeing access for academic researchers and drug developers alike.

The new platform has been rigorously validated across multiple disease settings. It enables researchers to reliably rank antibody candidates by true biological effectiveness, assess how well antibodies remove specific immune cells, and evaluate how antibodies limit disease progression for example in the context of cancer. These types of comparisons are difficult or impossible with conventional approaches.

According to dr. Karel Van Damme (VIB-UGent, UZ Gent), first author of the study, "Modern antibody development increasingly depends on subtle molecular fine-tuning. Our platform allows different antibody designs to be compared head-to-head in a biologically meaningful way, reducing guesswork."

Beyond its scientific importance, the platform offers major economic advantages for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Better early-stage predictability can reduce costly late-stage failures, shorten development timelines, and lower overall research and development costs.

At the same time, more accurate early evaluation supports improved patient safety. Antibody candidates with higher risk profiles can be identified sooner, while the most promising therapies can move forward with greater confidence.

The approach also aligns with evolving expectations from regulatory authorities. Agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) increasingly promote the use of advanced, more predictive models to strengthen evidence before clinical testing.

The work was carried out by an international partnership between academic and industry experts, including VIB-Ghent University, argenx (Belgium), genOway (France), and Innate Pharma (France).

As antibody medicines continue to play a growing role in healthcare, this new platform offers a clearer and safer path from laboratory research to real treatments, helping effective therapies reach patients faster and at lower cost.

Two Cambridge-led studies suggest that the psychological distress caused by lockdowns (UK) and experience of infection (US) was reduced among those of faith compared to non-religious people.  

People of religious faith may have experienced lower levels of unhappiness and stress than secular people during the UK's Covid-19 lockdowns in 2020 and 2021, according to a new University of Cambridge study released as a working paper.

The findings follow recently published Cambridge-led research suggesting that worsening mental health after experiencing Covid infection - either personally or in those close to you - was also somewhat ameliorated by religious belief. This study looked at the US population during early 2021.

University of Cambridge economists argue that - taken together - these studies show that religion may act as a bulwark against increased distress and reduced wellbeing during times of crisis, such as a global public health emergency.

Selection biases make the wellbeing effects of religion difficult to study. People may become religious due to family backgrounds, innate traits, or to cope with new or existing struggles."

Prof Shaun Larcom from Cambridge's Department of Land Economy, and co-author of the latest study

"However, the Covid-19 pandemic was an extraordinary event affecting everyone at around the same time, so we could gauge the impact of a negative shock to wellbeing right across society. This provided a unique opportunity to measure whether religion was important for how some people deal with a crisis."

Larcom and his Cambridge colleagues Prof Sriya Iyer and Dr Po-Wen She analyzed survey data collected from 3,884 people in the UK during the first two national lockdowns, and compared it to three waves of data prior to the pandemic.

They found that while lockdowns were associated with a universal uptick in unhappiness, the average increase in feeling miserable was 29% lower for people who described themselves as belonging to a religion.

The researchers also analyzed the data by "religiosity": the extent of an individual's commitment to religious beliefs, and how central it is to their life. Those for whom religion makes "some or a great difference" in their lives experienced around half the increase in unhappiness seen in those for whom religion makes little or no difference.

"The study suggests that it is not just being religious, but the intensity of religiosity that is important when coping with a crisis," said Larcom.

Those self-identifying as religious in the UK are more likely to have certain characteristics, such as being older and female. The research team "controlled" for these statistically to try and isolate the effects caused by faith alone, and still found that the probability of religious people having an increase in depression was around 20% lower than non-religious people.

There was little overall difference between Christians, Muslims and Hindus - followers of the three biggest religions in the UK. However, the team did find that wellbeing among some religious groups appeared to suffer more than others when places of worship were closed during the first lockdown.

"The denial of weekly communal attendance appears to have been particularly affecting for Catholics and Muslims," said Larcom.

For the earlier study, authored by Prof Sriya Iyer, along with colleagues Kishen Shastry, Girish Bahal and Anand Shrivastava from Australia and India, researchers used online surveys to investigate Covid-19 infections among respondents or their immediate family and friends, as well as religious beliefs, and mental health. 

The study was conducted during February and March 2021, and involved 5,178 people right across the United States, with findings published in the journal European Economic Review in November 2023.

Researchers found that almost half those who reported a Covid-19 infection either in themselves or their immediate social network experienced an associated reduction in wellbeing.

Where mental health declined, it was around 60% worse on average for the non-religious compared to people of faith with typical levels of "religiosity".

Interestingly, the positive effects of religion were not found in areas with strictest lockdowns, suggesting access to places of worship might be even more important in a US context. The study also found significant uptake of online religious services, and a 40% lower association between Covid-19 and mental health for those who used them.

"Religious beliefs may be used by some as psychological resources that can shore up self-esteem and add coping skills, combined with practices that provide social support," said Prof Iyer, from Cambridge's Faculty of Economics.

"The pandemic presented an opportunity to glean further evidence of this in both the United Kingdom and the United States, two nations characterised by enormous religious diversity." 

Added Larcom: "These studies show a relationship between religion and lower levels of distress during a global crisis. It may be that religious faith builds resilience, and helps people cope with adversity by providing hope, consolation and meaning in tumultuous times."

An updated report on cystic fibrosis (CF) from Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, in partnership with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), highlights the new national guidelines on CF newborn screening that aim to detect affected babies earlier, more accurately and more fairly.

CF is a genetic disorder that causes problems with digestion and breathing, impacting about 40,000 children and adults in the United States. Currently, newborns in every state are screened for CF. However, great variation in practice and the genetic panels used contributes to missed and delayed diagnosis, which leads to worse outcomes.

Delays more often occur in diagnosis of infants who are Black, Hispanic, or Asian, in part because these groups tend to have CF-causing gene variants that are rarer and seldom included in the newborn screening panels. These infants frequently screen negative and get diagnosed much later when they exhibit symptoms.

"The new recommendations are designed to improve detection of CF in babies from all racial and ethnic backgrounds," said report co-author and co-senior author on the CF guidelines Susanna McColley, MD, an internationally recognized expert in CF newborn screening, pediatric pulmonologist at Lurie Children's and Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. "The recommendations also aim to shorten time from birth to diagnosis and treatment, which has been shown to improve health for babies with CF."

The recent CF report shows steady progress in identifying the illness earlier, within the first 28 days of life. In 2014, 40 percent of infants with CF were first seen for testing after this optimal timeframe. By 2024, the percentage dropped to 33 percent.

The improved timeliness in evaluation for CF is encouraging. However, we still see delays in a third of the cases, so more needs to be done to increase awareness among families and primary care providers that earlier diagnosis dramatically improves symptoms and ultimately survival."

Dr. Susanna McColley, MD, pediatric pulmonologist at Lurie Children's and Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine

The report cites evidence that babies with CF who are diagnosed in the first two weeks of life have better nutrition at 1 and 5 years of age than babies who are diagnosed during the second month of life.

"Better nutrition means better growth and development for babies with CF, and with that comes better lung function and less severe disease trajectory," said Dr. McColley. "We urge parents to work with their child's pediatric care provider to assure diagnostic evaluation for CF within a few days of a positive newborn screening test for CF, so that treatment can begin as soon as possible if their baby has CF."

Dr. McColley also cautioned that CF newborn screening results can be false-negative, especially in infants who are Black or Asian. "Infants of any race or background showing clinical signs of CF, including bowel obstruction and growth faltering, should be referred for diagnostic evaluation even if the newborn screening results are normal," she said.

The final weekend of January saw some of the best performances of the season from U.S. men's national team players, with some looking to find form ahead of the 2026 World Cup while others took major career steps. 

Although the USMNT's most important player, Christian Pulisic has yet to rekindle his early season form with AC Milan, others have shown immense progress as the American player pool develops through the 2025–26 campaign.

The latest week saw plenty of Americans stand out in the final week of the Champions League league phase, as well as in their domestic leagues, while MLS players continued to approach their upcoming campaigns with ongoing preseason camps across Europe, South America and the U.S. 

Here, Sports Illustrated ranks the top four performances of the week from American players across the globe.

Gianluca Busio isn't in the running to make the 2026 World Cup squad, but at 23 years old, he has the potential to be a player of the future of the USMNT. This weekend saw him score his fifth goal of the season in Venezia's 2–1 win over Carrarese in Serie B action as he continues a strong campaign. 

With 17 USMNT caps to his name, the step down to Serie B after relegation last year has allowed him to develop as an attacker, potentially setting him up for further success in the seasons to come. 

Boasting five goals and an assist in 21 matches so far in 2025–26, Busio has played a key role in Venezia's success as they sit atop the division with 47 points through 22 matches, eyeing promotion in the coming months. 

A former Sporting Kansas City starlet, Busio is in the final five months of his contract with the Italian side.

The presumed starting striker for the USMNT this summer, Folarin Balogun had a heavy week with a scoreless draw against Weston McKennie's Juventus in the Champions League, followed by a 4–0 win over Rennes in Ligue 1 action. 

While he struggled to make a significant impact in the Champions League, he helped set up two goals against Rennes, picking up an assist on Ansu Fati's opening strike in the 33rd minute. 

Although he wasn't extremely present in front of the goal, his ability to drop deeper and set up each of Fati and fellow winger, Aleksandr Golovin showed his adaptability as a playmaker in a central attacking role. 

Despite a productive match, Balogun had to leave in the 56th minute with hamstring tightness, a worrying sign for the next few weeks leading into the March friendlies with the USMNT. 

Malik Tillman's return to the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen has had its ups and downs this season, but he had an outstanding week, scoring three goals across two matches.

To start, the American bagged a brace against Villarreal in the Champions League to help his side move on in the competition with a 16th-place finish in the league phase, before playing a key role and finding the back of the net in his side's 3–1 win over Frankfurt on Saturday. 

Both matches saw him play as a right-sided attacking midfielder, where he made late runs into the box and quick linkups with a mix of attacking partners, including Ibrahim Maza and Patrik Schick against Villarreal, and Martin Terrier and Christian Kofane against Frankfurt. 

While he likely won't maintain scoring more than a goal per game, the uptick in attacking form will be welcome news for Pochettino, with the USMNT looking to bolster further attacking midfield options alongside Christian Pulisic, who has started to slow down with Milan.

Weston McKennie still doesn't have a contract beyond 2026 with Juventus, but given how he has played, that seems bound to change. This week, the 27-year-old star continued to showcase his stellar form with his third goal of the Serie A season in a 4–1 win over Parma, following up a strong showing in a scoreless draw against Monaco to advance in the Champions League. 

The goal against Parma marked his fourth in all competitions since the calendar flipped to 2026 and helped the Bianconeri to fourth in the Serie A table, extending a consistent rise under manager Luciano Spalletti. 

McKennie started centrally in the win over Parma, playing as a near false-nine compared to the wider roles he has played for the majority of this season. The adjustment came less than a week after Spalletti called him a potential “perfect striker,” following a win over Napoli. 

The performance saw him continue to make the most of a flourishing partnership with fellow North American Jonathan David, while mustering two chances created and three shots. David, meanwhile, found his fourth goal and third assist in the last seven matches. 

McKennie's versatility and continued standout play can only be good news for everyone involved. For Juventus, their hopes of Champions League play in 2026–27 continued, while McKennie made his case for a new contract. As for the USMNT, he'll hope to bring that form into March and to the World Cup.

Jean-Philippe Mateta's proposed move to AC Milan from Crystal Palace has collapsed, according to reports. The Eagles striker had first been in talks with Nottingham Forest but was closing in on a move to Italy; at the last minute, however, the Serie A side have pulled the plug. Milan have opted to walk away after medical checks revealed a knee problem.

Mateta was close to moving to Milan, with the Serie A club reaching a preliminary agreement with Palace over the weekend. That came as something of a hijack, as Nottingham Forest had also been attempting to sign the France international. Now, though, the deal has fallen through, per Sky, with Milan opting against continuing after running medical checks on the striker. 

This is despite the fact that Palace manager Oliver Glasner opted against selecting Mateta at the weekend, insisting he was not in the right frame of mind. 

He said: "It is nothing to do right now with the transfers. He is not in the [right] place. To play makes no sense. 

“We have to protect the team and I have to protect him. That is why he will not travel with us to Nottingham.”

He added: "Again, there is so much noise, so much speculation, so many things going on. We need every single player at their best and JP [Mateta] isn't at his best right now with all the noise that happens.

"It can be football noise, but if someone has private issues where they can't focus on football, then it makes no sense to play. He can't help the team and perform at his top level. We decided it is better not to play him."

Mateta has been playing regularly for Palace this season and has made 23 Premier League appearances, scoring eight goals. He played 85 minutes against Chelsea in the fixture prior to the most recent weekend, but Sacha Tavolieri reports that Mateta's medical showed up an issue that will require surgery to fix, and could lead to the striker being out for as many as four months.

Palace have also been linked with Jorgen Strand Larsen of Wolves, and have bid for the striker, but it is unclear if his future will be affected by the collapse of Mateta's move.

Mateta has revealed his dream of playing in the World Cup, which may well see him put off surgery until after the tournament. 

He told Palace's website: “I'm very proud of myself. I'm very happy, and I think I deserve it, because I train very hard, with the gaffer [Oliver Glasner] as well and all the team. It's a dream come true, and I hope I will get called up again.

“It's my dream too, to go to the World Cup. I will do everything to go there. But first, you have to do a good job with Crystal Palace – every day, every game.

“I'm a very ambitious guy, and when I think about something, I try to do everything to make it come true.”

Mateta has also credited Oliver Glasner with his transformation, adding: “I think it's on him. He used to train in Germany, and when he came in, [in terms of] how we need to play I think I understood, because I'm from the German league too.

“I think it's because I play many games in the role. I think that's why people say I'm improving my hold-up play – because I know it very well now.

“I train hard every day, and I want to play every game and show him I'm ready for him, for the team, for the staff. I show them that I want to play every game.

“I think it's not only me personally, but we have a fantastic team that believes in everyone. We're just training very hard and believing in ourselves, and on the pitch we've had the results.

“I hope we will keep thinking the same and keep working hard.”

At its 30th Anniversary Celebration, the U.S. Soccer Foundation honored the USA's 1994 World Cup coach Bora Milutinovic and Kenneth C. Griffin, the foundation's most impactful philanthropist.

Griffin, the founder and CEO of Citadel and the founder of Griffin Catalyst, was recognized for his support, which has created 100 mini‑pitches throughout Chicago and Miami — turning schoolyards and neighborhood spaces into hubs for more than 100,000 kids and families. He received the No. 10 Award.

More than 850 mini-pitches have been created across the nation by the U.S. Soccer Foundation, which was set up as a perpetual foundation with the 1994 World Cup surplus of over $50 million ($111 million in 2025 dollars).

Liverpool have reportedly beaten Premier League rivals Chelsea to the signing of highly-rated Rennes defender Jeremy Jacquet. The Reds are said to have a £60 million ($82m) deal in place. The talented 20-year-old is considered to be a long-term addition at Anfield, with a big money agreement set to be completed in the summer transfer window.

Terms have been thrashed out at this stage, as the winter market prepares to close for business. Sky Sports are among those to report on how Jacquet will make his way to Merseyside ahead of the 2026-27 campaign.

It is said that the transfer package pieced together by Liverpool is worth £55m ($75m) as a guaranteed fee, with a further £5m made up in potential add-ons. Personal terms with the player are yet to be agreed, but they are “not expected to be an issue”.

The France Under-21 international is a product of Rennes' academy system and has taken in 18 appearances for the Ligue 1 outfit this season. A string of eye-catching performances have brought him to the attention of leading sides across Europe.

Jacquet has been registering on the radar at Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea considered to be leading the chase for his signature at one stage. The Blues are said to have held talks with the player and his representatives, but they will “not match Liverpool's bid”.

Sky Sports claims that “Chelsea offered exactly the same deal as Liverpool but over the past 48 hours, when it became apparent that Mamadou Sarr would be returning to Chelsea and Josh Acheampong was staying, the player changed his mind and decided to move to Liverpool”.

Jacquet is said to favour a move to Anfield as he is more likely to see regular game time with Liverpool. Chelsea's squad is already loaded with promising center backs, meaning that competition for places will be fierce.

The Blues currently have Trevoh Chalobah, Wesley Fofana, Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Axel Disasi, Aaron Anselmino and Jorrel Hato in their first-team squad, while England international Levi Colwill will return from an ACL injury by next season and Sarr is seeing a loan spell at Strasbourg cut short.

Liverpool, in contrast, are short on options at the heart of their back four. Joe Gomez and Giovanni Leoni are injured at present, while France international Ibrahima Konate is seeing his contract run down towards free agency. Club captain Virgil van Dijk will turn 35 in July.

Arne Slot had been hoping to add Marc Guehi to his ranks, as his deal ran down at Crystal Palace, but Manchester City stepped in and paid a fee for the 25-year-old in the winter window - forcing the Reds to look elsewhere.

Jacquet is considered to be a shrewd addition for Liverpool as he boasts the potential to become a key asset for the short and long-term future. His game can be taken to even greater heights.

French football expert Julien Laurens has told Sky Sports of Jacquet, with the youngster being compared to established stars on the books at Arsenal and Chelsea: “He's the real deal. I know he's only 20, he hasn't played for France and he hasn't played in the Champions League or Europa League.

“He has a long way to go but he's been impressive last season, after they [Rennes] called him back from his loan in the second division, and this season, with Habib Beye.

“You can't get it wrong. He is going to be amazing. He reminds me of when William Saliba burst onto the scene in France with Saint-Etienne, or Wesley Fofana.

“It's about how much you value that potential and talent. You would pay a lot of money for someone who hasn't really proved much. It's a lot of money for such a young player.”

Liverpool will hope to have Champions League football to offer Jacquet when his transfer is completed. They continue to compete for European glory this season and sit sixth in the Premier League table with 14 top-flight fixtures left to take in.

International Football

WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 05: Gianni Infantino, President of FIFA, speaks during the FIFA World Cup 2026 Official Draw at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on December 05, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jia Haocheng - Pool/Getty Images) Pool

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has spoken out against banning Russia and Israel from international football — and also defended awarding U.S. President Donald Trump the FIFA Peace Prize in December.

Both FIFA, the world governing body, and its European counterpart UEFA banned the Russian national team from competing in 2022 after the country invaded Ukraine. There have been calls for FIFA and UEFA to impose a similar ban on Israel because of the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the country's support of settlements in Palestinian territories.

Although Russia's ban is yet to be lifted, Infantino claimed it “has not achieved anything” and revealed he will be looking at removing the ban, as well as potentially changing FIFA's statutes to prevent similar sanctions in the future.

Infantino was speaking in an hour-long, in-person interview with Yalda Hakim, host of The World on Sky News, which was released online on Monday afternoon.

“We have to,” Infantino responded when asked whether he is going to explore lifting the ban. “Definitely. Because this ban has not achieved anything, it has just created more frustration and hatred.”

On the possibility of changing FIFA's statutes to stop national teams being banned, Infantino said they “should actually never ban any country from playing football because of the acts of their political leaders”.

In 2023, FIFA and UEFA lifted bans on Russia Under-17 teams from participating in international tournaments across the men's and women's game, provided they competed as the “Football Union of Russia”, and in the absence of their national flag, their national anthem, their national-team kit and equipment, and played in neutral colours.

In October, Amnesty International, the global human rights organisation, wrote an open letter to FIFA and UEFA to “suspend the Israeli Football Association until clubs from settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are removed from its leagues”.

The letter also argued that “football cannot be separated from Israel's unlawful occupation”, although Infantino told Sky News that implementing a ban on Israel “is a defeat”.

In a wide-ranging interview, the FIFA president defended handing Trump the FIFA Peace Prize ahead of the men's World Cup draw in Washington at the beginning of December.

“Whatever we can do to help peace in the world, we should be doing it, and for this reason, for some time we were thinking about (whether) we should do something to reward people who do something,” Infantino said of the award, before insisting that “objectively, he (Trump) deserves it”.

“It's not just Gianni Infantino who said it… (there's) a Nobel Peace Prize winner (Maria Corina Machado) who said this. He was instrumental in resolving conflicts and saving thousands of lives.”

Corina Machado, the leader of the opposition in Venezuela, presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Trump during a meeting at the White House on Jan. 15, saying it was “a recognition for his unique commitment (to) our freedom”.

Corina Machado's visit to Washington came weeks after Trump ordered U.S. forces to seize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro his wife, Cilia Flores, in a military operation in Caracas. Maduro and Flores were brought to the U.S. and have been charged in a drug-trafficking case.

Infantino was also pressed on the calls for countries to boycott this year's World Cup due to concerns relating to Trump's rhetoric around invading Greenland and his domestic immigration policies.

The FIFA president dismissed that narrative and said nobody has suggested cutting diplomatic ties with the United States, essentially asking why football should be treated differently.

“I think, in our divided world, in our aggressive world, we need occasions where people can come, can meet around the passion (for football).”

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' office is calling the next three years “the most intensive and exciting three-year period of major sporting events that any city in the world has ever experienced” as the city prepares for a full slate of global competitions. Bass is set to deliver a State of the City address Monday to outline her administration's priorities for the year ahead — and beyond.

“The State of the City will reflect on this moment and serve as a unifying celebration of Los Angeles, the city that we love and it's people, neighborhoods and cultures,” the mayor's office said.

The first major sporting event to touch down in the City of Angels is this summer's FIFA World Cup. SoFi Stadium is set to host several matches, including two U.S. Men's National Team group stage outings, two Round of 32 matchups and a quarterfinal showdown.

The World Cup final is set for July 19 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, just outside New York City.

In 2027, Super Bowl LXI will be hosted at SoFi. It will be the second time the Big Game has been held there — Super Bowl LVI, between the Rams and Bengals, took place at SoFi in 2022 — and it will be the ninth Super Bowl to be hosted in the Greater Los Angeles area. 2027 also marks the first year the Super Bowl will be broadcast on ESPN.

 California union believes Waymos should be off the streets 

The biggest sporting event in the world comes to L.A. in 2028: the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The games will attract visitors from around the world and make use of the Greater L.A. area's many stadiums and facilities. Mayor Bass has promised a “car-free Olympics,” although some Angelenos are skeptical of how attainable that goal is.

Bass is set to give her State of the City address on Wednesday afternoon at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Another speech is planned for mid-April; this address, according to the L.A. Times, will be more of a traditional State of the City address and focus heavily on the mayor's budget and spending priorities.

With less than six months until kickoff, Guardian readers share their experiences of buying World Cup tickets – or deciding not to 

The 2026 World Cup in the US, Mexico and Canada is less than six months away. Fifa's ticketing process has been met with demand and controversy. Security concerns for fans traveling to the US have risen.

We asked readers to share their experiences of buying World Cup tickets – or deciding not to. These are some of the stories we received.

When President Trump placed aggressive tariffs on Canadian exports, I completely swore off travel to the United States. So, when Fifa selected me during the “Domestic Exclusivity” phase, I leapt at the opportunity to buy tickets to a match in Canada. Each step of the online process was somewhat confusing, including a counter-clockwise circular countdown with imperceptibly slow movement and multiple login requests. Nevertheless, after a 90-minute wait, I was able to purchase tickets for my family to Canada's last group game. They cost $270 (Canadian) each. The price was high, but that's just the reality for North American sports today. There are tickets at that price and above for every NFL or NHL game. The price of the hotel I booked outside Vancouver was far more shocking. John, Winnipeg, Canada

I went to the World Cup in Germany in 2006 when I lived in the UK, and always wanted to go to another in my lifetime. I now live in Australia, and being conscious of the fact that I'd be receiving a decent tax rebate from the Aussie government, had decided to spend that on flying me and the missus to the World Cup taking in some games in the US and Mexico and was registered for tickets and a rough itinerary planned. However that decision all changed as I watched the clown show, clusterfuck of the Trump/Infantino White House press conferences, alongside the news of the appalling treatment of immigrants and tourists in the US. I've basically decided that not a cent of my money will go to making the tournament a success for either of those odious pricks. Instead I'll spend the money on taking in the Ashes, the Rugby World Cup and a few decent gigs/music festivals in the Australia, helping the local economy here. Adam, 53, Brisbane, Australia

I spent $14,400 on tickets to nine games (a total of 32 tickets). Six group games, two round of 32 and one round of 16.

I am expecting that the majority of my tickets will be taken by friends and family traveling from the UK – I only intend to attend two to three games personally. Do I think it'll be worth it? No. I think it is crazy to spend $500 per ticket for a football game, especially given so many of the group games will be between countries that would not have qualified for a 32-team World Cup. However, with games “local” to me, it still feels more accessible than 2030 or 2034. I attended the World Cup in 2010 and spent £800 on tickets in total, including the quarter-final, semi-final and final. I went to Brazil 2014 (but was only able to get tickets for one game) and Russia 2018, but skipped 2022. Prices for 2026 are out of control but the risk of waiting in the hope ticket prices crash (as they did for the Club World Cup) closer to the time was not a risk I was willing to take. Tom F, Long Island

I bought four tickets for a group game in Philadelphia. I got selected in the Fifa lottery and the process itself to buy the tickets was pretty straightforward. I wanted tickets for a New York game as it's closer to me but the Category 3 & 4 tickets were not available and the Category 2 tickets were too expensive. I ended up paying $155 each for four tickets. It's a big outlay but unfortunately any event in the States is just going to be expensive.

I have had a bit of buyer's remorse at times about getting the tickets but it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see a World Cup game. Despite all the ridiculousness around it, once the games start it is still the most pure form of the sport around.

Obviously the situation with ICE is worrying. I work in construction so I've met a lot of Colombian & Ecuadorean people who would love to go to these games but, can they be sure they will be not be hassled going to game even if they are in the USA legitimately? Will fans from those countries want to travel even though they are some of the teams who have bought the most color to recent World Cups? Even neutral Latin & Central Americans would probably love to see it but will they want to deal with the hassle of going to a game? And that's before you get to the question of cost. John, Irishman living in New York

I have bought 62 tickets. Spent approximately $70,000. I do think it will be worth it as they can be resold. It's also, in my opinion, the best sporting event and only comes around twice a decade. Yes, there were obstacles, but all challenges in life are opportunities. Sameer Somal, entrepreneur, New York

Miami is absolutely not ready for a World Cup. The city has no real public transportation, the roads are a mess on a normal day, and the infrastructure is nowhere near capable of handling an event of this scale.

And honestly, I'm not buying tickets. Fifa is a corrupt organization that has never cared about fans or human rights – only profit. The last World Cup proved that.

To make things even worse, the atmosphere in the US under the Trump administration is frightening. Brown people – including myself – live with the fear of being targeted simply because of our skin. It's hard to celebrate a global event when basic safety and dignity are on the line. Antonio Gomez Berumen, Miami

Living in Toronto, it's been a life's dream for me to attend a World Cup match and I was very excited with the prospect of a World Cup happening in the US, Canada and Mexico. Two things have tempered my optimism: first, Donald Trump and the current state of the United States. It is quite evident that the current dispensation does not want outsiders in the country – more so, outsiders who look like me (brown and Indian). At this current stage, I don't think I will take the risk of going to the US to watch a match. That leaves very few matches to be held in Toronto. I have signed up for all the Fifa draws so far, waiting in queue for hours only to be told that I have been ‘entered' in a draw. Till now, I have not heard any positive news. I would love to watch a football World Cup match – any match, honestly – and I understand that it may not be cheap which is why I've started trying from so early. But I am getting frustrated and I don't think I will be able to get tickets after all – I don't think I can afford the astronomical prices that I see floating around. Angikaar Choudhury, 35, Toronto

I bought my World Cup 2026 tickets during the Early Visa Draw. In total I've spent over $7,000 so far. The process was stressful – at one point I waited almost 40 minutes just to get into the system, and by the time I got in, many of the major matches like the semi-finals and the final were already gone. The prices in general were quite high, but I still wanted to secure the games I cared about. Even with all the difficulties, I'm really excited. I'll be in the US for my summer holiday, and I can't wait to attend the matches in New York and Miami. For me, this feels like a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Cansu, Türkiye

I won't be buying tickets. Even though travel would be very easy for me as an American citizen, and both of my sisters live in host cities (NYC and Dallas), so lodging wouldn't be an issue. And yet, I'm just so disgusted with the Trump administration and the way “Johnny” was cozied up to him, and with the extortionate ticket prices, and the looming threat of ICE – it's just impossible to support. And it's really upsetting, because I have a five-year-old son and this should be a core memory for him. But in the end I think I'll save up the money and use it to take him to a game at the Emirates instead. Although, I wouldn't completely rule out one of the Mexican venues next summer … Alex, Montana

This has been beyond stressful. Between family and friends we've had about 10 accounts across the UK and USA trying in the presale draws and got nothing.

We did manage to get extremely lucky that our credit card company (Wells Fargo) had a draw so we had about 15-20 devices trying to login and my husband got us four tickets for the round of 16 in Houston for $2,000. Our kids will be six and 10 and we can only hope we get really lucky and England will be playing. We're still trying to get tickets for the Kansas City quarter-final as it's the closest game to where we live (a 10-hour drive).

Major major obstacles, London 2012 was so much simpler! Claire, Colorado

I naively thought getting at least one pair of World Cup tickets would be as manageable as getting tickets for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. Surely, I thought, If I could manage to figure out the IOC's ticketing system and attended a ton of Olympic events with face value tickets, then surely purchasing one pair of tickets to a local World Cup would be somewhat achievable. I was wrong. I was very wrong.

I applied for every single ticketing opportunity and failed each time. It's been easier to find the Aurora Borealis in our neighborhood than it is to find someone who managed to win the World Cup lottery – not one of my friends/family/co-workers/neighbors/community members managed to snag tickets.

I admit the frustration of being unable to attend a local World Cup game has dampened my enthusiasm for the event a bit. I still haven't given up hope and have joined every available promotional contest and event to try to get a pair of those tickets. And I have also been keeping an eye on the secondary market in case some fair priced tickets magically pop up. But I've also come to accept that if it doesn't happen, then it doesn't. I'll be perfectly happy to enjoy the World Cup in the comfort of my home, at my local sports bar, or at a neighborhood watch party – the places where all the real local fans will be this World Cup. Rex, Richmond, Canada

My family and I bought tickets. We spent $800 for four tickets, and plan to buy two more (for which we have budgeted another $800).

The ticket lotteries had us stressed that all the tickets would be gone by the time the general sale started. So when my mother-in-law was drawn for one of the pre-sale right-to-buy contests, we bought tickets right away. Since my mother-in-law, who is older, was the one who won the drawing, we needed to coach her over FaceTime on how to buy the tickets. She was quickly getting overwhelmed, especially because the ticket prices seemed to be changing but the second (as other more tech savvy winners bought up the cheap seats). We needed tickets on [26 June], since that was the date we were all able to get off work and school. The game ended up being Egypt-Iran. It is exciting to get to see Mo Salah play in person, but I would be lying if I wasn't a bit disappointed to not get France or Brazil, or another “bigger” footballing country.

With all of that said, we still think it will be worth it – seeing high-level football like the World Cup is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for football fans in a non-footballing country like the US. I completely understand why my fellow American soccer fans are willing to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to see games. Paul, Illinois

After surviving a health scare, it has been a dream of mine to go to a World Cup final. For Qatar 2022 I wasn't well enough and I wasn't too keen on the chosen location for the World Cup. I'd pencilled in 2026's final in New York as my plan. I was organised, I booked accommodation two years in advance to be in New York over the final.

Everything was in place, we just needed tickets. We knew these would be expensive and have managed to save about $1,000AUD each for final tickets. We'd probably even go to $1,200AUD each if we had to and we based these estimations on the last final in Qatar with the cheapest final tickets there being $900AUD. Then [in December], the prices came out. Cheapest ticket for the final is roughly $6,250AUD each. Or $13,000AUD for the both of us. We don't have that kind of money.

What was a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, a dream after years of illness and not being able to work has been squashed by Fifa's insistence of making as much money as possible, of Infantino's disregard for the real football fan that puts their entire life savings at risk. It's disgusting. We will go to New York. We will have a great time in a great city. We've booked the flights and accommodation. But we won't be going to the final I've dreamt of purely because Fifa and Infantino need to make more money on top of all the money they already have. We are devastated. Jon Hewitt, 42, Australia

I have purchased some tickets, but not as many as I'd like. I'm frustrated about how Fifa is handling their ticket offerings for those who use a wheelchair.

[Regarding hospitality seats] I asked On Location whether I could buy a wheelchair seat [space], and they said I had to buy a regular seat, then call them and let them know I wanted a wheelchair space, and they would try to accommodate. But their email specifically said, “please note, while we will do our best to accommodate your request, this is not a guarantee.” So I have to spend $2,000-$5,000 on a ticket, and they can't even guarantee that I can use it. (I am unlikely to buy Hospitality seats because of the cost, but I'm still disappointed that the option doesn't exist for those with accessibility needs.) I asked Fifa Collect if I could exercise a RTB to get a wheelchair seat. Their response was “Unfortunately we do not handle this. After you buy your ticket you should address to Fifa Ticketing direct in order for them to assist you.” So once again, I'd have to spend a lot of money up front, with no guarantee that I'll get a usable seat. I actually had a RTB but ended up selling it because it was useless to me.

I have had two shots at buying tickets, the Visa pre-sale and the Early Access Draw. In both cases companion seats (a regular seat next to the wheelchair space) were all gone early. By the time my purchasing time slot came up, there were still wheelchair spaces available for many of the games, but no companion seats. I think that's because Fifa lets you buy up to three companion seats for each wheelchair seat. So the companion seats were sold out much more quickly than the wheelchair seats. By letting early buyers get three companion seats, those seats run out by the time later buyers get online, forcing wheelchair users to attend games on their own.

[As of 22 January] I have continued to ping Fifa about how to get a companion seat next to a wheelchair seat. They finally responded that I should just purchase two wheelchair seats: one for the wheelchair user, and one for the companion. I have no idea if this strategy will work, but that's what I've done for the upcoming Random Selection Draw. We'll see. Jeff, 67, Santa Cruz, California

KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) Embassy in Jamaica is inviting applications from locals wishing to attend the upcoming 2026 World Cup.

In a post on X, the embassy said the US is prepared to welcome visitors from around the world to the greatest FIFA World Cup 2026 in history.

“Be a part of history and apply for your US visa today! All visa applicants need to meet all eligibility requirements under US law,” the embassy said.

The World Cup will be held in a cross-continent showing, in Mexico, Canada and the United States. Record ticket requests have already been generated for the event

Some social media users have expressed uncertainty online about attending US matches, citing an ongoing immigration crackdown in the country, while multiple football executives including former FIFA president Sepp Blatter have supported a proposed fan boycott.

Tensions have been heightened by US President Donald Trump's repeated comments about anexxing Greenland.

Trump on the other hand has expressed confidence that this World Cup will be the best in history.

The goals kept coming for three USMNT stars at the weekend, while one American manager continued to make headlines for his unbeaten start to life in Spain.

“We didn't start the year so well, but I think we're slowly finding our feet again.”

Malik Tillman's assessment of Bayer Leverkusen's improving fortunes could just as well apply to his own spell at the Bundesliga club.

Arriving in a €35million (£30m/$41m) summer deal, the USMNT midfielder was given the departing Florian Wirtz's No 10 shirt and tasked with somehow replacing the German's considerable influence.

At times during his first few months at the club, that burden of responsibility seemed to weigh heavily.

It was not helped by Leverkusen firing the manager who signed him, Erik ten Hag, after just two league games in charge.

Leverkusen looked some way off the side that finished first and second in their previous two campaigns. Like everyone at the club, Tillman was affected by the tumult.

But the 23-year-old did not take too long to find his feet. That testing autumn came and went, with an injury causing him to miss three league games and a 7-2 thrashing in the Champions League by PSV.

But he marked his return to the starting line-up on November 22 with a goal against Wolfsburg in a 3-1 win, and began to show his talent consistently thereafter.

Last week, he repeated a feat he achieved when he became the first American to score twice in a Champions League game. This time, he struck two goals as Leverkusen beat Villarreal 3-0 and booked their place in the competition's play-off stage (and a double-header against Greek side Olympiacos).

Just to underline how he is flourishing, Tillman scored again on Saturday and was in good spirits after the game against Eintracht Frankfurt.

“It's about time I scored more often,” he told the club website after that third goal in two games. “We didn't start the year so well, but I think we're slowly finding our feet again. And every win obviously boosts our confidence. Hopefully it continues like this.”

Tillman's confidence is peaking and his admiring manager did not hold back with his praise.

“He's a top player,” boss Kasper Hjulmand told German newspaper Bild. “He has superb technique, he's intelligent. Now he's fully arrived.”

Another American who has emerged as a force for his club after a big summer move is Patrick Agyemang.

The 25-year-old has had a swift rise from college soccer in Rhode Island four years ago to the highly competitive English second tier in the summer.

And he has taken it all in his stride. After grabbing attention in the MLS with Charlotte, he has impressed in England's Championship and on Friday scored his ninth league goal of the season for promotion-chasing Derby County in a 5-0 win at Bristol City.

That tally may well have played the 6ft 4in (193cm) forward back into contention for the USMNT roster for their friendly with Belgium in March after missing November's wins over Paraguay and Uruguay.

Weston McKennie is at a different stage of his career to Tillman and Agyemang.

The 27-year-old has already proven himself for club and country, and has played in the Premier League, Bundesliga and Serie A.

But he is far from resting on his laurels. McKennie is one of the Italian top flight's most in-form players, and stamped his influence on the Champions League with three goals in consecutive games during the group phase.

On Sunday, he scored again in Juventus' 4-1 win over Parma. And he was quick to credit manager Luciano Spalletti with being a big influence.

“Spalletti is unique, as I have never in my career worked with a coach like this,” he told DAZN Italy. “He is so good, works with the team spirit. I'm really happy and I think everyone here is happy to be working with him.”

In France's Ligue 1, Folarin Balogun got an assist as Monaco beat Rennes 4-0 at Stade Louis II.

The USMNT striker could do with increasing his domestic scoring rate, though. He hasn't scored in the league for Monaco since November, even if he has managed some crucial goals in their Champions League campaign.

In Germany, it's DFB-Pokal time. See if Tillman can continue his impressive form when Leverkusen take on James Sands' St Pauli in the cup quarter-final (Tuesday, 2:45pm ET, ESPN+)

Joe Scally has been a regular for Borussia Monchengladbach, where injury is again restricting Gio Reyna. The former will hope to be influential as his team faces Tillman and Leverkusen on Saturday in the Bundesliga (12:30pm, ESPN+).

Tune in next Monday to see if Alex Freeman, who joined Villarreal from Orlando City last week, can make his La Liga debut against Espanyol (Monday, 3pm, ESPN+). He was an unused sub for his new club in their draw with Osasuna on Saturday.

Staying with Spain, it is worth keeping an eye on Real Sociedad. They face Osasuna in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals on Tuesday, and their American manager Pellegrino Matarazzo is having a strong start to life at his new club.

Last week, Matarazzo was named manager of the month for January after a five-game unbeaten spell as boss, which has seen La Real take 10 points out of a possible 12 in La Liga. The run has included a victory over leaders Barcelona. See if he can keep that up in the cup (Tuesday, 3pm, ESPN app).

Finally, Christian Pulisic and Milan are back in Serie A action tomorrow against Bologna (Tuesday, 2:45pm, Paramount +).

Tyrell Malacia's nightmare spell at Manchester United has taken a chaotic and bitter turn after the club blocked his proposed exit to Turkey while he was literally waiting to board his flight. The Dutch defender has been left "furious" and in a state of total disbelief by the 11th-hour U-turn from technical director Jason Wilcox, which traps him at Old Trafford despite him having no apparent prospect of first-team football.

According to a bombshell report from Dutch outlet Voetbal International, the 26-year-old left-back was at the airport, luggage in hand and preparing to fly to Istanbul to finalise a loan move, when his phone rang.

On the other end of the line was United technical director Jason Wilcox. In a move that has stunned the player's camp, Wilcox reportedly informed Malacia that the transfer was off and ordered him not to board the plane.

The intervention came at the absolute final moment. Malacia had been given the green light to travel and complete his medical with the Turkish club, understood to be a temporary switch to restart his career, only for the Old Trafford hierarchy to change their minds abruptly. The defender was forced to turn around and head back to Manchester, leaving his transfer hopes in tatters.

The reaction from the player's side has been one of incandescent rage. VI describes the mood as one of "disbelief" and "anger." Malacia had spent the days leading up to the deadline negotiating his exit, believing he had the full blessing of the club to leave in search of regular minutes.

To be pulled back from the departure gate is seen as a humiliating blow for a player who has already endured a torrid couple of years. Malacia has fought his way back from a devastating knee injury that kept him sidelined for over 18 months, only to find himself completely frozen out of the first-team picture upon his return. He was loaned to PSV for the second half of last season but started only six of the 12 games in which he appeared. 

He viewed a move to the Turkish Super Lig as a vital lifeline for a player seeking a chance to prove his fitness and get competitive miles in his legs away from the intense scrutiny of the Premier League. The sudden revocation of that permission, without a clear sporting justification communicated beforehand, has reportedly severed whatever trust remained between the player and the club's decision-makers.

The decision to block the move is all the more baffling given Malacia's standing in the squad. Since returning to fitness, he has not featured for the senior side, with the coaching staff preferring other options at left-back. With Luke Shaw fit and other versatile defenders available, Malacia was deemed surplus to requirements until the phone call at the airport.

With Patrick Dorgu out with an injury, the Red Devils opted to keep the Dutchman in case they need cover. With Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui preferred ahead of Malacia at left-back, though, he is not expected to see much of an increase in his playing time. The 26-year-old has made just one appearance for the senior side all season, clocking just two minutes in the 1-0 win against Newcastle.

For Malacia, this U-turn represents a crushing professional setback. After losing a significant chunk of his career to a complex meniscus injury and subsequent surgeries, he desperately needs match rhythm. Staying at United to sit in the stands or play occasional minutes for the Under-21s does nothing to restore his value or his confidence.

The Turkish transfer window remains open until February 6, so there may be a faint glimmer of hope that this deal could be resurrected if cooler heads prevail in the coming days. However, the nature of the blockage, suggests a definitive decision has been made to keep him.

Unless the situation changes rapidly, Malacia faces the prospect of spending the next five months rotting on the bench at Old Trafford, a "prisoner" of a contract that the club suddenly decided was too valuable to release. It is a cruel twist for a player who simply wanted the chance to play football again.

Cristiano Ronaldo's influence in the Saudi Pro League is reportedly impacting three high-profile deals that were being lined up late in the winter transfer window. Portuguese GOAT CR7 is frustrated at how things are playing out at Al-Nassr and is looking to flex his muscles when it comes to business being done by domestic rivals in the Middle East.

Big money continues to be invested by ambitious outfits in Saudi Arabia, with Ronaldo helping to start that trend when he made his way to Al-Nassr in 2023. After seeing his contract torn up at Premier League giants Manchester United, the Portuguese signed the most lucrative terms in world football when heading to Riyadh.

He has since agreed an extension to that deal through to the summer of 2027. The evergreen frontman will be 42 by that time that contract comes to a close. He is being tipped by many to play on beyond that point.

It could be that the five-time Ballon d'Or decides to take on a new challenge before hanging up his boots, with the Portugal international cutting a frustrated figure at present. It is being claimed that CR7 could go on strike and refuse to play for Al-Nassr in upcoming fixtures.

He may be absent from a derby date with Al-Riyadh on Monday. There had been reports to suggest that Ronaldo would be rotated out of that contest in order to keep him fresh. Al-Nassr are understandably eager to avoid pushing their talismanic captain to breaking point.

Portuguese news outlet A Bola have, however, claimed that Ronaldo is “unhappy with the way the PIF (Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia) is managing the club he has represented for three years, especially compared to the treatment given to rival clubs, also managed by the same fund”.

The all-time great wants more money to be injected into his project and will not stand by idly as others are allowed to carry out impressive business. That has meant stepping in to prevent deals being reached by Saudi Pro League opponents.

Ronaldo's former Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema has become embroiled in a contract dispute at Al-Ittihad, leading to exit talk being sparked there. It was suggested that table-topping Al-Hilal were eager to add the prolific French striker to their ranks.

Any agreement there is being blocked by Ronaldo “on the grounds that it would damage the fair competition environment”. That is despite the Portuguese icon seeing the likes of Sadio Mane, Joao Felix and Kingsley Coman join him at Al-Nassr.

Ronaldo's intervention is having a domino effect across the Saudi Pro League, with a couple of other big-name performers unable to complete transfers that are in the pipeline and ready to be signed off.

Sports Digitale report that: “Cristiano Ronaldo's intervention in Karim Benzema's Al-Hilal transfer has caused N'Golo Kante to be unable to sign with Fenerbahce yet, while Youssef En-Nesyri has been unable to join Al-Ittihad. The clubs have finalised the agreements and submitted them to the Saudi Pro League; official signatures are on hold pending approval.”

Willingness to bow to Ronaldo's demands highlights how desperate those in the Saudi Pro League are to keep him settled in his current surroundings. If he were to be pushed too far, then it could be that he seeks a move elsewhere and takes his considerable global following with him.

Compromises will now be sought that help to make everybody happy. Benzema may still be on the move, and that could allow Kante and En-Nesyri to complete the transfers that they are already committed to.

Ronaldo is desperate to give himself the best possible chance of chasing down major honours in 2026, having found tangible success hard to come by across his spell with Al-Nassr. He is also chasing down 1,000 competitive career goals and is expected to lead Portugal into this summer's World Cup as captain of his country - with more history being made there.

World Cup

SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles will host eight 2026 World Cup games, including two U.S. group matches Patrick T. Fallon / AFP / Getty Images

The Athletic has live coverage of the latest news for the 2026 World Cup. 

FIFA is selling parking passes at 2026 World Cup games in Los Angeles for $250 or $300 per matchday and per spot — more than the price of some actual match tickets.

The passes are for parking spaces more than a mile away from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., according to listings on FIFA's “official World Cup 2026 parking website.”

SoFi will host eight World Cup matches, including the U.S. team's opener and a quarterfinal. For those two matches, a single parking spot is priced at $300. For the other six, including Iran vs. New Zealand and the third U.S. group match, a pass costs $250. (A Category 3 ticket to some of those matches costs $140 or $180.)

A FIFA spokesperson, when asked to justify the prices, told The Athletic that “parking prices are determined based on local market conditions and benchmarking against comparable major events previously held in each host city.”

The $250 spots appear to be in or near the “VIP West Garage” at the Intuit Dome, the Los Angeles Clippers basketball arena, which is just outside SoFi Stadium's Hollywood Park campus. FIFA's parking website, which is operated by JustPark, estimates that the walk from parking spot to stadium would take 21 minutes, though the exact length would depend on security checkpoints, entrances and other factors.

For Clippers games, parking in the garage costs $56.50; and for the upcoming NBA All-Star Game, it costs $88.

At Los Angeles Rams NFL games, parking cost $71 per game in 2025 for those who bought season passes in lots directly adjacent to SoFi Stadium.

Those stadium-adjacent lots, however, are unlikely to be open to fan parking at World Cup matches, and will likely be inside security perimeters. Some could be used for hospitality, sponsor activations or other operations. That will be the case at most, if not all, 2026 World Cup venues — there are 16 in total across the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

“The stadium footprint is going to look a lot different,” Lindsey Douglas, the chief operating officer of Kansas City's World Cup host committee, said last month.

Parking spaces, therefore, will be relatively scarce. At Kansas City Chiefs NFL games, by comparison, there are typically around 20,000 spaces surrounding Arrowhead Stadium and the neighboring baseball stadium. But for Kansas City's World Cup games, only 4,000 spaces will be “available for sale for ticket holders,” Douglas said.

FIFA is essentially capitalizing on that scarcity, not unlike NFL teams and other U.S. sports franchises do weekly, but to a different degree.

The Los Angeles parking passes are now the costliest, but prices in other cities also shocked fans when revealed in November. Passes have now been made available at seven of the 11 U.S. stadiums. The minimum price — for group-stage matches at Arrowhead in Kansas City, AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta — is $75. That's more than the cost of a Category 3 group-stage ticket at the last men's World Cup, held in Qatar in 2022.

In Miami, the minimum parking price was also $75 in November, but FIFA has since raised it to $100 — for group games involving Uruguay, Saudi Arabia and Cape Verde.

For Colombia vs. Portugal and Scotland vs. Brazil in Miami — and for some games in other cities, including all seven at Gillette Stadium near Boston — the parking passes are listed as “sold out,” but the FIFA spokesperson said: “As planning continues and details are finalized, additional inventory is expected to be made available. As a result, listings currently marked as ‘sold out' do not necessarily reflect final availability.”

Miami is one of several host cities where transportation to and from World Cup games could be a logistical nightmare. It was harrowing for some fans at Hard Rock Stadium and other venues during last summer's Club World Cup.

That, in part, is because many U.S. metropolitan areas lack the public transit infrastructure that sports fans in Europe and elsewhere typically use. Some stadiums are also inconveniently located. Americans, therefore, have grown accustomed to driving to games. Some buy passes in advance, but many drive to stadiums and pay at the entrance to lots on the day of a game.

At the World Cup, though, that won't be easy. A World Cup “customer guide” published by JustPark, FIFA's partner for the sale and management of parking, says that “all parking must be purchased in advance.” The FIFA spokesperson clarified that “in advance” means “no later than 24 hours before kickoff,” and “strongly encouraged” fans to “finalize their transportation plans in advance and, where available, consider mass transit options to help ensure a smooth arrival.”

Lots outside FIFA's purview — such as those run by local establishments or residents — could offer day-of parking, but they are generally far from stadiums, and could be expensive, per basic principles of supply and demand.

Even the passes that FIFA is selling will be for lots outside security perimeters, the FIFA spokesman confirmed.

In addition to public transit, which varies from city to city, local World Cup host committees will offer other services. Kansas City's, for example, will rent more than 200 buses and run shuttles from several locations around the region to Arrowhead Stadium on matchdays. They, too, will charge fans a fee for parking spots at these “park-and-ride” locations. (The fee will also cover shuttle service.) It's unclear if other cities — many of which are struggling to balance budgets while FIFA monopolizes the World Cup's revenue — will provide similar services, whether free or paid.

In Qatar, where the government was willing to spend billions of dollars to stage the 2022 World Cup, fans could ride Doha's metro and buses free.

In North America, hardly anything will be free. Longtime fans have told The Athletic that 2026 will be “by far” the most expensive World Cup ever, “in every sense.” And FIFA will profit. FIFA president Gianni Infantino said last week that the tournament will yield $11 billion.

Parking will be a relatively small piece of the large financial pie, but it will contribute to the overall cost of attendance.

In Philadelphia, group-stage parking costs $115. For knockout matches, prices rise, up to $200 or $225 at Atlanta's semifinal — for parking in lots near Centennial Olympic Park, roughly half a mile from the stadium.

FIFA has consistently justified its prices — for tickets and other things — by noting that it reinvests much of the money in soccer development globally.

In the ongoing debate over ticket prices, it has also pointed to the secondary market, where fans are reselling tickets at significantly higher prices than FIFA's.

That is the case for parking passes, too. On StubHub, as of last Thursday, the cheapest parking pass for Portugal vs. Colombia was $220. For Morocco vs. Brazil, it was $232 — even though FIFA isn't yet selling parking at that game's venue, MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (The “New York New Jersey” page on FIFA's JustPark site, along with pages for Houston, Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area, say that parking availability is “coming soon” or remains “to be determined.”)

It's unclear whether, or how, FIFA has attempted to restrict the resale of parking passes or prevent scalpers from buying passes.

The website includes a note: “IMPORTANT: Only match ticket holders are eligible to purchase parking passes, and you must use the same email address that was used to purchase your match tickets. Parking passes may be cancelled if the email address used to buy parking does not match your ticket purchase email. Only 1 parking pass per customer per match is permitted.”

But it's not clear when or how that restriction would be applied, especially in cases where scalpers also buy and resell tickets; cases where the ticket holder bought their ticket on a third-party site; or cases where a fan attends a match as the guest of a primary ticket buyer.

In response to this concern, the FIFA spokesperson wrote: “Parking passes may only be purchased using the email address associated with a ticket purchase made through www.fifa.com/tickets, including the FIFA Resale Platform. Each ticket holder may purchase one parking pass per match. On match day, fans will be required to present both their valid match ticket and parking pass to access parking areas.”

It's also unclear how many passes will be available at each stadium, and where many of these $75-plus parking spots will be. Los Angeles and Atlanta show specific locations, but other listings mark the stadium and say that the parking space is “0 miles” away. A JustPark customer support representative told The Athletic via email in November that the “0 miles” is “just a placeholder. Parking lots and spaces will be allocated closer to the event date.”

The FIFA spokesperson, beyond confirming that spots will be outside security perimeters, noted that plans were still “evolving,” and wrote: “Additional details, including parking maps and operational layouts, will be shared in due course.”

Ricardo Pepi will not be gracing the Premier League this season, with Fulham's proposed transfer for the United States men's national team forward now reported as called off.

Pepi was thought to be moving towards a €37 million ($43.7 million, £32 million) switch from PSV Eindhoven to the team from west London. But Fabrizio Romano has revealed that the Dutch club pulled the plug because they did not find an acceptable replacement.

It means that Pepi will now see out 2025–26 with PSV, for whom he has scored 11 goals in 22 matches played across all competitions so far this season.

After finding the net in five consecutive Eredivisie appearances from the end of November until early January, the 23-year-old Texan has been ruled out for the past three weeks with a broken arm. He would have joined Fulham injured, unable to play until some time in March.

If his recovery goes as expected, Pepi should be healthy and available by the time the USMNT is due to host challenging back-to-back World Cup warm-up friendlies at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in late March against Belgium and Portugal.

The FC Dallas youth alum will have two more months to build his match fitness as PSV seek to wrap up a third successive Dutch league title—they lead nearest competitor Feyenoord by 17 points with 13 games to play—and be fully ready for the 2026 World Cup in North America.

Another two warm-ups on May 31 and June 6 will come against Senegal and Germany respectively, before June 12's Group D opener against Paraguay.

Pepi could feasibly still become the next American to star in England's Premier League. His performances in what is destined to be a title-winning season for PSV prompted Fulham's interest this month and, as long as he returns to a similar level once his arm is healed, there is no reason why the Cottagers or alternative suitors wouldn't be back in for him come summer.

PSV are clearly willing to sell, as evidenced by agreeing on a transfer fee with Fulham—it's only a lack of time that caused the brakes to be pumped on this one now—and will probably hope to see Pepi light up the World Cup because of the inflationary effect it could have on his valuation.

There is a long list of Americans in Premier League history, but the number of currently active U.S. players in England's top flight is just four: Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace) and Antonee Robinson (Fulham).

Gold ticker tape rained down on Arsenal for the second time in eight months as captain Kim Little and vice-captain Leah Williamson lifted the inaugural FIFA Champions Cup gilded plate.

Following their Women's Champions League triumph in May — continuing their record as the only English club to conquer Europe — they made history yet again on Sunday by beating Brazilian side Corinthians 3-2 in extra time and pocketing $2.3million (£1.7m) in prize money.

Little described the victory as a “different feeling” when asked how this intercontinental title compares to the Champions League. “It's another trophy,” she told reporters after the win. “As players and a club, that is what we want to do.”

The Corinthians players were left disconsolate after losing a final with a real edge. “We wanted to give our fans their dream to be world champions,” head coach Lucas Piccinato said in her post-match press conference. “It was a magical moment for us. We will never forget playing the European champions in their own home.”

It is hard to assess what significance this new competition holds. Perhaps Arsenal season ticket holder Kevin Price put it best.

“It doesn't compare to the Champions League trophy,” he told The Athletic outside the Emirates before kick-off. “A four-team competition, albeit champions of their respective continents, but you play two games and win a trophy. That's not how most competitions work. Champions League — the best. This will be good for bragging rights. Best team in the world and all that.”

But the tournament was marred by last-minute organisational issues, a presenting partner with a conflict of interest and a winning side handed an overwhelming home advantage.

It was always going to be a challenge to attract fans to a midweek midday kick-off in Brentford, but FIFA had recruited hundreds of local school children in high-vis jackets to try to fill the 17,250-capacity Community Stadium for Wednesday's first semi-final between Corinthians and Gotham FC.

As it was, the shrieking children met their match as the Corinthian supporters were the stars of the show, out-singing and outlasting the neutral crowd. England manager Sarina Wiegman watched on alongside FIFA's chief football officer Jill Ellis.

Speaking to the media before the tournament, Ellis emphasised the importance of continuing to “elevate, grow and support the ecosystem” of women's club football. FIFA sees the Champions Cup as a stepping stone towards the delayed 2028 Club World Cup, designed to grow global competitiveness and investment.

This intercontinental tournament can incentivise confederations to invest in the women's game.

The winners' cheque is the highest payout awarded in women's club football, according to FIFA — although World Sevens Football (W7F), a new seven-a-side tournament introduced last year, awarded Bayern Munich $2.5m when they won in May. Arsenal's players will receive a winning bonus, but the $2.3m they won represents 10 per cent of the women's team's overall revenue in the 2024-25 season, and is nearly six times what the Champions League winners earn ($398,000).

Such numbers are praiseworthy but could also distort competitive balance in domestic leagues. That is even more important in women's football than in the men's game, and the growing gaps between teams could threaten the long-term sustainability of women's club football.

There had been a misguided assumption that the Champions Cup would culminate in a showdown between Arsenal and Gotham, the Women's Super League (WSL) against the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), but Corinthians captain Gabi Zanotti upset that party.

If there were any questions about what this tournament meant to her, she made it clear. “I have dedicated my whole life to reach this point,” she said, describing her decisive semi-final goal as “the most important” of her career.

The 40-year-old said the introduction of such competitions “took too long to happen”, and it was important to develop women's football globally.

Most players shared Arsenal's Olivia Smith's view that it was an “honour” and a “great opportunity” for their club to play in such a tournament. She welcomed the addition of more tournaments like the Champions Cup, and insisted that any chance to win a trophy is significant.

There have, however, been large wrinkles in the process.

First, the tournament was played in January. For Gotham and Corinthians, this is usually their off-season, whereas Arsenal and Moroccan side AS FAR are in the middle of their campaigns. There is no perfect solution that suits all parties, given different leagues play at different times of the year. But the 2027 and 2029 editions of the Champions Cup will also take place in January, as will the 2028 Club World Cup, although the hosts of all editions are yet to be decided.

Arsenal head coach Renee Slegers said the schedule “works for us” and they have a deep enough squad to compete on all fronts, whereas her Gotham counterpart, Juan Amoros, said it was “challenging”. The NWSL side brought their usual season preparation three to four weeks ahead of schedule, travelling from the United States to Spain on January 2. This time last year, they would have only been having their first-team meetings at this point.

“We hit the ground running right after New Year's in a way that is significantly earlier than any other NWSL team has ever started historically, including us last year,” Gotham general manager Yael Averbuch West told The Athletic before their 1-0 semi-final defeat. “This is not pre-season for us, this is an extension of the end of last season.”

Gotham took this competition seriously. They wanted to win another trophy and put their brand as well as the NWSL on the map. From that aspect, their defeat, in Amoros' words, was “a missed opportunity”. But he said the club does not look for excuses, rather solutions.

“The more you win in the world of football, the more games you play,” said Amoros. “That is the club we want to be, the one that plays all the games.”

The same scheduling issue applied to Corinthians. Zanotti described preparation for such a tournament as “very demanding”. Their last domestic game was in mid-December. “We've only had two weeks to get ready to come here,” she said. “It's not ideal.”

Spare a thought for the WSL, too, which would have been particularly frustrated that attention was being taken away from its heavyweight clash between Manchester City and Chelsea, a hugely influential game in the title race.

Other teething issues centred on organisation.

The introduction of the 2026 edition and its dates were only confirmed in March 2025. Since then, confirmations of venues, broadcasting and commercial partnerships have been very last-minute. A new competition needs a much longer runway to get it off the ground. Ellis acknowledged this.

Six weeks before the competition started, fans did not know where the games would be held. FIFA announced Brentford as host of the semi-finals and Arsenal for the third-place play-off and final as late as December 12. The attendance for the final was 25,031 fans, 7,210 for the third-placed match and 6,177 and 8,066 for the semi-finals.

The Price family's main motivation to go was their unwavering support for Arsenal, but Kevin criticised the tournament's marketing when asked why the crowd may not be as big as the game deserves. “I don't think it's been as well publicised,” he said. “It was sprung on everyone about six weeks ago. I don't think anybody realised how important it was.”

Upon the announcement that the tournament would take place, FIFA said the semi-finals and final would be held at a neutral venue. North America was considered but FIFA decided upon Europe, a decision Ellis acknowledges was made late.

“We know Arsenal is such a pillar in terms of driving the game,” she told members of the media. “Dropping it in a neutral site just doesn't make sense for where the women's game is.”

A FIFA statement said: “Key factors such as visibility, player experience, climate, accessibility for global fans and teams, media infrastructure, and commercial potential were thoroughly evaluated.”

But the selection of the Emirates for the final gave Arsenal a significant advantage, not only playing at home but also avoiding the logistical challenges from travelling.

“It is what it is,” said Piccinato, who wants future editions to be held at a neutral venue. The Corinthians head coach also said his club had complained to FIFA after two Arsenal youth players were pictured watching Corinthians train at their base, which they shared with Arsenal's academy. Slegers described the incident as “innocent” and “unfortunate”.

At one point, there were question marks over whether one of the semi-finals would take place. Morocco's FAR were due to arrive in London on Saturday but they were delayed until Monday evening because of “administrative issues”, according to their press officer.

“We didn't have the time to acclimatise and adapt, but we're doing the best we can,” manager Mohamed Amine Alioua said, even if goalkeeper Hind Hasnaoui added, in all sincerity, that their preparation was “perfect” for Wednesday's 6-0 semi-final defeat against Arsenal. Corinthians also had their own visa issues as Dayana Rodríguez, Gisela Robledo and Paola Garcia arrived on Tuesday, a week later than the rest of their team-mates.

A broadcast partner was not announced until two weeks before the final stage, when Sky and FIFA agreed to air the games in the UK and Ireland. CBS Sports in the U.S. picked up the final and third-placed game, announcing its coverage on Wednesday.

CazeTV, FIFA's broadcast partner in Brazil, received around one million concurrent views of the final on its live stream. By comparison, it had a similar number for Brazil's group-stage game against Panama in the 2023 World Cup.

VISA was announced as the global sponsor two days before the semi-finals while Kynisca, Michele Kang's multi-club ownership organisation, was controversially named the presenting partner of the inaugural competition less than a week before the start date. That led to suggestions of a conflict of interest, as Kang owns WSL side London City Lionesses, NWSL outfit Washington Spirit and eight-time Champions League winners OL Lyonnes.

Even if those teams did not compete in this year's edition, they could compete in future tournaments and at the 2028 Club World Cup. A financial link between an owner and a global tournament organised by the sport's governing body is deeply problematic, and any seed of doubt that there is a perception of bias — however small — has now been irreversibly planted.

It was an unusual arrangement given people cannot buy a product but instead, the partnership indirectly boosts Kang's own clubs' brands and at the final, earned her a seat at the high table alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino, FIFA's chief of global football development Arsene Wenger and Ellis.

FIFA said it is “delighted” with the partnership and is “comfortable”, adding the arrangement was only for the 2026 edition, with Kynisca-associated clubs involved. “Kynisca's support of this tournament reflects their wider commitment to transforming women's football through unprecedented investment, while also advancing elite women's club football,” it added via a statement.

Others will argue Kang has contributed more money to the women's game than any other individual, and that her investment and ambition are needed. If Kang's mission is to advance women's football, as she has repeatedly stated, funding an event that could trigger more investment seems logical.

Considering how late the partnership was announced, had Kang not stepped in, the tournament may have been left without a presenting partner altogether. But while Kang's intentions may be well-meaning, FIFA might have opened Pandora's box.

The sport's world governing body has invested significantly, paying for teams' business-class flights, transport, accommodation, food, beverages and on-the-ground support. Amoros praised the tournament's organisation as “fantastic”, adding that Gotham had everything they needed.

Proper investment in marketing the product is essential, however. FIFA ramped up paid marketing in the week leading up to the tournament and called upon former England international Jill Scott and Arsenal legend Ian Wright to encourage fans to buy tickets.

The tournament's tagline, “a new era of women's football”, did little to capture fans' attention, nor did it add any sense of jeopardy. Just because something is happening does not mean people will turn up. The UK women's football audience is not mature enough yet and FIFA leaned heavily on Arsenal's fanbase. But it would also be understandable if Arsenal were cautious in how they advertised the final — they are also trying to push a pivotal home game in their league campaign against Manchester City on Sunday.

“It stimulates growth when you create competitions,” added Ellis. “We've got to start somewhere. Let's be patient. We're committed to growing this every year.”

Arsenal played the hand they were dealt — and won — but FIFA must learn from its mistakes.

Sport in the United States is dominated by a handful of major leagues that shape culture, media coverage and commercial investment. American football, basketball and baseball have long defined the sporting landscape, while ice hockey maintains a strong presence. However, football, or soccer as it's known in the US, is quietly climbing the rankings, with the FIFA World Cup heading to America later this year.

American Football

American football sits comfortably at the top of the US sporting hierarchy. The National Football League dominates television ratings, sponsorship, sports betting and cultural relevance. The Super Bowl is more than a sporting event; it's a national occasion blending sport and entertainment on an unparalleled scale. Friday night high school games and Saturday college football further embed the sport and the NFL into American life.

Basketball

Basketball is the most internationally recognised American sport, largely thanks to the National Basketball Association. The NBA's star-driven appeal, fast-paced action and global reach have made it a favourite among younger audiences. Icons such as LeBron James and Stephen Curry transcend sport, while the league's strong presence on social media has helped basketball remain culturally relevant in an increasingly digital era.

Baseball

Often referred to as America's pastime, baseball retains a deep emotional and historical connection with fans. Major League Baseball continues to draw large crowds during its long season, and its slower pace appeals to purists who value tradition and statistics. While it may not command the same year-round attention as the NFL or NBA, baseball's roots in American identity remain firmly intact.

Ice Hockey And Other Major Sports

Ice hockey, led by the National Hockey League, enjoys passionate followings in colder regions and traditional markets such as Canada and the northern United States. Meanwhile, motorsports, golf and college athletics also command significant attention, particularly during major events. However, these sports tend to exist in specific niches rather than dominating the national conversation.

Where Football Ranks In America

Football currently sits outside the traditional “big three,” but its trajectory is unmistakably upward. Major League Soccer has expanded rapidly, youth participation continues to grow, and European leagues attract millions of American viewers each weekend. High-profile players choosing the US as a destination have further boosted visibility, while internationally tournaments now attract mainstream media coverage.

The FIFA World Cup Effect

The upcoming FIFA World Cup represents a pivotal moment for football in America. Hosting matches on home soil brings unprecedented exposure, new fans and increased commercial interest. Broadcasters, sponsors and advertisers are all positioning themselves to capitalise, and there's already been an increase in sports betting ahead of the tournament. More importantly, the World Cup offers football a rare chance to embed itself permanently into the American sporting mainstream.

Conclusion

America's sporting landscape remains dominated by established giants, but football's rise is no longer speculative; it is happening in real time. As the FIFA World Cup approaches, the gap between football and the traditional US sports continues to narrow. While it may not overtake American football anytime soon, the tournament could make the moment football firmly claims its place among America's elite sporting passions.

Looking beyond the tournament itself, the long-term legacy could be transformational, influencing grassroots participation, media investment and commercial partnerships. For American audiences, the World Cup may ultimately redefine football's standing and accelerate its evolution into a mainstream sport.

Netflix is gearing up to tell one of the most important sports stories ever put on screen, and it's found its lead. Zoey Deutch has officially signed on to star in The 99'ers, a new U.S. Women's Soccer drama headed to the streamer and directed by Emmy winner Nicole Kassell.

In the film, Deutch will play Marla Messing, the forward-thinking U.S. Women's Soccer executive who helped engineer the historic 1999 World Cup tournament. That event didn't just crown champions, it shattered attendance records, dominated TV ratings, and changed how the world viewed women's sports. It's a big role with real weight behind it, and Deutch feels like a smart choice to anchor the story.

This project also marks another reunion between Deutch and Netflix. She recently starred as Jean Seberg in Richard Linklater's Nouvelle Vague, which earned her an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Performance. She's also appeared in Set It Up opposite Glen Powell and has the upcoming rom-com Voicemails for Isabelle on the way.

People We Meet on Vacation star Emily Bader is also part of the cast, stepping into the cleats of soccer icon Mia Hamm. The film pulls its inspiration from Jeré Longman's 2000 HarperPerennial book The Girls of Summer: The U.S. Women's Soccer Team and How It Changed the World, and zeroes in on that unforgettable summer of 1999.

The story follows the 1990s U.S. Women's National Soccer Team as they battle all expectations and face China in a nerve-shredding penalty kick shootout during the World Cup final. 

Played under brutal heat in front of 93,000 fans, the match drew millions of viewers worldwide and ended with a victory that reshaped the future of women's athletics. That moment didn't fade with time. It became a cultural milestone.

The screenplay comes from a stacked group of writers including Katie Lovejoy, Dana Stevens, and Peter Hedges, with Jill Mazursky and Jamee Decio credited as the first writers on the project. 

Outside of The 99'ers, Deutch has been busy. She was recently in Park City supporting Celebrity Sex Pass, a Sundance comedy directed by David Wain, where she stars alongside Jon Hamm and John Slattery. 

The 99'ers isn't just about winning a championship. It's about visibility, belief, and a group of women who forced the sports world to pay attention. With Deutch leading the charge and Kassell at the helm, this Netflix film has a real shot at doing justice to a story that still hits hard decades later.

February 2 – Arsenal won the inaugural FIFA Women's Champions Cup on Sunday evening picking up the largest prize payout in the history of women's football. An English team also won the first edition of the expanded men's Club World Cup last summer, when Chelsea picked up $100 million.

Renée Slegers' side defeated South American champions Corinthians 3–2 after extra time at the Emirates Stadium, landing a £1.7 million winners' cheque as FIFA's new six-team tournament made its debut in the international calendar. 

Designed to bring together the continental champions from around the world, the competition represents FIFA's most ambitious step yet in globalising elite women's club football – despite Arsenal coincidentally playing at their home ground for the final in front of a smaller-than-expected crowd of 25,031 at the 60,700-capacity Emirates Stadium.

The Champions League holders made a fast start at their home ground in north London, with record signing Olivia Smith opening the scoring after 15 minutes. Corinthians responded quickly through captain Gabi Zanotti, who equalised six minutes later, leaving the match finely balanced at the break.

Arsenal regained control in the second half when England defender Lotte Wubben-Moy headed home to restore the lead, and the hosts appeared to be in cruise control until a 96th-minute penalty allowed the Brazilian side to force extra time, threatening to spoil Arsenal's night.

Instead, it was substitute Caitlin Foord who delivered the defining moment, beating goalkeeper Lele at her near post in the 104th minute to decide the final and confirm Arsenal as the first winners of the Women's Champions Cup.

The closing stages were not without concern for the hosts, with goalkeeper Anneke Borbe stretchered off following a collision with teammate Wubben-Moy, slightly tempering the celebrations at full time.
Captain Kim Little praised her side's composure under pressure. “It's great to get the win,” she said. “We showed incredible character and resilience to lose the goal right at the end and come back in extra time. The girls did great.

“It's obviously a unique experience, it being the first Champions Cup. We'll take a lot from winning today and getting a trophy.”

With FIFA positioning the Women's Champions Cup and the expansion to a Women's Club World Cup as a cornerstone of the women's calendar, Arsenal's victory sets an early benchmark – on the pitch and commercially – for a new phase of the women's club game.

England are to base themselves at a £197-a-night boutique hotel as they seek to end their World Cup drought.

Thomas Tuchel and his squad will shun the bright lights of big cities such as New York and Miami and make Kansas City their home for the tournament, which is being held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

And sources in the US have disclosed to Daily Mail Sport that Tuchel, Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham – should he make it – will head for a parkside inn on the outskirts of the Missouri city which describes itself as being in the style of ‘an English Cottage'.

The Three Lions have blocked out bookings at The Inn at Meadowbrook, a boutique facility on the grounds of a former country club which can come in at less than £200 per one-night stay.

With 54 rooms, the hotel offers ‘contemporary charm', according to its website, and features an outdoor pool and hot tub.

However, there is no longer a golf course, which may disappoint the likes of Kane, who is said to play off three. There are a host of championship courses within driving distance.

England are preparing to make their World Cup base at the charming The Inn at Meadowbrook

Thomas Tuchel may wish to gather his squad for lakeside chats at the picturesque complex near Kansas City

Prices in Kansas City tend to be lower than in major coastal centres and the hotel has a sterling reputation, boasting a 4.9 rating out of five on the TripAdvisor website, with guests hailing its luxurious touches. One solitary visitor delivered a one-star rating, complaining that there was no reading light in their superior room.

England will play their group matches in Dallas, New York and Boston and have chosen Kansas City thanks to its relatively central location. However, the Netherlands and Argentina will also be based in the Midwest city and were given a higher priority by FIFA when it came to the allocation of facilities as they are both playing matches in the area.

England decided to find a base rather than city-hop after consulting with senior players. FA officials will now set about making the hotel a home from home with a series of personalised touches. At previous tournaments, pictures of loved ones and families have been placed into rooms while, as Daily Mail Sport revealed, a comforting scent has been pumped into public areas.

Newcastle United's Anthony Gordon may be interested to hear that the Inn has a series of trails and ‘Cruiser' bikes to hire. The winger famously took a tumble while the England squad went for a bike ride at their hotel during the European Championship in Germany although the extra-wide tyres on Cruisers are designed to prevent any similar mishaps.

Tuchel himself may well be housed in the ‘Grand Suite', which features dining for eight, a fireplace and a banquette that overlooks tiered lakes. The suite also features a soaking tub and powder room. While England have kept there plans close to their chest, in what is perhaps a telltale sign, rooms are unavailable to book at the hotel throughout the duration of the tournament.

Should players wish to have a heart-to-heart or dissect performances, the hotel features a firepit situated within a courtyard. There is also a 24-hour gym, which may be needed after a visit to the hotel's restaurant. England will bring their own chefs, but in normal circumstances guests can head to American restaurant Verbena, which offers a number of tasty-looking, calorific desserts including fried apple pie, a banana croissant and bread pudding with rum caramel and a malted white chocolate mousse with candied pumpkin seed crumble, pumpkin bread crouton and pomegranate.

A well-stocked wine cellar includes a $950 Californian Red while, if England go all the way, they will find a $240 Rose champagne to toast their success.

Fittingly the hotel bills itself as styled like 'an English cottage' full of 'contemporary charm'

The publication of Deloitte's Money League raised some eyebrows, not least because it placed Manchester United eighth in the list – their lowest ever position – and below the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal. However, Old Trafford officials may well point to the recently-issued Forbes list, which claims they are the second-most valuable football club on the planet, behind only Real Madrid. 

While Deloitte focus on revenue (with United's recent numbers taking a hit thanks to under-performance on the field and a lack of Champions League football), Forbes concentrates more on the long-term value of the business. 

Liverpool were the only other English team to make the top 50 although, perhaps interestingly, in Forbes' list of the most profitable clubs United finish 11th with Tottenham Hotspur in 12th.

In attempting to justify the astronomical prices for World Cup tickets FIFA have quietly pointed out that different rules apply when it comes to the US market. A look at next weekend's Super Bowl would appear to support that point. 

The cheapest nosebleed seat to see the New England Patriots take on Seattle Seattle Seahawks comes in at close to £4,500 on resale sites. If you want one of the best views at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara on Sunday night then you are looking at around £31,000 for a lower bowl seat which does not include any corporate hospitality.

Paris Saint-Germain's assault on London is continuing with the arrival of what officials are calling ‘an experiential laboratory' in Cavendish Square.The French giants opened a store on Oxford Street back in 2023 and will later this month unveil ‘La Maison', which the club say will ‘deliver unique experiences at the crossroads of sport, culture and Parisian lifestyle'.

The offering will include a training room where visitors can take high-intensity workouts and yoga sessions, a café which offers ‘a curated coffee and patisserie experience' and a Sneaker Lab. DJs and musicians will perform on the second floor while the third will feature a tasting room and private dining.

Final: Arsenal 3-2 Corinthians (aet)

Smith 15, Wubben-Moy 58, Foord 104; Zanotti 21, Albuquerque 90+6 pen

The most decorated women's club in England made more history in London on Sunday night, Arsenal securing a 3-2 win over the Copa Libertadores champions Corinthians in extra time to see them crowned winners of the inaugural Fifa Women's Champions Cup.

They were made to work for their victory, the Brazilians twice coming from behind to force another 30 minutes of football, but it was something of an inevitability. The Champions League winners benefited from being mid-season with players at full fitness – in contrast to Corinthians being in their pre-season and the Concacaf Champions Cup winners Gotham FC in their off-season – and from the decision to hold the tournament in London, and play the final at the Emirates Stadium. This was a competition set up for European success and Arsenal delivered. They are officially the world's best club and they have a nice trophy to prove it. The 13-point gap, albeit with a game in hand, between them and Women's Super League leaders Manchester City though, says otherwise.

The mood prior to kick-off was one of general bemusement at a competition Arsenal did not need in their schedule, sandwiched between critical WSL fixtures against Chelsea and City. “I think we all, and the players first, want to be competing at the highest level and they want to play games,” said the Arsenal manager, Renée Slegers, when asked about how they managed to fit these games into their season.

“That's what they train for, what they live for. What's important is that if the schedule goes further and further in adding games that we do it in a tempo that is fair to the players and the players' health. We are in a position where we have a really good squad with a lot of quality, but I'm also aware that not all teams have this luxury. So I think we have to be really aware of what we're doing, how we're growing competitions and adding competitions to the schedule, so we grow it in the right way.”

The club from São Paulo offered a far sterner test than semi-final opponents AS Far. The desire to take the title back to Brazil was evident in the talk of the fans, the manager, Lucas Piccinato, in the outrage at two unfortunate Arsenal academy players caught in a spying storm because they were spotted looking out the window at the Brazilian side as they trained at Barnet's stadium, where Arsenal's academy is based, and in the one million people watching on the stream of the Brazilian broadcaster CazéTV at the same time the men's team were playing Flamengo in the Supercopa.

“It was a big advantage playing in their home, but it is what it is,” said Piccinato. “We hope next time Arsenal will come to Brazil to play against us. I think it would be better if it was in a neutral venue.”

The home team were predictably dominant on their home turf, but it was the Corinthians faithful who dominated in the stands, outnumbered but not outsung. The opening goal arrived 15 minutes in, when Corinthians' goalkeeper Leticia parried Stina Blackstenius's effort into the path of Olivia Smith who swung home on the half volley.

Corinthians threatened on the counter but the equaliser came from a set piece, when Anneke Borbe failed to prevent a header from the 40-year-old Gabi Zanotti from crossing the line following Andressa's corner.

Gotham won the Women's Champions Cup third-place playoff by convincingly defeating AS Far 4-0 at Arsenal Stadium. The NWSL champions took the lead through Khyah Harper, before Savannah McCaskill's first-time finish and Jaedyn Shaw's penalty put the game out of reach by half-time. A Midge Purce tap-in after the break finished off the Moroccan side.



Gotham's coach, Juan Carlos Amorós, still had his thoughts on his side's 1-0 semi-final defeat by Corinthians in the aftermath. “It's a similar game in a lot of ways to the one we played four days ago,” he said. “The main difference is we were able to get the early lead that we know unsettled teams, and we were able to be more clinical in front of goal, which really allowed us to then play a bit more of a game where players can enjoy.” Guardian sport

Arsenal's second came from a less familiar source, the centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy pulling away from her marker to head in from Emily Fox's cross from the right.

Seemingly home, though not dry, they were punished again by the never-say-die Brazilian side. Katie McCabe was adjudged to have fouled Gisela Robledo deep into added time despite appearing to have got the ball before the player and, after a video assistant review, Vic Albuquerque converted from the spot to force extra time.

The celebrations were wild, but short-lived; the Gunners were patient and punctured the momentum of the visiting team on the counter when Frida Maanum dispossessed Duda Sampaio and found her fellow substitute Caitlin Foord, who fired in.

There was a nasty accident at the close when Borbe collided with Wubben-Moy and a Corinthians player as she smothered the ball beneath their feet. The goalkeeper left on a stretcher and was taken to hospital as a precaution.

It was relief for Arsenal when the final whistle blew, Foord's strike saving them from embarrassment in a tournament where they had a significant advantage. If this competition is to gain credibility and momentum, it needs a substantial amount of work back at the drawing board.

February 2 – FIFA, The FA and the Women's Super League Football (WSL Football) have announced two programmes to increase the number of women's coaches in the game as the cornerstone of the Women's Champions Cup 2026 legacy programme.

The aim is to remove barriers, accelerate professional development and create sustainable pathways for female coaches. FIFA is fund a targeted scholarship programme providing financial support for female coaches in England who are pursuing the UEFA A Diploma and the UEFA Pro Diploma.

A second initiative will deliver an evidence-based, individualised development programme for female coaches already working in a coaching role. The objective is to accelerate learning and progression within England's elite women's football environment.

“Competitions like this one help us to strengthen the pathways in women's football and to elevate the entire ecosystem. The future of the game really depends on what we build beyond the pitch,” said FIFA's Chief Football Officer, Jill Ellis.

“There are simply not enough women in coaching, not because of a lack of talent or ambition, but largely due to limited access and opportunity, and a lack of clear pathways. Closing this gap is essential not only to equity, but also to unlocking the full potential of our sport. This landmark legacy coaching initiative is one of the most direct ways we can have a positive impact,” Ellis continued.

The push is to unlock access to senior roles and further high-performance development opportunities for women.

“We have already seen many incredible female coaches progress through UEFA's A and Pro Diploma courses, and this scholarship provides opportunities for more women to follow this path and access elite coaching education that will help advance their coaching careers,” said the Head of Coach Development at The FA, Dan Clements.

“… it is imperative that we continue to nurture the existing pool of talented female coaches. That is why we are excited to collaborate and deliver this development programme, which will ensure that the knowledge and skill sets of female coaches develop as the women's game continues to grow.”

Carlos Alcaraz celebrated winning the Career Grand Slam at the Australian Open on Sunday by stepping into the sun on Monday, when he enjoyed a photoshoot with the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup.

The 22-year-old Spaniard, dressed in all black, posed with the trophy during the shoot, which took place at the Royal Exhibition Building among gardens in central Melbourne.

Entering this year's Australian Open, the 22-year-old had one clear aim: to complete the Career Grand Slam. Having already triumphed on two occasions at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open, the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings was determined to complete the historic set in Melbourne. 
Alcaraz did not drop a set en route to the last four, before he rallied from 3-5 down in the fifth set against Alexander Zverev to win the longest semi-final in tournament history (five hours, 27 minutes). Alcaraz then overcame 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic in the final to lift his seventh major and first in Australia.

Just a casual stroll in the park... as a Career Grand Slam Champion 😌 🏆#AustralianOpen pic.twitter.com/uFRtkVdRtN

Entering this year's Australian Open, the 22-year-old had one clear aim: to complete the Career Grand Slam. Having already triumphed on two occasions at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open, the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings was determined to complete the historic set in Melbourne. 

Alcaraz did not drop a set en route to the last four, before he rallied from 3-5 down in the fifth set against Alexander Zverev to win the longest semi-final in tournament history (five hours, 27 minutes). Alcaraz then overcame 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic in the final to lift his seventh major and first in Australia.

Oleksandra Oliynykova claimed the first WTA main-draw win of her career late on Sunday night at the Transylvania Open, overcoming Mayar Sherif 6-7(6), 6-4, 6-4 in 2 hours and 54 minutes from 3-1 down in the third set -- and revealed afterward that she was lucky to be at the tournament at all.

Cluj-Napoca: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The Ukrainian captured hearts two weeks ago at the Australian Open with her positive demeanor, valiant first-round challenge against defending champion Madison Keys and heartfelt words about her soldier father on her country's frontline. She had to navigate the perils of living in a war zone again just to get to Cluj-Napoca when Kyiv suffered a widespread power outage last week.

"When I was losing in the third set in some moments, I said to myself just to enjoy being here, because actually it's a big luck to compete in this tournament," Oliynykova said in her on-court interview.

"I live and practice in Kyiv and because of Russian attacks, we have very big problems with electricity. Two hours before my train -- because I live on the 20th floor -- I'm entering the lift and electricity just turns off. In the end, I was just 10 minutes before my train left. So actually it's a big luck.

"I just said to myself, 'C'mon, there was a possibility that you would not come to this tournament. Try to enjoy it, try to play more free and more creative.' And actually, that was the key today to win."

There was plenty of creativity on show from both players throughout the enthralling contest. Lung-busting rallies and chess-like tactics were the order of the day as Oliynykova and Sherif deployed every tool at their disposal to out-manoeuvre each other. A series of exquisite drop shots from the Egyptian saw her sneak a top-quality first-set tiebreak after saving one set point, but Oliynykova bounced back superbly. Her variety and point construction proved crucial: Oliynykova frequently used high moonballs as an offensive weapon, pushing Sherif behind the baseline before flattening out her own strokes for winners.

The 24-year-old visibly gave her all in the deciding set, winning two of her best points of the match despite slipping over as she won five of the last six games. Watch the full highlights below.

Oliynykova will face No. 8 seed Anna Bondar in the second round after the Hungarian escaped Ella Seidel 4-6, 7-6(6), 6-0 after coming within two points of defeat in the second-set tiebreak.

Carlos Alcaraz has already broken a lot of records in his young career, but in Melbourne on Sunday night he broke his biggest one yet.He battled past Novak Djokovic for his first Australian Open title, 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5, and having already won the other three Grand Slam events—twice each, no less—the 22-year-old Spaniard has become the youngest man in tennis history to complete the Career Grand Slam.The previous record dates all the way back to 1938, when the late Don Budge, a slightly older 22 at the time, completed his set at Roland Garros.MEN TO COMPLETE THE CAREER SLAM (all-time, listed by age):22 years, 8 months: Carlos Alcaraz [at 2026 Australian Open]22 years, 11 months: Don Budge [at 1938 Roland Garros]24 years, 1 month: Rod Laver [at 1962 US Open]24 years, 3 months: Rafael Nadal [at 2010 US Open]26 years, 0 months: Fred Perry [at 1935 Roland Garros]27 years, 8 months: Roy Emerson [at 1964 Wimbledon]27 years, 9 months: Roger Federer [at 2009 Roland Garros]29 years, 0 months: Novak Djokovic [at 2016 Roland Garros]29 years, 1 month: Andre Agassi [at 1999 Roland Garros]

Having won his first US Open title at age 19, his first Wimbledon title at age 20 and his first Roland Garros title at age 21, it's only fitting that Alcaraz would win his first Australian Open title this year at age 22.The Happy Slam had been a thorn in his side, though, his best results coming into this year's edition being two quarterfinals—he fell to Alexander Zverev in that round in 2024 and to Djokovic in 2025.This year, after a 7-5, 6-2, 6-1 victory over Alex de Minaur to finally get over the quarterfinal hump, the Spaniard got revenge against Zverev in the semifinals with a grueling 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-7 (3), 6-7 (4), 7-5 victory, overcoming cramping and battling back from 5-3 down in the fifth set to outlast the German after five hours and 27 minutes on court.

PURE SORCERY 🎩🪄Just tennis at its best 😲pic.twitter.com/SL7x1i3XAs

Things looked dicey for a while against Djokovic in the final, as the 10-time Australian Open champion came out swinging, breaking twice and never facing a break point himself to clinch the first set in 33 minutes.But the momentum shifted from there, as Alcaraz started cutting down on the unforced errors—after hitting nine in the first set, he had 10 in the second and third sets combined—and he broke Djokovic twice in each of those next two sets, soon finding himself up two sets to one.After holding serve in the opening game of the fourth set, Alcaraz brought up six break points in the next game but couldn't convert, and the two fell into a holding pattern, trading games back and forth—Djokovic actually brought up a break point in Alcaraz's 4-all service game, but the Spaniard saved it and ended up holding.A few games later, with Djokovic serving at 5-6, Alcaraz generated his first match point when Djokovic missed a forehand into the net, and another forehand miss from the Serb on the next point sealed the win.

Djokovic, who had reached the record-extending 38th Grand Slam final of his career in Melbourne this year—and who was going for a record-extending 25th major title, as well—congratulated Alcaraz right out of the gates during his speech at the on-court trophy ceremony.“What you've been doing, I think the best word to describe it is historic, legendary,” the 24-time Grand Slam champion said. “So congratulations, and I wish you the best of luck for the rest of your career.“I mean, you're so young, you have a lot of time, like myself,” he added. “I'm sure we'll see each other many more times in the next 10 years!”Likewise, Alcaraz started his speech by congratulating Djokovic."Obviously, first of all, I just wanted to talk about Novak. He deserves an ovation, for sure," the now-seven-time major winner said. "You're talking about how I'm doing the amazing things, but what you're doing is really inspiring, not only for the tennis players, but all the athletes and people around the world, and for me as well. Just putting the hard work every day with your team every tournament you go, and playing such great tennis, for me I just enjoy so much watching you playing. For me it's been an honor to share the locker, share the court and watching you play."Thank you very much for what you are doing. It's very inspiring to me."

"You're talking about how I'm doing the amazing things, but what you're doing is really inspiring, not only for the tennis players, but all the athletes and people around the world, and for me as well. Just putting the hard work every day with your team every tournament you go, and playing such great tennis, for me I just enjoy so much watching you playing. For me it's been an honor to share the locker, share the court and watching you play."Thank you very much for what you are doing. It's very inspiring to me."

"Thank you very much for what you are doing. It's very inspiring to me."

F1 Barcelona Shakedown 2026: Day 5 Highlights

Newey 'always teaching us something', says Fernando Alonso

George Russell says he's ready to fight for a World Championship in 2026, while also harboring hopes of going toe to toe with four-time champion Max Verstappen.

George Russell says he's ready to fight for the Formula 1 world title with Mercedes but admits that, while the Barcelona Shakedown was encouraging, it's "too early to say" if this year's Silver Arrows will be the leading contender.

Mercedes had a very productive three days of running at a cold Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya as drivers and teams focused on understanding their new machines that have been built to sweeping new chassis and power unit regulations for 2026 – rather than looking at performance.

Russell is entering his eighth season in Formula 1 and has five Grand Prix wins under his belt, with many feeling his performances last year were his best yet.

"I feel ready to fight for a World Championship, and whether we have that comment above us or not, that does not change my approach one single bit," said Russell, when speaking to media as Mercedes officially launched their 2026 F1 campaign.

"I'm working so hard with the team, everybody here has been working flat out to really maximise this new set of regulations. I'm honestly just so excited by the challenge, because it is a huge challenge adapting to these new cars, how the energy management works, the re-harvesting of the batteries, getting your head around the boost system, the overtake modes, the active aero.

"There's a lot of things we need to learn very quickly, but I feel I can take advantage from that, and I feel confident with myself and my team."

When asked how he feels about potentially going up against four-time world champion Max Verstappen in a title fight, Russell said: "I'd love for it to turn out that way. I do want to go head-to-head with Max and obviously Lando [Norris] had a great season last year.

"But no, it doesn't add any more pressure. I think probably the fans and people were expecting, you know, to potentially be Mercedes versus McLaren because there was a lot of anticipation that Mercedes would clearly have the best power unit.

"But it seems like the other power unit manufacturers have done a good job and we know that Red Bull have always had an amazing car, even through the years of dominance of Mercedes. It was their engine that was letting them down, not their car.

"And we obviously know how good Max is. So, yeah, I think he's very much going to be in the fight this year. And, you know, that is great. You obviously wish that you'd have a slightly easier time of it but it should never be easy and if you're going to win, you want to have fought for it and won it fair and square on track."

Speaking about Russell's title credentials, boss Toto Wolff said: "It is always nice if your driver is the favourite with the bookmakers, and I think he [Russell] deserves it because he is one of the best. He has shown us where the performance of the car is and has overall been more than great to us.

“But it is always the best driver and the best car that wins, and we have not proven yet that we have a package that is good enough. I hope the bookmakers are right but I'll believe it when we have seen performances that would confirm that."

There was no chase for performance in Barcelona, as the focus really was on learning about the cars and the new systems that are in place for this year – and that's why Russell is keen not to get ahead of himself. But he did concede that Mercedes – who have failed to contend for the title since 2021 – are in a better place, probably their best since 2021, at this point in the year.

"Well, obviously we've only driven the car for three days, and it's still very early days, but quoting Toto, it doesn't look like it's a ****, which is a bonus," he said. "And to be honest, in the early days like this, when it could be a really bad car, and you can sort of highlight those negatives early on, we don't believe it is.

"But is it a car that can produce a World Championship? It's still way too early to see."

He added: "We left Barcelona with a positive feeling, because the car reacted as we anticipated. The numbers we're seeing from the aero on the car match what we see back on the simulator. How the car is handling is matching how it feels on the simulator.

"This is something we've not really experienced since 2021 as a team so we're sort of ticking the boxes of everything that we want to tick, but we can't discount our rivals, because as I said, there was a lot of talk around the Red Bull power unit not being up to standard in year one, but from what we've seen so far, they've definitely delivered.

"The Ferrari power unit looks reliable. They did lots of laps not far behind us over the course of the test. So the truth is that there could be a good fight on our hands, but we're satisfied with what we've experienced so far."

Mercedes, like all of their rivals, are playing down their expectations for this year – and that's no surprise given they are running very different cars with all-new power units built to regulations that have seen the biggest overhaul in more than a decade.

But it is clear that as a starting point, Mercedes are in a better place – as Russell said – than they have been in recent years. The Silver Arrows failed to get on top of the ground effect-era cars - and therefore were not contenders for the last four World Championships.

Ahead of each of those campaigns, Mercedes knew very early on that they were not the favourites – and that they would struggle to get in the mix. This time around, though, they don't have that same feeling. Critically, the car is performing as their simulation tools said they would. There is hope.

This is the first time that Russell will have felt that feeling since he joined Mercedes in 2022 – so it's perhaps not surprising that he is buoyed by how the car feels after three days of running. He even said in his media briefing that he felt confident to push from the very first lap in Barcelona.

Based on vibes, these are the best Mercedes have given off since 2021. Of course, Russell and the team don't know what the other teams are doing so it would be unwise to get too excited.
But given Mercedes have history of delivering a class-leading power unit at a regulation change and that they feel encouraged by the response by the chassis in early runs (which is the opposite of what they have felt for the last four years) you can understand why there is a bit of a spring in their step.

We should get more of an idea of where they stack up next week in Bahrain when work on the set-up of the cars begins – and an even clearer look in the second test when they start chasing performance but it might not be until Australia – or even the first four or five races – until we know for sure if Mercedes are back in the game as world title contenders.

F1 Barcelona Shakedown 2026: Day 5 Highlights

Newey 'always teaching us something', says Fernando Alonso

How will Isack Hadjar stack up against Max Verstappen in comparison to the Red Bull driver's previous team mates?

Having achieved four World Championships, 71 wins, 127 podiums and 48 pole positions since his arrival in Formula 1 more than a decade ago, Max Verstappen has earned his place amongst the most successful drivers in the sport's history – which arguably makes the prospect of becoming his team mate slightly intimidating.

It is a challenge that Isack Hadjar is about to face, with the 21-year-old the next to race alongside Verstappen at Red Bull following the demotion of Yuki Tsunoda to a test and reserve role. Hadjar will be Verstappen's eighth team mate in F1 – but how will he stack up compared to those who held the role before him?

We've been taking a deep-dive through the statistics to see how each of the seven drivers to previously share a garage with Verstappen performed against the Dutchman…

Qualifying head-to-head: Sainz 10-9 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Sainz 7-10 Verstappen
Points scored: Sainz – 18 (36.8% of races finished in points), 15th in championship / Verstappen – 49 (52.6% of races finished in points), 12th in championship
Pole positions: Sainz 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Podiums: Sainz 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Wins: Sainz 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)

An all-rookie line-up joined Toro Rosso in 2015, consisting of Verstappen – who became the youngest driver to make their F1 debut, at 17 years and 164 days old – and Carlos Sainz. The latter made an early impression by scoring points in his first race, while Verstappen was forced to retire with an engine failure.

As the numbers show, the pair were closely matched in the head-to-heads throughout the season. Sainz suffered more mechanically-related retirements – particularly during the middle of the campaign – and Verstappen ultimately ended 2015 with more points.

Qualifying head-to-head: Sainz 1-3 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Sainz 2-2 Verstappen
Points scored: Sainz – 4 (50% of races finished in points), 12th in championship (points total 46 for whole season) / Verstappen – 13 (75% of races finished in points), fifth in championship (points total 204 for whole season)
Pole positions: Sainz 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Podiums: Sainz 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Wins: Sainz 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)

It would turn out to be a much shorter tenure as team mates for Verstappen and Sainz in 2016, with Verstappen promoted to the main Red Bull outfit after just four races. But in those few Grands Prix together prior to the switch, the duo were again relatively well-matched.

Verstappen just beat Sainz in terms of points finishes on three to two, while both drivers suffered a DNF due to a technical issue.

Qualifying head-to-head: Ricciardo 11-6 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Ricciardo 10-7 Verstappen
Points scored: Ricciardo – 220 (100% of races finished in points), third in championship (points total 256 for whole season) / Verstappen – 191 (82.4% of races finished in points), fifth in championship (points total 204 for whole season)
Pole positions: Ricciardo 1 (5.9%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Podiums: Ricciardo 8 (47.1%) / Verstappen 7 (41.2%)
Wins: Ricciardo 1 (5.9%) / Verstappen 1 (5.9%)

A new era unfolded for Verstappen when he made the step up to Red Bull just a few races into his sophomore season, with the Dutchman partnering Daniel Ricciardo while Daniil Kvyat was sent back to the Toro Rosso outfit.

It was a memorable arrival at the squad for Verstappen, the youngster promptly winning on his debut in Barcelona. While the more experienced Ricciardo triumphed in the head-to-heads – the Australian finishing a career-best third in the championship during a particularly strong year – Verstappen ended the campaign equal on wins with his team mate and only scored one less podium.

Qualifying head-to-head: Ricciardo 7-13 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Ricciardo 9-11 Verstappen
Points scored: Ricciardo – 200 (70% of races finished in points), fifth in championship / Verstappen – 168 (65% of races finished in points), sixth in championship
Pole positions: Ricciardo 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Podiums: Ricciardo 9 (45%) / Verstappen 4 (20%)
Wins: Ricciardo 1 (5%) / Verstappen 2 (10%)

Red Bull endured a weaker season in 2017, one in which they often experienced reliability issues. Verstappen suffered more retirements than Ricciardo during the early stages of the campaign but went on to enjoy a stronger run towards the end, scoring two victories in the final six races.

Ricciardo again led the way in terms of points scored, but Verstappen got the better of his team mate in the Qualifying and race day head-to-heads as he continued to hone his skills.

Qualifying head-to-head: Ricciardo 7-14 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Ricciardo 5-14 Verstappen
Points scored: Ricciardo 170 (61.9% of races finished in points), sixth in championship / Verstappen – 249 (81% of races finished in points), fourth in championship
Pole positions: Ricciardo 2 (9.5%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Podiums: Ricciardo 2 (9.5%) / Verstappen 11 (52.4%)
Wins: Ricciardo 2 (9.5%) / Verstappen 2 (9.5%)

The 2018 campaign seemed to mark a turning point in that the momentum appeared to switch in Verstappen's favour. Ricciardo grabbed two wins early in the season – a marked contrast to the difficult start faced by Verstappen – but these would prove to be the Australian's only podium finishes in 2018.

On the other side of the garage, Verstappen collected 11 rostrums and outscored his team mate on most counts, though the Dutchman was still yet to claim a pole position while Ricciardo had also suffered more mechanically-related DNFs. Both drivers failed to finish in Bahrain and Azerbaijan, the latter being due to an infamous collision between the Red Bull cars. Ricciardo later surprised the F1 world by leaving for Renault at the end of the season.

Qualifying head-to-head: Gasly 1-11 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Gasly 1-11 Verstappen
Points scored: Gasly – 63 (75% of races finished in points), seventh in championship (points total 95 for whole season) / Verstappen – 181 (100% of races finished in points), third in championship (points total 278 for whole season)
Pole positions: Gasly 0 (0%) / Verstappen 1 (8.3%)
Podiums: Gasly 0 (0%) / Verstappen 5 (41.7%)
Wins: Gasly 0 (0%) / Verstappen 2 (16.7%)

Following Ricciardo's exit, Red Bull opted to promote Pierre Gasly from Toro Rosso, making the Frenchman Verstappen's third F1 team mate.

While Gasly struggled to match the incumbent driver in the head-to-heads, the numbers suggest that he displayed decent consistency, having scored points in all but three of his races for the squad. This would not be enough to keep his place at the team, however, and Gasly was sent back to Toro Rosso for the remainder of the season after Round 12 in Hungary.

Qualifying head-to-head: Albon 1-8 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Albon 4-5 Verstappen
Points scored: Albon – 76 (88.9% of races finished in points), eighth in championship (points total 92 for whole season) / Verstappen – 97 (77.8% of races finished in points), third in championship (points total 278 for whole season)
Pole positions: Albon 0 (0%) / Verstappen 1 (11.1%)
Podiums: Albon 0 (0%) / Verstappen 4 (44.4%)
Wins: Albon 0 (0%) / Verstappen 1 (11.1%)

Alex Albon became the next to step up to Red Bull, the Thai driver swapping places with Gasly and enjoying a solid run in his nine races alongside Verstappen in 2019.

An impressive record saw Albon collect points in every race – with the only exception being Brazil, where he had looked on course for his debut podium before dropping down the order after contact with Lewis Hamilton – and his performances sealed his place at the Milton Keynes-based outfit for 2020.

Qualifying head-to-head: Albon 0-17 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Albon 5-12 Verstappen
Points scored: Albon – 105 (70.6% of races finished in points), seventh in championship / Verstappen – 214 (70.6% of races finished in points), third in championship
Pole positions: Albon 0 (0%) / Verstappen 1 (5.9%)
Podiums: Albon 2 (11.8%) / Verstappen 11 (64.7%)
Wins: Albon 0 (0%) / Verstappen 2 (11.8%)

In a shortened season owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, Albon faced a tougher outing in 2020, one in which Verstappen was dominant in Qualifying as well as outscoring his team mate on race days.

While Albon came away with his maiden podium at Mugello – as well as scoring a second in Bahrain – Red Bull again decided to make a change to their line-up, resulting in the Thai racer becoming a test and reserve driver for the squad in 2021.

Qualifying head-to-head: Perez 2-20 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Perez 3-19 Verstappen
Points scored: Perez – 190 (72.7% of races finished in points), fourth in championship / Verstappen – 395.5 (86.4% of races finished in points), first in championship
Pole positions: Perez 0 (0%) / Verstappen 10 (45.5%)
Podiums: Perez 5 (22.7%) / Verstappen 18 (81.8%)
Wins: Perez 1 (4.5%) / Verstappen 10 (45.5%)

Red Bull signed the experienced Sergio Perez for 2021, with the team taking the slightly unusual step of looking outside of their driver programme for their new recruit.

Though the Mexican could not prove a match for Verstappen, he fulfilled a solid supporting role in a season remembered for the tense title battle that played out between Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton. During the summer, it was confirmed that Perez would remain a Red Bull driver in 2022.

Qualifying head-to-head: Perez 5-17 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Perez 5-17 Verstappen
Points scored: Perez – 305 (86.4% of races finished in points), third in championship / Verstappen – 454 (90.9% of races finished in points), first in championship
Pole positions: Perez 1 (4.5%) / Verstappen 7 (31.8%)
Podiums: Perez 11 (50%) / Verstappen 17 (77.3%)
Wins: Perez 2 (9.1%) / Verstappen 15 (68.2%)

After a nightmare first race in which both drivers retired with the same mechanical issue, Red Bull quickly bounced back and went on to enjoy an increasingly dominant campaign in 2022.

The Drivers' Championship was claimed by Verstappen with four races to spare, while Perez built further on his 2021 season by doubling his number of podiums and wins, as well as taking a debut pole position.

Qualifying head-to-head: Perez 3-19 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Perez 2-20 Verstappen
Points scored: Perez – 285 (86.4% of races finished in points), second in championship / Verstappen – 575 (100% of races finished in points), first in championship
Pole positions: Perez 2 (8.7%) / Verstappen 12 (52.2%)
Podiums: Perez 9 (39.1%) / Verstappen 21 (91.3%)
Wins: Perez 2 (8.7%) / Verstappen 19 (82.6%)

The statistics from Verstappen's side in 2023 make for astonishing reading, with the Dutch driver scoring a record-breaking 19 wins out of 22 races en route to his most assured title yet.

Such was the level of Verstappen's performance that – despite Perez finishing a career-best second in the championship – the World Champion claimed 290 more points than his team mate.

Qualifying head-to-head: Perez 1-23 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Perez 1-23 Verstappen
Points scored: Perez – 152 (66.7% of races finished in points), eighth in championship / Verstappen – 437 (95.8% of races finished in points), first in championship
Pole positions: Perez 0 (0%) / Verstappen 8 (33.3%)
Podiums: Perez 4 (16.7%) / Verstappen 14 (58.3%)
Wins: Perez 0 (0%) / Verstappen 9 (37.5%)

It initially appeared that Red Bull's 2023 advantage over the rest of the field might repeat in 2024 following a 1-2 result for the squad at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix. However, the picture proved very different as the campaign developed, with the squad's rivals dramatically closing the gap.

Despite the challenges, Verstappen held on to clinch his fourth title – but it was a nightmare campaign for Perez, the Mexican failing to stand on the podium again after Round 5 in China. Red Bull slipped backwards from first to third in the Teams' Championship, and it was announced after the season had concluded that the team and Perez had agreed to part ways with immediate effect.

Qualifying head-to-head: Lawson 0-2 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Lawson 0-2 Verstappen
Points scored: Lawson – 0 (0% of races finished in points), 14th in championship (points total 22 for whole season)/ Verstappen – 36 (100% of races finished in points), second in championship (points total 421 for whole season)
Pole positions: Lawson 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Podiums: Lawson 0 (0%) / Verstappen 1 (50%)
Wins: Lawson 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)

After the exit of Perez, Red Bull promoted Liam Lawson for the 2025 season – but his tenure as Verstappen's team mate would prove to be the shortest of all, the New Zealander struggling to get comfortable with the RB21 machine.

Having qualified at the back of the field during both of the opening races – and crashing out at the rain-affected Australian Grand Prix – Lawson was demoted back to Racing Bulls in time for the third round of the season.

Qualifying head-to-head: Tsunoda 0-22 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Tsunoda 1-21 Verstappen
Points scored: Tsunoda – 30 (31.8% of races finished in points), 17th in championship (points total 33 for whole season) / Verstappen – 385 (95.5% of races finished in points), second in championship (points total 421 for whole season)
Pole positions: Tsunoda 0 (0%) / Verstappen 8 (36.4%)
Podiums: Tsunoda 0 (0%) / Verstappen 14 (63.6%)
Wins: Tsunoda 0 (0%) / Verstappen 8 (36.4%)

While Lawson returned to Racing Bulls, a direct swap saw Yuki Tsunoda become the next to pit himself against Verstappen at Red Bull. However, like Lawson, the Japanese driver also faced his fair share of difficulties in adapting to his new car.

Throughout their 22 races together, Verstappen beat Tsunoda in both head-to-heads – with Tsunoda's only better finish being in Austria, a race that Verstappen retired from on Lap 1 – and ended the season a whopping 15 places ahead in the Drivers' Championship.

Prior to the campaign finale in Abu Dhabi, it was announced that Tsunoda would move to a test and reserve role in 2026. Isack Hadjar, meanwhile, will be the latest to pair up with Verstappen as he makes the step up to Red Bull in the season ahead…

It should come as no surprise that Amazon's documentary “Melania,” about First Lady Melania Trump, grossed $7 million at the box office over the weekend, making it the highest opening for a non-music documentary in over a decade. 

That's not because “Melania” is an exquisitely made, informative documentary. It's not even a documentary. 

Instead, it falls in the category of glossy advertisement or unconvincing propaganda film with a multimillion-dollar music licensing budget. Amazon MGM Studios paid $40 million for the rights to film. That offer came with a jaw-dropping $35 million marketing budget, which Amazon spent while also cutting 16,000 corporate jobs.  The film is the latest streamer-funded, carefully choreographed, boring, celebrity puff piece being branded as a documentary. Previous examples of documentaries in this category include “Michael Jackson's This Is It,” “With Love, Meghan,” and, most recently, “Victoria Beckham,” a Netflix docuseries. (To be fair, all three of those documentaries were far more revealing than “Melania”; the only thing that one learns about Melania Trump during her 104-minute infomercial is that her favorite song is Michael Jackson's “Billie Jean.”)But the merits of Brett Ratner's “Melania” don't matter. The film is and will continue to be a box office hit because anti-woke, conservative, and faith-based documentaries thrive theatrically.

Take Matt Walsh's 2024 “Am I Racist?” — a right-leaning film that tears into diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The film was that year's highest-grossing documentary, earning $12 million at the box office. That same year, a documentary titled “Vindicating Trump” earned $1.3 million theatrically, which for any documentary these days is a lot of money. “Vindicating Trump” was the sixth highest-grossing documentary in 2024. 

Over a decade ago, before the Trump era, conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza's “2016: Obama's America” and “America: Imagine the World Without Her” grossed $33 million and $14 million at the box office, respectively.It's been over 20 years since progressive documentaries were box-office juggernauts. In 2004, Michael Moore's Academy Award-winning film “Fahrenheit 9/11,” a searing look into the George W. Bush administration and the War on Terror, grossed $119,194,771 worldwide, making it the highest-grossing documentary of all time. 

In 2005, Davis Guggenheim's Oscar-winning feature documentary “March of the Penguins,” about global warming, earned $77,437,223 worldwide. That is in stark contrast to the 2025 Oscar-winning feature documentary “No Other Land,” about the occupied Palestinian region of Masafer Yatta, which grossed $3.6 million worldwide. Other recent Oscar-winning documentaries, like “20 Days in Mariupol” and “Navalny,” earned just $35,000 and $107,000 worldwide, respectively.What the documentary industry should be worried about is what the box office success of “Melania” means for filmmakers motivated to make complex nonfiction films with a worldview that disrupt the status quo and have the potential to offend President Trump and his MAGA base. Movies not like “Melania.”Eight years ago, during “the golden age of documentary,” streamers like Amazon made it clear that although they were corporate behemoths, they weren't worried about Trump, who was serving his first term as president. In 2020, Amazon reportedly spent $5 million for global rights to Garrett Bradley's documentary “Time,” about a Louisiana woman's 20-year effort to secure her husband's release from prison. 

 










That same year, the company released the documentary “All In: The Fight for Democracy” about Stacey Abrams, the first Black woman to become a major-party gubernatorial nominee in the United States. In 2019, the streamer acquired the worldwide rights to the documentary “Mayor Pete,” which followed democrat Pete Buttigieg on his presidential campaign trail, and in 2016 the company, owned by Jeff Bezos, acquired exclusive streaming rights to Raoul Peck's “I Am Not Your Negro,” a documentary about late author James Baldwin who, in the film, describes the depressing state of American race relations. Both “Time” and “I'm Not Your Negro” received Academy Award nominations.But things changed last year when not only Amazon, but also Paramount and Disney, went after the rights to “Melania.” It was a clear and deliberate signal to the documentary industry that they would not offend Donald Trump or his MAGA base with progressive documentaries.

Last month at the Sundance Film Festival, documentary filmmakers and producers discovered, according to multiple sources, that Amazon wasn't in the market to acquire and commission any documentaries. Not surprisingly, the company's 2026 budget for nonfiction fare has been used in its entirety to produce and release “Melania.”

Amazon's absence at Sundance is another blow to an industry that has been suffering to stay afloat. Not only are traditional buyers like HBO not buying or commissioning as many documentaries as they did a decade ago, but budgets across the board have also been slashed. Whole documentary divisions have been eliminated or consolidated. A24 shut down its documentary filmmaking department in May 2025.

In January, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting shut down after the Trump administration and Congress voted to defund the organization. CPB is the entity behind PBS, a cornerstone of the doc marketplace. 

 










Then there is tech billionaire Jeff Skoll, the founder and chair of the former socially conscious powerhouse production company Participant Media. Together with the late Diane Weyermann, Skoll produced and helped fund numerous documentaries like “An Inconvenient Truth ” and “RBG” that fed the public's appetite for thought-provoking subject matter. In 2024, Skoll not only closed Participant but also hosted a Donald Trump inauguration victory rally.Currently, the majority of indie documentary filmmakers are relying on an unsustainable self-distribution model and the service-deal marketplace.In Park City, documentary filmmakers, producers, and cinematographers networked, hoping to land a job or at the very least, get a lead on a potential job opportunity. But the writing is on the wall. The future of socially minded or politically progressive documentaries is in jeopardy, and there isn't a left-leaning version of Jeff Bezos to swoop down and save the industry.

Only so many documentary filmmakers and producers can be hired to make more nonfiction films for streamers about celebrities, cults, and true crime. Celebrated documentary filmmakers and producers are turning to reality television for work. Some had to work with Ratner on “Melania” to keep financially afloat. According to Rolling Stone, two-thirds of the crew members who worked on “Melania” requested that their names not be formally credited in the documentary.“I understand if a liberal is working on the movie and they don't want to be credited, but they want to feed their family,” Ratner told Variety. “I don't blame anybody for that.”It's a scary time for documentarians. Will they have to start working with the likes of Brett Ratner to make infomercials that please Donald Trump to pay the bills? The success of “Melania” suggests they might.

Other streamers like Apple, whose CEO Tim Cook attended the White House premiere of “Melania,” could potentially turn their back on the documentary community and attempt to make current event, politically minded documentaries disappear. HBO and Netflix are holdouts. Both companies still support social issue films that tackle politics. 

 










HBO's “The Alabama Solution,” a hard-hitting exposé of the brutal Alabama state prison system, and Netflix's “The Perfect Neighbor,” a film that takes aim at America's stand-your-ground laws, both received Oscar nominations in the best feature documentary category this year.” Later this year, fingers crossed, HBO will release Alex Gibney's Elon Musk documentary “Musk.”Without timely documentaries that confront power and interrogate the truth, there's a vacuum to be filled with propaganda.

Here's something notable: new marketing materials for Antoine Fuqua‘s long-awaited Michael Jackson film (just “Michael”) are playing up a specific time frame. Phrases like “early solo career” and “this is where his story begins” stand out in both the film's latest trailer and a brand-new poster.

On one hand, focusing on a more compact period of time in an iconic artist's life is smart, simply for the sake of running time. On the other, well, for someone like Jackson, it offers the chance to skirt around the darker elements of his personal life. What aren't we going to see in “Michael”? Well, considering it stars his own nephew Jaafar Jackson and is leaning so hard into the early stuff, we hazard to guess: quite a bit.

Per the film's official synopsis, it “is the cinematic portrayal of the life and legacy of one of the most influential artists the world has ever known. The film tells the story of Michael Jackson's life beyond the music, tracing his journey from the discovery of his extraordinary talent as the lead of the Jackson Five, to the visionary artist whose creative ambition fueled a relentless pursuit to become the biggest entertainer in the world. Highlighting both his life off-stage and some of the most iconic performances from his early solo career, the film gives audiences a front-row seat to Michael Jackson as never before. This is where his story begins.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The film also stars Nia Long, Laura Harrier, Juliano Valdi, Miles Teller, and Colman Domingo, all of whom pop in its latest trailer (Domingo and Long, as Michael's conflicted parents, really shine).

As IndieWire previously reported, the film has already endured a massive legal snafu involving a big chunk of the movie, which reportedly centered on a child molestation accuser's lawsuit that the Jackson estate was not allowed to depict on film, forced filmmakers to completely reshoot and retool parts of the film, leading to it to be delayed for months indefinitely. 

Footage from the movie was even confidently teased at CinemaCon back in 2024 but was completely absent this past spring as the movie underwent its reshoots. That wait is over now, and this film has the chance to be one of the bigger box office smashes of 2026.

Lionsgate will release “Michael” in theaters (including IMAX) on Friday, April 24.

When the young writer Daphne du Maurier (Laird) arrives, Danni is drawn into a clandestine and intoxicating affair. For one, it is an all-consuming love; for the other, an awakening of long-suppressed desires. Their fragile secret threatens to unravel under the watchful gaze of Adelaide (Bonham Carter), Lord Grenville-Whithers' calculating niece.

	 “Rose Tremain has written a brilliant screenplay which is dark and surprising and mysterious, and we look forward to making a film which lives up to its promise,” Eyre said in a statement. 


	Julia Taylor-Stanley added: “Assembling a cast of such calibre speaks to the power of Rose's storytelling, and to Richard's standing amongst the great British directors. We are excited to be working with our talent on bringing this compelling story to the screen.”

Former Sundance festival director Tabitha Jackson has a brand-new gig, and it's one close to her heart (and home). Film Forum and its Board of Directors today announced that Jackson has been named director of Film Forum, beginning Monday, February 23, 2026.

Per today's press release, “Jackson is an industry veteran with over 30 years of experience in independent and non-profit media, both in the U.S. and her native England. She joins Film Forum energized by two years of research fellowships with MIT Open Documentary Lab, the Royal Shakespeare Company, Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy; and a Rockefeller Foundation residency; in which she considered both the current state of institutional trust, and mediated reality and its implications for the documentary project.”

Jackson's resume is long and eclectic, including a background in researching, producing, and directing. At Channel4, the UK's second public broadcaster, she served as a Commissioning Editor for Arts and Performance and Animation, and as an Executive Producer for Film4. 

In 2013, she became director of the Sundance Institute's Documentary Film Program, “where she oversaw non-fiction film from development to distribution, championing hundreds of documentary filmmakers, growing program funding, and implementing a more expansive artist-driven institutional approach to the art of nonfiction.”

In 2020, Jackson was named director of the Sundance Film Festival. In June 2022, two years after assuming the position after the departure of long-time festival director John Cooper, Jackson stepped down from her role at Sundance. She had, quite notably, led the festival through two pandemic-era virtual-only festivals. In September 2022, IndieWire's own co-founder Eugene Hernandez took over the role, where he continues to this day.

 










Film Forum has also been through some leadership changes in recent years. In January 2023, long-time head Karen Cooper stepped down after 51 years of steering the theater. She was succeeded by Sonya Chung, who took over the role in July 2023, and stepped down from the position at the end of 2025, after two years.

The national search for Film Forum's next director was led by a committee headed by Film Forum Board Chair Gray Coleman (Partner, Davis Wright Tremaine LLP) and HR professional Stella Strazdas (together, the executive committee of the board), facilitated by Edie Demas, Vice President, Organizational Strategy and Brenna Thomas, Search Consultant, at TOC Arts Partners.

“After a search process involving a large number of extremely qualified candidates, our board of directors and staff quickly reached a strong consensus around Tabitha, and it's no surprise, given her passion for film and history of strong management in the non-profit arts arena,” said Coleman in an official statement. “Plus she is a longtime resident of Greenwich Village and has spent years attending screenings and events at Film Forum.”

For Jackson, the move seems to be a very good fit indeed. “Independent nonprofit arthouse cinema' — those four words distill everything I've championed throughout my career. That they also describe Film Forum, my local movie theater, makes this appointment feel like coming home,” said Jackson in her own statement. “For 56 years, Film Forum has built a national and international reputation for bold curation, unparalleled repertory programming, fiercely loyal audiences — and legendary banana bread. It is an honor to step into the world built by my predecessors Karen Cooper and Sonya Chung, Artistic Directors Bruce Goldstein and Mike Maggiore, Managing Director Chad Bolton, and the rest of the incredible Film Forum staff and board, and a privilege to lead this vital space into its next chapter. Because Film Forum is where art becomes civic life — where a film can start a debate, transform the way we see, or simply remind us we're not alone in the dark.”

 










Jackson has won numerous awards, including an Emmy Award for her producing work, the Leading Light Award at the DOC NYC Visionaries Tribute in 2018, and was presented with the Trustees Award by the Grierson Trust in 2021. She is a voting member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and served three terms on the Documentary Branch Executive Committee.

Savannah Guthrie was absent from Today on Feb. 2 as she works with local authorities in Arizona to find her mother, Nancy Guthrie, who was last seen on Jan. 31. Nancy is 84 years old and considered a “missing vulnerable adult” due to her age, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department.


	In her absence, Guthrie provided a statement that was shared by her co-anchors Craig Melvin and Sheinelle Jones. “On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers, and messages of support,” she said. “Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom. We thank law enforcement for their hard work on this case and encourage anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff's office at 520-351-4900.”


	In a news conference held on Feb. 1, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos provided further details about the case. “The scene at the house also has some concerns for us, as well,” Nanos told KVOA in Tucson. “We don't typically get the sheriff out at a scene like this, but it's very concerning what we're learning from the house. Our homicide team is out right now looking at the scene as well.” Nanos explained to reporters that missing person reports of this kind come in often, but this one stood out specifically due to the description of the scene, which has not been shared with the public.

	











	On Feb. 2, Nanos appeared at another news conference with updates on the search. “We do in fact have a crime scene,” he said, noting that there is reason to believe Nancy did not leave home on her own volition. “I need this community to step up and start giving us some calls.”

	The missing person report shared by the Pima County Sheriff's Department describes Nancy as being 5 feet 5 inches tall with a weight of 150 pounds, brown hair, and blue eyes. She was last seen near her residence near East Skyline Drive and North Campbell Avenue. Concerns about her well-being were raised after a member of her church contacted a family member when she didn't show up for services. 


	Authorities do not know what she was wearing at the time she went missing, but noted that she is not in good physical health and requires daily medication. The Guthrie family reported to authorities that Nancy does not suffer from any cognitive issues. “This is not dementia related. She's as sharp as a tack,” Nanos said. “The family wants everyone to know that this isn't someone who just wandered off.”

	“Our thoughts and prayers are with Savannah and her family,” Today anchor Al Rocker shared on social media. Guthrie has highlighted her close relationship with her mother on previous episodes, including a segment that celebrated Nancy's milestone 80th birthday. 


	“She has met unthinkable challenges in her life with grit, without self-pity, with determination, and always, always with unshakeable faith,” Savannah said in 2022. “She loves us, her family, fiercely, and her selflessness and sacrifice for us, her steadfastness and her unmovable confidence is the reason any of us grew up to do anything.”

Disney has the right to buy back the NFL's stake beginning in July 2034, with the league holding an option to acquire more of ESPN.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


ESPN is valued at about $30 billion, with the National Football League's 10 percent equity stake in the sports media giant securing an estimated fair market value of $3 billion, according to The Walt Disney Co.'s latest quarterly earnings report.


	Disney and the NFL closed their mega deal in the last week, giving the league its non-controlling interest, leaving Disney with 72 percent, and Hearst with 18 percent. According to the company's 10-Q, Disney will have an option to reacquire the NFL's stake in ESPN after July 2034, based on the division's performance, in exchange for a ten-year note at 70 percent of the then fair market value of the NFL's interest in ESPN. The league, meanwhile, has an option to acquire an additional 4 percent of ESPN on a similar timetable, also at 70 percent market value.

	The deal will see ESPN fully own NFL Network, with plans to bake it into the ESPN streaming service. The RedZone channel, meanwhile, will join Disney's linear portfolio, with Disney also planning to merge its ESPN fantasy football product with NFL Media's fantasy product. The NFL will also license games, RedZone, NFL Films programming and other content and rights to ESPN, with the sports media company also securing rights to the RedZone brand to use for other sports.

	Perhaps most importantly, Disney will be getting the exclusive games that had lived with NFL Network, giving it more inventory.

	











	Disney is expected to integrate the NFL's media assets in the coming weeks and months.


	“We're really happy that we were able to close it when we did, that enables us to get started sooner than we actually had anticipated,” Disney CEO Bob Iger told Wall Street analysts Monday. “So the upcoming NFL season, which will end in ESPN first Super Bowl is a huge opportunity for ESPN, not only in terms of its ability to manage the NFL Network and RedZone, but also with more NFL inventory. And we know how valuable that is, and how valuable it will be, particularly for ESPN streaming business.”


	The quarter also revealed just how vulnerable ESPN remains to the pay-TV ecosystem. All of Disney's channels, including ESPN, were dark for weeks on YouTube TV last quarter, the company's longest blackout in its history. The company disclosed a $110 million hit to operating income due to the blackout, underscoring how reliant ESPN remains to the ecosystem, even after launching its standalone streaming platform last year.


	Per Disney's fiscal Q1 earnings report, the sports division (which is almost entirely comprised of ESPN) had revenue of $4.9 billion and operating income of $191 million.

Disney CEO Bob Iger spoke at length on the prospects of parks and entertainment as they vie for top billing at the company in terms of growth, telling investors on a call after earnings that “we have a healthy competition now in our company in terms of which of those two businesses is going to essentially prevail as the number one driver of profitability.”


	“But I'm confident that both have that ability. Meaning both have the ability to grow nicely into the future, given all the investments that we've made and the trajectory that we're on,” he said.


	The comments, in response to a question asking him to asses the two core businesses come as the board could announce Iger's replacement as CEO as soon as this week. Parks & Experiences chief Josh D'Amaro is reportedly in pole position. Dana Walden, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, has also been considered a front runner.

	“f you go all the way back to 2005, when I became CEO, the return on invested capital in the theme parks and resorts business was not impressive, and actually not acceptable. And we also had not that much building in progress, meaning there wasn't much expansion — but maybe for good reason, because the return of invested capital was so low,” Iger said. “As we added IP to our stable, including Pixar in '06 and Marvel in '09, and LucasFilm in 2012, and ultimately 20th Century Fox, we gained access to intellectual property that had real value in terms of parks and resorts, and enabled us to lean into more capital spending because of the confidence level we had in improving returns on invested capital due to the popularity of that IP,” Iger said.

	“And when you look at the footprint of the business today, it's never been more broad or more diverse, and the projects that we have underway are going to make it even more so. We're expanding in every place we operate, and additionally, having been in Abu Dhabi just two weeks ago, was reminded how great the potential is to build in that part of the world. Because not only is it strategically located to reach a huge population that have never visited our parks, but we built in one of the most modern and technologically advanced ways. So, you know, as I look ahead, I actually am very, very bullish on that business and its ability to grow.”


	The trajectory of streaming looks strong, as does film, with post post strong results for Disney's fiscal first quarter ended in September. “We know that's in the pipeline,” he said. “Looking back just a few years, our movie business was suffering from Covid, and the streaming business was obviously not an acceptable place.” Now, he said, the future of both Entertainment and Parks “are bright.”


	Disney reported just under $24.7 billion in revenue and just over $5 billion in operating profit last quarter. Parks & Experiences accounted for about 40% of the former (or$9.4 billion) and 60% of the latter (or $3.11 billion).

	Full trailer for Lionsgate's Michael Jackson biopic Michael is here as we approach April 24 release date.


	“You are confident. You are strong. You are beautiful. You are the greatest of all time,” the trailer begins as we see the King of Pop elevate from nothing to something overlaid with a soundtrack featuring several of his catchiest tunes.


	The movie stars Jackson's nephew Jaafar Jackson in the titular role. He can be seen singing, dancing and being elevated to superstardom through the two minute 16 second trailer.


Antoine Fuqua‘s Michael also stars Miles Teller as Jackson's attorney and adviser John Branca, Colman Domingo as his father Joe Jackson, Nia Long as his mother Katherine Jackson, Jessica Sula as his sister LaToya Jackson, Larenz Tate as Motown Records founder Berry Gordy, Laura Harrier as pioneering music executive Suzanne de Passe, Kat Graham as Diana Ross and Juliano Valdi as Jackson 5-era Michael Jackson.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The biopic is set to be released in theaters on April 24. There has been plenty of speculation about its release and delays. It's still not clear from the synopsis or trailer whether the film will touch on any of the controversies that met the superstar later in life. The trailer drops two days before a UK documentary that will air previously unheard audio recordings from Jackson discussing his feelings towards children.


	The synopsis reads: Michael tells the story of Michael Jackson's life beyond the music, tracing his journey from the discovery of his extraordinary talent as the lead of the Jackson Five, to the visionary artist whose creative ambition fueled a relentless pursuit to become the biggest entertainer in the world. Highlighting both his life off-stage and some of the most iconic performances from his early solo career, the film gives audiences a front-row seat to Michael Jackson as never before. This is where his story begins.”

Bad Bunny conquered the Grammys last night and is on track to conquer the Super Bowl halftime show stage this coming weekend, so the knights of Westeros and the financial bandits of London have already laid down their swords. HBO has confirmed that instead of trying to compete directly with the Super Bowl, its two major Sunday evening series, Industry and A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms, will become available a little bit early via HBO Max. 

While both episodes will still air linearly on Sunday evening in their regular time slots, the fifth episode of Industry‘s current season and the fourth episode of A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms will debut on HBO Max on Friday, February 6 at 3:01 am ET/12:01 am PT. Adjust your watch parties accordingly! 

HBO pulled a similar move in 2024, sharing that year's episode of True Detective: Night Country on Friday night so people wouldn't have to choose between watching a corpsicle thaw and footage of Taylor Swift and Ice Spice watching the Chiefs best the 49ers. Beside Bad Bunny, the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks will also be at this year's Super Bowl, a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 that presumably won't include Left Shark this time. Kickoff for that is at 6:30 ET.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's wife, Sarah Ferguson, made a crude comment about their daughter Princess Eugenie in an email to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

On Friday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released millions of files related to its criminal investigations into the late child sex offender.

In one email, Ferguson — formerly Sarah, Duchess of York — was contacted by Epstein in March 2010, two years after he was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute.

“ny [New York]?” Epstein wrote the mom of two, to which she replied, “Not sure yet. Just waiting for Eugenie to come back from a shagging weekend!!” (Shagging is a British slang term for sexual intercourse.)

Eugenie, now 35, was two days away from turning 20 when the emails between her mom and Epstein were exchanged. Per the Mirror, the princess brought in her big day with her then-boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank. (Eugenie and Brooksbank tied the knot in 2018.)

Ferguson also shares daughter Princess Beatrice, 37, with Andrew, 65, who was stripped of his royal titles last October due to his ties to pedophile Epstein.

“His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew,” Buckingham Palace told Page Six in a statement at the time.

“His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.”

The statement continued, “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.

“Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”

Andrew was accused of sexual abuse by Virginia Giuffre, who recently died by suicide.

Meanwhile, Ferguson also faced consequences for her ties to Epstein.

Last September, Julia's House, a children's hospice charity, cut ties with the British author after her emailed apology to the child rapist leaked.

The Daily Mail revealed at the time that Ferguson reached out to Epstein in April 2011 to “humbly apologize” for calling their friendship a “gigantic error of judgment” in an Evening Standard interview.

 “I know you feel hellaciously let down by me from what you were either told or read,” she wrote to Epstein.

Ferguson then called the convicted sex offender a “steadfast, generous and supreme friend.”

The entertainment industry is mourning the loss of beloved actress Catherine O'Hara, who passed away on January 30. O'Hara leaves behind a loving family and an incredible career. Many actors who knew her or worked with her have paid tribute, including a heartfelt statement from her on-screen daughter, Annie Murphy. 

Murphy played Alexis Rose on the popular series, “Schitt's Creek,” which ran for six seasons from 2015 until 2020. O'Hara's was her onscreen mother, Moira Rose. 

Murphy shared several photos of herself and O'Hara on Instagram, and in her caption, she discussed who O'Hara was and how she would be missed. “Ha-ha-HAAAA?!?! Her laugh was a perpetual Yes, And… It challenged anyone who heard it to join in, and be as delighted as she was,” Murphy wrote. “Gosh, were we ever lucky to have her.” 

She ended her message with the hashtag #goodbyetoagreatactress and a wearing sunglasses emoji. “The sunglasses are because I'm in mourning, David!” a fan shared. “Schitt's Creek” was created by Eugene Levy and his son, Dan Levy. David refers to Dan's character on the show, David Rose, who was O'Hara's onscreen son. Eugene played Johnny Rose.

Other rections include, “The greatest mother daughter duo to ever hit the screen,” “The fact that I was watching this show at the moment I found out brought me to tears. She and this show was and still is my happy in these very stressing time. RIP Moira Rose,” and “It's hard to put into words the feeling of this loss. Her work was a meaningful part of so many lives. Thinking of you, her family, and those closest to her.”

O'Hara and Eugene had a friendship that spanned five decades after first meeting in the ‘70s at the Toronto-based improv troupe, Second City. Both Eugene and Dan have penned beautiful tributes for O'Hara as they mourn her loss and celebrate her brilliance. 

“What a gift to have gotten to dance in the warm glow of Catherine O'Hara's brilliance for all those years,” Dan wrote on Instagram. “Having spent over fifty years collaborating with my Dad, Catherine was extended family before she ever played my family. It's hard to imagine a world without her in it. I will cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her. My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke and every member of her big, beautiful family.”

O'Hara had an incredible career with her most recent work on the series “The Studio” and “The Last of Us,” both of which last aired in May 2025. Her death was announced by her rep, who revealed she died at her Los Angeles Bentwood home “following a brief illness,” TMZ reports. She was 71.

Disney reported solid results for its fiscal first quarter but also disclosed a $110 million hit from an autumn carriage fight with YouTube TV.


	Revenue for the quarter ended December 27 ticked up 5% from the year-earlier period to reach $25.98 billion. Diluted earnings per share came in at $1.63, excluding non-recurring items. Wall Street analysts had expected revenue of $25.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.58.


	The numbers were released before the start of Monday's trading day, a window seldom used by media companies to report quarterly earnings. Investors (and Hollywood) are eagerly awaiting a bigger piece of news: the naming of CEO Bob Iger's successor. The Disney board is convening its quarterly meeting this week and is expected to settle on its pick, with Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney's Experiences division, now the betting favorite.

	The Sports division posted operating income of $191 million, down 23% from the year-ago period. The company blamed higher programming and production costs, along with a decrease in subscription and affiliate fees, with those negatives wiping out a 10% rise in ad revenue. The YouTube TV battle, which was resolved in mid-November after a 15-day period when ESPN, ABC and other networks were taken off the leading pay-TV service in the middle of the football season, delivered a $110 million blow to operating income.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Experiences, which includes theme parks, resorts and cruise ships, hit $10 billion in revenue for the first time, with operating income of $3.3 billion. Domestic parks attendance inched up 1% and per-capita spending increased 4% in the period.

	











	In the current quarter, Disney cautioned, income growth in Experiences will be “modest” due to “international visitation headwinds at our domestic parks.” While the company didn't call out the issue specifically, President Trump's tariffs have suppressed tourist visits to the U.S. from a number of countries.


	Entertainment revenue climbed 7% to $11.6 billion, but the number of theatrical releases increased costs, contributing to a 35% drop in operating income in the unit. 


	As the company had signaled before earnings, the quarter included the release of Zootopia 2, Avatar: Fire and Ash, Predator: Badlands and Tron: Ares , compared with just two releases in the prior-year quarter (Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King). That boosted expenses, but the billion-dollar-plus box office for the Zootopia and Avatar sequels will bring benefits in future quarters. 


	Entertainment SVOD operating income, powered by Disney+ and Hulu, soared to $450 million, well ahead of internal projections. Management is projecting it will hit $500 million in the current quarter. Price increases phased in during the October-to-December quarter provided a boost to the streaming results but visibility on growth is limited. Disney, following in Netflix's footsteps, has stopped reporting subscriber numbers on a quarterly basis, and also no longer discloses the widely tracked metric of average revenue per user.


	Iger nodded to his second stint as CEO, which began in November 2022, in the earnings release. (The first one lasted from 2005 to 2020.) “As we continue to manage our company for the future, I am incredibly proud of all that we've accomplished over the past three years,” he said.

Disney sports took a hit because sports fans like myself are tired of ESPN political commentators – if I want to listen to politics there are other channels for that.

"When you're performing at the Grammys and all you hear is this in your ears," he wrote on Instagram following his performance.

Alex Warren has addressed technical difficulties that affected his performance at the Grammy Awards on Sunday night.


	The singer-songwriter, who was nominated for Best New Artist, experienced apparent in-ear monitor issues during his televised performance of “Ordinary,” which was broadcast live from Los Angeles. Viewers noted audio irregularities as Warren appeared to struggle with his earpiece while performing.


	Following the ceremony, Warren responded on Instagram, sharing a video that demonstrated what he said he was hearing during the performance. “When you're performing at the Grammys and all you hear is this in your ears,” he wrote, alongside distorted and delayed audio from the track. He added in a separate caption, “This would only happen to me…”

	During the performance, Warren was seen adjusting his in-ear pack and eventually removing one of the monitors, while briefly falling out of sync with the backing track. The nature of the technical malfunction has not been formally addressed by the Recording Academy or broadcast partner CBS.

	











	Despite the setback, the appearance marked Warren's first on-stage performance at the Grammys. He was nominated for Best New Artist following a breakout year that included the success of “Ordinary.”




	The award ultimately went to Olivia Dean, who capped off a year that included major festival appearances and the release of her album The Art of Loving.


	As of publication, representatives for Warren and the Recording Academy have not issued further comment regarding the technical issues.

In a lengthy post to Truth Social, Trump criticized the Grammys, the broadcast network CBS, and Trevor Noah.

Donald Trump has publicly lashed out at the Grammy Awards following jokes made during the broadcast, calling the ceremony “virtually unwatchable” and threatening legal action against host Trevor Noah.

	“That's a Grammy that every artist wants — almost as much as Trump wants Greenland,” Noah joked as Billie Eilish was announced as the winner for Song of the Year. “Which makes sense because, since Epstein's gone, he needs a new island to hang out with Bill Clinton. I told you, it's my last year! What are you going to do about it?”

	In a lengthy post shared on Truth Social late Sunday, Trump criticized the Grammys, the broadcast network CBS, and Noah, after the comedian made a remark referencing Trump and Bill Clinton in connection with Jeffrey Epstein.


	“The Grammy Awards are the WORST, virtually unwatchable!” Trump wrote. “CBS is lucky not to have this garbage litter their airwaves any longer.”


	Trump went on to dispute Noah's comment directly, writing: “Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!! I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory statement, have never been accused of being there, not even by the Fake News Media.”

	











	The president continued his criticism of Noah's hosting, adding: “The host, Trevor Noah, whoever he may be, is almost as bad as Jimmy Kimmel at the Low Ratings Academy Awards… Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast.”


	Trump also suggested potential legal action, writing that he would be “sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C., and suing him for plenty$,” before concluding: “Get ready Noah, I'm going to have some fun with you!”


	Neither the Recording Academy nor representatives for Noah have publicly responded to Trump's remarks at the time of publication.


	The Grammys, which aired Sunday night, were hosted by Noah for the sixth consecutive year, with the comedian continuing his tradition of opening monologues that referenced politics, pop culture, and current events.

The singer, writer and producer landed record of the year for Kendrick Lamar and SZA's 'Luther.' 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


Jack Antonoff has entered from rare Grammy air. 


	The singer, songwriter and producer became just the fourth person to win all four major categories — album, record, song of the year and best new artist — which he completed at Sunday's show.




	Antonoff was only missing record of the year, which he won for producing “Luther” from Kendrick Lamar and SZA at the 2026 Grammy Awards; he also had a second chance at the award for producing fellow record nominee “Manchild,” from Sabrina Carpenter.

	He had previously won best new artist as a member of the group Fun, along with song of the year for the band's hit tune “We are Young.” He also has three album of the year wins as a frequent collaborator of Taylor Swift, for her albums 1989, Folklore and Midnights.

	











	The only other musicians who have completed that “Big Four” feat are Christopher Cross, Billie Eilish and Adele; Cross (in 1981) and Eilish (in 2020) were both able to achieve all four major wins in one night.  


	Antonoff was up for seven awards at Sunday's show, with 11 previous total wins coming into the evening. He joined Lamar, SZA and their producing team on stage for the record of the year win but didn't take a turn at the mic; instead, SZA took a moment to say amid the current political moment, “Please don't fall into despair. I know that right now is a scary time; I know the algorithm is telling us that it's so scary and all is lost. There's been world wars, there's been plagues and we have gone on. We can go on, we need each other, we need to trust each other and trust ourselves, trust our heart. We're not governed by the government, we're governed by God.”

The Soft Pink Truth began as a lark and a provocation—an invitation to cut rugs and undercut binaries in one fell swoop. Drew Daniel's debut album under the alias, 2003's Do You Party?, operated on multiple levels: A rejoinder to the (straight, white) seriousness of the experimental dance scene, it slipped funk, rap, and disco into a subversive take on glitch-techno aesthetics. The following year, the more expressly conceptual Do You Want New Wave or Do You Want the Soft Pink Truth? reimagined punk classics from groups like Crass, Minor Threat, and Angry Samoans as insouciant electro-pop bangers, erasing the divide between Daniel's hardcore youth and his electronic adulthood while queering the punk-rock canon. A decade later, Why Do the Heathen Rage? took similar liberties with black metal, gleefully torching underground music's ultimate temple to genre purism.

But the project has taken on a distinctly utopian tenor in the 2020s. The music has gotten deeper and sweeter; jokey gambits and herky-jerky sounds have fallen away, replaced by a rapturous fusion of deep house and ambient. You can trace the influence of artists like Moodymann, Matthew Herbert, and DJ Sprinkles, but Soft Pink Truth's last two albums—2020's Shall We Go On Sinning So That Grace May Increase? and 2022's Is It Going to Get Any Deeper Than This?—are also awash in chamber music, spiritual jazz, free improv, and classical minimalism. A spirit of collective reverence prevails. Both albums feel like illuminated manuscripts advancing the simplest argument ever made: A better world is possible.

A doubtful undertone creeps into his new album, Can Such Delightful Times Go On Forever? The record might be considered the third in a trilogy exploring the importance of community, collectivism, and solidarity, in both joy and defiance. Sinning was expressly framed as a response to Donald Trump's first term as president, a kind of “We Shall Overcome” rooted in the chosen family that Daniel and M.C. Schmidt, his husband and partner in the duo Matmos, have gathered around them over the past three decades. Deeper was more ecstatic, more sensuous. Like those albums, the new one favors human players over machines, but it goes a step further, largely abandoning overtly electronic tropes in favor of an acoustic palette informed by chamber music and film composition. More than merely a formal experiment, it feels like a political choice: a way of expressly centering people, and the relations between them, at a time when our rights and our autonomy are increasingly endangered by the predatory politics of AI.

It's a side of Daniel that we've rarely heard. “Mere Survival Is Not Enough” launches the album on an unabashedly sentimental note, romantic strings cresting in waves before falling away to reveal a plucky melody that would suit the opening credits of an HBO dramedy. The mood turns more contemplative with “And By and By a Cloud Takes All Away,” closer in spirit to the last two Soft Pink Truth records: Rolling piano chords and wordless vocals sketch out the drifting shapes of the title; pulsing saxophones nod to the American minimalist tradition; pitch-bent chords rise vertiginously, mirroring agile harp glissandi. The dimensions are always shifting, acoustic elements smeared into synthetic arrays and back again.

Daniel flexes his compositional chops on “Phrygian Ganymede,” a 10-minute epic in which limpid pools of harp and piano freeze and shatter, giving way to dissonant pizzicato sequences and dramatic bowing; the latter half is a freeform fantasia full of splotchy woodwinds and unsettling dissonance. It sounds like a tribute to the sounds that Daniel absorbed in the art-house movie theater that his stepfather operated in Louisville, Kentucky.

Nearly two dozen players populate the credits, but it's not clear who does what on any given track; by design, the Soft Pink Truth's music subsumes individual voices into a tonal and textural union of broad, swirling shapes. But the emphasis on acoustic timbres also gives this album a more stripped-back feel than its predecessors. Your reaction to that clarity may be a question of taste; confronted with the jagged, almost aggressive string figures of “Time Inside the Violet,” I miss the enveloping nature of Daniel's last two albums, the feeling of floating through a particularly absorbing dream. But the new album does have plenty of buoyant moments—“Orchard,” featuring pastoral acoustic guitar from Bill Orcutt, is a particular highlight, approximating some of the starry-eyed sensory overload of Jim O'Rourke's Bad Timing and Eureka. And in any case, unalloyed pleasure doesn't seem to be the chief concern of this album. True to form for his day job as an academic, Daniel's default mode is to question and provoke. Can Such Delightful Times Go On Forever? feels like an attempt to break out of his comfort zone at a time when there are no easy answers.

When it comes to “The Devil Wears Prada,” Miranda Priestley's opinion is the only one that matters — but longtime fans of director David Frankel and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna's 2006 workplace comedy can rest easy after a promising first look debuted the night of the Grammys. From 20th Century Studios, the upcoming sequel reunites the original storytelling duo with star Meryl Streep, who once again plays the titular fashion editor, Miranda Priestley, who notoriously rules Runway Magazine with a pursed lip.

Rather than escalating Miranda's cool-toned aggression or sharpening her corporate knives, the trailer for “The Devil Wears Prada 2” hints at a dramatic solution that's more elegant and unexpected. Here, Miranda is a woman so powerful she scarcely remembers the events of the first film. When Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) re-enters the sleek offices at Runway, she's not a lost cause or an embittered rival; she's a stranger forced to introduce herself all over again — albeit in better shoes and with no cerulean.

Miranda's offer of employment, positioning Andy as a features editor at the magazine, lands less like an olive branch than a reminder of her former (and maybe future) boss' scale. Andy's life-altering professional ordeal with Miranda registers as little more than a footnote for her. That protective barrier has only strengthened with time, and the returning ensemble subtly reframes her and Andy's imbalance.

 










Ever the loyal steward for Runway's soul, Nigel (Stanley Tucci) is back as Miranda's right flank, while Emily (Emily Blunt) appears more detached from the magazine than ever — offering fleeting glimpses of a broader ecosystem that expands on Miranda's immediate orbit. The effect is clarifying, reminding viewers that Andy was always small potatoes for people who make contemporary culture as we know it.

Is this reunion the prelude to a long-simmering revenge arc, or as it appears here, an unexpected second chapter shaped by time and selective memory? Frankel and McKenna wisely refuse to show their hand, and instead, the teaser leans on nostalgic atmosphere — echoing the original score with another reworked version of Madonna's “Vogue,” and a knowing confidence that already signaled the first movie as an enduring cinematic favorite.

Notably, the trailer keeps its new cast, including Kenneth Branagh, Simone Ashley, Justin Theroux, Lucy Liu, Patrick Brammall, Caleb Hearon, Helen J. Shen, Pauline Chalamet, B.J. Novak, and Conrad Ricamora, largely in the shadows. It does, however, loudly laud the Academy Award wins and nominations of its four returning stars. It's a savvy acknowledgment of just how much talent is concentrated in this fictional corner of Manhattan and a warm invitation to revisit its world with fresh eyes. 

 










But what became of Nate? And what happened to Andy's friends? Is Christian Thompson still skulking around? Some loose threads are best saved for opening weekend. Watch the trailer for “Devil Wears Prada 2,” in theaters from 20th Century Studios on May 1.

	This year's 68th Grammy Awards marked the debut of a new category in the country music field: Best Contemporary Country Album. During Sunday night's ceremonies, Jelly Roll was named the first winner in the category for his album Beautifully Broken.


	After thanking his wife, Bunnie Xo — “I'd have killed myself if it wasn't for you and Jesus” — Jelly Roll recounted his time in prison, in a “6 by 8 foot cell,” and how those dire days informed Beautifully Broken. “There was a time in my life when I was broken. That's why I wrote this album,” he said onstage. “I was a horrible human.”


	Then the man born Jason DeFord went into the proselytizing that has become a signature of his concerts and onstage appearances. “I believed that music had the power to change my life and God had the power to change my life,” he shouted. “Jesus is for everybody. Jesus is not owned by one political party…. Jesus is Jesus. Anybody can have a relationship with him.”

	Jelly Roll faced off against fellow nominees Kelsea Ballerini (Patterns), Tyler Childers (Snipe Hunter), Eric Church (Evangeline vs. the Machine), and Miranda Lambert (Postcards From Texas). Earlier on Sunday, Jelly Roll won another Grammy, for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for “Amen” with Shaboozey. The “A Bar Star (Tipsy)” singer dedicated his Grammy to the “children of immigrants.” “This is also for those who came to this country in search of better opportunity to be a part of a nation that promised freedom for all and equal opportunity to everyone willing to work for it. Thank you for bringing your culture, your music, your stories, and your traditions here,” Shaboozey said. “You give America color.”

	The nominees for Best Traditional Country Album included Margo Price (Hard Headed Woman), Charley Crockett (Dollar a Day), Willie Nelson (Oh What a Beautiful World), Lukas Nelson (American Romance), and the winner, Ain't in It for My Health, by Zach Top.

Bad Bunny took the stage at the 2026 Grammy Awards to accept the award for Best Música Urbana Album for his LP DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, but he wasn't interested in the glitz and glamour of the ceremony in that moment. He used the entirety of his speech to call out ICE raids and cruel anti-immigrant rhetoric. 


	“Before I say, ‘Thank God,' I'm going to say, ‘ICE out,'” Bad Bunny said. “We're not savage. We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.” 


	His speech came after host Trevor Noah approached the artist at his table earlier in the night and jokingly asked if Puerto Rico could serve as a refuge for Americans if things got bad in the country. Bad Bunny responded with a fairly deadpanned tone, reminding him that Puerto Rico is part of the U.S.

	Many artists showed up to the Grammys wearing “ICE Out” pins on the red carpet and praising immigrants in their acceptance speeches throughout the night. Their gestures served as a reminder of the violence and force both immigrants and U.S. citizens are facing at the hands of ICE.

	











	“I want to say to the people, I know it's tough not to hate these days,” Bad Bunny continued. “The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. So, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love. We don't hate them. We love our people, we love our family, and that's the way to do it — with love. Don't forget that, please.”

The Biebers are bringing their swag to the red carpet. 

Justin Bieber back made a triumphant return to the awards show circuit, hitting the Grammys 2026 red carpet with wife Hailey Bieber.

The pop star, 31, opted for an oversized black Balenciaga suit paired with a dazzling diamond tennis necklace by Lorraine Schwartz featuring 100 carats of diamonds.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Bieber coordinated with her husband in a strapless black Alaïa dress featuring large sheer panels on her legs.

The model accessorized with massive diamonds, too, including a silver collar necklace with a 30-carat pear-shaped diamond, matching 20-carat earrings and a 12-carat ring — all also by Schwartz.

The couple also made a statement with their accessories, wearing anti-ICE pins reading “ICE OUT.” (They're not the only stars sporting political pins for the award show, as many others including Kehlani wore the same button on the red carpet, in addition to boldly condemning Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in an interview.)

Bieber is anticipated to have a big night as he's nominated for four awards — including album of the year for “Swag,” up against Lady Gaga, Bad Bunny, Kendrick Lamar, Sabrina Carpenter and more.

He's also set to take the stage for his first major performance in four years.

The couple last appeared at the Grammys in 2022, when the “Yummy” singer turned up in a pink beanie with his suit while the Rhode founder chose a slinky Saint Laurent slip dress.

It's sure to be a big year for Bieber, who is set to headline Coachella in April alongside Sabrina Carpenter, Karol G and Anyma.

While the Biebers have had marriage struggles in recent times — which Justin sings about on his albums “Swag” and “Swag II” in songs like “Daisies” and “Walking Away” — sources say Hailey was the “driving force” behind his decision to perform at the music festival.

The “incredibly supportive” model, 29, reportedly “assured” her husband that “now is the best time” to take the stage again.

We're sure she'll be hyping him up during his performance, too.

Longtime Hallmark star Marcus Rosner just landed his biggest role yet: DAD! On February 1, 2026, the Canadian actor and producer announced the surprise news via social media with his wife, Ali Kroeker, thrilling fans and colleagues. 

Sharing a precious black and white photo of their baby boy grasping onto each of their thumbs, Rosner wrote, “Our Boy. M.R.R. January, 2026”

Rosner, who joined the cast of “Sullivan's Crossing” in 2025, has been married to Kroeker, an independent filmmaker, for four years. 

“The Love Club” star, 36, shared their baby announcement in his Instagram Stories and sweetly wrote, “Welcome, my boy. All I know right now is you will never wonder where I am. The rest we'll figure out as we go.”

The photo Rosner and Kroeker shared reveals a tattoo on his hand that says “Be Here Now.” Several months before his son's birth, in October, he shared in a social media video that he'd been reflecting on wanting to be more intentional about telling stories that matter to him, like the fact he was “born to a 15-year-old mother” and didn't grow up with “soft problems” like many of his characters have had. 

Noting that he's been “very fortunate” to appear in many TV shows and movies, Rosner said, “Recently, something's just been growing in me where I have this feeling that I haven't really used this craft to tell my stories — the ones that shaped me, the ones that might make me feel understood. And for years, I was caught in this cycle of just making the next thing, projects that come and go, and experiences flying by at the speed of light.” 

Rosner continued, “It was thrilling, and I was addicted to that cycle, and I was grateful for it, but lately I've been slowing down and taking the time to make things that might actually last, even if they only matter to me.”

The surprise baby news thrilled Rosner's famous friends, including Erin Krakow, whom he's known since playing Charles Kensington on “When Calls The Heart” in 2015. Krakow, who's expecting her own bundle of joy with fellow WCTH star Ben Rosenbaum, commented on Rosner's post, “Look at this precious soul! Congratulations!!!”

Rosner's close friend and “The Love Club” co-star Brittany Bristow chimed in, “Friggen perfect little man. ❤️” and “The Christmas Baby” director Eva Tavares exclaimed, “WHATTTTT AHHHHHH CONGRATS❤️❤️❤️❤️”

“Hope Valley: 1874” star Chelsea Hobbs wrote, “OMG Whaaaaaaaat 🙌❤️ 😭 congrats you two!!!!”

Hallmark alum Cindy Busby, who co-starred with Rosner in the 2019 Lifetime thriller “The Killer Downstairs,” wrote, “Awwww!!! What a lucky lil guy!!! Congratulations 🥳 👏😍❤️”

Young actress Skywalker Hughes, who filmed the yet-to-be-released “Uphill for Christmas” with Rosner, commented, “Ahhhhh yes!!!!!! Huge congratulations 🥳 ❤️ you'll be an amazing dad MARCUS I know!!! signed, your tv daughter!!!! Ahhhh 🙌🙌🙌 so exciitngnnnnnnnn”

Fans flooded Rosner and Kroeker's post with words of congratulations, too, thrilled by their surprise baby news. 

Congratulations Marcus & Ali On The Birth Of Your Precious Baby Boy! I Am So Happy & Excited For You Both! I Hope Mommy & Baby Are Both Doing Well. You Are In For The Absolute Best “Ride” Of Your Lives! Wishing You ALL Much Happiness & Love, Good Health, Fun & Laughter, Many Blessings And Special Moments! All The Best! Sending Love & Hugs. Chris V. 💙🎉🎈🍾👣

Country singer Garth Brooks has publicly mourned the loss of his publicist, Nancy Seltzer, whom he cared for. 

Brooks honored Seltzer with a lengthy post on his official website. Titled “​​Nancy Seltzer Has Passed — Quiet Hollywood Giant Leaves Legacy of Integrity and Class,” the post features a photo of Seltzer and a comment about who she was and what she did. 

“Public relations legend Nancy Seltzer passed away after a brief hospital stay this week, leaving behind a legacy that shaped decades of entertainment history — often quietly, always with integrity, dogged determination, and purpose,” the statement reads. 

The statement commented on Seltzer's career and celebrity clients, who included Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Robert Downey Jr., and Whitney Houston. “She worked at the highest levels of Hollywood, even running the Academy Awards red carpet for many years,” the statement reads. “She navigated moments of triumph and vulnerability with a steady hand and unwavering discretion.” 

Although much of Seltzer's work was behind the scenes, she was hugely beneficial to her clients. She always had their best interests at heart. “She wore publicist black like a uniform and kept the focus exactly where she believed it belonged: on her clients,” the statement reads. “Her integrity was contagious, her protective instincts were legendary — maternal, fierce, and unflinching. Her wisdom, earned through decades of experience, was unmatched. Those who worked alongside her understood the gravitas that she carried — and the grace with which she carried it.”

The statement also includes a message from Brooks. “Public relations is the hardest job in show business,” he said. “She always handled every situation with the utmost class.” It is unclear how much of the message on his website he wrote. However, it is clear that Seltzer meant enough to him to share the news of her passing with a message that is an undeniable celebration of her life and her career. 

The statement ends with a powerful message: “In an industry built on visibility, Nancy Seltzer chose discretion. In a business driven by ego, she led with loyalty. And in moments that demanded strength, she offered calm. Her absence will be deeply felt — not only for what she did, but for how she did it.”

Seltzer died on Wednesday, January 28, in Los Angeles, Variety reports. She was 79. Her firm shared a touching statement about her integrity as a publicist. “Ms. Seltzer was particularly known for her extraordinary trust. She created long lasting friendships with people from all over the world to whom she was also wonderful, kind, caring and fiercely loyal,” they shared.

JFK was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas.

Is the federal government in possession of a tape that could blow the John F. Kennedy assassination wide open?

JFK, the 35th President of the United States, was shot and killed in Dallas on November 22, 1963. The assassination shocked the nation to its core.

The official story is that Lee Harvey Oswald acted as a lone gunman. Oswald was later murdered by Jack Ruby before facing a trial.

The infamous assassination has long been tied to conspiracy theories. The most notable is that there were multiple shooters, and a mysterious tape might shine a light on what happened that dark day in Dallas.

The New York Post published a fascinating piece on Sunday about the existence of a mysterious tape that captured the killing.

The tape was shot in Dallas by Orville Nix and was handed over to be analyzed in 1978. It's now believed it's under federal control, but the federal government denies having it, according to the New York Post's report.

There is now a legal battle unfolding over the tape. The Post reported a federal judge has ruled the case can proceed, and that is a step towards the footage becoming public. Nix's granddaughter, Linda Gayle Nix Jackson, also believes the tape could be worth up to $900 million, and the family's fight for it centers on the government taking it without proper compensation.

The tape could prove to be critical for one shockingly simple reason:

Nix had his camera pointed at the infamous grassy knoll as the shots ripped into the sitting President.

The grassy knoll has long been believed by some people to be the location of a second shooter, if such a person ever existed to begin with.

No clear footage has ever been released giving the public a good idea of what was happening on the grassy knoll.

If it's true that Nix's tape can still be found, and it was pointing at the grassy knoll, then it would be a game-changing development.

It would either show something sinister or show nothing on the knoll. Either way, it could be the missing piece of evidence needed to rule out or confirm the most popular conspiracy theory.

Every single piece of evidence and information tied to the JFK assassination should be made public. Maybe it proves nothing. Maybe something is found. Either way, the public deserves to see it all. Let me know what you think at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

We are delighted to announce that renowned spiritual medium Simon Goodfellow will be joining us at Blundell Park on Tuesday 31st March for a special Psychic Supper in McMenemy's.

Highly respected for his unique and uplifting approach to mediumship, Simon works closely with his Spirit Guides to help people find clarity, comfort, and direction. His demonstrations are warm, engaging, and often filled with humour – challenging the “doom and gloom” sometimes associated with mediumship and instead offering a positive and reassuring experience when connecting with loved ones.

What sets Simon apart is his distinctive style. Rather than calling spirits forward, he moves to greet the spirit standing beside their loved one in the audience, delivering messages with authenticity and compassion.

The quiet town of Varginha in Brazil has long been associated with whispers of extraterrestrial activity, but nothing prepared the world for the claim of Dr Italo Venturelli, a prominent neurosurgeon, who insists he performed surgery on a living alien.

His testimony adds a startling new dimension to the infamous 1996 Varginha UFO incident, a case often described as 'Brazil's Roswell'. For decades, the story has divided scientists, UFO researchers and sceptics, but Venturelli's account has reignited debate about whether humanity may have already encountered life beyond Earth.

In a startling revelation, Venturelli described being face-to-face with a sentient, intelligent being in 1996, shedding new light on the infamous Varginha UFO incident and sparking debate among scientists, UFO enthusiasts, and sceptics alike.

According to Venturelli, the encounter began after a mysterious object crashed near the town in January 1996. While driving early one morning, local pilot Carlos de Souza witnessed a cylindrical craft, initially mistaken for a blimp, losing and then regaining altitude before it finally crashed in an open field. De Souza rushed to the site, observing unusual debris that was lightweight, metallic, and strangely resilient, unlike anything he had seen before.

Within minutes, a military convoy arrived, sealing off the area. De Souza recalled being threatened by armed soldiers who ordered him to leave immediately, warning him never to speak about what he had witnessed. The crash site was near a river, close to where local children later reported seeing small, unusual creatures, a discovery that would fuel months of UFO investigations in the region.

Dr Venturelli has now claimed he was called to treat a living alien recovered from the crash. Speaking in a rare interview, he described the being as highly intelligent and aware, with control over its surroundings despite the trauma. 'The creature was conscious, it understood what was happening, and it was not afraid,' Venturelli said. The neurosurgeon reportedly spent three to four minutes in direct contact with the being, performing a delicate procedure while ensuring the alien remained alive.

He also revealed that a video of the procedure exists, though it remains in private hands. 'Many of these witnesses were hounded for decades to come forward, and none have profited from their testimony,' Venturelli explained, emphasising the credibility of the accounts collected over years of investigation.

Multiple witnesses corroborate the incident, including the local chief of police, nurses, farmers, and even the former mayor, who acknowledged the crash publicly. Samples of soil and vegetation taken from the crash site were later tested, showing chemical residues unlike any known substances. The craft itself resembled the so-called Tic Tac UFOs seen in other incidents, such as the 2004 Nimitz encounter in the United States, suggesting striking similarities between extraterrestrial events worldwide.

Over the years, dedicated researchers like James Fox have compiled detailed records of the Varginha case, including testimonies, photographs, and film recordings. These accounts paint a consistent picture of extraordinary events, from the behaviour of the alien beings to the immediate military response, including the secrecy surrounding the removal of the craft and its passengers.

Despite widespread scepticism and ridicule from mainstream media, particularly a notorious broadcast by Rede Globo in Brazil, witnesses remain steadfast in their claims. Venturelli explained that exposure to the story brought personal ridicule, yet he maintained the truth of his experience.

The Varginha incident remains an open secret locally, commemorated by a statue in the town and continually investigated by UFO enthusiasts around the world.

'All of these testimonies should serve as a rallying cry to continue gathering evidence,' Venturelli insisted. As the world absorbs these revelations, the possibility of contact with extraterrestrial life moves from science fiction to a question of history, science, and human curiosity, leaving both believers and sceptics grappling with one simple question: could life from another world truly have been touched by human hands?

When you picture a virtual reality headset user, you're probably not picturing someone like Sherry Dickson. At 69, the snowy-haired, retired elementary school teacher hops into her Meta Quest headset five days a week, for roughly 60 to 90 minutes at a time. She's not attending live concerts or watching immersive films. Dickson, a fitness buff since Jane Fonda workout videos in the '80s, largely uses her headset for one reason — to play Supernatural, a VR fitness game with a huge, loyal fan base and a tight-knit community.

Supernatural isn't dead, but it might as well be. A few weeks ago, Meta shut down three VR studios as part of broader layoffs in its Reality Labs division. As a result, Supernatural will no longer get new content. That's why Dickson is spearheading an online social media campaign to save Supernatural from slowly fading into oblivion.

Supernatural is a mix between a Peloton class and rhythm games like Just Dance or Beat Saber. You swat at targets as they fly toward you, timed to music, inside a picturesque virtual world. You can choose from a library of dance-like Flow workouts, boxing, or even meditative breathing classes. Like any connected fitness game, Supernatural's stickiness relies on an ever-evolving content library. New music, levels, and choreography keep people hooked because they not only keep things fresh, but strengthen the bond between users and the game's charismatic coaches.

“Mark Zuckerberg helped buy a ballroom for a fascist. Perhaps it is not surprising that he killed Supernatural.”

For a game like Supernatural, shutting down content production was a death knell that left Dickson and countless other Supernatural fans blindsided with shock, then grief. The Supernatural Facebook page has over 110,000 members, many of whom have written sprawling odes to the game. Over 7,000 and counting have also signed a Change.org petition, begging Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to rethink the decision.

Dickson is what your typical Supernatural user looks like. In an emerging tech category with expensive hardware dominated by 18-to-34-year-old men, the majority of Supernatural's warriors are women, people over 50, and folks with limited mobility. And in the weeks since the news, they're not staying quiet in their grief.

They're pissed, and they want Meta to know two things. Not only has the company royally screwed up, but they're also not letting Supernatural go without a fight.

“My opinion of Meta can be summed up as @*#&&1 $&#^!@ &^#%,” Regina Lynn, a Supernatural athlete in her 50s, tells me in an email. (Athlete is the term the Supernatural community prefers.) Lynn has been playing for five years, roughly three to four times a week. “Mark Zuckerberg helped buy a ballroom for a fascist. Perhaps it is not surprising that he killed Supernatural.”

Lynn is one of several Supernatural fans who reached out to The Verge to say they see a correlation between what's going on in the world and how Meta has conducted business since acquiring Within, the studio behind the game. Unlike Meta, Within was an independent studio with roots in music videos, feature films, and creative projects. In a Decoder interview, Within cofounder Chris Milk described building Supernatural as “making something that is meaningful to another human being” — something more akin to immersive art than a means to solidify dominance in the VR market. That, in no small part, explains why some fans have reacted so viscerally.

Supernatural was widely considered a successful VR app before Meta ever entered the picture. In fact, when Meta announced it planned to buy it in 2021, the Federal Trade Commission launched a probe to try and block the acquisition — partly because Meta had already acquired Beat Saber, a similar VR game, and Supernatural threatened its dominance. It was also reported that Meta was keen to snap up the game before Apple, which was rumored to be interested in the game. The FTC probe ultimately failed, and the acquisition was completed in 2023.

“This is just a small mirror of a huge problem in our society right now. The blunt way of saying it is those with the gold make the rules. This is what we're fighting on every single level globally right now,” says Dickson. “We're fighting those with the money telling us how our lives will be lived, what we can access, what we can do, and what we can say. … Of course there are far bigger things to fight for right now, and I do. But if I don't take care of my health, my mental health, my physical body? I have nothing to give or fight with for the big causes.”

“I despise Meta along with the oligarchs, the top one percent that continue to destroy our world and kill anything that brings joy and beauty of human experience and connection because their only goal is to make a profit.”

“I despise Meta along with the oligarchs, the top one percent that continue to destroy our world and kill anything that brings joy and beauty of human experience and connection because their only goal is to make a profit,” agrees DeeDee Henry, an avid Supernatural athlete since 2020. Henry, who has participated in beta testing and user interviews for the app, says she finds it “overwhelming” to convey how much Supernatural's community has impacted her.

“We have built a community of love and support with each other. We meet each other, we talk, and we form bonds.”

Behind the anger is a community's palpable loss over the fact that they may lose the very thing that brought them together. To its diehard fans, Supernatural was more than “just a game.” It was a virtual place to prioritize health while making friends. Take Henry and Dickson. A year ago, the two were complete strangers. They were randomly paired together through Supernatural's Together multiplayer feature, which enables joint workouts, supports voice chat, and allows players to create teams. A year later, Dickson and Henry have formed “Team Sunshine” with Henry's 75-year-old mother, Darlene “Cookie” Norman, and a fourth friend, Kelly Hines. The four women play five days a week but have yet to all meet in person, with Dickson living in Canada, Henry just outside Los Angeles, Norman in rural California, and Hines in Ohio.

And it's not just making friends. Marginalized users say Supernatural let them exercise without judgment. Inside the headset, they could lunge, squat, and swipe at targets just like anyone else. They didn't have to worry about being looked down on for not having six-pack abs, being older, working out in a wheelchair, or having a limited range of movement.

Peruse the Supernatural Facebook group, and you'll find hundreds of stories like this and more. More than 50 Supernatural athletes reached out to The Verge specifically to share how the game helped them through deep depression, bouts with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses, as well as rehabilitation from serious injuries. Some have lost a significant amount of weight, while others say it's the only form of accessible fitness that keeps them engaged.

“There was no intimidation of gym settings, no time required to drive there, no time limit on when or for how long I could jump in and sweat. Supernatural is the only reason I bought my Quest 2 headset and is the only cardio exercise I do,” says Vickie Bitter, another Supernatural athlete in her 50s. “It is literally the only thing I use on it every single day.”

“I can't move my ankle, I can't stand up on my toes or anything,” says Jennifer Boyer, a longtime Supernatural athlete who needs ankle-foot orthotics, a type of brace that goes from the bottom of the foot to the knee. For Boyer, maintaining core strength is a necessity while using the braces to prevent injury. Unfortunately, Boyer didn't like gyms because she felt self-conscious and found repetitive strength routines boring. As a result, she struggled to find a workout that would stick.

Supernatural appealed to Boyer because the choreography in the game's Flow workouts kept movements fresh. In these levels, different types of triangles fly toward users to signal whether they should squat or lean into side lunges. They're interspersed with teardrop-shaped balls pointed in different directions, signaling where they should swing their arms. Users with limb differences can also pick a wheelchair mode, choose single-handed play, or adjust settings to accommodate their mobility needs.

“I hurt so much after the first day because I wouldn't stop playing. It was so much fun. You're doing squats and side lunges — I can't do traditional lunges where you step forward and drop a knee to the ground. But with Supernatural, I love the Flow workouts because I feel more like I'm dancing,” Boyer explains.

“I introduce many of my patients to VR. I have a pretty high take rate, meaning that they like it and enjoy it as an intervention,” says Jeanna Duryee, a physical therapist. “In Alaska, I'm fighting depression, deconditioning, and seasonal [affective] disorder at a higher rate [than] in other areas. Supernatural gave me a tool to use to get people that I never seen smile, smile broadly while exercising. I see people that say they hate exercise and hate gyms, but they love Supernatural.”

The fervent devotion among Supernatural fans is reminiscent of another connected fitness platform: Peloton. Like Peloton users, Supernatural athletes have to invest in niche hardware. But a major difference is that Peloton is an independent company whose sole purpose is maintaining and improving on a single platform. Meta may have invested (and lost) billions in VR and the metaverse over the years, but it's notably shifted gears toward its AI. And where Peloton fans love the company, Supernatural fans strongly feel Meta fumbled a rising star.

Given the game's popularity and Meta's ambitions to dominate the VR market, one might think it'd be a no-brainer to invest in Supernatural. But according to Boyer, Dickson, and dozens of other Supernatural fans, the decline in quality was undeniable once Meta acquired Supernatural. Not just in terms of features, but also in community support.

“When Meta said they were going to buy it, everyone was like, ‘Oh my god, kiss of death.' It wasn't long after Meta bought it that they stopped having the extra features they said they would have,” says Boyer, a longtime Supernatural beta tester before and after Meta's acquisition.

“When Meta said they were going to buy it, everyone was like, ‘Oh my god, kiss of death.'”

Prior to the acquisition, Boyer says you could tune into video calls with Supernatural coaches. While athletes couldn't speak to them directly, they could type in the chat and receive personalized shoutouts and responses. After the acquisition, those opportunities slowed down. Instead of directly hopping into chats with coaches, fans were limited to seeing videos and hoping the algorithm would surface their comments on coaches' posts. Boyer asserts that compared to the original owners, Meta never took an interest in getting feedback on new features either.

“There was a new workout every day, and then they started doing new workouts once a week. Then they fired all the user experience people who were managing, pulling together those fun things with the coaches. Then there were no more beta group chats,” laments Boyer, noting that soon there were no new backdrops for the game.“Other app developers should take note of how capriciously Meta fought for, then ditched Supernatural. If you make something you love, you might make a pile of money selling it to Meta, but they're likely to mismanage and kill it,” adds Matt Krzycki, an early adopter of Supernatural.

But for many vocal Supernatural fans, the most painful part of Meta's neglect wasn't the slow decay of the platform or the lack of new content. The ultimate betrayal is how the company has treated the creative team behind the game, particularly the coaches. In nearly every interview, Supernatural fans told The Verge that the Supernatural coaches' openness and vulnerability helped make the platform stand out among the competition. For them, the coaches weren't people inside the headset. They were friends and family.

“It wasn't like when they cancel your favorite show, and you feel bad for everyone in the production and hope the actors get new roles. Instead, these were six people who I personally spent half an hour with almost every day for almost a year,” says Erica Carter, speaking of the Supernatural coaches. “So when they were laid off, when they posted videos trying to be strong and supportive, putting the community first — gosh, it hurts. I cried.”

The love for the coaches isn't hyperbole. When coach Leanne Pendante's husband died, the entire community rallied around her with an outpouring of love and support. Now that the community is suffering, the coaches are returning the favor.

“Yes, I did get laid off and it was very difficult because (a) I wasn't expecting it and (b) this Supernatural community, if you have not met them, they are incredible and they just swallow you with so much love and I just wanted to stay there forever,” coach Mindy Lai shared on Instagram.

“Apologies for not hopping on earlier in the week once all the news broke, but, you know, I got a family to provide for, so once everything happened I had to put my feet to the concrete and hit the streets and start making moves,” says coach Antonio “Doc” Harrison in an Instagram post. “I am so grateful, so honored and humbled to have been a small part of your journey.”

“There have been a couple of times where I'm like, ‘I want to get in! I just want to get in and do a workout, a group workout, let's see who's in there.' And it's hard,” coach Mark Harari says in a recently posted video, trying to motivate discouraged Supernatural users to put their headsets back on.

“We're still here, okay? We haven't left. All the coaches, we're still here. … We're still a part of this community, we're here still to love, and support, and to raise up, and to stand by your side when things are tough.”

When reached for comment, Meta declined to address the backlash it has since received from the community or plans for the future. Instead, spokesperson Johanna Peace pointed to several new features and content Meta released after the acquisition, including a price drop in the subscription, a multiplayer mode, and new artists series and collaborations.

But barring a reversal in its decision, there's little Meta can say to comfort Supernatural fans. Every single fan who spoke with The Verge has said their trust in the company has been shattered. For most, it's a matter of picking which is the lesser evil moving forward.

On Reddit and the Facebook group, some have already posted screenshots of canceling their subscriptions. Others, like Dickson, are trying to rally Supernatural fans to create a grassroots movement that could save the game. Of those who spoke to The Verge, everyone said they'd stick with Supernatural until they can't any longer. For most, the biggest source of anxiety is the music, as no one trusts Meta will renew licenses once they've run out. Once that happens, they fear workouts will begin disappearing, creating holes within the existing content library. Asked about alternatives, the most common response is, “There's nothing else like Supernatural out there.”

“I'm torn because I don't want to give Meta another penny. They don't deserve it,” says Boyer, who invested in three Meta Quest headsets, along with several straps and accessories. “The corporation as a whole does not care about the people who use it. That's the message I got from them and as a result, I will never buy those glasses, their watch, or any of the other things they're trying to develop.”

Pieter Montoulieu is taking a different approach. After five years of playing Supernatural, Montoulieu decided to channel his grief into creating a Supernatural-like prototype game for the Apple Vision Pro. Montoulieu says he's already been hit up by avid Supernatural fans interested in testing and creating custom workouts. Asked why the Vision Pro and not the Quest, Montoulieu says that “shutting down one of the only Meta services that actually made me feel healthier was kind of the last straw.”

For Dickson, the bare minimum that she wants from her campaign to save Supernatural is for the program to remain on Meta's servers with no disappearing songs or workouts.

“What I'd really like to see is an investor — someone of vision — to come along and possibly buy the rights of Supernatural and make it independent again,” says Dickson. Ideally, she says that'd mean rehiring the creative team, and not just the coaches and choreographers. “Maybe on a different platform that's supportive, like Steam. Where this program stays alive and continues to be guided by the Creative Vision of the people that made it in the first place.”

Through a spokesperson, Chris Milk declined to comment.

The mood in the Supernatural Facebook group is a picture in the five stages of grief. Right now, it's between denial and incandescent anger. Frustration with Meta (and colorful insults for Zuckerberg) sits directly alongside hope that this isn't truly the end. Supernatural coaches still pop in to post motivational videos, challenging users to venture back into their headsets and take heart in the community, existing content library, and their shared experiences.

“People are telling me I'm nuts and I'm going, ‘No, no. I will not give up.' It'll take the coaches reaching out to me to say, ‘We don't want you to do this, Sherry.' But they're not,” Dickson says.

For now, Dickson is hoping to stir up the community's fighting spirit. To get them believing that Meta can be shamed into doing the right thing and preserve the app. Or perhaps signal that a dedicated community is still there for potential buyers. After all, Dickson says, Disney reinstated Jimmy Kimmel after a week of public pressure — who's to say it's impossible?

It's possible Supernatural will miraculously get a second life. More likely, it'll end up as another casualty of Meta's shifting ambitions. But, among the hundreds of forum comments and over 50 interviews I've conducted, perhaps this sentiment from Supernatural fan Sherer Minor sums it up best.

“I hope the app, in whatever form I can get it, never truly goes away. In the meantime, I'll keep logging in and punching the air, because punching people is frowned upon.”

For decades, UFO sightings have hovered between belief and disbelief, fuelled by grainy footage and official silence. The debate was often dismissed as fringe, leaving the public with speculation rather than science.

Now, researchers say that era may finally be ending. A new push to detect and track Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAP, is promising something long missing from the debate: hard data.

Backed by cutting edge sensors, coordinated observers and public transparency, researchers say the so called 'UAP Trap' could finally prove what is really flying through Earth's airspace.

The renewed urgency comes as governments openly acknowledge that UAP are real but poorly understood. Military pilots have testified to Congress about objects that defy known technology, while defence agencies admit they often lose track of them the moment sensors lock on.

According to researchers involved in the UAP Detection and Tracking Summit, the problem has never been sightings. It has been verification. Without calibrated instruments and shared data, rumours fill the gaps. The summit brings together scientists, engineers and policy experts who argue that modern technology has finally caught up with the mystery.

High speed cameras, advanced radar, infrared imaging and acoustic sensors can now monitor the skies across multiple ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. When combined, these tools allow researchers to rule out aircraft, drones, weather events and sensor glitches. What remains, they say, is the real anomaly.

At the heart of the new approach is coordination. Instead of relying on a single camera or radar hit, teams are deploying networks of instruments that watch the same patch of sky at the same time.

Experts explain that one sensor alone can mislead. Radar can pick up distant aircraft. Infrared can be confused by heat reflections. Optical cameras can blur fast moving objects. But when all systems register the same event, the margin for error shrinks dramatically.

Some groups are already operating mobile labs fitted with night vision, thermal imaging and audio sensors that detect sounds beyond human hearing. Others are testing systems that capture thousands of frames per second, allowing scientists to study rapid acceleration and sudden direction changes in detail.

This layered detection model is what researchers call the 'UAP Trap'. It is designed to catch fleeting events that once slipped away unnoticed or unproven.

One striking feature of the new effort is how much it relies on civilians. Pilots, police officers and ordinary witnesses are often the first to spot unusual objects, yet their reports have historically gone nowhere.

Organisers of the summit argue that this must change. Law enforcement and aviation professionals are trained observers, and their testimony carries weight. New reporting networks aim to collect these accounts alongside sensor data, building a fuller picture of each event.

Veteran researchers involved in the project caution against promises of sudden disclosure. Many say they have heard such claims for decades. What is different now, they argue, is evidence that cannot be ignored.

Data driven analysis changes the conversation. When anomalies are recorded by multiple sensors, analysed frame by frame and published openly, denial becomes harder. Lawmakers are already pressing for limits on over classification, while scientists insist that transparency is essential for public trust.

The goal is not to jump to conclusions, but to replace speculation with measurement. Whether UAP turn out to be unknown technology, natural phenomena or something more extraordinary, researchers say the truth must be grounded in evidence.

With crowded skies, rising safety concerns and growing public curiosity, the push to understand UAP is no longer fringe. As the 'UAP Trap' comes online, scientists believe the world may finally get clear answers to a question that has lingered for generations.

Ryan Wedding has been arrested. But many of the biggest open questions in his case remain unanswered.

Ryan Wedding has been arrested. But many of the biggest open questions in his case remain unanswered.

Ryan Wedding, 44, has been arrested. But many of the biggest questions of his case remain unanswered.

SANTA ANA, Calif.—Ryan Wedding walked into a California courtroom with a sneer, eyeing investigators in the front row and a swarm of journalists packing the gallery.

Once a top FBI fugitive, Wedding finally faced a U.S. judge in federal court this week, where he pleaded not guilty to 17 felony charges — including murder, drug trafficking and other alleged crimes.

It was a pivotal moment in the years-long pursuit of a Canadian former Olympic snowboarder authorities have labelled one of the most violent criminals in the world, and the first step in what promises to be a sweeping prosecution involving dozens of co-defendants.

Mexican and American authorities had cast a wide dragnet to catch the fugitive, and now they have their target.

Still, many of the biggest mysteries in this unfolding crime story remain unanswered. Here's a closer look at the key open questions in the Ryan Wedding case:

Notorious fugitive Ryan Wedding was arrested in Mexico January 22, 2026

It's been over two years since Jagtar Singh Sidhu, 57, and Harbhajan Kaur Sidhu, 55, were killed in an attack allegedly orchestrated by Wedding.

The couple were gunned down at their kids' rental home in Caledon, Ont., on the night of Nov. 20, 2023. Their daughter, Jaspreet, was shot 13 times but survived.

Authorities later revealed the hit men were allegedly hired by Wedding to kill an Ontario trucker who stole a cocaine shipment from his organization — the killers had the wrong people. 

Since then, the question of how exactly the gunmen got it so wrong has been one of the central mysteries of the case.

The name of the intended target has never been reported; the Star is withholding details of his identity due to ongoing concerns for his safety. 

What is known is that the man worked for trucking companies in the Peel Region and has since been given some element of protection from local police, though the exact details of this are unknown.

It would be natural to assume the man may have previously rented the home where the attack occurred, but local police and American authorities have not confirmed this.

While some arrests have been made in other local shootings loosely linked to the case, police have yet to identify or lay charges against any gunmen in the Sidhus' murders.

“We sympathize with the Sidhu family, who continues to grieve their loved ones as they await answers,” OPP Det. Insp. Brian McDermott told the Star in a statement this week.

He said the probe remains active and ongoing. “We cannot speculate on whether developments in other regions, including arrests, may support the investigation but we remain committed to bringing answers to the family by identifying and arresting the individual(s) responsible for taking the lives of two innocent people,” McDermott said, urging anyone with information to contact police.

“Remember one thing,” her dad told her the morning of his murder. “The day your father will die, he'll tell himself, ‘I love my daughter the most 

“Remember one thing,” her dad told her the morning of his murder. “The day your father will die, he'll tell himself, ‘I love my daughter the most 

Wedding's capture has become a major diplomatic flashpoint between two governments. At issue: What exactly did U.S. agents do inside Mexico?

According to Mexican officials, Wedding voluntarily surrendered himself to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City.

If you ask American law enforcement leaders, and Wedding's lawyer, they'd tell you that's wrong; he was nabbed in what the FBI Director Kash Patel has called a “high-stakes” tactical operation by U.S. agents.

The problem is that from the Mexican perspective, the FBI isn't supposed to be operating on Mexican soil. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum has challenged Patel's description, saying her government would never allow a foreign power to execute such an operation.

Only adding to the confusion, Sheinbaum also publicly pointed to a faked Instagram photo as proof that Wedding had, indeed, surrendered. In the image, a man resembling the six-foot-four Canadian can be seen in front of a U.S. embassy building in the heart of Mexico City in the same outfit he'd later be seen wearing on his FBI perp walk — jeans, a long-sleeved shirt, a Moncler puffer vest and a cap with a distinctive “L.A.” design.

A fake Instagram account shows a man who looks like Ryan Wedding in front of a decommissioned U.S. Embassy building in Mexico City with a caption claiming he surrendered.

But the photo shows clear signs it was created artificially, including a distorted design on the cap and the fact that the actual embassy moved to a brand-new building in November. 

While the FBI has declined to share more details about the nature of his arrest, the Wall Street Journal has reported that Mexican security forces were closing in when they were joined by U.S. authorities who, following an intense negotiation, apprehended Wedding.

It remains unclear if we'll ever learn the truth.

If Wedding did surrender, it could signal he'd become more of a liability than an asset to the Mexican cartels. 

Authorities have nabbing the guys behind the drug distribution, his alleged money man, and even his so-called “cocaine lawyer.” They've also placed immense public pressure on the fugitive and his inner circle after adding him to the FBI's most wanted list and dangling an enormous $15-million reward.

That's a lot of heat; the cartel could have told Wedding, “Look, either give yourself up or, worse, we're not protecting you anymore,” said retired FBI agent Brett Kalina, who once arrested the Canadian on drug trafficking charges in California in 2008.

In a scenario in which Wedding has lost the favour of the Sinaloa Cartel — once run by Joaquín (El Chapo) Guzmán — a U.S. prison may be the only place he's safe from his former associates.

If Wedding is willing to co-operate, Kalina suggested he wouldn't necessarily turn on people in the cartels, but rather their partners around the world.

But that would be a dangerous choice, Kalina said — “He will not survive prison if he gives up the wrong people.”

The possibility that the Canadian co-operates “remains open,” said Martin Estrada, the former U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, who led the Wedding prosecution until he retired in January 2025. The Star interviewed Estrada this week at his Los Angeles law firm, where he now works as a trial attorney.

Striking a deal with any defendant “requires a measured, thoughtful approach and decision by the government,” Estrada said.

However, he added, some people simply should not be afforded the opportunity because their crimes are too severe. “They need to be held accountable.”

The Netflix pitch for the Ryan Wedding story couldn't be more straightforward: Olympic athlete turns Scarface.

But the known timeline of his rise to becoming an alleged international drug lord has some surprisingly large gaps.

The FBI first caught wind of Wedding in 2008, when he and a low-level drug dealer flew from Vancouver to California to purchase 24 kilograms of cocaine from an informant. Wedding was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and sentenced to four years in prison.

Not long after his release in December 2011, Wedding was back in Canada. By 2013, undercover agents with the RCMP had infiltrated his network. They'd spend the next two years uncovering various schemes by Wedding and his associates to allegedly buy and import tons of cocaine linked to Colombian and Mexican cartels into Canada.

Around then, court records obtained by the Star paint a picture of Wedding as a cartel middleman, allegedly co-ordinating drug shipments from the Caribbean with men tied to El Chapo. In 2015, the RCMP charged Wedding and more than a dozen others in the undercover sting dubbed Operation Harrington — but Wedding was never arrested.

A decade later, the U.S. indictments from 2024 and 2025 suggest Wedding spent the intervening time building up a billion-dollar-a-year organization. First, the drugs would be cooked and tested in “cocaine kitchens” run with the help of Colombian neo-paramilitary groups. Next, they'd ship the cocaine by boat and plane into Mexico, hundreds of kilos at a time. Then it was onto semi-trucks destined for California stash houses. And finally, it was loaded onto trucks driven by GTA truckers bound for Ontario.

The logistics of the case are impressive. Still, it's a huge leap to go from a mid-level cartel figure in the mid-2010s to an alleged top boss — and we don't know how he got there.

Wedding, left, in court with his defence attorney Anthony Colombo.

If you ask Patel, the FBI director, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, they'll tell you Wedding is the modern-day version of two of Latin America's most notorious drug lords, Sinaloa's El Chapo and Colombia's Pablo Escobar.

Those comparisons are clearly an exaggeration — but by how much? 

“I don't make comparisons like that,” Estrada said; he thinks each defendant should be looked at “based on their particular conduct.” With Wedding, it's “really, a tragic story,” he continued, “not just squandering his opportunities, but rejecting them, wholly to go in the opposite direction and really become a scourge on his own nation and other nations.”

But how bad, exactly? U.S. authorities have said that Wedding is behind “dozens” of murders, but the indictments link his organization only to five killings.

Comparisons to some of the most-notorious drug lords in the history of Latin America are, at best, an exaggeration.

Comparisons to some of the most-notorious drug lords in the history of Latin America are, at best, an exaggeration.

Wedding himself has been charged with three killings near Toronto, including the Sidhus', and the assassination of a federal witness in Colombia. His alleged second in command, Andrew Clark, is also charged in the Caledon killings and another murder in Niagara Falls.

Attorneys stick to what they can prove, Estrada notes.

“It would not shock me to see that there were other (murders), but when you're prosecuting cases on behalf of the United States government, it'd be very precise and stick to the facts,” the former prosecutor said.

The discrepancy boils down to the intersection of evidence and intelligence, said Calvin Chrustie, a former senior operations officer for transnational organized crime within the RCMP.

Investigators will have “significant” amounts of credible intelligence that may not be attached to any criminal proceeding due to a lack of substantive evidence that meets the threshold of usability, Chrustie said. As well, some evidence cannot be entered in court because “it's too sensitive.”

In short, we just don't yet know how close Wedding was to being what Bondi and Patel claim.

While he was on the run, Wedding was living a life of luxury — high-end clothing, motorcycles, cars and fancy artwork — under the protection of the Sinaloa cartel.

The FBI released photos of items believed to be owned by Ryan Wedding that were seized in December by Mexican law enforcement partners.

His exact whereabouts in Sinaloa have not been made public, but his address was listed as Los Mochis, a coastal city in the state's northwest, in a Mexican court filing last year. (The court records, first reported by local media, show Wedding tried to prevent law enforcement from executing a warrant for his arrest and extradition in mid-February 2025 — just weeks after the assassination of the federal witness.)

That life is over now, but his network hasn't yet been fully dismantled.

Fewer than 10 Mercedes CLK-GTR roadsters were ever made, with the example seized by the FBI worth an estimated $13 million (U.S.).

Authorities are still looking for multiple associates, including the suspects who killed the witness, Jonathan Acebedo Garcia, at a restaurant in Medellín, Colombia, on Jan. 31, 2025.

The victim, a Montrealer who met Wedding in prison before working with him, was set to testify at trial.

And while Wedding's days on the run are over, it remains to be seen what will happen in court — and how, or if, the death of Acebedo Garcia hurts the prosecution.

As for the outstanding Canadian charges from the mid-2010s, the RCMP could, technically, seek Wedding's extradition. But the chances of him facing trial on those offences are incredibly small if he is convicted in the U.S.

WATCH: 'There is always UFO hotspots!' Historian sheds light on whether aliens have visited earth

The President has previously teased that he has heard 'very interesting things' about the possibility of alien life

A British filmmaker has claimed that President Donald Trump is preparing to deliver a major speech on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that could dramatically alter humanity's understanding of extraterrestrial life.

Mark Christopher Lee, a UK-based writer, director and ufologist, told the Daily Mail he had been informed by a Trump administration adviser that the President “has been given authority by the other major world leaders to make this announcement".

Mr Lee claimed the address was initially scheduled for the United Nations General Assembly in September but has reportedly been moved forward to July 8 - the 79th anniversary of the Roswell incident.“New intelligence developments have made it a matter of urgency,” he told the Daily Mail, adding that Mr Trump's tendency to act unpredictably meant the announcement could come even sooner.According to Mr Lee, the speech will confirm that forensic analysis of recovered craft and non-human biological material has verified their extraterrestrial origin - a first for any sitting world leader.The address is expected to reference several high-profile cases that have fuelled speculation for decades, including the 2004 USS Nimitz encounter with a Tic Tac-shaped object, the GoFast and Gimbal incidents recorded by USS Roosevelt personnel in 2015, and the alleged Roswell crash of 1947.Mr Lee claimed the President would also announce new declassification measures, the creation of an interagency scientific task force, and expanded cooperation with allied nations.Several of the incidents cited have previously been examined by Congress.Mr Lee said the President's tendency to act unpredictably meant the announcement could come even sooner | GETTYFormer Navy fighter pilot David Fravor testified that he encountered a wingless, windowless white object around 40 feet long during a training mission near San Diego in November 2004, saying it mirrored his aircraft before accelerating away at extreme speed.Another former Navy pilot, Ryan Graves, told lawmakers that the GoFast and Gimbal encounters raised serious flight safety and national security concerns, with crews repeatedly observing objects that appeared stationary in strong winds or travelling at hypersonic speeds.However, US officials have offered alternative explanations.Dr Jon Kosloski, head of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, told Congress in 2024 that the infrared footage was “a trick of the eye”, attributing it to an optical effect known as parallax.

Retired US Air Force Major David Grusch, now an adviser to Congress's UAP Task Force, claimed last month that Mr Trump has been briefed on crashed spacecraft, recovered non-human remains and intelligence concerning their origins.

Mr Grusch said the President could become “the most consequential leader in world history” if he were to make such a disclosure.

The whistleblower has claimed he reviewed intelligence files and photographs depicting non-human bodies, and has alleged that Mr Trump was informed during his first term of multiple alien species - including one said to be crossbreeding with humans.

Previous US administrations, the Pentagon and Nasa have repeatedly denied recovering extra-terrestrial technology or having contact with alien life, and no physical evidence supporting such claims has ever been released publicly.

The claims were echoed in August 2025 by Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a close Trump ally, who told the same podcast that the US government possesses evidence of “interdimensional beings”.

Former Navy fighter pilot David Fravor testified that he encountered a wingless, windowless white object around 40 feet long during a training mission near San Diego in November 2004, saying it mirrored his aircraft before accelerating away at extreme speed.

Another former Navy pilot, Ryan Graves, told lawmakers that the GoFast and Gimbal encounters raised serious flight safety and national security concerns, with crews repeatedly observing objects that appeared stationary in strong winds or travelling at hypersonic speeds.

However, US officials have offered alternative explanations.

Dr Jon Kosloski, head of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, told Congress in 2024 that the infrared footage was “a trick of the eye”, attributing it to an optical effect known as parallax.

US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE

Retired US Air Force Major David Grusch, now an adviser to Congress's UAP Task Force, claimed last month that Mr Trump has been briefed on crashed spacecraft, recovered non-human remains and intelligence concerning their origins.

Mr Grusch said the President could become “the most consequential leader in world history” if he were to make such a disclosure.

The whistleblower has claimed he reviewed intelligence files and photographs depicting non-human bodies, and has alleged that Mr Trump was informed during his first term of multiple alien species - including one said to be crossbreeding with humans.

Previous US administrations, the Pentagon and Nasa have repeatedly denied recovering extra-terrestrial technology or having contact with alien life, and no physical evidence supporting such claims has ever been released publicly.

 Mr Trump has previously hinted that he possesses deeper knowledge about UFOs and the possible existence of alien life.

During his first term, he told his son Don Trump Jr in an interview that he had heard “very interesting things” about the Roswell incident, but declined to elaborate.

In the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, Mr Trump appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience, where he confirmed he had spoken with US pilots who claimed to have seen fast-moving “round objects” in the sky.

The claims were echoed in August 2025 by Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a close Trump ally, who told the same podcast that the US government possesses evidence of “interdimensional beings”.
