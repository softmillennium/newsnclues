                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin dropped below $75,000 on Sunday, the latest in a series of slides that have dragged down the original cryptocurrency since last autumn. While Bitcoin posed a modest rally on Monday, climbing back towards $80,000 by mid-afternoon, that's still a 37% dip from its record high in October, according to Binance. Crypto's downturn is in part spurred by recent macroeconomic factors. One analyst attributes it to soft earnings reports in the tech sector, gold and silver declining, and the nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve chair. “Bitcoin's breakdown stems from a confluence of three factors that took markets days to digest: disappointing Magnificent 7 earnings that cracked the AI narrative, a violent precious metals unwind, and uncertainty around Kevin Warsh's Fed Chair nomination,” said Jasper de Maere, a desk strategist at Wintermute. The stalling of a major crypto bill is also on investors' minds as they pull back. The Clarity Act was supposed to establish market structure rules for crypto trading but has stumbled in its path to a presidential signature. In January, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong pulled his support of the bill because it prohibited customers from earning yield on stablecoins. As investors steer clear of the dollar, precious metals have also seen volatile price swings. The crypto world is no stranger to down cycles. There is no major scandal that sparked the decline this time around. Instead, investors are shying away from risky assets during uncertain times. “Crypto's been in a bear market longer than most appreciate, but this is organic deleveraging rather than structural crisis,” de Maere added.

Bitcoin has fallen to its lowest level since before the 2024 election. The token is deep in a bear market, down as much as 37% from its October peak, briefly dropping below $75,000 on Monday before edging back up to around $78,500. The brutal sell-off that tanked metals prices spilled over into bitcoin, analysts say. Every time William publishes a story, you'll get an alert straight to your inbox!

The breakdown in their price on Friday was the latest factor to weigh on crypto, but disappointments had been mounting for bitcoin investors for months. But the enthusiasm has since waned and the regulatory bonanza seems to have been fully digested by markets while other more bearish factors have played into its price. For one, speed bumps like trade wars, a sluggish labor market, and government shutdowns, investors have been wary of riskier assets. Bitcoin and other risk assets like growth stocks tend to thrive in low-rate, easy-money environments. That's according to Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com. He added: "Every bubble needs a pin to pop it and the nomination of Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair was the prick this time."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is considering the issuance of a wholesale CBDC (wCBDC) to support the settlement of tokenized government bonds. The country's Bureau of the Treasury first issued tokenized treasury bonds to institutions in 2023, followed by a retail issuance in 2024. Separately, in 2024 the central bank ran wCBDC trials, Project Agila,  to explore the usage of the CBDC for interbank settlement outside of working hours. “What we are thinking of doing next is to focus on wholesale CBDC settling government bonds, because the Bureau of the Treasury moved ahead with their pilot of the tokenized treasury bonds. It just lacked a settlement instrument, so we will be providing that with CBDC,” said BSP Deputy Governor Mamerto Tangonan, according to local media outlet GMA News. Building on the initial Project Agila trials which involved six banks, that is expected to expand for the second trial, with no target date specified. BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr. previously said he intended to launch a wCBDC significantly before his term expires in 2029, but the central bank has no plans for a retail CBDC. Want the full story?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At $78,700, BTC is higher by 2% over the past 24 hours and up 7% from its weakest price of the weekend, but still down more than 10% on a week-over-week basis. Ether ETH$2,344.19 is also up about 2% over the past day, but down 19% from week-ago levels. Crypto's weekend move "broke key short-term support and stood out for its speed and depth, even by typical weekend standards,” said Adrian Fritz, chief investment strategist at 21shares. According to Fritz, the sell-off was triggered by another round of forced deleveraging, as over $2 billion in crypto derivatives were liquidated in a rapid burst. "Liquidations in perps accelerated the downside momentum, rather than discretionary spot selling,” he said. U.S. stocks traded higher on Monday, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each ahead 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher by 0.9%. While bitcoin in January closed out its fourth-consecutive month of losses, expert tradfi market analyst Ryan Detrick noted the DJIA was higher for a ninth-straight month in January. That ranks among the Dow's longest ever winning streaks, said Detrick, who reminded that future returns for stocks tend to be strong after such runs. Gold and silver are having a volatile day, but are currently down modestly after their worst one-day sell-off since 1980 on Friday. Looking ahead, investors will be awaiting this Friday's January U.S. jobs report for clues about whether the Federal Reserve might cut rates again after pausing rate cuts at its January meeting last week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How Epstein tried to buy his way Into Bitcoin's inner circle? Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the Department of Justice (DOJ) published a staggering 3.5 million pages of records, providing a sneak peek into how Jeffrey Epstein maintained a shadow network of influence long after his 2008 conviction. Deep within the DOJ dump, specifically in “Data Set 9”, investigators found a series of emails from October 2016. In these messages, Epstein pitched a financial project to Saudi Arabian royals and high-level financiers. The proposal was of a physical currency stamped with “In God We Trust,” mimicking the U.S. Dollar but tailored to Islamic religious sensibilities. Epstein suggested a digital version of this currency powered by blockchain, claiming he was in direct contact with the “founders of Bitcoin” who were very excited about the project. For years, crypto enthusiasts have argued that Bitcoin [BTC] may have been created by a group rather than a single individual. Although Epstein's emails offer no definitive proof, they show that he actively tried to position himself as a gatekeeper to the anonymous creators of the world's largest cryptocurrency. Beyond the sensational emails, the files also reveal how Epstein sought to exert influence in more concrete ways. While Epstein never controlled Bitcoin's decentralized code, the records make that clear. They also show that he operated within institutional circles where key discussions about the technology's future were taking place. The 2026 DOJ release highlights Epstein's exaggerated sense of influence rather than any genuine flaw in blockchain technology. Needless to say, Bitcoin operates as an open-source system wherein thousands of independent developers actively review and maintain it. This structure prevents any single donor, regardless of wealth or notoriety, from secretly altering the code or installing a backdoor.

Based on data from November 30, the firm had acquired its first 3.7 million ETH for approximately $14.95 billion and an average cost of around $4,001 per ETH. That same amount of ETH is now worth just $8.8 billion. Additionally, the firm has garnered approximately $400 million in unrealized losses from its purchases since that time, based on estimations made by Decrypt using the price of ETH at the time that each of its additional purchases was announced. “Ethereum on-chain activity and fundamentals have grown solidly in the past few months, but ETH prices have declined,” said BitMine chairman Tom Lee in a statement. “During the crypto winter of 2021-2022 or 2018-2019, Ethereum transaction activity and active wallets declined, which is counter to what we have seen in the past 12 months.” Last week, gold made a new all-time high above $5,600 an ounce and silver surged above $150, before both began a slide back to recent prices of $4,680 and $75.69, respectively.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitmine's Tom Lee is facing mounting criticism after Ethereum's price fell below $2,200 this week, sharply underperforming his high-profile forecast that it could reach between $7,000 and $9,000 by the end of January. Now into February, Ethereum has lost more  than 52% from its recent highs, while Bitcoin has retreated to below $77,824, far short of Lee's call for $180,000. The shortfall has triggered intense backlash on social media, where investors questioned Lee's credibility and accused him of fueling unrealistic expectations in an already volatile market.

Lee's aggressive forecasts have made him a target on X, where critics grouped him into what one trader called the “prediction industrial complex.” “Called for $180,000 BTC and $7,000–$9,000 ETH by end of January,” the post read. Stop putting him in front of consumers,” while a separate comment said Lee's “biggest mistake was getting into the short-term prediction game,” adding that it “makes him look bad.” After this, I don't want to hear another “expert prediction” from these paid voices. Lee, who chairs BitMine Immersion Technologies, has frequently defended his long-term outlook. While Lee's supporters note that some of his long-term directional calls — particularly on Bitcoin — were eventually validated when the cryptocurrency reached record highs in October 2025, critics say his forecasts have consistently missed. Appearing on CNBC's Squawk Box  on Monday, Tom Lee acknowledged the recent sell-off but said prices were diverging from underlying network activity. In a subsequent post on X , Lee said crypto prices had “fallen sharply in 2026 and languished after Oct. 10,” despite what he described as strong fundamentals, including rising daily transaction volumes. He contrasted the current downturn with past crypto winters, arguing that network usage remains robust even as prices lag. Crypto prices have fallen sharply in 2026 and languished after Oct 10th. – fundamentals have been good as daily transactions are surging – but prices lagging, – a contrast to past crypto “winters” 🥶🌨️ Great speaking with @JoeSquawk  @BeckyQuick  @andrewrsorkin  on @SquawkCNBC … https://t.co/PME3sgaAni  pic.twitter.com/CSyj1q4iEP That position, he argued, allows the firm to withstand prolonged weakness in Ethereum's price. After Lee argued  that rising gold prices were bullish for Bitcoin, Schiff pushed back, saying the two assets historically competed rather than moved in tandem. Schiff has regularly aimed his criticism at media outlets and commentators he claims have failed to challenge bullish narratives around crypto. He alleged that CNBC interviewers routinely avoid tough questions and overlook the accuracy of previous predictions. “CNBC will continue to host Bitcoin shills for softball interviews where they refuse to hold their guests accountable for their horribly wrong Bitcoin forecasts,” he wrote on X.</p>

It's all part of newly appointed CEO Marcus Lemonis' vision to build an integrated home ecosystem that — in addition to supplying homeowners with the products they need through its retail banners, Bed Bath & Beyond, Overstock and BuyBuy Baby — also helps homeowners finance, protect and care for their home. “People understand the ‘Bed,' they understand the ‘Bath,' but even in pop culture, yes, even in movies and television, few could explain the ‘Beyond' part of our name,” said Lemonis in a statement announcing his appointment as CEO. Bed Bath & Beyond already has been actively building out a blockchain asset portfolio, beginning with the April 2025 offering of digital tokens that allowed investors to own a piece of the IP and performance of the Overstock and BuyBuy Baby brands. Upon launching its new franchising model for Bed Bath & Beyond stores, BB&B Inc. also announced that franchisees would have access to digital tokenization capabilities to democratize ownership of their stores and raise capitalthrough the tZero platform, in which BB&B is an investor through its Medici portfolio. TZero also will play a key role in the Tokens.com platform, which Bed Bath & Beyond expects to be operational by July 1, 2026. The platform will aim to address what Bed Bath & Beyond described as a “fragmented market for financial services” by delivering a one-stop journey for real estate and other real-world asset finance that bridges both tokenized and traditional investing. The idea is to give customers a clear, consolidated view of their assets and interests — including ownership structure, estimated value ranges, existing obligations and available liquidity options — so that homeowners can easily understand what they own as well as the regulated pathways available to them to access or deploy that value. Tokens.com will be fully owned by Bed Bath & Beyond and as such will be integrated with the company's other financial technology, insurance and blockchain-based businesses. Tokens.com also will integrate with a series of financial partners, including Figure Technologies and Figure Markets, to access mortgages, home equity lines of credit, renovation loans, home makeover loans and other asset-backed lending and capital solutions. “With Figure's market-leading tokenization technology and platform, Tokens.com can help unlock the trillions of U.S. home equity and crypto assets, bringing consumers liquidity and spending power,” said Michael Tannenbaum, CEO of Figure Technology Solutions in a statement. “Placing an asset or security on blockchain technology does not change its legal or economic nature,” explained BB&B in its acquisition announcement. Tokenization is treated as infrastructure, not a new asset class.” For customers who access liquidity through the platform, Tokens.com is expected to provide flexibility in how funds can be delivered and how investing and other financing needs can be addressed through a true multi-asset ecosystem that will utilize both cash and cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins such as YLDS, the yield-bearing stablecoin offered by Figure. Tokens.com also will be designed with an embedded AI layer developed by ShyftLabs that will support asset analysis, eligibility assessment and certain decision orchestration actions across the platform, in order to “support informed decision-making while keeping all execution, approvals and transactions within regulated frameworks and partner systems.” Get access to exclusive content including newsletters, reports, research, videos, podcasts, and much more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York's top prosecutors are raising an alarm on the crypto industry's first legislative milestone, the GENIUS Act, alleging that the law fails to protect victims of fraud and gives legal cover to companies that are “profiting from fraud.” In a letter exclusively seen by CNN and signed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and four district attorneys, including Manhattan's Alvin Bragg, the prosecutors say the law has provided the “imprimatur of legitimacy” for a kind of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, while allowing firms that issue stablecoins to “avoid significant regulatory requirements that are needed to combat financing terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, and especially cryptocurrency fraud.” The GENIUS Act is a broad bipartisan effort, signed into law in July, to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency that has exploded in popularity in the largely unregulated market for digital assets. The law creates reserve requirements for coin issuers similar to rules that ensure banks hold enough assets to cover their liabilities — meaning firms that issue stablecoins must back their digital offerings one-for-one with liquid assets like US dollars or short-term Treasuries. Trump is primed to cash in on the crypto gold rush he's helping create But James and Bragg take issue with what the GENIUS Act lacks — namely, language that would compel companies to return stolen funds to victims of fraud. That absence, they write, “will embolden stablecoin issuers, and even provide legal cover, when they affirmatively decide to keep stolen funds and proceeds under their control rather than returning them to victims.” Already, they claim, the two most dominant stablecoin issuers — Tether and Circle —  have throttled law enforcement efforts to seize and return funds to victims while profiting off the crimes that the prosecutors say remain prominent in stablecoin markets. But they say that it has only done so on an ad-hoc basis, and only when working with federal-level law enforcement. “The reality for many victims, therefore, is that funds stolen in or converted to USDT will never be frozen, seized, or returned,” the letter states. “They currently decide on a case-by-case basis when they will assist law enforcement in recovering funds for victims, and nothing prevents them from stopping all reissuance entirely.” Tether said in a statement to CNN that the company “takes fraud, consumer harm, and the misuse of USDT extremely seriously and maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward illicit activity.” The company, which is based in El Salvador, said that it “does not have a blanket legal obligation to comply with state-level civil or criminal processes in the way a US-regulated financial institution would. Prosecutors allege that Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer, which is publicly traded and headquartered in New York, “claims to be an ally in the fight against financial fraud.” But its policies “are significantly worse than those of Tether for victims of fraud,” the letter states. That creates a “crystal clear” financial incentive to reject requests from law enforcement, the prosecutors say. In a statement to CNN, Dante Disparte, Circle's chief strategy officer said the company “has always prioritized financial integrity and advancing US and global regulatory standards for stablecoins.” The GENIUS Act, Disparte said, “makes clear that stablecoin issuers must abide by applicable financial integrity rules for combating illicit activity, while enhancing clear consumer protection norms. While the bill received broad bipartisan support, critics have said it lacks sufficient protections for consumers and raises serious concerns about crypto volatility spilling into the mainstream financial system. And it comes as another landmark, industry-backed crypto regulation effort works its way through Congress. Schumer and Gillibrand didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Stablecoins, as their name suggests, are designed to hold a steady value by mirroring another asset, usually US dollars. One stablecoin should always equal roughly one dollar — a useful function for investors who want to keep their money within the crypto ecosystem without exposing their holdings to the wild swings that bitcoin, ether and other tokens are known for. They're also seen as a kind of on- and off-ramp between crypto and mainstream financial markets that have historically had little overlap. Everything to know about the crypto being debated in Congress While bitcoin remains the most popular crypto token, its trading volume is eclipsed by dollar-pegged stablecoins. That relative stability, combined with the anonymity of crypto transactions, has also proven popular among criminals. And while the crypto industry has been trying to shed its longtime association with scams, cybercrime, drug trafficking and money laundering, the crime problem is far from resolved. Since 2020, Chainalysis estimates illicit activity on the blockchain — crypto's core infrastructure — has grown by an average of 25% a year. Instead, they argue, “Tether has provided assistance only in limited circumstances, and Circle has chosen to actively thwart law enforcement and to profit from victims' losses.” The prosecutors estimate that in 2024 Circle and Tether each made $1 billion in profits from investing their reserve funds, including reserve funds backing stolen and frozen stablecoins. As of November, they say, Circle had more than $114 million in frozen funds. For crypto critics, the GENIUS Act's lack of fraud and restitution provisions point to an ongoing problem for the industry, where even basic consumer protections are missing. “All of that mundane stuff that has sort of been sorted out for traditional finance through decades of trial and error – it's not there in the GENIUS Act,” Hilary J. Allen, a law professor at American University who specializes in banking and cryptocurrency, told CNN.

("Bitmine" or the "Company") a Bitcoin and Ethereum Network company with a focus on the accumulation of crypto for long term investment, today announced Bitmine crypto + total cash + "moonshots" holdings totaling $10.7 billion. As of February 1st, 2026 at 6:00pm ET, the Company's crypto holdings are comprised of 4,285,125 ETH at $2,317 per ETH (Coinbase), 193 Bitcoin (BTC), $200 million stake in Beast Industries, $20 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) ("moonshots") and total cash of $586 million. "ETH prices have dropped sharply in the past month from ~$3,000 to ~$2,300. This occurred while Ethereum daily transactions hit an all-time high (ATH) of 2.5mm (per theblock.co) and active addresses soared in 2026 to an ATH to 1 million daily (per theblock.co). During the crypto winter of 2021-2022 or 2018-2019, Ethereum transaction activity and active wallets declined, which is counter to what we have seen in the past 12 months," said Thomas "Tom" Lee, Executive Chairman of Bitmine. Foremost, in our view, is that leverage has not returned yet to crypto as the October 10th ripple effects continue. On January 30, 2026, Gold fell -9%, its 4th largest ever daily decline. Each of the prior 3 larger declines marked a near-term top," said Lee. "Bitmine has staked more ETH than other entities in the world. At scale (when Bitmine's ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking rewards is $374 million annually (using 2.81% CESR), or greater than $1 million per day," stated Lee. "Annualized staking revenues are now $188 million, up +18% in the past week (see chart). The CESR (Composite Ethereum Staking Rate, administered by Quatrefoil) is 2.81%. We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America VAlidator Network (MAVAN). Bitmine is currently working with 3 staking providers as the Company moves towards unveiling MAVAN in 2026," continued Lee. According to data from Fundstrat, the stock has traded average daily dollar volume of $1.1 billion (5-day average, as of January 30, 2026), ranking #105 in the US, behind Schlumberger NV (rank #104) and ahead of Humana (rank #106) among 5,704 US-listed stocks (statista.com and Fundstrat research).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barry Silbert, CEO of cryptocurrency conglomerate Digital Currency Group, described the latest cryptocurrency crash as a god-sent opportunity poised to trigger significant capital inflows back into the sector. In an X post, Silbert referred to the market slump as a “gift from the crypto gods,” suggesting that it is clearing out excess leverage and “crap tokens.” “A massive capital rotation into crypto is about to begin. Time to pick your fighter,” the cryptocurrency mogul projected. Silbert's forecast follows a sharp market drop over the weekend, pushing Bitcoin and Ethereum to their lowest levels in months. Bitcoin, for instance, sank below $75,000, hitting levels last seen in April. Nearly $800 million was liquidated from the market in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass, with $600 million in levered longs wiped out. Notably, Michael Saylor, who spearheads Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR), hinted the company would buy the latest dip and add to its Bitcoin position. Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $76,926.08, down 2.15% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Investors like Cathie Wood were hopeful of a recovery, citing historical patterns where gold has preceded Bitcoin's bull markets. However, widely followed cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen argued that Bitcoin's rally peaked in October and has been in a bear market since.</p>

A proper ICO does not expose developers to technical risks, fraud while providing security in the crypto space. Partnering with an ICO Development Company gives businesses security, regulation, and a scalable platform to attract serious investors. As the ICO landscape matures, security becomes a basic requirement for project success. Security around ICO development is essential to ensure that token transactions, investor data, and smart contracts are secure, and to prevent reputational damage. Experienced ICO Development Companies implement several layers of security at all stages of the development process, ensuring that a stable infrastructure is in place and that there is constant monitoring. Trust is built over time by transparency, reliability and security. In the world of cryptocurrency, where scams and technical problems have proved fatal for many projects, security remains an important factor of legitimacy for the digital currency. An experienced ICO Development Company proves that it is reliable by verifying smart contracts and safeguarding funds and being ready for legal compliance on time, which persuades investors to fund an ICO. Security not only protects assets but also plays a crucial role in expanding investor participation. A well-protected ICO platform attracts global investors who prioritize safety and reliability. An ICO Development Company that emphasizes security-driven user experience helps businesses reach broader audiences while maintaining trust standards. Smart contracts ease fundraising, token issuance, and disbursements to investors. Their vulnerabilities can lead to investor losses and financial failure of the tokens' associated projects. Security and compliance are also closely linked for keeping ICO projects sustainable. An experienced ICO Development Company, with compliance tools like identity verification, secure data storage, and transaction transparency, keeps your project aligned with global standards. Security is important beyond the ICO itself: well-secured projects are less likely to have issues and can better function in the long term, and tokens are held by people on trusted platforms. Trustworthy and credible ICO development requires effective communication with investors. An ICO Development Company offers protection, scalability, and regulatory compliance to your network. When investors feel confident that the platform is safe and transparent, they are more likely to participate, allowing the project to reach its funding goals sooner, and providing tokens with sustainable value.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin price dropped to $75,000 while the market capitalization of all coins dropped by 4.4% in the last 24 hours to $2.55 trillion. Most altcoins were in the red, with the top laggards being tokens like River, Monero, Ethereum, Nexo, Chainlink, and Kaspa. Ethereum dropped by 10% in the last 24 hours, moving to a low of $2,200. Crypto market crashed as Fear and Greed Index fell For example, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs shed assets in January, continuing a trend that has been going on for months. Falling open interest is a sign that investors are not using as much leverage as they did in the past. At the same time, the elevated liquidations are happening as exchanges shut leveraged trades after hitting their margin levels. There are two broad reasons why the crypto crash is happening this year. For example, Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh to become the next Federal Reserve Chair. Historically, Warsh has always been a hawk who has opposed quantitative easing and criticized the Fed for cutting interest rates too early. Therefore, while Trump promised a Fed Chair who would cut interest rates to 1, chances are that Warsh will not do that. Risk of a war in the Middle East Iranian leaders warned that there will be a regional war if the United States attacked, which explains why Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) have retreated. He is also under pressure from hawks like Lindsey Graham, Mike Pompeo, and Mark Levin, whom he watches all the time on Fox News. These neocons have convinced Trump that the only way to deal with Iran is to topple the regime. Therefore, the crypto market crash happened because Bitcoin and other altcoins are not safe havens. Such a move will point to more downside in the crypto market. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.
