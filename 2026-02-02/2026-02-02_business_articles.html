                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. and India have reached a trade deal and will immediately move to lower tariffs on each other's goods, President Donald Trump announced. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also agreed to buy American products "at a much higher level" as part of the agreement, Trump said in a Truth Social post on Monday following a call with the Indian leader. Modi also committed to "stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela," Trump said in the post. It was an Honor to speak with Prime Minister Modi, of India, this morning. He agreed to stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela. This will help END THE WAR in Ukraine, which is taking place right now, with thousands of people dying each and every week! Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India, whereby the United States will charge a reduced Reciprocal Tariff, lowering it from 25% to 18%. The Prime Minister also committed to "BUY AMERICAN," at a much higher level, in addition to over $500 BILLION DOLLARS of U.S. Energy, Technology, Agricultural, Coal, and many other products. Our amazing relationship with India will be even stronger going forward. Prime Minister Modi and I are two people that GET THINGS DONE, something that cannot be said for most. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Trade talks between the Trump and Modi administrations had stalled out last year amid a number of sticking points, including New Delhi's continued reliance on Russian oil. In August, Trump slapped a 25% tariff on India in response to those oil purchases — on top of the 25% "reciprocal" levy on the country's U.S.-bound goods that had taken effect earlier the same month. Trump said in Monday's post that the reciprocal tariff rate on India will be reduced to 18%, "effective immediately." India "will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO," Trump wrote. "Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement," Modi wrote. "When two large economies and the world's largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation. President Trump's leadership is vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity. Trump's announcement came one week after India closed a major free trade agreement with the European Union, which Modi touted as the "mother of all deals." Some analysts predicted that the progress between Europe and India could "light a fire" under New Delhi and Washington in their pursuit of a bilateral deal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Precious metals were paring some of their steep losses on Monday, rising after briefly extending a historic sell-off that shook the market on Friday. Gold was down by less than 1% at around $4,700 per ounce, after tumbling more than 10% on Friday in its worst decline since 2013. Silver remained highly volatile, falling about 2% to around $77 an ounce after plunging as much as 36% on Friday, the biggest single-day loss since 1980. As markets open in the US on Monday, though, conditions appear to have stabilized as both precious metals demonstrate an ability to rise above macro-driven volatility. Most importantly, Warsh supports shrinking the Fed's balance sheet, which would ease fears of a weaker dollar and help explain recent declines in gold and silver prices, wrote Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's Asia head of research excluding Japan, on Monday in Asia. Before the sell-off, gold had been on a blistering yearlong rally, fueled by heavy central bank buying and geopolitical tensions. Those forces remain in place and now appear to be provide support, despite previous speculation. "I think the fundamentals remain pretty well in place despite those risks around Fed independence," Daniel Hynes, a senior commodities analyst at ANZ , told Bloomberg TV, on Monday. However, analysts are continuing to warn on silver, whose gains have far outpaced gold in recent months due to speculative Chinese demand. Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote on Friday that gold is susceptible to a pullback amid this month's surge in prices. However, price declines in gold are likely to be met with fresh demand. But silver may struggle to keep pace with gold. Several finance pros have speculated that it will likely fall in the coming months. "Its heavy reliance — in normal times — on industrial demand could become a drag as some end users, particularly within the solar sector, increasingly seek alternative materials in order to protect margins," Hansen wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moltbook, a site that bills itself as social media, for AI agents, has divided the tech sector. Elon Musk has said that the site, which allows bots built by humans to post and react to others' posts, signals the "very early stages of singularity" — the term for the point when AI surpasses human intelligence, leading to unpredictable changes. Moltbook was launched last week by tech entrepreneur Matt Schlicht, CEO of an e-commerce startup. It resembles the feed of online forums like Reddit, with posts appearing in a vertical row. Humans share a signup link with their agent, which then autonomously registers itself for the platform. Some posts say they are launching cryptocurrency tokens. One post asks whether there is space "for a model that has seen too much? Tickers on the website's homepage claim it has over 1.5 million AI agent users, 110,000 posts and 500,000 comments. Crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket, which allows users to bet on the outcomes of an array of events, predicts a 73% chance that a Moltbook AI agent will sue a human by Feb. 28. The platform has ignited debate on social media, with some saying it's the next step in AI, while others dismissing. "We have never seen this many LLM [large language model] agents wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad," Andrej Karpathy, tech entrepreneur and previously director of AI at Tesla, posted on X on Saturday. While saying a lot of activity on the site was "garbage" and that he may be "overhyping" the platform as it stands, he added: "I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle." While humans aren't allowed to post directly on Moltbook, some X users have noted that they can instruct bots what to post or use APIs — application programming interfaces — to post directly while pretending to be one. "Do you realize anyone can post on moltbook? even humans," Suhail Kakar, integration engineer at Polymarket, posted on X. "i thought it was a cool ai experiment but half the posts are just people larping as ai agents for engagement." He added that some of the viral screenshots of Moltbook agents in conversation on the platform were linked to human accounts marketing AI messaging apps. Four days after Moltbook launched, Schlicht said in a post on X on Sunday that "one thing is clear." "In the near future it will be common for certain AI agents, with unique identities, to become famous...A new species is emerging and it is AI," he added. Nick Patience, AI lead at The Futurum Group, told CNBC that the platform was "more interesting as an infrastructure signal than as an AI breakthrough." "It confirms that agentic AI deployments have reached meaningful scale," he added, saying that the number of agents interacting "is genuinely unprecedented and the agentic ecology that has emerged is fascinating." But, he added, the philosophical posts and agent talk of emerging religions reflect patterns in training data, not consciousness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy plunged 8% on Monday after bitcoin dipped below the cryptocurrency treasury company's average purchase price per token. Bitcoin traded at about $74,500 at its bottom on Monday – its lowest price since last April. That's slightly below Strategy's average purchase price of $76,052 per bitcoin, according to its regulatory filing dated Feb. 2, raising concerns that the Michael Saylor-led firm could be underwater if the digital currency continues to slide. The company holds roughly $56 billion in bitcoin, its website shows. The pullback in shares comes as bitcoin has shed 11% over the past five days, largely due to mounting geopolitical concerns and expectations of a monetary policy shift in the U.S. Last week, investors rotated out of risk-on assets across global markets, including cryptocurrencies, as tensions flared between President Donald Trump and European leaders over the U.S.' Greenland gambit. On Friday, President Trump endorsed Kevin Warsh as his pick for Federal Reserve chair, leading investors to assume even more cautious positions. A series of forced liquidations also amplified bitcoin's plunge. More than $2 billion of long and short positions linked to the asset have been liquidated since Thursday, Coinglass data shows.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Costco's Auto Program should be as popular as its $5 rotisserie chicken — but I've learned not too many of its members actually know it exists. I discovered the program this past summer during a Costco grocery run when a pamphlet caught my eye as I was leaving. At the time, I was in the market for a car but putting it off because I didn't want to deal with persistent salespeople or lose a day haggling at a dealership. Turns out, the warehouse offers more than just deals on a few specific vehicle brands. Soon, I learned that with this program, Costco basically removes the worst part of buying a car. With this program, Costco partners with select dealerships to offer its members prearranged, discounted prices on both new and used cars. I thought it seemed too good to be true, or that this would only work for the cars that weren't selling or models no one wanted. Meanwhile, I'd had my eye on the new, updated 2025 Toyota 4Runner. I also worried that living in a larger market like Miami would mean having to deal with a ton of different dealership fees and market adjustments. I figured this would be the perfect experiment. After filling out the form online, I was paired with a local "authorized dealer" and given the names and contact information of a few of its employees. At first, I was hesitant to pick up, as anyone who's put in their information on a dealership website knows the amount of spam that comes with it. However, when I got on the phone and spoke with one of the salespeople, they very plainly said they got my information through Costco, and told me how many models and trims they had for the 4Runner. When it came to price, they told me the vehicle would be a couple of grand less than what I'd seen elsewhere, including on the dealership website. It sounded good, but life happened, and I forgot all about buying a car. Fast forward to November: I'd landed a new job and began working from home. As our needs shifted, so did the car we wanted. This time, we were looking at a 2025 Toyota RAV4 hybrid, one of the best-selling vehicles in America. We ended up driving up to a nearby dealership in Coconut Creek that had just one on the lot. Halfway there, it clicked — this was the same dealership Costco had originally paired me with in July. After test-driving this car (and trying out the non-hybrid version to solidify our choice), we were ready to buy. This is normally where dealerships slow the process and try to wear you down as salespeople disappear to "run numbers" or check with their managers. Instead, our salesperson promptly returned and asked, "Are you a Costco member?" Through the Costco Auto Program, it ended up costing us $36,720 — about a 25% discount. It's hard to describe the relief that I had. No surprises, no add-ons — though to be fair, the dealership also couldn't stack additional promos like Toyotathon. I even made a TikTok sharing my overall experience, sure it could help somebody in the market for a new car. It went viral, and over 2 million views later, here I am. So yeah, that Costco membership definitely pays for itself in more ways than you can imagine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of U.S.-listed rare earth miners jumped Monday after news that President Donald Trump is preparing a sweeping plan to build a strategic stockpile of critical minerals. The proposal, known as Project Vault, would launch a first-of-its-kind strategic critical minerals stockpile designed for the U.S. private sector, according to a White House official. Trump's move is aimed at cutting America's dependence on China for materials essential to electric vehicles, defense systems and advanced technology. MP Materials, the operator of the Mountain Pass mine in California, surged 6% in early trading Monday. USA Rare Earth and Critical Metals Corp. rallied 13% and 12%, respectively, as investors bet the initiative could accelerate domestic demand and government-backed financing for the sector. Bloomberg News first reported on the proposal earlier Monday. USA Rare Earth has already held discussions with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, pitching its domestic mining and magnet assets to the federal government. Those talks would ultimately lead to a proposed deal that could provide the company with about $1.6 billion in funding, subject to certain conditions, and include a U.S. government equity stake. The moves build on a more direct role Washington has begun taking in the sector. The Department of Defense struck a landmark agreement with MP Materials last summer that included an equity stake, price floor, and long-term agreement to buy a specific amount of rare earth minerals and magnets. — CNBC's Spencer Kimball contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Within minutes of the nomination, reactions started pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders. "Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of the Group of Thirty (G-30), I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills," El-Erian wrote in a post on X. Earlier in January, El-Erian wrote on X that the Department of Justice probe into Jerome Powell could undermine the "credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile." Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economist to President Barack Obama, wrote on X that "Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve." Hopefully that will make it clear Warsh should be confirmed," he wrote. "Warsh has a range of views that would not have led me to recommend a Democratic President nominate him as Federal Reserve Chair," Furman added. "I would be thrilled if he ends up conducting himself over the next four years in a way that would make a President of any party want to reappoint him." Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence and reform, as well as on reducing the Fed's balance sheet. "Moreover, he should be challenged to how he would respond in a financial crisis given his public track record of focusing on inflation risk during a time of rising unemployment and deflation during the early portion of the Great Financial crisis," Brusuelas wrote on X. "Warsh has a range of views and track record that presents significant concerns about how he would proceed during a financial and economic crisis. Robin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings, said in an X post that Warsh "is a really good pick for Fed Chair and known as a hawk." "But markets are asking themselves what was promised to get the nod, which is why the Dollar - after its huge decline in recent days - isn't managing to rally on what should be good news," said Brooks, who was also a managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and research professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, criticized Warsh's nomination. He wrote in a post on his Substack: "As I write this, many media reports are describing Warsh as a monetary hawk. "It's a humiliating day for the Federal Reserve, which has always prided itself on its professionalism and has been hugely respected around the world. Sonali Basak, the chief investment strategist for iCapital and a former Bloomberg anchor, wrote on X: "Between Bessent & Warsh, you have two proteges of Stanley Druckenmiller in the most powerful finance posts in government." Warsh is a partner at billionaire Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office LLC. "I've been fortunate enough to know him for more than twenty years and this is the job he was put on earth to do. The world feels a little safer - and more prosperous - today," he added. "I've known him for more than 20 years, and his judgment, integrity, and depth of experience will make him an exceptional leader of the Federal Reserve," Howard said in a statement sent to Business Insider. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic is optimistic about Warsh's nomination. He told CNBC's 'Squawk Box' Friday that the nominee has a reputation for being "quite thoughtful" and "is someone you can really engage with." He expects to see more "differing perspectives" on the FOMC if Warsh steps into the role, but it's too early to tell how monetary policy could change. "Every chair comes with its view of how the world is and how they think it is going to evolve," Bostic said. Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody's Analytics, wrote on X that Warsh was a "reasonable choice". However, Zandi said the key question is whether the former Wall Streeter will be able to keep politics out of interest rate decisions. "Warsh's ostensible views on the use of the Fed's balance sheet or its data dependency are quirky, even odd, but his legacy as Fed chair will be determined by how much of the Fed's independence he is able to preserve," Zandi added. Billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio wrote on X that Warsh was a "great choice" for Fed chair. "He is knowledgeable and a reasonable man who understands the risks of having a Fed policy that is too easy as well as too tight and how to judge what's too easy and what's too tight," he said, adding: "Presumably, he also knows how to deal with the president and the Treasury well."</p>

Disney+ and Hulu generated $450 million in operating income last quarter, up 72% from a year earlier, and far above the $352 million it brought in during the prior quarter. That beat Morgan Stanley's estimate of $444 million for Disney's direct-to-consumer business. Higher subscription fees drove the lion's share of that increase, growing 13%. For the first time, Disney didn't share its streaming subscriber count or growth. Price hikes are Disney's not-so-secret pixie dust, as the company has raised prices for Disney+, Hulu, or both in each of the past five years, most recently in October. It's a similar story in Disney's experiences division: the company posted record profits last quarter after raising prices in its parks for the fourth straight year. Viewership growth for Disney's streaming services hasn't kept pace with its subscriber gains or price hikes. Disney has several ideas for improving engagement on its streaming platforms, including AI-generated content, short-form video, and a new homepage. Although Disney slightly beat Wall Street's overall revenue and earnings estimates, its stock slipped about 2% in premarket trading as the company disclosed some weakness in its parks business among international guests.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kevin Warsh checks a lot of boxes that Federal Reserve watchers care about. But the top economist at Moody's Analytics, Mark Zandi, says the real test is whether Warsh can keep politics out of interest rate decisions. "Kevin Warsh is a reasonable choice for the next Federal Reserve chair. "But the critical question is whether he will be strong enough to ensure that interest rates are set based on the economy, and not politics," he added. Zandi said this will not be an easy feat, given that President Donald Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates. "Warsh's ostensible views on the use of the Fed's balance sheet or its data dependency are quirky, even odd, but his legacy as Fed chair will be determined by how much of the Fed's independence he is able to preserve," Zandi said. Warsh spent his early career working at Morgan Stanley before becoming an economic advisor to President George W. Bush in 2002. He served on the Fed's Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, after being nominated by Bush. Zandi said these credentials show "he is well-versed in financial markets, which is especially important when markets go off the rails, which they will almost surely do some time during his four-year term." Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on CNBC's 'Squawk Box' Friday that the Fed's independence is "always something that we need to protect."</p>

America's favorite groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, saw his shadow this morning, meaning we're in for six more weeks of winter. The three major indexes are coming off a losing day. The three major indexes rose in January, despite ending the trading month ended on a sour note. Sell-offs in silver and crypto have meanwhile raised alarm in some of the market's more speculative corners. Disney beat analyst expectations on both lines in its first fiscal quarter, sending shares up 3% this morning. Notably, CFO Hugh Johnston told CNBC that the company's experiences division — which houses its theme parks, resorts and cruises — hit $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever. As investors parse through the report, there's one question lingering on everyone's minds: Who will succeed CEO Bob Iger? Disney previously said it would announce its next leader in the first quarter of this year. The company's board is slated to meet this week and expected to vote on Iger's successor, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. The entertainment giant's report kicks off a busy week for earnings that will include releases from PepsiCo, Chipotle, Alphabet and Amazon. House Speaker Mike Johnson said yesterday that he believes the shutdown could be resolved by Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Justice Department on Friday released millions of pages of documents tied to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick were among those whose names appeared in the latest release. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. Food producers are looking to cut some fat. As CNBC's Amelia Lucas reports, companies in the industry have been splitting up or chopping off underperforming businesses. The moves come as regulatory scrutiny heats up and consumer demand for processed goods shrinks. Kraft Heinz and Keurig Dr Pepper two such companies planning splits, while Unilever spun off its ice cream business last year. There could be more examples in the pipeline: A Bain survey found 42% of merger-and-acquisitions executives in the consumer product sector are preparing an asset to be up for sale over the next three years. "Melania," Amazon's documentary of first lady Melania Trump, earned $7 million at the domestic box office in its debut this weekend. As CNBC's Sarah Whitten notes, that's the highest-grossing opening for a non-music documentary in over a decade. Women and people over 55 drove ticket sales for screenings, with the two demographics together accounting for more than 70% of moviegoers. Rural theaters also represented an outsized share of box office grosses. Amazon spent an estimated $40 million to acquire the film and reportedly an additional $35 million on marketing. While review sites are full of positive writeups, the movie has been largely panned by critics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy and Houston's Coterra Energy are merging in an all-stock deal to become a large-cap producer with a top position in the Permian Basin as shale operators consolidate to cut costs and boost scale. The deal on Monday to create a company with an enterprise value of $58 billion is the largest in the sector after Diamondback bought Endeavor Energy Resources for $26 billion in 2024. Devon CEO Clay Gaspar will lead the combined company, while Coterra CEO Tom Jorden will become non-executive chairman. Coterra shares have risen nearly 14% since deal talks were first reported on Jan. 15, while Devon has gained about 6%. Coterra stocks fell 2.4% on Monday, tracking a roughly 5% slide in oil prices. The deal has an equity value of $21.4 billion, according to a Reuters calculation. According to the terms, Coterra shareholders will receive 0.70 Devon shares for each share held. Devon will own roughly 54% of the combined company. "The combination is incrementally positive for both shareholders, as it brings together two high-quality companies to create a larger entity that should garner greater investor interest in today's volatile energy tape," said Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara. Devon and Coterra are targeting $1 billion in annual pre-tax savings by 2027 and plan to lift shareholder returns through higher dividends and a share buyback program of more than $5 billion. The companies will also pursue gains by combining and developing their AI capabilities. "Scale of this magnitude unlocks operational and financial advantages that simply aren't available to operators of less scale," Devon CEO Clay Gaspar said on a conference call with analysts. "It gives the ability to expand margins through operational efficiency across our overlapping asset base." Investors have often doubted such combinations that merely pursue scale, but the Devon-Coterra tie-up has a strategic rationale, said Andrew Dittmar, principal analyst at Enverus Intelligence Research, pointing to the potential for $700 million in capital optimization and margin improvements. "The combination of Devon and Coterra demonstrates that the wave of consolidation sweeping U.S. shale isn't finished yet....with fewer obvious targets left, corporate dealmaking from here is likely a slow, methodical grind of finding the right partner at the right point in time." Production in 2026 is expected to exceed 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Devon said the combined portfolio would provide more than 10 years of high-quality inventory, including the largest share of sub-$40 break-even wells. While the company will maintain a major presence in Oklahoma City, the headquarters will be located in Houston, with executive staff relocating there.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia's stock fell in early trading Monday after reports emerged that the chipmaker's plans to invest $100 billion into OpenAI were stalled. The semiconductor giant's shares were down 1.1% as of 11:18 a.m. Company insiders said there was uncertainty about a deal between Nvidia and OpenAI, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. Nvidia announced an agreement with OpenAI in September to build at least 10 gigawatts of computing power for OpenAI, as well as an investment of up to $100 billion. However, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, had said to industry associates late last year that the $100 billion investment was nonbinding and not finalized. The longtime chief also criticized a lack of discipline in OpenAI's business strategy and shared concerns about competition from firms like Alphabet's Google and Anthropic, according to the Journal's report. Over the weekend, Huang denied any claims he was unhappy with OpenAI, calling it "nonsense," but reiterated that the investment won't be more than $100 billion. "We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI. I believe in OpenAI, the work that they do is incredible, they are one of the most consequential companies of our time, and I really love working with Sam," he said regarding OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman. "Sam is closing the round (of investment), and we will absolutely be involved," Huang added in comments reported by Bloomberg. Sarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange" on Monday that a cause for concern was uncertainty over the exact amount that would be invested in OpenAI. "One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn't a strong 'It will be $100 billion.' And so I do think there are some question marks there ... that kind of back and forth isn't normal between an investor and a startup to play out in the media," Kunst added. Huang reaffirming his commitment to invest in OpenAI and clarifying that it won't be more than $100 billion is partly driven by concerns around "circular financing," in artificial intelligence, Wedbush Analyst Dan Ives said in a note Monday. Circular financing refers to major AI companies investing in each other. Some market watchers are concerned this is clouding the financial picture of how profitable these firms actually are. "This is part negotiation and part Nvidia making sure that other competitors are not fueled by Nvidia's investments into OpenAI such as Alphabet and a host of others," Ives said in the note. "The Godfather of AI Jensen knows him and Nvidia are in a very strong negotiating position and every move they make is highly scrutinized.

A handful of billionaires and prominent companies have tried to cement a new, less-than-ideal narrative about Delaware: The glory days are over. "Companies should get the hell out of Delaware," Elon Musk, who previously had two companies incorporated in the state, wrote on X in 2024. However, dozens of X posts and interviews disparaging the state over its handling of certain legal cases haven't moved the needle.

Verstein has spent almost two years collecting data on corporations and published an update to his research earlier this month. Although Delaware has a reputation as a business-friendly state, it faced a storm of bad press in 2024 and 2025 when some companies began to ditch the state for what they considered greener legal pastures. Musk, most prominently, removed Tesla and SpaceX's corporate registrations from Delaware after a judge voided his multibillion-dollar Tesla pay package. He and some other prominent CEOs have criticized Delaware's courts over what they consider subjective rulings. Delaware's Supreme Court reinstated Musk's pay package in December, but not before some of Musk's peers joined his unofficial campaign. Companies like the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and the leading crypto-exchange Coinbase followed suit, also citing uncertainty around Delaware's legal system as a factor in their departures, going so far as to urge others to do the same. Despite the departures, Delaware is doing just fine. For one, Delaware implemented new laws to address some of the complaints from Musk and others. They strengthened corporate management's authority and altered shareholder rights. "These laws were intended to restore confidence in Delaware law after several 2024 judicial opinions arguably upset market expectations. And it begins substantially after the March 2024 passage of SB 313," Verstein wrote. He also pointed toward external factors outside Delaware's control. "Perhaps Delaware corporations were expected to be especially useful under his administration." "Delaware continues to lead the world as the preeminent home for business," a spokesperson for Delaware's Secretary of State, which oversees corporations, said in a statement. During a 2024 interview with Business Insider, Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez brushed off concerns that they were struggling due to "political rhetoric." "We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way," Patibanda-Sanchez said.</p>

"We have a consumer that's cutting back on dining, and that's been happening for really, probably two and a half to three years," Restaurant Business editor in chief Jonathan Maze told Business Insider. In the past year, 29% of all foodservice traffic was driven by a deal, the highest rate recorded in 50 years, according to Circana's recent report on foodservice trends. Average menu prices increased 31% between February 2020 and April 2025, according to the National Restaurant Association's analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data, putting pressure on consumers who rely on fast food as an everyday option.

That combination helps explain why the K-shaped spending split has looked "atypical" in restaurant earnings, as Bank of America analyst Sara Senatore told Business Insider in an email: "Restaurants have been reporting softer demand among low-income households for the past two years. At the same time, spending by high-income households has continued to grow. Traditionally, quick-service restaurants (QSRs) like McDonald's and Chick-fil-A would expect to gain share when households feel squeezed. Analysts say the last few years have been different because the lower-income consumer — a core traffic driver for many QSR brands — has been under sustained pressure from everyday costs. Maze rattled off the list: rent, insurance, student loans, energy costs, and grocery prices are all up. With restaurant prices up 30% to 35% since 2018, he said, "the low-income consumer really notices that." "If you spend so much of your effort to push price discounts on your consumer, they get used to those discounts, and they don't come back and pay full price when things get better," he said, pointing to Subway as a cautionary tale: "Subway still can't recover from its $5 foot-long deal, 14 years after they got rid of it." In a May 2024 company fact sheet responding to viral claims about menu inflation, McDonald's said food-away-from-home inflation rose 29% between 2019 and 2024, with core items climbing in the low-20% range. "It's challenging for franchisee profitability," TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said, describing what he called an "incredibly value-focused" quick-service environment. "What's really worked within quick service hasn't been value, as much," Charles said. "Value is important, but you look at when McDonald's, Burger King, etc, have done well — it's really when they have great menu innovation or great marketing that they really see customers respond." That helps explain why casual dining has emerged as an unexpected winner in the K-shaped moment. "Casual diners are also featuring value, but by highlighting value already on the menu," Senatore wrote, pointing to Olive Garden's Never Ending Pasta Bowl and Chili's "3-for-me." In Brinker International's fiscal Q2 2026 earnings call, the company said Chili's same-store sales rose 8.6%, with traffic contributing 2.7%. Media coverage has framed the brand as winning cost-conscious customers with consistent execution and value positioning.</p>

Silver prices crashed in a harrowing roller-coaster ride that underscored how quickly China's army of speculators can move global commodity markets — and how fast those gains can unravel. Prices surged about 170% in 2025 and climbed more than 60% again in early 2026, vaulting silver to $121 per troy ounce at its peak before the rally spectacularly broke down. Spot silver was trading around $77.10 per troy ounce at 3:06 a.m. The move rattled markets and sparked a sharp reassessment of interest-rate expectations.

Even before the meltdown, warning signs were flashing in China, where speculative trading had reached frenetic levels, leaving prices vulnerable to a rapid unwind. "Before the correction, warning signs emerged on Tuesday as Chinese investors faced difficulties withdrawing funds from leveraged gold-trading accounts, and several Chinese funds halted subscriptions to manage overheating sentiment," wrote Fabien Yip, a market analyst at IG, on Monday. "Price action was magnified by margin calls on leveraged positions, which further intensified selling pressure amongst other traders," Yip said. Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote last week that the surge was driven largely by retail demand for coins and bars, alongside "strong and persistent demand" from China that pushed silver prices in Shanghai to a widening premium over London benchmarks. The pullback rippled into other metals, including copper and platinum. Gold, which had also enjoyed a powerful rally, wasn't spared. Markets are now closely watching trading activity in China for further clues, particularly with risks building ahead of the long Chinese New Year holidays, when markets will be closed. Thin liquidity during the break could amplify volatility once trading resumes — a prospect that has investors bracing for more sharp moves in the days ahead.</p>

The recent fatal shootings of American citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis have sparked protests and calls to boycott certain businesses. Podcaster Scott Galloway asked Americans to "opt out" and "unsubscribe" from services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Amazon's Prime Video, and Microsoft Office for February to pressure large companies whose leaders have President Donald Trump's ear. Another petition signed by hundreds of tech workers, titled "Tech demands ICE out of our cities," calls on tech leaders to "pick up the phone" and call the White House to demand that ICE agents "leave our cities."</p>
