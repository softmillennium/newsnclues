                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oleksandra Oliynykova claimed the first WTA main-draw win of her career late on Sunday night at the Transylvania Open, overcoming Mayar Sherif 6-7(6), 6-4, 6-4 in 2 hours and 54 minutes from 3-1 down in the third set -- and revealed afterward that she was lucky to be at the tournament at all. The Ukrainian captured hearts two weeks ago at the Australian Open with her positive demeanor, valiant first-round challenge against defending champion Madison Keys and heartfelt words about her soldier father on her country's frontline. "I live and practice in Kyiv and because of Russian attacks, we have very big problems with electricity. Two hours before my train -- because I live on the 20th floor -- I'm entering the lift and electricity just turns off. In the end, I was just 10 minutes before my train left. "I just said to myself, 'C'mon, there was a possibility that you would not come to this tournament. And actually, that was the key today to win." There was plenty of creativity on show from both players throughout the enthralling contest. Lung-busting rallies and chess-like tactics were the order of the day as Oliynykova and Sherif deployed every tool at their disposal to out-manoeuvre each other. A series of exquisite drop shots from the Egyptian saw her sneak a top-quality first-set tiebreak after saving one set point, but Oliynykova bounced back superbly. Her variety and point construction proved crucial: Oliynykova frequently used high moonballs as an offensive weapon, pushing Sherif behind the baseline before flattening out her own strokes for winners.</p>

Djokovic, who had reached the record-extending 38th Grand Slam final of his career in Melbourne this year—and who was going for a record-extending 25th major title, as well—congratulated Alcaraz right out of the gates during his speech at the on-court trophy ceremony.“What you've been doing, I think the best word to describe it is historic, legendary,” the 24-time Grand Slam champion said. “So congratulations, and I wish you the best of luck for the rest of your career.“I mean, you're so young, you have a lot of time, like myself,” he added. “I'm sure we'll see each other many more times in the next 10 years!”Likewise, Alcaraz started his speech by congratulating Djokovic. "Obviously, first of all, I just wanted to talk about Novak. He deserves an ovation, for sure," the now-seven-time major winner said.
