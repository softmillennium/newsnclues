                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tufts University School of Medicine is expanding its Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) programs with the launch of a new location in Atlanta, joining programs in Boston, Phoenix, and Seattle. Students complete a combination of synchronous and asynchronous online coursework while participating in immersive, in-person clinical skills labs. Applications will open through the Physical Therapist Centralized Application Service (PTCAS) in June 2026, with plans to enroll the first cohort in Fall 2027. The Southeast is one of the fastest-growing regions in the United States, and we are proud to bring Tufts University School of Medicine's DPT curriculum closer to students and communities across this dynamic region. By bringing a Tufts DPT program to the area, we can better support aspiring clinicians in the Southeast, strengthen relationships with local healthcare providers, and help address the critical need for highly skilled physical therapists." Students in the Tufts DPT program complete 127 semester credit hours over seven consecutive semesters-an accelerated timeline compared to traditional nine-semester programs-with online coursework that offers flexibility to accommodate different lifestyles. The curriculum emphasizes integrated learning across clinical tracks, helping students develop a deep understanding of human movement systems through repetition, scaffolding, and progressive complexity. Coursework is intentionally designed to connect foundational science, clinical reasoning, and hands-on practice. In addition, the program incorporates social determinants of health throughout the curriculum, preparing graduates to understand how social, economic, community, educational, and accessibility factors influence patient outcomes and quality of life. Applications to Tufts DPT programs in Boston, Phoenix, and Seattle are currently open. The Atlanta program will begin accepting applications in June.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bats, critical reservoirs of viruses with significant cross-species spillover risks, have long been understudied in the Indochina Peninsula. A study led by researchers from Beijing University of Chemical Technology, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and their partners has unveiled the region's bat virome diversity, offering key insights into the origins of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and critical surveillance priorities. They identified 137 viral strains across 27 families, including 40 novel species. Rhinolophidae bats from China's Yunnan and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region provinces exhibited the highest viral diversity, with 13 viral families and MERS-like coronaviruses. In contrast, Cambodian bats harbored viruses that were evolutionarily distant from known strains. This virus (CB_Mo.plicatus_PEDV-like_1) shared 90.36% genome homology with the PEDV CV777 strain and displayed a recombinant structure, combining suid-adapted ORF1ab and bat-adapted Spike genes. Recombination analysis of 18 sequences revealed mosaicism in 16, with five regions showing no breakpoints (BFRs), emphasizing the frequency of viral genetic exchange. Deep learning models further highlighted host adaptation risks. The ORF1ab of the PEDV-related virus showed a preference for suids (pigs), while its Spike gene favored bats, raising concerns about potential spillover if mutations occur. We call for enhanced cross-border 'One Health' initiatives targeting bat-human interfaces and recombination hotspots to prevent future zoonotic outbreaks."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Interoceptive, visceral pain from within the body is perceived more unpleasant than exteroceptive pain from outside the body. A new study shows that the type of pain also influences how we empathize with others. The type of pain influences how unpleasantly we perceive it: Visceral pain from inside the body, such as stomach ache, feels worse than somatic pain, like when we burn our finger. A medical study at Ruhr University Bochum has shown that this is not only the case when we are personally in pain, but it also influences empathy for pain when others are affected. The researchers recruited 30 healthy participants, all of whom were in a committed relationship for at least three months. The study was conducted on four days. The participants evaluated these two types of pain from their own perspective and from the perspective of both their Loved-one and an unknown individual. Six days later, they were asked to imagine how they personally, their Loved-one, and an unknown person would perceive the pain. The researchers determined how unpleasant the participants rated the pain, how personally aroused they felt by imagining pain for different people, and how much empathy they felt. Two days after this, the participants again rated their empathic responses when recalling the pain using online based ratings. "The study shows that interoceptive, visceral pain induces stronger cognitive, affective, and empathic responses than does somatic pain. The participants graded visceral pain as more intense and unpleasant than the pain caused by heat, and felt more empathic concern and personal distress, both for themselves and when imagining their Loved-one or a stranger experiencing such pain. This difference remained stable even in the absence of noxious stimulation eight days after painful stimuli were applied." The results help to understand how interoceptive bodily threats influence psychosocial behavior. The study also paves the way for future research into predictive factors for empathic reactions both in patients with pain as well as in the people who care for them, such as caregivers and healthcare professionals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have created a complete map showing how hundreds of possible mutations in a key cancer gene influence tumor growth. When β-catenin is disrupted, cells can begin uncontrolled growth – a hallmark of cancer. By systematically testing all possible mutations in a priority area of the gene in mouse cells, the map helps explain why certain mutations appear in specific cancers and could guide the development of new treatments, experts say. Many cancers carry mutations in a small 'hotspot' region of CTNNB1. Normally, this region acts like a tag that marks β-catenin for destruction when it is no longer needed. Mutations in the hotspot remove this tag, causing β-catenin to accumulate and activate genes that drive tumor growth. In the study, researchers from the University of Edinburgh tested all 342 possible single changes in this hotspot using mouse stem cells. These cells are particularly well suited to precise genome editing, and β-catenin signalling is highly conserved between mice and humans. Using genome-editing tools and a fluorescent test, the team measured how strongly each mutation activates the β-catenin pathway – a signalling system that switches on genes driving cell growth. The analysis also revealed that cancers arising in different tissues tend to select mutations that generate different levels of β-catenin activity. In liver cancer, two major groups of tumours emerged: those with weaker CTNNB1 mutations, which contained more immune cells, and those with stronger mutations, which had fewer. Researchers say this suggests that mutation strength may influence how a tumor interacts with the immune system – and potentially how it responds to immunotherapy. The new map provides a powerful tool for predicting how specific CTNNB1 mutations affect cancer behaviour and could support the development of more personalized treatments. As the first study to experimentally test every possible mutation in this critical hotspot, it gives scientists a clearer picture of how β-catenin drives tumor growth across different cancer types." The study is published in Nature Genetics: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02496-5 [URL will become active when embargo lifts] and was supported by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kinases, which catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to protein, lipid, or nucleotide substrates, play a critical role in signal transmission, cell cycle control, and metabolic regulation. Dysregulated kinase activity has been linked to a variety of human diseases, including cancers, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative ailments, due to its key role in cellular physiology.1,2 SwiftFluo® TR-FRET kinase kits provide a highly sensitive, selective, simple, and rapid assay platform to help researchers decode kinase biology while also expediting small molecule drug discovery and lead optimization. The phosphorylated product is subsequently recognized by a phospho-specific antibody tagged with Solar Eu (donor) and collected using a streptavidin-linked acceptor (HX or LA). The SwiftFluo® CDK kits, on the other hand, use a streamlined dual-component system that includes a TR-FRET donor-labeled phospho-specific antibody and a directly acceptor-labeled protein substrate (Rb [S780] and ATF2 [T71]), allowing for the rapid and sensitive quantification of CDK target activity (CDK1, 2, 5, 9, etc. In contrast to typical FRET tests reliant on short-lived fluorescent dyes that frequently suffer from quick signal attenuation, strong background interference, and photobleaching under repeated excitation, TR FRET uses lanthanide donors such as europium (Eu) or terbium (Tb). With this low interference, TR FRET has significantly improved signal-to-noise ratios and provides consistent, reproducible readouts, ideal for high-throughput kinase profiling and inhibitor screening. Additionally, unlike ELISA or MSD, they do not require wash steps, resulting in a more efficient workflow and increased test throughput. With coverage of main kinase classes (TKs, STKs, and CDKs), the platform provides flexibility and scalability for a variety of drug development activities. These kits have been previously validated with substrates, antibodies, and buffers tuned for over 200 kinases, including disease-relevant targets such as EGFR, FLT3, JAK2, BRK, AMPK, ROCK1, CDK1, CDK5, and many more. The SwiftFluo® TR-FRET kinase kits are ideal for enzymatic activity validation, allowing researchers to characterize recombinant kinases and ensure lot-to-lot uniformity. The kits enable reproducible dose-response tests with excellent signal stability for IC50 and EC50 assessments, making it easier to assess compound potency. They are also suitable for developing a uniform screening platform in which the same assay format may be used for TKs, STKs, and CDKs, with optimum conditions specific to each kinase class to enable consistent kinase profiling. In addition, the kits' uniform, no-wash structure and robust assay performance make them ideal for industrial HTS studies that require rapid triaging of chemical libraries. The assay is fully compatible with microplate readers equipped with a TR-FRET detection module and can be scaled to 96-, 384-, and 1536-well plates, allowing for simple incorporation into automated screening workflows. SwiftFluo® TR-FRET kinase kits integrate cutting-edge detection technology with assay simplicity to provide a powerful toolkit for determining kinase activity, screening compounds, and optimizing leads. With excellent sensitivity, broad kinase compatibility, and seamless HTS integration, these kits enable researchers to speed up discovery workflows and obtain high-confidence data across a wide range of therapeutic targets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The study points to a new immunotherapy approach that could help preserve viable neurons in people with this diagnosis. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in a specific brain region known as the substantia nigra. However, the precise mechanisms that trigger this destructive process are still not fully understood. Now, in an article published in npj Parkinson's Disease, researchers from the Institut de Neurociències of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (INc-UAB) and the UAB Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology report that brain tissue from Parkinson's disease patients contains a higher proportion of reactive microglia, meaning cells that are primed to respond. But most importantly, these reactive microglial cells also show an increased density of receptors known as Fc gamma on their membranes. Under normal conditions, Fc gamma receptors help identify damaged cells or harmful components that need to be removed from the brain, triggering the normal microglia's cleaning response. However, the INc-UAB team suggests that in Parkinson's disease, these overexpressed receptors mistakenly identify still-functional neurons as damaged, setting off an inappropriate elimination process. According to the study, when Fc gamma receptors are activated upon detecting dopaminergic neurons, even those that are still functioning, they cause the microglial cell to change shape through the activation of a cytoskeletal protein called Cdc42. What is particularly interesting is that in animal and cellular models of the disease, blocking Fc gamma receptors with immunotherapy, as well as pharmacologically inhibiting Cdc42, significantly reduced the elimination of dopaminergic neurons, preserving them even under conditions of intense neuroinflammation." These findings suggest that regulating microglial phagocytosis through immunotherapy targeting Fc gamma receptors, or their downstream signaling protein Cdc42, could slow disease progression and help protect the function of remaining dopaminergic neurons.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A national clinical trial led by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology has found that oxybutynin, a drug often used to treat overactive bladder symptoms, reduces hot flashes compared to the placebo in men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer. Oxybutynin demonstrated clear and clinically meaningful improvements in both hot flash frequency and quality of life for men undergoing hormone therapy for prostate cancer. These results provide strong support for its use as an effective management option for this challenging and often overlooked side effect of prostate cancer treatment." Bradley J. Stish, MD, study's lead investigator and radiation oncologist, Mayo Clinic Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective treatment against prostate cancer as it lowers male hormones like testosterone needed to fuel cancer cells. The Phase II randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial evaluated whether two doses of oxybutynin (2.5 mg twice daily and 5 mg twice daily) could improve hot flash symptoms compared with placebo over six weeks. The study enrolled 88 men from 15 academic and community cancer centers; 81 participants were eligible for final analysis. In this trial, both doses of oxybutynin substantially improved hot flash symptoms compared to the placebo over the six‑week treatment period. Men receiving placebo experienced an average reduction of 2.15 hot flashes per day and a 4.85‑point drop in daily hot flash severity scores, whereas those taking 2.5 mg of oxybutynin twice daily reported reductions of 4.77 hot flashes per day and a 9.94‑point decrease in severity, and those receiving 5 mg twice daily experienced the largest improvements, with 6.89 fewer hot flashes per day and a 13.95‑point reduction in severity. The proportion of patients achieving at least a 50 percent reduction in hot flash scores was also markedly higher with oxybutynin: 57 percent in the 2.5 mg group and 79 percent in the 5 mg group, compared with 32 percent taking placebo. Dry mouth was the most common side effect reported. "These results are incredibly encouraging," added Dr. Stish. "Men with hot flashes from hormone therapy now have another therapeutic option available to help reduce their symptom burden.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new review finds that while the carnivore diet may deliver short-term improvements, weak evidence and emerging risks make long-term adherence a gamble for health. Study: Carnivore Diet: A Scoping Review of the Current Evidence, Potential Benefits and Risks. In a recent review published in Nutrients, researchers determined the nutritional adequacy and health effects of the carnivore diet (CD). The CD is characterized by minimally processed animal-based foods like fish, meat, eggs, seafood, animal fats, and full-fat dairy products, and, as a result, can also be considered a low-carbohydrate/high-fat dietary pattern. The CD has been claimed to be associated with numerous health benefits, including weight reduction, self-reported improvements in physical and cognitive performance, and a reported reduction in the risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and gastrointestinal disorders. These purported benefits are attributed to the lack of exposure to antinutritional compounds (ANs) found in plant-based foods, including enzyme inhibitors, lectins, phytic acid, oxalic acid, tannins, goitrogens, and saponins, which are secondary plant metabolites that may interfere with nutrient absorption. Importantly, the lack of plant-based foods in the CD also prevents intake of important phytochemicals, dietary fiber, and essential micronutrients. Furthermore, the high intake of animal-based foods, particularly red and processed meat, is consistently associated, in broader epidemiological studies, with a greater risk of cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, and mortality. Overall, nine eligible studies published between 2021 and 2025 were analyzed, of which included five case studies, two surveys, one comparative modeling study, and one exploratory study. Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in the United States, with the definition of CD varying across studies. All but three studies completely excluded plant-based foods. In one study, CD was used as an elimination diet but was subsequently transitioned to a ketogenic meat-centered pattern. Similarly, another study evaluated a ketogenic CD variant. In one survey, respondents followed a zero-carbohydrate diet that primarily involved meat, including organ meats. Two studies developed and assessed theoretical dietary plans based on nutrient intake, rather than the healthy eating index or dietary reference values (DRVs). Furthermore, three studies evaluated the effects of CD on urological, gynecological, and gastrointestinal conditions. In two studies, multiple nutrients were categorized as insufficient compared to DRVs. More specifically, reported intakes were below the DRVs for thiamin, magnesium, iron, calcium, potassium, iodine, folate, and vitamins C and D. Whereas dietary fiber intake was lower than recommended levels, vitamin A intake exceeded recommended levels, particularly in diets high in liver-derived retinol. Four studies reported self-reported or clinically observed positive effects on disease course, allowing for discontinuation or reduction of medication in some cases. In one study, several laboratory parameters, including the triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, C-reactive protein, and γ-glutamyl transferase, improved during CD. However, both studies also observed increases in total cholesterol (TC), platelet counts, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Triglycerides and glycated hemoglobin improved in individuals with metabolic disorders who initiated CD, although LDL-C and TC were significantly elevated. One case report observed deterioration of the patient's health while following the CD, with an unfavorable 24-hour urine profile. One year after CD cessation, this patient no longer experienced kidney stones. One study found no significant differences in gut microbiome diversity and functionality between an omnivorous diet and CD. Motivations for adopting a CD included perceived health benefits, and to a lesser extent, ethical considerations, and perceptions of naturalness. Many people reported improvements in overall health while emphasizing the simplicity of the diet and positive sensory experience associated with consuming animal-based foods. Notably, one study found that people following a zero-carbohydrate/CD lifestyle often had social conflict outside the CD community, including challenges interacting with healthcare professionals and tensions within friendship and family networks. Following the CD may provide short-term health improvements, with these effects likely attributed to placebo responses, subjective perceptions, and ketosis-related metabolic adaptations. However, the CD may increase the risk of cardiovascular and renal complications, as well as micronutrient deficiencies, low fiber intake, and adverse lipid profile changes. Due to limitations in the existing scientific evidence on CD, including the lack of control groups, short intervention durations, and small sample sizes, it is not possible to assess the long-term safety of CD.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ascending aortic hemiarch reconstruction offers the same long-term benefits to patients over age 65 with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) as more complex extended arch reconstruction procedures, according to a study presented today at the 2026 Society of Thoracic Surgeons Annual Meeting. The finding came from a risk-adjusted analysis of 3,562 patients examining long-term survival and surgical reintervention for aortic disease following initial operation for ATAAD. Patient data came from the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (ACSD), containing nearly 8.5 million adult cardiac surgery procedure records and linked to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services database. Of the ATAAD patients studied, 74.2% underwent aortic hemiarch replacement and 25.8% underwent extended arch reconstruction at a US hospital between July 2017 and December 2023. Acute dissections affecting the ascending aorta usually require emergency surgery, often in patients aged 65 or older. Cardiovascular surgeons have many options when planning surgery for these patients, said John R. Spratt, MD, clinical assistant professor of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at University of Florida Health, a center with one of the highest aortic surgery volumes in the nation. Depending on the technique used, most extended arch reconstructions carry greater short-term operative risk due to the need for longer periods of cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiac arrest, and more advanced forms of cerebral protection that are needed during the procedure compared with ascending hemiarch reconstruction. Extended arch reconstruction may decrease the long-term risk of requiring additional open aortic surgery. However, older patients have a shorter overall life expectancy and the extent to which they can reap these benefits is unclear." "It is important to balance what the 'ideal' reconstruction may be when reviewing a CT scan with the overall risk profile of an individual patient. Based on our analysis, most patients age 65 and older undergoing repair of acute dissection will be fine with hemiarch reconstruction and have the same long-term outcomes as they would with a higher-risk procedure," said Spratt. With more than 95% of adult cardiac surgery procedures and the largest and most robust clinical thoracic surgical database in the US, data and outcomes from the STS Database provide true national benchmarks for clinical outcomes of cardiothoracic surgery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international research consortium, led by scientists at VIB and UGent, has developed a new platform that could change how antibody medicines are tested and brought to patients. The work, published in Science Immunology, highlights problems during conventional antibody drug testing and introduces a next-generation mouse model that makes it possible to predict the effects of antibody drugs in humans more accurately. Antibody-based medicines are widely used to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Many of these drugs look extremely promising during early testing. However, a large number later fail in clinical trials or show unexpected side effects. This slows down drug development, drives up costs, and can put patients at risk. "Our new platform allows us to study antibody function in conditions that are much closer to what happens in patients," says Prof. Bart Lambrecht (VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research), senior author of the study. "That means we can make better, more confident decisions much earlier in drug development." These systems have been essential for medical progress, but new research shows they do not always reflect how the human immune system works, especially for antibody drugs. The challenge is that these Fcγ receptors differ substantially between species. The study shows that the human immune system responds to antibody drugs in ways that are not always captured during early testing, with real-world consequences. Even more importantly, human platelets, the cells that control blood clotting, can be directly activated by certain antibodies. This mechanism does not exist in mice, meaning dangerous clotting risks can remain hidden during early testing. Other immune cells can also react in opposite ways depending on the system used. Because of these differences, antibody drugs can appear safe or effective early on, only to behave very differently in patients. A well-known example is the development of anti-CD40L antibodies, which progressed to clinical trials after reassuring early results but later caused severe blood clots and patient deaths. To solve this problem, the researchers first created a detailed map showing how Fcγ receptors are distributed across immune cells in humans and commonly used testing systems. They then used this information to build a new mouse model that closely reflects how the human immune system handles antibodies. In contrast to existing humanized mouse models, this new model uses a more precise genetic 'knock-in' strategy and is made commercially available, guaranteeing access for academic researchers and drug developers alike. The new platform has been rigorously validated across multiple disease settings. It enables researchers to reliably rank antibody candidates by true biological effectiveness, assess how well antibodies remove specific immune cells, and evaluate how antibodies limit disease progression for example in the context of cancer. These types of comparisons are difficult or impossible with conventional approaches. According to dr. Karel Van Damme (VIB-UGent, UZ Gent), first author of the study, "Modern antibody development increasingly depends on subtle molecular fine-tuning. Our platform allows different antibody designs to be compared head-to-head in a biologically meaningful way, reducing guesswork." Beyond its scientific importance, the platform offers major economic advantages for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. At the same time, more accurate early evaluation supports improved patient safety. The approach also aligns with evolving expectations from regulatory authorities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two Cambridge-led studies suggest that the psychological distress caused by lockdowns (UK) and experience of infection (US) was reduced among those of faith compared to non-religious people. People of religious faith may have experienced lower levels of unhappiness and stress than secular people during the UK's Covid-19 lockdowns in 2020 and 2021, according to a new University of Cambridge study released as a working paper. The findings follow recently published Cambridge-led research suggesting that worsening mental health after experiencing Covid infection - either personally or in those close to you - was also somewhat ameliorated by religious belief. This study looked at the US population during early 2021. University of Cambridge economists argue that - taken together - these studies show that religion may act as a bulwark against increased distress and reduced wellbeing during times of crisis, such as a global public health emergency. Selection biases make the wellbeing effects of religion difficult to study. Larcom and his Cambridge colleagues Prof Sriya Iyer and Dr Po-Wen She analyzed survey data collected from 3,884 people in the UK during the first two national lockdowns, and compared it to three waves of data prior to the pandemic. They found that while lockdowns were associated with a universal uptick in unhappiness, the average increase in feeling miserable was 29% lower for people who described themselves as belonging to a religion. Those for whom religion makes "some or a great difference" in their lives experienced around half the increase in unhappiness seen in those for whom religion makes little or no difference. "The study suggests that it is not just being religious, but the intensity of religiosity that is important when coping with a crisis," said Larcom. The research team "controlled" for these statistically to try and isolate the effects caused by faith alone, and still found that the probability of religious people having an increase in depression was around 20% lower than non-religious people. However, the team did find that wellbeing among some religious groups appeared to suffer more than others when places of worship were closed during the first lockdown. "The denial of weekly communal attendance appears to have been particularly affecting for Catholics and Muslims," said Larcom. Researchers found that almost half those who reported a Covid-19 infection either in themselves or their immediate social network experienced an associated reduction in wellbeing. Where mental health declined, it was around 60% worse on average for the non-religious compared to people of faith with typical levels of "religiosity". Interestingly, the positive effects of religion were not found in areas with strictest lockdowns, suggesting access to places of worship might be even more important in a US context. The study also found significant uptake of online religious services, and a 40% lower association between Covid-19 and mental health for those who used them. "Religious beliefs may be used by some as psychological resources that can shore up self-esteem and add coping skills, combined with practices that provide social support," said Prof Iyer, from Cambridge's Faculty of Economics. It may be that religious faith builds resilience, and helps people cope with adversity by providing hope, consolation and meaning in tumultuous times."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An updated report on cystic fibrosis (CF) from Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, in partnership with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), highlights the new national guidelines on CF newborn screening that aim to detect affected babies earlier, more accurately and more fairly. Currently, newborns in every state are screened for CF. Delays more often occur in diagnosis of infants who are Black, Hispanic, or Asian, in part because these groups tend to have CF-causing gene variants that are rarer and seldom included in the newborn screening panels. These infants frequently screen negative and get diagnosed much later when they exhibit symptoms. "The new recommendations are designed to improve detection of CF in babies from all racial and ethnic backgrounds," said report co-author and co-senior author on the CF guidelines Susanna McColley, MD, an internationally recognized expert in CF newborn screening, pediatric pulmonologist at Lurie Children's and Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. In 2014, 40 percent of infants with CF were first seen for testing after this optimal timeframe. The improved timeliness in evaluation for CF is encouraging. However, we still see delays in a third of the cases, so more needs to be done to increase awareness among families and primary care providers that earlier diagnosis dramatically improves symptoms and ultimately survival." The report cites evidence that babies with CF who are diagnosed in the first two weeks of life have better nutrition at 1 and 5 years of age than babies who are diagnosed during the second month of life. "We urge parents to work with their child's pediatric care provider to assure diagnostic evaluation for CF within a few days of a positive newborn screening test for CF, so that treatment can begin as soon as possible if their baby has CF." Dr. McColley also cautioned that CF newborn screening results can be false-negative, especially in infants who are Black or Asian. "Infants of any race or background showing clinical signs of CF, including bowel obstruction and growth faltering, should be referred for diagnostic evaluation even if the newborn screening results are normal," she said.
