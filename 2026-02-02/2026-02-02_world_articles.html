                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York) said on Sunday that one of his most important jobs as Senate minority leader is to “fight for aid to Israel,” as the Trump administration's masked federal agents continue their deadly raids of the U.S. with little to no pushback from Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) also spoke at the event. Implicit in that remark is denigration of those within his own caucus, like Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), who have previously backed legislation to block aid to Israel as it's committed genocide in the Gaza Strip. On Friday, the State Department approved nearly $7 billion in weapons sales for Israel, including 30 Apache attack helicopters and equipment for other vehicles — despite the “ceasefire” deal underway in Gaza and no other active wars with Israel ongoing. “Just one hour before doing so, the Trump Administration informed me it would disregard Congressional oversight and years of standing practice, and immediately notify over $6 billion dollars in arms sales to Israel. This is yet another repudiation by Donald Trump of Congress' Constitutional oversight role,” said Meeks. Meeks said that the Trump administration has “refused” to provide any senior administration officials for a briefing on the sale, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio has “failed to provide any justification or documentation for bypassing” review for the sale. At the same time, Schumer is already facing criticism for his lack of energy in leading Democrats against Trump's immigration raids. Just days before, Schumer had struck a deal with the White House to help avoid a prolonged government shutdown, funding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for two weeks while negotiations on his demands are ongoing. This is another reason I will be voting no on the Senate amended appropriations bill which includes ‘more security assistance to Israel … than ever, ever before,'” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) in response to Schumer's remarks on social media. “No House Democrat should vote yes on a bill that leaves in place triple ICE funding and massive aid to Israel.” As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Saturday Night Live” this weekend featured one of its best political sketches in years. It's about a mother who dramatically reveals to her children that she's having sudden reservations about President Donald Trump. The right can enjoy the insufferable liberal adult children marring their mom's moment of vulnerability with their apoplectic I-told-you-sos. But how much does this mother reflect reality? At the same time, it's not clear how many of them were truly MAGA to begin with. And they generally express their emotions more subtly than the full-on regret that Trump's critics have long sought. A number of polls have gotten at this question in recent weeks. A Pew Research Center poll, for one, suggested significant erosion in Trump's support on the right. Perhaps more strikingly, it showed the percentage of these voters who said they support “all” or “most” of Trump's policies dropping from 67% in February 2025 to 56% in late January. Fox News and New York Times-Siena College polls both recently broke out data on 2024 Trump voters, and the detractors were in many cases significant. The survey also tested a dozen specific issues, and on 10 of the 12 – everything except border security and immigration – Trump's disapproval rating among his 2024 voters was north of 20%. It was at least 25% on half of those issues. That's significant to have 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 Trump voters so consistently on a different page than the president. But again, other data points were worse for him: It suggests people might be understandably reluctant to say they disapprove of Trump when you asked for a straight up-or-down verdict. But the disapproval shows up more when you dig a little deeper and ask about specific things. And that tracks with what we've seen before when it comes to the more specific subject of Trump voter “regret.” We unfortunately don't have good recent, high-quality data on Trump voter regret. The previous data also suggested these kinds of emotions could be building – slowly and subtly – even if they haven't necessarily manifested themselves as full-on regret. A University of Massachusetts Amherst poll, for instance, showed the percentage of Trump voters who were “very confident” in their 2024 vote dropping from 74% in April to 69% in August. Only 1% said they regretted their vote, but about 3 in 10 had some kinds of reservations about it – ranging from “some regrets” (2%) and “mixed feelings” (6%) to remaining confident in their vote but having “some concerns” (19%). The data suggest Trump voters could actually be underselling their overall disenchantment with him, to some degree. They might not be full-on regretful or disapproving, but they seem to be coming to certain realizations about what Trump is doing – a lot like the mother in the sketch. But just like the mother in the sketch, they might be apprehensive about admitting that to those around them (or even to a pollster). After all, nobody likes to admit they were wrong – especially when the other side is so annoying about it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Monday announced he would reduce tariffs on Indian goods in exchange for, among other things, a promise to stop buying Russian oil. That will be a tall task: India has been importing roughly 1.5 million barrels of Russian oil each day — even months after Trump placed tariffs on Indian goods as punishment — according to Kpler, a global trade data provider. Russian oil makes up more than a third of India's overall imports. Trump said in a social media post that he spoke Monday morning with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who agreed to replace the country's Russian crude imports with oil from Venezuela and the United States. Venezuelan oil is of the same quality as Russian oil — heavy, sour and perfect for making derivatives like fuel oil and diesel, which India's refineries are already set up to process, noted Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital. It's not clear, however, how long that transition may take. Venezuela's oil infrastructure is dilapidated and requires about a decade of work and tens of billions of investment dollars to return it to the more-than-3 million barrels a day output it had achieved before the country's Socialist government took control in 1999. India also buys more oil from Russia than Venezuela produces. “Fully replacing Russian oil with oil from Venezuela or the US will take significant investment,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Asset Management. over time, this may create additional challenges for the Russian economy.” India is a major purchaser of Russian oil, which has been sanctioned by most Western countries because of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war with Ukraine. China buys significantly more Russian oil than India — and unlike India, China hasn't faced additional tariffs for purchasing Russian oil. Indian government officials have defended purchasing Russian oil previously, calling it essential to the country's energy security. And Russian oil has traded at a significant discount – roughly $16 a barrel – to OPEC or US crude, making it hard for India to quit, noted Robert Yawger at Mizuho Securities. Even after this agreement with the United States, Yawger said he expected India may flout sanctions and purchase Russian oil, as it has throughout the past several years. “They'll find a way to go dark fleet and get those barrels moved.” (Dark fleets are ships that use murky tactics to transport oil for pariah states.) But with oil prices coming down, that advantage is not so substantial,” noted Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former chief economic adviser for India's government. “If you throw into the calculus that Indian exporters were suffering from Trump tariffs, it became easier to stop buying Russian oil.” US crude prices were down 5% to about $61 a barrel on Monday, but that was mostly unchanged from before Trump's announcement. “India has been slow-walking these trade talks for months, and the terms here are so vague that they could be anything from major to nothingburger,” said Scott Lincicome, an economist at the Cato Institute. Trump said Indian goods would immediately face an 18% tariff, down from a 50% – a rate that had included an additional 25% tariff Trump put in place in August to persuade India to stop purchasing Russian oil. A White House spokesperson told CNN that Trump will fully remove the additional tariff and reduce the so-called reciprocal tariff. Indian goods had among highest tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration. Because of various exemptions, the effective tariff rate on Indian goods was roughly 35%, according to Subramanian. Although Trump didn't explain which barriers would be removed, those often include special taxes on US companies' services or value-added taxes on goods. Trump may have been eager to cut a deal with India after the European Union signed a long-sought free trade agreement with India last week, noted Subramanian. “If India gives preferential access to the EU, US business is affected,” he said. Although India isn't one of America's largest trading partners, the reduction in tariffs could nevertheless make a meaningful dent: The United States imported $95.5 billion in goods from India in 2025 as of November, 3% of the value of total imported goods, and it exported $42 billion of goods there over that time, according to the US Census Bureau. Among the top goods the US imported from India last year are computers and other electronics, such as phones, pharmaceuticals, apparel and chemicals. Meanwhile, India's top imports from the US were oil, gas, airplanes and airplane parts. Beyond goods, corporate America has grown increasingly reliant on India. Companies including American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and Google have deepened their footprint in India, hiring workers there rather than sponsoring visas to work in the US and even opened new offices there.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A total of 23 converted warehouses could imprison up to 80,000 people, estimates suggest. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. At least seven sites being looked at by the administration could be used to imprison 7,500 people or more, with some sites coming close to a 10,000-person figure. A post from DHS on X claims that the buildings they're purchasing “will not be warehouses — they will be well structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards.” But experts believe it will be difficult to ensure the warehouses meet safety standards before agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and/or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) begin imprisoning people within their walls. Indeed, at least one of the warehouses being considered for purchase is reputed to be dangerous on hot weather days. Meanwhile, “regular detention standards” in facilities already operated by DHS are abusive and inhumane, human rights groups have pointed out. The purchase and conversion of these buildings would be a major escalation of President Donald Trump's already deeply unpopular immigration crackdown, in which federal agents have terrorized communities across the U.S., often abducting people with pending asylum cases or who were set to receive green cards with no regard for their due process rights, and even detaining U.S. citizens. That ban could be challenged — the state legislature, for example, which is controlled by Republicans, could pass a bill nullifying local ordinances seeking to block the administration from buying these warehouses. The White House could also file a lawsuit claiming federal “supremacy clause” arguments. But city leaders say they will not give up without a fight. “I will use every tool at my disposal to fight this federally funded terrorist organization that is ICE,” Kansas City Councilman Jonathan Duncan said after the ordinance was passed. “While today's moratorium vote was a good first step to stopping this mass incarceration concentration camp from being built in our City, this fight is far from over. We will need to put public pressure on any business that thinks they can sell out our community for personal profit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump supporter Júnior Pena falsely claimed migrants being rounded up, including Brazilians, were ‘all crooks' A rightwing Brazilian influencer who claimed Donald Trump's immigration crackdown targeted only “crooks” has been arrested by ICE agents in New Jersey. Júnior Pena, whose full name is Eustáquio da Silva Pena Júnior, declared his support for the US president in a recent video message to his hundreds of thousands of social media followers. In a previous video, Pena reportedly urged Brazilians to stay calm and not “despair” after reports that ICE agents were rounding up migrants, including Brazilians. On Saturday, Pena was himself reportedly detained and sent to the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. One friend told the local newspaper the Brazilian Times that Pena had been taken into custody after missing a court hearing. The US's estimated 2 million-strong Brazilian community has been badly affected by Trump's anti-migrant offensive, with the number of deported Brazilians hitting a record high of 2,785 last year, compared with 1,640 in 2024. In a recent report about the “veritable manhunt” playing out under Trump, the Brazilian magazine Veja warned readers: “There is an atmosphere of fear on the streets where anyone who ‘looks foreign' can be a target … irrespective of their [immigration] status.” The magazine said Brazilian migrants in cities such as Boston were adopting drastic “survival tactics” including not speaking Portuguese in public and trying to dress like “average Americans” when leaving their homes. Friends of the influencer posted messages asking his followers to pray.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian troops are trying to "bypass and infiltrate" the destroyed town of Vovchansk in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, and the situation is "frankly difficult," Viktor Tregubov, a spokesman for Ukraine's Joint Forces in charge of the area, said on Feb. 2. "The city is completely destroyed, there is no infrastructure to serve as a barrier," Tregubov said, as cited by Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform. Vovchansk — just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Russian border — endured Russian occupation until the 2022 autumn Ukrainian counter-offensive liberated the town, only to face heavy fighting again after Russia began a new push in May 2024, forcing many residents to flee their homes. The news follows a deadly Russian drone attack on a bus carrying miners, which killed at least 12 people and injured 16 others on Feb. 1. in the town of Ternivka. The Ukrainian government approved a resolution on Feb. 2 mandating the registration of Starlink terminals to prevent their use by Russian forces, Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced. Under the resolution, Ukraine will introduce a so-called "whitelist" for Starlink terminals, with all unverified devices to be disconnected. Fedorov's statement came days after Ukraine's Defense Ministry reached out to SpaceX, urging the company to prevent Russian drones from using Starlink, as the satellite internet system could help them to operate further over Ukraine. The company responded swiftly, with U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk writing on Feb. 1 that SpaceX's efforts to halt "unauthorized" Russian use of Starlink seemed to have worked. SpaceX's initial steps to stop Russia from using Starlink to control attack drones over Ukraine are already delivering "real results," Fedorov said on Feb. 1. Overnight Ukrainian drone strikes hit two Russian command posts, one regimental and another divisional level, in the Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast, as well as an ammunition depot, according to the General Staff. In another hot spot of the war, down in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian drone strikes hit Russia's drone command posts, the General Staff also claimed. More than 200 buildings in Kyiv remain without heating as temperatures plunge, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 2. Zelensky said that the lack of heating in over 200 buildings is mostly due to the Jan. 31 outage, which authorities said was caused by technical malfunctions amid freezing temperatures. Russia has scaled up its energy blitz in January, targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure with barrages of missiles and drones in an attempt to lower Ukrainians' morale as they try to survive in cold temperatures, often without electricity, heating, or water. A shortage of air defense missiles has left some Ukrainian air defense systems empty at times amid the threat of further Russian attacks, Yurii Ihnat, head of the Air Force's communications department, said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on Feb. 2. With the onset of winter, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in an effort to plunge the country into a nationwide blackout. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air defense forces lack sufficient resources to intercept all Russian missiles and drones. Ihnat said that Ukrainian authorities, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have repeatedly stressed the shortage of missiles for air defense systems, noting that some of them are depleted and not ready to repel Russian attacks. "Indeed, before one such attack, we were provided with the necessary means a day in advance," Ihnat said. "Ukrainian forces repelled that massive strike quite successfully, thanks to missiles for F-16s, NASAMS, IRIS-T, and Patriot." At least 14 people have been killed and 38 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Feb. 2. The Air Force said that Russian forces had attacked Ukraine with a ballistic missile and 171 drones, of which around 100 were Shahed-type drones. In central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a Russian drone hit a bus carrying miners after their shifts near the town of Pavlohrad, killing at least 12 and injuring 16 others on Feb. 1, regional governor Oleksandr Hanzha and DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy firm, reported. DTEK reported on Feb. 2 that Russia carried out another attack on its coal mining company's facility in the region, damaging its administrative buildings. In eastern Donetsk Oblast, regional governor Vadym Filashkin reported that two people were killed and four others were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day. In northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported that a 20-year-old and a 52-year-old woman were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day. In the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia and its surrounding region, 12 people were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, regional governor Ivan Fedorov reported. A Russian drone attack targeted yet another Ukrainian Railways infrastructure, targeting a diesel locomotive, used to generate electricity from diesel fuel, in Zaporizhzhia, the Ministry for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine reported on Feb. 2. In southern Kherson Oblast, three people were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Russia has lost around 1,241,530 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Jan. 29. According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,627 tanks, 23,981 armored fighting vehicles, 76,585 vehicles and fuel tanks, 36,802 artillery systems, 1,633 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,291 air defense systems, 435 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 121,217 drones, 28 ships and boats, and two submarines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian troops are trying to "bypass and infiltrate" the destroyed town of Vovchansk in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, and the situation is "frankly difficult," Viktor Tregubov, a spokesman for Ukraine's Joint Forces in charge of the area, said on Feb. 2. "The city is completely destroyed, there is no infrastructure to serve as a barrier," Tregubov said, as cited by Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform. Vovchansk — just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Russian border — endured Russian occupation until the 2022 autumn Ukrainian counter-offensive liberated the town, only to face heavy fighting again after Russia began a new push in May 2024, forcing many residents to flee their homes. About 80 buildings remain without heating following a Jan. 31 mass outage in Ukraine's energy grid, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported in the evening on Feb. 2. Klitschko said over 3,400 buildings were initially left without heating after the mass outage, which authorities said was caused by technical malfunctions that led to the shutdown of two high-voltage power lines amid freezing temperatures. Russia has intensified its energy blitz in January, targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure with barrages of missiles and drones, in an attempt to lower Ukrainians' morale amid freezing temperatures. "Utility and energy workers are working around the clock to connect buildings to the heat supply," Klitschko said in his Telegram post. Russia attacked an area east of Dnipro city with guided aerial bombs (KAB) and drones, killing a 67-year-old man, according to Hanzha. Two others were wounded in another Russian attack on Nikopol and its neighboring towns, located across the Dnipro River from the Moscow-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Russia struck a coal mine operated by Ukraine's biggest private energy firm, DTEK, in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the company said on Feb. 2. The news follows a deadly Russian drone attack on a bus carrying miners, which killed at least 12 people and injured 16 others on Feb. 1. in the town of Ternivka. The Ukrainian government approved a resolution on Feb. 2 mandating the registration of Starlink terminals to prevent their use by Russian forces, Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced. Under the resolution, Ukraine will introduce a so-called "whitelist" for Starlink terminals, with all unverified devices to be disconnected. The company responded swiftly, with U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk writing on Feb. 1 that SpaceX's efforts to halt "unauthorized" Russian use of Starlink seemed to have worked. SpaceX's initial steps to stop Russia from using Starlink to control attack drones over Ukraine are already delivering "real results," Fedorov said on Feb. 1. Overnight Ukrainian drone strikes hit two Russian command posts, one regimental and another divisional level, in the Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast, as well as an ammunition depot, according to the General Staff. In another hot spot of the war, down in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian drone strikes hit Russia's drone command posts, the General Staff also claimed. More than 200 buildings in Kyiv remain without heating as temperatures plunge, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 2. Zelensky said that the lack of heating in over 200 buildings is mostly due to the Jan. 31 outage, which authorities said was caused by technical malfunctions amid freezing temperatures. Russia has scaled up its energy blitz in January, targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure with barrages of missiles and drones in an attempt to lower Ukrainians' morale as they try to survive in cold temperatures, often without electricity, heating, or water. A shortage of air defense missiles has left some Ukrainian air defense systems empty at times amid the threat of further Russian attacks, Yurii Ihnat, head of the Air Force's communications department, said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on Feb. 2. With the onset of winter, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in an effort to plunge the country into a nationwide blackout. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air defense forces lack sufficient resources to intercept all Russian missiles and drones. Ihnat said that Ukrainian authorities, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have repeatedly stressed the shortage of missiles for air defense systems, noting that some of them are depleted and not ready to repel Russian attacks. "Indeed, before one such attack, we were provided with the necessary means a day in advance," Ihnat said. "Ukrainian forces repelled that massive strike quite successfully, thanks to missiles for F-16s, NASAMS, IRIS-T, and Patriot." At least 14 people have been killed and 38 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Feb. 2. The Air Force said that Russian forces had attacked Ukraine with a ballistic missile and 171 drones, of which around 100 were Shahed-type drones.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A public health crisis is unfolding in Minnesota as people targeted by federal agents are afraid to seek healthcare while some healthcare staff are also fearful for their safety at work. They fear unfamiliar cars idling outside clinics and in hospital parking garages. “They are afraid of being pulled out of their car and taken to the Whipple building and sent on a flight to Texas, even our legal permanent residents, United States citizens. Munira Maalimisaq, founder and CEO of the Inspire Change Clinic in Minneapolis, noted that “even people who are documented are not going to their doctor's appointments. Providers said that there are immediate and long-term health dangers from the federal occupation of Minnesota, including clashes with agents, stress, food insecurity, exacerbation of chronic illness and acute emergencies. “If people aren't getting their medications and they're not getting their treatments, they will die,” said Mary Turner, president of National Nurses United (NNU) and an ICU nurse in the Minneapolis area. Many organizations, including NNU, are calling for the abolition of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “All they've become now is a violent, racist, lawless agency, and you can see that in our streets. And we're saying as a nursing organization: not one more penny goes to ICE,” Turner said. “We are all working very diligently to make sure hospitals are as safe as they possibly can be, and that we can amplify existing systems for alternative care like telehealth and home health and prescription delivery,” said Erin Stevens, a physician in Minneapolis and member with the Committee to Protect Health Care. As patients began canceling appointments or failing to show up at all, Maalimisaq decided to create a rapid response unit at her clinic in December. Doctors began calling Maalimisaq to see whether the rapid response unit could deliver seizure medications and check on pregnant patients. The requests flooded in, but they didn't have enough staff at the clinic, so they put out a call to local providers. More than 150 providers answered: emergency physicians, cardiologists, pediatricians, “everything that you could think of”, Maalimisaq said. They have also partnered with neighborhood organizations on food drives, clothing swaps and transportation for medical visits. “It's a public health crisis because people don't have access to what they typically would, whether it is baby formula, whether it is getting for their mental health visits or picking up prescriptions that they need,” Conley said. Most areas of clinics and hospitals are considered private property, which federal agents need signed judicial warrants to enter. Hospital staff have also been trained on what to do if agents appear. “They're going to places where people are vulnerable,” Conley said of federal agents. These health issues accumulate atop the immediate dangers of the clashes: car crashes, teargas and pepper spray, rubber bullets and actual bullets. Detainees report poor conditions and a lack of adequate medical care. Liam Conejo Ramos, the five-year-old asylum seeker detained in Minneapolis who became ill with fever, vomiting and lethargy, was held until Saturday at Dilley Immigration Processing Center in Texas, where a measles outbreak was detected on Friday. The Department of Homeland Security is auditing at least one hospital's employment records. At Turner's hospital, workers under threat are leaving their contact information and other details – whether they have family members and pets at home – in sealed envelopes with their union representatives. “If they all of a sudden don't show up, their information is sealed somewhere safely,” Turner said. Maalimisaq, who is Somali, says she and her staff “show up” and do the work, but she battles the daily fear that they will be targeted next. “I've never felt this vulnerable,” Maalimisaq said, but added: “There is no way I would ever sit back and not do something because it puts me in harm's way. Their lives would be in danger if we didn't provide the care that they needed.” Many of her patients are not able to speak up for themselves right now, which is why “we as healthcare providers are using our voice, Maalimisaq said. “Healthcare needs to remain safe and accessible for everyone.</p>

But the lethal strikes by U.S. forces on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, which have killed at least 126 people since Sept. 2, have done little to make a dent in Colombia's lucrative cocaine trade. Mr. Trump has described his Colombian counterpart as “an illegal drug dealer” and, after removing Nicolás Maduro from power in Venezuela, he had suggested Mr. Petro could be next. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's most recently published report, potential cocaine production in Colombia in 2023 was 2,664 metric tons. In violence-torn Colombia, fear grows over Trump's threats of military action In Colombia, “people are scared to involve themselves in trafficking and to leave on the speedboats heading toward international markets,” said Javier Florez, director of conflict and security at the Ideas for Peace Foundation, a think tank. However, rather than halting the cocaine trade, Operation Southern Spear, as the U.S. military effort is known, appears to have simply displaced it. In Colombia's Pacific region, from which most U.S.-bound cocaine departs, the country's traffickers are establishing new routes through Ecuador and Peru to reach legal seaports, swapping speedboats for container ships as they adapt to U.S. military threats, said Mr. Florez. Already battling over illegal economies like gold mining, the recent surge in drug trafficking has only intensified their fighting. “Clashes over control of drug trafficking corridors have devastated riverine communities in Venezuela and Colombia, confining or displacing populations and driving targeted killings,” said Bram Ebus, director at Amazon Underworld, an investigative journalism collective, in an interview from Bogota. The Colombian government said it seized 794.5 tons of cocaine in 2024 (up to November).Matias Delacroix/The Associated Press Not only has Washington's boat bombing campaign triggered conflict over new strategic routes, it has acted as a catalyst for violence in drug producing regions by pushing down the price of coca, the plant used to make cocaine. A round of violence broke out in late December in the northeast Catatumbo region between the ELN and Frente 33, a FARC-dissident group, after a year in which levels of violence had stabilized, said Luis Niño, the government's High Peace Adviser for the region. “If [the rebels] want to export [cocaine], it must be via routes not controlled by the U.S. government, and that makes it much more complex,” said Mr. Niño, who is responsible for negotiating with guerrilla groups in Catatumbo. Venezuelans and Colombians in Bogotá tackle three big questions on their post-Maduro future The economic impact on farmers who depend on the coca trade could unleash further humanitarian consequences, and potentially fuel recruitment to armed groups, Mr. Niño said, as struggling farmers grow more desperate and more vulnerable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tensions are running high amid a military buildup by the U.S. Navy near Iran, following a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution. U.S. President Donald Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded Iran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three preconditions for resumption of talks: Zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile program and ending its support for regional proxies. Iran has long rejected all three demands as unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers see the ballistic missile program, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle. A senior Iranian official and a Western diplomat told Reuters that U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi could meet in Turkey in the coming day. A Turkish ruling party official told Reuters that Tehran and Washington had agreed that this week's talks would be focused on diplomacy, a potential reprieve for possible U.S. strikes. For talks to resume, Iran says there should not be preconditions and that it is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU), accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution.” However, he added, for the start of talks, Tehran wants U.S. military assets moved away from Iran. Earlier: U.S. attack on Iran would spark ‘regional war' in Middle East, says Khamenei Recent satellite imagery of two of the targeted sites, Isfahan and Natanz, appear to show some repair work since December, with new roofing over two previously destroyed buildings. Washington-based think tank ISIS said satellite images from late January show construction work on tunnel entrances at Isfahan that could “indicate a preparation for additional military strikes” as was seen ahead of last year's U.S. strikes. After five rounds of talks that have stalled since May, 2023, several hard-to-bridge issues remained between Tehran and Washington, including Iran's insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil and refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium. Since the U.S. strikes on Iran's three nuclear sites in June, Tehran says its uranium enrichment work has stopped. Western countries fear Iran's uranium enrichment could yield material for a warhead. Iran says its nuclear program is only for electricity generation and other civilian uses. The Iranian sources said Tehran could ship its highly enriched uranium abroad and pause enrichment in a deal that should also include lifting economic sanctions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paris is preparing neo-colonial coups d'etat on the African continent and seeking opportunities for "political revenge" in Africa, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service's (SVR) press bureau reported. "France is preparing neo-colonial coups in Africa," the statement said. According to information received by the SVR, "Emmanuel Macron's administration is feverishly seeking opportunities for 'political revenge' in Africa." "Whether inspired by the American operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro or imagining himself as the arbiter of the fate of African peoples, Macron has authorized his special services to launch a plan to eliminate 'undesirable leaders' in Africa," the press bureau pointed out. The SVR also noted that France's involvement in the January 3 attempted coup in Burkina Faso, which was successfully thwarted, has already been established. According to Paris' calculations, this would not only bring pro-French forces to power in Ouagadougou but also deal a blow to all supporters of sovereignty and Pan-African ideology on the continent," the statement said. "The main target of this gang is Mali. Attacks on fuel trucks, attempts to blockade Malian cities, and terrorizing civilians all serve one purpose: creating conditions for the overthrow of President Assimi Goita. "Paris is working on ways to overthrow the country's new president Michael Randrianirina, and to 'restore a loyal regime'," the SVR noted. "In essence, France has moved to directly support various terrorists who are becoming its main allies on the African continent. This makes the political bankruptcy of [Emmanuel] Macron's policy all the more obvious, as he has failed to rid France of its reputation in Africa as a parasitic metropolis that robs its former colonies and hinders their development," the press bureau concluded.</p>

MOSCOW, February 2. /TASS/. Afghanistan is an observer state in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and Kabul considers it appropriate to resume active participation in its work, Afghanistan's Ambassador to Russia, Gul Hassan, said in an interview with TASS.

When asked whether the Afghan side considers it possible to resume cooperation with the SCO, the ambassador answered affirmatively.

"Yes, Afghanistan is an observer state in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and, in accordance with this status, should participate in its meetings," the diplomat said in his first interview as head of the diplomatic mission in Moscow.

Thus, according to the ambassador, thanks to the efforts of Moscow and Beijing, most of the organization's member states "have come to the conclusion that it would be viable to restore Afghanistan's active participation in the SCO's work."

"We also count on Afghanistan's participation in the organization's upcoming meetings," he added.</p>
