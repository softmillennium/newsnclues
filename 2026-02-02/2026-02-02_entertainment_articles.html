It should come as no surprise that Amazon's documentary “Melania,” about First Lady Melania Trump, grossed $7 million at the box office over the weekend, making it the highest opening for a non-music documentary in over a decade. That's not because “Melania” is an exquisitely made, informative documentary. Instead, it falls in the category of glossy advertisement or unconvincing propaganda film with a multimillion-dollar music licensing budget. Amazon MGM Studios paid $40 million for the rights to film. That offer came with a jaw-dropping $35 million marketing budget, which Amazon spent while also cutting 16,000 corporate jobs. Previous examples of documentaries in this category include “Michael Jackson's This Is It,” “With Love, Meghan,” and, most recently, “Victoria Beckham,” a Netflix docuseries. (To be fair, all three of those documentaries were far more revealing than “Melania”; the only thing that one learns about Melania Trump during her 104-minute infomercial is that her favorite song is Michael Jackson's “Billie Jean.”)But the merits of Brett Ratner's “Melania” don't matter. The film is and will continue to be a box office hit because anti-woke, conservative, and faith-based documentaries thrive theatrically. Related Stories Subscribe to Our Craft Newsletter, Top of the Line: This Week, A Last Dance at Sundance ‘Michael' Trailer: What Are We Not Going to See in the King of Pop's Splashy New Biopic? Take Matt Walsh's 2024 “Am I Racist?” — a right-leaning film that tears into diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. That same year, a documentary titled “Vindicating Trump” earned $1.3 million theatrically, which for any documentary these days is a lot of money. Over a decade ago, before the Trump era, conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza's “2016: Obama's America” and “America: Imagine the World Without Her” grossed $33 million and $14 million at the box office, respectively.It's been over 20 years since progressive documentaries were box-office juggernauts. In 2005, Davis Guggenheim's Oscar-winning feature documentary “March of the Penguins,” about global warming, earned $77,437,223 worldwide. That is in stark contrast to the 2025 Oscar-winning feature documentary “No Other Land,” about the occupied Palestinian region of Masafer Yatta, which grossed $3.6 million worldwide. Other recent Oscar-winning documentaries, like “20 Days in Mariupol” and “Navalny,” earned just $35,000 and $107,000 worldwide, respectively.What the documentary industry should be worried about is what the box office success of “Melania” means for filmmakers motivated to make complex nonfiction films with a worldview that disrupt the status quo and have the potential to offend President Trump and his MAGA base. Movies not like “Melania.”Eight years ago, during “the golden age of documentary,” streamers like Amazon made it clear that although they were corporate behemoths, they weren't worried about Trump, who was serving his first term as president. In 2020, Amazon reportedly spent $5 million for global rights to Garrett Bradley's documentary “Time,” about a Louisiana woman's 20-year effort to secure her husband's release from prison. Both “Time” and “I'm Not Your Negro” received Academy Award nominations.But things changed last year when not only Amazon, but also Paramount and Disney, went after the rights to “Melania.” It was a clear and deliberate signal to the documentary industry that they would not offend Donald Trump or his MAGA base with progressive documentaries. Last month at the Sundance Film Festival, documentary filmmakers and producers discovered, according to multiple sources, that Amazon wasn't in the market to acquire and commission any documentaries. Not surprisingly, the company's 2026 budget for nonfiction fare has been used in its entirety to produce and release “Melania.” Not only are traditional buyers like HBO not buying or commissioning as many documentaries as they did a decade ago, but budgets across the board have also been slashed. Then there is tech billionaire Jeff Skoll, the founder and chair of the former socially conscious powerhouse production company Participant Media. Together with the late Diane Weyermann, Skoll produced and helped fund numerous documentaries like “An Inconvenient Truth ” and “RBG” that fed the public's appetite for thought-provoking subject matter. In 2024, Skoll not only closed Participant but also hosted a Donald Trump inauguration victory rally.Currently, the majority of indie documentary filmmakers are relying on an unsustainable self-distribution model and the service-deal marketplace.In Park City, documentary filmmakers, producers, and cinematographers networked, hoping to land a job or at the very least, get a lead on a potential job opportunity. The future of socially minded or politically progressive documentaries is in jeopardy, and there isn't a left-leaning version of Jeff Bezos to swoop down and save the industry. Only so many documentary filmmakers and producers can be hired to make more nonfiction films for streamers about celebrities, cults, and true crime. Celebrated documentary filmmakers and producers are turning to reality television for work. According to Rolling Stone, two-thirds of the crew members who worked on “Melania” requested that their names not be formally credited in the documentary.“I understand if a liberal is working on the movie and they don't want to be credited, but they want to feed their family,” Ratner told Variety. Other streamers like Apple, whose CEO Tim Cook attended the White House premiere of “Melania,” could potentially turn their back on the documentary community and attempt to make current event, politically minded documentaries disappear. Both companies still support social issue films that tackle politics. HBO's “The Alabama Solution,” a hard-hitting exposé of the brutal Alabama state prison system, and Netflix's “The Perfect Neighbor,” a film that takes aim at America's stand-your-ground laws, both received Oscar nominations in the best feature documentary category this year.” Later this year, fingers crossed, HBO will release Alex Gibney's Elon Musk documentary “Musk.”Without timely documentaries that confront power and interrogate the truth, there's a vacuum to be filled with propaganda.

Here's something notable: new marketing materials for Antoine Fuqua‘s long-awaited Michael Jackson film (just “Michael”) are playing up a specific time frame. Phrases like “early solo career” and “this is where his story begins” stand out in both the film's latest trailer and a brand-new poster. On one hand, focusing on a more compact period of time in an iconic artist's life is smart, simply for the sake of running time. Well, considering it stars his own nephew Jaafar Jackson and is leaning so hard into the early stuff, we hazard to guess: quite a bit. Related Stories Former Sundance Head Tabitha Jackson Will Next Lead NYC's Film Forum ‘The Devil Wears Prada 2' Trailer: Meryl Streep Returns as Miranda Priestley in Promising First Look Highlighting both his life off-stage and some of the most iconic performances from his early solo career, the film gives audiences a front-row seat to Michael Jackson as never before. The film also stars Nia Long, Laura Harrier, Juliano Valdi, Miles Teller, and Colman Domingo, all of whom pop in its latest trailer (Domingo and Long, as Michael's conflicted parents, really shine). As IndieWire previously reported, the film has already endured a massive legal snafu involving a big chunk of the movie, which reportedly centered on a child molestation accuser's lawsuit that the Jackson estate was not allowed to depict on film, forced filmmakers to completely reshoot and retool parts of the film, leading to it to be delayed for months indefinitely. Footage from the movie was even confidently teased at CinemaCon back in 2024 but was completely absent this past spring as the movie underwent its reshoots. Lionsgate will release “Michael” in theaters (including IMAX) on Friday, April 24. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Savannah Guthrie was absent from Today on Feb. 2 as she works with local authorities in Arizona to find her mother, Nancy Guthrie, who was last seen on Jan. 31. Nancy is 84 years old and considered a “missing vulnerable adult” due to her age, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department. We thank law enforcement for their hard work on this case and encourage anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff's office at 520-351-4900.” In a news conference held on Feb. 1, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos provided further details about the case. “We don't typically get the sheriff out at a scene like this, but it's very concerning what we're learning from the house. Our homicide team is out right now looking at the scene as well.” Nanos explained to reporters that missing person reports of this kind come in often, but this one stood out specifically due to the description of the scene, which has not been shared with the public. “We do in fact have a crime scene,” he said, noting that there is reason to believe Nancy did not leave home on her own volition. “I need this community to step up and start giving us some calls.” The missing person report shared by the Pima County Sheriff's Department describes Nancy as being 5 feet 5 inches tall with a weight of 150 pounds, brown hair, and blue eyes. Concerns about her well-being were raised after a member of her church contacted a family member when she didn't show up for services. The Guthrie family reported to authorities that Nancy does not suffer from any cognitive issues. “The family wants everyone to know that this isn't someone who just wandered off.” Jelly Roll Says ‘Jesus Is Not Owned by One Political Party‘ in Grammy Speech How One Line in 'Home Alone' Made Catherine O'Hara a Pop-Culture Legend Donald Trump Is Crashing Out Over Trevor Noah's Jeffrey Epstein Joke Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ESPN is valued at about $30 billion, with the National Football League's 10 percent equity stake in the sports media giant securing an estimated fair market value of $3 billion, according to The Walt Disney Co.'s latest quarterly earnings report. The league, meanwhile, has an option to acquire an additional 4 percent of ESPN on a similar timetable, also at 70 percent market value. Disney Beats Wall Street Earnings Estimates as Succession Looms Disney Hires Morgan Stanley Analyst Ben Swinburne to Lead Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy The RedZone channel, meanwhile, will join Disney's linear portfolio, with Disney also planning to merge its ESPN fantasy football product with NFL Media's fantasy product. The NFL will also license games, RedZone, NFL Films programming and other content and rights to ESPN, with the sports media company also securing rights to the RedZone brand to use for other sports. Perhaps most importantly, Disney will be getting the exclusive games that had lived with NFL Network, giving it more inventory. “So the upcoming NFL season, which will end in ESPN first Super Bowl is a huge opportunity for ESPN, not only in terms of its ability to manage the NFL Network and RedZone, but also with more NFL inventory.

Bad Bunny conquered the Grammys last night and is on track to conquer the Super Bowl halftime show stage this coming weekend, so the knights of Westeros and the financial bandits of London have already laid down their swords. HBO has confirmed that instead of trying to compete directly with the Super Bowl, its two major Sunday evening series, Industry and A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms, will become available a little bit early via HBO Max. 

While both episodes will still air linearly on Sunday evening in their regular time slots, the fifth episode of Industry‘s current season and the fourth episode of A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms will debut on HBO Max on Friday, February 6 at 3:01 am ET/12:01 am PT. Adjust your watch parties accordingly! 

HBO pulled a similar move in 2024, sharing that year's episode of True Detective: Night Country on Friday night so people wouldn't have to choose between watching a corpsicle thaw and footage of Taylor Swift and Ice Spice watching the Chiefs best the 49ers. Beside Bad Bunny, the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks will also be at this year's Super Bowl, a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 that presumably won't include Left Shark this time. Kickoff for that is at 6:30 ET.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's wife, Sarah Ferguson, made a crude comment about their daughter Princess Eugenie in an email to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. On Friday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released millions of files related to its criminal investigations into the late child sex offender. “ny [New York]?” Epstein wrote the mom of two, to which she replied, “Not sure yet. Just waiting for Eugenie to come back from a shagging weekend! !” (Shagging is a British slang term for sexual intercourse.) Eugenie, now 35, was two days away from turning 20 when the emails between her mom and Epstein were exchanged. Ferguson also shares daughter Princess Beatrice, 37, with Andrew, 65, who was stripped of his royal titles last October due to his ties to pedophile Epstein. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew,” Buckingham Palace told Page Six in a statement at the time. Meanwhile, Ferguson also faced consequences for her ties to Epstein. Last September, Julia's House, a children's hospice charity, cut ties with the British author after her emailed apology to the child rapist leaked. The Daily Mail revealed at the time that Ferguson reached out to Epstein in April 2011 to “humbly apologize” for calling their friendship a “gigantic error of judgment” in an Evening Standard interview. “I know you feel hellaciously let down by me from what you were either told or read,” she wrote to Epstein. Ferguson then called the convicted sex offender a “steadfast, generous and supreme friend.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The entertainment industry is mourning the loss of beloved actress Catherine O'Hara, who passed away on January 30. O'Hara leaves behind a loving family and an incredible career. Murphy played Alexis Rose on the popular series, “Schitt's Creek,” which ran for six seasons from 2015 until 2020. O'Hara's was her onscreen mother, Moira Rose. Her laugh was a perpetual Yes, And… It challenged anyone who heard it to join in, and be as delighted as she was,” Murphy wrote. “Gosh, were we ever lucky to have her.” She ended her message with the hashtag #goodbyetoagreatactress and a wearing sunglasses emoji. “The sunglasses are because I'm in mourning, David!” a fan shared. RIP Moira Rose,” and “It's hard to put into words the feeling of this loss. Her work was a meaningful part of so many lives. O'Hara and Eugene had a friendship that spanned five decades after first meeting in the ‘70s at the Toronto-based improv troupe, Second City. Both Eugene and Dan have penned beautiful tributes for O'Hara as they mourn her loss and celebrate her brilliance. “What a gift to have gotten to dance in the warm glow of Catherine O'Hara's brilliance for all those years,” Dan wrote on Instagram. “Having spent over fifty years collaborating with my Dad, Catherine was extended family before she ever played my family. My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke and every member of her big, beautiful family.” O'Hara had an incredible career with her most recent work on the series “The Studio” and “The Last of Us,” both of which last aired in May 2025.

Jelly Roll Is Changing His Tune About Talking Current Events: 'Everybody's Going to Hear Exactly What I Have to Say in the Most Loud and Clear Way' In a lengthy post shared on Truth Social late Sunday, Trump criticized the Grammys, the broadcast network CBS, and Noah, after the comedian made a remark referencing Trump and Bill Clinton in connection with Jeffrey Epstein. “CBS is lucky not to have this garbage litter their airwaves any longer.” Trump went on to dispute Noah's comment directly, writing: “Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory statement, have never been accused of being there, not even by the Fake News Media.” The president continued his criticism of Noah's hosting, adding: “The host, Trevor Noah, whoever he may be, is almost as bad as Jimmy Kimmel at the Low Ratings Academy Awards… Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast.” Trump also suggested potential legal action, writing that he would be “sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C., and suing him for plenty$,” before concluding: “Get ready Noah, I'm going to have some fun with you!” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No score yet, be the first to add. The Soft Pink Truth began as a lark and a provocation—an invitation to cut rugs and undercut binaries in one fell swoop. Drew Daniel's debut album under the alias, 2003's Do You Party?, operated on multiple levels: A rejoinder to the (straight, white) seriousness of the experimental dance scene, it slipped funk, rap, and disco into a subversive take on glitch-techno aesthetics. reimagined punk classics from groups like Crass, Minor Threat, and Angry Samoans as insouciant electro-pop bangers, erasing the divide between Daniel's hardcore youth and his electronic adulthood while queering the punk-rock canon. A decade later, Why Do the Heathen Rage? took similar liberties with black metal, gleefully torching underground music's ultimate temple to genre purism. You can trace the influence of artists like Moodymann, Matthew Herbert, and DJ Sprinkles, but Soft Pink Truth's last two albums—2020's Shall We Go On Sinning So That Grace May Increase? and 2022's Is It Going to Get Any Deeper Than This?—are also awash in chamber music, spiritual jazz, free improv, and classical minimalism. Both albums feel like illuminated manuscripts advancing the simplest argument ever made: A better world is possible. No score yet, be the first to add. A doubtful undertone creeps into his new album, Can Such Delightful Times Go On Forever? Sinning was expressly framed as a response to Donald Trump's first term as president, a kind of “We Shall Overcome” rooted in the chosen family that Daniel and M.C. Like those albums, the new one favors human players over machines, but it goes a step further, largely abandoning overtly electronic tropes in favor of an acoustic palette informed by chamber music and film composition. It's a side of Daniel that we've rarely heard. “Mere Survival Is Not Enough” launches the album on an unabashedly sentimental note, romantic strings cresting in waves before falling away to reveal a plucky melody that would suit the opening credits of an HBO dramedy. The dimensions are always shifting, acoustic elements smeared into synthetic arrays and back again. It sounds like a tribute to the sounds that Daniel absorbed in the art-house movie theater that his stepfather operated in Louisville, Kentucky. Nearly two dozen players populate the credits, but it's not clear who does what on any given track; by design, the Soft Pink Truth's music subsumes individual voices into a tonal and textural union of broad, swirling shapes. But the emphasis on acoustic timbres also gives this album a more stripped-back feel than its predecessors. But the new album does have plenty of buoyant moments—“Orchard,” featuring pastoral acoustic guitar from Bill Orcutt, is a particular highlight, approximating some of the starry-eyed sensory overload of Jim O'Rourke's Bad Timing and Eureka. And in any case, unalloyed pleasure doesn't seem to be the chief concern of this album. feels like an attempt to break out of his comfort zone at a time when there are no easy answers.

After thanking his wife, Bunnie Xo — “I'd have killed myself if it wasn't for you and Jesus” — Jelly Roll recounted his time in prison, in a “6 by 8 foot cell,” and how those dire days informed Beautifully Broken. That's why I wrote this album,” he said onstage. Then the man born Jason DeFord went into the proselytizing that has become a signature of his concerts and onstage appearances. “I believed that music had the power to change my life and God had the power to change my life,” he shouted. Jelly Roll faced off against fellow nominees Kelsea Ballerini (Patterns), Tyler Childers (Snipe Hunter), Eric Church (Evangeline vs. the Machine), and Miranda Lambert (Postcards From Texas).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justin Bieber back made a triumphant return to the awards show circuit, hitting the Grammys 2026 red carpet with wife Hailey Bieber. The pop star, 31, opted for an oversized black Balenciaga suit paired with a dazzling diamond tennis necklace by Lorraine Schwartz featuring 100 carats of diamonds. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bieber coordinated with her husband in a strapless black Alaïa dress featuring large sheer panels on her legs. The model accessorized with massive diamonds, too, including a silver collar necklace with a 30-carat pear-shaped diamond, matching 20-carat earrings and a 12-carat ring — all also by Schwartz. The couple also made a statement with their accessories, wearing anti-ICE pins reading “ICE OUT.” (They're not the only stars sporting political pins for the award show, as many others including Kehlani wore the same button on the red carpet, in addition to boldly condemning Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in an interview.) Bieber is anticipated to have a big night as he's nominated for four awards — including album of the year for “Swag,” up against Lady Gaga, Bad Bunny, Kendrick Lamar, Sabrina Carpenter and more. He's also set to take the stage for his first major performance in four years. It's sure to be a big year for Bieber, who is set to headline Coachella in April alongside Sabrina Carpenter, Karol G and Anyma. While the Biebers have had marriage struggles in recent times — which Justin sings about on his albums “Swag” and “Swag II” in songs like “Daisies” and “Walking Away” — sources say Hailey was the “driving force” behind his decision to perform at the music festival. We're sure she'll be hyping him up during his performance, too.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Longtime Hallmark star Marcus Rosner just landed his biggest role yet: DAD! On February 1, 2026, the Canadian actor and producer announced the surprise news via social media with his wife, Ali Kroeker, thrilling fans and colleagues. Rosner, who joined the cast of “Sullivan's Crossing” in 2025, has been married to Kroeker, an independent filmmaker, for four years. “The Love Club” star, 36, shared their baby announcement in his Instagram Stories and sweetly wrote, “Welcome, my boy. The photo Rosner and Kroeker shared reveals a tattoo on his hand that says “Be Here Now.” Several months before his son's birth, in October, he shared in a social media video that he'd been reflecting on wanting to be more intentional about telling stories that matter to him, like the fact he was “born to a 15-year-old mother” and didn't grow up with “soft problems” like many of his characters have had. Noting that he's been “very fortunate” to appear in many TV shows and movies, Rosner said, “Recently, something's just been growing in me where I have this feeling that I haven't really used this craft to tell my stories — the ones that shaped me, the ones that might make me feel understood. Rosner continued, “It was thrilling, and I was addicted to that cycle, and I was grateful for it, but lately I've been slowing down and taking the time to make things that might actually last, even if they only matter to me.” The surprise baby news thrilled Rosner's famous friends, including Erin Krakow, whom he's known since playing Charles Kensington on “When Calls The Heart” in 2015.
