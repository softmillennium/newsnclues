                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although the USMNT's most important player, Christian Pulisic has yet to rekindle his early season form with AC Milan, others have shown immense progress as the American player pool develops through the 2025–26 campaign. The latest week saw plenty of Americans stand out in the final week of the Champions League league phase, as well as in their domestic leagues, while MLS players continued to approach their upcoming campaigns with ongoing preseason camps across Europe, South America and the U.S. This weekend saw him score his fifth goal of the season in Venezia's 2–1 win over Carrarese in Serie B action as he continues a strong campaign. A former Sporting Kansas City starlet, Busio is in the final five months of his contract with the Italian side. The presumed starting striker for the USMNT this summer, Folarin Balogun had a heavy week with a scoreless draw against Weston McKennie's Juventus in the Champions League, followed by a 4–0 win over Rennes in Ligue 1 action. While he struggled to make a significant impact in the Champions League, he helped set up two goals against Rennes, picking up an assist on Ansu Fati's opening strike in the 33rd minute. Although he wasn't extremely present in front of the goal, his ability to drop deeper and set up each of Fati and fellow winger, Aleksandr Golovin showed his adaptability as a playmaker in a central attacking role. Malik Tillman's return to the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen has had its ups and downs this season, but he had an outstanding week, scoring three goals across two matches. Both matches saw him play as a right-sided attacking midfielder, where he made late runs into the box and quick linkups with a mix of attacking partners, including Ibrahim Maza and Patrik Schick against Villarreal, and Martin Terrier and Christian Kofane against Frankfurt. While he likely won't maintain scoring more than a goal per game, the uptick in attacking form will be welcome news for Pochettino, with the USMNT looking to bolster further attacking midfield options alongside Christian Pulisic, who has started to slow down with Milan. Weston McKennie was at it again for @juventusfc on Sunday! Weston McKennie still doesn't have a contract beyond 2026 with Juventus, but given how he has played, that seems bound to change. This week, the 27-year-old star continued to showcase his stellar form with his third goal of the Serie A season in a 4–1 win over Parma, following up a strong showing in a scoreless draw against Monaco to advance in the Champions League. The performance saw him continue to make the most of a flourishing partnership with fellow North American Jonathan David, while mustering two chances created and three shots. David, meanwhile, found his fourth goal and third assist in the last seven matches. McKennie's versatility and continued standout play can only be good news for everyone involved. For Juventus, their hopes of Champions League play in 2026–27 continued, while McKennie made his case for a new contract. As for the USMNT, he'll hope to bring that form into March and to the World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Milan have opted to walk away after medical checks revealed a knee problem. Mateta was close to moving to Milan, with the Serie A club reaching a preliminary agreement with Palace over the weekend. That came as something of a hijack, as Nottingham Forest had also been attempting to sign the France international. Now, though, the deal has fallen through, per Sky, with Milan opting against continuing after running medical checks on the striker. He said: "It is nothing to do right now with the transfers. That is why he will not travel with us to Nottingham.” We need every single player at their best and JP [Mateta] isn't at his best right now with all the noise that happens. "It can be football noise, but if someone has private issues where they can't focus on football, then it makes no sense to play. He can't help the team and perform at his top level. We decided it is better not to play him." Mateta has been playing regularly for Palace this season and has made 23 Premier League appearances, scoring eight goals. He played 85 minutes against Chelsea in the fixture prior to the most recent weekend, but Sacha Tavolieri reports that Mateta's medical showed up an issue that will require surgery to fix, and could lead to the striker being out for as many as four months. Palace have also been linked with Jorgen Strand Larsen of Wolves, and have bid for the striker, but it is unclear if his future will be affected by the collapse of Mateta's move.

Mateta has revealed his dream of playing in the World Cup, which may well see him put off surgery until after the tournament. He told Palace's website: “I'm very proud of myself. I will do everything to go there. Mateta has also credited Oliver Glasner with his transformation, adding: “I think it's on him. He used to train in Germany, and when he came in, [in terms of] how we need to play I think I understood, because I'm from the German league too. “I think it's not only me personally, but we have a fantastic team that believes in everyone. We're just training very hard and believing in ourselves, and on the pitch we've had the results.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 05: Gianni Infantino, President of FIFA, speaks during the FIFA World Cup 2026 Official Draw at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on December 05, 2025 in Washington, DC. FIFA President Gianni Infantino has spoken out against banning Russia and Israel from international football — and also defended awarding U.S. President Donald Trump the FIFA Peace Prize in December. There have been calls for FIFA and UEFA to impose a similar ban on Israel because of the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the country's support of settlements in Palestinian territories. Although Russia's ban is yet to be lifted, Infantino claimed it “has not achieved anything” and revealed he will be looking at removing the ban, as well as potentially changing FIFA's statutes to prevent similar sanctions in the future. Infantino was speaking in an hour-long, in-person interview with Yalda Hakim, host of The World on Sky News, which was released online on Monday afternoon. In October, Amnesty International, the global human rights organisation, wrote an open letter to FIFA and UEFA to “suspend the Israeli Football Association until clubs from settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are removed from its leagues”. The letter also argued that “football cannot be separated from Israel's unlawful occupation”, although Infantino told Sky News that implementing a ban on Israel “is a defeat”. “Whatever we can do to help peace in the world, we should be doing it, and for this reason, for some time we were thinking about (whether) we should do something to reward people who do something,” Infantino said of the award, before insisting that “objectively, he (Trump) deserves it”. He was instrumental in resolving conflicts and saving thousands of lives.” Corina Machado, the leader of the opposition in Venezuela, presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Trump during a meeting at the White House on Jan. 15, saying it was “a recognition for his unique commitment (to) our freedom”. Corina Machado's visit to Washington came weeks after Trump ordered U.S. forces to seize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro his wife, Cilia Flores, in a military operation in Caracas. The FIFA president dismissed that narrative and said nobody has suggested cutting diplomatic ties with the United States, essentially asking why football should be treated differently. “I think, in our divided world, in our aggressive world, we need occasions where people can come, can meet around the passion (for football).” Dan Sheldon  is a football news correspondent for The Athletic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bass is set to deliver a State of the City address Monday to outline her administration's priorities for the year ahead — and beyond. SoFi Stadium is set to host several matches, including two U.S. Men's National Team group stage outings, two Round of 32 matchups and a quarterfinal showdown. The World Cup final is set for July 19 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, just outside New York City. In 2027, Super Bowl LXI will be hosted at SoFi. California union believes Waymos should be off the streets Mayor Bass has promised a “car-free Olympics,” although some Angelenos are skeptical of how attainable that goal is. Bass is set to give her State of the City address on Wednesday afternoon at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Another speech is planned for mid-April; this address, according to the L.A. Times, will be more of a traditional State of the City address and focus heavily on the mayor's budget and spending priorities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With less than six months until kickoff, Guardian readers share their experiences of buying World Cup tickets – or deciding not to Fifa's ticketing process has been met with demand and controversy. Security concerns for fans traveling to the US have risen. These are some of the stories we received. When President Trump placed aggressive tariffs on Canadian exports, I completely swore off travel to the United States. So, when Fifa selected me during the “Domestic Exclusivity” phase, I leapt at the opportunity to buy tickets to a match in Canada. Each step of the online process was somewhat confusing, including a counter-clockwise circular countdown with imperceptibly slow movement and multiple login requests. Nevertheless, after a 90-minute wait, I was able to purchase tickets for my family to Canada's last group game. There are tickets at that price and above for every NFL or NHL game. I now live in Australia, and being conscious of the fact that I'd be receiving a decent tax rebate from the Aussie government, had decided to spend that on flying me and the missus to the World Cup taking in some games in the US and Mexico and was registered for tickets and a rough itinerary planned. I've basically decided that not a cent of my money will go to making the tournament a success for either of those odious pricks. I am expecting that the majority of my tickets will be taken by friends and family traveling from the UK – I only intend to attend two to three games personally. I think it is crazy to spend $500 per ticket for a football game, especially given so many of the group games will be between countries that would not have qualified for a 32-team World Cup. However, with games “local” to me, it still feels more accessible than 2030 or 2034. I attended the World Cup in 2010 and spent £800 on tickets in total, including the quarter-final, semi-final and final. I went to Brazil 2014 (but was only able to get tickets for one game) and Russia 2018, but skipped 2022. Prices for 2026 are out of control but the risk of waiting in the hope ticket prices crash (as they did for the Club World Cup) closer to the time was not a risk I was willing to take. I bought four tickets for a group game in Philadelphia. I wanted tickets for a New York game as it's closer to me but the Category 3 & 4 tickets were not available and the Category 2 tickets were too expensive. I ended up paying $155 each for four tickets. It's a big outlay but unfortunately any event in the States is just going to be expensive. Obviously the situation with ICE is worrying. I work in construction so I've met a lot of Colombian & Ecuadorean people who would love to go to these games but, can they be sure they will be not be hassled going to game even if they are in the USA legitimately? Will fans from those countries want to travel even though they are some of the teams who have bought the most color to recent World Cups? And that's before you get to the question of cost. It's also, in my opinion, the best sporting event and only comes around twice a decade. Yes, there were obstacles, but all challenges in life are opportunities. Miami is absolutely not ready for a World Cup. The city has no real public transportation, the roads are a mess on a normal day, and the infrastructure is nowhere near capable of handling an event of this scale. Fifa is a corrupt organization that has never cared about fans or human rights – only profit. It's hard to celebrate a global event when basic safety and dignity are on the line. Living in Toronto, it's been a life's dream for me to attend a World Cup match and I was very excited with the prospect of a World Cup happening in the US, Canada and Mexico. It is quite evident that the current dispensation does not want outsiders in the country – more so, outsiders who look like me (brown and Indian). At this current stage, I don't think I will take the risk of going to the US to watch a match. That leaves very few matches to be held in Toronto. I have signed up for all the Fifa draws so far, waiting in queue for hours only to be told that I have been ‘entered' in a draw. Till now, I have not heard any positive news. I would love to watch a football World Cup match – any match, honestly – and I understand that it may not be cheap which is why I've started trying from so early. I bought my World Cup 2026 tickets during the Early Visa Draw. In total I've spent over $7,000 so far. The prices in general were quite high, but I still wanted to secure the games I cared about. Even with all the difficulties, I'm really excited. I'll be in the US for my summer holiday, and I can't wait to attend the matches in New York and Miami. For me, this feels like a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Even though travel would be very easy for me as an American citizen, and both of my sisters live in host cities (NYC and Dallas), so lodging wouldn't be an issue. And it's really upsetting, because I have a five-year-old son and this should be a core memory for him. Although, I wouldn't completely rule out one of the Mexican venues next summer … Alex, Montana We did manage to get extremely lucky that our credit card company (Wells Fargo) had a draw so we had about 15-20 devices trying to login and my husband got us four tickets for the round of 16 in Houston for $2,000. We're still trying to get tickets for the Kansas City quarter-final as it's the closest game to where we live (a 10-hour drive). I naively thought getting at least one pair of World Cup tickets would be as manageable as getting tickets for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. Surely, I thought, If I could manage to figure out the IOC's ticketing system and attended a ton of Olympic events with face value tickets, then surely purchasing one pair of tickets to a local World Cup would be somewhat achievable. I applied for every single ticketing opportunity and failed each time. I admit the frustration of being unable to attend a local World Cup game has dampened my enthusiasm for the event a bit. I still haven't given up hope and have joined every available promotional contest and event to try to get a pair of those tickets. And I have also been keeping an eye on the secondary market in case some fair priced tickets magically pop up. I'll be perfectly happy to enjoy the World Cup in the comfort of my home, at my local sports bar, or at a neighborhood watch party – the places where all the real local fans will be this World Cup. We spent $800 for four tickets, and plan to buy two more (for which we have budgeted another $800). So when my mother-in-law was drawn for one of the pre-sale right-to-buy contests, we bought tickets right away. We needed tickets on [26 June], since that was the date we were all able to get off work and school. It is exciting to get to see Mo Salah play in person, but I would be lying if I wasn't a bit disappointed to not get France or Brazil, or another “bigger” footballing country. With all of that said, we still think it will be worth it – seeing high-level football like the World Cup is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for football fans in a non-footballing country like the US. I completely understand why my fellow American soccer fans are willing to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to see games. For Qatar 2022 I wasn't well enough and I wasn't too keen on the chosen location for the World Cup. I was organised, I booked accommodation two years in advance to be in New York over the final. Everything was in place, we just needed tickets. We knew these would be expensive and have managed to save about $1,000AUD each for final tickets. We'd probably even go to $1,200AUD each if we had to and we based these estimations on the last final in Qatar with the cheapest final tickets there being $900AUD. Then [in December], the prices came out. Cheapest ticket for the final is roughly $6,250AUD each. We don't have that kind of money. What was a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, a dream after years of illness and not being able to work has been squashed by Fifa's insistence of making as much money as possible, of Infantino's disregard for the real football fan that puts their entire life savings at risk. But we won't be going to the final I've dreamt of purely because Fifa and Infantino need to make more money on top of all the money they already have. I'm frustrated about how Fifa is handling their ticket offerings for those who use a wheelchair. [Regarding hospitality seats] I asked On Location whether I could buy a wheelchair seat [space], and they said I had to buy a regular seat, then call them and let them know I wanted a wheelchair space, and they would try to accommodate. But their email specifically said, “please note, while we will do our best to accommodate your request, this is not a guarantee.” So I have to spend $2,000-$5,000 on a ticket, and they can't even guarantee that I can use it. (I am unlikely to buy Hospitality seats because of the cost, but I'm still disappointed that the option doesn't exist for those with accessibility needs.) Their response was “Unfortunately we do not handle this. After you buy your ticket you should address to Fifa Ticketing direct in order for them to assist you.” So once again, I'd have to spend a lot of money up front, with no guarantee that I'll get a usable seat. In both cases companion seats (a regular seat next to the wheelchair space) were all gone early. By the time my purchasing time slot came up, there were still wheelchair spaces available for many of the games, but no companion seats. I think that's because Fifa lets you buy up to three companion seats for each wheelchair seat. By letting early buyers get three companion seats, those seats run out by the time later buyers get online, forcing wheelchair users to attend games on their own. They finally responded that I should just purchase two wheelchair seats: one for the wheelchair user, and one for the companion. I have no idea if this strategy will work, but that's what I've done for the upcoming Random Selection Draw.</p>

KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) Embassy in Jamaica is inviting applications from locals wishing to attend the upcoming 2026 World Cup.

In a post on X, the embassy said the US is prepared to welcome visitors from around the world to the greatest FIFA World Cup 2026 in history.

“Be a part of history and apply for your US visa today! All visa applicants need to meet all eligibility requirements under US law,” the embassy said.

The World Cup will be held in a cross-continent showing, in Mexico, Canada and the United States. Record ticket requests have already been generated for the event

Some social media users have expressed uncertainty online about attending US matches, citing an ongoing immigration crackdown in the country, while multiple football executives including former FIFA president Sepp Blatter have supported a proposed fan boycott.

Tensions have been heightened by US President Donald Trump's repeated comments about anexxing Greenland.

Trump on the other hand has expressed confidence that this World Cup will be the best in history.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sport in the United States is dominated by a handful of major leagues that shape culture, media coverage and commercial investment. American football, basketball and baseball have long defined the sporting landscape, while ice hockey maintains a strong presence. The National Football League dominates television ratings, sponsorship, sports betting and cultural relevance. The NBA's star-driven appeal, fast-paced action and global reach have made it a favourite among younger audiences. Icons such as LeBron James and Stephen Curry transcend sport, while the league's strong presence on social media has helped basketball remain culturally relevant in an increasingly digital era. Often referred to as America's pastime, baseball retains a deep emotional and historical connection with fans. Major League Baseball continues to draw large crowds during its long season, and its slower pace appeals to purists who value tradition and statistics. Ice hockey, led by the National Hockey League, enjoys passionate followings in colder regions and traditional markets such as Canada and the northern United States. Meanwhile, motorsports, golf and college athletics also command significant attention, particularly during major events. However, these sports tend to exist in specific niches rather than dominating the national conversation. Football currently sits outside the traditional “big three,” but its trajectory is unmistakably upward. Major League Soccer has expanded rapidly, youth participation continues to grow, and European leagues attract millions of American viewers each weekend. High-profile players choosing the US as a destination have further boosted visibility, while internationally tournaments now attract mainstream media coverage. The upcoming FIFA World Cup represents a pivotal moment for football in America. Hosting matches on home soil brings unprecedented exposure, new fans and increased commercial interest. While it may not overtake American football anytime soon, the tournament could make the moment football firmly claims its place among America's elite sporting passions. For American audiences, the World Cup may ultimately redefine football's standing and accelerate its evolution into a mainstream sport.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix is gearing up to tell one of the most important sports stories ever put on screen, and it's found its lead. Zoey Deutch has officially signed on to star in The 99'ers, a new U.S. Women's Soccer drama headed to the streamer and directed by Emmy winner Nicole Kassell. That event didn't just crown champions, it shattered attendance records, dominated TV ratings, and changed how the world viewed women's sports. It's a big role with real weight behind it, and Deutch feels like a smart choice to anchor the story. This project also marks another reunion between Deutch and Netflix. She recently starred as Jean Seberg in Richard Linklater's Nouvelle Vague, which earned her an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Performance. She's also appeared in Set It Up opposite Glen Powell and has the upcoming rom-com Voicemails for Isabelle on the way. People We Meet on Vacation star Emily Bader is also part of the cast, stepping into the cleats of soccer icon Mia Hamm. The screenplay comes from a stacked group of writers including Katie Lovejoy, Dana Stevens, and Peter Hedges, with Jill Mazursky and Jamee Decio credited as the first writers on the project. She was recently in Park City supporting Celebrity Sex Pass, a Sundance comedy directed by David Wain, where she stars alongside Jon Hamm and John Slattery. The 99'ers isn't just about winning a championship. It's about visibility, belief, and a group of women who forced the sports world to pay attention. With Deutch leading the charge and Kassell at the helm, this Netflix film has a real shot at doing justice to a story that still hits hard decades later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An English team also won the first edition of the expanded men's Club World Cup last summer, when Chelsea picked up $100 million. Renée Slegers' side defeated South American champions Corinthians 3–2 after extra time at the Emirates Stadium, landing a £1.7 million winners' cheque as FIFA's new six-team tournament made its debut in the international calendar. The Champions League holders made a fast start at their home ground in north London, with record signing Olivia Smith opening the scoring after 15 minutes. Corinthians responded quickly through captain Gabi Zanotti, who equalised six minutes later, leaving the match finely balanced at the break. Arsenal regained control in the second half when England defender Lotte Wubben-Moy headed home to restore the lead, and the hosts appeared to be in cruise control until a 96th-minute penalty allowed the Brazilian side to force extra time, threatening to spoil Arsenal's night. The closing stages were not without concern for the hosts, with goalkeeper Anneke Borbe stretchered off following a collision with teammate Wubben-Moy, slightly tempering the celebrations at full time. Captain Kim Little praised her side's composure under pressure. “It's great to get the win,” she said. “We showed incredible character and resilience to lose the goal right at the end and come back in extra time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Three Lions have blocked out bookings at The Inn at Meadowbrook, a boutique facility on the grounds of a former country club which can come in at less than £200 per one-night stay. However, there is no longer a golf course, which may disappoint the likes of Kane, who is said to play off three. There are a host of championship courses within driving distance. Thomas Tuchel may wish to gather his squad for lakeside chats at the picturesque complex near Kansas City Prices in Kansas City tend to be lower than in major coastal centres and the hotel has a sterling reputation, boasting a 4.9 rating out of five on the TripAdvisor website, with guests hailing its luxurious touches. One solitary visitor delivered a one-star rating, complaining that there was no reading light in their superior room. England will play their group matches in Dallas, New York and Boston and have chosen Kansas City thanks to its relatively central location. England decided to find a base rather than city-hop after consulting with senior players. At previous tournaments, pictures of loved ones and families have been placed into rooms while, as Daily Mail Sport revealed, a comforting scent has been pumped into public areas. Newcastle United's Anthony Gordon may be interested to hear that the Inn has a series of trails and ‘Cruiser' bikes to hire. Tuchel himself may well be housed in the ‘Grand Suite', which features dining for eight, a fireplace and a banquette that overlooks tiered lakes. The suite also features a soaking tub and powder room. England will bring their own chefs, but in normal circumstances guests can head to American restaurant Verbena, which offers a number of tasty-looking, calorific desserts including fried apple pie, a banana croissant and bread pudding with rum caramel and a malted white chocolate mousse with candied pumpkin seed crumble, pumpkin bread crouton and pomegranate. Fittingly the hotel bills itself as styled like 'an English cottage' full of 'contemporary charm' The publication of Deloitte's Money League raised some eyebrows, not least because it placed Manchester United eighth in the list – their lowest ever position – and below the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal. While Deloitte focus on revenue (with United's recent numbers taking a hit thanks to under-performance on the field and a lack of Champions League football), Forbes concentrates more on the long-term value of the business. In attempting to justify the astronomical prices for World Cup tickets FIFA have quietly pointed out that different rules apply when it comes to the US market. A look at next weekend's Super Bowl would appear to support that point. The cheapest nosebleed seat to see the New England Patriots take on Seattle Seattle Seahawks comes in at close to £4,500 on resale sites. If you want one of the best views at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara on Sunday night then you are looking at around £31,000 for a lower bowl seat which does not include any corporate hospitality. Paris Saint-Germain's assault on London is continuing with the arrival of what officials are calling ‘an experiential laboratory' in Cavendish Square.The French giants opened a store on Oxford Street back in 2023 and will later this month unveil ‘La Maison', which the club say will ‘deliver unique experiences at the crossroads of sport, culture and Parisian lifestyle'. DJs and musicians will perform on the second floor while the third will feature a tasting room and private dining. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.
