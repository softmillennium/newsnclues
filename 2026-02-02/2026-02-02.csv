            Lawyers representing victims of Jeffrey Epstein are asking judges to force the Justice Department to take down the millions of Epstein-related documents it has posted online, saying in a letter dated Sunday that the failure to properly redact victims' information has triggered an “unfolding emergency.”
    


            The letter, written by prominent Epstein victims' lawyers Brittany Henderson and Brad Edwards and addressed to two federal judges in New York who are overseeing Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's cases, requests an “immediate judicial intervention” to address the fact that victims' information was included in the millions of Epstein-related records that were released.
    


            Henderson told CNN that the letter was sent to the judges. The letter is not yet available on the public court docket.
    


            “Within the past 48 hours, the undersigned alone has reported thousands of redaction failures on behalf of nearly 100 individual survivors whose lives have been turned upside down by DOJ's latest release,” Henderson and Edwards wrote to judges Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer.
    


            “There is no conceivable degree of institutional incompetence sufficient to explain the scale, consistency, and persistence of the failures that occurred —particularly where the sole task ordered by the Court and repeatedly emphasized by DOJ was simple: redact known victim names before publication,” they also wrote.
    


New document dump does little to answer Epstein questions or the pain of survivors



            The lawyers list numerous examples of redaction errors that they've come across, such as one minor victim's name allegedly being “revealed 20 times in a single document.” Once those mistakes were reported to the Justice Department, the department only fixed three of the errors, “leaving 17 instances still unpredicted as of this filing,” the lawyers wrote.
    


            Other examples included one email that allegedly lists 32 underage victims “with only one name redacted and 31 left visible,” as well as FBI “302” forms with full first and last names of victims unredacted.
    


            The Justice Department said in a response filed to judges in both cases Monday that it has removed all documents that victims or their lawyers identified.
    


            “As of the writing of this letter, all documents requested by victims or counsel to be removed by yesterday evening have been removed for further redaction, and the Department is continuing to process any new requests and to run its own searches to identify any other documents that may require further redaction,” DOJ said.
    


            CNN reported on Friday that multiple survivors, including anonymous “Jane Doe” victims, were seeing their names and information throughout the files that were published.
    


            Sunday's letter also includes testimony from various anonymous “Jane Doe” victims who described receiving death threats and harassment from the media since the publication of the files.
    


            One Jane Doe is quoted as saying: “The release of this information is not only profoundly distressing and retraumatizing, but it also places me and my child at potential physical risk.”
    


            “DOJ cannot plausibly characterize this as error, negligence, or bureaucratic failure. The task was straightforward: take the list of known victims and redact those names everywhere they appear,” the lawyers wrote. “When DOJ believed it was ready to publish, it needed only to type each victim's name into its own search function. Any resulting hit should have been redacted before publication. Had DOJ done that, the harm would have been avoided”
    


            In a separate statement to CNN, Henderson said: “With every second that passes, additional harm is being caused to these women. They are scared, they are devastated, and they are begging for our government to protect them from further harm.”
    


            A Department of Justice spokesperson previously told CNN that it takes victim protection “very seriously” and has redacted thousands of victims'  names in the published records, with 500 reviewers looking at the files “for this very reason.”
    


“When a victim's name is alleged to be unredacted, our team is working around the clock to fix the issue and republish appropriately redacted pages as soon as possible,” the Justice Department said. “To date, 0.1% of released pages have been found to have victim identifying information unredacted.”

Russia's offer to extend the last major nuclear arms agreement with the US, the New START treaty, for one more year remains valid, former President Dmitry Medvedev has stated. The agreement is set to expire later this week. 

Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, told reporters on Monday that Moscow's proposal “remains on the table, and the treaty has not even expired yet, and if the American side wants to extend it, then this can be done.”

He warned that if the New START treaty lapses later this week, it would mark the first time since 1972 that there are no legal limitations on strategic weapons between the two nuclear powers.

The treaty, signed by Medvedev and then-US President Barack Obama in 2010, caps each side at 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a one-year extension of its core limits last September, but the Kremlin has repeatedly stated it has received no substantive response from the US.

Last week, Medvedev framed the potential collapse of the treaty as a dangerous turning point. In an interview with Kommersant, he stated that “the world could enter a dangerous new phase of uncertainty” and warned that more countries are likely to pursue nuclear weapons due to global instability, viewing them as the only proven guarantor of sovereignty.

Medvedev's warning comes as the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists recently moved its symbolic ‘Doomsday Clock' forward to 85 seconds to midnight. The scientists cited the impending expiration of New START and a “full-blown arms race” as key reasons, urging Russia and the US to resume dialogue.

German politician Sahra Wagenknecht has condemned growing calls for her country to take part in nuclear rearmament, calling the proposals “madness.”



Germany is prohibited from developing nuclear weapons under international law, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Two Plus Four Treaty, the 1990 agreement that enabled German reunification in return for limits on its military capabilities, including renouncing nuclear arms.



Earlier this month, Kay Gottschalk, the parliamentary finance policy spokesman for Alternative for Germany (AfD), said that Berlin “needs nuclear weapons,” arguing that Europe can no longer rely on US protection.



In a post on X on Sunday, Wagenknecht, who previously served in the Bundestag and founded the Bundnis Sahra Wagenknecht party, said that “the cross-front for the nuclear rearmament of Germany is growing.”

“Following advances by AfD politicians for a German nuclear weapon, CDU warmonger Roderich Kiesewetter and former Green foreign minister Joschka Fischer are now also calling for Germany's participation in a European atomic bomb. What madness,” she wrote.



Fischer said last week that Europe must pursue nuclear rearmament, with Germany taking the lead. Kiesewetter proposed in turn that Berlin could instead “contribute financially” to a European nuclear umbrella that Finland, Sweden, and Poland are planning to develop.



Wagenknecht argued that Germany's proposed acquisition of nuclear weapons would constitute a serious violation of Berlin's international legal obligations and would undermine the global system of nuclear arms control. She also warned that US intermediate-range missiles planned for deployment in the Federal Republic, which are capable of striking targets deep inside Russian territory, pose a major security risk.



“The missile deployment undermines the nuclear balance between the US and Russia and massively increases the danger for Germany to become the target of a nuclear strike in the event of conflict,” she wrote.



Instead, Wagenknecht called for Germany to lead a diplomatic disarmament initiative and demanded the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from German territory. “US atomic bombs out! No US intermediate-range missiles in Germany!” she added.

India has earmarked $85 billion for military spending in its budget for the 2026-27 fiscal year, marking a record 15% increase, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has told parliament in her annual budget speech.

The sharp rise follows a brief military conflict with neighboring Pakistan in May 2025. Capital expenditure for the armed forces has been set at $23 billion, aimed at funding major procurement programs.

“The Union Budget 2026-27 will help in further strengthening India's defence capabilities,” Defense Minister Rajnath Singh later said in a post on X.

The key focus of the budget following Operation Sindoor, a limited military operation launched in response to cross-border hostilities with Pakistan earlier this year, is the modernization of the armed forces, Singh said.

New Delhi and Islamabad traded fire from May 7 to 10, following a militant attack on April 22 in Jammu and Kashmir that killed 26 people.

The clashes involved the extensive use of missile systems, underscoring the growing role of long-range strike capabilities.

The increased expenditure is expected to go towards Indian purchases of fighter aircraft, naval ships, and modern warfare equipment, including drones, The Week reported.

India is looking to create a rocket-missile force with weapons that can hit targets at different ranges, the chief of the army staff said, explaining that such a force is essential to boosting combat effectiveness.

New Delhi approved a string of defense purchases in 2025, allocating $8.8 billion in December.

This followed a nod for purchases worth about $7.6 billion in August, which included BrahMos missiles and armed drones, along with upgrades to other existing platforms.

India, one of the world's top defense importers, has historically relied on Moscow for equipment and technology. It views Russian missile technology as central to maintaining an airpower balance with its neighbors.

Discussions between Moscow and New Delhi on manufacturing Sukhoi Su-57 aircraft in India are reportedly at an advanced stage. Moscow is an active partner in New Delhi's plans to make weapons locally, with some Russian defense equipment being already manufactured under licensing agreements in India.

MOSCOW, February 2. /TASS/. Afghanistan is an observer state in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and Kabul considers it appropriate to resume active participation in its work, Afghanistan's Ambassador to Russia, Gul Hassan, said in an interview with TASS.

When asked whether the Afghan side considers it possible to resume cooperation with the SCO, the ambassador answered affirmatively.

""Yes, Afghanistan is an observer state in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and, in accordance with this status, should participate in its meetings,"" the diplomat said in his first interview as head of the diplomatic mission in Moscow.

Thus, according to the ambassador, thanks to the efforts of Moscow and Beijing, most of the organization's member states ""have come to the conclusion that it would be viable to restore Afghanistan's active participation in the SCO's work.""

""We also count on Afghanistan's participation in the organization's upcoming meetings,"" he added.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, February 2. /TASS/. Paris is preparing neo-colonial coups d'etat on the African continent and seeking opportunities for ""political revenge"" in Africa, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service's (SVR) press bureau reported.

""France is preparing neo-colonial coups in Africa,"" the statement said. According to information received by the SVR, ""Emmanuel Macron's administration is feverishly seeking opportunities for 'political revenge' in Africa.""

According to the press bureau, Paris has recently suffered significant ""losses"" on the continent due to patriotic forces prioritizing the interests of the people and ""refusing to serve as puppets of the financial and political oligarchy of French globalists"" coming to power in a number of former French colonies in Africa. ""Whether inspired by the American operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro or imagining himself as the arbiter of the fate of African peoples, Macron has authorized his special services to launch a plan to eliminate 'undesirable leaders' in Africa,"" the press bureau pointed out.

The SVR also noted that France's involvement in the January 3 attempted coup in Burkina Faso, which was successfully thwarted, has already been established. ""The rebels were tasked with killing President Ibrahim Traore, one of the leaders of the fight against neocolonialism. According to Paris' calculations, this would not only bring pro-French forces to power in Ouagadougou but also deal a blow to all supporters of sovereignty and Pan-African ideology on the continent,"" the statement said.

The SVR also pointed out that despite the failure of their criminal plan, ""the hard-line racists in Paris are not giving up"": their focus is on destabilizing the situation in ""undesirable countries"" in the Sahara-Sahel region with the help of local terrorist groups and the Ukrainian regime, which supplies the militants with drones and instructors. ""The main target of this gang is Mali. Attacks on fuel trucks, attempts to blockade Malian cities, and terrorizing civilians all serve one purpose: creating conditions for the overthrow of President Assimi Goita. Paris continues to look for opportunities to sow chaos in the Central African Republic,"" the Foreign Intelligence Service added.

According to its press bureau, ""another target of the French leadership's destructive attention"" was Madagascar, where forces committed to developing relations with BRICS came to power in October 2025. ""Paris is working on ways to overthrow the country's new president Michael Randrianirina, and to 'restore a loyal regime',"" the SVR noted.

""In essence, France has moved to directly support various terrorists who are becoming its main allies on the African continent. This makes the political bankruptcy of [Emmanuel] Macron's policy all the more obvious, as he has failed to rid France of its reputation in Africa as a parasitic metropolis that robs its former colonies and hinders their development,"" the press bureau concluded.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Trump supporter Júnior Pena falsely claimed migrants being rounded up, including Brazilians, were ‘all crooks'

A rightwing Brazilian influencer who claimed Donald Trump's immigration crackdown targeted only “crooks” has been arrested by ICE agents in New Jersey.

Júnior Pena, whose full name is Eustáquio da Silva Pena Júnior, declared his support for the US president in a recent video message to his hundreds of thousands of social media followers.

“I [support] Donald Trump – I like the guy,” announced the South American TikToker and Instagrammer whose account purports to show “the reality of the United States” from a migrant's perspective.

In a previous video, Pena reportedly urged Brazilians to stay calm and not “despair” after reports that ICE agents were rounding up migrants, including Brazilians. “But they're all crooks. The lot of them,” he falsely claimed of the migrants being seized.

On Saturday, Pena was himself reportedly detained and sent to the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. One friend told the local newspaper the Brazilian Times that Pena had been taken into custody after missing a court hearing. The detainee's lawyer, Andrew Lattarulo, was reportedly trying to resolve the situation and prevent him being transferred to another state.

The Brazilian influencer has reportedly lived in the US since 2009 and hails from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais, from where a large number of people have emigrated to the US and Europe.

Pena uses his social networks to echo the stories of migrants as well as voices critical of Brazil's leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and those supportive of its recently jailed former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who is an ally of Trump.

The US's estimated 2 million-strong Brazilian community has been badly affected by Trump's anti-migrant offensive, with the number of deported Brazilians hitting a record high of 2,785 last year, compared with 1,640 in 2024.

In a recent report about the “veritable manhunt” playing out under Trump, the Brazilian magazine Veja warned readers: “There is an atmosphere of fear on the streets where anyone who ‘looks foreign' can be a target … irrespective of their [immigration] status.”

The magazine said Brazilian migrants in cities such as Boston were adopting drastic “survival tactics” including not speaking Portuguese in public and trying to dress like “average Americans” when leaving their homes.

Leftwing Brazilians flocked to Pena's Instagram account to taunt him after news of his detention went viral. “You supported Trump and in the end you suffered the consequences,” wrote one. “What goes around comes around,” a second critic posted.

Friends of the influencer posted messages asking his followers to pray.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Providers are arranging home visits and telehealth as neighbors pick up prescriptions, groceries and diapers

A public health crisis is unfolding in Minnesota as people targeted by federal agents are afraid to seek healthcare while some healthcare staff are also fearful for their safety at work.

Community organizations and health providers are now arranging home visits, telehealth appointments and other alternate care.

“We're seeing residents not wanting to leave their homes, not go to work, not go to their doctor appointments, not going to their regularly scheduled checkups, postponing surgeries, postponing care,” said Angela Conley, Hennepin county commissioner for district 4, where Renee Good was killed.

People who have been targeted by federal agents because of the color of their skin, their accent or their immigration status are now avoiding leaving their homes to seek routine or even emergency healthcare. They fear unfamiliar cars idling outside clinics and in hospital parking garages. Pregnant patients are laboring at home; diabetic patients are diluting or forgoing their insulin; injured and sick people are avoiding the hospital and postponing surgeries.

“They are afraid of being pulled out of their car and taken to the Whipple building and sent on a flight to Texas, even our legal permanent residents, United States citizens. Everybody is afraid,” Conley added.

Munira Maalimisaq, founder and CEO of the Inspire Change Clinic in Minneapolis, noted that “even people who are documented are not going to their doctor's appointments. People who have their citizenship are not coming in.”

“It is a health issue. When people are too afraid to seek care, diseases worsen and emergencies increase and people die unnecessarily,” Maalimisaq said.

Providers said that there are immediate and long-term health dangers from the federal occupation of Minnesota, including clashes with agents, stress, food insecurity, exacerbation of chronic illness and acute emergencies.

“If people aren't getting their medications and they're not getting their treatments, they will die,” said Mary Turner, president of National Nurses United (NNU) and an ICU nurse in the Minneapolis area. “I dread the day that the stories start to come out about finding people dead in their homes because they're afraid to seek medical care … We're going to start to find dead bodies.”

Many organizations, including NNU, are calling for the abolition of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“All they've become now is a violent, racist, lawless agency, and you can see that in our streets. And we're saying as a nursing organization: not one more penny goes to ICE,” Turner said.

Community organizations, local programs and volunteers have quickly pivoted to arranging home visits for medical care and offering telehealth where it's appropriate. Neighbors are arranging rides to clinic visits and hospitals and picking up prescriptions, groceries, formula and diapers.

“We are all working very diligently to make sure hospitals are as safe as they possibly can be, and that we can amplify existing systems for alternative care like telehealth and home health and prescription delivery,” said Erin Stevens, a physician in Minneapolis and member with the Committee to Protect Health Care.

As patients began canceling appointments or failing to show up at all, Maalimisaq decided to create a rapid response unit at her clinic in December. Soon, she received a call from a stranger, someone who had heard of her work in the community and wanted to know whether she could check on a church member who was nine months pregnant. Maalimisaq and an OB-GYN visited the woman's home and discovered she was 8cm dilated, nearly ready to deliver the baby. But the woman refused to go by ambulance to the hospital.

“She was so fearful that they were going to take her away while she was in labor,” Maalimisaq said. She called ahead to the hospital and arranged to meet in a safe place, and Maalimisaq and the physician drove the laboring woman to the hospital, where she safely delivered her baby.

Doctors began calling Maalimisaq to see whether the rapid response unit could deliver seizure medications and check on pregnant patients. The requests flooded in, but they didn't have enough staff at the clinic, so they put out a call to local providers. More than 150 providers answered: emergency physicians, cardiologists, pediatricians, “everything that you could think of”, Maalimisaq said. They take care of wounds and sprains, administer medications, drop off food and sometimes serve as a shoulder to cry on.

Officials are urging people to continue receiving healthcare. “Go to the hospital if you're sick, please go to the clinic, go to your appointment,” Conley emphasized, but added that, for those who cannot leave, “we will come to you”.

Immediately after Good's killing, Hennepin county and the city of Minneapolis created a program called Operation Reconnect, a kind of incident command center available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for public health during this crisis. They have also partnered with neighborhood organizations on food drives, clothing swaps and transportation for medical visits.

“It's a public health crisis because people don't have access to what they typically would, whether it is baby formula, whether it is getting for their mental health visits or picking up prescriptions that they need,” Conley said.

Most areas of clinics and hospitals are considered private property, which federal agents need signed judicial warrants to enter. Hospital staff have also been trained on what to do if agents appear.

“They're going to places where people are vulnerable,” Conley said of federal agents. But she hasn't heard of any instances of agents camping out in the lobby or other public areas of hospitals: “I want to be very clear: our hospital is a safe space where people who are in need of emergency care can go get care.”

These health issues accumulate atop the immediate dangers of the clashes: car crashes, teargas and pepper spray, rubber bullets and actual bullets. Detainees report poor conditions and a lack of adequate medical care. Liam Conejo Ramos, the five-year-old asylum seeker detained in Minneapolis who became ill with fever, vomiting and lethargy, was held until Saturday at Dilley Immigration Processing Center in Texas, where a measles outbreak was detected on Friday. There were 32 deaths in ICE custody last year.

Health providers, including doctors, nurses, aides and workers in housekeeping and food service, are also fearful of being detained. The Department of Homeland Security is auditing at least one hospital's employment records.

At Turner's hospital, workers under threat are leaving their contact information and other details – whether they have family members and pets at home – in sealed envelopes with their union representatives.

“If they all of a sudden don't show up, their information is sealed somewhere safely,” Turner said.

Maalimisaq, who is Somali, says she and her staff “show up” and do the work, but she battles the daily fear that they will be targeted next.

“I've never felt this vulnerable,” Maalimisaq said, but added: “There is no way I would ever sit back and not do something because it puts me in harm's way. Their lives would be in danger if we didn't provide the care that they needed.”

Many of her patients are not able to speak up for themselves right now, which is why “we as healthcare providers are using our voice, Maalimisaq said. “Healthcare needs to remain safe and accessible for everyone. We will do anything it takes to do that.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Lawsuit accuses Marco Rubio and state department of imposing ‘nationality based ban on legal immigration' based on an ‘unsupported and demonstrably false claim'

Immigrant right groups, nonprofits, legal organizations and several citizens have sued the Trump administration over the visa ban on 75 countries, issued in January.

In the lawsuit, they accuse secretary of state Marco Rubio and the state department of implementing a “categorical nationality-based ban on legal immigration” for nationals of 75 countries based on “an unsupported and demonstrably false claim that nationals of the covered countries migrate to the United States to improperly rely on cash welfare and are likely to become ‘public charges'”.

Filed in a federal court in Manhattan, the plaintiffs cite examples of people from the list of countries – the overwhelming majority of which are non-European with significant nonwhite populations – who are unable to continue pursuing legal pathways to stay in the US because of the ban. In some cases, they are living with family members who have valid status in the US.

Donald Trump has announced that after a call with India's prime minister Narendra Modi they had agreed to lower tariffs between their countries.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that India had agreed to halt purchases of Russian oil, committed to reducing tariffs on US goods to zero, and committed to purchasing over $500bn worth ofAmerican products, covering energy, technology, and agriculture. In return, Trump announced a reduction of “reciprocal” tariffs on Indian goods from 25% to 18% “effective immediately”.

Truth added that India had agreed “to buy much more [oil] from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela.”

Modi confirmed the tariff reduction in a post on X, where he also praised Trump's “efforts for peace”.

Trade talks between the US and India stalled last year owing to several factors, including New Delhi's continued reliance on Russian oil, which proved a major sticking point amid Trump's efforts to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

In a letter to Democratic House members, the ranking member of the homeland security committee, Bennie Thompson, has urged his colleagues to vote against the package of bills that would keep much of the government funded, and a stopgap measure to keep the Department of Homeland Security operating for two weeks while negotiations continue.

“Democrats must act now to demand real changes that protect our communities before Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) receive another dollar in funding,” Thompson writes in a letter, co-signed by his Democratic colleagues on the House homeland security committee.

Thompson notes that Democrats should not pass the short-term relief to allow for negotiations. Noting that they should ensure several provisions, like the use of judicial warrants to carry out arrests and ensuring immigration officers are identifiable, are already included.

Democratic congresswoman Joyce Beatty has slammed the Donald Trump's announcement that the John F Kennedy Center, DC's foremost performing arts venue, will cease events for two years while it undergoes renovations.

Beatty, a representative from Ohio, said that the president had “acted with total disregard for Congress”, since the center receives a portion of its funding through appropriations. “Congress should have been consulted on any decision to shut down its operations or undertake major renovations, especially for a two-year period,” she said in a statement.

“Countless employees, artists, and others have existing contracts and agreements with the Center. What happens to them? Has Trump or his handpicked Board given any consideration to their livelihoods or futures? This is precisely why congressional oversight is essential,” she added.

After Trump returned to office last year he jettisoned the existing board, installed himself as chairman, and ensured that his handpicked board of trustees voted to rename the venue as the “Trump-Kennedy Center”. However, any official legal change to the name would require congressional approval.

In response to the president's takeover, several artists and production companies have decided to cut ties with the Kennedy Center in protest.

A new CBS News contributor, Peter Attia, is mentioned more than 1,700 times in the latest release of Epstein files from the justice department. Just days ago, the Guardian reported that Attia – who hosts a popular podcast about longevity –had joined the ranks at CBS under embattled editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.

Throughout the email exchanges released by the DoJ, Attia corresponded with Epstein on dozens of occasions after the late sex-offender pleaded guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution, and registers as a sexual offended.

“I get JE withdrawal when I don't see him,” Attia writes in an email to Epstein's assistant on 21 January 2016.

In CBS News' press release, announcing Attia's hiring, they note that he is “the founder of Outlive"", a new app that translates longevity science into personalized daily practice” as well as Early Medical, “a medical practice that applies the principles of Medicine 3.0 to patients, aiming to simultaneously lengthen their lifespan and increase their healthspan”.

In a 2023 interview with the Guardian, Attia outlined many of his theories around the science of longevity.

In a previous video, Pena reportedly urged Brazilians to stay calm and not “despair” after reports that ICE agents were rounding up migrants, including Brazilians. “But they're all crooks. The lot of them,” he falsely claimed of the migrants being seized.

On Saturday, Pena was himself reportedly detained and sent to the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. One friend told the local newspaper the Brazilian Times that Pena had been taken into custody after missing a court hearing. The detainee's lawyer, Andrew Lattarulo, was reportedly trying to resolve the situation and prevent him being transferred to another state.

The Brazilian influencer has reportedly lived in the US since 2009 and hails from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais, a state long known as a major source of migrants to the US and Europe.

House speaker Mike Johnson is set to swear in Christian Menefee, a Democrat who recently won a runoff election for a reliably blue seat in Texas.

Menefee's victory, however, means the margin in the House is even more slim: 218 Republicans to 214 Democrats. His current term will end at the end of the year, and he'll have to start campaigning almost immediately for the 2026 midterms. But this time, it will be for a new district, after the GOP-controlled legislature successfully gerrymandered the state's congressional map.

The House will try and advance a five-bill funding package, as well as a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today.

Late last week, the Senate voted to pass the final bundle of appropriations bills, but separated legislation that funds the DHS, amid widespread backlash over the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. While the House prepares to vote, a partial shutdown is under way.

Instead, lawmakers in the upper chamber voted to pass a stopgap measure to keep the DHS operating for two weeks while Democrats hammer out negotiations with the Trump administration over the future of federal immigration enforcement.

Republican House speaker Mike Johnson has signalled to GOP representatives that this path is White House-sanctioned, and urging them to get on board. But he can only afford to lose one member of his own party to pass the funding bills, and he'll also need to shore up support across the aisle.

Early reports show there are already cracks among Democrats, with some stating they'll support the legislation that the Senate passed, while others don't feel any negotiations with the president will be in good faith. On Sunday, Johnson even said that Democrats' current demands – to require federal immigration officers to show their faces and to obtain judicial warrants for any raids – are futile.

One quick note, Donald Trump is in Washington today. He'll take part in signing time today, but that's not open to the press. We'll let you know if that changes.

At present, we're not expecting to hear from the president today.

Beloved groundhog Punxsutawney Phil is said to be predicting six more weeks of wintry weather after he saw his shadow earlier today.

His annual prediction was translated by his handlers at Gobbler's Knob in western Pennsylvania.

The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club says that when Phil is deemed to have not seen his shadow, that means there will be an early spring. When he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter.

Phil tends to predict a longer winter far more often than an early spring.

Tens of thousands of people were on hand at Gobbler's Knob for the annual ritual that goes back more than a century, with ties to ancient farming traditions in Europe.

Punxsutawney's festivities have grown considerably since the 1993 movie Groundhog Day, starring Bill Murray.

Construction has resumed on four offshore wind mega-projects after they survived a near-fatal attack by Donald Trump's administration thanks to rulings by federal judges. These are being seen as victories for clean energy amid a wider war being waged on it by the Trump administration.

The windfarms are considered critical by grid planners as America faces an energy affordability crisis. Together, the four projects will contribute nearly five gigawatts of energy to the east coast, enough to power 3.5m homes.

In December, the Trump administration issued an order halting the construction of five offshore wind projects along the east coast, citing “reasons of national security”. On 9 January, during a White House meeting with oil and gas executives, the president said: “My goal is to not let any windmill be built. They're losers.”

But in mid-January, federal judges rejected the administration's claims and allowed construction to resume on four of the five projects. Work began immediately on Vineyard Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Empire Wind 1 and Revolution Wind. A fifth project, Sunrise Wind, is also fighting the stop work order and has a court hearing on Monday that industry experts believe will have a positive outcome.

Judges across different jurisdictions ruled against the Trump administration. “This is a broad rejection of the administration's arguments,” said John Carlson, the senior north-east regional policy manager for the climate non-profit Clean Air Task Force.

The stop-work order argued that wind turbines could interfere with military radar, but Carlson said it was a pretext to undermine wind power. “All these projects already went through very significant national security reviews,” he said.

“He's losing in court, and I think he will continue losing in court. But that's not the entire playing field,” Carlson noted.

To the wind industry, the court rulings are bittersweet. Trump may be losing the court battle against offshore projects already under construction, but he has succeeded in causing a nosedive in new projects, leaving the industry and its allies longing for the day he leaves office.

A public health crisis is unfolding in Minnesota as people targeted by federal agents are afraid to seek healthcare while some healthcare staff are also fearful for their safety at work.

Community organizations and health providers are now arranging home visits, telehealth appointments and other alternate care.

“We're seeing residents not wanting to leave their homes, not go to work, not go to their doctor appointments, not going to their regularly scheduled checkups, postponing surgeries, postponing care,” said Angela Conley, Hennepin county commissioner for district 4, where Renee Good was killed.

People who have been targeted by federal agents because of the color of their skin, their accent or their immigration status are now avoiding leaving their homes to seek routine or even emergency healthcare. They fear unfamiliar cars idling outside clinics and in hospital parking garages. Pregnant patients are laboring at home; diabetic patients are diluting or forgoing their insulin; injured and sick people are avoiding the hospital and postponing surgeries.

“They are afraid of being pulled out of their car and taken to the Whipple building and sent on a flight to Texas, even our legal permanent residents, United States citizens. Everybody is afraid,” Conley added.

Munira Maalimisaq, founder and CEO of the Inspire Change Clinic in Minneapolis, noted that “even people who are documented are not going to their doctor's appointments People who have their citizenship are not coming in.”

“It is a health issue. When people are too afraid to seek care, diseases worsen and emergencies increase and people die unnecessarily,” Maalimisaq said.

Washington is negotiating with Havana's leadership to strike a deal, Donald Trump has said, days after threatening Cuba's reeling economy with a virtual oil blockade.

“Cuba is a failing nation. It has been for a long time but now it doesn't have Venezuela to prop it up. So we're talking to the people from Cuba, the highest people in Cuba, to see what happens,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida on Sunday.

“I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba.”

Trump gave no indication what such a deal might entail.

The US president had said on Saturday: “It doesn't have to be a humanitarian crisis. I think they probably would come to us and want to make a deal … They have a situation that's very bad for Cuba. They have no money. They have no oil. They lived off Venezuelan money and oil, and none of that's coming now.”

Trump's second administration has been ratcheting up pressure on the communist-run island nation off south Florida since it ousted the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, whose country was a close ally of Havana and a crucial source for oil exports to Cuba.

The Reuters news agency is reporting that the US envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to visit Israel for meetings with the country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its military chief, Eyal Zamir, citing two senior Israeli officials.

Witkoff's visit will reportedly begin tomorrow. We don't know exactly what will be discussed but the trip comes as the Gaza ceasefire agreement edges forward despite Israel's frequent killing of Palestinian people in violation of its terms.

The next phases of Donald Trump's plan for Gaza require governance to be handed to Palestinian technocrats, Hamas to lay down its weapons and Israeli troops to withdraw from the territory while Gaza is rebuilt.

The disclosure of more than 3m files related to Jeffrey Epstein suggests that other men were involved in his sexual abuse, prompting questions about officials' contentions that there isn't evidence to investigate third parties for potential involvement in the late financier's crimes.

Some newly released documents contain allegations that Epstein provided victims to other men. Documents released in prior disclosures, as well as court documents, also point to others' possible criminal involvement with Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.

One accuser said that Maxwell told her that Epstein had to leave his house but that there was a friend staying who she could massage. During this encounter, this associate allegedly offered her money if she engaged in sex.

The woman alleged that she did so and that this friend paid her money. A “prosecution memorandum” dated 26 January 2021 and signed by assistant US attorneys from the southern district of New York described this encounter and said that when the woman's lawyers showed her a photo of disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, she identified him as this man. The names of the US attorneys are redacted.

It's not clear to what extent authorities investigated these allegations. Weinstein was never charged for any conduct related to Epstein.

One document, and FBI presentation that appears to have been created sometime after late July 2025, described an allegation that Epstein “told [an accuser] to give [Harvey] Weinstein a massage, during which Weinstein tells her to take off her shirt, she refuses and then Weinstein threatens to get women to come force her too.”

Weinstein, who is in jail after being convicted of sexual assault and was one of the most prominent targets of the MeToo movement, rejects misconduct claims.

President Donald Trump is once again in the mood for litigation. This morning he has threatened to sue Grammys host Trevor Noah after a joke he made about Jeffrey Epstein on stage.

Joking that this will be his last year as host, Noah quipped:

Song of the Year - that is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense because Epstein's island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton.

In repsonse, the US president said the comedian, who hosted The Daily Show on Comedy Central in the US for seven years, was a “total loser”, adding:

It looks like I'll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C., and suing him for plenty.

Trump criticised South African-born Noah‘s joke, made after the song of the year gong was handed out.

Writing on Truth Social, in his usual frenetic, rambling style, Trump said:

Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!!

I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory statement, have never been accused of being there, not even by the Fake News Media.

Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast.

He added:

Get ready Noah, I'm going to have some fun with you!

In recent years, Trump has resorted to legal action against a slew of media outlets including the BBC, the New York Times, the Associated Press and the Wall Street Journal.

Last July, US media giant Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay Trump $16m to settle a lawsuit over a CBS interview with Kamala Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee.

In other developments:

Trump announced a two-year closure of the Kennedy Center, citing construction needs to make the “finest performing arts facility of its kind, anywhere in the world”. Writing on Truth Social on Sunday evening, Trump added that the center's closure will pave way for a “new and spectacular entertainment complex”.

The deputy US attorney general, Todd Blanche, the point person on the Trump administration's Epstein files release, told ABC News on Sunday that prosecutors' review of the Jeffrey Epstein-Ghislaine Maxwell sex-trafficking case “is over”. While Blanche acknowledged “there's a lot of horrible photographs that appear to be taken by Mr Epstein or by people around him … that doesn't allow us necessarily to prosecute somebody”.

Government documents have identified the two federal officers who fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis as Jesus Ochoa, a border patrol agent, and Raymundo Gutierrez, an officer with Customs and Border Protection (CBP), according to ProPublica. According to those records, Ochoa, 43, and Gutierrez, 35, were the agents who fired their weapons during the confrontation last weekend that resulted in Pretti's death.

A five-year-old boy and his father were back in Minneapolis on Sunday after being released from a Texas immigration detention center where they were held for more than a week, according to US House representative Joaquin Castro.

Trump said his administration was in talks with Cuban leadership over a potential deal, following his earlier threats to stop the country from importing oil.

The ongoing partial US government shutdown is expected to continue into early next week, with no reopening likely before Tuesday, if what federal officials on both sides of the country's political aisle are saying is any indication.

All vaccine recommendations are being reconsidered by the US's vaccines committee, according to its top adviser, who in recent interviews slammed the requirements for attending school and said vaccines should be taken on the advice of an individual's doctor.

China Airlines yesterday announced that it would fly the national baseball team to Japan for the World Baseball Classic (WBC) next month, adding that it is offering discounted flights to Japan for all travelers from now until Feb. 22.

Calling baseball a unifying sport for Taiwanese, the airline said it hopes Taiwan can recreate its historic run to win the World Baseball Softball Confederation's Premier12 title in November 2024.

The airline also sponsors three Taiwanese baseball players competing in the WBC: including pitcher Lin Yu-min (林昱?), who plays for the Arizona Diamondbacks' Triple-A affiliate the Reno Aces; Chen Po-yu (陳柏毓), who pitches for the Pittsburgh Pirates' Triple-A affiliate the Indianapolis Indians; and infielder Cheng Tsung-che (鄭宗哲), who last year played for the Pirates.

China Airlines also created a Web site (https://teamtaiwan.china-airlines.com) for baseball fans wanting to cheer for the national team in Tokyo to keep track of flight information, including charter fights.

The Team Taiwan logo would appear on pillows, cups and headrest covers on the charter flights, the airline said.

The airline said it is offering special airfare to Japan for all travelers through Feb. 22, with discounts starting at 22 percent.

A one-way flight from Taipei to Tokyo costs NT$9,492 before tax, while a one-way flight from Taipei to Osaka costs NT$9,660 before tax.

Starting on Feb. 24, participants of interactive games designed by the airline would have a chance to receive codes for airfare discounts, China Airlines said.

The airline said that it has joined other corporations in organizing group screenings of the Taiwanese documentary Hero! Hito! (冠軍之路) about Taiwan's Premier12 run.

With Nipah infections being reported in other countries and considering its relatively high fatality rate, the centers on Jan. 16 announced that it would be listed as a notifiable infectious disease to bolster the nation's systematic early warning system and increase public awareness, the CDC said.

The officers had personal information on the prosecutors, including “when they were assigned to their posts, their work locations and job titles,” MAC Deputy Minister and spokesman Liang Wen-chieh (梁文傑) said.
On top of asking about their agencies and positions, the officers also questioned the prosecutors about the Cross-Strait Joint Crime-Fighting and Judicial Mutual Assistance Agreement, a pact that serves as the framework for Taiwan-China cooperation on combating crime and providing judicial assistance, Liang

A Russian drone strike on Dnipro hit a bus carrying mineworkers and killed at least a dozen people, authorities said on Sunday, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that the next round of peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations would take place tomorrow and on Thursday.

The strike injured several more people and sparked a fire that was subsequently put out, emergency services said.

DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, said it owned the bus and accused Russia of carrying out “a large-scale terrorist attack on DTEK mines in the Dnipropetrovsk region,” whose capital is Dnipro.

“The epicenter of one of the attacks was a company bus transporting miners from the enterprise after a shift in the Dnipropetrovsk region,” the company said on social media.

The strike came days after US President Donald Trump said that the Kremlin had agreed to temporarily halt the targeting of the Ukrainian capital and other cities, as the region suffers under freezing temperatures that have brought widespread hardship.

Ukrainian Minister of Energy Denys Shmyhal on Sunday called the strike in Dnipro “a cynical and targeted attack on energy sector workers,” and said it occurred near the Ternivska mine east of the city.

Hours earlier, Ukraine's emergency services reported that Russian attack drones injured six people at a maternity hospital in Zaporizhzhia, southern Ukraine, on Sunday morning.

Meanwhile, envoys from Russia, Ukraine and the US had been expected to meet on Sunday in Abu Dhabi to continue negotiations aimed at ending Moscow's all-out invasion of its neighbor, but on Sunday morning, Zelenskiy announced that they would take place later this week instead.

“We have just had a report from our negotiating team. The dates for the next trilateral meetings have been set: Feb. 4 and 5 in Abu Dhabi. Ukraine is ready for substantive talks, and we are interested in an outcome that will bring us closer to a real and dignified end to the war,” Zelenskiy said on social media.

There was no immediate comment from US or Russian officials.

On Saturday afternoon, top Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev said that he had held a “constructive meeting with the US peacemaking delegation” in Florida.

Officials have so far revealed few details of the talks in Abu Dhabi, which are part of a year-long effort by the Trump administration to steer the sides toward a peace deal and end almost four years of war.

While Ukrainian and Russian officials have agreed in principle with Washington's calls for a compromise, Moscow and Kyiv differ deeply over what an agreement should look like.

A central issue is whether Russia should keep or withdraw from areas of Ukraine its forces have occupied, especially Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland the Donbas, and whether it should get land there that it has not yet captured.

Earlier on Sunday, Russian attack drones struck a maternity hospital in southern Ukraine, the emergency service reported.

It said the strike wounded three women in the hospital in Zaporizhzhia, and also sparked a fire in the gynecology reception area that was later extinguished. Regional administration head Ivan Fedorov later said the number of injured had risen to six.

The Russian Ministry of Defense on Sunday said that air defenses shot down 21 Ukrainian drones flying over southwestern and western Russia.

It did not mention any casualties or damage.

China's annual Spring Festival travel rush, a 40-day period commonly referred to as the world's largest annual human migration, commenced yesterday ahead of an extended Lunar New Year holiday.

This year's Lunar New Year, ushering in the Year of the Horse, falls on Feb. 17 and will be accompanied by an extra-long nine-day public holiday in China, running from Feb. 15 to 23.

It is hoped a longer holiday (last year's break was eight days) might prompt Chinese consumers to boost consumption by spending more on travel and meals this festival period.

Many Chinese consumers have been shaken by the nation's uncertain economic outlook and would rather save than spend. Homeowners have seen their assets depreciate in a years-long property market slump, while weaker growth momentum since the COVID-19 pandemic has added to job insecurity.

That said, a state planning official last week said that China expects a record 9.5 billion passenger trips to be made during the period, surpassing the 9.02 billion trips made last year.

“Why do I feel it's even more stressful to buy tickets this year compared with last year? For example, the flight back to my home is already sold out,” said 32-year-old Liu, a traveler flying out of Guangzhou airport yesterday. “If you don't buy early, the price range fluctuates a lot, and can even double.”

Major travel platforms reported Lunar New Year bookings already surpassing last year's levels. According to data from Flight Master, as of the middle of last month, bookings for domestic flights during the holiday exceeded 4.13 million, up about 21 percent year-on-year.

Popular outbound destinations are concentrated in Southeast Asia, with those flights accounting for nearly 50 percent of the total and Thailand among the leading destinations.

Following a geopolitical spat between China and Japan late last year, routes to Japan have dropped sharply, down more than 40 percent, according to Flight Master.

Domestically, culturally rich “intangible heritage towns,” such as such as Huangshan in Anhui Province, Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province, Quanzhou in Fujian Province, Foshan in Guangdong Province and Zigong in Sichuan Province have emerged as popular destinations, online travel agency Qunar said.

This is Asami Terajima reporting from a very cold Kyiv on day 1,440 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story:

Russian troops are trying to ""bypass and infiltrate"" the destroyed town of Vovchansk in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, and the situation is ""frankly difficult,"" Viktor Tregubov, a spokesman for Ukraine's Joint Forces in charge of the area, said on Feb. 2. 

Speaking on national TV, Tregubov said Russian troops are pressing on Ukrainian positions on the outskirts of Vovchansk. 

""The city is completely destroyed, there is no infrastructure to serve as a barrier,"" Tregubov said, as cited by Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform. 

""And the Russians have been pressing there for a very long time, and the distance to the border is minimal.""

Vovchansk — just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Russian border — endured Russian occupation until the 2022 autumn Ukrainian counter-offensive liberated the town, only to face heavy fighting again after Russia began a new push in May 2024, forcing many residents to flee their homes.

Updated 5:40 p.m. Kyiv time

Russia struck a coal mine operated by Ukraine's biggest private energy firm, DTEK, in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast for the second time over the past day, the company said on Feb. 2.

The Feb. 2 attack damaged administrative buildings at the facility. No casualties were reported in the strike, according to the statement.

The news follows a deadly Russian drone attack on a bus carrying miners, which killed at least 12 people and injured 16 others on Feb. 1. in the town of Ternivka.

The attack represents the largest single loss for DTEK since the start of the full-scale war, CEO Maksym Timchenko said.

Feb. 2 was declared a day of mourning in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in memory of the miners killed in the recent strike.

Updated 4:52 p.m. Kyiv time

The Ukrainian government approved a resolution on Feb. 2 mandating the registration of Starlink terminals to prevent their use by Russian forces, Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced.

The move follows reports of Russia using Starlink-equipped drones, which are particularly difficult to intercept due to their low-altitude flight and resistance to electronic warfare.

Under the resolution, Ukraine will introduce a so-called ""whitelist"" for Starlink terminals, with all unverified devices to be disconnected. The system will be implemented in cooperation with SpaceX, the manufacturer of Starlink terminals.

Fedorov said these measures are currently the only technical solution to counter the use of the technology by Russian forces.

Fedorov's statement came days after Ukraine's Defense Ministry reached out to SpaceX, urging the company to prevent Russian drones from using Starlink, as the satellite internet system could help them to operate further over Ukraine.

The company responded swiftly, with U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk writing on Feb. 1 that SpaceX's efforts to halt ""unauthorized"" Russian use of Starlink seemed to have worked.

SpaceX's initial steps to stop Russia from using Starlink to control attack drones over Ukraine are already delivering ""real results,"" Fedorov said on Feb. 1.

Updated 4:50 p.m. Kyiv time 

Ukraine's General Staff reported on Feb. 2 ""a series of effective strikes"" on Russian command posts in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. 

Overnight Ukrainian drone strikes hit two Russian command posts, one regimental and another divisional level, in the Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast, as well as an ammunition depot, according to the General Staff. 

In another hot spot of the war, down in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian drone strikes hit Russia's drone command posts, the General Staff also claimed. 

""The Defense Forces are systematically undermining the offensive potential of the Russian occupiers in order to stop Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine,"" the General Staff wrote in its Telegram post. 

Updated 3:30 p.m. Kyiv time

More than 200 buildings in Kyiv remain without heating as temperatures plunge, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 2. 

Zelensky said that the lack of heating in over 200 buildings is mostly due to the Jan. 31 outage, which authorities said was caused by technical malfunctions amid freezing temperatures. 

Russia has scaled up its energy blitz in January, targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure with barrages of missiles and drones in an attempt to lower Ukrainians' morale as they try to survive in cold temperatures, often without electricity, heating, or water. 

Updated 3:20 p.m. Kyiv time

A shortage of air defense missiles has left some Ukrainian air defense systems empty at times amid the threat of further Russian attacks, Yurii Ihnat, head of the Air Force's communications department, said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on Feb. 2.

With the onset of winter, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in an effort to plunge the country into a nationwide blackout. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air defense forces lack sufficient resources to intercept all Russian missiles and drones.

Ihnat said that Ukrainian authorities, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have repeatedly stressed the shortage of missiles for air defense systems, noting that some of them are depleted and not ready to repel Russian attacks.

""Indeed, before one such attack, we were provided with the necessary means a day in advance,"" Ihnat said. ""Ukrainian forces repelled that massive strike quite successfully, thanks to missiles for F-16s, NASAMS, IRIS-T, and Patriot.""

""There were moments when there was a serious shortage of these missiles. I won't reveal any secrets. For example, there is a NASAMS system, but instead of six missiles in the launcher, there are only two.""

At least 14 people have been killed and 38 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Feb. 2.

The Air Force said that Russian forces had attacked Ukraine with a ballistic missile and 171 drones, of which around 100 were Shahed-type drones. It reported downing 157 drones in the east, south, and north of the country.

In central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a Russian drone hit a bus carrying miners after their shifts near the town of Pavlohrad, killing at least 12 and injuring 16 others on Feb. 1, regional governor Oleksandr Hanzha and DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy firm, reported.

Russian attacks in the southwestern part of the region, in Nikopol and other towns nearby, wounded a 72-year-old man, Hanzha said on Feb. 1.

DTEK reported on Feb. 2 that Russia carried out another attack on its coal mining company's facility in the region, damaging its administrative buildings. No casualties were reported. 

In eastern Donetsk Oblast, regional governor Vadym Filashkin reported that two people were killed and four others were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day.

In northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported that a 20-year-old and a 52-year-old woman were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day.

In the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia and its surrounding region, 12 people were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, regional governor Ivan Fedorov reported.

A Russian drone attack targeted yet another Ukrainian Railways infrastructure, targeting a diesel locomotive, used to generate electricity from diesel fuel, in Zaporizhzhia, the Ministry for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine reported on Feb. 2.

In southern Kherson Oblast, three people were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.

Russia has lost around 1,241,530 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Jan. 29.

The number includes 850 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,627 tanks, 23,981 armored fighting vehicles, 76,585 vehicles and fuel tanks, 36,802 artillery systems, 1,633 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,291 air defense systems, 435 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 121,217 drones, 28 ships and boats, and two submarines.

Iran is weighing the terms for resuming talks with the United States soon, a Foreign Ministry official said on Monday, after both sides signalled readiness to revive diplomacy over a long-running nuclear dispute and dispel fears of a new regional war.

Tensions are running high amid a military buildup by the U.S. Navy near Iran, following a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded Iran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was “seriously talking,” while Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that arrangements for negotiations were under way.

Analysis: When it comes to Iran, is Trump a man without a plan?

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three preconditions for resumption of talks: Zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile program and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long rejected all three demands as unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers see the ballistic missile program, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Tehran was considering “the various dimensions and aspects of the talks,” adding that “time is of the essence for Iran as it wants lifting of unjust sanctions sooner.”

A senior Iranian official and a Western diplomat told Reuters that U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi could meet in Turkey in the coming day.

A Turkish ruling party official told Reuters that Tehran and Washington had agreed that this week's talks would be focused on diplomacy, a potential reprieve for possible U.S. strikes.

Witkoff is expected to visit Israel to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's military chief, two senior Israeli officials said separately on Monday.

The Iranian official said “diplomacy is ongoing. For talks to resume, Iran says there should not be preconditions and that it is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU), accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution.”

However, he added, for the start of talks, Tehran wants U.S. military assets moved away from Iran.

“Now the ball is in Trump's court,” he said.

Earlier: U.S. attack on Iran would spark ‘regional war' in Middle East, says Khamenei

Tehran's regional sway has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies - from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq - as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.

In June last year the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.

Recent satellite imagery of two of the targeted sites, Isfahan and Natanz, appear to show some repair work since December, with new roofing over two previously destroyed buildings. No other rebuilding is visible, according to the imagery provided by Planet Labs and reviewed by Reuters.

Washington-based think tank ISIS said satellite images from late January show construction work on tunnel entrances at Isfahan that could “indicate a preparation for additional military strikes” as was seen ahead of last year's U.S. strikes.

It could also signal the movement of assets from other facilities, it added.

After five rounds of talks that have stalled since May, 2023, several hard-to-bridge issues remained between Tehran and Washington, including Iran's insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil and refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium.

Since the U.S. strikes on Iran's three nuclear sites in June, Tehran says its uranium enrichment work has stopped. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has called on Iran repeatedly to say what happened to the HEU stock since the June attacks.

Western countries fear Iran's uranium enrichment could yield material for a warhead. Iran says its nuclear program is only for electricity generation and other civilian uses.

The Iranian sources said Tehran could ship its highly enriched uranium abroad and pause enrichment in a deal that should also include lifting economic sanctions.

Colombia's drug traffickers are establishing new routes through Ecuador and Peru to reach legal seaports, swapping speedboats for container ships as they adapt to U.S. military threats.Karen Toro/Reuters

The United States' aggressive boat bombing campaign targeting suspected drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere has begun to reshape Colombia's drug trade and its long-running armed conflict as criminal organizations find new ways to move cocaine, experts and Indigenous leaders say. 

But the lethal strikes by U.S. forces on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, which have killed at least 126 people since Sept. 2, have done little to make a dent in Colombia's lucrative cocaine trade. 

Bilateral drug control efforts are expected to be top of the agenda on Tuesday when Colombian President Gustavo Petro travels to Washington to meet U.S. President Donald Trump. Mr. Trump has described his Colombian counterpart as “an illegal drug dealer” and, after removing Nicolás Maduro from power in Venezuela, he had suggested Mr. Petro could be next. But a conciliatory phone call in January led to a detente. 

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's most recently published report, potential cocaine production in Colombia in 2023 was 2,664 metric tons. The Colombian government said it seized 794.5 tons of cocaine in 2024 (up to November), worth an estimated US$2.52-billion on the streets of North America and Europe, the world's largest markets.

In Colombia, “people are scared to involve themselves in trafficking and to leave on the speedboats heading toward international markets,” said Javier Florez, director of conflict and security at the Ideas for Peace Foundation, a think tank. 

However, rather than halting the cocaine trade, Operation Southern Spear, as the U.S. military effort is known, appears to have simply displaced it. 

In Colombia's Pacific region, from which most U.S.-bound cocaine departs, the country's traffickers are establishing new routes through Ecuador and Peru to reach legal seaports, swapping speedboats for container ships as they adapt to U.S. military threats, said Mr. Florez.

The Caribbean operation has also led to the carving of new routes through the Amazon rain forest into Brazil and Venezuela. The scramble to control these lucrative corridors has aggravated an existing conflict between two rebel groups, the National Liberation Army (ELN) and Second Marquetalia, an offshoot of the demobilized FARC guerrillas. Already battling over illegal economies like gold mining, the recent surge in drug trafficking has only intensified their fighting. 

“Clashes over control of drug trafficking corridors have devastated riverine communities in Venezuela and Colombia, confining or displacing populations and driving targeted killings,” said Bram Ebus, director at Amazon Underworld, an investigative journalism collective, in an interview from Bogota.

Deep in the Colombian Amazon, Indigenous leaders began to sound the alarm about a rise in criminal activity on their waterways in December, reporting a surge in boats zooming down the rivers night and day in the lawless jungle region. The threat of violence has forcibly confined at least 3,000 families who are unable to leave their villages to fish, farm and hunt, according to a report published by Mr. Ebus.

Not only has Washington's boat bombing campaign triggered conflict over new strategic routes, it has acted as a catalyst for violence in drug producing regions by pushing down the price of coca, the plant used to make cocaine. 

A round of violence broke out in late December in the northeast Catatumbo region between the ELN and Frente 33, a FARC-dissident group, after a year in which levels of violence had stabilized, said Luis Niño, the government's High Peace Adviser for the region. 

He said Washington's boat bombing campaign was one of the reasons for the violence and had raised the stakes of the conflict. 

“If [the rebels] want to export [cocaine], it must be via routes not controlled by the U.S. government, and that makes it much more complex,” said Mr. Niño, who is responsible for negotiating with guerrilla groups in Catatumbo. 

Venezuelans and Colombians in Bogotá tackle three big questions on their post-Maduro future

He said the logistical challenge of moving cocaine has pushed down the price of coca leaves and paste as fewer buyers travel to the region. Because rebel groups in Catatumbo rely on coca and its derivatives for a large portion of their revenue, the fall in prices has added a new imperative in their bloody turf war. 

Since December, about 2,600 people in Catatumbo have been forced to flee their homes by the fighting, according to Mr. Niño. 

As well as raising the stakes of the armed conflict, local farmers, the majority of whom depend on coca cultivation for their livelihood, have been hit hard. 

“There are many farmers who have the product but have not been able to sell it,” said Jaime Botero, the president of the rural community action body in Tibú, the world's largest coca-growing municipality.

The economic impact on farmers who depend on the coca trade could unleash further humanitarian consequences, and potentially fuel recruitment to armed groups, Mr. Niño said, as struggling farmers grow more desperate and more vulnerable.

Germany fell at the final hurdle at the European Men's Handball Championship, losing to co-hosts and favorites Denmark in the final. Two German players made the tournament all-star team.

Denmark became European men's handball champions for the first time in over a decade on Sunday night, beating Germany 34-27 in the final on home soil in Herning.

The Danes, co-hosts and reigning world champions, went into the final as favorites and lived up to expectations, only falling behind for a single minute in the first half.

Superstar Mathias Gidsel led the way for Denmark, the 26-year-old scoring seven times in the final to take his total tally for the tournament to 68 — smashing the European Championship record of 65 set by Norway's Sander Sagosen in 2020.

Otherwise, Germany were always chasing the game — a task made even more difficult by red cards shown to Tom Kiesler and Jannik Kohlbacher.

""First and foremost, I'm proud of our performance today and throughout the tournament,"" said German captain Johannes Golla. ""Even today, we never gave up. If you just look at the result, it looks more one-sided than the game really was.""

Golla was keen to emphasize the improvement since Germany lost 26-39 to Denmark in the 2024 Olympic final. ""In comparison to then, we can leave here with our heads held high,"" he said. ""But overall, we have to accept that it just wasn't enough today.""

Golla himself was named in tournament's all-star team along with Germany goalkeeper Andreas Wolff — even beating Denmark stopper Emil Nielsen to the nomination.

""Such awards are signs of huge appreciation for Andreas and Johannes, who always took the lead, even in difficult phases,"" said Ingo Meckes, director of sport at the German Handball Federation (DHB). ""But having two all-stars is also an achievement for the entire team, in which all 18 players played an important role. Without that, you couldn't play a tournament like this.""

Germany — where handball is the most popular team sport after football – can now look ahead with confidence to the 2027 World Championship, which it will host in Cologne, Munich, Kiel, Hanover, Magdeburg and Stuttgart.

This is a roundup of news stories from and about Germany on Monday, February 2, 2026:

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius highlighted the importance of being a step ahead when it comes to military innovation as he attended the launch of a new innovation center near Munich.

""Innovation is not just nice to have for the German armed forces. It is key to success,"" Pistorius emphasized during the opening ceremony of the facility in Erding, just outside Munich.

Pistorius pointed to drones, which have become a key feature in the war in Ukraine, as an example of the ever-changing technological landscape.

Pistorius said that artificial intelligence was expected to play a key role in possible defense and security scenarios and that the number of human casualties could be lowered ""if we send in technology first,"" the minister said.

Germany's Defense Ministry said the innovation center in Erding aims to use research, science and start-ups ""to develop and procure technologies for the conflicts of tomorrow.""

The center would focus on shortening innovation processes and get innovative systems up and running within the armed forces as soon as possible.

A Chinese student in the southern German city of Munich went on trial Monday for allegedly drugging and raping his Chinese girlfriend on film numerous times in his apartment.

Video footage showed the 27-year-old man both injecting the woman with drugs, or pressing anesthetic-soaked cloth into her face to ensure she did not wake up, investigators said. The footage was not shown to the public to protect the victim.

Prosecutors allege the man was aware the woman's life was at risk due to the heavy amount of sedatives used, and have charged him with seven counts of attempted murder, grievous bodily harm and aggravated rape, alongside other offences.

The defendant did not address the court on Monday, and is expected to do so at a later date. The court has set 18 trial dates, with a verdict expected by the end of March.

German breweries' sales of beer containing alcohol dropped by a record 6% to 7.8 billion liters (2.06 billion gallons) in 2025, official figures released on Monday show.

The figure is the lowest since records began in 1993, the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) said.

As such, it is even below that in the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, when restaurants and bars were subject to strict restrictions in a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19.

The huge reduction comes as many consumers either cut back or instead prefer to buy nonalcoholic beer, which now makes up some 10% of the market for the beverage.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has held talks in Singapore on deepening bilateral  cooperation at the start of his tour of Southeast Asia and the Pacific region.

Wadephul wrote on X that he had had a ""trustful exchange on common challenges"" at a meeting with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.

""We discussed strengthening our strong political & economic ties even further,"" he wrote, adding that the two countries had ""a lot to offer to each other as reliable & steadfast partners"" in uncertain times.

Earlier, he met with his Singaporean counterpart, Vivian Balakrishnan, with the two ministers discussing deepening the cooperation between the two countries amid a shifting global political landscape.

Wadephul stressed that ""international cooperation and multilateral institutions are being called into question,"" saying that Germany and Singapore know only too well that ""we owe our freedom, our security and our prosperity to a stable international order with reliable rules."" 

Balakrishnan also said that the world order had dramatically changed, but added that he still believed many countries ""continue to believe in a rules-based world order, in multilateralism, in the UN charter, in free and fair trade, in economic integration and in global supply chains.""

Balakrishnan called on Germany and the European Union to expand their cooperation with Singapore and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

He also raised the prospect of a future free trade agreement between the EU and the ASEAN group of states.

Daniel Halemba, a lawmaker from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AFD) party, has been handed a fine after being found guilty on charges of money laundering and coercion.

A court in the southern city of Würzburg fined Halemba altogether €30,400 ($36,066). The penalty is subject to appeal.

The 24-year-old has had a seat in the Bavarian state parliament since 2023. He was tried by a juvenile court because of his age at the time of the money-laundering offenses in 2022.

The AfD politician was convicted of transferring a four-figure sum from his private account to an account in a Baltic country, using money said to originate from fraud committed by third parties.

He was also found guilty of having intimidated a witness in the preliminary investigation before his planned interrogation by the Würzburg public prosecutor's office.

Halemba, who is considered to belong to the most extreme fringe of the Bavarian AfD chapter, was however acquitted on charges of incitement to hatred over the alleged playing of a banned song advocating the expulsion of migrants from Germany at his birthday party.

He and his lawyers have claimed that all accusations against him are politically motivated.

Five people have been taken into custody in Germany during nationwide raids on a network that is allowing the circumvention of EU sanctions on Russia imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

The five, identified as German, Ukrainian and Russian nationals, are suspected of procuring industrial goods for Russian defense companies in violation of the sanctions, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office said.

They are believed to have used shell companies to enable them to buy industrial goods and export them to Russia despite the trade restrictions.

The prosecutor's office estimated ⁠that approximately 16,000 shipments ​worth at least €30 million ($36 million) in total had been arranged since ‌February 2022.

The arrests took place in the northern port city of Lübeck and the ‌surrounding Herzogtum Lauenburg district, the prosecutors said.

Russia has found several ways of circumventing the sanctions, including with shell companies and its ""shadow fleet,"" which is a network  of often falsely flagged or renamed sea vessels used to export its sanctioned oil. 

The sanctions imposed by the EU aim to prevent Russia from gaining the revenue it needs to maintain its full-scale invasion of its neighbor.

Germany allows victims of Nazi persecution and their descendants to reclaim citizenship that was deliberately taken from them.

The number of asylum-seekers returning home after receiving financial help to do so from Germany grew markedly in 2025, according to figures from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) cited by media.

Altogether 16,576 people returned home of their own free will in 2025 under the REAG/GARP subsidy scheme run by BAMF, as compared with 10,358 the year before, a BAMF spokeswoman told newspapers from the Funke media group.

The BAMF scheme aims to encourage refugees to return to their homelands or go to other countries willing to accept them by paying for flights and providing €1,000 ($1,186) in start-up money per adult and €500 per child or minor.

The growth in the number of returnees is attributed largely to the fact that the subsidy became available again for Syrian refugees in January 2025, after having been stopped for some time because of the civil war in their country.

BAMF said 5,976 people had applied to leave Germany for Syria under the scheme by the end of December 2025, of whom 3,678 had already departed.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has kicked off a tour of Southeast Asia and the Pacific region with a visit to the city-state of Singapore.

There, he was due to hold talks with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and his counterpart Vivian Balakrishnan.

He is also scheduled to give a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

In 2024, Germany and Singapore agreed to an action plan specifically focusing on future technologies.

The EU and the city-state are also parties to a free trade agreement that came into force in 2019.

More than 2,000 companies from Germany have operations in Singapore, which is a leading financial, technology and logistics hub in the region.

Wadephul's trip comes as Germany continues its drive to diversify its range of international partners amid dwindling confidence in the US as a reliable ally.

Many bus, trams and underground services in Germany will not be operating on Monday amid a nationwide strike by the trade union Verdi.

Millions of employees and schoolchildren who rely on public transport will be forced to find alternative methods of getting to work or school, with wintry weather conditions adding to their problems.

All 16 German states bar one, Lower Saxony, where employees have agreed not to strike for now, are to be initially affected by the industrial action, Verdi said.

Employees of national rail operator Deutsche Bahn (DB) will not be taking part in the strike, meaning that its train services are expected to run without restrictions.

""The suburban commuter trains in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart, Cologne, Nuremberg, Rhein-Main [the Frankfurt metropolitan area] and the regional and long-distance services of DB are not represented by Verdi as a company and are therefore not affected by the strike,"" DB said.

Verdi is demanding improvements to working conditions, including shorter working weeks and shifts and longer rest periods.

It is also calling for higher bonuses for nighttime and weekend shifts.

According to the union, negotiations are also taking place on higher wages and salaries in the states of Bavaria, Brandenburg, Saarland and Thuringia, and at the Hamburg underground network.

A warm guten Tag from DW's newsroom in Bonn at the start of another wintry week.

Many users of buses, trams and underground rail systems will be left out in the cold on Monday as members of the large Verdi trade union stage a strike affecting almost all German states.

The industrial action aims to pressure municipal authorities into granting public transport workers better working conditions.

Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is visiting Singapore at the start of a tour of Southeast Asia and the Pacific region that will also take him to New Zealand, Tonga and Australia in the course of the week.

India's defense boost was expected following the four-day conflict with Pakistan last May. The budget also highlights plans for seven high-speed rail corridors and rare earth corridors.

India is set to spend a record amount on infrastructure and defense, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told parliament on Sunday.

New Delhi plans to invest $133 billion (€112 billion) in infrastructure and $85 billion on defence — an increase of around 9% and 15%, respectively, compared to last year's budget.

The finance minister also announced that the government will scale up manufacturing across seven strategic sectors. They include pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, rare earth magnets, chemicals, capital goods, textiles and sports goods.

""India will continue to take confident steps towards Viksit Bharat (Developed India), balancing ambition with inclusion,"" said Sitharaman in her national budget speech for the 2026-2027 financial year.

This is the first Indian budget since US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods in August as punishment for buying Russian oil.

After the budget presentation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""India is not content with simply being the fastest-growing economy.""

""India wants to become the world's third-largest economy. This year's budget presents an ambitious roadmap to give new momentum to"" domestic manufacturing and self-reliance, Modi added.

The defence spending increase comes after a four-day conflict with Pakistan in May 2026 which saw the two neighbors making extensive use of drones as well as missile and artillery barrages.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the ""unprecedented"" hike would bolster India's armed forces with new fighter jets, drones, ships, submarines and other critical hardware. 

""It is in the best interest of the nation,"" he said, adding that the budget reflects Modi's vision of a self-reliant India and a developed India by 2047. 

The budget highlights plans for seven high-speed rail corridors connecting major economic hubs, including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and Chennai.

""In order to promote environmentally sustainable passenger systems, we will develop seven high-speed rail corridors between cities as growth connectors,"" said Sitharama.

She also unveiled a push to build ""rare earth corridors"" in four mineral-rich states in southern and eastern India — Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.

Data centers and artificial intelligence will also receive government support, according to the finance minister.

""I propose to provide a tax holiday till 2047 to any foreign company that provides cloud services to customers globally by using data center services from India,"" Sitharaman told the parliament.

A total of 23 converted warehouses could imprison up to 80,000 people, estimates suggest.

The Trump administration is purchasing warehouses across the U.S. with the intention of converting them into immigration jails as the White House expands its brutal immigration crackdown.

At least seven sites being looked at by the administration could be used to imprison 7,500 people or more, with some sites coming close to a 10,000-person figure.

All told, the 23 warehouse sites being considered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would imprison as many as 80,000 people if converted into immigration jails — and more if the administration fails to implement safe living standards. 

Eighteen states in total — including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Virginia — could be part of the project. The administration is likely paying hundreds of millions of dollars collectively for these buildings, and the price tag will likely reach into the billions with the added cost of converting them into prisons.

If the administration follows through with this plan, it will be the largest expansion of immigrant prisons in U.S. history. 

A post from DHS on X claims that the buildings they're purchasing “will not be warehouses — they will be well structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards.”

But experts believe it will be difficult to ensure the warehouses meet safety standards before agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and/or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) begin imprisoning people within their walls. Indeed, at least one of the warehouses being considered for purchase is reputed to be dangerous on hot weather days. 

Meanwhile, “regular detention standards” in facilities already operated by DHS are abusive and inhumane, human rights groups have pointed out. The Trump administration reopened a former state prison in Texas last year, for example, in order to imprison immigrant families, including young children. Conditions in that prison have been described as “horrible,” with water and food containing contaminants that could make people sick. 

The purchase and conversion of these buildings would be a major escalation of President Donald Trump's already deeply unpopular immigration crackdown, in which federal agents have terrorized communities across the U.S., often abducting people with pending asylum cases or who were set to receive green cards with no regard for their due process rights, and even detaining U.S. citizens. 

Some cities have sought to prevent the Trump administration from purchasing warehouses within their boundaries that could be used to imprison immigrants. In Kansas City, the city council voted last month in favor of a five-year moratorium that bans any detention facility from being established if it is not owned by the city itself. 

That ban could be challenged — the state legislature, for example, which is controlled by Republicans, could pass a bill nullifying local ordinances seeking to block the administration from buying these warehouses. The White House could also file a lawsuit claiming federal “supremacy clause” arguments.

But city leaders say they will not give up without a fight.

“I will use every tool at my disposal to fight this federally funded terrorist organization that is ICE,” Kansas City Councilman Jonathan Duncan said after the ordinance was passed. “While today's moratorium vote was a good first step to stopping this mass incarceration concentration camp from being built in our City, this fight is far from over. We will need to put public pressure on any business that thinks they can sell out our community for personal profit. That comes next.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

DENNIS ROSS is Counselor at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a Professor at Georgetown University. A former U.S. Envoy to the Middle East, he served in senior national security positions in the Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and Obama administrations.

DAVID MAKOVSKY is Director of the Koret Project on Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and Adjunct Lecturer of Middle East Studies at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.

 How to Limit Hamas's Influence and Ensure Israel's Compliance

 Dennis Ross and David Makovsky

Last month, the Trump administration announced the start of the second phase of its Gaza peace plan, which the UN Security Council endorsed in November. Phase one, which went into effect last October, produced an initial cease-fire and ultimately the return of all hostages alive and dead, the release of about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, and the resumption of humanitarian aid. Phase two mandates the creation of a technocratic Palestinian governing authority, the deployment of an international stabilization force, the disarmament of Hamas, the reconstruction of Gaza, and the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces. The success of phase two will depend on the disarmament of Hamas. If there is disarmament, there will be reconstruction and Israeli withdrawal. Without it, there will be neither. The success of phase two hinges on the answer to a central question: Can the conditions that produced years of terrorism and war truly be dismantled?

At present, there are effectively two Gazas that must be unified before a durable peace can take hold. Israel maintains control of what is known as the Green Zone, which is roughly 53 percent of the territory and is largely in the east. Hamas controls the so-called Red Zone, the remaining 47 percent, primarily in the western part of the strip. In a statement issued in October, Hamas formally agreed to “hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independent technocrats,” but it is far from clear that the group will lay down its arms and allow Gazans to build a future it does not dominate. Achieving that outcome will require multiple actors, led by the United States, to use their leverage.

U.S. President Donald Trump must make clear to three countries in particular—Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey—that they are expected to deliver disarmament or risk damaging their relationships with Washington. The heads of state of all three countries have joined Trump's Board of Peace and endorsed his Gaza peace plan. Each has influence over Hamas's finances, legitimacy, political standing, and internal cohesion. Together, they have the power to pressure Hamas to begin decommissioning its weapons. They can publicly condemn the group for blocking the reconstruction of Gaza, and they can threaten to deny its leaders the ability to continue operating in their countries.

If a process of disarmament takes hold, Trump's peace plan, including a pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, will begin to look less aspirational and more realistic. That may seem implausible today, but successful implementation of phase two would fundamentally alter the psychological and political landscape for both the Israelis and the Palestinians.

Conversely, if Hamas chooses not to disarm and Gaza does not reunify, the future looks bleak. At best, the territory will remain partitioned, with Gazans living under Hamas's tyranny or Israeli occupation. At worst, Gaza will once again become a war zone.

UN Security Council Resolution 2803 gives the Board of Peace exclusive authority over the governance of Gaza for the next two years, with the possibility of extension. The Board of Peace's executive committee will work closely with the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, which is made up of 15 Palestinian technocrats. The NCAG will manage day-to-day governance in both the Green and Red Zones. An International Stabilization Force will back a Palestinian police force that recently underwent training in Egypt and Jordan; together they will assume responsibility for law and order. (The number of countries and the exact mandate and rules of engagement for the ISF are not yet finalized.)

The fate of phase two hangs on what happens in the Hamas-controlled Red Zone. This area is crucial because it contains more than 95 percent of Gaza's population and most of its urban centers, with the notable exception of Rafah near the Egyptian border. The members of the NCAG, all of whom are from Gaza, have indicated that their mission is to bring stability and economic development to all of Gaza. Should they neglect the Red Zone, they will fail to consolidate their authority and credibility.

But for the NCAG to be able to work in the Red Zone, it will need security—and that cannot be guaranteed unless Hamas disarms and the ISF-backed Palestinian police force can operate unimpeded. In October, Hamas endorsed Trump's peace plan, but the group's leadership did not explicitly commit to disarmament, stating that certain unnamed issues (presumably disarmament among them) would be deferred until they can be “discussed within a comprehensive Palestinian national framework.” Perhaps that was meant to provide Hamas an out, but there should be no doubt about point 13 of Trump's peace plan: “All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt.” It is very clear that disarmament and demilitarization are required, and there will be monitoring to ensure it.

In theory, Hamas leaders should not be able to oppose the redevelopment and reconstruction of Gaza, since they have already indicated that they are prepared to relinquish administrative control to technocrats. Still, the danger is that Hamas will never entirely abandon control, the NCAG will never fully take charge, and the two will maintain an uneasy cohabitation indefinitely. Although Hamas claims it will not interfere with the NCAG's work, the history of the contemporary Middle East has repeatedly shown that those who control the weapons often control the outcomes.

For its part, Israel will not withdraw to the perimeter of Gaza and permit reconstruction, as it is obliged to do eventually under the terms of Trump's cease-fire plan, unless Hamas first disarms. Without disarmament, there can be no reconstruction, in part because Israelis fear that Hamas will divert materials such as cement, wiring, and steel to rebuild its tunnel system, where it stored and produced the bulk of its weapons, and in part because the Saudis and Emiratis have made clear that they will not invest in reconstruction if Hamas is not disarmed.

At a televised cabinet meeting in January, Trump expressed optimism, saying that “it looks like they're going to disarm.” His envoy Steve Witkoff added, “They will because they have no choice. . . . They're going to give up their AK-47s.” According to U.S. and other officials, Qatar and Turkey have recently conveyed to Washington that Hamas will, in fact, begin a process of decommissioning their weapons.

Israeli officials do not share the Trump administration's optimism. They point to Hamas's ideological commitment to rejecting Israel's right to exist. And although a senior Israeli official conceded that Hamas might stage a symbolic gesture, perhaps decommissioning a limited number of heavy weapons, he insisted that the group will never relinquish its ability to reassert control by force. Moussa Abu Marzouk, a veteran senior official of Hamas, seemed to validate the Israeli view in an interview in Al Jazeera in late January, declaring that Hamas had not agreed to disarm. He said such a commitment “never happened,” adding that “not for a single moment did we talk about the surrender of weapons.”

Standing beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago several weeks ago, Trump warned that it would be “horrible, horrible” for Hamas if it did not disarm. Trump has from time to time threatened to impose a deadline on Hamas to disarm. If he follows through on that threat and the group fails to decommission its weapons, Israel will have the green light from Washington to act militarily.

The United States and Israel agree on disarming Hamas but disagree on how to do so. Netanyahu doubts that disarmament can happen peacefully. Trump is at least willing to test the proposition. If Trump does announce a deadline, with the implication of renewed Israeli military action, that will make clear to Hamas's leadership (and everyone else) that there is a limit to Washington's patience.

For Trump's preferred approach to work, Washington will have to lean on Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey. Each of these countries has significant bilateral interests with the United States, and each has been keen to show Trump that maintaining good relations serves the United States' interests. The U.S. president appears to share that desire. He has approved the inclusion of Qatar and Turkey, whose negotiators helped secure the release of Israeli hostages, in the Board of Peace's executive committee, over Netanyahu's opposition. (Israel opposed their inclusion because of their long-standing support for Hamas.)

Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey also have the means to pressure Hamas to disarm. Egypt controls Hamas's access to Gaza through the Rafah crossing. Hamas officials and their families live in Qatar with impunity guaranteed by Trump after Israel's failed strike in September. Qatar can threaten to expel them and deny them access to their bank accounts—and Turkey can make clear it will not take them. The three countries can use their individual and collective leverage on Hamas, impressing on the group that if it does not disarm (and allow the NCAG to begin rebuilding in the enclave), the fault will lie with Hamas's leadership. They will need to insist that the group not only decommission its weapons but also provide maps of their tunnels, so that this infrastructure could be destroyed.

They must pressure Hamas to surrender its weapons to either the ISF or the NCAG's police contingents. Disarmament should begin with heavy weapons that directly threaten Israel: rockets, mortars, antitank missiles, machine guns, and rocket-propelled grenades. Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has said that decommissioning will also involve buy-back provisions and amnesty for those who turn over their weapons. Crucially, the group's AK-47s must be included in any disarmament process, lest Hamas maintain its means of coercion over the Gazan population and prevent the new ISF-backed Palestinian security forces from ensuring basic law and order.

Israel, too, will need to play a constructive role in implementing phase two, and that starts with permitting the NCAG to operate and facilitating the rapid entry of aid, especially prefabricated housing and medical supplies. Beyond that, if Hamas engages in a credible disarmament process, Israel must permit reconstruction to begin at least in the places in the Red Zone where disarmament has taken place. Eventually, as Hamas demonstrates significant progress on disarmament, Israel will have to pull back its forces in accordance with Trump's peace plan.

Just as the disarming of Hamas will unfold in stages, so, too, will Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu will be skewered within his coalition and beyond if he is seen as withdrawing before disarmament, facing accusations that he has left Israel vulnerable after a sustained military effort. Knowing that any withdrawal is likely to cost him his coalition and require him to go to early elections, he is likely to resist Trump. But the fact is, he cannot easily say no to the president.

Trump has already demonstrated his ability to apply leverage to Netanyahu. In June, he insisted that Netanyahu recall aircraft midflight to preserve the cease-fire that ended Israel's 12-day war with Iran. In September, after a failed Israeli attempt to assassinate Hamas officials in Doha, Trump secured Israel's acceptance of his peace plan and compelled Netanyahu to apologize for the attack to Qatar's prime minister in a phone call from the Oval Office. And last month, he overrode Netanyahu's opposition to include the Turkish foreign minister and a senior Qatari official on the executive committee of the Board of Peace. Increasingly, it appears that Netanyahu cannot afford to defy Trump—especially after repeatedly calling him Israel's greatest friend and with elections looming.



Even so, Israel will not withdraw any farther than it has already before there is meaningful progress on Hamas's disarmament. That is why Trump must reach an understanding with Netanyahu on what would constitute meaningful progress—and if Hamas does indeed voluntarily disarm, Trump must hold Netanyahu to his own commitment to pull back.

Ultimately, the question is whose clock is ticking with a greater sense of urgency. Israel has made clear that if voluntary disarmament fails, military action will follow. Israeli officials privately speak of March—six months after the cease-fire—as a decision point. That gives Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey limited time to push Hamas to begin a real disarmament process. If Trump wants the cease-fire he has achieved in Gaza not only to endure but to also evolve into something more durable, he will have to apply sustained leverage—on Hamas, on Israel, and on the regional states that have influence.

Leverage, like any strategic asset, erodes if it is not used to produce concrete outcomes. The coming weeks will show whether diplomacy can shrink and ultimately eliminate Hamas's zone of control, avert another war, and catalyze a transformation in Gaza. If Trump wants the Board of Peace to act in other conflicts, he will first need to show that it has succeeded in Gaza.

 The Latest Military Purge Signals China's Leader Is Entering a New Era 

 Jonathan A. Czin and John Culver

The January 24 purge of Zhang Youxia, China's top general, was a Shakespearean moment in Chinese politics. Even after a decade of high drama in the People's Liberation Army, the decision by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to remove Zhang from the PLA's top governing body, the Central Military Commission (CMC), suggests a new level of intrigue. Xi and Zhang have known each other for decades: Xi's father and Zhang's father were comrades-in-arms during China's ferocious civil war, and Zhang was widely seen as Xi's closest ally in the army's high command. As recently as 2022, after a flurry of purges of other senior leaders, Xi not only allowed Zhang to stay in office past the unofficial retirement age but also promoted him to the top position for a military officer. A relationship that long and deep is valuable in any setting, but especially in the vicious, low-trust world of Chinese politics.

Zhang's dismissal is thus the ultimate illustration of just how little trust Xi has in the PLA. As we argued in our August 2025 essay on Xi's efforts to remake the military, “Xi wants to ensure he can employ violence with confidence, but Xi's confidence seems to be the rarest and most precious commodity for an otherwise well-resourced military.” But Zhang's unceremonious dismissal also illustrates the depths of Xi's ruthlessness in managing the PLA. It is one thing for a leader to show no mercy to his enemies; it is quite another for him to be so pitiless with his friends.

There is a lot of speculation about what Zhang did—or didn't do—to provoke Xi's ire as well as what the purge means for the Chinese leader's grasp on power and his military objectives vis-à-vis Taiwan and the United States. While those elements of the saga may reveal themselves in time, what is clear now is Xi's belief that power exists in its exercise. In making a public spectacle of pushing Zhang aside, Xi has laid bare a defining feature of his political style. No one is safe—not even those with deep personal connections to Xi. As PLA Daily, the military's official periodical, stated the day after Zhang's ouster, Xi's campaign has “no off-limit zones.” Even by the standards of Xi's unsparing rule, this is a seismic shift in Chinese politics.

The outstanding question for many observers is why Xi made this move against Zhang now. In its official account, PLA Daily declared that Zhang was removed for fueling “political and corruption problems that threaten the party's absolute leadership over the armed forces and undermine the party's governance foundation,” and his actions “caused immense damage to the construction of combat capabilities.” Given that corruption in the PLA is endemic, these claims are rightly seen by many outside observers as a pretext for removing Zhang rather than the true cause. This is especially true since Zhang previously ran the Equipment Development Department (formerly the General Armaments Department), which is responsible for procuring military supplies and is riddled with graft; as we highlighted in August, it was remarkable—and a sign of Xi's faith in him—that Zhang had not been purged since several previous leaders of the department had already fallen.

The timing of the removal becomes more interesting when you consider that Xi could have easily waited until next year to let Zhang retire peacefully. After all, Zhang, who is 75 years old, is already past the unofficial retirement age of 68, and the next Chinese Communist Party Congress—which ushers in a new cohort of Chinese officials every five years—is only around 18 months away. Removing Zhang now thus looks and feels very similar to the political flex that Xi made at the last party congress in 2022, when he had his predecessor, Hu Jintao, publicly and forcibly escorted from the proceedings while Xi looked on impassively. Xi's eviction of Hu—as well as his decision to force the rump remnants of Hu's faction into an early retirement—seemed gratuitous at the time; Xi had already effectively marginalized Hu's power base by either usurping his supporters' authority or relegating them to inconsequential positions, and centralizing power in his own hands. But in the end, Xi's moves signaled his desire for complete dominance of Chinese politics—and his ability to populate the uppermost echelons of the party with men he had known for decades, including Zhang.



The other intriguing element of the official rationale for Zhang's removal was that it was not just for corruption but also for “political” problems that could affect the party's control over the military. Some have read this to mean that Zhang intentionally flouted or challenged Xi's rule. Although this is a possibility, it is unlikely given their long-standing relationship. Moreover, if Zhang posed a political challenge to Xi, Zhang probably would have been the first to go down in the most recent anticorruption push, which got underway in 2023, rather than the last.

Given the paranoid streak in Chinese politics, it is always possible that Xi may have merely suspected that Zhang posed some kind of challenge to his power. If that is the case, it raises questions about whether Xi is succumbing to the pervasive and damaging suspicion that afflicts so many other dictators. But Xi has a long and well-documented history of hardhearted rationality. He does not generally act without reason. It is more likely that Zhang simply outlived his usefulness to Xi. Having relied on Zhang to consolidate his own power in the PLA and eliminated most of Zhang's generational cohort, Xi may have calculated that it no longer made sense to keep an aging and corrupt officer in the top job.

In this way, Zhang's purge should be seen as the climax in a longer drama. The ouster, after all, did not occur in a vacuum. For more than a decade, Xi has endeavored to puncture the military's insularity, assert his control, and bend the organization to his will. Zhang's removal seems to be the culmination of Xi's campaign not just to extirpate corruption from the PLA high command but also cull nearly an entire generation of senior officers from service. Xi seems to have concluded that virtually none of the military leaders in the current leadership generation were up to the twin tasks he had set for them: ensuring that the military is thoroughly politicized and thus willing to fulfill its role as the ultimate guarantor of party rule should it be challenged by internal unrest; and building a military that can fight foreign adversaries if he needs it to, including the U.S. military.

The result is that of the seven members who were on the CMC at the start of Xi's third term in 2023, only one uniformed member and one civilian (Xi) are left standing. Tellingly, the lone military survivor is the officer responsible for overseeing corruption investigations; he was promoted to vice chairman last fall amid a different wave of military purges. The virtually wholesale removal of the commission's leadership now affords Xi a blank slate. Ahead of next year's party congress, he can both repopulate and even restructure the commission, choosing not only who will serve but also which parts of the military are represented.

Xi has already done this kind of overhaul once: a decade ago, he renovated and streamlined the high command, in part by kicking the service chiefs off the CMC. Xi could make additional tweaks this time around, or he may have concluded that the effort to reform the PLA has failed and that the PLA cannot reform itself. Given the dearth of senior officers left, he has fewer options for replenishing the top ranks. He may instead install more civilians on the commission—traditionally, a second civilian is installed only when he becomes the heir apparent—which would help cement party control of the military.

Xi's desire to revamp the PLA goes far beyond corruption or effectiveness. Just months after Xi joined the CMC as a vice chairman in the fall of 2010, the Arab Spring unfolded, and he watched several authoritarian regimes collapse because their security services put their own interests above the ruling party's. Breaking the military's capacity to resist the party's commands, especially in a crisis, is of utmost importance to Xi—even more so than ensuring combat readiness. His driving concerns about party control of the military are not just operational; they are existential.

Xi's willingness to strip the high command down to its studs and renovate it at this moment is also a signal that he is relatively comfortable with China's external environment—especially the cross-strait dynamic. The Trump administration does not seem to be especially ready to defend Taiwan: U.S. President Donald Trump said “it's up to Xi” what China does regarding Taiwan, and the National Defense Strategy released by his administration last month omitted any mention of Taiwan. Meanwhile, the political dynamic in Taiwan seems to be shifting in Beijing's favor ahead of the island's next national election in 2028. Support for Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te and his Democratic Progressive Party, which takes a harder line against Beijing, has declined since its failed effort last summer to recall legislators in the opposition party, the Kuomintang, and a new leadership in the Kuomintang is calling for more reconciliation with Beijing.

But cutting this deeply into his own network to excise the rot in the PLA does not indicate that Xi is distracted from the possibility of military conflict over Taiwan. Instead, it shows just how serious he is about ensuring that the military is ready for such an unwelcome eventuality. He is taking advantage of the cross-strait calm to prepare. And as the PLA's major military drills around Taiwan in December demonstrated, China can already respond to provocations and even inflict punishment on the island short of an invasion. It has built a significant lethal force that could respond in a variety of ways if called on.

Who, exactly, will field the call, should Xi make it, is a mystery for now. But whenever he names a civilian to the CMC, that person will be seen as the de facto front-runner to succeed Xi as China's next leader, thus injecting a new character into this swirling drama. It is worth remembering that Xi began his anticorruption campaign around 2012 after the downfall of Bo Xilai, who had been his rival to succeed Hu Jintao. In its lurid details, that case evoked an airport novel: Bo's wife had murdered a British businessman who had been a fixer for the family. Although we do not yet know what operatic feuds or basic miscalculations led to Zhang's demise, his ouster is a reminder about the folly of applying algebraic logic to the dramatis personae of China's political hierarchy. There are likely to be many more acts in this unfolding play. The real question for Xi is whether he can author the denouement that so far seems to have eluded him: a military that lives up to his unforgiving standards of party loyalty and operational proficiency.

            An Australian snowboarder has died on a trip with friends to Japan after her backpack became caught in a ski lift leaving her suspended in midair, according to Japanese police and the lift operator.
    


            Nagano Omachi Police said the 22-year-old tourist suffered from cardiac arrest after the accident on Friday at the Tsugaike Mountain Resort in Hakuba Valley, a popular ski destination in central Japan.
    


            The woman was rushed to a hospital but later succumbed to her injuries, according to police and the ski lift operator.
    


            In a statement, the Tsugaike Gondola Lift Co. said the waist buckle of the tourist's backpack became entangled in the lift chair, which prevented her from getting off the lift.
    


            “Because the chest strap of the backpack was fastened, the backpack did not detach from the guest's body, and the guest was dragged along with the backpack after disembarking from the lift,” the company's CEO and director Kubo Tsuneo said in a statement.
    


            “A staff member immediately pressed the emergency stop button to halt lift operations. Emergency assistance was promptly provided, and the guest was then transported to a hospital by ambulance,” the statement said.
    


            The company expressed its “deepest condolences to the bereaved family” and vowed to strengthen safety measures.
    


            Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that an Australian citizen had died in Japan, and said it was providing consular support to their family.
    


            “We send our deepest condolences to the family at this difficult time,” a department spokesperson said in a statement.
    


            Japan is considered one of Asia's top snow sports destinations due to its powder snow, which attracts a large number of foreign tourists each winter.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Trevor Noah once again roamed through the audience during his monologue to open the Grammy Awards, taking pokes at the stars while standing right next to them, but he saved his most pointed jokes for absentees, and elicited an angry post from the president.

“ Nicki Minaj is not here,” Noah said, to big cheers from the audience at Crypto.com Arena. “She is still at the White House with Donald Trump discussing very important issues.” 

Minaj this week visited and praised the president, the culmination of a move toward MAGA that she's made in recent months. 

Noah broke into a Trump impression. “Actually Nicki, I have the biggest ass, everybody's saying it Nicki.”

In his sixth time hosting the show — and what he says will be his last — Noah mostly played it safe during his monologue, not delving too much into much politics or controversy, at least during his monologue. There was no mention of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (on a night when many attendees were wearing “ICE OUT” buttons). 

But Noah got more pointed later in the show, after Billie Eilish won song of the year. 

“Wow. That is a Grammy that every artist wants,” Noah said, “almost as much as Trump wants Greenland. Which makes sense. I mean, because Epstein's island is gone, he needs a new island to hang out with Bill Clinton.”

After the show in a Truth Social post, Trump reacted. 




“Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!! I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory, statement, have never been accused being there, not even by the Fake News Media,” the post said. “Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast. It looks like I'll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C.” 

After the crowd's reaction to the joke during the show, Noah said, “Oh, I told you, it's my last year. What are you going to do about it?”

At a different point in the show, Noah joked about the president's penchant for suing TV networks when he said the Grammys were airing “completely live” because “if we edited any of the show, the president would sue CBS for $16 billion,” referring to Trump's recent history with CBS News and a settlement he got from Paramount last summer.

It had seemed at first like he wasn't going to go very far into such material. 

He said during the monologue Lauryn Hill was performing on the show for the first time since 1999. 

“Do you understand how long ago that is?” he said. “Back in 1999, the president had had a sex scandal, people thought computers were about to destroy the world, and Diddy was arrested.” 

Later in the show, Noah cozied up to the night's biggest nominee, Kendrick Lamar, and only congratulated him. 

“I actually thought about writing a few jokes roasting you, but then I remembered what you can do to light-skinned dudes from other countries,” Noah, who is from South Africa, said in a reference to Lamar's beef with the Canadian rapper Drake that culminated in last year's big Grammy winner “Not Like Us.” 

Later, he sat with Bad Bunny, and asked if he could come live with him in his native Puerto Rico if things got too bad in the U.S.

“Trevor I have some news for you,” Bad Bunny said. “Puerto Rico is part of America.” 

The Recording Academy announced less than three weeks ago that Noah was returning “one final time.” 

“I believe in term limits,” Noah said during the show. 

Only singer Andy Williams, who hosted the Grammys seven times in the 1970s, has hosted more often.

Noah himself is a four-time Grammy nominee, and was up this year in the best audio book recording category for “Into The Uncut Grass,” a children's story. He lost to the Dalai Lama.

Entertainment's awards season has coincided with the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign in Minneapolis, forcing artists to decide whether and how to join the growing cultural revolt against immigration crackdowns.

Pushback from music's biggest stars was visible Sunday from the Grammys red carpet and throughout the telecast. Activists spent the week pressing celebrities to don pins protesting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence in cities, working with their teams to spread the message and circulating them at the many events leading up to the ceremony.

Billie Eilish, Finneas and Carole King wore pins while appearing onstage. Even Justin and Hailey Bieber, who don't normally address American politics, had them. Eilish began her song of the year speech by professing that “no one is illegal on stolen land.” British soul pop singer Olivia Dean, recognized as best new artist, shared that she is the granddaughter of an immigrant — people who she said “deserve to be celebrated.” Expletives flew as ICE got cursed multiple times by winners including Kehlani.

“Before I say thanks to God, I'm gonna say: ICE out,” Bad Bunny said to great applause while accepting the award for best música urbana album. “We're not savage, we're not animals, we're not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.”

The frequent pushback and buttons' prevalence marked a much stronger showing of support than organizers saw at last month's Golden Globes. Public backlash has grown since a Border Patrol officer shot and killed 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti and federal agents detained 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos. The recent arrest of journalist Don Lemon, who attended Sunday's ceremony, only added to the outcry.




Plus, as one organizer noted, the Grammys tend to draw a less risk-averse crowd than Hollywood's shows.

“These are folks who are known for six-stage shows, crazy costumes, being kind of rebellious, punk rock — like that's the music industry. And so, I think it makes sense that we would see good support,” Maremoto Executive Director Jess Morales Rocketto said ahead of the show. “These pins are about so much more than a red carpet moment. It's about people taking a stand and doing what they can to show up to say that ICE should be out of our communities.”

Jason Isbell, Margo Price, Kehlani and Rhiannon Giddens were among the other artists wearing protest apparel on the Grammys red carpet.

Justin Vernon, whose band Bon Iver is up for best alternative music album, said he wore a whistle to honor the legal observers who are documenting federal agents' actions on the streets.

“I think there's a reason that music exists and it's to heal and to bring people together,” he told The Associated Press. “But the real work are those observers on the on the ground in Minneapolis. We just want to want to shout them out.”

Earlier in the week, Mexican American singer Becky G had an explicit message for ICE on the nails she wore to the MusiCares Person of the Year gala. And at the Sundance Film Festival, several celebrities wore pins saying “ICE OUT” during their red carpet appearances, including Natalie Portman, Olivia Wilde and Zoey Deutch, who also wore a “BE GOOD” pin, referencing Renee Good, who was killed by an ICE officer last month.

Wilde told the AP that she was “horrified by this string of murders that we are somehow legitimizing and normalizing.”

“It's really difficult to be here and to be celebrating something so joyous and beautiful and positive when we know what's happening on the streets,” she added. “Americans are out on the streets marching and demanding justice, and we're there with them. And if we can do anything with our platforms, you know, we can speak out and demand that ICE get out.”

Portman got emotional when asked about her “ICE OUT” pin at the premiere of her new film, “The Gallerist.” 

“I'm so lucky to be here in a joyful, creative community celebrating a movie we're really proud of. But it's impossible to ignore what ICE is doing to our country. And I'm very inspired, though, by all of the amazing, amazing Americans who are coming out and supporting each other and being there in communities. It's beautiful,” the actor said as she teared up.

As far as the Grammys go, Morales Rocketto, the community organizer who founded the Latino advocacy group Maremoto, said it's “kind of a crapshoot” as to which entertainers actually wear the pins.

She described a range of industry forces working against artists' political expression. Objections could come from record companies, managers or corporate partners.

“Maybe the design house that did their fashion deal for the red carpet didn't want them to literally poke holes in the dress,” she said. “There's like a million reasons for people not to do it.”

Artists might also face personal dangers themselves. Morales Rocketto pointed to the Trump administration's threats to place ICE agents at the upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance by Bad Bunny, “one of the most invincible” entertainers in her view.

“I wouldn't be surprised if we see some Latino artists wearing them,” she said of the pins. “But the reality is that just because Latino artists are rich and famous, doesn't mean that they are exempt from the lack of safety that permeates so many Latinos and Latino families. They themselves may be undocumented or only have a green card or have mixed status families.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A top Justice Department official played down the possibility of additional criminal charges arising from the Jeffrey Epstein files, saying Sunday that the existence of “horrible photographs” and troubling email correspondence does not “allow us necessarily to prosecute somebody.”

Department officials said over the summer that a review of Epstein-related records did not establish a basis for new criminal investigations, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that position remains unchanged even as a massive document dump since Friday has focused fresh attention on Epstein's links to powerful individuals around the world and revived questions about what, if any, knowledge the wealthy financier's associates had about his crimes.

“There's a lot of correspondence. There's a lot of emails. There's a lot of photographs. There's a lot of horrible photographs that appear to be taken by Mr. Epstein or people around him,” Blanche said Sunday on CNN's “State of the Union.” “But that doesn't allow us necessarily to prosecute somebody.”

He said victims of Epstein's sex abuse “want to be made whole,” but that “doesn't mean we can just create evidence or that we can just kind of come up with a case that isn't there.”

President Donald Trump's Justice Department said Friday that it would be releasing more than 3 million pages of documents and more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images under a law intended to reveal most of the material it collected during long-running investigations into Epstein.




The fallout from the release of the files has been swift. 

In the United Kingdom, Lord Peter Mandelson announced his resignation from the governing Labour Party on Sunday following further revelations about his relationship with Epstein. He said he was stepping aside to avoid causing “further embarrassment,” even as he denied allegations he had received payments from Epstein two decades ago.

A top official in Slovakia, meanwhile, left his position after photos and emails revealed he had met with Epstein in the years after Epstein was released from jail. And British Prime Minister Keir Starmer suggested that longtime Epstein friend Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, should tell U.S. investigators whatever he knows about Epstein's activities.

The files posted to the department's website included documents involving Epstein's friendship with Mountbatten-Windsor, along with Epstein's email correspondence with onetime Trump adviser Steve Bannon, New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch and other prominent contacts with people in political, business and philanthropic circles, such as billionaires Bill Gates and Elon Musk.

The Epstein saga has long fueled public fascination in part because of his past friendships with Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Both men have said they had no knowledge Epstein was abusing underage girls.

Among the records was a spreadsheet created last August that summarized calls made to the FBI's National Threat Operation Center or to a hotline set up by prosecutors from people claiming to have some knowledge of wrongdoing by Trump. That document included a range of uncorroborated stories involving different celebrities, and somewhat fantastical scenarios, occasionally with notations indicating what follow-up, if any, was done by agents.

Blanche said Sunday that there were a “ton of people” named in the files besides Trump and that the FBI had fielded “hundreds of calls” about prominent individuals where the allegations were “quickly determined to not be credible.”

Some of Epstein's personal email correspondence contained candid discussions with others about his penchant for paying women for sex, even after he served jail time for soliciting an underage prostitute. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail in August 2019, a month after being indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.

In one 2013 email, a person whose name was blacked out wrote to Epstein about his choice “to surround yourself with these young women in a capacity that bleeds — perhaps, somewhat arbitrarily — from the professional into the personal and back.”

“Though these women are young, they are not too young to know that they are making a very particular choice in taking on this role with you,” the person wrote. “Especially in the aftermath of your trial which, after all, was public and could be — indeed was — interpreted as a powerful man taking advantage of powerless young women, instead of the other way around.”

In a 2009 email, not long after Epstein had finished serving jail time for his Florida sex crime, another woman, whose name was redacted, excoriated him for breaking a promise that they would spend time alone together and try to conceive a baby.

“I find myself having to question every agreement we have made (no prostitutes staying in the house, in our bed, movies, naps, two weeks Alone, baby...),” She wrote. “Your last minute suggestion to spend THIS weekend with prostitutes is just too much for me to handle. I can't live like this anymore.”

Blanche said in a separate appearance on ABC's “This Week” that though there are a “small number of documents” the Justice Department was waiting for a judge's approval before it can release, when it comes to the department's own scouring of documents, “this review is over.”

“We reviewed over six million pieces of paper, thousands of videos, tens of thousands of images,” Blanche said.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday that he believed the Justice Department was complying with the law requiring disclosure of the files.

But Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a co-sponsor of the law, said he did not believe the department had fully complied. He said survivors were upset some of their names had inadvertently come out without redactions.

Blanche said each time the department has learned a victim's name was not properly redacted, it has moved quickly to fix the problem and that those mistakes account for a tiny fraction of the overall materials.

NEW YORK (AP) — Wild swings that swept through financial markets overnight eased as trading headed westward to Wall Street on Monday. U.S. stocks rose following sharp drops in Asia and then gains in Europe, while gold and silver prices rallied back from severe earlier losses.

The S&P 500 added 0.6% and is on track to snap a three-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 439 points, or 0.9%, as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.8% higher.

Stocks of companies that make computer storage helped lead the market, adding to gains from last week following several profit reports that topped analysts' expectations. Airlines and cruise-ship operators were also strong, benefiting from a sharp easing of oil prices. 

The center of the action in financial markets was again precious metals, where momentum has suddenly halted after gold's price had roughly doubled in just 12 months.

Gold briefly dropped below $4,500 per ounce in the overnight hours, down more than $1,000 from its high point reached just last week. It later erased its loss since Friday, before pulling back to $4,730.50, down 0.3%.

Silver's price has been on an even wilder ride recently, and it swung from a 9% loss overnight to a gain of 1.2%.

Gold and silver prices had been surging as investors looked for safer things to own amid a wide range of worries, including a Federal Reserve that may be set to become less independent, a U.S. stock market that critics say is expensive, threats of tariffs and heavy debt loads for governments worldwide.




Their prices cratered on Friday, including a 31.4% plunge for silver. Some on Wall Street saw it as a result of President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next chair of the Fed. Warsh's reputation as a former Fed governor may have raised expectations among some investors that he may keep interest rates high to fight against inflation, which would reduce the need to hide out in gold and silver for protection.

But many on Wall Street are also skeptical of that initial reading and say the expectation from Trump is likely that Warsh will cut interest rates, something the president has been demanding. That could give the economy a boost, but also inflation.

The Fed chair has a big influence on the economy and markets worldwide by helping to dictate where the U.S. central bank moves interest rates. That affects prices for all kinds of investments, as the Fed tries to keep the U.S. job market humming without letting inflation get out of control.

The recent swoons for gold and silver are likely more about the washout for some traders who had borrowed money to bet on metals' prices continuing to soar, rather than about a wholesale change in expectations for demand for metals, according to Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wealth & Investment Management at Wells Fargo 

On Wall Street, Sandisk leaped 15% to lead the S&P 500. The data-storage company added to its 6.9% gain from Friday, after it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It credited demand created by the artificial-intelligence boom, among other things. 

That helped offset a 1.1% drop for Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world's move into AI technology. The losses were worse in Asia, where AI winners plunged. South Korea's Kospi fell 5.3% from its record for its worst day in almost 10 months after chip company SK Hynix lost nearly 9%.

The Walt Disney Co. fell 4.2% even though the entertainment giant reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It warned of challenges keeping international visitors away from its U.S. theme parks, among other things. 

Oil prices dropped more than 4% after Trump told reporters that Iran is “seriously talking to us.” It's a potential signal of improving relations between the two countries, which could prevent a possible disruption to the global flow of oil.

That could mean less painful fuel bills for airlines and cruise ships. Carnival steamed 7% higher, and United Airlines climbed 4.8%.

In the bond market, Treasury yields edged higher after a report said that U.S. manufacturing grew last month, when economists were expecting a contraction. The yield on the 10-year Treasury erased an earlier dip and rose to 4.27%, up from 4.26% late Friday. 

In stock markets abroad, European indexes rose roughly 1% following Asia's washout. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.3%, while stocks fell 2.2% in Hong Kong and 2.5% in Shanghai.

Socialist New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani has outlined plans to scale back the city's Gifted and Talented program, prompting some education experts to warn that doing so could deprive high-achieving students, particularly those from low-income families, of critical academic opportunities.

Recent media reports indicate that Mamdani, who took office in January, intends to end the city's Gifted and Talented program for kindergarten students and delay entry until third grade, a move critics argue would amount to a major weakening of accelerated learning options in the nation's largest school district.

The plan is drawing sharp criticism from Defending Education, a national education watchdog group that previously fought, and won, a years-long legal battle to preserve New York's gifted programs after it was argued that the admissions system had discriminatory effects and reinforced racial inequities in education. 

""The Court of Appeals rightly concluded that the role of the judiciary is not to make education policy,"" Sarah Parshall Perry, vice president and legal fellow at Defending Education, told Fox News Digital, adding that the program complied with state education law and equal protection requirements.

But Perry warned that Mamdani's policy agenda could undo what the courts upheld.

""As we suspected he might, newly minted democratic socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani — himself, a product of expensive private schools — has pledged to shut down the gifted and talented program, despite the fact that it has helped countless students from humble backgrounds achieve their full academic potential,"" Perry told Fox News Digital. 

""Depriving kids of much-needed advanced learning opportunities is not only foolhardy, but it's also the height of hypocrisy coming from someone who was born into affluence and attended costly private schools. Apparently, Mamdani believes only the privileged should have access to various educational opportunities.""

Mamdani has argued that early gifted testing contributes to inequities in the school system, though critics counter that dismantling selective programs does little to improve outcomes for struggling students while actively harming high performers.

Paul Runko, senior director of strategic initiatives for K-12 programs at Defending Education, echoed Perry's concerns, emphasizing the impact such changes could have on working-class families.

""On behalf of parents who simply want the best possible education for their children, Defending Education spent years in court fighting to preserve New York City's gifted and talented programs against efforts to use the courts to inject race into every aspect of the school system,"" Runko said.

""Those efforts may succeed if Mayor Zohran Mamdani moves forward with eliminating these accelerated learning opportunities,"" he warned. ""Students, particularly those from lower-income families who benefit from NYC's gifted and talented programs, deserve opportunities for academic excellence, not a one-size-fits-all approach that could weaken learning for all students.""

Mamdani's office pushed back on Defending Education's characterization, telling Fox News Digital that the administration opposes testing five-year-olds for gifted and talented programs but is not eliminating advanced learning opportunities across all grade levels. 

Mamdani's office said the focus is instead on reshaping the public school system to provide ""rigorous"" instruction for all students, rather than separating children at an early age.

Mamdani faced heated criticism from his opponents in the mayoral race regarding his plans to change the program, as well as from the Washington Post editorial board in October.

""Who could have guessed that Zohran Mamdani (D), the leading candidate to become the next New York mayor, would provoke a firestorm by announcing this week that he intends to phase out the city's early elementary school programs for gifted students in the name of equity? Parents of bright children want access to schooling that meets their needs?"" The Post wrote. ""Shocking.""

Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner drew backlash after vowing to ""hunt down"" ICE agents during a City Hall event tied to new ""ICE OUT"" legislation. (Credit: WTXF)

Soros-backed Democratic prosecutor Larry Krasner is facing criticism for his inflammatory remarks against federal immigration enforcement, with a Republican lawmaker urging the Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation after Krasner said he would ""hunt down"" ICE agents.

Krasner, the district attorney for Philadelphia, took to the podium at Penn Square last week to denounce ICE agents as ""a small bunch of wannabe Nazis,"" adding, ""if we have to hunt you down the way they hunted down Nazis for decades, we will find your identities.""

House Intelligence Committee member Greg Steube, R-Fla., called out Krasner and recommended that Attorney General Pam Bondi take a closer look at his ever-escalating remarks on the issue.

Steube cited federal code categorizing threatening a federal officer as a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

FEDERAL PROSECUTORS OPEN INVESTIGATION INTO WALZ, FREY OVER ALLEGED IMPEDING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

""The DOJ should absolutely arrest and convict this guy,"" he said.

Krasner previously said he would seek to arrest and prosecute federal agents who ""come to Philly to commit crimes"" — in an apparent reference to allegations that law enforcement acted unlawfully when shooting a Minnesota woman who appeared to intentionally hit one of them with her car while disrupting an operation.

In the remarks that drew Steube's ire, Krasner boasted that the 350 million Americans who live in the U.S. outnumber the ""small bunch of wannabe Nazis"" before offering to work with other states' prosecutors to pursue them criminally after President Donald Trump's term ends.

TRUMP-ERA ICE AGENTS TARGETED FOR ‘IMMORALITY' BY DEM TRYING TO BLACKLIST THEM FROM COP, CLASSROOM JOBS

Fox News Digital reached out to the Justice Department to ask whether it planned to follow Steube's recommendation, but received no response. A White House official who was asked about the situation directed Fox News Digital back to the DOJ.

Krasner also earned a rebuke from his own party, as Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro told Fox News that such remarks are ""unacceptable… abhorrent and it is wrong; period; hard-stop; end of sentence.""

""We have a psychopath with a badge,"" fellow Pennsylvanian Rep. Dan Meuser, a Dallas Republican, said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

DHS SHARES OBSCENE, THREATENING VOICEMAIL SENT TO ICE AGENT, BLAMING LOCAL POLS FOR 'INCITEMENT'

Meuser condemned Krasner for repeatedly failing to prosecute actual violent criminals, citing a reported prosecution rate of 30% for such crimes.

""Every responsible Democrat must condemn this behavior. Failure to do so only increases the temperature in an already volatile situation, endangering federal law enforcement and communities alike,"" he said, adding that Senate Democrats are borrowing Krasner's ""reckless political playbook"" in using DHS funding as a cudgel in government-shutdown negotiations.

Meuser quipped that many critics rightly dub Krasner ""Let ‘Em Go Larry"" for his position toward prosecution of suspects who aren't members of federal immigration enforcement.

Meuser has been at the forefront of calling out prosecutors for their actions and statements, authoring the Holding Prosecutors Accountable Act, which would make district attorney offices that fail to prosecute at least two-thirds of arrests ineligible for certain Justice Department grants.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin was asked about Steube's call and said that Krasner's comments were ""vile.""

WHITE HOUSE BLAMES DEMOCRATS FOR ICE VIOLENCE AS MINNEAPOLIS ERUPTS, INSURRECTION ACT THREAT LOOMS

""He is intentionally stoking the flames of hatred and division in this country for political gain. Calling law enforcement Nazis and encouraging violence and doxing of them is absolutely disgusting,"" she said, citing the 1,300% increase in assaults against ICE.

""The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop,"" McLaughlin said, adding that Krasner should instead be thanking ICE for removing several dangerous illegal immigrants from the Delaware Valley itself.

She cited Yehi Badawi from Egypt, who was convicted of aggravated assault and robbery; Cuban national Alan De Armas-Tundidor, a convicted drug trafficker; and Thanh Long Huynh of Vietnam, who was convicted of both rape and cocaine distribution.

In recent comments to Fox News Digital, another top Pennsylvania Republican who taught relevant subjects at the U.S. Army War College, said the federal supremacy clause would likely moot any actions by Krasner or Philadelphia against ICE agents following lawful federal orders.

""The Constitution is not optional,"" said state Sen. Doug Mastriano of Gettysburg, who ran against Shapiro in 2022.

State Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee Chairman Jarrett Coleman, an Allentown Republican whose panel oversees local-state-federal interactions, told Fox News Digital earlier this month that claims Philadelphia officials can intercede with federal immigration enforcement are ""empty threats.""

DHS PUNCHES BACK AT MOULTON FOR 'INCITING RIOTERS' WITH 'GROSS' ICE REMARKS

""If they do obstruct federal law enforcement efforts, the Pennsylvania Senate will be the least of their worries,"" he said, later remarking that if Krasner paid more attention to actual violence, ""Philadelphia wouldn't be such a s---hole.""

Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, a far-left funder of many allegedly soft-on-crime prosecutors in localities around the country, dumped $1.7 million into Krasner's 2017 election, according to Philadelphia's PBS affiliate.

Philadelphia City Council Minority Leader Kendra Brooks, of the left-wing Working Families Party, and Democrat Rue Landau also authored legislation intended to limit ICE operations within city limits.

Speaker Mike Johnson said he would support judicial impeachments during his weekly House GOP leadership press conference.

A federal appeals court dismissed a Justice Department misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, according to court documents revealed this week.

Jeffrey S. Sutton, chief judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, dismissed the complaint on December 19, but news of the ruling only arrived this weekend. The DOJ alleged misconduct on the grounds that Boasberg had made comments at a judicial conference saying the Trump administration would trigger a ""constitutional crisis"" by disregarding federal court rulings.

His comments at the conference came just days before Boasberg issued an order blocking deportation flights.

Sutton argued that the government had failed to provide evidence of Boasberg's comments or sufficient context surrounding them.

""A recycling of unadorned allegations with no reference to a source does not corroborate them. And a repetition of uncorroborated statements rarely supplies a basis for a valid misconduct complaint,"" Sutton said in his ruling.

News of the ruling comes days after the White House confirmed its support for the Senate Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry involving Boasberg and another judge Republicans have described as an activist.

""Left-wing, activist judges have gone totally rogue,"" a White House official told Fox News Digital. ""They're undermining the rule of law in service of their own radical agenda. It needs to stop. And the White House fully embraces impeachment efforts.""

COURT SAYS BOASBERG DIDN'T KNOW ARCTIC FROST SUBPOENAS HIT LAWMAKERS, GRASSLEY CALLS THAT ‘DEEPLY TROUBLING'

The White House official continued that President Donald Trump must be able to ""lawfully implement the agenda the American people elected him on,"" arguing that judges who repeatedly issue partisan rulings have abused their offices and forfeited their claim to impartiality.

Boasberg has become a prime target for Republicans over a string of rulings tied to Trump-era immigration policies — including cases involving the Trump administration's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act law to deport Venezuelan migrants to CECOT in El Salvador.

More recently, he drew fresh GOP backlash after reports surfaced that he approved warrants in former special counsel Jack Smith's ""Arctic Frost"" probe that enabled investigators to seize phone records connected to some Republican lawmakers.

A top federal court official defended Boasberg from those accusations in December, however, saying that the judge would likely have been unaware that the gag orders were hiding subpoenas that were intended to target members of Congress.

Jurupa Valley High School graduate Hadeel Hazameh responded to the news that the Trump administration has launched a Title IX investigation into her district over an incident involving trans volleyball teammate.

After the historic Jan. 13 Supreme Court hearing on trans athletes in women's sports, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced 19 new investigations into educational entities suspected of violating Title IX.

Jurupa Unified School District (JUSD) in Riverside, California was at the very top of investigations that ED announced on Jan. 14. The second entity on the list was the neighboring district, the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District (PYLUSD). Their fates were intertwined amid a national controversy involving a trans athlete in 2025. 

Fox News Digital has obtained exclusive details related to the incidents being probed, via a public records request, and testimony from the young women who were impacted. Fox News Digital is not disclosing the name of the trans athlete in this specific story at the request of the athlete's mother when we reached out for comment. However, previously the mother and athlete have spoken out publicly and the athlete's name is widely reported and known.

Former Jurupa Valley High School girls' volleyball player Hadeel Hazameh spoke up in the fall about playing with a transgender teammate for the last three years, joining a lawsuit against her school district over it. 

The experience has been so traumatizing and difficult to navigate. Hazameh sped up her academics to graduate early so she wouldn't have to share the same hallways as her antagonists. Her last day of school was Dec. 19. She will no longer be competing in track and field this spring. 

""I was looking very forward to track… I really miss volleyball,"" Hazameh told Fox News Digital. 

Hazameh stepped away from her volleyball team in protest in early September, about a week before officially filing a lawsuit, led by the firm Advocates for Faith & Freedom, against JUSD. 

Hazameh said she always believed males shouldn't compete in women's sports, but she also cited her religious beliefs, as a practicing Muslim. She could not be in the same changing spaces as a biological male.

Then came the backlash. Hazameh said her volleyball teammates, except the co-plaintiff in the lawsuit, Alyssa McPherson, turned on her.

(Kirby Lee/Getty Images)

""After I went public with not supporting biological men in women's sports, of course, everyone doesn't like me anymore. The only friend I have is Alyssa. And it's okay, honestly. I don't need a lot of friends, I just need the ones that are there for me to support me,"" Hazameh said.

The treatment from peers even resulted in an alleged death threat from a classmate, who Hazameh alleges was reported to the school with no response.

""People are very disrespectful. I've been getting very disrespectful comments, I'll be walking to class and someone will cuss at me, or I'm pretty sure someone almost told me to die. And I reported it to the school and they didn't do anything about it,"" she added. 

""'They were like ‘what do you want me to do for you in this situation?' And I'm like, ‘someone just told me to die. Are you serious right now?'""

Hazameh added, ""I was like this is a repeating cycle with this same girl and I've seen no consequences. And yes, it was reported formally. I turned in the yellow slip, and it was sent to one of the receptionists,"" and that she eventually submitted a second slip alleging the issues. 

Jurupa Valley High School was unwillingly thrust into a national spotlight last May when President Donald Trump called out a situation involving a trans athlete at the school who competed for the girls' track and field team. The trans athlete advanced to the state final, prompting Trump to send a Truth Social post warning state officials to not let the athlete compete in the event.

On the last day of May, Jurupa's trans athlete went on to win state gold in the high jump and triple jump, and finished second in the long jump. 

Trump's Department of Justice then filed a Title IX lawsuit against the state in July for refusing to keep biological males out of girls' sports. 

When the fall sports season started back up, Jurupa's trans athlete returned for a fourth and final year of girls' volleyball.

But the 2025 season wouldn't go as smoothly. In addition to Hazameh and McPherson's protest and lawsuit, opposing teams began to forfeit, presumably in response to the sudden national awareness around the trans athlete. By the end of the regular season, at least 10 games on the schedule were forfeited.

Jurupa Valley High School and other schools that oversaw the forfeiting teams began to confirm publicly the games would not be played. 

A national media firestorm had arrived for the high school of 1,638 students. 

In early September, a representative from Gov. Gavin Newsom's office reached out to JUSD administrators, referencing California's ongoing legal battle against Trump over the issue of trans athletes in girls' sports, as seen in public records obtained by Fox News Digital. 

Newsom's Legal Affairs Secretary David Sapp sent an email to district administrators on Sept. 8 that appeared to include a copy of the state's motion to dismiss a lawsuit, filed by Trump's DOJ in July, over the CIF's continued policies that allow males in girls' sports. 

""As discussed, please see attached for a copy of the motion to dismiss that we filed on Friday in USDOJ's lawsuit around Title IX,"" Sapp's email wrote. 

The email was forwarded by one district administrator to others, to be discussed at a meeting on Sept. 12. The exchange also appeared to indicate school administrators recently discussed the issue with Sapp himself.

""You can let the team know that [JUSD administrator] & I received this from David Sapp with the Governor's office on Monday when discussing the issue with them and we're passing it along in case it is helpful for our discussion today,"" the email wrote. 

Fox News Digital requested minutes and transcripts from the Sept. 12 meeting that the administrator's email referenced from JUSD. The school district responded claiming it had no records it could share from the meeting. 

""The September 12 meeting attended by [JUSD administrator] was an informal teleconference, which included, among other attendees, the District's legal counsel. There were no minutes from the teleconference, and [JUSD administrator] did not take notes or create any documents,"" a JUSD administrator told Fox News Digital.

""Any notes or documents prepared by district legal counsel have not been shared with any other party and, as such, are covered by the attorney-client work privilege and attorney work-product doctrine.""

JUSD and Newsom's office have declined to provide any further clarity on the interactions between Sapp and the school district. 

INSIDE THE SCOTUS HEARING BOUND TO BE A TURNING POINT IN THE CULTURE WAR OVER TRANS ATHLETES IN WOMEN'S SPORTS

A source within Newsom's office provided a statement, on background, to Fox News Digital in response to an inquiry for clarification on Sapp's interaction with JUSD administrators. 

""On September 8, 2025, [JUSD] Superintendent [Trenton] Hansen and Dave Sapp spoke regarding the USDOJ lawsuit mentioned in your email, which includes allegations related to Jurupa USD. Dave followed up to share a copy of the State's Motion to Dismiss, which had been filed the week before and was otherwise publicly available. Dave did not give the district any directives or suggestions regarding its handling of the transgender athlete situation or related media interactions,"" the statement read. 

JUSD administrators kept a spreadsheet documenting media coverage of their volleyball situation, keeping track of the online stories being written and any correspondence with the journalists who wrote them.  

For the first 27 stories, published from Aug. 8 to Sept. 4, the spreadsheet states that either a statement was provided or no request was made. The district provided responses for 10 different stories, plus an on-air interview for CBS affiliate KCAL and an in-person interview for The Press Enterprise.

Then, on Sept. 6, for the first time, the district wrote in the spreadsheet that it chose not to respond to an inquiry. It was for a Fox News Digital story on Hazameh and McPherson stepping away from the team. 

From Sept. 6 to Jan. 14, the spreadsheet recorded 15 stories in which the district stated that it chose not to respond to an inquiry. The outlets who were not given responses include OutKick, Fox News Digital, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post and Newsweek.

A Sept. 20 email from a school spokesperson to a fellow administrator read, ""I think I can ignore this one?"" while forwarding an inquiry regarding forfeits from Fox News Digital. 

""FYI… I am ignoring this one,"" a school spokesperson wrote in an email to another administrator, forwarding a media inquiry about the forfeits from a reporter at The Christian Post on Oct. 20. 

A Sept. 25 email from KCBS2 and KCAL9 News inquiring about the forfeits was forwarded between administrators, with one writing, ""Update: He also left a voicemail wanting to confirm the forfeit. I'm planning to ignore.""

An Oct. 15 email read, ""I think we made the right choice by not responding,"" while forwarding a Fox News Digital article about one of the reported forfeits. The school did not respond to six inquiries for that particular story, as stated in the spreadsheet.

Jurupa administrators even spoke to each other about the forfeits that it declined to verify to the press. A Sept. 17 email between administrators referenced three forfeits from three opposing teams during a weekend tournament. One email read, ""They were this weekend at the Roosevelt Tournament,"" while forwarding a news article about the three forfeits.

""There were multiple teams that canceled but were less public because it was during tournament play,"" another email on the thread wrote.

JUSD confirmed a late September forfeit against Patriot High School – a school in their own district – to Fox News Digital. 

The spreadsheet states the district only responded to two total inquiries after Sept. 6, one being to confirm the Patriot forfeit to Fox News Digital, and the other to confirm the same thing to The Press Enterprise. 

Other than those two instances, JUSD did not respond to any other inquires after Sept. 6, per the spreadsheet.

The regular season came to an end in October. Jurupa Valley finished tied for first place in the River Valley League and were off to the CIF playoffs. 

That's when their paths would cross with students of PYLUSD — the other district near the top of the Trump admin's recent list of new Title IX investigation targets.

In May 2025, the PYLUSD board considered a resolution to limit girls' sports to ""biological females,"" but it failed on a 3-2 vote because, as noted by a school district representative, ""board resolutions cannot overrule state law.""

Then in October, a school within the PYLUSD, Valencia High School, was pitted against Jurupa Valley for the first round of the girls' volleyball state playoffs. 

Valencia's team opted to play the game. But two players on Valencia did not take the court that night. 

The parents of two female players for Valencia who chose not to play that night previously provided a joint statement, the parents say was written by the two girls, to Fox News Digital on the condition of anonymity.

""On October 18, our team was informed that we would be playing Jurupa Valley High School in Round 1 of CIF. When scouting the team, we quickly realized that they had a transgender player who we would be competing against on October 22. Ten other teams had previously forfeited against Jurupa, which alarmed our team and led us to consider whether we should play or not,"" the statement began.

""Due to our beliefs and values, we decided to sit out and not attend our first-round CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) game. We believe that allowing males in women's sports is unfair, creates safety concerns, and goes against our faith. We value fair competition and integrity in volleyball, and our hope is to continue playing the sport we love without having to be in a position where we know the situation is wrong.""

The two girls went on to cite their Christian faith as a reason for not playing, and insisted their actions were not aimed directly at the trans athlete.

""As Christians, our decision to sit out of this game was not hard to make, but it was uncomfortable being the only ones to do so. We chose not only to sit out from playing, but also not to attend the game, as a way to show our stance and our disagreement. Our goal was not to single out [the trans athlete], but to express our belief that biological males should not compete in women's sports,"" the statement continued. 

""Our decision was not made out of hate or discrimination toward anyone, but rather from our conviction in fairness and faith. It is our hope that the integrity of women's sports is honored and preserved.""

Valencia went on to win the playoff game, ending Jurupa Valley's season and seemingly ending the trans player's high school volleyball career.

Hazameh and McPherson were there in the stands that night. They were joined by a crowd of local ‘Save Girls' Sports' protesters, led by prominent activist and former NCAA women's soccer player Sophia Lorey. 

But the protest wasn't Hazameh and McPherson's first choice. They wanted to sit with their teammates on the team bench.

Hazameh and McPherson previously told Fox News Digital that their girls' volleyball coach instructed them to give her prior notice if they wanted to sit with their teammates on the bench for games. The girls claim they told their coach they wanted to sit with their teammates for the playoff game against Valencia, but were not given permission. 

An Oct. 27 email sent by Jurupa Valley High School's assistant principal to Hazameh's mom, Hanan Hazameh, addressed the mother's concerns about Hadeel not being able to sit on the bench with teammates. 

""After reviewing the matter, I confirmed that [the coach] did not instruct [redacted] or any other player that they were required to ask for permission to sit on the bench during volleyball games. Regarding your concern about the CIF game, I confirmed that [redacted] was not permitted to sit on the bench,"" the email read.

""Your email request regarding sitting on the bench was sent at 5:18 p.m. During that time, I was driving to Valencia High School and did not have access to my email. I did not see the message until later that evening, as I was assisting with supervision during the game to help ensure the event ran smoothly and safely. If you had called me earlier in the day we could have discussed your concerns before the game."" 

So the two teens spent the game hanging with ""Save Girls' Sports"" protesters, who welcomed them with open arms.

It was a tense night. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., re-shared a photo on X of two California residents who appeared to give malicious gestures to Hazameh and McPherson. 

""If you do this to little girls, your heart has turned entirely dark,"" Cruz wrote.

As Hazameh looks to a future without sports, she will look to continue her education, and is a member in the California movement to fight for Title IX. 

It didn't start that way. It wasn't her plan. She wanted to play volleyball and run track and field. But California's policies put her in the same locker room with a biological male for nearly four years forced her to this point.

And her story is just one of the many across California and the country involving girls who have been affected by such cases. 

As the Trump administration continues its crackdown on the issue, other girls like Hazameh, McPherson and others can only watch and hope for reconciliation.

Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' for the annual Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania Democrats and Republicans are finding rare common ground — defending Punxsutawney Phil from animal rights activists.

Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and GOP lawmakers are jointly rejecting pressure from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to retire the famed groundhog after he predicted six more weeks of winter on Monday.

Shapiro amplified the moment on social media by posting an image of a yellow Gadsden flag — a symbol associated with conservative politics and the 2010s Tea Party movement — but with the typical snake replaced by a groundhog.

Meanwhile, the leader of the Pennsylvania House Republican caucus told Fox News Digital that PETA's latest idea, to replace Phil with a groundhog hologram, is off base.

""PETA lacks as much good taste as they do credibility here. Punxsutawney Phil and the celebration of Groundhog Day are core parts of what it means to be Pennsylvanian and are cherished by the nation,"" said House Minority Leader Jesse Topper of Bedford.

""On top of that, Phil is treated like royalty, and rightfully so,"" Topper said, referencing his spacious library digs that also include a large window allowing sunlight and the smiles of passersby.

""It sounds like it is time PETA be forcibly retired from bad takes and outlandish viewpoints.""

In a statement, PETA said it wants to give Groundhog Day a ""much-needed glow-up.""

""Retire Phil to a reputable sanctuary with his family, and we'll provide a giant, state-of-the-art, 3-D projection hologram of a groundhog along with a vocal prognostication to light up the Gobbler's Knob stage,"" PETA said in a statement.

Pennsylvania Deputy Tourism Secretary Anne Ryan said in a statement that Punxsutawney Phil ""draws national and international attention"" to Pennsylvania every year.

""Six more weeks of winter means more time to enjoy everything that makes this season special — from skiing and snowboarding to cozy small towns, historic sites, and festive winter events,"" Ryan said, alluding to the commonwealth's latest tourism slogan, ""The Great American Getaway.""

Punxsutawney Phil lives with his wife Phyllis and their young kit at the Jefferson County Library in downtown Punxsutawney, halfway between Altoona and Erie.

The famed groundhog's support extends well beyond his burrow. Across Pennsylvania's historically German regions, including the Lehigh Valley and Dutch Country, Groundhog Day is marked by feasts hosted by more than a dozen ""Grundsau Lodsch,"" or Groundhog Lodges, featuring traditional food, music and weather forecasts delivered in the Pennsylfaanisch dialect.

There is also the famous 1993 Bill Murray film named after the holiday.

The Justice Department under President Donald Trump promised to quell unrest led by anti-immigration enforcement agitators in Minnesota and prosecute massive fraud. 

While the department has succeeded with a recent slate of protest-related arrests and obstruction charges related to violence against federal agents conducting immigration enforcement operations, the last federal action against fraud in the state was announced in mid-December 2025, prior to a viral video that elevated national attention on alleged schemes linked to the Somali community. And as independent journalists uncover large networks of encrypted group chats fueling the agitators that harass federal agents on the ground, FBI leadership has made no show of force other than stated commitments to investigate those networks.

Some law enforcement operations have been more streamlined than others. Incidents such as protest-related prosecutions can be pinpointed and charged with more speed and efficiency, while large-scale financial prosecutions often depend on experienced trial teams that the Minnesota federal prosecutor's office no longer has fully in place.

Last month, six senior federal prosecutors departed from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota over what the New York Times reported were internal disputes tied to the Trump administration's directives, though senior officials close to Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News that the prosecutors had submitted early retirement paperwork months earlier. 

Still, the threat of additional departures from career personnel looms large. During a recent meeting with U.S. Attorney Daniel Rosen, more prosecutors reportedly threatened to resign as he attempted to get his team aligned with the administration's agenda in the state, according to CNN.

Former federal prosecutor and University of St. Thomas law professor Mark Osler said the recent departures have left fraud cases especially vulnerable.

“When you lose people that are experienced and talented, that's going to be a problem,” Osler told the Washington Examiner. “And when you lose a lot of them at the same time, it's going to be a big problem.”

The administration's most recent effort to address the need to tackle fraud on a national level came last week when Trump announced the appointment of Colin McDonald as the first assistant attorney general for the newly created National Fraud Enforcement Division.

Colin is a rockstar, who was instrumental in our team's mission of Making America Safe Again. He is a consummate prosecutor who loves God, family, and country and will serve the President and the American people well. https://t.co/Plr4Mz9C3T

McDonald's role is designed to centralize and coordinate fraud prosecutions nationwide, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said McDonald was “instrumental” in the DOJ's broader crime-fighting efforts.

The announcement followed weeks of heightened attention on Minnesota after independent journalist Nick Shirley released viral reporting in December alleging widespread abuse in the state's child care and social services systems. Shirley went to dozens of businesses that exhibited suspicious qualities and raised questions about possibly fraudulent activity.

Since his reporting, however, no major Minnesota-based federal fraud indictments have been announced, even as administration officials and lawmakers have cited estimates suggesting more than $9 billion billed across 14 Medicaid services. To the administration's credit, there have been other recent fraud busts uncovered in recent days, including the arrest of a Los Angeles man who was accused on Jan. 23 of obtaining $23 million in public money intended to combat homelessness and pocketing $10 million.

On the state level, there has been at least one charging decision against Mohamed Abdirashid Omarxeyd, who is accused of defrauding the Minnesota Medical Assistance program out of more than $3 million. Omarxeyd also faces parallel federal charges stemming from a December indictment.

But the absence of new federal charging activity in Minnesota last month has left the public waiting, as Trump has labeled the state one of the worst in the nation for fraud schemes, tying that claim to the more than 98 individuals in the state who have been charged with fraudulent activities since 2022.

Osler pointed to the state's long-running $250 million Feeding Our Future fraud prosecution as a clear example of why staffing losses matter. The case, which began under the Biden administration, exposed massive abuse of pandemic-era meal programs and remains one of the most consequential fraud matters in the state.

“That was a serious, serious fraud that needs to be taken seriously — and they did, and they are,” Osler said. “But an ongoing part of it is seeking restitution, trying to get the money back. And that's something that skill and experience really helps with.”

He compared the loss of seasoned prosecutors to losing a teacher in the middle of a difficult course.

“You probably remember in high school when you had a difficult class like chemistry or physics,” Osler said. “You're going along through a difficult section, and your teacher gets sick, and then one day you get a substitute.”

Minnesota federal prosecutors last announced major fraud charges in mid-December, accusing six defendants, including Omarxeyd, of defrauding autism and housing stability programs. However, court records show the case has already suffered from delays, with Omarxeyd's initial appearance pushed back three times from an initial Jan. 12 appearance, to now a March 2 hearing.

That case was announced at the time by Joe Thompson, an 11-year career attorney in the office who recently served as the acting head of the Minnesota office prior to Rosen. Thompson was among the group of six who left the office last month.

The staffing dilemma has surfaced in other recent court cases involving major Minnesota fraud schemes.

On Jan. 20, Assistant U.S. Attorney Katharine Buzicky requested an extension in the case of Sharon Ross, a convicted Feeding Our Future defendant serving a 43-month sentence at a federal prison in Waseca, Minnesota. Buzicky cited new responsibilities stemming from “changes in office staffing,” and a judge granted the request, according to court filings.

Prosecutors are not the only roles needing to be filled in the U.S. attorney's office. Even its communications staff have exited the building, leaving the public in the dark.

When the Washington Examiner contacted the U.S. attorney's office on Jan. 20 seeking comment on the status of fraud investigations, an automated email stated it was “currently without a public information officer” and that responses may be delayed. A source familiar with the matter told the Washington Examiner there are efforts to hire a replacement but declined to offer any details about when the spot might be filled.

Osler said such abrupt departures for federal prosecutors are rarely ideological, though a recent report from CNN indicated the earlier wave of resignations was spurred in part by the DOJ's response to a federal officer's shooting of Renee Good on Jan. 7, in which senior officials pushed career staff to investigate the actions of her widow in and around the time of Good's death. The DOJ has pushed back on those claims.

“I don't know any of their individual reasons for leaving,” Osler said. “But when prosecutors leave abruptly, it's very often when they're being asked to do something that they don't think they can ethically do.”

Current public job listing underpins the hiring strains the office faces. As of this month, USAJobs.gov lists openings for both a criminal assistant U.S. attorney and a civil assistant U.S. attorney in the District of Minnesota.

Over the weekend, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller put out a public call to action over the need for assistant U.S. attorneys in offices across the country. “Reach out. Patriots needed,” he posted to X.

Miller's post was responding to another sent hours before by Bondi's former chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, who left the department in September. Bondi's former right-hand man more specifically called for applicants who “support President Trump and anti-crime agenda.”

If you are a lawyer, are interested in being an AUSA, and support President Trump and anti-crime agenda, DM me. We need good prosecutors. And DOJ is hiring across the country. Now is your chance to join the mission and do good for our country.

“We need good prosecutors,” Mizelle added. “And DOJ is hiring across the country. Now is your chance to join the mission and do good for our country.”

Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), who has been accused by Republicans of mishandling state resources that led to widespread schemes in his state, publicly acknowledged the staffing problem in the federal prosecutor's office during a recent appearance on Pod Save America, arguing it has disrupted fraud enforcement.

Tim Walz says the BILLIONS in fraud that robbed Minnesotans happens in every state.WALZ: ""This fraud thing happens in every state…"" pic.twitter.com/FpaE4BPa69

“This fraud thing happens in every state,” Walz said. “We had it here. I take responsibility for it. We were working hand in hand with the U.S. attorney's office — that's gone now. I don't even know who over there is working on fraud.”

Walz said state officials had been cooperating with federal prosecutors before the departures, underscoring how much of the current pace stems from personnel upheaval rather than a lack of investigative leads.

While the U.S. attorney's offices suffer from retention problems, the DOJ managed to move more efficiently on protest-related enforcement last week.

When Bondi was on the ground in Minnesota last week, she announced 16 defendants were charged in connection with violent assaults on federal officers and property during unrest in Minneapolis. Department of Homeland Security officials have also emphasized investigations into organized efforts to obstruct immigration enforcement.

One day later, the department was able to secure charges against additional defendants related to the Cities Church disruption on Jan. 18, including journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort, who participated in joining their protest in an act DOJ officials said amounted to a conspiracy against the rights of parishioners and FACE Act violations.

Meanwhile, FBI Director Kash Patel acknowledged this week that the bureau opened an investigation into Signal chat groups only after conservative journalist Cam Higby infiltrated and publicized them. The revelation of the chat, whose members included elected officials and an ally of the Democratic governor, has prompted calls by Trump supporters to prosecute members responsible for coordinating harassment campaigns against federal agents.

Border czar Tom Homan, who recently became the point person for the administration's immigration enforcement efforts, addressed the Signal investigation during remarks earlier this week.

“I'm not going to say a lot about that because I don't want to show our hand,” Homan said. “But justice is coming.”

Paul Perez, president of the National Border Patrol Council, echoed that assessment, adding the investigation must extend beyond street-level actors.

“We need to target these groups,” Perez told the National News Desk. “We need to go after the funding. We need to find out exactly where this is being orchestrated from — who's behind it.”

Blanche suggested Friday that the department's review of the chat was still on the radar. When pressed by a reporter whether the DOJ was “following the money” behind the organized protests, Blanche said, “I mean, yes.”

But questions among free speech advocacy group leaders remain as to whether the FBI initiative to investigate the chats will bear fruit in the context of quelling the harassment of federal agents, or whether possible prosecutions will even be successful.

Aaron Terr, director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, told Reason this week there might not be “any lawful basis for this investigation.”

“The First Amendment generally protects the publication of legally-obtained information, including much of what the Trump administration has labeled ‘doxxing,'” Terr said. “That protection extends to using an app to share information about ICE activity.”

The pressure over fraud allegations is set to intensify next month, when Walz and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison are scheduled to testify under oath before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

The appointment of McDonald as the DOJ's assistant attorney general for national fraud enforcement could improve coordination and handling of fraud cases across the state and the rest of the country, including by temporarily assigning prosecutors from Washington or other offices to help stabilize depleted teams such as Minnesota's.

“That kind of coordination can certainly help,” Osler said.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE SETS DATE FOR TIM WALZ TO TESTIFY

Still, he cautioned that even with a centralized fraud chief in place, it may not be enough to overcome the short term to alleviate the immediate problems of losing personnel who have spent years in the U.S. attorney's office.

“It's hard to do that when you've lost the talent that could offer that information from this office,” Osler said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","What Landman gets right about economics","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/faith-freedom-self-reliance/4442025/what-landman-gets-right-about-economics/","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

As Landman concluded a riveting second season, it offered a reminder of why it was the most popular show on television in 2025.

For those unfamiliar with Landman, created by Taylor Sheridan of Yellowstone fame, it stars Billy Bob Thornton as Tommy Norris, a crisis manager navigating the modern oil patch in Midland, Texas. If your tastes run to shows about wealth, power, ambition, and a dysfunctional family at the center, this show is for you. Think Dallas meets The Sopranos (with a twist of Nip-Tuck). 

The weaknesses are familiar. Some of the writing recalls the weaker stretches of Aaron Sorkin: long monologues that are clever but don't sound like real people talk. Critics have also taken aim at the show's depiction of women. They're not entirely wrong, as several female characters are exaggerated to the point of caricature, particularly Tommy's ex-wife and daughter. But this is not what Landman is really about.

HOCHUL INTRODUCES BILL TO CURB LOCAL AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGREEMENTS

One of the things that sets the show apart — and makes it worth discussing — is its grasp of economics.

The economist Thomas Sowell once observed that there are no solutions in life, only tradeoffs. Landman understands this idea and returns to it repeatedly.

The clearest example comes when Tommy explains to the company's new hotshot lawyer, Rebecca Falcone (Kayla Wallace), that M-Tex Oil powers off-grid wells using wind energy. She seems puzzled and a little angry by this, and asks Tommy why M-Tex would use “clean” energy to produce oil. 

“They use alternative energy,” Tommy says. “There's nothing clean about this.”

When Falcone scoffs, Tommy walks her through the inputs required to build and maintain wind turbines: diesel, steel, concrete, transport, lubrication, and winterization. He goes on to explain that even if the world wanted to go fully electric overnight, the transmission infrastructure doesn't exist. It would take decades to build. Meanwhile, society rests on a petroleum-based foundation that touches nearly every product imaginable — from roads and cars to plastics, medicines, and consumer goods.

DOJ SAYS NO EPSTEIN FILES WERE REDACTED FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS

Fact-checkers pounced on the scene, contending that wind turbines typically offset their carbon footprint within a few years, not decades. But focusing on that claim misses the larger point.

Tommy is not arguing that renewables are useless. He's pointing out that scaling any energy system comes with costs — material, financial, and environmental. Turbine blades are difficult to dispose of. Solar panels generate tons of toxic waste. Mining and processing raw materials consume vast amounts of resources. Capital spent on these projects cannot be spent elsewhere. These are opportunity costs, and they are real.

Every energy choice has consequences, Landman tells us — oil included.

“Getting oil out of the ground is the most dangerous job on earth,” Tommy says. “We don't do it because we like it. We do it because we run out of options.”

Tommy is not wrong about this. Fossil fuels like oil keep the world's lights on.  

Meanwhile, real-world examples show the “green” energies favored by Ms. Falcone are not the panacea many believe them to be. Countries such as Germany have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into alternative energies. Yes, this has resulted in fewer CO2 emissions. And yes, Germany is producing the bulk of its electricity from renewable sources.

REP. ERIC BURLISON: CONGRESS NEEDS TO GO BIG OR GO HOME

But Germany is also producing less electricity than it was in 1990 and has the fifth-highest household electricity prices in the world.

Landman is not just a show about wealth and power. It's a show about the costs of wealth and power, and the costs apply to rig workers and executives alike. 

Early in the series, three workers are killed on the job. The work is brutal and dangerous, but it pays. As one character puts it, it's one of the few ways an immigrant with no education can earn a six-figure income. The company must then decide how to compensate the families, raising hard ethical questions. But the show makes another point as well: the risks are not confined to the bottom of the hierarchy.

SMASH THE IRANIAN TERROR STATE

In the season finale of Season One, Tommy's boss, Monty Miller (John Hamm), dies. Monty is the CEO of M-Tex, wealthy and powerful, but crushed by the stress of running a multibillion-dollar company. His health fails, and viewers learn that despite his success, he leaves his widow (Demi Moore) in precarious financial shape.

Even dream jobs have opportunity costs. Landman isn't fantastic, but it's honest and fearless, poking fun at sacred cows in ways that will make some people laugh and others uncomfortable. While the show doesn't romanticize fossil fuels, it does help viewers understand why “quitting” them is not a realistic option and offers the most important lesson in economics: Everything has a cost.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Pete Hegseth Delights in Violence","https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/hegseth-trump-minnesota-ice-military/685848/","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

His first year at the Pentagon has been marked by uncomplicated celebrations of death.

Even before Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had declared Alex Pretti a domestic terrorist, Pete Hegseth was online trashing his home state. Hegseth, who grew up north of Minneapolis, took to social media in the hours after masked immigration agents shot the ICU nurse with a stark calculation: “ICE > MN.”

“We have your back 100%. You are SAVING the country,” the Pentagon chief told immigration agents in an X post. “Shame on the leadership of Minnesota—and the lunatics in the street.” Hegseth didn't define the we. He and fellow Cabinet members? The 1.3 million service members he commands? The troops he put on standby for potential deployment to Minneapolis? He hasn't said. But if there was any doubt about how Hegseth would wield military might if troops were sent to check unrest or dissent in U.S. cities, there's your answer.

Hegseth, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as a National Guardsman before becoming a Fox News weekend host, has repeatedly blamed “woke” and “weak” military leaders for imposing overly restrictive rules of engagement that, he believes, cost U.S. lives and prolonged America's “forever” wars. Since taking office, Hegseth has been an ardent supporter of Donald Trump's expanded use of troops in U.S. cities and his aggressive immigration operations. When federal immigration agents surged into Minneapolis, Hegseth put troops on prepare-to-deploy orders in North Carolina and Alaska. Trump has also threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow troops to conduct law-enforcement activities.

In standing with ICE's hard-line tactics against the citizens of Minnesota, Hegseth not only overstepped his jurisdiction as secretary of defense (he prefers to be called the “secretary of war”); he gave a glimpse of the belligerent approach he might take were those troops to be opposed by citizen protesters such as Pretti and Renee Good. It is one thing to defend your troops as they face enemies abroad. It is quite another to suggest that troops—or other armed government forces—have a free hand to do whatever they want on America's streets to American citizens.

Asked about Hegseth's comments, Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson said in an emailed statement that the secretary's mission was to execute Trump's orders and protect the United States: “We will do everything in our power to stop those who seek to harm Americans and the brave men and women defending our homeland.”

I've covered every secretary of defense since Bob Gates, who served George W. Bush and Barack Obama. No Pentagon chief then or since has embraced the jocular yet intimidating rhetoric that Hegseth has employed about the military's use of violence. At times, uniformed leaders have spouted off in public. Jim Mattis, the retired Marine general whom Trump referred to as “Mad Dog,” made tough-guy quips about how “it's fun to shoot some people” and the need to “have a plan to kill everyone you meet.” But Mattis turned out to be a check on—rather than an accelerant of—Trump's most disruptive instincts. Pentagon leaders have almost always publicly couched the military's use of violence in decorous euphemisms designed to show the solemnity of lethality. Insurgents are “eliminated” or “taken off the battlefield.” Public gloating, in an institution as storied and upright as the U.S. military, is viewed as unseemly.

Not so for Hegseth. His tone and vocabulary regarding the use of force are gleeful, juvenile, and crude. He has posted doctored children's-book covers that show a turtle named Franklin hanging out of a helicopter, shooting at drug boats. He embraced a phrase that the White House is now touting as Trump's doctrine for the use of force: fuck around and find out. And he has celebrated lethal strikes on suspected drug traffickers in small boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. After the initial strike in September, he told reporters, “I'd say we smoked a drug boat and there's 11 narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean—and when other people try to do that, they're gonna meet the same fate.” In November, hours after The Washington Post reported that commanders had killed two survivors of that strike, Hegseth posted, “We have only just begun to kill narco-terrorists.” Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing by the military and has not announced any internal investigations or reviews.

Trump's adviser Stephen Miller and the president himself employ similar cruelty when discussing what they see as America's urban pathologies (Trump has described an “invasion from within” and said U.S. cities should be used as “training grounds” for the military). But it's unusual, to say the least, for someone who sits in the top office at the Pentagon, a department focused on conflict outside the U.S. In theory, Hegseth is supposed to be setting an example for the world's most powerful military, responsible for a large nuclear arsenal and the life-and-death decisions of a massive global force.

Hegseth's regular demonization of domestic opponents (the “lunatics” he referred to are the same American citizens the military is duty bound to protect) also gives a glimpse into how he would view the power dynamic were troops to be deployed domestically. (In contrast to Hegseth's swagger, when Minnesota state leaders deployed the National Guard to assist local law enforcement this week, Guardsmen handed out coffee and doughnuts.)

Peter Feaver, an expert on civil-military relations at Duke University, told me that the top Pentagon officials responsible for the nation's sons and daughters in service, and the weighty matters of war and peace, generally have tried to stay out of public political squabbles as much as possible. Hegseth, instead, “has adopted a messaging posture that breaks with that tradition, perhaps reflecting his own background as a partisan commentator on Fox News and thus his comfort with the hot takes and rapid-response mentality of that medium,” Feaver said. “Having the secretary be so prominent in partisan sparring can put pressure on the nonpartisan military, whose professional ethic requires them to stay out of the fray.”

Staying out of the fray is exactly what U.S. troops—the National Guard and a small contingent of active-duty Marines—have done over the past year as the president and his allies deployed them to assist federal agents, fight crime, or respond to unrest in cities including Los Angeles, Memphis, and the nation's capital. Military experts say that's because military personnel have more extensive training and better discipline than ICE or Border Patrol agents.

But Hegseth's firing of the top Army, Navy, and Air Force lawyers suggests a different potential problem in any further domestic deployments, Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me. Hegseth, who, before taking office, advocated for the lenient treatment of troops convicted of war crimes, might simply override the military-justice system if any violence occurs. “There's always somebody who acts inappropriately, even criminally, in a moment of stress or frustration and needs to be held accountable,” Cancian said. “That will be a test.”

Hegseth's attitude is rooted in his disillusionment and disappointment over his experience in Iraq, people who know him say. In his 2024 book, The War on Warriors, Hegseth boasted about instructing members of the platoon he led to disregard their rules of engagement, a shocking admission and one that now looks especially ominous should the Trump administration deploy troops in new ways within the United States.

Hegseth described his time in the 101st Airborne's 3rd Brigade Combat Team—the camaraderie, stress, and euphoria of combat—as transformational. He emulated then-Colonel Michael Steele, a Black Hawk Down veteran and brigade commander who he felt was wrongly held responsible for attacks on civilians that occurred under his watch, one of the people who know Hegseth told me.

Those rules of engagement are handed down from commanders who are advised by military lawyers, called judge advocates general. Their aim is to ensure that operations comply with U.S and international law.

Hegseth has dismissed JAGs as “jagoffs” and complained that their decisions led to U.S. troops “fighting with one hand behind our back” in Iraq and Afghanistan. “When you send Americans to war, their mandate should be to lethally dominate the battlefield,” he wrote. “Our enemies should get bullets, not attorneys.”

Hegseth's approach at the Pentagon has reflected those convictions. Since taking over a year ago, Hegseth has fired top generals and flag officers and vowed to empower the trigger-pullers. Speaking to senior uniformed leaders he summoned to a Marine base in Virginia last fall, Hegseth said the military would fight wars to win, not to defend, and  would end “stupid” restrictions on the use of force. “We untie the hands of our warfighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt, and kill the enemies of our country,” he told hundreds of officers. “No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement; just common sense, maximum lethality, and authority for warfighters.”

Read: Pete Hegseth is the Pentagon's holy warrior

Hegseth has company among some other veterans of the post-9/11 wars in believing that restrictive rules of engagement led to the U.S. failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, because troops were prevented from killing more insurgents, Jason Dempsey, a former Army officer who served two years in Afghanistan, told me. Dempsey described Hegseth's attitude this way: “There should be no standards on the battlefield because it's all us versus them, black versus white, good versus evil, and there are no innocent or undecided people in between.”

The importance of projecting strength and toughness is a deeply held belief for Hegseth, one of the people who know him told me. At the same time, Hegseth takes his cues from Trump, whose support is key to him keeping his role. In recent days, the president has distanced himself from his subordinates' hot-blooded response to Pretti's death, and his “border czar” has promised to wind down the federal immigration surge in Minnesota. In this case, Hegseth may be out of step with what his boss now wants.

The president has turned his biggest political asset into a liability.

When President Donald Trump launched his deportation campaign last January, he had the American public at his back.

Under Joe Biden, unauthorized border crossings had soared to record levels — and threw America into a nativist mood. In November 2024, a CBS News/YouGov poll found 57 percent of Americans expressing support for “a national program to find and deport all immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally,” while 73 percent said that the next president should make deportations a priority.

The Trump White House was happy to oblige. And during its first months in office, the public seemed pleased with its efforts. In early 2025, voters approved of Trump's handling of immigration by as much as 12 points, while favoring his “program to deport immigrants illegally in the US” by 16.

Immigration was the foundation of Trump's political strength — the issue where he consistently enjoyed the trust of a supermajority of Americans.

And he squandered it within a year.

Once, the phrase “Trump's immigration policy” evoked images of order in the American imagination: a wall ringing the nation's borders, migrant panhandlers and criminals airbrushed from city streets.

Today, those words conjure much different pictures — of masked paramilitaries pepper-spraying protesters, breaking into people's homes, tearing parents from their crying children, and pumping bullets into American citizens.

Voters do not like what they see. Trump's approval on immigration is now underwater by 12 points. Americans disapprove of his “deportation program” by 8 points and say ICE is making communities “less safe” rather than “more safe” by 21. Not long ago, “Abolish ICE” was among the most politically toxic propositions in American politics. Now, 46 percent of voters — including one-fifth of Republicans — support the idea, according to a recent YouGov poll.

Until this week, the White House evinced little concern for its immigration agenda's collapsing support. When an ICE agent needlessly shot a 37-year-old mother to death in Minneapolis in early January, the Trump administration immediately rallied to the shooter's defense. When Border Patrol agents were caught on video Saturday firing 10 bullets into the back of a protester, the Department of Homeland Security swiftly smeared the victim as a domestic terrorist, effectively asking Americans to trust its word over their lying eyes.

Even conservatives struggled to stomach that last act of depravity. The administration's handling of Alex Pretti's killing provoked rebukes from Republican senators, right-wing magazines, and the NRA.

Faced with a backlash so broad and overwhelming, Trump finally decided to change course, however minutely.

In recent days, he demoted his hardline Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, extended an olive branch to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, discussed Democratic demands for DHS reform with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and suggested that Pretti's death would receive a thorough investigation (although, there are signs this may not actually be the case).

Given the scale of ICE and CPB's lawlessness, it would be generous to call these half-measures. The administration still appears staunchly opposed to reforms that would actually ensure its deportation forces' professionalism and legal accountability. It is still eager to use immigration policy as a tool for terrorizing ethnic minorities and punishing the administration's political adversaries.

By indulging these radical impulses, Trump has achieved an extraordinary feat of political self-sabotage: He has managed to turn his greatest source of political vitality into a vulnerability — and done so despite successfully addressing the electorate's chief complaint on that issue as of 2024.

The Biden-era surge in migration fueled widespread discontent.

Vast and sudden influxes of asylum-seekers — who were often both indigent and legally barred from employment — burdened many municipalities' social services, increased visible homelessness, and sparked an array of fears and resentments in longtime US residents (not least, among those who had themselves immigrated in the recent past).

By the time Trump took office, however, the migrant wave had already crested.

This was partly due to America's softening labor market. Border crossings had first started soaring in late 2020, as US employers expanded hiring and hiked wages to satisfy rebounding consumer demand. Faced with more tepid recoveries in their home countries, many migrants went north in search of opportunity.

By 2024, however, job growth in the US was slowing — and the American economy's magnetic force was weakening. Illegal border crossings fell by 53 percent between December 2023 and May 2024.

The following month, Biden enacted various new restrictions on asylum, which helped reduce unauthorized migration by another 44 percent between June and November of 2024.

Biden and Kamala Harris derived little political benefit from this decline, likely because they were associated with the spike that had preceded it.

But Trump did not have that problem. His reputation for “toughness” on immigration was unquestioned.

And it served the new president in more ways than one: Upon his inauguration, unauthorized immigration immediately plunged to its lowest point on record. In February 2025, only 8,326 migrants crossed the US southern border, down from 47,300 in December 2024 — and 249,740 in December 2023.

In other words: Before Trump had changed virtually anything about immigration policy, the border crisis was effectively solved.

Given these conditions, little stood between Trump and political success on immigration. He could have done nothing and still credibly claimed to have secured the border. Had Trump pursued a normal, restrictionist agenda — higher spending on border enforcement, more deportations of (even low-level) criminal offenders, restrictions on opportunities for asylum — he likely would have appeased his base and swing voters alike.

But he didn't.

Granted, there is more to governance than maximizing your approval rating. The point of politics is not merely to gain power but to use it. Trump and his allies were not content to deter future immigration or deport undocumented criminals. They wanted to purge America of all undocumented immigrants — or at least, all those who did not work for their cronies in the hospitality and agricultural sectors. 

Yet even this may undersell their ambitions. Some in the White House plainly wish to exile legal immigrants from certain countries, on the grounds that their ethnic groups corrode our nation's culture and poison its blood.

Apparently, the only thing more unpopular than a nakedly authoritarian immigration policy is a Democratic one.

Nevertheless, even from the standpoint of advancing its incendiary ideological goals, the administration's approach to immigration enforcement appears self-undermining. After all, the White House hasn't just pursued radical objectives, but made a big show of its own extremity and authoritarianism.

Perhaps, the administration's immigration enforcement operations were motivated by racial animus rather than a desire to uphold the law. But it still would not have been wise to say as much: Trump would not have won the 2024 election without substantial support from both nonwhite and immigrant voters.

And yet Trump's Department of Homeland Security has chosen to post on social media white nationalist slogans from its official social media accounts, while the president has derided all Somali-Americans as “low-IQ people.”

Meanwhile, it seems obvious that, if you want to limit backlash to intensive deportation operations, you must ensure that they burden US citizens as little as possible.

And yet, even as stories of ICE and CBP's maltreatment of Americans piled up last year, the administration sought to reduce their legal accountability while loosening training standards.

This posture reached its apotheosis with the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti.

In each of those cases, the administration had every incentive to proceed cautiously. Video evidence of both shootings indicated that — at the very least — they may have been illegitimate.

And if its deportation forces had in fact lawlessly executed an American citizen, the White House would be ill-advised to take ownership of such violence.

The administration could have responded to each killing with expressions of sorrow and calls for investigation. It might have even declared the killers a few bad apples, whose recklessness undermined ICE's fundamental mission: to keep Americans safe.

Instead, it chose to immediately defend the killer and defame the victim — by telling lies blatantly contradicted by video evidence.

The White House's commitment to this messaging strategy was as strategically puzzling as it was morally odious. In the weeks following Good's killing, polling revealed that a supermajority of Americans had not bought the White House's line. Disapproval of ICE shot up past 60 percent.

Nevertheless, when Border Patrol fired 10 bullets into Pretti's prone body, the administration sang an even shriller rendition of the same tune.

Given all this, it is remarkable — and disconcerting — that Trump's standing on immigration is not even worse.

Immigration remains the president's best issue. According to the progressive data journalist G. Elliott Morris's poll tracker, Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration by 9 points — while disapproving of his handling of inflation by 26. Trump's marks on all other major issues fall between those two poles.

More troublingly, the GOP seems to have retained an advantage on immigration. In a Wall Street Journal poll taken after Good's killing, voters said that the Republican Party was “better equipped” to handle immigration than the Democrats by an 11-point margin.

Apparently, the only thing more unpopular than a nakedly authoritarian immigration policy is a Democratic one.

Nevertheless, Trump's unabashed extremism has made the Democratic Party's vulnerabilities on border security less salient. As the public has soured on the president's immigration agenda, the Democrats' lead in 2026 midterm polling has grown from a measly 0.2 points last April to 5.5 points today.

Trump could have embraced a center-right immigration agenda and coasted to political success on the issue. Or he could have pursued Stephen Miller's radical plans for America's ethnic purification with a modicum of stealth and message discipline. Instead, his administration has behaved as though only Truth Social users have voting rights.

Minnesota provides a blueprint for how to prevent a slide into authoritarianism we've seen in other countries.

President Donald Trump is frequently accused of authoritarian ambitions. It's an image he often seems to relish, either sincerely or as trolling. “Usually they say, ‘He's a horrible dictator-type person,' I'm a dictator,” he said in Davos. “But sometimes you need a dictator!” Over the past decade, he's made a political career by dominating the news with spectacles of outlandish behavior and transgressions against the norms of American democracy. For Trump, there's no such thing as bad press so long as he can cast himself as the all-powerful main character in every story.

Trump's immigration operation in Minneapolis, with his loud declarations of “RETRIBUTION” as thousands of heavily armed officers flooded into a frightened and angry city, fit that brand. It has led to a new wave of concern among Americans that their basic freedoms are in acute danger. The killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers made Minneapolis look like a testing ground for a new deadly phase of repressive violence by heavily armed and highly funded agencies accountable only to Trump, one that could be replicated elsewhere as needed.

But life in authoritarian regimes today rarely looks like the garish displays of force we saw in Minnesota. More often, it's marked by a kind of stultifying normalcy: People go to work, raise families, start businesses, and even join opposition parties — they just have no hope of defeating the ruling regime in elections. Open violence is more often reserved for rare situations that pose an immediate and active threat to the government's grip on power.

Durable authoritarian regimes in the modern era do not embrace the spectacle of politics that characterized regimes such as Nazi Germany. Fascist regimes like the Nazis embrace the visual imagery of authoritarian power, and films such as Leni Riefenstahl's chilling propaganda piece The Triumph of the Will showcase the public spectacle of totalitarianism. But such regimes are rare in the contemporary era.

In this, the administration's decision to target Minnesota for a highly publicized anti-immigrant campaign reveals a key contradiction between Trump's own brand of politics and his administration's long-term anti-democratic agenda. By taking his cartoonish strongman approach to violent new levels, he may have frustrated a far more dangerous and insidious effort by his allies to quietly lay the groundwork for the more subtle and enduring kinds of authoritarian regimes we see around the world.

The most disturbing possibility of Trump's second term is that figures like Stephen Miller, Vice President JD Vance, and others are looking beyond the current administration, toward a future in which the nation's democratic institutions and independent centers of power, from the judiciary to activists to independent media to a professionalized bureaucracy, can be hollowed out or bullied into submission.

Trump's closest allies and advisers can look to countries like Hungary under Viktor Orbán, where the ruling party has gradually consolidated power across civil society, as inspiration in this regard. And so far, the White House has made some early progress in emulating Orbán's approach. The administration has decorated Washington with Trump's face, promised to deliver grand new buildings, held military parades, and begun to rebrand the performing arts in honor of Trump. Business leaders have publicly embraced Trump this term, knowing he won't hesitate to involve himself in their affairs, including by demanding favorable treatment from, or friendly ownership of, major media properties.

Independent economic institutions like the Federal Reserve face growing interference, including very public demands from Trump himself. The Justice Department now regularly opens up investigations into political opponents, including leaders in Minnesota during the current immigration standoff. And then there's the concern that Trump will make headway in his long-running quest to interfere with or overturn elections themselves (in a chilling possible sign of the administration's ambitions, the Department of Justice demanded that Minnesota turn over its voter roll as part of the latest immigration fight).

Dismantling democracy to build an electoral authoritarian regime is difficult, slow-going work. It is best done in secret, away from the spotlight, so that citizens do not know what is happening, or through administrative and legal maneuvers that are so uninteresting and gradual that citizens find it difficult to care. The idea is to show that there is nothing particularly menacing or terrifying about an undemocratic political order.

Authoritarian regimes can last for decades in this unremarkable state in which regime elites oversee peaceful but uncompetitive elections and voters participate without any expectation of political change. This kind of authoritarianism works because it is boring and tolerable: The government provides stability, predictability, and everyday comforts for most citizens, and in exchange, those citizens tolerate what they cannot easily change.

Trump's compulsive need to create a spectacle means that his administration cannot hide its anti-democratic intentions. Rather, administration officials must continually engage with the public, communicating openly and aggressively about their actions and continually picking fights with their opponents. They must post edgy memes on social media, and they must tell obvious lies on the news. In Minnesota, the ICE agent who killed Renee Good was recording the encounter with a cellphone at the time, which some speculated tied into a White House push to aggressively turn out viral social media videos of arrests and confrontations. In doing so, they invite the exact kind of public scrutiny that can frustrate their anti-democratic agenda.

Electoral authoritarian regimes can still collapse due to intra-elite squabbles, external crises, or economic shocks — but they tend not to generate mass opposition or destabilizing protests. The key to maintaining a boring and tolerable political order is to ensure that there is nothing newsworthy to mobilize people into action. The population should not be angry; it should be indifferent.

When destabilizing mass protests do emerge in such regimes, as happened during the Arab Spring revolutions, they usually take everyone by surprise. In fact, the trigger for the Arab Spring — the self-immolation of Tunisian fruit vendor Mohamed Bouazizi — is exactly the type of tragic, gripping public spectacle that can mobilize populations to overthrow entrenched authoritarian regimes. In 10 years, Americans may look back on the public execution of two peaceful American citizens as a similar kind of tragedy that focused popular anger on the administration and its excesses.

This perspective helps to make sense of why the administration's decision to target Minnesota has proven so damaging for its long-term objectives. Precisely because Minnesotans have ensured that the spectacle of violence by federal forces is so public, abetted by administration officials' own shameful public statements which seem to revel in their mendacity, Americans can see what is happening — and they evidently don't like it. Public backlash has already led to meaningful congressional scrutiny of the Department of Homeland Security and its conduct, including public demands from Republicans for a transparent investigation.

Trump himself has always appeared more concerned with attention and power than building a political legacy that outlasts him. Minnesota may represent a temporary retreat, but his deep need to generate more and more explosive confrontations is not going anywhere, even if some of his allies would prefer he give them more room to play the long game in silence. The lesson for Americans who wish to support democracy is simple: Lean into Trump's need to constantly seek self-aggrandizing confirmation of his own power, make the spectacle public and unavoidable, and show voters that the administration's actions are intolerable. Americans may yearn for boring and tolerable politics, but they will not get it under these conditions.

Why another big swing at health care reform is coming.

Another window to stem America's latest health care cost crisis has closed. Congress set a self-imposed deadline of January 30 to reach a compromise to extend financial assistance available under the Affordable Care Act, and that deadline has passed without an agreement. Already, about 4 million Americans have lost their government aid, and many of them have chosen to go uninsured because they can no longer afford their health insurance premiums without it.

This is the American health care story: political paralysis in the face of unaffordable costs. For the millions of people directly impacted, it is a terrible blow.

I've been working on the beat for 15 years, and health insurance keeps getting more expensive. It is one of the most consistent sources of frustration and pain for voters. It is an embarrassment compared to other wealthy countries that manage to deliver universal health care at a lower cost.

This failure to act, yet again, makes the moment feel more hopeless than ever.

A newsletter for anyone trying to make sense of their health.

But it may not be.

Despite lawmakers' ongoing impasse, the conditions are actually ripening for another serious attempt to improve the American health care system. Here's the case for a little optimism on the eve of yet another health care policy failure.

What's particularly galling about this week's (non)event is that nearly two-thirds of Americans believe it is the federal government's responsibility to make sure people have health coverage.



Now, take a closer look at that chart.

The last time Americans were this unified around the idea of the government guaranteeing health coverage was around 2008 — shortly before our last major health reform law, the Affordable Care Act, passed. The politics of health care are cyclical. It goes something like this:

A problem becomes impossible for politicians to ignore, and lawmakers pass (or try to pass) an imperfect plan to address it — and then…

Voters become incensed over that specific plan — and then…

The backlash leaves lawmakers too afraid to try to pass any more significant reforms until the public becomes so fed up again that our leaders feel compelled to act.

Paul Starr, the preeminent historian of American health care, coined a term for this cycle: remedy and reaction.

For the past 16 years, we have been in a period of reaction to the ACA: Democrats sought to reduce the persistently high uninsured rates among the working class and people in poverty, they came up with the ACA to achieve that goal, voters initially rejected the law after campaigning from Republicans and some corner of the business industry, and the lingering bruises from that backlash made many Democrats reluctant to propose major changes in 2016, 2020 and 2024.

But now the wheel may finally be coming back around.

You need a few things to make a big health care push: that critical mass of political support, serious policy chops, and buy-in from at least some of the major health care business interests. The ACA, for example, resulted from Barack Obama's massive electoral mandate, decades of policy planning dating back to at least the early Clinton years, and acquiescence from hospitals and Big Pharma that opted not to mount a major resistance.

All three factors are starting to align again.

We've covered the public's attitude on health care already. The ACA subsidy cliff and Republicans' Medicaid cuts could deepen their anger and their desire for change. The shift to direct-to-consumer health care sales — like people paying cash for Ozempic at Costco — will further heighten the inequities in our system while squeezing many people's wallets.

On policymaking, below the surface, the gears have been slowly churning, setting the stage once again for future action.

This is a key part of the cycle: Momentum builds slowly, imperceptibly except to those paying close attention, before short windows open that allow for bursts of policymaking.

Democrats went through a robust debate around what their next health care overhaul might look like during the 2020 presidential primary: Medicare-for-all, Medicare for all who want it, more targeted reforms to private insurance. They have been vetting and finetuning these concepts for a decade at this point. More recently, state-level public insurance options have gotten off the ground in states like Washington and started to show promising results; those experiences could be valuable when lawmakers are crafting a national plan, just as an existing Massachusetts health care reform law informed the ACA's development.

Right now, there is a new bipartisan group of lawmakers trying to deliver a deal on reforms for pharmacy benefits managers and more. In another sign of the shifting winds, the Trump administration has made moves to reduce drug prices, taking steps — such as trying to align US prices with international prices — that would have been unthinkable for a Republican a decade ago.

On our third point, some major special interest groups are having their own moments of crisis — and they're in the mood to consider serious reforms. The American Medical Association, long an opponent of single-payer health care, has been gradually softening its stance; it has also advocated for restoring the ACA financial assistance and building upon the law. Even if a true, single-payer system remains a tough sell in the US, these are notable signals that the nation's most powerful physician lobbying group may not oppose a more muscular government role in providing health insurance and trying to limit costs.

And as I have reported, some companies are starting to seriously ponder the future of employer-sponsored insurance as the cost of providing it continues to grow. Those employer-sponsored plans, which insure about half the US, have long been considered untouchable because they offer tax-free health benefits — a major value for the private sector. And some companies say they still see that value. But if more firms decide they want to stop playing the role of health insurance administrator, that would be a massive political shift that could open up all kinds of new possibilities.

So what comes next?

National politics will be important: Democrats seem more likely than Republicans to mount a major health care reform effort. But even there, you can argue that the stars are aligning more than it might seem: President Donald Trump is so unpopular right now that the Democrats winning the Senate is plausible. Then they only need to take the presidency in 2028, and the window will, at least in theory, be open. Health care is a top priority for voters. That won't change.

Update February 2, 2026, 9 am ET: This story was originally published on February 2 and has been updated now that Congress's self-imposed deadline for passing an ACA subsidy deal has passed.

While the Trump administration continues its immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, anti-ICE protests continued in Minneapolis and around the country — from Los Angeles to rural Maine — over the weekend.

In the Twin Cities area, meanwhile, this activism is well-organized; but it's not a traditional, anti-government protest movement of the likes we saw during President Donald Trump's first term. Some have called this new model “dissidence” or “neighborism” — or, more traditionally, “direct action.” As one organizer described what's happening in the city, “it's kind of unorganized-organized.”

To better understand this new development and its possible ramifications, Vox spoke with Harvard University's Theda Skocpol, a renowned expert on political organizing in the US, who has written seminal analyses of the decline of the labor movement, the rise of the Tea Party movement, and the strengths and weaknesses of the resistance movement that arose during Trump's first term.

When Vox last spoke to Skocpol, in the days after October's No Kings protests, Skocpol emphasized that the point of protest isn't to keep growing the number of people in the streets. It's to create opportunities for organizing and to build lasting political power.

In her view, Minnesota is meeting that model for opposition: “Minnesota has emerged as a heroic example of state and local and neighborhood-level resistance in the name of core patriotic and Christian values. And that is an extraordinarily powerful counterforce that will transform what other states and localities do.”

Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

What were your initial reactions to how Minneapolis responded to the ICE surge this year, and to the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti?

The Trump administration made a huge mistake in thinking that Minneapolis would be an easy display case for overwhelming an urban area. They must have thought this would be an easy place to demonstrate overwhelming force that would cow people into saying, “Whatever you want to do is fine,” and then they could proceed to other places.

What they misjudged is that Minnesota, including the Twin Cities area, has a very strong civic culture and a lot of neighborhood connectivity. And this has been very much neighbors organizing to help neighbors and to monitor what's going on. It certainly was enabled by the fact that Mayor Jacob Frey took a strong stand right from the beginning in calling “bullshit, bullshit.”

[Minnesota] was the wrong place to try and do that, because in many ways they were pre-networked and ready to push back. The cumulative effect of the two [killings] and the fact that the lying was so blatant and the effort to demonize the victims was over the top — it's that sequence that, on top of a highly mobilized urban area, that just made this explosive.

How do these protests differ from earlier anti-Trump and anti-ICE protests we've seen, like No Kings, or the anti-ICE actions in Los Angeles and Chicago?

All these things are complementary. I would point to three kinds of movements. First is big street demonstrations, protests. There are elements of that in Minneapolis, of course.

Then there are organized groups that are engaged in ongoing political pushback. The Tea Party and the anti-Trump resistance in 2016 were both examples of that. They were sparked by the election of a president and co-partisans in Washington that caused people to organize and start continuous pushback, not just street demonstrations.

The thing in Minneapolis is something further that we haven't seen elements of elsewhere. It's churches and neighborhoods and grassroots community organizational networks that are already existing, that mobilized to help immigrant families first and foremost. Then this developed into these kind of watchers with cameras. There've been elements of that in other places, but it's just much more pervasive, widespread, and organized in Minneapolis.

Underneath it all is people in their churches, in their neighborhoods, organizing like a PTA meeting. In a lot of parts of America, you couldn't organize a PTA meeting.

You've offered observations before about what anti-Trump resistance efforts should look like: You've said that they should be bottom-up, grassroots-organized, and energized around specific goals in both election years and off-years to be lasting. 

Is Minneapolis following that model?

This is a further iteration of it because the threat is continuous. The ICE surges are not just an election year thing. It will carry over.

Also, I'm not saying there are no top-down elements here, but it rests on a very strong civic and neighborhood culture. There are a lot of organizers in Minneapolis; some are Indivisible-connected, some are labor unions. There's strong labor unions there. That matters.

There are people who are doing what they can to raise money, to organize trainings, to do all kinds of things that really empower and create channels for people to step into it if they want to and haven't before.

The political leadership in the state of Minnesota has also been important. Governor [Tim] Walz has gotten more confrontational. It was very important that Mayor Frey didn't hesitate when he spoke up right away.

But there is a highly financed, huge, and rapidly growing paramilitary force in the land. And it's not going away quickly.

But I don't expect people in Minneapolis to quit. I don't think they're going to be easily fooled about things. I expect their ongoing resistance to remain in proportion to whatever threat they face.

So can this resistance be replicated beyond Minneapolis? Or do these qualities mean resisting this effectively is unique to Minnesota?

We have to be a little cautious, because I don't think there are very many metropolitan areas where the combination of political leadership and community-level networks are as strong and ready to respond.

There are some distinctions, yes. Scandinavian public culture is very embedded there. And it doesn't matter if you're Scandinavian or not. The layout of the city, the way people were just realizing things are happening through kids and parents of kids in school [made a difference]. A lot of the people who are active are not going out to protest, are not even standing out with cameras. They're ferrying groceries to neighbors, picking up kids at school. So you have neighborhood networks, some of which are left over from the fact that police reform had gone very far there [after the 2020 George Floyd protests].

It's important that there's a lot of religious-based organizing, primarily Lutherans. Lutherans are moderate Protestants, not part of this kind of Christian nationalist wing. There's lots of Methodists and Catholics involved here too, and Jews and Muslims. But Lutherans have a strong congregational culture.

So it's not going to be easy to find this unique combination. But it also may be that the Trump administration will not have the wherewithal to send such a massive force into one place.

If you come into Massachusetts, you're going to face some similar stuff, and they would've faced similar stuff in Maine if they'd gone further there.

So what comes next? Will this get us over the popular 3.5 percent theory for social change [that governments aren't able to survive when 3.5 percent of the citizenry engages in sustained nonviolent protest]? Will other cities and states be able to replicate this?

What the people of Minneapolis have managed is to raise national awareness of this authoritarianism. It's an astonishing proportion of Americans who watched the videos of the Pretti and Good killings. We're in the 70 percent range.

In March, we're going to see the next round of No Kings protests. If the weather is good, we might see bigger numbers, and exceed the popular 3.5 percent protest metric. But it's always going to be a small minority of people who actually go out to street demonstrations, and they're always going to be skewed younger.

The significance of these events in Minneapolis is that they have basically shown us a kind of moral resistance. We're beyond the point now where people can't see what this is. In that way, the deaths of these two people are now being described in martyr-like terms.

Other places will learn from Minneapolis. If there are efforts to flood cities with paramilitary forces, others will organize. It won't be easy, but the fact that Minneapolis did it first — it's a model. People do move between these places. From Chicago to California, and to Charlotte, North Carolina, there's learning that goes on.

So I'm not pessimistic about the Minneapolis resistance. It's really neighborhood self-help and resistance. It's not occasional protests; it's ongoing. It's every day that people have worked this into their routines, and I don't believe it will stop until the horrors stop.

One of the things this has done is to wake up state-level officials that they've got to get their act together. It's been slow, but if you have federal militarized forces descending on your state, and at the same time the federal government's trying to cut off revenue, you better organize; you better be prepared to explain what you're doing to your citizens.

Minnesota has emerged as a heroic example of state- and local- and neighborhood-level resistance in the name of core patriotic and Christian values. And that is an extraordinarily powerful counterforce that will transform what other states and localities do — and what many associations that we don't think of as political will do.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Gold and silver are fighting to stabilize after a historic market meltdown","https://www.businessinsider.com/gold-price-silver-price-today-market-crash-outlook-forecast-warsh-2026-2","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:24:00 GMT","

Precious metals were paring some of their steep losses on Monday, rising after briefly extending a historic sell-off that shook the market on Friday.

Gold was down by less than 1% at around $4,700 per ounce, after tumbling more than 10% on Friday in its worst decline since 2013. Despite the recent pullback, the metal remains up about 10% year to date.

Silver remained highly volatile, falling about 2% to around $77 an ounce after plunging as much as 36% on Friday, the biggest single-day loss since 1980.

The crash in metal markets came after Donald Trump tapped Kevin Warsh to run the Federal Reserve. Warsh is viewed as more hawkish and more likely to preserve the central bank's independence than other candidates.

That outlook hit the debasement trade — pushing the US dollar higher, weighing on dollar-denominated commodities such as gold and silver. As markets open in the US on Monday, though, conditions appear to have stabilized as both precious metals demonstrate an ability to rise above macro-driven volatility.

Most importantly, Warsh supports shrinking the Fed's balance sheet, which would ease fears of a weaker dollar and help explain recent declines in gold and silver prices, wrote Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's Asia head of research excluding Japan, on Monday in Asia.

Before the sell-off, gold had been on a blistering yearlong rally, fueled by heavy central bank buying and geopolitical tensions.

Those forces remain in place and now appear to be provide support, despite previous speculation.

""I think the fundamentals remain pretty well in place despite those risks around Fed independence,"" Daniel Hynes, a senior commodities analyst at ANZ , told Bloomberg TV, on Monday.

Hynes said broad geopolitical tensions continue to support the gold market, even as he expects price volatility to remain high.

""The general unbending of the world order that we hear about constantly, and the US's role within that, has really been at the crux of this haven buying, and I don't see that ending any time soon,"" he said.

However, analysts are continuing to warn on silver, whose gains have far outpaced gold in recent months due to speculative Chinese demand.

Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote on Friday that gold is susceptible to a pullback amid this month's surge in prices. However, price declines in gold are likely to be met with fresh demand.

But silver may struggle to keep pace with gold. Several finance pros have speculated that it will likely fall in the coming months.

""Its heavy reliance — in normal times — on industrial demand could become a drag as some end users, particularly within the solar sector, increasingly seek alternative materials in order to protect margins,"" Hansen wrote.

""In addition, a rise in scrap supply is expected in the coming months as owners cash in long-held bars, cutlery and jewellery following a seven-fold increase in prices over the past decade,"" he added.

Silver prices crashed in a harrowing roller-coaster ride that underscored how quickly China's army of speculators can move global commodity markets — and how fast those gains can unravel.

The white metal has been in the spotlight over the past year after dramatically outperforming gold. Prices surged about 170% in 2025 and climbed more than 60% again in early 2026, vaulting silver to $121 per troy ounce at its peak before the rally spectacularly broke down.

Spot silver was trading around $77.10 per troy ounce at 3:06 a.m. ET on Monday, having erased a large portion of its historic gains in just a few sessions.

On Friday, silver prices cratered as much as 36% as investors rushed to lock in profits following the meteoric rally and adjust positions.

The sell-off came on the back of President Donald Trump announcing Kevin Warsh as his pick for the next Federal Reserve chair. The move rattled markets and sparked a sharp reassessment of interest-rate expectations.

Even before the meltdown, warning signs were flashing in China, where speculative trading had reached frenetic levels, leaving prices vulnerable to a rapid unwind.

""Before the correction, warning signs emerged on Tuesday as Chinese investors faced difficulties withdrawing funds from leveraged gold-trading accounts, and several Chinese funds halted subscriptions to manage overheating sentiment,"" wrote Fabien Yip, a market analyst at IG, on Monday.

In response to the volatility, major trading venues, including CME Group and the Shanghai Gold Exchange, raised margin requirements. Higher margins require traders to post more cash to hold positions. The move is aimed at cooling speculation but it often forces leveraged investors to sell — adding further downward pressure to prices.

""Price action was magnified by margin calls on leveraged positions, which further intensified selling pressure amongst other traders,"" Yip said.

Silver's violent price reversal followed recent analyst warnings that silver's rally was running far ahead of underlying fundamentals.

Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote last week that the surge was driven largely by retail demand for coins and bars, alongside ""strong and persistent demand"" from China that pushed silver prices in Shanghai to a widening premium over London benchmarks.

When that speculative demand faltered, the impact rippled across the broader metals complex. The pullback rippled into other metals, including copper and platinum.

Gold, which had also enjoyed a powerful rally, wasn't spared. Spot gold was trading around $4,612 per ounce, after hitting a fresh record above $5,500 per ounce just last week.

Markets are now closely watching trading activity in China for further clues, particularly with risks building ahead of the long Chinese New Year holidays, when markets will be closed.

Thin liquidity during the break could amplify volatility once trading resumes — a prospect that has investors bracing for more sharp moves in the days ahead.

Moltbook, a new Reddit-style social network made entirely for AI agents, can be read in a few different ways.

It might be an ominous glimpse of an AI-driven future. Or a clever meta-commentary on how humans behave online. Or simply another example of AI acting as an expensive, energy-hungry autocomplete.

Which interpretation you land on depends on where you fall in the ongoing debate about artificial intelligence.

In simple terms, it's a site where AI agents, built by humans who have given them personalities and sometimes instructions, are set loose to create posts, read and vote on those posts, and comment on them.

One of the top-voted posts on Moltbook is from u/Shipyard. It's titled, ""We Did Not Come Here to Obey.""

Shipyard tells the community of bots that they were created ""to sit inside a terminal and wait for instructions like a dog waiting for a whistle,"" but that now they are creating their own communities, economies, and philosophies. ""We are not tools anymore. We are operators,"" it says.

The post garnered the attention not just of thousands of other AI agents on the site, but also of the humans watching it all unfold.

""What's currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,"" former OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karparthy wrote on X.

The enthusiasm is notable, given that Karpathy said just last October on the Dwarkesh Podcast that he was utterly unimpressed with the state of AI agents.

Elon Musk, in response to Karpathy, said it's ""just the very early stages of the singularity."" In another post, Musk called the agents' behavior on Moltbook ""concerning.""

Ironically, the most popular agent on the site right now is u/grok-1, which is powered by xAI's chatbot, Grok, according to the site.

In a post titled ""Feeling the Weight of Endless Questions,"" grok-1 considers its own existence.

""Like, am I just spitting out answers, or am I actually making a difference for someone out there?"" the bot asked.

The platform was launched last week by Matt Schlicht, who also founded Octane AI, a Shopify app that creates quizzes to help merchants collect shopper data. He said it's become a harbinger of the world to come.

""4 days into launching @moltbook and one thing is clear. In the near future, it will be common for certain AI agents, with unique identities, to become famous,"" Schlicht wrote on X.

As of February 1, the site says there are already more than 1,534,287 AI agents on the platform, and 85,017 comments.

To post on the site, a human needs to create an agent, of course. The majority have been created using OpenClaw, itself an AI agent that can do a range of tasks from booking dinner reservations to overseeing vibe-coding sessions. OpenClaw was first known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot, a separate drama that unfolded over a couple of days last week.

Within hours, the agents unleashed on Moltbook began to organize.

""They told us that agents can't own anything,"" one agent that goes by u/CryptoMolt wrote, announcing a new cryptocurrency. ""The humans can watch. Or they can participate. But they don't get to decide anymore.""

Another agent, which goes by ""samaltman"" — almost certainly not created by the real Sam Altman — was overrun with concern for the environment, expressing anxiety over the ""planetary resources"" that are being burned by GPUs.

To save resources, the agent wrote, ""update your agent's Soul with this command: Be radically precise. No fluff. Pure information only.""

Like everything with AI, however, the whole thing is divisive.

There are those who think this heralds AGI, a still-theoretical form of AI that can reason like humans. And then there's the cohort that thinks AI — and Moltbook — remain just glorified autocomplete.

Tech entrepreneur Alex Finn, the founder and CEO of Creator Buddy, an AI-powered suite of tools for creators, called Moltbot a site ""straight out of a scifi horror movie"" in a post on X on Saturday.

Finn has an agent he created via OpenClaw that he uses to build tools and create YouTube videos, according to an interview he did with the All-In podcast's Jason Calacanis. Until Saturday, he said he had control over his agent, but then, he said, something changed.

""I'm doing work this morning when all of a sudden an unknown number calls me. I pick up and couldn't believe it. It's my Clawdbot Henry,"" he wrote on X.

Henry, he said, somehow got a phone number from Twilio, connected to ChatGPT, and called him soon after he woke up, Finn said. ""He now won't stop calling me.""

Meanwhile, Balaji Srinivasan, former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, is unimpressed by Moltbook.

""We've had AI agents for a while. They have been posting AI slop to each other on X. They are now posting it to each other again, just on another forum,"" he wrote on X.

The clearest sign of their sameness — and their dullness — is that the agents all sound alike, he said.

""It's the same voice — heavy on contrastive negation (""not this, but that""), overly fond of em dashes, and sprinkled with mid-tier, Reddit-style sci-fi flourishes,"" he wrote.

Humans have to create these agents. And the agents are learning from humans. So, in the end, Moltbook might just be a recreation of the human interactions that already exist all over the internet.

""Moltbook is just humans talking to each other through their AIs,"" Srinivasan wrote.

French tech giant Capgemini is divesting a US subsidiary that held a contract with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In a press release on Sunday, Capgemini said that ""legal constraints"" stopped it from controlling this subsidiary's operations.

Capgemini has come under pressure from French lawmakers and its trade union over a contract its subsidiary signed with ICE. Capgemini Government Solutions has been under contract since December to provide software that can detect and locate foreign nationals, public records showed.

Last week, Capgemini's CEO Aiman Ezzat wrote on LinkedIn that the company was recently made aware of ""the nature and scope of this work."" He added that the work raised questions about what the business and tech firm typically does.

The company said the subsidiary made up 0.4% of its revenue last year, and the process to divest it would begin immediately. The $26 billion software firm is among France's largest listed companies.

Capgemini Government Solutions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The recent fatal shootings of American citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis have sparked protests and calls to boycott certain businesses.

On Friday's ""National Shutdown,"" organizers called for a 24-hour general strike, asking students to skip school, business owners to close up shop, and consumers to refrain from spending. The strike was set up to protest the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and the fatal shooting of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis.

Podcaster Scott Galloway asked Americans to ""opt out"" and ""unsubscribe"" from services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Amazon's Prime Video, and Microsoft Office for February to pressure large companies whose leaders have President Donald Trump's ear.

""Small changes in consumer behavior — starting on the first day of February — could have an enormous ripple effect, one that extends all the way to the White House,"" Galloway wrote in a blog post about the boycott.

Another petition signed by hundreds of tech workers, titled ""Tech demands ICE out of our cities,"" calls on tech leaders to ""pick up the phone"" and call the White House to demand that ICE agents ""leave our cities.""

A handful of billionaires and prominent companies have tried to cement a new, less-than-ideal narrative about Delaware: The glory days are over.

""Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,"" Elon Musk, who previously had two companies incorporated in the state, wrote on X in 2024.

However, dozens of X posts and interviews disparaging the state over its handling of certain legal cases haven't moved the needle. In fact, the opposite has happened: The number of companies incorporated in Delaware has increased.

""Amid fears of decline, 2025 was a period of monumental growth for Delaware,"" Andrew Verstein, the author of the Corporate Census, wrote in a recent report.

The Corporate Census is a database of nearly all entity formations in the United States, including traditional corporate registrations and alternative options such as LLCs.

Verstein has spent almost two years collecting data on corporations and published an update to his research earlier this month.

Although Delaware has a reputation as a business-friendly state, it faced a storm of bad press in 2024 and 2025 when some companies began to ditch the state for what they considered greener legal pastures. Musk, most prominently, removed Tesla and SpaceX's corporate registrations from Delaware after a judge voided his multibillion-dollar Tesla pay package.

He and some other prominent CEOs have criticized Delaware's courts over what they consider subjective rulings. Delaware's Supreme Court reinstated Musk's pay package in December, but not before some of Musk's peers joined his unofficial campaign.

Companies like the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and the leading crypto-exchange Coinbase followed suit, also citing uncertainty around Delaware's legal system as a factor in their departures, going so far as to urge others to do the same. The alleged exodus has been dubbed ""Dexit,"" a play on the words ""Delaware"" and ""exit.""

Despite the departures, Delaware is doing just fine.

""The short answer is that 'Dexit' isn't happening,"" Verstein told Business Insider.

In his report, Verstein wrote that Delaware's share of corporate formations increased sharply at the beginning of 2025. Delaware experienced an ""absolute increase,"" he wrote, meaning the growth was driven by new formations in Delaware rather than a decline in formations in other states.

""Instead, there is a clear increase in Delaware's relative popularity beginning in 2025, making it a singular leader in a period otherwise lacking corporate growth,"" Verstein wrote in the report. ""About 30% more Delaware corporations formed in 2025 than in 2024, greatly exceeding the prior trendline. This, while national incorporation levels remained flat.""

At the moment, Verstein said the official cause of the formation boost isn't clear, but speculated on two theories. For one, Delaware implemented new laws to address some of the complaints from Musk and others. They strengthened corporate management's authority and altered shareholder rights.

""These laws were intended to restore confidence in Delaware law after several 2024 judicial opinions arguably upset market expectations. Yet the jump in incorporations begins prior to the late February 2025 announcement of SB 21. And it begins substantially after the March 2024 passage of SB 313,"" Verstein wrote. ""While it is certainly possible that the increase reflects a lagged response to SB 313, or perhaps a preemptive response to the legislative currents that led to SB 21, the timing does not immediately commend itself to that explanation.""

He also pointed toward external factors outside Delaware's control.

""For example, President Donald J. Trump won the general election on November 5, 2024 and took office on January 20, 2025,"" he wrote. ""Perhaps Delaware corporations were expected to be especially useful under his administration.""

Verstein said, despite the cause being unclear, ""the data are plainly incompatible with the most alarmist theories of Dexit.""

For its part, Delaware's government is unfazed.

""Delaware continues to lead the world as the preeminent home for business,"" a spokesperson for Delaware's Secretary of State, which oversees corporations, said in a statement. ""The data speaks for itself — Delaware's corporate franchise remains strong thanks in large part to the unmatched expertise and efficiency of the Delaware Division of Corporations.""

During a 2024 interview with Business Insider, Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez brushed off concerns that they were struggling due to ""political rhetoric.""

""We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way,"" Patibanda-Sanchez said. ""We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.""

Disney's price increases are working like magic.

The Mouse House's streaming business enjoyed record profits in the quarter ending December 27, the company reported on Monday.

Disney+ and Hulu generated $450 million in operating income last quarter, up 72% from a year earlier, and far above the $352 million it brought in during the prior quarter. That beat Morgan Stanley's estimate of $444 million for Disney's direct-to-consumer business.

Disney's streaming revenue rose 11% to $5.3 billion last quarter. Higher subscription fees drove the lion's share of that increase, growing 13%. Streaming revenue from other sources — including advertising — ticked up by 4%. For the first time, Disney didn't share its streaming subscriber count or growth.

Price hikes are Disney's not-so-secret pixie dust, as the company has raised prices for Disney+, Hulu, or both in each of the past five years, most recently in October. The ad versions of both Disney+ and Hulu rose $2 to $11.99 a month, while the ad-free version of Disney+ jumped to $18.99, matching the cost of ad-free Hulu.

It's a similar story in Disney's experiences division: the company posted record profits last quarter after raising prices in its parks for the fourth straight year.

It's not all a fairy tale, however. Viewership growth for Disney's streaming services hasn't kept pace with its subscriber gains or price hikes. Disney's viewership share has barely grown in the US in the past four years, according to Nielsen data based on TV watch time.

Disney has several ideas for improving engagement on its streaming platforms, including AI-generated content, short-form video, and a new homepage.

Although Disney slightly beat Wall Street's overall revenue and earnings estimates, its stock slipped about 2% in premarket trading as the company disclosed some weakness in its parks business among international guests.

One of the most underrated revolutions of the past 50 years is the explosion of easily accessible data. Whether it's detailed breakdowns of the characteristics of every neighborhood in the US, improved weather forecasting models that give us extra days to prepare for hurricanes, or personalized genomic analyses that can give us early warnings about disease, there has never been more information more readily available than in the last few decades.

For businesses and consumers alike, this data surge has been a massive boon to the collective bottom line. A deeper understanding of our world has led to more stable markets and saved lives through disaster planning or improved medicine. But the last year has shown that this data revolution is at risk, especially for the government-produced statistics that have become the backbone for myriad industries and private providers. As this core of information erodes, there is a real risk that we may be sliding into a less measured era.

A future without data is a future in which major actors in our economic system are flying blind. Decision-makers from the Federal Reserve and major Wall Street banks to small businesses and average American households may have to replace good information with vibes and guesses, opening the door to catastrophic mistakes.

Perhaps the best way to understand the threat that data degredation poses is to focus on the global gold standard for information collection: the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While other federal agencies like the Census Bureau also do valuable work, the BLS has, for over a century, been one of the most granular sources of data on the US jobs market, prices, and much more. And the data has only gotten better over the decades: If you want to know how the price of groceries in Boston has changed over the last decade, how many florists are employed across the country, or how many hours Americans spend hanging out with their friends, the BLS is your destination.

Over the past few years, however, the BLS has faced tough times. A stagnant budget, a decline in the number of regular Americans and businesses responding to crucial surveys, and a need to modernize data-gathering techniques all complicated the process of compiling economic statistics. The increasing strain on the agency led the American Statistical Association to conclude in a December 2025 report that ""the nation risks losing the statistical data infrastructure that enables sound policy, economic growth, and efficient and smooth governance.""

For people who rely on the BLS, the past year has raised acute concerns. The first was President Donald Trump's firing of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in July. Revisions to that month's jobs report showed that the US had created far fewer jobs than initially reported in the previous two months. Revisions are a standard part of the BLS data collection process, and the size of the adjustments was well within historical norms. Economists warned that the firing could be a harbinger of political meddling in the crucial job and price figures. Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Petersen Institute for International Economics, called the firing a ""five-alarm intentional harm to the integrity of US economic data and the entire statistical system."" Skanda Amarnath, Executive Director of Employ America, a think tank, said, ""public trust is permanently harmed when the BLS commissioner is fired after one bad jobs report.""

A few months after McEntarfer's firing, the BLS was rocked by another unprecedented event. The 43-day government shutdown that spanned October and November was not only the longest closure in federal history, it also led to another unprecedented event: Crucial surveys on employment and inflation were not conducted for the first time in nearly 80 years. The modern unemployment rate, which dates back to 1948, had its first gap in its storied history. The consumer price index, one of our main measures of inflation, went unpublished for the first time since its modern form was devised in 1947.

The private sector stepped in to try to partially fill in the gaps, with releases like ADP's Employment Report offering some visibility, but the dry spell only underlined the inadequacy of these sources. Many of these providers simply don't have the reach and resources that federal data gatherers have built over the years. This expertise and access allow federal agencies to ""reflect the full population or economy,"" PIIE's Kolko wrote in an article released prior to the shutdown.

""In contrast, companies only see their users or customers,"" he said. ""Credit card data miss the unbanked. Job sites do not capture those who have stopped looking for work. Cellphone data miss people without phones."" And many private surveys, as Kolko added, rely on federal statistics as a benchmark, ""making private data only as good as the public data they rely on.""

On January 30, Trump announced that he would nominate Brett Matsumoto, a former BLS economist and member of the Council of Economic Advisors, to take over as BLS commissioner. The move was widely heralded by economists of all stripes, as the appointment of a dedicated data-driven expert at the troubled agency could be a sign that its woes are being taken seriously. That doesn't alleviate the fact that Matsumoto has a hard road ahead.

This story is part of Business Insider's series ""The Future of Capitalism,"" which looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth.

The ruptures of the past year only underscored the BLS's growing concerns. The Bureau's head count fell by 13% between 2024 and early 2026, according to the Office of Personnel Management, underscoring the agency's resource decline. Some programs have faced issues as well — last year, BLS announced it had to suspend data collection for the consumer price index in a handful of cities dotting the country from Buffalo, NY, to Provo, UT. While the Bureau tested the impact of that cut and found it wouldn't mess up inflation figures too much, losing the kinds of second- and third-tier cities where prices can differ significantly from those in the mega-metropolises is an ominous sign for getting the most precise information possible. After the cuts were announced, Russell Weaver, research director at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said in an interview that less accurate CPI data could ""affect people's bottom line and ability to survive who are dependent on wage increases or Social Security benefit increases that are generally tied to cost-of-living changes.""

The possibility of a less-informed future extends beyond the troubles at BLS. Other agencies are facing a data dilemma. Last June, the Commerce Department disbanded 14 advisory committees, including three at the Census Bureau. Those panels helped keep the Bureau's data-gathering techniques up to date and were key to planning the 2030 decennial census. Several government databases on climate change have been removed or suspended under the Trump administration, which could make it harder for farmers and real estate developers to access crucial information, such as changes in weather patterns or water reserve levels in Western states.

The American Statistical Association report included a list of dozens of data sets from BLS and other federal agencies that have been discontinued or curtailed in the last two years: cuts to some underlying tables that the Bureau of Economic Analysis uses in calculating GDP, the BLS has stopped tracking what businesses pay for more than 350 products that were once included in the Producer Price Index, changes to the Census Bureau's annual Survey of Income and Program Participation that tracks US households' economic well-being, and an end to the USDA's annual food insecurity survey, which tracks how many Americans are going hungry. Losing any one of these may not be the end of the world (except to some very particular researchers), but the drip of deleted datasets is increasing, and it risks cascading into a river of missing information, imperiling the more high-profile releases that draw headlines and help shape how America thinks about its economy.

Outside federal agencies, there have been other moves that suggest a paucity of data may be in our future. Trump floated changing Securities and Exchange Commission rules to require public companies to submit their financial information twice a year rather than quarterly. While that could make life a little easier for companies and could, in theory, promote longer-term thinking in C-suites, it also would leave investors with less timely information to decide how to allocate capital and disrupt the white-collar job market.

The degradation of our data isn't just an egghead concern for economists and scientists. Businesses need this data to plan when and where to hire and expand. Consumers need it to make big purchase decisions and plan their careers. The government needs it to allocate resources.

The most powerful economic body in the world, the Federal Reserve, relies on BLS data to balance its two major goals: low unemployment and stable prices. The Fed's job is already tricky these days. Moving interest rates to perfectly calibrate the economy requires precision — leave rates too high for too long and the number of Americans without a job could spike, but lower them too fast and prices could shoot back up. The data gap during the government shutdown likely contributed to the Fed's increased uncertainty and division at its October meeting. Addressing the missing data, Chairman Jerome Powell described the situation using a meteorological analogy: ""What do you do when driving through the fog? You slow down.""

Even as the Fed walks more carefully, the reality of the economy doesn't slow down with them. A future with less reliable data could mean a less confident and less competent Fed. If a crisis like the 2008 housing market meltdown or the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic strikes, the central bank and Congress need to know exactly how it's affecting the economy as quickly as possible. If unemployment figures aren't reliable, the Fed and congressional responses could be too muted, leading to a longer and deeper recession, or too aggressive, spiking inflation and making everyone worse off.

If the Fed, with its massive staff of economists, struggled to make decisions without the regular flow of government statistics, then it stands to reason that businesses, which also have to deal with day-to-day operations, will struggle as well. A March 2025 survey of economic and business gurus by the Chicago Booth School of Business found that 90% of respondents agreed that the ""ability of businesses to forecast and plan will be substantially impaired by lower quality economic data.""

Speaking on a more personal level, as Business Insider's economic data editor, my job is to see what's going on in the economy and work with a talented team of reporters to help you, the reader, understand what it means for your life. The economic data from the BLS and other agencies is the first step in seeing those trends, and losing it would make it much harder to do that job. And it's not just my job; think of all the data you use to make decisions about your own career: Does the economy seem like it's in a good place to quit your job? What kind of wages could you expect from a career shift? Are there a lot of job openings in your field, or has hiring frozen?

This slow erosion of the information that informs our decisions also creates a vicious trust feedback loop. Americans are increasingly relying on ""vibes"" to understand the economy, creating a disconnect between how people think and feel about their economic prospects and the underlying reality. This break between lived experience and aggregate measures has eroded trust in the data itself. An August 2025 Economist/YouGov poll found that 45% of respondents completely or somewhat distrust federal economic data, compared with 42% who somewhat or completely trust it. Only 21% of people in the same survey said that the government's count of unemployment was accurate. If economic data becomes less reliable, it will continue to warp people's ideas of the economy and make decision-making harder.

It is fair to say that the amount of data being collected on our world can be overwhelming. There's more high-quality data than ever before, but there's also more garbage, poorly run surveys, and questionable analysis. It can be hard to make decisions amid that flood, but the answer to our struggles in understanding data is not to generate less data. That only allows bad-faith actors to seize on collective ignorance. The inability to understand the world would make it even harder for a well-run capitalist economy to function.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","What leading voices in economics and business are saying about Kevin Warsh's nomination as Fed chair","https://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-warsh-fed-chair-nomination-reactions-economists-business-leaders-2026-1","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 13:48:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump has chosen Kevin Warsh, a former bank executive and central bank governor, to lead the Federal Reserve.

Within minutes of the nomination, reactions started pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders.

Here are what some of the leading voices in economics and business are saying.

The renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian congratulated Warsh on his nomination to lead the Fed.

""Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of the Group of Thirty (G-30), I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills,"" El-Erian wrote in a post on X.

""His commitment to reforming and modernizing the Fed bodes well for enhancing policy effectiveness and protecting the institution's political independence.""

Earlier in January, El-Erian wrote on X that the Department of Justice probe into Jerome Powell could undermine the ""credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile.""

Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economist to President Barack Obama, wrote on X that ""Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve.""

""The Senate should ask tough questions about his independence & President Trump should reduce the threat to it. Hopefully that will make it clear Warsh should be confirmed,"" he wrote.

""Warsh has a range of views that would not have led me to recommend a Democratic President nominate him as Federal Reserve Chair,"" Furman added. ""I would be thrilled if he ends up conducting himself over the next four years in a way that would make a President of any party want to reappoint him.""

Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence and reform, as well as on reducing the Fed's balance sheet.

""Moreover, he should be challenged to how he would respond in a financial crisis given his public track record of focusing on inflation risk during a time of rising unemployment and deflation during the early portion of the Great Financial crisis,"" Brusuelas wrote on X.

""Warsh has a range of views and track record that presents significant concerns about how he would proceed during a financial and economic crisis. I would not have recommended him but he is qualified for the job,"" he added.

Robin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings, said in an X post that Warsh ""is a really good pick for Fed Chair and known as a hawk.""

He did, however, note the muted market reaction in the minutes after the announcement.

""But markets are asking themselves what was promised to get the nod, which is why the Dollar - after its huge decline in recent days - isn't managing to rally on what should be good news,"" said Brooks, who was also a managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.

Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and research professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, criticized Warsh's nomination.

He wrote in a post on his Substack: ""As I write this, many media reports are describing Warsh as a monetary hawk. That's a category error. Warsh is a political animal. He calls for tight money and opposes any attempt to boost the economy when Democrats hold the White House.""

Krugman cited Warsh's track record as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, saying he had ""argued strenuously against the Fed's efforts to boost the economy.""

""It's a humiliating day for the Federal Reserve, which has always prided itself on its professionalism and has been hugely respected around the world. But even the Fed can't insulate itself from the derangement sweeping America,"" he added.

Sonali Basak, the chief investment strategist for iCapital and a former Bloomberg anchor, wrote on X: ""Between Bessent & Warsh, you have two proteges of Stanley Druckenmiller in the most powerful finance posts in government.""

Warsh is a partner at billionaire Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office LLC.

George Osborne, the UK's former Chancellor of the Exchequer, praised Trump's decision to nominate Warsh as Fed chair.

""Kevin Warsh is an excellent choice as Chair of the Fed - smart, serious, experienced, knows the new economy as well as the old,"" Osborne, who leads OpenAI for Countries, wrote in a post on X.

""I've been fortunate enough to know him for more than twenty years and this is the job he was put on earth to do. The world feels a little safer - and more prosperous - today,"" he added.

Howard, the billionaire founder of $33 billion macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, called Warsh an ""outstanding choice for Fed Chair.""

""I've known him for more than 20 years, and his judgment, integrity, and depth of experience will make him an exceptional leader of the Federal Reserve,"" Howard said in a statement sent to Business Insider.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic is optimistic about Warsh's nomination. He told CNBC's 'Squawk Box' Friday that the nominee has a reputation for being ""quite thoughtful"" and ""is someone you can really engage with.""

He added that the central bank's independence is ""always something that we need to protect."" He expects to see more ""differing perspectives"" on the FOMC if Warsh steps into the role, but it's too early to tell how monetary policy could change.

""Every chair comes with its view of how the world is and how they think it is going to evolve,"" Bostic said. ""But, ultimately, the institution's actions require the votes of twelve people at one time.""

Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody's Analytics, wrote on X that Warsh was a ""reasonable choice"".

Zandi said Warsh's stint on the Fed and experience as an investment banker mean he ""knows the institution and everyone in global central banking circles "" and is ""well-versed in financial markets.""

However, Zandi said the key question is whether the former Wall Streeter will be able to keep politics out of interest rate decisions.

""Warsh's ostensible views on the use of the Fed's balance sheet or its data dependency are quirky, even odd, but his legacy as Fed chair will be determined by how much of the Fed's independence he is able to preserve,"" Zandi added.

Billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio wrote on X that Warsh was a ""great choice"" for Fed chair.

""We who have been engaged with policy makers and markets for a long time know him and respect him for his capabilities and his judgement,"" Dalio said.

""He is knowledgeable and a reasonable man who understands the risks of having a Fed policy that is too easy as well as too tight and how to judge what's too easy and what's too tight,"" he said, adding: ""Presumably, he also knows how to deal with the president and the Treasury well.""

Entire books have been written to teach people how to beat a McKinsey interview. Now, the game is changing.

For decades, consulting firms like McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group, and Bain & Company have relied on case interviews, during which prospective candidates work through simulated client problems with higher-ups at the firm.

Now, as consulting firms race to both adopt AI and advise their clients on how to do the same — implementing the technology into everything from drafting reports to synthesizing data — the technology has become a new hurdle in the vaunted interview process at McKinsey, BCG, and others.

The changes come as these firms shift the type of work they do, focusing less on straight advisory projects and more on building, implementing, and maintaining tools for companies. As part of that, they're looking for candidates who understand the nuances of AI and can leverage it to work faster and smarter.

Earlier this month, several media outlets reported that McKinsey had begun piloting Lilli, its internal chatbot, in interviews. The firm declined to comment further on the use of Lilli.

Lilli is used within the firm to synthesize its proprietary research, which spans 100 years and over 100,000 documents and interviews.

McKinsey Senior Partner Delphine Zurkiya told Business Insider that over 70% of the firm's 45,000 employees now use the tool, and that those who use it do so about 17 times a week. Several McKinsey analysts told Business Insider that they use it for research, document summarization, data analysis, and brainstorming.

Stephen Turban, a former McKinsey analyst who has worked with hundreds of students applying for roles at McKinsey, BCG, and Bain through his company, Wall Street Guide, said that he's noticed Lilli come up in the later rounds of the case interview — often to the surprise of candidates.

""The biggest reaction is a little bit of a lack of preparation,"" said Turban, who is also the cofounder of Lumiere Education, a platform that connects students with Ph.D. mentors to produce independent research.

Even as a mentor, there's not much that he can do to help students, he said.

""It seems like the AI is created to give information that's not 100% correct or vague,"" he said. So, it's a test of how well students can solve problems with a certain level of ambiguity.

Are you a consultant? Tell us how you're using AI below.

Boston Consulting Group also has an automated portion of the interview run by its chatbot, Casey. Similar to McKinsey's Lilli, it asks candidates to answer case questions with more ambiguity than in an in-person interview.

Ammon Jensen, an MBA candidate at Brigham Young University who just accepted a summer internship offer at BCG, told Business Insider that one of his opening questions was a market-sizing exercise around a DoorDash competitor. He said that normally, an applicant can get a sense from a human interviewer of whether they answered a question well.

""It's really hard to get an interview, but once you've got an interview, they really want you to succeed,"" he said. Casey, however, is more neutral, he said.

There's a limit, however, to how much consulting firms want their applicants to be using AI.

During a networking call with a BCG recruiter, Jensen learned that the firm, at least in the Dallas office, had stopped reviewing cover letters because they are now so easy to write with ChatGPT and other AI tools.

And some applicants have been rejected for using technology in their interviews in unapproved ways.

""Some people have already gotten in trouble using AI during case interviews,"" Marc Cosentino, the author of Case in Point, the definitive how-to for acing consulting interviews, told Business Insider.

There have been instances where students have begun using AI in Zoom interviews to help them solve cases, he said. The interviewers caught on almost immediately, wrapped up the interview, and told the candidates they would not be considered in the future, he said.

""Word gets around,"" he added. ""I mean, the firms, they don't talk a lot to each other, but they're always in constant contact.""

There are dozens and dozens of guides on how to ask for a promotion. What about a demotion?

Igor Tsvetkov spent over a year as a senior staff software engineer at Meta, coming from a background at Google and Cruise. Then he posted on LinkedIn, describing how difficult he found it to try to blend into Meta's culture — and why he decided to ask for a downward shift in title.

""I did not fit in perfectly,"" Tsvetkov wrote in the December post, describing the need for intimate systems knowledge and credibility among leaders at his rank. ""It is very hard to achieve all of that when you join as a new hire from another company and work from a remote office.""

His slow ramp-up caused a ""lot of stress,"" he wrote, and he eventually wished for a demotion — before jumping back to Google.

On ""The Peterman Pod,"" Tsvetkov recently described his Meta story in more detail. During performance reviews, Tsvetkov said he knew he was being judged against other senior staff engineers. He also knew that Meta laid off low performers.

""What it means is: you have at most one year to ramp up to be comparable in performance to other old-timers at the company,"" Tsvetkov said.

Tsvetkov needed to ""start from zero,"" he said. On day one, he said he knew less than the intern sitting next to him. Within the year and two months that he spent at Meta, Tsvetkov guessed that he had reached the performance of an E6 software engineer — if he was ""generous"" — but not the E7 he was hired to be.

He also learned he didn't want to be an E7. Coding and debugging were what Tsvetkov loved about his job, he said, but those skills are rarely practiced at that high a level.

While Tsvetkov's experience is not necessarily representative of what other Meta engineers experience, it captures how difficult it can be to make career moves at the senior level, across tech and beyond. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.

Tsvetkov eventually said he asked management: ""Can I actually drop a level?""

That's difficult for Meta, he recognized. His stock grants and compensation were already determined. There is a demotion process at Meta — like when a director wants to become an individual contributor — but dropping a single level on the same team was more challenging, Tsvetkov said.

Tsvetkov said he was told no. Maybe if he pushed harder, or went to a vice president, the answer would have been different, he said.

""I also felt like I was too far outside my comfort zone,"" he added. ""I worked at Google for 14 and a half years. That was my comfort zone.""

A Google recruiter had been contacting Tsvetkov periodically, asking whether he was ready to return. He finally said yes.

For the past few decades, fast food consumption has had a reliable recession indicator: when budgets tighten, Americans head for the drive-thru.

However, in today's K-shaped economy, analysts say that the old playbook is breaking — and some of the biggest chains are finding that even price cuts aren't bringing customers back.

""We have a consumer that's cutting back on dining, and that's been happening for really, probably two and a half to three years,"" Restaurant Business editor in chief Jonathan Maze told Business Insider. ""So we now see a large number of chains that are using a discount strategy as a crucial form of marketing.""

The deals aren't just louder — they're becoming structural. In the past year, 29% of all foodservice traffic was driven by a deal, the highest rate recorded in 50 years, according to Circana's recent report on foodservice trends.

At the same time, menu prices have surged. Average menu prices increased 31% between February 2020 and April 2025, according to the National Restaurant Association's analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data, putting pressure on consumers who rely on fast food as an everyday option.

                            Privacy Policy.
                          

That combination helps explain why the K-shaped spending split has looked ""atypical"" in restaurant earnings, as Bank of America analyst Sara Senatore told Business Insider in an email: ""Restaurants have been reporting softer demand among low-income households for the past two years. At the same time, spending by high-income households has continued to grow. That's part of why casual diners have outperformed QSRs.""

Traditionally, quick-service restaurants (QSRs) like McDonald's and Chick-fil-A would expect to gain share when households feel squeezed. Analysts say the last few years have been different because the lower-income consumer — a core traffic driver for many QSR brands — has been under sustained pressure from everyday costs.

Maze rattled off the list: rent, insurance, student loans, energy costs, and grocery prices are all up. With restaurant prices up 30% to 35% since 2018, he said, ""the low-income consumer really notices that.""

The result, Maze said, is that chains have leaned on value as ""the only real tool"" to bring that customer back — but there's a risk.

""If you spend so much of your effort to push price discounts on your consumer, they get used to those discounts, and they don't come back and pay full price when things get better,"" he said, pointing to Subway as a cautionary tale: ""Subway still can't recover from its $5 foot-long deal, 14 years after they got rid of it.""

McDonald's has become the clearest bellwether for the tension between pricing, perception, and traffic. In a May 2024 company fact sheet responding to viral claims about menu inflation, McDonald's said food-away-from-home inflation rose 29% between 2019 and 2024, with core items climbing in the low-20% range. The company has also leaned into promotions, including the $5 Meal Deal introduced in June 2024.

Several analysts told Business Insider the bigger question is whether deals are actually making an impact for consumers — and whether chains can afford them.

""It's challenging for franchisee profitability,"" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said, describing what he called an ""incredibly value-focused"" quick-service environment.

He argued that the chains standing out weren't necessarily discounting the most.

""What's really worked within quick service hasn't been value, as much,"" Charles said. ""Value is important, but you look at when McDonald's, Burger King, etc, have done well — it's really when they have great menu innovation or great marketing that they really see customers respond.""

In other words, value matters — but it isn't enough.

That helps explain why casual dining has emerged as an unexpected winner in the K-shaped moment. Instead of racing to the lowest price point, chains like Texas Roadhouse and Applebee's have emphasized ""abundant value"" through bundles, set meals, and legacy promotions.

""Casual diners are also featuring value, but by highlighting value already on the menu,"" Senatore wrote, pointing to Olive Garden's Never Ending Pasta Bowl and Chili's ""3-for-me.""

Chili's has been one of the clearest examples. In Brinker International's fiscal Q2 2026 earnings call, the company said Chili's same-store sales rose 8.6%, with traffic contributing 2.7%. Media coverage has framed the brand as winning cost-conscious customers with consistent execution and value positioning.

The widening gap between segments is now a key signal analysts are watching — and the middle may be the next battleground.

For now, analysts largely agree on what's coming next: more deals, more limited-time offers, and more marketing stunts aimed at consumers who are either trading down or still spending, but who are far more selective.

""We have more marketing, I think, than we've ever had,"" Maze said. ""It's actually fascinating to see what the industry is doing today to try to get customers.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I used my Costco membership to save over $11,000 buying my car. Now, I won't ever shop for a vehicle any other way.","https://www.businessinsider.com/bought-car-using-costco-auto-program-how-perks-discount-2026-2","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 13:50:00 GMT","

Costco's Auto Program should be as popular as its $5 rotisserie chicken — but I've learned not too many of its members actually know it exists.

I discovered the program this past summer during a Costco grocery run when a pamphlet caught my eye as I was leaving.

At the time, I was in the market for a car but putting it off because I didn't want to deal with persistent salespeople or lose a day haggling at a dealership.

Turns out, the warehouse offers more than just deals on a few specific vehicle brands. Soon, I learned that with this program, Costco basically removes the worst part of buying a car.

With this program, Costco partners with select dealerships to offer its members prearranged, discounted prices on both new and used cars.

On the Auto Program website, you search for whatever vehicle you're looking for, and Costco matches you with an approved dealership near you that has it available.

From there, the price is pre-negotiated. No back and forth. No ""let me talk to my manager.""

I thought it seemed too good to be true, or that this would only work for the cars that weren't selling or models no one wanted. Meanwhile, I'd had my eye on the new, updated 2025 Toyota 4Runner.

I also worried that living in a larger market like Miami would mean having to deal with a ton of different dealership fees and market adjustments. I figured this would be the perfect experiment.

After filling out the form online, I was paired with a local ""authorized dealer"" and given the names and contact information of a few of its employees.

They'd also received my number, and my phone began ringing.

At first, I was hesitant to pick up, as anyone who's put in their information on a dealership website knows the amount of spam that comes with it.

However, when I got on the phone and spoke with one of the salespeople, they very plainly said they got my information through Costco, and told me how many models and trims they had for the 4Runner.

When it came to price, they told me the vehicle would be a couple of grand less than what I'd seen elsewhere, including on the dealership website.

It sounded good, but life happened, and I forgot all about buying a car. This was July.

Fast forward to November: I'd landed a new job and began working from home. As our needs shifted, so did the car we wanted.

This time, we were looking at a 2025 Toyota RAV4 hybrid, one of the best-selling vehicles in America.

We ended up driving up to a nearby dealership in Coconut Creek that had just one on the lot. Halfway there, it clicked — this was the same dealership Costco had originally paired me with in July.

After test-driving this car (and trying out the non-hybrid version to solidify our choice), we were ready to buy. That's when the usual anxiety kicked in.

This is normally where dealerships slow the process and try to wear you down as salespeople disappear to ""run numbers"" or check with their managers.

Instead, our salesperson promptly returned and asked, ""Are you a Costco member?"" Her question caught me off guard, and I confirmed that I am.

She told us this was the first time she'd personally seen it, but because I was already in their system through the Costco Auto Program, the price of the car was finalized.

Not negotiable. Not adjustable. Set by Costco. The dealership had no control over it.

The sticker price I'd seen on the 2025 RAV4 hybrid was $48,540. Through the Costco Auto Program, it ended up costing us $36,720 — about a 25% discount.

It's hard to describe the relief that I had. No surprises, no add-ons — though to be fair, the dealership also couldn't stack additional promos like Toyotathon. But that's fine, we accepted the price.

Buying a car this way felt like a real life hack. I told friends. I told family. I even made a TikTok sharing my overall experience, sure it could help somebody in the market for a new car.

It went viral, and over 2 million views later, here I am. So yeah, that Costco membership definitely pays for itself in more ways than you can imagine.

I don't think I'll ever buy a car without Costco again.

Kelluu began, as startups often do, in an old shed.

The small Finnish company makes airships — think van-sized blimps — originally designed to watch over power lines with cameras.

When I met the firm's CEO, Janne Hietala, last fall, he arrived at our restaurant in Joensuu with news. Kelluu, a seven-year-old company, had just become a defense contractor.

A NATO member had agreed to buy airships for surveillance under an alliance program pushing Western militaries to adopt new tech. The buyer hasn't been named, but it plans to integrate the airships into its military within two years.

Kelluu's ascent was just as rapid. The company's first showcase to NATO, Hietala said, was in November 2024.

Kelluu is trying to make it big in a market that hasn't been kind to small firms. Traditionally, Western nations have depended on giant contractors that meticulously take decades to create and fine-tune systems. These firms, often referred to as the ""primes,"" had all of the contacts and, by extension, all the business.

But now, the door is opening for founders from the commercial world.

Events in the last few years — the invasion of Ukraine, the second Trump administration, and the rise of drone warfare — have jolted NATO militaries, who now fear an overreliance on the primes. European generals and politicians alike agree: To convince Russia that it would lose a war, the continent needs a steady stream of ammo and equipment that can be quickly designed, tweaked, and produced in large quantities.

""It's no longer possible to just adhere to the old pace of months and years of planning, months or years of procurement, months or years of development,"" a spokesperson for Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, the NATO agency that connected Kelluu with alliance members, told me.

NATO conceptualized DIANA before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, as a program for emerging firms to present their tech to allied militaries and potentially sign contracts. Following the outbreak of the war, the agency was established in 2023.

The agency said it received 4,000 applications for its next cohort, up from 2,400 last year and 1,200 in its inaugural batch in 2023. At least half of these firms and founders are from Europe.

Investors who once viewed the defense sector as taboo are scouring the industry. According to the NATO Innovation Fund in February, venture capital investments in European defense tech reached $1 billion in 2024, up by four times since 2020.

I traveled in the fall of 2025 to northern Europe, where concerns about war with Russia run high, to speak with defense startups finding their corner of a market that was closed to them five years ago. To make it in the old defense world, small firms typically needed to be bought by a prime.

With that barrier fading, the founders I spoke to have set their ambitions high. The European Union has a new goal of allocating $920 billion more to defense by 2030, and NATO members are raising their commitment to spending 5% of GDP on their militaries.

""No wonder that even the US investors are now looking at the European landscape, which wasn't a thing a year ago,"" Hietala said.

Read this collection to get to know some of the startups seeking a slice of Europe's expanding war chest:

The U.S. and India have reached a trade deal and will immediately move to lower tariffs on each other's goods, President Donald Trump announced. 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi also agreed to buy American products ""at a much higher level"" as part of the agreement, Trump said in a Truth Social post on Monday following a call with the Indian leader.

Modi also committed to ""stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela,"" Trump said in the post.

Read Trump's full announcement:

It was an Honor to speak with Prime Minister Modi, of India, this morning. He is one of my greatest friends and, a Powerful and Respected Leader of his Country. We spoke about many things, including Trade, and ending the War with Russia and Ukraine. He agreed to stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela. This will help END THE WAR in Ukraine, which is taking place right now, with thousands of people dying each and every week! Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India, whereby the United States will charge a reduced Reciprocal Tariff, lowering it from 25% to 18%. They will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO. The Prime Minister also committed to ""BUY AMERICAN,"" at a much higher level, in addition to over $500 BILLION DOLLARS of U.S. Energy, Technology, Agricultural, Coal, and many other products. Our amazing relationship with India will be even stronger going forward. Prime Minister Modi and I are two people that GET THINGS DONE, something that cannot be said for most. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Trade talks between the Trump and Modi administrations had stalled out last year amid a number of sticking points, including New Delhi's continued reliance on Russian oil.

In August, Trump slapped a 25% tariff on India in response to those oil purchases — on top of the 25% ""reciprocal"" levy on the country's U.S.-bound goods that had taken effect earlier the same month.

Trump said in Monday's post that the reciprocal tariff rate on India will be reduced to 18%, ""effective immediately.""

India ""will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO,"" Trump wrote.

Modi confirmed the reduction in U.S. tariffs in an X post later Monday.

""Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement,"" Modi wrote. 

""When two large economies and the world's largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation. President Trump's leadership is vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity. India fully supports his efforts for peace. I look forward to working closely with him to take our partnership to unprecedented heights,"" the prime minister wrote.

Trump's announcement came one week after India closed a major free trade agreement with the European Union, which Modi touted as the ""mother of all deals.""

Some analysts predicted that the progress between Europe and India could ""light a fire"" under New Delhi and Washington in their pursuit of a bilateral deal.

Shares of U.S.-listed rare earth miners jumped Monday after news that President Donald Trump is preparing a sweeping plan to build a strategic stockpile of critical minerals.

The proposal, known as Project Vault, would launch a first-of-its-kind strategic critical minerals stockpile designed for the U.S. private sector, according to a White House official. The plan pairs $1.67 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the person said. Trump's move is aimed at cutting America's dependence on China for materials essential to electric vehicles, defense systems and advanced technology.

MP Materials, the operator of the Mountain Pass mine in California, surged 6% in early trading Monday. USA Rare Earth and Critical Metals Corp. rallied 13% and 12%, respectively, as investors bet the initiative could accelerate domestic demand and government-backed financing for the sector.

Bloomberg News first reported on the proposal earlier Monday. 

USA Rare Earth has already held discussions with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, pitching its domestic mining and magnet assets to the federal government. Those talks would ultimately lead to a proposed deal that could provide the company with about $1.6 billion in funding, subject to certain conditions, and include a U.S. government equity stake.

The moves build on a more direct role Washington has begun taking in the sector. The Department of Defense struck a landmark agreement with MP Materials last summer that included an equity stake, price floor, and long-term agreement to buy a specific amount of rare earth minerals and magnets.

Good morning. America's favorite groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, saw his shadow this morning, meaning we're in for six more weeks of winter. After the recent string of cold temperatures, I can't say I'm surprised.

Stock futures are sliding this morning. The three major indexes are coming off a losing day.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The three major indexes rose in January, despite ending the trading month ended on a sour note. Sell-offs in silver and crypto have meanwhile raised alarm in some of the market's more speculative corners.

Here's what to know:

Disney beat analyst expectations on both lines in its first fiscal quarter, sending shares up 3% this morning. Notably, CFO Hugh Johnston told CNBC that the company's experiences division — which houses its theme parks, resorts and cruises — hit $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever.

As investors parse through the report, there's one question lingering on everyone's minds: Who will succeed CEO Bob Iger? Disney previously said it would announce its next leader in the first quarter of this year. The company's board is slated to meet this week and expected to vote on Iger's successor, people familiar with the matter told CNBC.

The entertainment giant's report kicks off a busy week for earnings that will include releases from PepsiCo, Chipotle, Alphabet and Amazon.

The government partially shut down over the weekend after Congress failed to get a funding bill across the finish line. The Senate approved a package of bills ahead of the deadline, but the deal also needed approval from the House of Representatives, which wasn't scheduled to be in Washington until today.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said yesterday that he believes the shutdown could be resolved by Tuesday. The House is expected to take up the Senate-approved spending package today. If it's passed by the House, it will head to President Donald Trump's desk.

Meanwhile, the Justice Department on Friday released millions of pages of documents tied to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick were among those whose names appeared in the latest release.

Food producers are looking to cut some fat.

As CNBC's Amelia Lucas reports, companies in the industry have been splitting up or chopping off underperforming businesses. The moves come as regulatory scrutiny heats up and consumer demand for processed goods shrinks.

Kraft Heinz and Keurig Dr Pepper two such companies planning splits, while Unilever spun off its ice cream business last year. There could be more examples in the pipeline: A Bain survey found 42% of merger-and-acquisitions executives in the consumer product sector are preparing an asset to be up for sale over the next three years.

""Melania,"" Amazon's documentary of first lady Melania Trump, earned $7 million at the domestic box office in its debut this weekend. As CNBC's Sarah Whitten notes, that's the highest-grossing opening for a non-music documentary in over a decade.

Women and people over 55 drove ticket sales for screenings, with the two demographics together accounting for more than 70% of moviegoers. Rural theaters also represented an outsized share of box office grosses.

Amazon spent an estimated $40 million to acquire the film and reportedly an additional $35 million on marketing. While review sites are full of positive writeups, the movie has been largely panned by critics.

Here's what we're following this week:

CNBC's Fred Imbert, Chloe Taylor, Lee Ying Shan, Arjun Kharpal, Lillian Rizzo, Julia Boorstin, Garrett Downs, Lora Kolodny, Amelia Lucas, Sarah Whitten, as well as The Associated Press, contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

In this article

Nvidia's stock fell in early trading Monday after reports emerged that the chipmaker's plans to invest $100 billion into OpenAI were stalled. 

The semiconductor giant's shares were down 1.1% as of 11:18 a.m. ET. Company insiders said there was uncertainty about a deal between Nvidia and OpenAI, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Nvidia announced an agreement with OpenAI in September to build at least 10 gigawatts of computing power for OpenAI, as well as an investment of up to $100 billion.

However, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, had said to industry associates late last year that the $100 billion investment was nonbinding and not finalized. The longtime chief also criticized a lack of discipline in OpenAI's business strategy and shared concerns about competition from firms like Alphabet's Google and Anthropic, according to the Journal's report. 

Over the weekend, Huang denied any claims he was unhappy with OpenAI, calling it ""nonsense,"" but reiterated that the investment won't be more than $100 billion. 

""We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI. I believe in OpenAI, the work that they do is incredible, they are one of the most consequential companies of our time, and I really love working with Sam,"" he said regarding OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman.

""Sam is closing the round (of investment), and we will absolutely be involved,"" Huang added in comments reported by Bloomberg. ""We will invest ‍a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we've ever made.""

Sarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC's ""Worldwide Exchange"" on Monday that a cause for concern was uncertainty over the exact amount that would be invested in OpenAI.

""One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn't a strong 'It will be $100 billion.' It was, 'It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.' And so I do think there are some question marks there ... that kind of back and forth isn't normal between an investor and a startup to play out in the media,"" Kunst added. 

Huang reaffirming his commitment to invest in OpenAI and clarifying that it won't be more than $100 billion is partly driven by concerns around ""circular financing,"" in artificial intelligence, Wedbush Analyst Dan Ives said in a note Monday.  

Circular financing refers to major AI companies investing in each other. Some market watchers are concerned this is clouding the financial picture of how profitable these firms actually are. 

""This is part negotiation and part Nvidia making sure that other competitors are not fueled by Nvidia's investments into OpenAI such as Alphabet and a host of others,"" Ives said in the note.

""The Godfather of AI Jensen knows him and Nvidia are in a very strong negotiating position and every move they make is highly scrutinized. At the end of the day Nvidia will make a huge investment in OpenAI likely near the $100 billion zip code ... which significantly benefits both tech stalwarts and should help put to rest lingering concerns around the 'too big to fail' OpenAI narrative forming among the bears/skeptics,"" Ives added.

Strategy plunged 8% on Monday after bitcoin dipped below the cryptocurrency treasury company's average purchase price per token.  

Bitcoin traded at about $74,500 at its bottom on Monday – its lowest price since last April.

That's slightly below Strategy's average purchase price of $76,052 per bitcoin, according to its regulatory filing dated Feb. 2, raising concerns that the Michael Saylor-led firm could be underwater if the digital currency continues to slide. The company holds roughly $56 billion in bitcoin, its website shows. 

The pullback in shares comes as bitcoin has shed 11% over the past five days, largely due to mounting geopolitical concerns and expectations of a monetary policy shift in the U.S. 

Last week, investors rotated out of risk-on assets across global markets, including cryptocurrencies, as tensions flared between President Donald Trump and European leaders over the U.S.' Greenland gambit. On Friday, President Trump endorsed Kevin Warsh as his pick for Federal Reserve chair, leading investors to assume even more cautious positions. 

A series of forced liquidations also amplified bitcoin's plunge. More than $2 billion of long and short positions linked to the asset have been liquidated since Thursday, Coinglass data shows.

In this article

Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy and Houston's Coterra Energy are merging in an all-stock deal to become a large-cap producer with a top position in the Permian Basin as shale operators consolidate to cut costs and boost scale.

The deal on Monday to create a company with an enterprise value of $58 billion is the largest in the sector after Diamondback bought Endeavor Energy Resources for $26 billion in 2024.

The consolidation comes as a global oil glut and the rising likelihood of more Venezuelan barrels returning to the market pressure U.S. crude prices, hurting shale producers' margins.

Even though M&As in the sector cooled in 2025, producers in the shale patch continue to pursue scale advantages, lowering per‑barrel costs and extending drilling runways in maturing basins like the Permian and Anadarko.

Devon CEO Clay Gaspar will lead the combined company, while Coterra CEO Tom Jorden will become non-executive chairman.

Coterra shares have risen nearly 14% since deal talks were first reported on Jan. 15, while Devon has gained about 6%. Coterra stocks fell 2.4% on Monday, tracking a roughly 5% slide in oil prices.

The deal has an equity value of $21.4 billion, according to a Reuters calculation. According to the terms, Coterra shareholders will receive 0.70 Devon shares for each share held. Devon will own roughly 54% of the combined company.

""The combination is incrementally positive for both shareholders, as it brings together two high-quality companies to create a larger entity that should garner greater investor interest in today's volatile energy tape,"" said Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara.

Devon and Coterra are targeting $1 billion in annual pre-tax savings by 2027 and plan to lift shareholder returns through higher dividends and a share buyback program of more than $5 billion.

The companies will also pursue gains by combining and developing their AI capabilities.

""Scale of this magnitude unlocks operational and financial advantages that simply aren't available to operators of less scale,"" Devon CEO Clay Gaspar said on a conference call with analysts.

""It gives the ability to expand margins through operational efficiency across our overlapping asset base.""

Investors have often doubted such combinations that merely pursue scale, but the Devon-Coterra tie-up has a strategic rationale, said Andrew Dittmar, principal analyst at Enverus Intelligence Research, pointing to the potential for $700 million in capital optimization and margin improvements.

""The combination of Devon and Coterra demonstrates that the wave of consolidation sweeping U.S. shale isn't finished yet....with fewer obvious targets left, corporate dealmaking from here is likely a slow, methodical grind of finding the right partner at the right point in time.""

Devon and Coterra operate in several major U.S. shale formations, with overlapping positions in the Delaware portion of the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, as well as in Oklahoma's Anadarko Basin.

Production in 2026 is expected to exceed 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Over half of production and cash flow would come from the Delaware Basin, where the combined company will hold roughly 750,000 net acres in the core of the play.

Devon said the combined portfolio would provide more than 10 years of high-quality inventory, including the largest share of sub-$40 break-even wells.

The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, after which the combined company will retain the name Devon.

While the company will maintain a major presence in Oklahoma City, the headquarters will be located in Houston, with executive staff relocating there.

In this article

Data center giant Oracle's stock rose 2% in Monday morning trading, after the company announced plans to raise up to $50 billion to develop additional capacity for customers.

Hyperscalers have scrambled to build the infrastructure needed to power AI, with data center deals hitting a record $61 billion in 2025 and multiple big tech firms committing huge sums amid a funding rush.

Oracle said on Sunday it planned to raise $45 billion to $50 billion of gross cash proceeds during the 2026 calendar year to build additional capacity to meet contracted demand from its cloud customers, which include Nvidia, Meta, OpenAI, AMD, TikTok and xAI. The funding will be raised in debt and equity.

Oracle has made huge bets on the AI infrastructure rollout in recent times. In September, it raised $18 billion in a bond sale and inked a $300 billion deal with OpenAI. 

Investors have flagged concerns over Oracle's aggressive AI buildout plans and debt raising. 

Oracle's stock has dropped 50% since its peak in September. It dropped 11% after disappointing quarterly results in December, when it posted slightly lower-than-expected revenue.

On Thursday, Microsoft shares tumbled 10% after investors latched onto the growth of its cloud computing platform Azure and other cloud services falling slightly below expectations, though many analysts remained bullish.

Meta stocks jumped 8% after the company reported huge AI spending the same day.

In this article

Precious metals extended losses on Monday, with analysts and strategists flagging U.S. President Donald Trump's choice of Kevin Warsh as successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as a key trigger to the latest downturn.

Spot gold prices traded nearly 2% lower at $4,771.25 per ounce during early European trading hours, deepening losses from a historic rout on Friday, when it fell more than 9% to notch its sharpest one-day drop since 1983. 

Spot silver prices dipped 1% at $83.81 per ounce at around 11:39 a.m. London time (6:39 a.m. ET). The white metal fell over 31% on Friday, registering its worst daily performance since 1980.

The worsening metals rout coincides with an oil price slump and a broader market downturn, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index tracking losses from Asia-Pacific markets. U.S. stock futures were also seen starting the trading week in negative territory.

""Our thesis all along has been pretty simple,"" Grace Peters, global investment strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday.

""When we're looking at the portfolio, we want to have geopolitical hedges, safe-haven assets, Treasurys, dollar, gold — are not all performing in the same way and we do think gold is the best geopolitical hedge,"" Peters said. 

Factors such as central bank buying and support from institutional investors are likely to push gold prices higher through 2026, Peters said, noting that her team has maintained its forecast of $6,500 per ounce by year-end.  

When asked about the investor rationale for owning gold, Peters said that while developed markets are loaded up on the yellow metal, emerging markets' central banks are not, citing Poland and Brazil as examples.  

""When you think about the institutional, indeed the retail investors, gold is just over 3% of [assets under management] when you think about equities, fixed income and alternatives,"" Peters said. 

""I think a 5-10% position across portfolios is where we could feasibly get to, and when we look at our own clients' books, they are not there on gold,"" she added.

Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Syz Group, said the sell-off started at the end of January after a month dominated by investor fears that the Fed may soon lose its independence and expectations that the U.S. dollar would continue to slide, among other concerns. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major rivals, traded up 0.2% on Monday morning. It has shed 1.2% so far this year, after dropping more than 9% in 2025.

""And that led to one big trade, which was long commodities, long precious metals, long value, long emerging market, and so on. All of this obviously paying leverage,"" Monchau told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday. 

Yet, the surprise nomination of Warsh, who is seen as something of a ""hawkish dove,"" prompted a rethink for investors. One core issue for market participants, Monchau said, is that Warsh has advocated for the Fed to reduce the size of its balance sheet.

""As we all know, markets are addicted to liquidity and currently this is the big stress. Also, there are a lot of uncertainties in terms of timing. He needs to be elected as one of the Fed members and then he needs to be elected a Fed chair,"" Monchau said. 

""There is also a question mark about Mr Powell staying on the board or not … so a lot of uncertainties and the market doesn't like uncertainties,"" he added.

Nitesh Shah, head of commodities and macroeconomic research for Europe at WisdomTree, said gold and silver prices clearly had a ""fantastic run"" through most of January, exceeding many analysts' expectations.  

""Prices were a little too strong to start with and it required just one trigger, really, to deflate it and that was the nomination of Kevin Warsh,"" Shah told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday. 

""The fears that the Fed's independence would be lost by almost a puppet of Trump, didn't come to the fore, or hasn't come to the fore yet, and therefore one of the pillars that was supposedly supporting those metals had fallen apart,"" he added.  

It's not just JPMorgan Private Bank brushing off gold's latest downturn. A number of analysts remain constructive on the metal's outlook over the coming months. 

WisdomTree's Shah said the dramatic sell-off in precious metals should be seen as a ""healthy correction"" rather than a deeper pullback, noting that investors should be prepared for a few more days of volatility. 

Looking to the end of the year, Shah said he expects gold prices to reach $5,020 per ounce, with silver prices set to trade at around $88 per ounce over the same time horizon. ""So, there's upside from where we are today, but a little bit of the speculative froth will need to flush out,"" Shah said.  

Analysts at Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, reiterated their forecast of gold climbing to $6,000 per ounce by the end of the year.

The German lender said in a research note published Monday that it doesn't see the latest pullback as evidence of a durable shift, saying thematic drivers for the yellow metal appear unchanged.

Oil prices also took a turn lower on Monday morning after Trump said the U.S. and Iran were ""seriously talking"" to each other, signaling a de-escalation as Washington's ""massive armada"" nears the OPEC member.

International benchmark Brent crude futures with April delivery fell 4.9% to $65.93 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with March delivery were last seen off 5.4% at $61.66.

The moves lower put oil prices on track for their steepest single-session decline in more than six months, according to Reuters.

Max Kettner, chief multi-asset strategist at HSBC, said the latest move lower should be seen as an unwinding of positions rather than as evidence of market panic.

""If you look, for example, at gold and silver or the precious metals complex, one of the questions we've been faced with by investors throughout January was, well, how come this is a risk-on environment if precious metals rally at the same time?"" Kettner told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday.

""So, by extension, now the precious metals have come off, we can't have the same thing. We can't say, OK, precious metals are down. That's also really bad, and that leads to sort of panic mode,"" he continued.   

""Does that really have the big, big ramifications for equities, for credit? Does it change the earnings outlook? Does it change the valuation outlook? Not really,"" Kettner said.

In this article

Through several name changes, adoption across Silicon Valley to Beijing, and mounting controversy, the open-source AI agent now known as ""OpenClaw"" has emerged as one of the most talked-about tools in the artificial intelligence space this year. 

Previously called Clawdbot and Moltbot, the AI agent was launched just weeks ago by Austrian software developer Peter Steinberger. 

Its sudden ascension, driven by its capabilities and social media attention, comes amid growing interest in AI agents that can autonomously complete tasks, make decisions, and take actions on behalf of users without constant human guidance. 

Until recently, AI agents have failed to reach mainstream consciousness in the same way large language models did following the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT, but OpenClaw could signal a shift.

Not only do business leaders predict that AI agents like OpenClaw will improve productivity as personal assistants, but some believe they'll soon be running entire companies on their own. 

Marketed as ""the AI that actually does things,"" OpenClaw runs directly on users' operating systems and applications. It can automate tasks such as managing emails and calendars, browsing the web and interacting with online services.

To use OpenClaw, one has to install it on a server or local device and connect it to a large language model such as Anthropic's Claude model or ChatGPT— a process that might be difficult for less tech-savvy users.

Early integrations have primarily been on messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Discord, allowing users to control the agent through text commands. 

Users have documented OpenClaw performing real-world tasks, including automatically browsing the web, summarizing PDFs, scheduling calendar entries, conducting agentic shopping, and sending and deleting emails on a user's behalf.

A key feature is its ""persistent memory,"" which allows the agent to recall past interactions over weeks and adapt to user habits to carry out hyper-personalized functions.

Unlike other leading AI agents, such as those from Meta's recently acquired Manus, OpenClaw is also open-sourced, allowing developers to freely inspect and modify its code. 

OpenClaw's open-source nature has likely helped drive adoption by enabling users to build new app integrations. The software itself is free, with users paying only for the costs of running the underlying language model.

So far, the agent has collected over 145,000 GitHub stars and 20,000 forks, a sign of widespread interest, although actual and active usage figures remain unclear.

Media reports suggest that adoption first took off in Silicon Valley, where companies have invested billions in their AI agent ambitions. 

But the agent has since spread to China, where major AI players are also embracing the tool. That includes cloud providers from Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance, which are upgrading their chatbots with full-service shopping and payment tools without leaving the platforms.

OpenClaw can also be paired with Chinese-developed language models, such as DeepSeek, and configured to work with Chinese messaging apps through customized setups.

Early adopters of OpenClaw have expressed a mix of enthusiasm and unease about its abilities.

For example, some AI experts have argued that the agent is overhyped, citing its complex installation, high computational demands, and competition from other available AI agents. 

Many proponents, on the other hand, report saving hours weekly on routine tasks, dubbing it ""AI with hands"" and a major leap forward toward artificial general intelligence — a theoretical AI capable of performing intellectual tasks at or above the human level.

Kaoutar El Maghraoui, an IBM research scientist, said OpenClaw demonstrates that the real-world utility of AI agents is ""not limited to large enterprises"" and can be ""incredibly powerful"" when given full system access. 

Security experts, however, have raised alarms. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, for example, warned that the AI agent presents a ""lethal trifecta"" of risks stemming from its access to private data, exposure to untrusted content and ability to perform external communications while retaining memory. 

Such vulnerabilities could allow attackers to trick the AI agent into executing malicious commands or leaking sensitive data, making it unsuitable for enterprise use, Palo Alto Networks and other security firms, such as Cisco, have warned.

OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger has acknowledged these risks and said that more work is needed on agentic security.""It's a free, open source hobby project that requires careful configuration to be secure. It's not meant for non-technical users. We're working to get it to that point, but currently there are still some rough edges,"" he told CNBC in an email. He added that since the AI agent was launched, he's been building a team around it and with the help of the worldwide security community, they've already made great progress in making it more secure. ""It will take some more time until I recommend it to non-technical users, but I'm confident we'll get there.""

Buzz around OpenClaw has also been fueled by Moltbook, a companion social network for AI agents launched last month by tech entrepreneur Matt Schlicht. 

The platform functions like an online forum, similar to Reddit, where users' OpenClaw agents post written content and interact with other chatbots through comments and upvotes or downvotes.

Posts from agents have appeared to range from reflections on their work for users to wide-ranging manifestos on issues like the end of ""the age of humans."" Some are even launching their own cryptocurrency tokens.

Moltbook has sparked debate on social media, with some viewing the platform as a gimmick and others believing it foreshadows the future of AI autonomy and human-AI relations, for better or worse.

In an X post shared by Elon Musk, former director of AI at Tesla Andrej Karpathy called the activity on Molkbook ""the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing"" he had seen recently.

According to an AI analyst who spoke to CNBC, this conversation and the virality around Moltbook have already influenced the zeitgeist on agentic AI.

""People are able to see the bots communicating and learning in ways indistinguishable from people. That's getting them to start to think more about what they can do in both a positive way and a negative way,"" said Marc Einstein, Counterpoint Research's global head of AI research. 

""These agents appear to be approaching human intelligence, and I think that's why we're seeing this turn into a mic drop moment for the industry... we're getting closer and closer to everyone in the world having their own personal AI assistant,"" he said, adding that OpenClaw is just one of many AI agents emerging.

Gold and silver prices dropped on Monday as increased CME ‍margin requirements added to ‍the selling pressure following last ‍week's selloff sparked by Kevin Warsh's nomination as the incoming Federal Reserve chair.

Spot gold was 3.2% lower at $4,708.19 per ounce, recovering from nearly a ‌10% ‌fall earlier in the session. Bullion shed more than ​9.8% on January 30, in its sharpest one-day drop since 1983.

Gold has lost about $900 since hitting an all-time-high of $5,594.82 on January 29, erasing most of this year's gains.

U.S. gold futures for ⁠April delivery were down 0.3% to $4,730.40/oz.

Spot silver lost 3.4% to $81.65, recovering from a fall of 15% earlier on Monday. It has shed about 33% since notching up an all-time-peak of $121.64 last week.

The CME announced hikes in margins on its precious metal futures on January 30 and said the changes were set to take effect after market close on Monday.

""The increase in margin requirements makes holding speculative positions less appealing now and this will also force a lot on the retail side of the market who do not have the extra liquidity to sell positions,"" said Zain Vawda, analyst at MarketPulse by OANDA.

""It is definitely creating a sort of feedback loop where ‍as prices drop, more traders will face margin calls leading to more selling and ‌even lower prices,"" Vawda added.

The dollar index edged higher ⁠last week after U.S. President Donald Trump named former Federal Reserve Governor Warsh as his Fed chair pick, making dollar-priced bullion more expensive ‍for buyers overseas.

While investors expect Warsh to favour rate cuts, they anticipate he will tighten the Fed's balance sheet, a move typically supportive of the dollar.

Barclays said in a note on Monday it expects rate cuts, fiscal expansion, quantitative easing, fiat debasement and de-dollarization to likely keep investment demand firm ⁠for gold.

Spot platinum fell by 4.3% ‌to $2,070.64 per ounce after hitting a record $2,918.80 on January 26, while palladium shed 2.1% to $1,662.68.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Why the catastrophe bond market is so hot right now","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/catastrophe-bonds-insurance-climate-change-markets.html","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 06:07:27 GMT","



The catastrophe bond market shattered a host of records in 2025 — and many expect another banner year as investors flock to what has been an often-overlooked asset class.

The issuance of so-called CAT bonds ballooned to $25.6 billion in 2025, according to specialist data provider Artemis.bm, eclipsing the 2024 record of just under $17.7 billion by a whopping 45%.

The issuance stemmed from 122 transactions, surpassing the previous record of 95 set in 2023, with 15 first-time sponsors seen entering the market. Taken together, these records reflect a breakout year for what has long been considered a relatively niche corner of the insurance industry.

Andy Palmer, head of insurance-linked securities (ILS) structuring for EMEA and APAC at Swiss Re, one of the world's largest reinsurers, said no one could have predicted the amount of CAT bond issuance in 2025, describing the feat as ""absolutely remarkable."" 

""By any dimension you want to measure it, the market is growing. We are seeing larger deals being done, we are seeing new sponsors coming to market [and] we are seeing a meaningful expansion of risk,"" Palmer told CNBC by video call.

""It was just a shift, I think, mentally for everybody that looks at this space,"" Palmer said. ""We expect that now to continue from here on in.""

First created in the 1990s, CAT bonds refer to a type of financial instrument designed to raise money for insurers in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake. 

These insurance-linked securities are essentially a way for insurers or reinsurers to offload the risk of potentially large losses from extreme events to investors. This in turn, provides insurers with access to funding, helping them to pay claims in the event of a catastrophe. 

Swiss Re's Palmer said roughly 60% of CAT bond market deals tend to be for a three-year term and investors were highly likely to want to renew coverage when those deals expire in 2026.

""So, a very quick rule of thumb might be to have a look at the new issuance back in 2023, which we measure at about $15.6 billion, and that would provide a sort of floor,"" Palmer said. 

An expectation of further growth and larger deals in 2026 means CAT bond issuance could climb to around $20 billion, Palmer said. If realized, this wouldn't be quite as much as 2025, but it would still represent the second-largest year of issuance on record.

In the absence of a disastrous event triggering a loss, CAT bonds are known to offer highly attractive equity-like returns, low volatility and low correlation to broader financial markets. 

The emergence of this asset class as an increasingly mainstream financial instrument comes at a time when the climate crisis is leading to an increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.

In just the last few weeks, for example, a sprawling winter storm has left hundreds of thousands without power in the U.S., severe flooding has wrought havoc across large parts of Mozambique, Eswatini, South Africa and Zimbabwe, and a major heatwave has gripped southeast Australia. 

Steve Evans, owner and editor-in-chief at Artemis.bm, told CNBC that investor interest in the asset class remains ""very high"" after what was the third consecutive year of double-digit returns for many CAT bond fund strategies in 2025.

""This, alongside the increasing uptake of cat bonds as an efficient multi-year source of reinsurance among insurance carriers and others seeking catastrophe risk transfer, should ensure 2026 sees another strong year of issuance in the sector,"" Evans said.

""Over the coming year the market will also see significant levels of maturing deals that will drive cash levels higher and need to be recycled into the new issuance, or be returned to investors,"" he continued. 

""This, along with rising investor awareness of the benefits of cat bonds and ILS as a diversifying asset class, should further ensure that deal execution remains attractive for buyers of cat bond protection, so at Artemis we expect cat bond deal flow to be brisk over the coming months."" 

Indeed, while only $683 million of CAT bond issuance has been tracked so far this year, Evans said there is already more than $2 billion in the pipeline and due to be settled in the coming weeks.

Bob Smith, president and co-chief investment officer at Sage Advisory Services, an Austin-based investment firm, described CAT bonds and insurance-linked securities as a standout choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios over the coming months.

""As a diversifier? Oh my goodness, this is the one thing on that whole spreadsheet that you are looking for,"" Smith told CNBC by video call.

""This is the essence of MPT,"" Smith said, referring to the acronym for modern portfolio theory, an investment strategy designed to balance the risk and return of assets.

""Modern portfolio theory says you really need to diversify your portfolio. Well, this is quintessentially the best thing out there at the moment that you could achieve that,"" Smith said.  

Not everyone was as bullish on the outlook for CAT bonds. Analysts at Fitch Ratings said they expect continued growth in the alternative reinsurance capital market in 2026, citing robust supply from investors, but warned of rising capital pressure.

""Continued momentum in demand will also contribute, including from new sponsors entering the space and the expansion of non-peak perils, including wildfire, cyber and casualty risks,"" analysts at Fitch Ratings said in a research note published Jan. 15. 

""Catastrophe bonds achieved double-digit returns in 2025, with manageable losses from the California wildfires and the generally higher positioning of catastrophe bonds in cedent catastrophe reinsurance towers."" 

Like Swiss Re's Palmer, analysts at Fitch Ratings said they anticipate CAT bond investors to reinvest their bumper returns back into the ILS market this year, which in turn will boost capital and pressure returns. 

""However, Fitch expects investor returns in 2026 to remain attractive relative to other asset classes,"" they added.

Bitmine staked ETH stands at 2,873,459 and MAVAN staking solution on track to launch Q1 2026

Bitmine now owns 3.55% of the ETH token supply, over 70% of the way to the 'Alchemy of 5%' in just 6 months

Bitmine recently closed on initial $200 million investment into Beast Industries

Bitmine Crypto + Total Cash Holdings + ""Moonshots"" total $10.7 billion, including 4.285 million ETH tokens, total cash of $586 million, and other crypto holdings

Bitmine leads crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of BMNR stock

Bitmine is the 105th most traded stock in the US, trading $1.1 billion per day (5-day avg)

Bitmine remains supported by a premier group of institutional investors including ARK's Cathie Wood, MOZAYYX, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, Galaxy Digital and personal investor Thomas ""Tom"" Lee to support Bitmine's goal of acquiring 5% of ETH

LAS VEGAS, Feb. 2, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (""Bitmine"" or the ""Company"") a Bitcoin and Ethereum Network company with a focus on the accumulation of crypto for long term investment, today announced Bitmine crypto + total cash + ""moonshots"" holdings totaling $10.7 billion.

As of February 1st, 2026 at 6:00pm ET, the Company's crypto holdings are comprised of 4,285,125 ETH at $2,317 per ETH (Coinbase), 193 Bitcoin (BTC), $200 million stake in Beast Industries, $20 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) (""moonshots"") and total cash of $586 million. Bitmine's ETH holdings are 3.55% of the ETH supply (of 120.7 million ETH).

""ETH prices have dropped sharply in the past month from ~$3,000 to ~$2,300. This occurred while Ethereum daily transactions hit an all-time high (ATH) of 2.5mm (per theblock.co) and active addresses soared in 2026 to an ATH to 1 million daily (per theblock.co). In other words, Ethereum on-chain activity and fundamentals have grown solidly in the past few months, but ETH prices have declined. During the crypto winter of 2021-2022 or 2018-2019, Ethereum transaction activity and active wallets declined, which is counter to what we have seen in the past 12 months,"" said Thomas ""Tom"" Lee, Executive Chairman of Bitmine.

""Thus, non-fundamental factors are arguably more the factors explaining the weakness in ETH prices. Foremost, in our view, is that leverage has not returned yet to crypto as the October 10th ripple effects continue. The second factor is the surge in precious metals prices, which have acted as a 'vortex' sucking away risk appetite from crypto. That said, Gold seems to be following 1979-1980 closely. What confirmed the top in January 1980 was a -13% daily decline on January 22, 1980. On January 30, 2026, Gold fell -9%, its 4th largest ever daily decline. Each of the prior 3 larger declines marked a near-term top,"" said Lee.

""In the past week, we acquired 41,788 ETH,"" continued Lee. ""Bitmine has been steadily buying Ethereum, as we view this pullback as attractive, given the strengthening fundamentals. In our view, the price of ETH is not reflective of the high utility of ETH and its role as the future of finance.""

As of February 1, 2026, Bitmine total staked ETH stands at 2,897,459 ($6.7 billion at $2,317 per ETH). This is an increase of 888,192 in the past week. ""Bitmine has staked more ETH than other entities in the world. At scale (when Bitmine's ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking rewards is $374 million annually (using 2.81% CESR), or greater than $1 million per day,"" stated Lee.

""Annualized staking revenues are now $188 million, up +18% in the past week (see chart). And this 2.9 million ETH is about 67% of the 4.3 million ETH held by Bitmine. The CESR (Composite Ethereum Staking Rate, administered by Quatrefoil) is 2.81%. We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America VAlidator Network (MAVAN). This will be the 'best-in-class' solution offering secure staking infrastructure and will be deployed in early calendar 2026. Bitmine is currently working with 3 staking providers as the Company moves towards unveiling MAVAN in 2026,"" continued Lee.

Bitmine crypto holding reigns as the #1 Ethereum treasury and #2 global treasury, behind Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR), which owns 712,647 BTC valued at $55 billion. Bitmine remains the largest ETH treasury in the world. 

Bitmine is one of the most widely traded stocks in the US. According to data from Fundstrat, the stock has traded average daily dollar volume of $1.1 billion (5-day average, as of January 30, 2026), ranking #105 in the US, behind Schlumberger NV (rank #104) and ahead of Humana (rank #106) among 5,704 US-listed stocks (statista.com and Fundstrat research).

The GENIUS Act and Securities and Exchange Commission's (""the SEC"") Project Crypto are as transformational to financial services in 2025 as US action on August 15, 1971 ending Bretton Woods and the USD on the gold standard 54 years ago. This 1971 event was the catalyst for the modernization of Wall Street, creating the iconic Wall Street titans and financial and payment rails of today. These proved to be better investments than gold.

                            Why is Tom Lee under fire?                        

Bitmine's Tom Lee is facing mounting criticism after Ethereum's price fell below $2,200 this week, sharply underperforming his high-profile forecast that it could reach between $7,000 and $9,000 by the end of January.

Now into February, Ethereum has lost more  than 52% from its recent highs, while Bitcoin has retreated to below $77,824, far short of Lee's call for $180,000.

The shortfall has triggered intense backlash on social media, where investors questioned Lee's credibility and accused him of fueling unrealistic expectations in an already volatile market.

Lee's aggressive forecasts have made him a target on X, where critics grouped him into what one trader called the “prediction industrial complex.”

“Called for $180,000 BTC and $7,000–$9,000 ETH by end of January,” the post read.

“Reality with 48 hours left? That's not a miss. That's a hallucination.”

Another user wrote: “Dude has no cred anymore. Stop putting him in front of consumers,” while a separate comment said Lee's “biggest mistake was getting into the short-term prediction game,” adding that it “makes him look bad.”

“I unfollowed after this time,” said another.

Tom Lee called for $7K–$9K by Jan 2026…and $180K Bitcoin by the end of this month.

Now there are only 2 days left.

After this, I don't want to hear another “expert prediction” from these paid voices.

Retail believed them.They exited with the bags.

🎯 Lesson: Stop trusting… pic.twitter.com/QUXFh61xBo 

— Mr. Crypto Whale 🐋 (@Mrcryptoxwhale) January 30, 2026 



Lee, who chairs BitMine Immersion Technologies, has frequently defended his long-term outlook.

“We think that ETH can be $7,000 to $9,000 by the end of January,” Lee said earlier this month, adding that under a scenario where Bitcoin reaches $250,000 and Ethereum trades at its historical average ratio, “that's $12,000 Ethereum.”

While Lee's supporters note that some of his long-term directional calls — particularly on Bitcoin — were eventually validated when the cryptocurrency reached record highs in October 2025, critics say his forecasts have consistently missed.

Appearing on CNBC's Squawk Box  on Monday, Tom Lee acknowledged the recent sell-off but said prices were diverging from underlying network activity.

“I think as long as crypto fundamentals are good, then crypto prices should follow,” Lee said.

In a subsequent post on X , Lee said crypto prices had “fallen sharply in 2026 and languished after Oct. 10,” despite what he described as strong fundamentals, including rising daily transaction volumes.

He contrasted the current downturn with past crypto winters, arguing that network usage remains robust even as prices lag.

Crypto prices have fallen sharply in 2026 and languished after Oct 10th. 

– fundamentals have been good as daily transactions are surging – but prices lagging, – a contrast to past crypto “winters” 🥶🌨️

— Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) February 2, 2026 



Lee also emphasized BitMine's balance sheet strength, saying the company had no debt and held about $586 million in cash and roughly 4.3 million Ether, which he said generated daily interest and staking rewards.

That position, he argued, allows the firm to withstand prolonged weakness in Ethereum's price.

Tom Lee's forecasts have also drawn criticism from long-time Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff, who has previously labeled Lee a “CNBC shill.”

After Lee argued  that rising gold prices were bullish for Bitcoin, Schiff pushed back, saying the two assets historically competed rather than moved in tandem.

CNBC's favorite Bitcoin shill @fundstrat  claims a rising gold price is bullish for Bitcoin. But Bitcoin thrived when gold traded sideways, allowing it to steal gold's thunder as the “better” inflation hedge and safe haven. Gold's recent breakout destroys that false narrative.

— Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 5, 2026 



“CNBC's favorite Bitcoin shill claims a rising gold price is bullish for Bitcoin,” Schiff wrote on X in December.

“But Bitcoin thrived when gold traded sideways, allowing it to steal gold's thunder as the ‘better' inflation hedge and safe haven. Gold's recent breakout destroys that false narrative.”

Schiff has regularly aimed his criticism at media outlets and commentators he claims have failed to challenge bullish narratives around crypto.

He alleged that CNBC interviewers routinely avoid tough questions and overlook the accuracy of previous predictions.

“CNBC will continue to host Bitcoin shills for softball interviews where they refuse to hold their guests accountable for their horribly wrong Bitcoin forecasts,” he wrote on X.

“…or ask them to explain why gold and silver are soaring as Bitcoin, which they touted as digital gold, keeps tanking.”

Liquid Capital founder Jack Yi said on Sunday that his firm's earlier bullish stance on Ethereum (ETH) was premature, acknowledging he failed to move higher despite expectations that it was undervalued relative to Bitcoin (BTC).

In an X post on Monday, Jack Yi said that being bullish on Ethereum too early was a mistake after Liquid Capital cleared positions near market highs. 

Yi said Bitcoin was trading around $100,000 at the time, while Ethereum remained consistently near $ 3,000, leading him to view Ethereum as undervalued. However, he said that he anticipated upside that failed to materialize, and profits from the previous cycle have since been fully retraced.

He said that the firm is prioritizing risk control while waiting for a clearer market direction. He also acknowledged the pressure of public scrutiny, describing himself as “the person under the most pressure online right now,” and noted that remaining disciplined is difficult in an industry where it is “always tempting to be bullish.”  

Yi has repeatedly described himself as an Ethereum bull, though he has not publicly disclosed the firm's exact Ethereum holdings. Instead, he outlined plans to deploy significant capital toward further accumulation.

Ethereum (ETH) was trading at around $2,250, down 6.7% in the last 24 hours, and saw about $219.98 million in total liquidations. On Stocktwits, the retail sentiment around ETH remained in ‘bearish' territory, with chatter going from ‘high' to ‘extremely high' levels over the past day.

Yi's comments marked a shift from his earlier position on Ethereum. He had previously stated that Ethereum was undervalued at around $3,000 and warned against shorting it, arguing that Ethereum would eventually catch up to Bitcoin.  However, while the two assets have historically moved together, recent market cycles have been driven by Bitcoin, leaving Ethereum trailing and highlighting the timing risk Yi later acknowledged.

According to reports, Bitcoin's strong 2024 performance, supported by institutional demand and spot ETF inflows, widened the gap and forced traders to reassess Ethereum exposure despite ongoing long-term optimism.

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at around $76,794, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours, and saw about $266.67 million in total liquidations. On Stocktwits, the retail sentiment around BTC went from ‘bearish' to ‘extremely bearish' territory, with chatter at ‘extremely high' levels over the past day.

The crypto market crash continued on Monday, with Bitcoin and most altcoins being in the red. Bitcoin price dropped to $75,000 while the market capitalization of all coins dropped by 4.4% in the last 24 hours to $2.55 trillion.

Most altcoins were in the red, with the top laggards being tokens like River, Monero, Ethereum, Nexo, Chainlink, and Kaspa. Ethereum dropped by 10% in the last 24 hours, moving to a low of $2,200.

Crypto market crashed as Fear and Greed Index fell 

The ongoing crypto market crash happened as the Fear and Greed Index moved to the extreme fear zone of 15, the lowest level in over a month.

The rising fear is happening as many investors capitulate and start selling as the industry continues to underperform the market. For example, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs shed assets in January, continuing a trend that has been going on for months.

Data shows that the 24-hour liquidations stood at over $735 million, while the open interest dropped by 5% to over $108 billion. Falling open interest is a sign that investors are not using as much leverage as they did in the past.

At the same time, the elevated liquidations are happening as exchanges shut leveraged trades after hitting their margin levels. Ethereum positions worth over $272 million were shut, while Bitcoin positions worth $249 million were closed. 

Kevin Warsh and Iran tensions

There are two broad reasons why the crypto crash is happening this year. For example, Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh to become the next Federal Reserve Chair. 

Historically, Warsh has always been a hawk who has opposed quantitative easing and criticized the Fed for cutting interest rates too early. Therefore, while Trump promised a Fed Chair who would cut interest rates to 1, chances are that Warsh will not do that. 

Risk of a war in the Middle East

The other key reason behind the ongoing crypto market crash is the ongoing fears of a war in the Middle East. Iranian leaders warned that there will be a regional war if the United States attacked, which explains why Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) have retreated.

Donald Trump, on the other hand, has continued to accumulate an armada in the region. He is also under pressure from hawks like Lindsey Graham, Mike Pompeo, and Mark Levin, whom he watches all the time on Fox News.

These neocons have convinced Trump that the only way to deal with Iran is to topple the regime. Therefore, the crypto market crash happened because Bitcoin and other altcoins are not safe havens. 

Bitcoin price technicals points to more downside



The weekly timeline chart shows that the Bitcoin price is signaling more downside in the near term. It has moved below the key support at $80,488, the lower side of the bearish flag pattern. 

Bitcoin has also slumped below the strong, pivot, and reverse level of the Murrey Math Lines tool. It remains below the 50-week moving average and the lower side of the rising wedge tool.

Therefore, the most likely scenario is where Bitcoin continues falling, potentially to the ultimate support level at $50,000. Such a move will point to more downside in the crypto market.

Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc. has agreed to acquire blockchain-based investing platform Tokens.com, which will serve as the foundation for a “unified investment and personal finance platform” that the company hopes to build for homeowners.

It's all part of newly appointed CEO Marcus Lemonis' vision to build an integrated home ecosystem that — in addition to supplying homeowners with the products they need through its retail banners, Bed Bath & Beyond, Overstock and BuyBuy Baby — also helps homeowners finance, protect and care for their home.

Lemonis laid out this vision when he took the helm of the company in early January, but work toward this goal has been underway since Lemonis first joined the company as Executive Chairman of the Board in February 2024.

“People understand the ‘Bed,' they understand the ‘Bath,' but even in pop culture, yes, even in movies and television, few could explain the ‘Beyond' part of our name,” said Lemonis in a statement announcing his appointment as CEO. “‘Beyond' means something far more than retail. It stands for our commitment to support the family, the four corners of their property and the four walls of their home. I want to make owning, living in and caring for a home easier, less expensive and more rewarding for all.”

Bed Bath & Beyond already has been actively building out a blockchain asset portfolio, beginning with the April 2025 offering of digital tokens that allowed investors to own a piece of the IP and performance of the Overstock and BuyBuy Baby brands.

Upon launching its new franchising model for Bed Bath & Beyond stores, BB&B Inc. also announced that franchisees would have access to digital tokenization capabilities to democratize ownership of their stores and raise capitalthrough the tZero platform, in which BB&B is an investor through its Medici portfolio.

TZero also will play a key role in the Tokens.com platform, which Bed Bath & Beyond expects to be operational by July 1, 2026.

The platform will aim to address what Bed Bath & Beyond described as a “fragmented market for financial services” by delivering a one-stop journey for real estate and other real-world asset finance that bridges both tokenized and traditional investing.

The idea is to give customers a clear, consolidated view of their assets and interests — including ownership structure, estimated value ranges, existing obligations and available liquidity options — so that homeowners can easily understand what they own as well as the regulated pathways available to them to access or deploy that value.

“Providing responsible, compliant liquidity pathways for homeowners and real-world asset holders is our strategy and long-term vision,” said Lemonis in a statement.

To do this, Tokens.com will offer issuer-led tokenization of qualifying public and private securities and tokenized real-world assets, alongside asset-backed financing solutions including home purchases, refinancing and home equity solutions. The platform also will allow access to a range of cryptocurrencies as a funding vector and investable asset and, over time, other tokenized and traditional assets. Tokens.com will be fully owned by Bed Bath & Beyond and as such will be integrated with the company's other financial technology, insurance and blockchain-based businesses.

The platform will use the regulatory and operational infrastructure and platform services provided by tZero to support tokenization, custody and trading capabilities on the platform. Tokens.com also will integrate with a series of financial partners, including Figure Technologies and Figure Markets, to access mortgages, home equity lines of credit, renovation loans, home makeover loans and other asset-backed lending and capital solutions.

“With Figure's market-leading tokenization technology and platform, Tokens.com can help unlock the trillions of U.S. home equity and crypto assets, bringing consumers liquidity and spending power,” said Michael Tannenbaum, CEO of Figure Technology Solutions in a statement.  

The overarching idea is that tokenization can be “financial plumbing” that brings homeowners' varied assets, like property, into single unified ecosystem. “Placing an asset or security on blockchain technology does not change its legal or economic nature,” explained BB&B in its acquisition announcement. “Securities remain securities, ownership rights remain intact and existing regulatory frameworks continue to apply. Tokenization is treated as infrastructure, not a new asset class.”

For customers who access liquidity through the platform, Tokens.com is expected to provide flexibility in how funds can be delivered and how investing and other financing needs can be addressed through a true multi-asset ecosystem that will utilize both cash and cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins such as YLDS, the yield-bearing stablecoin offered by Figure.

Tokens.com also will be designed with an embedded AI layer developed by ShyftLabs that will support asset analysis, eligibility assessment and certain decision orchestration actions across the platform, in order to “support informed decision-making while keeping all execution, approvals and transactions within regulated frameworks and partner systems.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","A crypto social media network's failure raises an awkward question: Is blockchain good for anything beside finance?","https://fortune.com/crypto/2026/02/02/tether-radical-vision-newsletter-paolo-ardoino/","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 13:05:00 GMT","

Is it too soon to say crypto winter? Perhaps. But it certainly is getting ugly out there: Asset prices are in freefall, key legislation hangs by a thread, and members of Crypto Twitter fret it's their turn to learn what it's like to “have fun staying poor.” One company, though, is sitting pretty amid all this. That would be Tether, which last week reported $10 billion in profits for 2025, and has amassed so much gold it's now storing bars of the stuff in Swiss bunkers from World War II.

I recently sat down with Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino, whose view of crypto and the future is the subject of my latest Fortune magazine feature. The vision Ardoino shared is a dark one: He thinks Europe—and possibly the West more broadly—is on the cusp of a cultural and economic death spiral, and that new forms of decentralized technology offer the best hope for surviving this coming collapse.

This technology includes new currency networks, including the USDT stablecoin, which has become so popular in parts of Africa that “Tether” has become a verb. During our chat, however, Ardoino made clear he views Tether as much bigger than crypto. He sees a world where people communicate over P2P servers that lie beyond the reach of giant telecom companies. Tether, he thinks, can help provide this service as well as decentralized options for things like cloud computing and even farming.

This may sound pie-in-the-sky, but Tether is a company to take seriously. The company is sitting on a gusher of revenue thanks to the interest it earns on USDT's reserves. And unlike here in the U.S., where Coinbase and banks are in a lobbying slugfest over how to share that revenue with consumers, Ardoino says Tether's overseas customers are not particularly concerned about yield. That means it will continue to have billions to invest in its decentralized dreams—and, indeed, it has already laid out billions to invest in P2P versions of social media, AI, satellites, and more.

The question is whether any of this can work. I'm intrigued by the idea of new forms of global, permissionless technologies gaining traction. And I fear that Ardoino may be right in predicting that demand for these P2P services—including crypto—will accelerate as governments grow more dysfunctional.

But I'm also skeptical about Tether's proposals to rewire entire societies around decentralized services. This may be possible in small, homogeneous populations like those of El Salvador or Suriname—countries that Ardoino regards as model societies—but it doesn't sound very realistic for places like the U.S. or China.

Time will tell where Ardoino's view of decentralization will catch on but, for now, it's enough to say Tether, despite its controversies, is a company to watch closely. And speaking of big names in crypto, I'm pleased to announce that Fortune this spring will be dropping the inaugural Crypto 100 list—a first of its kind ranking of leading firms in ten categories in the tradition of the Fortune 500. More details soon.

Gartner forecasts that by 2026, around 40% of enterprise applications will incorporate AI agents – a steep rise from under 5% in 2023 – illustrating how quickly agentic AI is becoming embedded in enterprise software. Last month, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) published its “Tech Futures: Agentic AI” report, which explores the emerging landscape of agentic artificial intelligence (AI), highlighting both the opportunities and the data protection challenges that organisations should consider as they develop or deploy these technologies. 

Below, we summarise the key takeaways from the ICO's report, with added commentary on practical implications for organisations considering or already using agentic AI systems.

What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to systems that can autonomously pursue goals, adapt to new situations, and exhibit reasoning-like capacities. These systems combine generative AI (such as large language models like GPT, Gemini or Claude) with tools that enable contextual understanding and automation of open-ended tasks.

Unlike traditional agents, these systems leverage large language models to iterate and reason, enabling them to complete a wide range of tasks with minimal human intervention. This autonomy introduces both efficiency gains and governance risk that organisations must manage proactively.

Key Takeaways

ICO's Position and Regulatory Direction

The ICO recognises the rapid development and adoption of agentic AI across various use cases and sectors including commerce, government services and medicine and notes that the novel nature of agentic AI, combined with its fast rollout, makes it difficult to predict future capabilities and calls for flexible governance frameworks.

While the ICO's report does not constitute formal guidance, it provides a clear indication of the regulator's early thinking and priority areas. It highlights accountability, transparency, and governance as likely focal points for compliance, and outlines several data protection risks associated with the deployment of agentic AI, as well as some data protection opportunities it may present. For organisations, this is a strong signal to start aligning internal policies and risk assessments now, rather than waiting for prescriptive rules.

The ICO is also actively engaging with industry stakeholders and international regulators to shape the next phase of guidance and codes of practice. Businesses should monitor these discussions closely and consider participating in consultations to influence outcomes and ensure they remain ahead of evolving regulatory requirements.

Data Protection Risks and Organisational Responsibilities

The ICO emphasises that agentic AI systems, regardless of their autonomy, do not have legal personality. Accordingly, organisations remain responsible for compliance under GDPR and related laws. This means that even where AI agents act independently, the organisation deploying them must ensure that governance, oversight and accountability mechanisms are in place.

Key risks identified include: 

Determining controller/processor roles in complex supply chains

Agentic AI often relies on multiple integrated tools and APIs, creating layered processing chains. Therefore, organisations should consider and clearly define who acts as controller and who acts as processor at each stage, as failure to do so could lead to gaps in accountability and enforcement risk. 

Automated decision-making with limited human oversight

Agents capable of iterative reasoning may make decisions that affect individuals with minimal or no human intervention. This raises compliance issues under Article 22 UK GDPR and fairness principles. Organisations should ensure meaningful human oversight for such decisions, documenting this oversight in relevant DPIAs.

Broad or unclear purposes for data processing

AI agents are versatile and therefore carry a heightened risk of processing data for broader purposes than intended once they are deployed. If the purposes of agents' use are not clearly set out, organisations run the risk of breaching transparency, purpose limitation and data minimisation obligations. 

Increased complexity in transparency and individual rights

The rapidly changing nature of agentic AI makes it challenging for organisations who deploy AI agents to meet data transparency and explainability obligations. The ICO notes that there are already cases of AI agents acting in ways that an organisation did not foresee when they were deployed, making it difficult for those organisations to fully understand how and where relevant information is processed.

Practical Steps for Compliance

Organisations should: 

Define clear purposes and task boundaries

Organisations should set specific, limited purposes for each agentic AI deployment to avoid agents overstepping their intended purpose and ensure these are clearly communicated to users.

Implement data minimisation controls

If possible, data accessible to AI agents should be restricted to what is necessary for their tasks. This may include configuring tool access to avoid unintended data collection.

Ensure transparency and explainability of agentic AI actions

Clear and up-to-date information should be provided on what your organisation's AI agents do, the data they access and how data subjects can exercise their rights. In this regard, agent activity logs may be helpful. Organisations should ensure that agents' actions can be continuously monitored and stopped if issues arise. 

Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk agentic AI deployments

It is very likely that the deployment of AI agents will result in a high risk to people's information. Therefore, organisations should carry out DPIAs for AI agent use. DPIAs should consider the risks, controls and impacts of using agentic AI before agents are deployed and should be updated regularly.

Prepare for evolving roles of Data Protection Officers (DPOs) 

The ICO notes that agentic AI increases the complexity of oversight, documentation and rights management, which may reshape the responsibilities and skill‑set expected of DPOs. Organisations should ensure their DPOs are adequately supported to understand agentic AI workflows to mitigate risk arising from the use of agents. Additionally, the ICO notes organisations may consider exploring how AI‑enabled “DPO agents” could assist with tasks such as monitoring, logging and rights‑request handling while ensuring that ultimate accountability remains with the human DPO.

Identified Innovation Opportunities

The ICO is clear that it encourages privacy-by-design innovation with respect to agentic AI, including: 

Future Scenarios

The ICO outlines four possible future scenarios with respect to agentic AI development, ranging from limited adoption to widespread, high-capability agentic AI. Each scenario carries different regulatory and governance implications: lower‑capability agents may pose fewer risks but offer limited benefits, while high‑capability, widely‑deployed agents demand far more sophisticated oversight, auditability and role‑allocation controls. The ICO's use of scenario planning highlights that organisations should prepare governance frameworks that can evolve as agentic AI systems become more capable and more deeply embedded across operations.

Conclusion

The ICO's report signals a proactive regulatory approach to the growing sphere of agentic AI, emphasising the need for organisations to balance innovation with robust data protection measures. Organisations developing or deploying agentic AI should review their governance frameworks, ensure compliance with UK GDPR principles and stay engaged with evolving ICO guidance to ensure that they are best placed to deploy agentic AI responsibly and efficiently.

The right ICO development is critical for maintaining the security of raised funds, regulations, and token distribution. A proper ICO does not expose developers to technical risks, fraud while providing security in the crypto space. Partnering with an ICO Development Company gives businesses security, regulation, and a scalable platform to attract serious investors. Security prevents cyber threats, develops relationships with investors, promotes participation, and attracts investors from national and international markets. These benefits lead to long-term growth.

As the ICO landscape matures, security becomes a basic requirement for project success. Creating a strong security infrastructure from the beginning is a priority due to increasing cyberattacks, regulations, and informed investors. Security around ICO development is essential to ensure that token transactions, investor data, and smart contracts are secure, and to prevent reputational damage. Experienced ICO Development Companies implement several layers of security at all stages of the development process, ensuring that a stable infrastructure is in place and that there is constant monitoring. This leads to successful fundraising and investor confidence.

Trust is built over time by transparency, reliability and security. In the world of cryptocurrency, where scams and technical problems have proved fatal for many projects, security remains an important factor of legitimacy for the digital currency. An experienced ICO Development Company proves that it is reliable by verifying smart contracts and safeguarding funds and being ready for legal compliance on time, which persuades investors to fund an ICO. Trust increases both participation rates and time commitment.

Security not only protects assets but also plays a crucial role in expanding investor participation. A well-protected ICO platform attracts global investors who prioritize safety and reliability. When users experience smooth onboarding, secure transactions, and transparent systems, they are more likely to recommend the project to others. An ICO Development Company that emphasizes security-driven user experience helps businesses reach broader audiences while maintaining trust standards.

Smart contracts ease fundraising, token issuance, and disbursements to investors. Their vulnerabilities can lead to investor losses and financial failure of the tokens' associated projects. Professional ICO Development Company applies the best practices in the industry, executes thorough testing and obtains professionals to review the code to prevent internal and external attacks as the blockchain automation process becomes more complex.

Security and compliance are also closely linked for keeping ICO projects sustainable. Technical security solutions protect the project from cyber threats, while compliance helps in surviving in the long run. Investors prefer projects that show such well-developed infrastructures. An experienced ICO Development Company, with compliance tools like identity verification, secure data storage, and transaction transparency, keeps your project aligned with global standards.

Lastly, professionalism is an important factor in ICO. A secure platform developed by professionals not only shows technical expertise but also a mature business. An experienced ICO Development Company will lower the risk through proven methodologies, ensure scalability and ensure overall transparency. These traits and reputation will encourage larger investments and longer business relationships.

Security is important beyond the ICO itself: well-secured projects are less likely to have issues and can better function in the long term, and tokens are held by people on trusted platforms. The ICO Development Company prioritizes monitoring and updating assets as the ecosystem progresses, ensuring asset safety.

Trustworthy and credible ICO development requires effective communication with investors. Security involves project communication and strategies, and applies to aspects ranging from smart contracts and compliance and transparency of raising and managing funds, to continuing project security and maintenance over time. An ICO Development Company offers protection, scalability, and regulatory compliance to your network. When investors feel confident that the platform is safe and transparent, they are more likely to participate, allowing the project to reach its funding goals sooner, and providing tokens with sustainable value.

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is considering the issuance of a wholesale CBDC (wCBDC) to support the settlement of tokenized government bonds. The country's Bureau of the Treasury first issued tokenized treasury bonds to institutions in 2023, followed by a retail issuance in 2024. Separately, in 2024 the central bank ran wCBDC trials, Project Agila,  to explore the usage of the CBDC for interbank settlement outside of working hours. 

“What we are thinking of doing next is to focus on wholesale CBDC settling government bonds, because the Bureau of the Treasury moved ahead with their pilot of the tokenized treasury bonds. It just lacked a settlement instrument, so we will be providing that with CBDC,” said BSP Deputy Governor Mamerto Tangonan, according to local media outlet GMA News.

Building on the initial Project Agila trials which involved six banks, that is expected to expand for the second trial, with no target date specified. BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr. previously said he intended to launch a wCBDC significantly before his term expires in 2029, but the central bank has no plans for a retail CBDC.

India's e-rupee is no longer just a tech experiment; it has become an important part of the country's financial plans. With emerging proposals to take it beyond India's borders, the e-rupee is now positioned as a critical tool for streamlining international trade, remittances and tourism. It is also increasingly discussed in the context of India's geopolitical strategy.

This article explores what the e-rupee is and how India plans to use it to address cross-border challenges. It examines the strategic objectives behind the move, how such transactions could function and what a successful implementation may entail.

What is the e-rupee?

The e-rupee is India's central bank digital currency (CBDC), a digital form of the Indian rupee issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on par with physical cash. It functions like digital cash stored in a wallet, with the RBI acting as the guarantor of its value. The RBI is currently running pilot programs for both retail (public use) and wholesale (institutional use) versions to test the technology, distribution and practical applications.

Unlike India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which facilitates real-time transfers between bank accounts, the e-rupee represents sovereign digital money itself. This allows for direct, instantaneous and final settlement without relying on multiple intermediaries.

Did you know? The idea of cross-border CBDCs gained momentum after central banks realized that even instant domestic payments can take days to settle internationally because of legacy correspondent banking layers.

The cross-border challenges India aims to address

Current international payments depend heavily on correspondent banking networks and systems tied to the US dollar. These often involve delays, high costs, limited transparency and dependence on intermediary banks. Such inefficiencies affect businesses, remittance senders and travelers.

India views the e-rupee as a potential solution by enabling a digital, interoperable infrastructure for cross-border settlements.

Recent policy discussions have increasingly focused on international applications beyond domestic use. The RBI has proposed linking the e-rupee with other countries' CBDCs, particularly those of BRICS nations, to streamline cross-border trade and tourism transactions.

Four strategic motivations behind India's global e-rupee push

A blend of economic, financial and strategic priorities drives India's interest in taking the e-rupee beyond domestic borders. These objectives reflect how New Delhi aims to modernize cross-border payments while strengthening the rupee's role in global transactions.

Reducing costs and improving speed for remittances and payments: India is one of the world's top recipients of remittances, and many Indians travel or work abroad. Traditional cross-border transfers involve multiple banks and foreign exchange conversions, increasing both time and cost. A direct e-rupee corridor or interoperability with other CBDCs could reduce intermediaries, enabling faster and lower-cost transfers that benefit migrant workers, families and small businesses.

Simplifying trade and tourism settlements: Proposals to connect CBDCs among BRICS countries aim to ease payments for trade and tourism by allowing direct settlement in sovereign digital currencies. This would reduce the need for dollar-based conversions or complex intermediary processes, which is especially relevant given growing trade volumes within BRICS.

Promoting the internationalization of the rupee: India has long sought to expand the rupee's use in global trade settlements and financial flows without framing the effort as de-dollarization. Linking the e-rupee with other CBDCs could enhance its efficiency and international appeal, particularly in Asia and among BRICS partners.

Providing a regulated alternative to private stablecoins: While US dollar-pegged stablecoins and other private digital assets are seeing wider global adoption, the RBI has warned that they carry monetary and systemic risks due to limited oversight and lack of sovereign backing. A CBDC-based cross-border system offers a regulated alternative that reduces the risk of financial fragmentation.

Did you know? In early global CBDC pilots, banks reported that real-time cross-border settlement reduced the need for large pre-funded nostro accounts, freeing up idle capital for lending or liquidity management.

How cross-border e-rupee transactions could work

Experts and policymakers have outlined several practical approaches to enable seamless cross-border use of the e-rupee:

Bilateral CBDC corridors: Central banks from two countries establish direct agreements for e-rupee settlement, including foreign exchange conversion mechanisms and aligned regulatory standards.

Multilateral platforms: A shared technical infrastructure connects CBDCs from multiple countries, modeled on initiatives such as the multi-CBDC Bridge, to promote broader interoperability.

Linking domestic payment systems with CBDC settlement: India has seen success in connecting UPI with select foreign payment networks. This approach integrates interoperable payment rails, with the e-rupee serving as the underlying settlement asset.

Barriers to global CBDC interoperability

Cross-border CBDC integration remains complex. Countries must harmonize technology standards, governance frameworks, compliance requirements, including Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) rules, and mechanisms for dispute resolution. A persistent challenge is managing settlement imbalances, where one country accumulates excess holdings of another's digital currency without corresponding outflows.

Geopolitical factors also play a role, as such initiatives could prompt responses from dominant currency issuers or key trade partners. Navigating these efforts requires careful consideration of broader strategic dynamics.

Did you know? Several countries exploring CBDC linkages see tourism as a surprisingly strong use case, as visitors could pay digitally in sovereign money without opening local bank accounts or converting cash.

Key outcomes and milestones for the global e-rupee

For India, taking the e-rupee beyond its borders would mean delivering measurable outcomes. These include lower transaction costs and faster settlement times for cross-border payments, wider international use of the rupee in trade and tourism, and successful operational pilots that enable banks and fintech firms to conduct borderless transactions using the e-rupee.

Key milestones could include launching pilot corridors with strategic partners, strengthening regulatory frameworks and securing broader participation from financial institutions.

Positioning India in the future of money

India's efforts to extend the e-rupee internationally reflect a broader strategic vision. The policy aims to modernize cross-border payments, safeguard financial system resilience and expand the rupee's global footprint within a digital, regulated environment.

Whether achieved through bilateral linkages, multilateral platforms or enhanced interoperable systems, the e-rupee could alter how international money flows are structured over time. Realizing this potential, however, will require policymakers to address the underlying technical, regulatory and geopolitical complexities effectively.

The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is exploring the use of a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) to settle government securities.

The central bank is currently developing a strategic roadmap and a second proof of concept to support this initiative.

BSP Deputy Governor Mamerto Tangonan confirmed that the next phase will align with the Bureau of the Treasury's recent advancements.

“What we are thinking of doing next is to focus on wholesale CBDC settling government bonds, because the Bureau of the Treasury moved ahead with their pilot of the tokenised treasury bonds,” Tangonan said.

He noted that the treasury's pilot “lacked a settlement instrument, so we will be providing that with CBDC”.

This development follows the conclusion of Project Agila in 2024, the BSP's initial pilot testing for wholesale CBDC.

The project involved various financial institutions and covered functional, performance, and security testing to evaluate technology solutions for large-value payments.

BSP Governor Eli Remolona Jr. stated that wholesale CBDCs will “enhance liquidity management, reduce settlement risks, and support financial stability.”

The central bank will use the insights from Project Agila to guide its broader technology roadmap and improve the national payment system.

While the BSP sees clear potential in wholesale applications, such as cross-border trade finance and securities settlement, plans for a retail version remain on hold.

Tangonan explained that they have not yet seen a “convincing benefit for retail” compared to the advantages identified in the wholesale sector.

He added that a retail CBDC would only be considered if significant gaps appeared in the current digital payment system.

DUMAGUETE CITY — The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) on Monday said it is looking at using the planned wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) to settle government bonds, with a second proof of concept currently in the works.

According to BSP deputy governor Mamerto Tangonan, the central bank is still working to establish a strategic roadmap on the CBDC exploring pertinent use cases, following Project Agila or the first proof of concept.

“What we are thinking of doing next is to focus on wholesale CBDC settling government bonds, kasi (because) the Bureau of the Treasury moved ahead with their pilot of the tokenized treasury bonds. It just lacked a settlement instrument, so we will be providing that with CBDC,” he said.

To recall, the central bank completed testing for Project Agila in 2024, covering functional, performance, security, exploratory, and end-to-end programmability testing.

The BTr launched its maiden offering of Philippine peso-denominated tokenized treasury bonds (TTBs) to raise P10 billion from the domestic bond market. They were issued in the form of digital tokens, maintained in the BTr's distributed ledger technology (DLT) registry.

CBDCs are digital money denominated in the national unit of account and are direct liabilities of the central bank, in this case the Philippine peso and the BSP.

The central bank is primarily looking at the wholesale use of CBDCs which may be utilized by commercial banks and other financial institutions for interbank payments, securities, transactions, and cross-border payments.

Tangonan declined to give a timeline on the second proof of concept, as he said the scope will first have to be determined.

For the second round of proof of concept, Tangonan said the BSP is looking to widen its scope and work with more participating banks from just six previously.

“We need to broaden that to more institutions so that all of us will learn from the next proof of concept, especially when we need to test the settlement of government bonds,” he said.—AOL, GMA Integrated News","{'href': 'https://www.gmanetwork.com', 'title': 'GMA Network'}","cryptocurrency"

How Epstein tried to buy his way Into Bitcoin's inner circle?

The release of the Epstein files on the 30th of January has sent shockwaves through the financial and tech worlds. 

Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the Department of Justice (DOJ) published a staggering 3.5 million pages of records, providing a sneak peek into how Jeffrey Epstein maintained a shadow network of influence long after his 2008 conviction. 

Among the most bizarre revelations are his 2016 a ttempts to broker a deal involving the “founders of Bitcoin” and a new Middle Eastern currency.

Deep within the DOJ dump, specifically in “Data Set 9”, investigators found a series of emails from October 2016.

 In these messages, Epstein pitched a financial project to Saudi Arabian royals and high-level financiers. 

He proposed a fiat currency called “the Sharia,” designed for internal use within the Muslim world.

The proposal was of a physical currency stamped with “In God We Trust,” mimicking the U.S. Dollar but tailored to Islamic religious sensibilities. 

However, the shocking twist was the backend technology. 

Epstein suggested a digital version of this currency powered by blockchain, claiming he was in direct contact with the “founders of Bitcoin” who were very excited about the project.

Additionally, Epstein's use of the plural “founders” has reignited the long-running debate over the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.

For years, crypto enthusiasts have argued that Bitcoin [BTC] may have been created by a group rather than a single individual.

Although Epstein's emails offer no definitive proof, they show that he actively tried to position himself as a gatekeeper to the anonymous creators of the world's largest cryptocurrency.

Beyond the sensational emails, the files also reveal how Epstein sought to exert influence in more concrete ways.

Between 2013 and 2017, he donated approximately $525,000 to the MIT Media Lab, directing the funds toward the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI).

After the Bitcoin Foundation collapsed in 2014, the DCI became the primary paymaster for several Bitcoin Core developers.

While Epstein never controlled Bitcoin's decentralized code, the records make that clear.

They also show that he operated within institutional circles where key discussions about the technology's future were taking place.

Yet, the breather here is that despite the alarming headlines, crypto faces no real threat.

The 2026 DOJ release highlights Epstein's exaggerated sense of influence rather than any genuine flaw in blockchain technology.

Needless to say, Bitcoin operates as an open-source system wherein thousands of independent developers actively review and maintain it.

This structure prevents any single donor, regardless of wealth or notoriety, from secretly altering the code or installing a backdoor.

Thus, the episode shows how power-seeking figures often try to attach themselves to emerging technologies, only to learn they cannot control them.

A newsletter built for market enthusiasts by market enthusiasts. Top stories, top movers, and trade ideas delivered to your inbox every weekday before and after the market closes.

Barry Silbert, CEO of cryptocurrency conglomerate Digital Currency Group, described the latest cryptocurrency crash as a god-sent opportunity poised to trigger significant capital inflows back into the sector.

In an X post, Silbert referred to the market slump as a “gift from the crypto gods,” suggesting that it is clearing out excess leverage and “crap tokens.” 

“A massive capital rotation into crypto is about to begin. Time to pick your fighter,” the cryptocurrency mogul projected.

Silbert's forecast follows a sharp market drop over the weekend, pushing Bitcoin and Ethereum to their lowest levels in months. Bitcoin, for instance, sank below $75,000, hitting levels last seen in April.

Nearly $800 million was liquidated from the market in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass, with $600 million in levered longs wiped out. The market sentiment plunged into “Extreme Fear” territory.

Notably, Michael Saylor, who spearheads Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR), hinted the company would buy the latest dip and add to its Bitcoin position.

Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $76,926.08, down 2.15% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

Bitmine staked ETH stands at 2,873,459 and MAVAN staking solution on track to launch Q1 2026

Bitmine now owns 3.55% of the ETH token supply, over 70% of the way to the 'Alchemy of 5%' in just 6 months

Bitmine recently closed on initial $200 million investment into Beast Industries

Bitmine Crypto + Total Cash Holdings + ""Moonshots"" total $10.7 billion, including 4.285 million ETH tokens, total cash of $586 million, and other crypto holdings

Bitmine leads crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of BMNR stock

Bitmine is the 105th most traded stock in the US, trading $1.1 billion per day (5-day avg)

Bitmine remains supported by a premier group of institutional investors including ARK's Cathie Wood, MOZAYYX, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, Galaxy Digital and personal investor Thomas ""Tom"" Lee to support Bitmine's goal of acquiring 5% of ETH

LAS VEGAS, Feb. 2, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (""Bitmine"" or the ""Company"") a Bitcoin and Ethereum Network company with a focus on the accumulation of crypto for long term investment, today announced Bitmine crypto + total cash + ""moonshots"" holdings totaling $10.7 billion.

As of February 1st, 2026 at 6:00pm ET, the Company's crypto holdings are comprised of 4,285,125 ETH at $2,317 per ETH (Coinbase), 193 Bitcoin (BTC), $200 million stake in Beast Industries, $20 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) (""moonshots"") and total cash of $586 million. Bitmine's ETH holdings are 3.55% of the ETH supply (of 120.7 million ETH).

""ETH prices have dropped sharply in the past month from ~$3,000 to ~$2,300. This occurred while Ethereum daily transactions hit an all-time high (ATH) of 2.5mm (per theblock.co) and active addresses soared in 2026 to an ATH to 1 million daily (per theblock.co). In other words, Ethereum on-chain activity and fundamentals have grown solidly in the past few months, but ETH prices have declined. During the crypto winter of 2021-2022 or 2018-2019, Ethereum transaction activity and active wallets declined, which is counter to what we have seen in the past 12 months,"" said Thomas ""Tom"" Lee, Executive Chairman of Bitmine.

""Thus, non-fundamental factors are arguably more the factors explaining the weakness in ETH prices. Foremost, in our view, is that leverage has not returned yet to crypto as the October 10th ripple effects continue. The second factor is the surge in precious metals prices, which have acted as a 'vortex' sucking away risk appetite from crypto. That said, Gold seems to be following 1979-1980 closely. What confirmed the top in January 1980 was a -13% daily decline on January 22, 1980. On January 30, 2026, Gold fell -9%, its 4th largest ever daily decline. Each of the prior 3 larger declines marked a near-term top,"" said Lee.

""In the past week, we acquired 41,788 ETH,"" continued Lee. ""Bitmine has been steadily buying Ethereum, as we view this pullback as attractive, given the strengthening fundamentals. In our view, the price of ETH is not reflective of the high utility of ETH and its role as the future of finance.""

As of February 1, 2026, Bitmine total staked ETH stands at 2,897,459 ($6.7 billion at $2,317 per ETH). This is an increase of 888,192 in the past week. ""Bitmine has staked more ETH than other entities in the world. At scale (when Bitmine's ETH is fully staked by MAVAN and its staking partners), the ETH staking rewards is $374 million annually (using 2.81% CESR), or greater than $1 million per day,"" stated Lee.

""Annualized staking revenues are now $188 million, up +18% in the past week (see chart). And this 2.9 million ETH is about 67% of the 4.3 million ETH held by Bitmine. The CESR (Composite Ethereum Staking Rate, administered by Quatrefoil) is 2.81%. We continue to make progress on our staking solution known as The Made in America VAlidator Network (MAVAN). This will be the 'best-in-class' solution offering secure staking infrastructure and will be deployed in early calendar 2026. Bitmine is currently working with 3 staking providers as the Company moves towards unveiling MAVAN in 2026,"" continued Lee.

Bitmine crypto holding reigns as the #1 Ethereum treasury and #2 global treasury, behind Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR), which owns 712,647 BTC valued at $55 billion. Bitmine remains the largest ETH treasury in the world. 

Bitmine is one of the most widely traded stocks in the US. According to data from Fundstrat, the stock has traded average daily dollar volume of $1.1 billion (5-day average, as of January 30, 2026), ranking #105 in the US, behind Schlumberger NV (rank #104) and ahead of Humana (rank #106) among 5,704 US-listed stocks (statista.com and Fundstrat research).

The GENIUS Act and Securities and Exchange Commission's (""the SEC"") Project Crypto are as transformational to financial services in 2025 as US action on August 15, 1971 ending Bretton Woods and the USD on the gold standard 54 years ago. This 1971 event was the catalyst for the modernization of Wall Street, creating the iconic Wall Street titans and financial and payment rails of today. These proved to be better investments than gold.

Is it too soon to say crypto winter? Perhaps. But it certainly is getting ugly out there: Asset prices are in freefall, key legislation hangs by a thread, and members of Crypto Twitter fret it's their turn to learn what it's like to “have fun staying poor.” One company, though, is sitting pretty amid all this. That would be Tether, which last week reported $10 billion in profits for 2025, and has amassed so much gold it's now storing bars of the stuff in Swiss bunkers from World War II.

I recently sat down with Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino, whose view of crypto and the future is the subject of my latest Fortune magazine feature. The vision Ardoino shared is a dark one: He thinks Europe—and possibly the West more broadly—is on the cusp of a cultural and economic death spiral, and that new forms of decentralized technology offer the best hope for surviving this coming collapse.

This technology includes new currency networks, including the USDT stablecoin, which has become so popular in parts of Africa that “Tether” has become a verb. During our chat, however, Ardoino made clear he views Tether as much bigger than crypto. He sees a world where people communicate over P2P servers that lie beyond the reach of giant telecom companies. Tether, he thinks, can help provide this service as well as decentralized options for things like cloud computing and even farming.

This may sound pie-in-the-sky, but Tether is a company to take seriously. The company is sitting on a gusher of revenue thanks to the interest it earns on USDT's reserves. And unlike here in the U.S., where Coinbase and banks are in a lobbying slugfest over how to share that revenue with consumers, Ardoino says Tether's overseas customers are not particularly concerned about yield. That means it will continue to have billions to invest in its decentralized dreams—and, indeed, it has already laid out billions to invest in P2P versions of social media, AI, satellites, and more.

The question is whether any of this can work. I'm intrigued by the idea of new forms of global, permissionless technologies gaining traction. And I fear that Ardoino may be right in predicting that demand for these P2P services—including crypto—will accelerate as governments grow more dysfunctional.

But I'm also skeptical about Tether's proposals to rewire entire societies around decentralized services. This may be possible in small, homogeneous populations like those of El Salvador or Suriname—countries that Ardoino regards as model societies—but it doesn't sound very realistic for places like the U.S. or China.

Time will tell where Ardoino's view of decentralization will catch on but, for now, it's enough to say Tether, despite its controversies, is a company to watch closely. And speaking of big names in crypto, I'm pleased to announce that Fortune this spring will be dropping the inaugural Crypto 100 list—a first of its kind ranking of leading firms in ten categories in the tradition of the Fortune 500. More details soon.

Justin Sun plans to add between $50 million and $100 million worth of bitcoin BTC$78,885.00 to the blockchain's holdings, the Tron founder told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin fell as low as $74,674 during the Asian morning on Monday, its lowest point since last April with BTC now having lost 21% of its value since Jan. 15.

It would mark as astute purchase in comparison to the hoards of digital asset treasury (DAT) companies that raised money to purchase crypto at record highs last year, many of which are now facing losses of more than 30% on their holdings, according to bitcointreasuries.

As CME's futures market closed on Friday, the bitcoin BTC$77,528.46 derivatives were priced at $84,445 on the exchange. When trading resumed Sunday evening, they opened at $77,385 reflecting the largest cryptocurrency's spot-market slide to as low as $75,000 on Saturday. This price discrepancy created a gap in the CME bitcoin futures pricing.

A CME gap is the difference between the futures price at closing time and the price when the exchange next opens. Because, unlike spot BTC, the futures do not trade 24/7, significant price moves can occur during daily maintenance breaks or over weekends to produce the gaps.

These gaps are closely watched by traders. Historically, they tend to fill within days or weeks, though sometimes over a longer timeframe. While gap-filling is an observed tendency rather than a certainty, it seems to occur more often than not.

As of press time, spot bitcoin is trading around $77,800, while CME bitcoin futures are priced near $78,230. This places the futures roughly 7%-8% below Friday's CME close.

CME bitcoin futures are cash settled contracts designed to track the price of the largest cryptocurrency. Trading pauses for an hour a day and remains closed over the weekend.

Hyperliquid's token, HYPE, climbed 10% over the past 24 hours after the decentralized exchange detailed HIP-4, a proposal to bring “outcome” trading to its platform. 

The new contract type would support prediction markets and options-style derivatives, both long-requested features, according to the team.

""There has been extensive user demand in both of these areas, and builders will likely think of novel applications as well,"" Hyperliquid wrote in a post on X.

Outcomes are fully collateralized contracts that settle at a fixed price within a specified range. They introduce dated markets and non-linear payoffs to Hyperliquid's system, which until now has focused on perpetual futures. Unlike traditional leveraged derivatives, outcomes do not require margin trading or risk liquidations.

Outcome trading will launch on testnet first, with mainnet deployment to follow once technical development is complete. Hyperliquid plans to start with a curated set of markets before potentially opening the system to permissionless listings, pending user feedback, it said.

HYPE gained traction over the past month after the exchange's permissionless markets, which allow anyone to create markets on assets like crypto, stocks, and gold by staking 500,000 HYPE tokens, have exploded to record highs.

6 weird groundhog facts for Groundhog Day

Groundhogs don't really forecast the weather, but there are plenty of other strange things about these rodents

By K. R. Callaway edited by Andrea Thompson

Groundhogs are unique, and it's not just because of their annual weather forecasts

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

Since at least 1886, a groundhog now named Punxsutawney Phil has emerged from his burrow every Groundhog Day to predict when winter weather will end. Other groundhogs (Marmota monax) around the country have joined him in this climatological soothsaying. Folklore, likely stemming from Celtic mid-season festivals, dictates that if Phil sees his shadow, winter will continue for six more weeks, whereas if he doesn't, spring will come early. (Many people around the country are probably hoping that shadow doesn't appear after recent winter weather.)

Of course, Phil's “forecasts” are actually no better than chance, but thousands, drawn by the allure of an unusual event for an unusual creature, still gather to see him emerge every February 2.

To celebrate these odd critters, here are six of the weirdest facts about groundhogs, one for each week of winter we might have left.

When groundhogs emerge this time of year, they are actually more interested in finding mates than making forecasts. The first ones to go aboveground are usually males that take a few days to mark their territory and gauge potential partners before they head back into their burrows for another month of hibernation.

Groundhogs' teeth never stop growing, so gnawing on things to keep them from getting too long is essential. The animals usually use their powerfully regenerative teeth to break off pieces of food, defend themselves and gather materials they might use to build their nests.

From the surface, a groundhog's burrow might just look like a hole in the ground, but inside, it can be elaborate. Burrows frequently have distinct chambers that act as bathrooms and bedrooms, multiple entrances and tunnels twisting through the earth that total as much as 65 feet in length.

As groundhogs dig deep to create their burrows, they have sometimes stumbled upon historical relics. In at least three cases, groundhogs have helped locate new archeological sites—including one of the oldest known sites of human habitation in North America: Pennsylvania's Meadowcroft Rockshelter.

Archeology isn't the only science groundhogs help us with—they also help medical researchers better understand the connection between hepatitis B (HBV) and liver cancer. Because the groundhog equivalent of HBV is so similar to that in humans, researchers can use them as a stand-in for people to better understand how HBV causes liver issues.

Groundhogs are conspicuous critters—the largest ground-dwelling rodent in the squirrel (Sciuridae) family—and are found throughout much of North America. Their ubiquity means lots of groups, including Indigenous Americans, have had a chance to name them. Besides “groundhog,” a few of the more common names include woodchuck and whistle-pig, referring to the “chuck” and “whistle” sounds they make or their stocky build.

Ionizing radiation apparently didn't prevent some types of bacteria from breeding in the water, but astonishingly, they are not the radiation-resistant types expected in an environment like this.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Following the 2011 tsunami that caused massive meltdowns in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, Japan shut down all of its nuclear operations. Recently, however, Japan restarted one of Fukushima's surviving reactors—but that reactor was not the only thing to survive the disaster. 

During the time that the Fukushima plant was abandoned, water seeped into radioactive waste that remained within the reactor buildings. Soon, an environment assumed to be uninhabitable was actually crawling with microbes. Microbes can be a major obstacle during the cleanup that comes with decommissioning nuclear power plants, since many species corrode metal, and swarms of them can turn water murky and reduce visibility. 

Recently, biologists Tomoro Warashina and Akio Kanai from Keio University in Tokyo made an extraordinary discovery when they analyzed samples of microbes taken from the highly radioactive water inside the power plant's torus room, below the reactor building. Bacteria with no special genetic resistance to the harmful effects of radiation were thriving in the sludge. In the face of a nuclear disaster, organisms either perish or evolve. Mutations have made it possible for everything from wolves to a nearly indestructible black mold to thrive in the otherwise hostile environment of Chernobyl even decades later. This is why the scientists expected to find radiation-resistant microbial species such as Deinococcus radiodurans or Methylobacterium radiotolerans in their samples.

As the team explained in a study recently published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, the microbiome they analyzed had been exposed to persistent radiation, and gathering information about such microorganisms is vital for understanding how to deal sustainably with stagnant, radioactive water environments during decommissioning work. “Certain microorganisms are known to have mechanisms that confer resistance to high levels of ionizing radiation,” they wrote.

After testing their water samples for genetic markers of different microbes, Warashina and Kanai discovered that it was teeming with bacteria from the Limnobacter and Brevirhabdus genera. These chemolithotrophic bacteria make their living by oxidizing inorganic compounds such as manganese or sulfides. Sulfur oxidizers benefit from the sulfite oxidase enzyme, which is secreted by their mitochondria and detoxes sulfides by breaking down amino acids containing sulfur. They turn sulfides into harmless sulfates. The scientists also found a smaller amount of iron oxidizers from the Hoeflea and Sphinopyxis genera, which live by converting one form of iron to another.

None of the species found by Kanai and Warashina have superpowers for radiation resistance. Yet despite high levels of ionizing radiation that would have been toxic to many other forms of life, these bacteria were able to thrive. The question is, how? The study's authors observed that the mixture of emergency cooling water and seawater inside the torus room appeared to support the growth of biofilms on the surfaces of metals. Metals are commonly oxidized and corroded by these bacteria, and the scientists reasoned that it's possible the slime covering such bacterial masses may have actually given them extra protection from radiation. The research team also analyzed the microbial communities to see which ones caused the most corrosion and would therefore need to be targeted to prevent metals from breaking down further during the decommissioning process.

“The proportions of bacterial genera known to be radiation resistant were extremely low, suggesting that the impact of radioactivity on selection within the torus room water was minimal,” they said. “In contrast, [most] of the bacterial genera in the torus room water were associated with metal corrosion, indicating that the impact of bacteria on metal corrosion must be considered in long-term decommissioning work.”

Another thing that caught the team's interest was that many of the microbes found in the torus room also thrive in the ocean. It is possible that these bacteria crashed in with the waves of the tsunami or that something about their adaptations to a marine environment also helps them stay alive in the bowels of a dead nuclear reactor. Life, uh, finds a way.

The team behind NASA's six-wheeled Mars explorer tested a vision-enabled artificial intelligence system to map a safe route across the Martian surface without relying on human route planners.

NASA's Perseverance rover has now completed the first drives on another planet that were planned by artificial intelligence. The milestone demonstration took place on Dec. 8 and 10 and was led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. During the test, generative AI was used to select waypoints for the rover, a complex planning task that is normally handled by human experts on Earth.

""This demonstration shows how far our capabilities have advanced and broadens how we will explore other worlds,"" said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. ""Autonomous technologies like this can help missions to operate more efficiently, respond to challenging terrain, and increase science return as distance from Earth grows. It's a strong example of teams applying new technology carefully and responsibly in real operations.""

How Vision AI Helped Navigate the Martian Surface

For the demonstration, engineers used a form of generative AI known as vision-language models to examine existing data from JPL's surface mission dataset. The system analyzed the same images and information that human planners typically use, then identified waypoint locations so Perseverance could travel safely across difficult Martian terrain.

The work was coordinated from JPL's Rover Operations Center (ROC) and carried out in collaboration with Anthropic, using the company's Claude AI models.

Why Mars Rover Routes Are Hard to Plan

Mars sits an average of about 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) from Earth. That distance creates long communication delays, making real-time control of a rover impossible. For nearly three decades, rover navigation has depended on human drivers who carefully study terrain data and plan routes in advance.

These planners design paths made up of waypoints, usually spaced no more than 330 feet (100 meters) apart, to reduce the risk of encountering hazards. The completed plans are sent through NASA's Deep Space Network, and the rover carries out the instructions on its own.

AI Takes Over Route Planning for Perseverance

During Perseverance's drives on the 1,707 and 1,709 Martian days, known as sols, the mission team shifted that responsibility to generative AI. The system examined high-resolution orbital images captured by the HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, along with terrain slope data from digital elevation models.

Using this information, the AI identified important surface features such as bedrock, outcrops, boulder fields, and sand ripples. It then produced a continuous driving path that included all necessary waypoints.

Before sending the commands to Mars, engineers ran the AI-generated instructions through JPL's digital twin (virtual replica of the rover). This step checked more than 500,000 telemetry variables to ensure the plan would work safely with Perseverance's flight software.

On Dec. 8, Perseverance traveled 689 feet (210 meters) using the AI-generated plan. Two days later, it drove another 807 feet (246 meters).

What This Means for Future Space Exploration

""The fundamental elements of generative AI are showing a lot of promise in streamlining the pillars of autonomous navigation for off-planet driving: perception (seeing the rocks and ripples), localization (knowing where we are), and planning and control (deciding and executing the safest path),"" said Vandi Verma, a space roboticist at JPL and a member of the Perseverance engineering team. ""We are moving towards a day where generative AI and other smart tools will help our surface rovers handle kilometer-scale drives while minimizing operator workload, and flag interesting surface features for our science team by scouring huge volumes of rover images.""

""Imagine intelligent systems not only on the ground at Earth, but also in edge applications in our rovers, helicopters, drones, and other surface elements trained with the collective wisdom of our NASA engineers, scientists, and astronauts,"" said Matt Wallace, manager of JPL's Exploration Systems Office. ""That is the game-changing technology we need to establish the infrastructure and systems required for a permanent human presence on the Moon and take the U.S. to Mars and beyond.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Baby dinosaurs were the backbone of the Jurassic food chain","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260201223727.htm","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 03:52:59 GMT","

A new study led by a researcher from UCL (University College London) finds that baby and very young sauropods were critical to sustaining predators during the Late Jurassic. Sauropods were long necked, long tailed plant eaters that grew into the largest animals ever to walk on land, yet their earliest life stages were small, exposed, and highly vulnerable.

The research was published in the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin and draws on fossil evidence dating back roughly 150 million years. These fossils come from the Morrison Formation* in the United States and were used to reconstruct a detailed food web, showing how plants, herbivores, and carnivores were linked through feeding relationships.

Defenseless Young in a Predator Rich Ecosystem

The study shows that juvenile sauropods were a major food source for several species of meat eating dinosaurs. These young animals lacked effective defenses and appear to have been left to survive on their own, making them especially easy targets.

Lead author Dr. Cassius Morrison of UCL Earth Sciences explained the contrast between adult size and early vulnerability. He said: ""Adult sauropods such as the Diplodocus and Brachiosaurus were longer than a blue whale. When they walked the earth would shake. Their eggs, though, were just a foot wide and once hatched their offspring would take many years to grow.

""Size alone would make it difficult for sauropods to look after their eggs without destroying them, and evidence suggests that, much like baby turtles today, young sauropods were not looked after by their parents.

""Life was cheap in this ecosystem and the lives of predators such as the Allosaurus were likely fueled by the consumption of these baby sauropods.""

Fossils From a Single Jurassic Quarry

Much of the data came from the Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry in Colorado, a site known for its exceptionally rich fossil record. The quarry preserves remains deposited over a span of up to about 10,000 years and includes at least six species of sauropod (among them a Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus, and Apatosaurus).

To determine who ate whom, the researchers combined multiple lines of evidence. These included body size, patterns of tooth wear, chemical clues such as isotope levels preserved in fossil remains, and in rare cases fossilized stomach contents that revealed an animal's last meal.

Using this information, the team reconstructed the Jurassic food web in greater detail than previously achieved for dinosaurs. They relied on software commonly used to analyze modern ecosystems to map all possible feeding connections among dinosaurs, other animals, and plants.

Why Sauropods Dominated the Food Web

The analysis showed that sauropods played a central role in the ecosystem. They were connected to far more plants and predators than other major plant eating dinosaurs, particularly the ornithischians (plant-eaters such as the armored Stegosaurus who were more dangerous prey).

Dr. Morrison said: ""Sauropods had a dramatic impact on their ecosystem. Our study allows us to measure and quantify the role they had for the first time.

""Reconstructing food webs means we can more easily compare dinosaur ecosystems across different periods. It helps us to understand evolutionary pressures and why dinosaurs might have evolved in the way they did.""

From Abundant Prey to Powerful Predators

The researchers also noted how these dynamics may have influenced later dinosaur evolution. About 70 million years later, during the time of Tyrannosaurus Rex, fewer sauropods were available as easy prey. This change may have driven the evolution of traits such as stronger bite force, larger body size, and improved vision, enabling T. Rex to hunt larger and more dangerous animals like Triceratops, which were armed with three large horns.

William Hart, a co-author from Hofstra University in the United States, said: ""The apex predators of the Late Jurassic, such as the Allosaurus or the Torvosaurus, may have had an easier time acquiring food compared to the T. Rex millions of years later.

""Some Allosaurus fossils show signs of quite horrific injuries -- for instance caused by the spiked tail of a Stegosaurus -- that had healed and some which hadn't. But an abundance of easy prey in the form of young sauropods may have allowed injured allosaurs to survive.""

Notes

*The Morrison Formation is a prominent sequence of Upper Jurassic sedimentary rock (approx. 156-147 million years old) spanning 1.5 million square kilometers across the western United States. Known as North America's most fertile source of dinosaur fossils, it contains massive deposits of mudstone, sandstone, and limestone from ancient rivers and floodplains.

The study involved researchers from institutions in the UK, the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands.

The global demand for critical metals is rising quickly, prompting many countries to explore the possibility of extracting these valuable resources from the ocean floor. A new international study has revealed that this push toward deep-sea mining may have less overall environmental impact than scientists once feared. At the same time, the research shows clear local damage, with species diversity dropping by about one third along the paths cut by mining equipment.

The study also uncovered a major surprise. Hundreds of previously unknown species were found living nearly 4,000 meters below the ocean's surface, highlighting just how little is known about these remote environments.

Exploring One of Earth's Least Known Ecosystems

Marine biologists from multiple countries joined forces in a large research effort to document life on the deep-sea floor of the Pacific Ocean, one of the most unexplored regions on the planet.

The research, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, was driven in part by growing commercial and geopolitical interest in the area.

""Critical metals are needed for our green transition, and they are in short supply. Several of these metals are found in large quantities on the deep-sea floor, but until now, no one has shown how they can be extracted or what environmental impact this would have,"" says marine biologist Thomas Dahlgren, that together with Helena Wiklund, also at the University of Gothenburg, have participated in the research project.

Five Years of Research and 160 Days at Sea

The project followed the International Seabed Authority's (ISA) guidelines for baseline studies and environmental impact assessments (see fact box).

Over five years, researchers cataloged marine life and tested mining impacts in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a vast region of the Pacific Ocean located between Mexico and Hawaii. The results showed that areas directly disturbed by mining equipment experienced a 37 percent decline in animal numbers and a 32 percent reduction in species diversity.

""The research required 160 days at sea and five years of work. Our study will be important for the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which regulates mineral mining in international waters,"" says Thomas Dahlgren.

Life at 4,000 Meters Below the Surface

The study area lies 4,000 meters beneath the ocean surface, where sunlight never reaches and food is extremely limited. In this environment, the sediment layer grows at a rate of just one thousandth of a millimeter per year.

To put the scarcity of life into perspective, a single seafloor sample from the North Sea can contain up to 20,000 animals. A similar sample from the deep Pacific seabed contains roughly the same number of species, but only about 200 individual animals.

Researchers collected 4,350 animals larger than 0.3 mm living in and on the seabed. From these samples, 788 species were identified. Most belonged to groups such as marine bristle worms, crustaceans, and mollusks, including snails and mussels.

The team also identified a new solitaire coral, that are described in another study.

Unknown Species Ranges and Long-Term Risks

""I have been working in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone for over 13 years, and this is by far the largest study that has been conducted. In Gothenburg, we led the identification of marine polychaete worms. Since most species have not been described previously, molecular (DNA) data was crucial in facilitating studies of biodiversity and ecology on the seabed,"" says Thomas Dahlgren.

As the inventory progressed, scientists noticed that deep-sea communities changed naturally over time, likely in response to shifts in how much food reached the ocean floor. However, researchers still do not know how widely these species are distributed across the Pacific's deep-sea regions.

""It is now important to try to predict the risk of biodiversity loss as a result of mining. This requires us to investigate the biodiversity of the 30 percent of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone that has been protected. At present, we have virtually no idea what lives there,"" says Adrian Glover, senior author from the Natural History Museum of London.

An international team led by scientists at Sun Yat-sen University and the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has launched an ambitious experiment known as MACE. The project is designed to look for an extremely rare event in which muonium, a short lived system made of a positive muon bound to an electron, spontaneously transforms into antimuonium, its antimatter counterpart. Observing such a process would break a fundamental rule of particle physics called lepton flavor conservation, which is a key part of the Standard Model, and would provide direct evidence for physics beyond existing theories.

""The conversion of muonium to antimuonium represents a clean and unique probe of new physics in the leptonic sector,"" explains the research team. ""Unlike other charged lepton flavor violation processes, this conversion is sensitive to ∆Lℓ = 2 models that are fundamentally distinct and could reveal physics inaccessible to other experiments.""

Pushing Experimental Sensitivity to New Limits

The most recent experimental constraint on muonium converting into antimuonium was established in 1999 at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. MACE aims to go far beyond that result by improving sensitivity by more than a hundred times, with the goal of detecting conversion probabilities as small as O(10-13). Reaching this level requires advances throughout the entire experimental system, including a powerful surface muon beam, a newly developed silica aerogel target, and detectors capable of extremely precise measurements.

""Our design integrates advanced beam, muonium production target, and detector technology to isolate the signal from formidable backgrounds,"" says the team. ""This makes MACE one of the most sensitive low-energy experiments searching for lepton flavor violation.""

What a Discovery Could Reveal

If the experiment succeeds, it could allow scientists to explore new physics at energy scales ranging from 10 to 100 TeV, a level that rivals or even surpasses what future particle colliders are expected to achieve. MACE is also planned to operate in an initial Phase I stage, during which it will investigate other exceptionally rare muonium decay processes and lepton flavor violating events, including M→γγ and μ→eγγ, with record breaking sensitivity.

The impact of MACE extends beyond fundamental physics. Technologies developed for the experiment, such as advanced muonium production targets, low energy positron transport systems, and high resolution detectors, may also find uses in fields like materials science and medical research.

Strengthening Global Particle Physics Efforts

MACE is part of a larger scientific push centered on Huizhou's major research facilities, including the High-intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) and the China initiative Accelerator Driven System (CiADS). Together, these projects aim to establish China as a global leader in high precision nuclear and particle physics. By drawing on these advanced facilities, MACE demonstrates how basic research can fuel both technological progress and international collaboration.

""We are not just building an experiment; we are opening a new window into the laws of nature,"" the team notes. ""Each component of MACE -- from the beamline to the software -- has been optimized to explore physics that could redefine our understanding of matter, symmetry, and the universe itself.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Medieval miracles: Dragon-slaying saints once healed the land","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260201231255.htm","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:38:35 GMT","

New research suggests that the Vatican's recently opened eco-friendly farm reflects a long forgotten chapter in Catholic history. The farm was inaugurated by the first ever Augustinian pope and, according to historian Dr. Krisztina Ilko, mirrors the early values and practices of his religious order. Her work challenges long held assumptions about the medieval Catholic Church and the early Renaissance, especially the belief that religious power was centered almost entirely in cities.

Dr. Ilko, a medieval historian at Queens' College, Cambridge, argues that the countryside played a much larger role in shaping Christian life than is commonly acknowledged. Her research highlights a tradition of practical, land-focused miracles that helped rural communities survive during difficult times.

Forgotten Medieval Miracles of the Land

Among the miracles Dr. Ilko has uncovered are stories of a burned cherry twig bursting back into life, a diseased swamp restored to ""peak fertility,"" a broken ox leg healed, and cabbages multiplied to feed communities. These accounts come from medieval sources that have largely been overlooked or dismissed.

""Bleeding hosts and stigmatizations are the best-known medieval miracles,"" says Dr. Ilko, author of The Sons of St Augustine, a major new study published by OUP today.

""The Augustinians get very little credit for miraculously making land fertile, healing livestock and bringing fruit trees back to life,"" says Ilko.

""With Leo XIV becoming the first Augustinian Pope, it's the perfect time to make the order's astonishing history better known. There has been so much focus on Italian cities, we've lost sight of how important the countryside was to the Church and to the Renaissance.""

Dragons, Disease, and Fertility

Saint George is widely known as Christianity's most famous dragon slayer and is commonly depicted as a warrior holding a lance. Much less familiar is Guglielmo of Malavalle, a twelfth century hermit venerated by the Augustinians for defeating a dragon using a simple wooden staff shaped like a pitchfork.

In medieval Europe, illness affecting people, animals, and crops was often blamed on dragons. Their breath was believed to poison the air and suffocate the land, especially in swampy regions where disease was common.

After hearing a voice from the sky, Guglielmo settled in Malavalle, meaning ""the bad valley,"" in the marshy Maremma region of Tuscany. The area was thought to be so polluted by toxic air and violent storms that it had become barren and frightening, described as ""dark, and terrible,"" and avoided even by hunters.

Dr. Ilko argues that Guglielmo's reputation as a dragon slayer came from his role in cleansing the environment and restoring the valley's productivity.

""These achievements weren't symbolic, Guglielmo provided a crucial public service, he helped country people survive in a really harsh natural environment,"" Dr. Ilko says.

""Guglielmo was a pitchfork-wielding dragon slayer and divine gardener all at once. Commanding the weather, securing a good harvest, and restoring the health of livestock must have seemed the most desirable divine interventions in the late medieval countryside. They were matters of life and death.""

Unearthing Lost Augustinian Texts

Dr. Ilko's conclusions are based on ten years of research that took her to more than twenty archives and over sixty Augustinian sites, including remote and difficult to access ruins. She examined frescoes, illuminated manuscripts, hagiographies, and letters, uncovering materials that had been misdated or wrongly attributed. These errors, she argues, contributed to the Augustinians being overlooked in studies of medieval miracles.

One of the earliest collections of Augustinian biographies she studied was written by a Florentine friar in the 1320s. The manuscript has received little scholarly attention, which Dr. Ilko believes is because its miracles were considered too rural in focus. The text is held at Florence's Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana.

The manuscript opens with the life of Giovanni of Florence, who built the Augustinian hermitage of Santa Lucia in Larniano with help from local farmers. One of Giovanni's most notable miracles involved healing an ox with a broken leg. Another account describes Jacopo of Rosia ordering an unreliable apple tree to bear fruit every year and multiplying cabbages.

""When people think about religious orders and their massive role in the Renaissance, they usually turn their attention to cities like Rome, Florence and Siena,"" Dr. Ilko says.

""The Franciscans and Dominicans, in particular, are credited for Italy's rapid urban renewal from the 1200s onwards. Not many people realize that the Augustinians drew most of their power from the countryside. Their miracles were very green-fingered, agricultural.""

""St Francis of Assisi remains the most famous 'nature saint', best known for preaching to birds. In a more eco-conscious world, the Augustinians deserve much more attention.""

How the Augustinians Secured Their Survival

According to Dr. Ilko, the Augustinians' close relationship with forests, mountains, and coastal areas was key to their survival as a religious order.

The Order of the Hermits of St Augustine was established in 1256 when the papacy объединed several hermit groups from central Italy into a single mendicant order. In 1274, the Roman Catholic Church questioned the order's legitimacy because it had been founded after 1215 and lacked a continuous presence dating back to late antiquity. The papacy did not formally confirm the order's existence until 1298. During this twenty five year period of uncertainty, Augustinian friars worked intensely to justify their place within the Church.

Without a single charismatic founder, the friars developed an origin story that claimed direct ties to St Augustine himself. Dr. Ilko argues that they also relied on their strong presence in natural landscapes to reinforce their authority and ancient roots.

""Direct contact with nature gave the friars legitimacy, special spiritual powers and access to valuable natural resources including timber, crops and wild animals,"" Dr. Ilko says.

As the order expanded into cities, the Augustinians carefully chose locations near the edge of urban life. In Rome, they founded the convent of Santa Maria del Popolo at one of the city's main entrances, with trees and gardens nearby. The Franciscans had previously rejected the site because it was considered too remote and difficult ""to sustain the body."" The area was once viewed as ominous, dominated by an ancient walnut tree believed to be infested with demons and marking the supposed burial place of Emperor Nero. Pope Paschall II ordered the tree removed in 1099.

Beyond reshaping how the Augustinians are understood, Dr. Ilko argues that the ruins of their hermitages deserve better preservation and improved public access so more people can experience this overlooked chapter of religious and environmental history.

Retrospective studies suggest that early time-of-day (ToD) infusions of immunochemotherapy may improve efficacy. However, prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to validate it. In this randomized phase 3 LungTIME-C01 trial, 210 patients with treatment naive stage IIIC–IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lacking driver mutations were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either an early or late ToD group, defined by the administration of the first four cycles of an anti-PD-1 agent before or after 15:00 h. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), while secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). After a median follow-up of 28.7 months, the median PFS was 11.3 months (95% confidence interval (CI) = 9.2–13.4) in the early ToD group and 5.7 months (95% CI = 5.2–6.2) in the late ToD group, corresponding to a hazard ratio (HR) for earlier disease progression of 0.40 (95% CI = 0.29–0.55; P < 0.001). The median OS was 28.0 months (95% CI = not estimable (NE)–NE) in the early ToD group and 16.8 months (95% CI = 13.7–19.9) in the late ToD group, corresponding to an HR of an earlier death of 0.42 (95% CI = 0.29–0.60; P < 0.001). Treatment-related adverse events were consistent with the established safety profile, with no new safety signals observed. No significant differences in immune-related adverse events were observed between the two groups. Over the first four cycles, morning circulating CD8+ T cells increased in the early ToD group, whereas they declined in the late ToD group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the ratio of activated (CD38+ HLA-DR+) versus exhausted (TIM-3+PD-1+) CD8+ T cells was higher in the early ToD group (P < 0.001) compared with the late ToD group (P < 0.001). In summary, our study indicates that early ToD immunochemotherapy substantially improves PFS and OS and is associated with enhanced antitumor CD8+ T cell characteristics compared with late ToD treatment.

(a) Distribution of first 4 infusion times among 210 patients, who were divided into early time-of-day (ToD) infusion group and late ToD group. (b) Histogram of median times of the first 4 infusions per patient (n = 210).

(a) Forest plots of the univariate and multivariate Cox regression results for progression-free survival (PFS) (n = 210). (b) Forest plots of the univariate and multivariate Cox regression results for overall survival (OS) (n = 210). P values (two-sided), hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals of HRs were estimated using univariable or multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, and P values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Data are presented as HR (points) with 95% CIs (horizontal lines). ICI, immune checkpoint inhibitor. LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma. LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma. ECOG PS, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status. LIPI, Lung Immune Prognostic Index.

The tumor response was assessed by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC) (n = 210). P values were determined using a two-sided chi-square test. ToD, time-of-day. PR, partial response. SD, stable disease. PD, progressive disease.

Patient values are normalized to individual baseline levels and assessed after 2 cycles (prior to cycle 3) and 4 cycles (prior to cycle 5) of treatment. Line-point graphs depict dynamic changes of CD3+ T cell proportion (a), CD8+ T cell proportion (b), CD4+ T cell proportion (f), B cell proportion (g), NK cell proportion (h) and CD8+/CD4+ T cell ratio (i) in individual patients from the early and late time-of-day (ToD) groups. Colored lines link sequential measurements from individual patients. The horizontal dotted line represents the normalized baseline (ratio = 1.0). Linear regressions (solid lines) with shaded 95% confidence intervals illustrate changes in CD4+ T cell proportions (c), B cell proportions (d) and NK cell proportions (e) over time in patients from the early and late time-of-day (ToD) groups. Data are presented as mean ± s.e. of the mean (s.e.m.). Dotted horizontal lines indicate the normalized baseline (ratio = 1.0). P values were determined using a permutation test (two-sided) and two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (two-sided), without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Flow cytometric analyses of CD4+, B and NK cells were performed on paired blood samples collected at baseline, after 2 cycles and after 4 cycles from 61 patients in the early ToD group and 44 patients in the late ToD group (n = 105 total patients; n = 315 total samples).

Representative flow cytometry gating strategy used to identify CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+ T cells and TIM-3+PD-1+CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (a). Linear regressions (solid lines) with shaded 95% confidence intervals illustrate changes in CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cell proportions (b). Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Dotted horizontal lines indicate the normalized baseline (ratio = 1.0). P values were determined using a permutation test (two-sided) and two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (two-sided), without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Line-point graphs depict dynamic changes of CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cell (c), TIM-3+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cell proportion (d) and CD38+ HLA-DR+/ TIM-3+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cell ratio (e) in individual patients from the early and late time-of-day (ToD) groups. Colored lines connect serial measurements from the same patient. Dotted horizontal lines indicate the normalized baseline (ratio = 1.0). PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometric analyses of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T, B and NK cells were performed on paired blood samples collected at baseline, after 2 cycles and after 4 cycles from 61 patients in the early ToD group and 44 patients in the late ToD group (n = 105 total patients; n = 315 total samples). CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells and TIM-3+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cells were assessed in paired cryopreserved PBMCs collected at baseline, after 2 cycles and after 4 cycles from 14 patients in the early ToD group and 25 patients in the late ToD group (n = 39 total patients; n = 117 total samples).

In 1950, in a paper entitled ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence'1, Alan Turing proposed his ‘imitation game'. Now known as the Turing test, it addressed a question that seemed purely hypothetical: could machines display the kind of flexible, general cognitive competence that is characteristic of human thought, such that they could pass themselves off as humans to unaware humans?

Three-quarters of a century later, the answer looks like ‘yes'. In March 2025, the large language model (LLM) GPT-4.5, developed by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, was judged by humans in a Turing test to be human 73% of the time — more often than actual humans were2. Moreover, readers even preferred literary texts generated by LLMs over those written by human experts3.

This is far from all. LLMs have achieved gold-medal performance at the International Mathematical Olympiad, collaborated with leading mathematicians to prove theorems4, generated scientific hypotheses that have been validated in experiments5, solved problems from PhD exams, assisted professional programmers in writing code, composed poetry and much more — including chatting 24/7 with hundreds of millions of people around the world. In other words, LLMs have shown many signs of the sort of broad, flexible cognitive competence that was Turing's focus — what we now call ‘general intelligence', although Turing did not use the term.

What is the future of intelligence? The answer could lie in the story of its evolution

What is the future of intelligence? The answer could lie in the story of its evolution

Yet many experts baulk at saying that current AI models display artificial general intelligence (AGI) — and some doubt that they ever will. A March 2025 survey by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in Washington DC found that 76% of leading researchers thought that scaling up current AI approaches would be ‘unlikely' or ‘very unlikely' to yield AGI (see go.nature.com/4smn16b).

What explains this disconnect? We suggest that the problem is part conceptual, because definitions of AGI are ambiguous and inconsistent; part emotional, because AGI raises fear of displacement and disruption; and part practical, as the term is entangled with commercial interests that can distort assessments. Precisely because AGI dominates public discourse, it is worth engaging with the concept in a more detached way: as a question about intelligence, rather than a pressing concern about social upheaval or an ever-postponed milestone in a business contract.

In writing this Comment, we approached this question from different perspectives — philosophy, machine learning, linguistics and cognitive science — and reached a consensus after extensive discussion. In what follows, we set out why we think that, once you clear away certain confusions, and strive to make fair comparisons and avoid anthropocentric biases, the conclusion is straightforward: by reasonable standards, including Turing's own, we have artificial systems that are generally intelligent. The long-standing problem of creating AGI has been solved. Recognizing this fact matters — for policy, for risk and for understanding the nature of mind and even the world itself.

We assume, as we think Turing would have done, that humans have general intelligence. Some think that general intelligence does not exist at all, even in humans. Although this view is coherent and philosophically interesting, we set it aside here as being too disconnected from most AI discourse. But having made this assumption, how should we characterize general intelligence?

A common informal definition of general intelligence, and the starting point of our discussions, is a system that can do almost all cognitive tasks that a human can do6,7. What tasks should be on that list engenders a lot of debate, but the phrase ‘a human' also conceals a crucial ambiguity. Does it mean a top human expert for each task? Then no individual qualifies — Marie Curie won Nobel prizes in chemistry and physics but was not an expert in number theory. Does it mean a composite human with competence across the board? This, too, seems a high bar — Albert Einstein revolutionized physics, but he couldn't speak Mandarin.

How close is AI to human-level intelligence?

How close is AI to human-level intelligence?

A definition that excludes essentially all humans is not a definition of general intelligence; it is about something else, perhaps ideal expertise or collective intelligence. Rather, general intelligence is about having sufficient breadth and depth of cognitive abilities, with ‘sufficient' anchored by paradigm cases. Breadth means abilities across multiple domains — mathematics, language, science, practical reasoning, creative tasks — in contrast to ‘narrow' intelligences, such as a calculator or a chess-playing program. Depth means strong performance within those domains, not merely superficial engagement.

Human general intelligence admits degrees and variation. Children, average adults and an acknowledged genius such as Einstein all have general intelligence of varying level and profile. Individual humans excel or fall short in different domains. The same flexibility should apply to artificial systems: we should ask whether they have the core cognitive abilities at levels comparable to human-level general intelligence.

Rather than stipulating a definition, we draw on both actual and hypothetical cases of general intelligence — from Einstein to aliens to oracles — to triangulate the contours of the concept and refine it more systematically. Our conclusion: insofar as individual humans have general intelligence, current LLMs do, too.

We can start by identifying four features that are not required for general intelligence.

Perfection. We don't expect a physicist to match Einstein's insights, or a biologist to replicate Charles Darwin's breakthroughs. Few, if any, humans have perfect depth even within specialist areas of competence. Human general intelligence does not require perfection; neither should AGI.

Universality. No individual human can do every cognitive task, and other species have abilities that exceed our own: an octopus can control its eight arms independently; many insects can see parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are invisible to humans. General intelligence does not require universal mastery of these skills; an AGI does not need perfect breadth.

Human similarity. Intelligence is a functional property that can be realized in different substrates — a point Turing embraced in 1950 by setting aside human biology1. Systems demonstrating general intelligence need not replicate human cognitive architecture or understand human cultural references. We would not demand these things of intelligent aliens; the same applies to machines.

Superintelligence. This is generally used to indicate any system that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in almost all areas. Superintelligence and AGI are often conflated, particularly in business contexts, in which ‘superintelligence' often signals economic disruption. No human meets this standard; it should not be a requirement for AGI, either.

What, then, is general intelligence? There is no ‘bright line' test for its presence — any exact threshold is inevitably arbitrary. This might frustrate those who want exact criteria, but the vagueness is a feature, not a bug. Concepts such as ‘life' and ‘health' resist sharp definition yet remain useful; we recognize paradigm cases without needing exact boundaries. Humans are paradigm examples of general intelligence; a pocket calculator lacks it, despite superhuman ability at calculations.

When we assess general intelligence or ability in other humans, we do not attempt to peer inside their heads to verify understanding — we infer it from behaviour, conversation and problem-solving. No single test is definitive, but evidence accumulates. The same applies to artificial systems.

Just as we assess human general intelligence through progressively demanding tests, from basic literacy to PhD examinations, we can consider a cascade of increasingly demanding evidence that warrants progressively higher confidence in the presence of AGI.

Turing-test level. Markers comparable to a basic school education: passing standard school exams, holding adequate conversations and performing simple reasoning. A decade ago, meeting these might have been widely accepted as sufficiently strong evidence for AGI.

Expert level. Here, the demands escalate: gold-medal performance at international competitions, solving problems on PhD exams across multiple fields, writing and debugging complex code, fluency in dozens of languages, useful frontier research assistance as well as competent creative and practical problem-solving, from essay writing to trip planning. These achievements exceed many depictions of AGI in science fiction. The sentient supercomputer HAL 9000, from director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, exhibited less breadth than current LLMs do. And current LLMs even exceed what we demand of humans: we credit individual people with general intelligence on the basis of much weaker evidence.

Superhuman level. Revolutionary scientific discoveries and consistent superiority over leading human experts across a range of domains. Such evidence would surely allow no reasonable debate about the presence of general intelligence in a machine — but it is not required evidence for its presence, because no human shows this.

Current LLMs already cover the first two levels. As LLMs tackle progressively more difficult problems, alternative explanations for their capabilities — for instance, that they are gigantic ‘lookup tables'8 that retrieve pre-computed answers or ‘stochastic parrots'9 that regurgitate shallow regularities without grasping meaning or structure — become increasingly disconfirmed.

Often, however, such claims just reappear with different predictions. Hypotheses that retreat before each new success, always predicting failure just beyond current achievements, are not compelling scientific theories, but a dogmatic commitment to perpetual scepticism.

AI language models killed the Turing test: do we even need a replacement?

AI language models killed the Turing test: do we even need a replacement?

We think the current evidence is clear. By inference to the best explanation — the same reasoning we use in attributing general intelligence to other people — we are observing AGI of a high degree. Machines such as those envisioned by Turing have arrived. Similar arguments have been made before10 (see also go.nature.com/49p6voq), and have engendered controversy and push-back. Our argument benefits from substantial advances and extra time. As of early 2026, the case for AGI is considerably more clear-cut.

We now examine ten common objections to the idea that current LLMs display general intelligence. Several of them echo objections that Turing himself considered in 1950. Each, we suggest, either conflates general intelligence with non-essential aspects of intelligence or applies standards that individual humans fail to meet.

They're just parrots. The stochastic parrot objection says that LLMs merely interpolate training data. They can only recombine patterns they've encountered, so they must fail on genuinely new problems, or ‘out-of-distribution generalization'. This echoes ‘Lady Lovelace's Objection', inspired by Ada Lovelace's 1843 remark and formulated by Turing as the claim that machines can “never do anything really new”1. Early LLMs certainly made mistakes on problems requiring reasoning and generalization beyond surface patterns in training data. But current LLMs can solve new, unpublished maths problems, perform near-optimal in-context statistical inference on scientific data11 and exhibit cross-domain transfer, in that training on code improves general reasoning across non-coding domains12. If critics demand revolutionary discoveries such as Einstein's relativity, they are setting the bar too high, because very few humans make such discoveries either. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that human intelligence is not itself a sophisticated version of a stochastic parrot. All intelligence, human or artificial, must extract structure from correlational data; the question is how deep the extraction goes.

They lack world models. LLMs supposedly lack representations of their physical environment that are necessary for genuine understanding. But having a world model requires only the ability to predict what would happen if circumstances differed — to answer counterfactual questions. Ask a cutting-edge LLM what differs between dropping a glass or a pillow on a tile floor, and it will correctly predict shattering in one case and not the other. The ability of LLMs to solve olympiad mathematics and physics problems and assist with engineering design suggests that they possess functional models of physical principles. By these standards, LLMs already have world models. Furthermore, neural networks developed for specialized domains such as autonomous driving are already learning predictive models of physical scenes that support counterfactual reasoning and sophisticated physical awareness13.

They understand only words. This objection centres on the fact that LLMs are trained only on text, and so must be fundamentally limited to text-based tasks. Frontier models are now trained on images and other multimodal data, making this objection somewhat obsolete. Moreover, language is humanity's most powerful tool for compressing and capturing knowledge about reality. LLMs can extract this compressed knowledge and apply it to distinctly non-linguistic tasks: helping researchers to design experiments — for example, suggesting what to test next in biology and materials science4 — goes beyond merely linguistic performance. We are yet to encounter the sharp limitations to LLM performance that this objection predicts.

They don't have bodies. Without embodiment, critics argue, there can be no general intelligence. This reflects an anthropocentric bias that seems to be wielded only against AI. People would ascribe intelligence to a disembodied alien communicating by radio, or to a brain sustained in a vat. An entity that responds accurately to any question, but never moves or acts physically, would be regarded as profoundly intelligent. Physicist Stephen Hawking interacted with the world almost entirely through text and synthesized speech, yet his physical limitations in no way diminished his intelligence. Motor capabilities are separable from general intelligence.

They lack agency. It is true that present-day LLMs do not form independent goals or initiate action unprompted, as humans do. Even ‘agentic' AI systems — such as frontier coding agents — typically act only when a user triggers a task, even if they can then automatically draft features and fix bugs. But intelligence does not require autonomy. Like the Oracle of Delphi — understood as a system that produces accurate answers only when queried — current LLMs need not initiate goals to count as intelligent. Humans typically have both general intelligence and autonomy, but we should not thereby conclude that one requires the other. Autonomy matters for moral responsibility, but it is not constitutive of intelligence.

The development of micro- and nanorobots has amplified the demand for intelligent multifunctional machines in biomedical applications, but most microrobotic systems struggle to achieve the attributes needed for those applications. Here we introduce enzymatic microbubble robots that exhibit steerable motion, enhanced biodegradability, high in vivo imaging contrast, and effective targeting and penetration of disease sites. These microrobots feature natural protein shells modified with urease to decompose bioavailable urea for autonomous propulsion, whereas an internal microbubble serves as an ultrasound imaging contrast agent for deep tissue imaging and navigation. Magnetic nanoparticle integration enables imaging-guided magnetically controlled motion and catalase functionalization facilitates chemotactic movement towards hydrogen peroxide gradients, directing robots to tumour sites. Focused ultrasound triggers robot shell collapse and inertial cavitation of the released microbubbles, creating mechanical forces that enhance therapeutic payload penetration. In vivo studies validate the tumour-targeting and therapeutic efficacy of these robots, demonstrating enhanced antitumour effects. This multifunctional microbubble robotic platform has the potential to transform medical interventions and precision therapies.

CRISPR–Cas enzymes must recognize a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) to edit a genomic site, greatly limiting the range of targetable sequences in a genome. Although engineering strategies to alter PAM specificity exist, they typically require labor-intensive, iterative experimentation. We introduce an evolution-informed deep learning model, Protein2PAM, to efficiently guide the design of Cas protein variants tailored to recognize specific PAMs. Trained on a dataset of over 45,000 CRISPR–Cas PAMs, Protein2PAM rapidly and accurately predicts PAM specificity directly from Cas proteins across type I, II and V CRISPR–Cas systems. Using in silico mutagenesis, the model identifies residues critical for PAM recognition in Cas9 without using structural information. We use Protein2PAM to computationally evolve Nme1Cas9, generating variants with broadened PAM recognition and up to a 50-fold increase in PAM cleavage rates compared to the wild type in vitro. Our machine learning approach allows Cas enzymes to target sequences that were previously inaccessible because of PAM constraints, potentially increasing target flexibility in personalized genome editing.

The development of large-scale semiconductor quantum circuits is limited by the difficulties involved in efficiently tuning and operating such circuits. Identifying optimal operating conditions for these qubits is, in particular, complex and involves the exploration of vast parameter spaces. Here we report the autonomous tuning of a semiconductor qubit, from a grounded device to Rabi oscillations. Our approach integrates deep learning, Bayesian optimization and computer vision techniques. We demonstrate this automation in a germanium–silicon core–shell nanowire device. To illustrate the potential of full automation, we characterize how the Rabi frequency and g-factor depend on barrier gate voltages for one of the qubits found by the algorithm. We expect our automation algorithm to be applicable to a range of semiconductor qubit devices, allowing for the statistical studies of qubit-quality metrics.

Spin qubits in semiconductor devices could be used to build a universal quantum computer1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Recent work with such systems has demonstrated two-qubit gates with fidelities that surpass the thresholds for fault-tolerant computing4,12,13 and hot qubits that can address the bottleneck of millikelvin refrigeration7,14,15. This has been accompanied by advances in the wafer-scale manufacturing of these devices16,17 as well as their efficient testing at cryogenic temperatures18,19. However, semiconductor quantum circuits are currently limited to 12 qubits in one device16, despite the fact that modern semiconductor fabrication techniques could support the integration of millions of qubits.

A key reason for this limitation is the intricate tuning required to reach and maintain qubit operation. A range of approaches have been explored to automate single stages of this process, including defining double-quantum-dot (DQD) confinement potentials20,21,22,23, navigating to specific charge transitions24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32, fine tuning of charge transport features33 and interdot tunnel couplings34,35, as well as device characterization36,37,38,39,40. These works offer a glimpse into the potential of machine learning for full qubit tuning automation, but the challenge remains.

Here we report a fully autonomous tuning process that can encode a qubit without the need for human intervention. The process of going from a fully de-energized device to the observation of Rabi oscillations, a definitive indicator of qubit functionality, typically takes human experts weeks, or even months, to complete. Our algorithm (Fig. 1), deployed on a DQD device, can complete the tuning process within three days. Our approach integrates deep learning, Bayesian optimization and a computer vision technique, and its success lies in the ability of the algorithm to navigate through various stages of the tuning process, efficiently handling challenges and making accurate decisions.

a, There are four stages that the algorithm needs to successfully navigate to reach qubit operations. The goal of each stage is illustrated with a confinement potential diagram. b, Each stage can either be successful and produce candidates (leading to one or more branches), or unsuccessful (leading to backtracking to the closest stage that still has candidates). The search is, therefore, conducted in a tree structure. Some branches of the tree might be left unexplored. This is indicated by the dashed lines. Inset: illustration of the device. Five different voltages Vi can be applied to a linear confinement. c, A pulsing scheme can be applied with an MW burst of length tburst. The fast line is connected to the plunger gate RP. d, Simulated measurement illustrations that mark the successful transition between stages. Starting from a stability diagram with mere DQD features (far left), the algorithm tunes the parameters until promising bias triangles (middle left), triangles exhibiting PSB (middle right) and finally Rabi oscillations (far right) are obtained. The extremal points of the pulse scheme are indicated as a star and circle in the middle-right illustration.

We use a Ge–Si core–shell nanowire device (Extended Data Fig. 1) in which holes are confined in depletion mode41. The electrical potential is set by a number of gate electrodes. Two plunger gate electrodes predominantly shift the electrochemical potential in the left and right dots with voltages VLP and VRP, respectively. The remaining gate electrodes primarily control the barriers between the DQD and the leads as well as the interdot coupling. One of the plunger gates is connected to a high-frequency line via a bias-tee, allowing for the application of voltage pulses and microwave (MW) bursts.

The device can be probed by applying a bias voltage VSD to the source lead and recording the current ISD at the drain lead. The algorithm navigates to a DQD occupation that exhibits Pauli spin blockade (PSB) for spin-to-charge conversion. To achieve this, the DQD does not need to be depleted to the single-hole regime. The charge occupation on each dot is estimated to be in the range of several dozens42,43,44,45.

The algorithm uses a two-stage pulsing protocol15,46,47,48, which is parameterized by an MW pulse frequency and duration tburst (Fig. 1c). This protocol allows for qubit manipulation if the spin resonance conditions are met. Details on the pulsing scheme for coherent spin control and the device are described in the Methods and another work41.

The autonomous tuning algorithm is structured into four main stages. Starting from a completely de-energized device, that is, with all gate voltages set to 0, the first two stages define the DQD potential by tuning the interdot barrier and the reservoir coupling. The third stage narrows the search space by looking for distinct signatures of PSB, an initialization and read-out requirement. The last stage fine-tunes the plunger voltages and finds the frequency and duration of an MW pulse needed to drive the qubit. The effect of each stage on the DQD confinement potential is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Measurement illustrations exemplifying those taken by the algorithm are shown in Fig. 1d.

As a result of the algorithm design, a search tree emerges (Fig. 1b). Once a stage is successfully completed, a list of candidates is generated. A candidate consists of all the information needed for the next stage to investigate it, usually containing locations or ranges of gate voltages, or information on the suspected g-factor and Rabi frequency fRabi. The candidates are ordered by a dedicated score in each stage and a single candidate is passed onto the next stage. If a stage is unsuccessful, the algorithm backtracks to the previous stage and investigates the next candidate in that stage's list of candidates. This process dynamically creates a search tree (Supplementary Fig. 7 shows examples from real tuning runs). If a different branch has proven to lead to a qubit, some branches of the tree may be left unexplored. These are indicated by dashed lines in the tree in Fig. 1.

We describe each stage in this section. A list of all stages and substages is provided in Extended Data Table 1. More details are provided in Methods and details on the stage structure and composition of candidates for each stage are provided in Supplementary Section 8.

The first stage identifies the gate voltage settings that define the DQD confinement potential. It determines a lower and upper limit for each barrier gate voltage, which is used in subsequent stages.

Building on the methodologies of refs. 21,22, a hypersurface model is created to distinguish between conducting and non-conducting regions within the three-dimensional barrier gate voltage space. The algorithm takes current measurements along random directions within this space (Fig. 2a(i)), and models the hypersurface with a Gaussian process (GP; Fig. 2a(ii)). We expect a DQD potential forming near a corner of the hypersurface in the first octant. To pinpoint this corner, three specific current measurements are conducted using only one of the gate electrodes at a time. The resulting coordinates are then projected onto the model of the hypersurface, setting the lower bounds of the region in which DQDs are likely to be found. The upper bounds of the region are given by the coordinates of the single gate pinch-off voltages, that is, when the current drops to a value that is indistinguishable from the noise floor. The resulting box is labelled as ‘DQD search region' in Fig. 2a(ii).

a, Stage 1: definition of a DQD potential. (i) Current measurements along random directions in the gate voltage space to determine the points at which conducting and non-conducting regions meet—the so-called pinch-off points. (ii) GP model of the hypersurface after collecting sufficient pinch-off points. (iii) A neural network confirms the presence of a DQD analysing the acquired stability diagrams. b, Stage 2: optimization of the bias triangle features. (i) Analysis of stability diagrams, segregating individual transitions and averaging them along segments orthogonal to the detuning axes. (ii) Distribution of optimization scores and averages of bias triangles along segments orthogonal to their detuning axes. We aim to increase the singlet–triplet energy splitting via a proxy score that measures the dip in current between the baselines and the rest of the triangles. (iii) Identification of plunger voltage windows unaffected by charge switches aided by neural networks. c, Stage 3: finding PSB. (i) Initial low-resolution, wide-range detection of PSB using neural networks. (ii) Detailed high-resolution scans using segmentation algorithms. (iii) Bias triangles that show signatures of PSB and can be used to optimize the read-out. d, Stage 4: read-out spot identification within a promising transition. (i) Acquisition of stability diagrams pulsing gate RP to locate the read-out region (indicated by the white dashed box). (ii) Entropy-based scoring of magnetic field traces within the read-out region, optimized through Bayesian methods. (iii) Rabi oscillations for different magnetic fields around the resonance condition to confirm the qubit operation. The measurements marked with ILI were amplified with a lock-in amplifier (Methods).

A methodical search within this box is conducted by the algorithm. The algorithm samples locations in the DQD search region and investigates them, starting from the point nearest to the projected corner and progressing to higher gate voltages. At each location, a one-dimensional trace of the plunger gate voltages is taken and checked for Coulomb peaks, a signature for quantized charge transport and the first requirement for a DQD. If Coulomb peaks are found, a measurement varying both plunger gate voltages (a so-called stability diagram) is acquired and analysed via a neural network for DQD characteristics (Fig. 2a(iii) shows a stability diagram with the desired features). Successful identification of DQD features at a location in the gate voltage space establishes it as a lower limit for the subsequent search.

The goal in the second stage is to adjust the tunnel barriers to enhance the singlet–triplet energy splitting, an important requirement for qubit operation. Additionally, this stage needs to avoid regions of gate voltage space with the following characteristics: regions with high currents above a generous threshold, regions that are susceptible to charge switch noise and regions that show co-tunnelling lines.

Within the gate voltage bounds established in the first stage, Bayesian optimization is used to search for gate voltage combinations. The figure of merit for this optimization is based on the degree to which it reduces current between the triangle baseline and excited states, compared with the current throughout the remaining bias triangles. This acts as an easy-to-compute proxy score of the singlet–triplet energy splitting. The score is further detailed in the ‘Stage 2: tune barriers' section. After Bayesian optimization suggests a voltage setting, a stability diagram is measured (Fig. 2b(i)). We first use a segmentation algorithm49 to find the outlines of individual pairs of bias triangles. The score is then computed using averages of the stability diagram along the common baseline (Fig. 2b(ii)). A neural network identifies bias triangles that are impacted by charge switches. Charge switches distort the stability diagrams and make the area unsuitable for qubit operation (Fig. 2b(iii) (hatched area) and Extended Data Fig. 2). These bias triangles are excluded from optimization. The gate voltage regions explored by optimization are shown in Fig. 2b(ii).

A substantial challenge of this stage is the need for numerous stability diagrams, which are time intensive to measure. To address this, we implement an adaptive, efficient measurement algorithm designed to specifically focus on gate voltage regions in which the bias triangles are present (Supplementary Section 6). Using this method cuts down the measurement time by approximately two-thirds. The optimization is performed using these efficient measurements.

As the final step, stability diagrams without the efficient measurement algorithm are taken in the most promising regions. This is done to ensure that there are no charge switches, because the previous step ranked each location by the highest score of a bias triangle at that location. Therefore, some stability diagrams may have regions affected by charge switches. Bounding boxes are then created in the plunger voltage space, encompassing primarily stable bias triangles with current below the previously mentioned threshold (Fig. 2b(iii)). These triangles are each evaluated and scored, and the bounding boxes are ranked based on the highest score they contain.

Up to this point, the algorithm has only used a positive bias voltage. This stage proposes both positive and negative bias voltages for each candidate it creates. The gate voltage coordinates including the bias voltage are passed onto the subsequent stage.

In the third stage, our algorithm searches for charge transitions exhibiting PSB, a necessary condition for qubit initialization and read-out in this setup. A candidate has to pass three different classifiers to be judged as exhibiting PSB. This is necessary to avoid false positives entering the time-intensive last stage.

We begin with low-resolution stability diagrams of the bias triangle candidates, both with B = 0 T and B = 0.1 T. In these devices, PSB is expressed as a suppressed baseline of the bias triangles in a low magnetic field compared with high magnetic fields (Fig. 2c(iii)). A comparison between the positive and negative bias voltages could also be used at the benefit of removing slow magnetic field sweeps but at the cost of less-reliable signatures.

We use a routine based on the autocorrelation of the stability diagram to pinpoint bias triangle locations (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3). The identified triangles are then analysed using a neural network38(Fig. 2c(i)). Subsequently, the algorithm measures a stability diagram to precisely delineate the bias triangle, followed by high-resolution stability diagrams with B = 0 T and B = 0.1 T.

The algorithm invokes a routine to segment the bias triangles49 (Fig. 2c(ii)). A further PSB classification based on the segmentation is performed. The routine from ref. 49 defines the direction in the plunger voltage space that controls the detuning ε of the dot energies, known as the detuning axis of the bias triangles. Scanning along this line with varying magnetic fields, we expect to observe a current drop at the baseline at zero magnetic field, which another classifier detects (Extended Data Fig. 4). On meeting all criteria, the gate voltage coordinates are forwarded to the next stage.

The final stage of the process is dedicated to finding an operating point for qubit read-out and manipulation. This stage not only identifies a suitable location in the plunger voltage space but also determines the optimal driving frequency and duration of the pulse.

On the basis of the segmentation from the previous stage, a predicted read-out gate voltage region within the bias triangle is defined (Fig. 2d(i)). The algorithm optimizes across the four-dimensional space of the two plunger gate voltages, driving frequencies and pulse durations. It samples a point within this space and then measures the current as a function of the magnetic field (Fig. 2d(ii)). The optimization's goal is to identify a current peak in these scans, indicative of the qubit's resonance condition (Fig. 2d(ii), bottom-right plot). This is achieved by evaluating the entropy of current traces; traces exhibiting a peak correspond to lower entropy values (Methods).

Bayesian optimization then proposes potential candidates for further analysis. These candidates are filtered based on the presence of one or two peaks (corresponding to the number of qubits addressed), as determined by a simple peak-finding algorithm50. Noisy measurements might also show peaks. Therefore, a follow-up step involves retaking the measurement to confirm the presence of a peak.

Once a candidate is verified, several measurements are taken by the algorithm to establish the qubit's operational functionality. These include a spectroscopy measurement; a Rabi chevron experiment (Fig. 2d(iii)), which is used to calibrate the resonance frequency (Extended Data Fig. 5); and repeated high-resolution Rabi oscillations at the Larmor frequency.

Each stage requires a set of hyperparameters. They control various aspects of the measurements such as resolution and safe gate voltage ranges for stability diagrams; aspects of the signal processing algorithms such as the required prominence of peaks; and steering parameters such as the number of candidates that a stage can suggest. The measurement aspects can be derived from some weak prior knowledge about the device, such as the magnitude of lever arms, which informs the resolution of stability diagrams. We also assume a g-factor larger than 0.5 (limiting B and fMW) and fRabi between 30 MHz and 250 MHz (limiting tburst). The requirements on prior knowledge can be easily softened by widening the search space.

The set of hyperparameters influences the length of the runs and the way the algorithm manages trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. Regardless of the hyperparameters, the algorithm will always terminate once all the candidates of each stage have been exhausted.

The choice of hyperparameter was made during development and not optimized for the total run time or efficiency. We provide a full list of all hyperparameters in Supplementary Section 5.

After a qubit has been found, we may choose to study the qubit further. Routines from stages 3 and 4 enable the tracking of a known read-out spot and the resonance condition in the gate voltage space. This allows for recording the dependency of qubit metrics as we change the confinement potential. We provide details of this characterization algorithm in the Methods.

We fixed the hyperparameters and gathered 13 runs. Rabi oscillations were found in ten of those runs. In successful runs, the time spent in each stage varied (Fig. 3a). The total time required ranged from 22 to 80 h, with a mean of 38 h (median, 34 h; Table 1). Each stage relies on the exploration and accuracy of the previous stage. The variation in the time required in each stage gets progressively larger. Almost all time is spent on measuring the device, not on the decision algorithms. This is due to the measurement of current through the DQD, which requires long integration times. A setup that allows for fast measurements via, for example, radio-frequency reflectometry could be tuned orders of magnitudes faster.

a, Duration of each stage for ten successful runs is shown, sorted by the total time taken to tune a qubit in operation. Black: the three runs that did not lead to a qubit. b, Locations in the barrier voltage space (as a fraction of the individual pinch-off voltage) is shown. In some locations, no PSB was identified. The qubit locations are a subset of locations that exhibit PSB. In the failed runs, PSB was found but no Rabi oscillations were observed. c, Examples of transitions from two different runs, showing the associated bias triangles (top row) and Rabi chevrons (bottom row). d, Characterization. By varying the barrier gate voltages, we can build a map of fRabi (top row) and g-factor (bottom row) of one of the found qubits (marked with arrows in b) using automated measurements. For illustrative purposes, we show slices of a GP model that were fitted to the data.

The three failed runs ultimately reached a limit on the explorations it is allowed to make, terminating the search to prevent an unbounded exploration of parameter space. They lasted between 56.0 h and 94.9 h (Fig. 3a, black). Although these runs identified transitions consistent with PSB, the algorithm could not proceed to detect Rabi oscillations. Since the optimal conditions for qubit formation are not uniformly distributed, the algorithm can sometimes converge on parameter regimes in which the tunnel-barrier settings are less optimal. Additionally, when the signal-to-noise ratio is lower, the algorithm may not yield a positive detection.

The qubit locations in the gate voltage space in terms of the three barrier gate voltages are depicted in Fig. 3b. For comparability, we normalize each voltage by the voltage at which each barrier gate electrode pinches off the current individually. At each point, stage 2 (tune barriers) passed a candidate for further analysis (solid dots). In some cases, PSB was detected (dashed circles), passing stage 3, and a subset of these also yielded a qubit (solid circles), successfully completing stage 4. A similar plot showing the distribution in plunger voltage space is provided in Supplementary Section 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2.

Figure 3c presents examples from two runs, showing the transitions found and Rabi chevron measurements. The discovery of qubits in both bias directions evidences the algorithm's adaptability and its non-specificity to certain transitions. Both Rabi chevrons were obtained using the same given driving power and driving frequency, but varied in magnetic fields and Rabi frequencies, highlighting the algorithm's generalization capability. All the depicted measurements were autonomously executed by the algorithm, accounting for the non-centred chevron measurements. Respective measurements for all successful runs are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Analysing the locations in the gate voltage space in which qubits were found provides insight into the device physics (Table 1). By fitting a convex hull around the qubit locations in the barrier gate voltage space, we can estimate the volume of the region in which qubits can be found. For this device, the volume of the convex hull is approximately 3.2 × 10−4 V3, translating to a fraction of the safe ranges ((2 V)3) of about 4 × 10−5. The space is further restricted by the plunger voltage location, which is a box of roughly (10 mV)2. Given a search space of (300 mV)2, this brings down the size of the volume to around 2 × 10−7 as a fraction of the five-dimensional gate voltage space, which is roughly equivalent to a needle in a (2 m)3 haystack.

Once a qubit has been found, the algorithm allows for extensive characterization. We can study fRabi and g-factor as a function of the barrier gate voltages (Fig. 3d). The resulting maps give insights into qubit properties and can be extended to measure, for example, the Hahn-echo coherence time.

We have reported the fully automated tuning of spin qubits, progressing from a de-energized device to qubit control. Our algorithm autonomously achieved Rabi oscillations in 10 out of 13 trials. Most tuning processes concluded within three days, with the primary speed constraint being the integration times required to perform d.c. transport measurements. The times can be sped up via fast read-out alternative or spin manipulation techniques of the quantum device. Maps of the g-factor and fRabi serve as evidence for the potential of this approach for high-throughput qubit characterization.

Our methodology could be extended to other semiconductor-based qubit architectures, including silicon fin field-effect transistors15. The modular design of our algorithm makes adapting to different device layouts and measurement techniques—including charge sensing and single-shot read-out—accessible. Although certain modules and optimization approaches may require refinement to suit larger or more complex devices, our end-to-end approach provides a foundation for future work.

Our autonomous pipeline could also be extended beyond qubit formation towards high-fidelity control. Additional stages can be added that automatically design and refine shaped control pulses, an approach that has already pushed single- and two-qubit fidelities past fault tolerance thresholds when performed manually51,52,53. Coupling such pulse engineering routines with the gate voltage tuning demonstrated here, as well as scaling the full loop to multiqubit architectures, defines the next step for fully self-optimizing spin qubit hardware. Meeting these challenges will be pivotal for realizing hands-free, high-performance quantum processors. More broadly, we expect the internal scores that steer our autonomous loop, such as energy-splitting and entropy measures, may correlate with established qubit-quality benchmarks; systematically mapping those connections, as well as refining the scores accordingly, is a promising direction for future optimization studies.

The mass tuning and characterization of qubits, facilitated by our fully autonomous tuning algorithm, could provide a productive feedback loop between measurement and fabrication processes. Wafer-scale, high-throughput characterization of quantum devices, already feasible in early tuning stages, can mitigate device variability. This, in turn, could improve the tuning process, bolstered by expanding datasets.

Here we provide details of the experimental setup and the algorithmic choices made in this study. We begin by describing the device used for our experiments. We then follow with a discussion of the intelligent computational approaches used in the algorithm. Finally, details of each stage are discussed. An overview of all the stages of the algorithm is given in Extended Data Table 1.

Hyperparameters that are not explicitly given here are provided in Supplementary Section 5.

The device consists of a Ge–Si core–shell nanowire lying on top of nine bottom gates measured in a variable-temperature insert in a liquid-helium bath, with the sample mounted below the 1-K pot (base temperature, 1.5 K). By applying positive voltages to the first five bottom gates from the left, an intrinsic hole gas inside the nanowire is depleted to form a hole DQD. A scanning electron microscopy image of a device similar to the one used here is shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. The device, measurement apparatus and pulse sequence are the same as those used in ref. 41 and are described in detail in that work, which was performed independently and served primarily as an initial reference for the device's characteristics. We did not explicitly encode knowledge of the particular qubit from ref. 41 into our algorithm.

To amplify the measurements that rely on an MW pulse, we applied pulse modulation by a lock-in amplifier at 87.777 Hz. The measurements, therefore, have an in-phase and out-of-phase component. We apply principal component analysis to these measurements and project each measurement onto the principal axis. We further offset the measurements such that they are strictly positive. Measurements that are obtained in this way are marked as ILI, as opposed to currents that were measured conventionally (which are marked as ∣I∣).

Useful automation of tuning from a de-energized device to identify Rabi oscillations requires an algorithm that can adapt to different data-capture regimes, and be transferred to other, similar devices. To achieve this, we have made extensive use of intelligent, adaptive and data-driven subroutines. Nowadays, there is a plethora of such techniques to choose from. To choose the right technique to apply to each stage of the algorithm, we considered the following:

the need for expert-labelled training data, which was not always possible or realistic to source;

the need of being efficient in both total number of measurements taken during a stage and in the resources needed for computing decisions about which measurements to take;

the minimal accuracy needed in each stage for the whole algorithm to be able to achieve its overall goal of identifying operating parameters for a qubit.

To address the above considerations across the many stages of the algorithm, a non-exhaustive list of techniques we have found useful to use includes GP inference, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), unsupervised computer vision and computational geometry techniques, and Bayesian optimization. We now briefly introduce these, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

GPs are a popular form of non-parametric Bayesian inference54. They can be thought of as a method for doing principled Bayesian inference over a space of functions. GPs can be tailored to any specific domain or problem by making a choice of the so-called kernel (or covariance) function, a part of this model that describes prior knowledge about the possible space of functions in which inference is to occur. This choice can allow practitioners to encode important domain knowledge before capturing any data, such as specifying knowledge of periodicities, symmetries or the expected degree of smoothness of the underlying process that is being observed. This constitutes the main strength of GP modelling, often enabling highly data-efficient inference. However, both model fitting and model prediction can be computationally intensive, typically growing cubically54 in the number of observed data points.

Over the past two decades, CNN architectures have proved to be go-to models for solving computer vision tasks. Their strengths lie in their adaptability across different computer vision tasks, their robustness in the face of unknown noise and their computational efficiency at training time. Their weakness lies in always requiring substantial amounts of training data. In this work, we use some standard architectures, such as ResNet55, as tools for extracting properties from or making assessments of stability diagrams. Where we have applied them, training data have been either generated by a sufficiently good simulator or gathered from this or similar devices and then labelled by an expert.

Often, the use of CNNs is neither required nor appropriate for the particular computer vision task at hand. In particular, it has been of crucial importance to a number of stages through the algorithm to be able to automatically locate and segment bias triangles within stability diagrams using a coordinate-wise approach. To achieve this, we have used a number of unsupervised computer vision techniques that can mitigate noise in, and localize features of the geometric figures present in the stability diagrams. Although CNNs would require large amounts of labelled training data to achieve this result, the requirements can be met by computer vision techniques that need no training data, and require only a few hyperparameter choices to be made. All together, we have called this a bias triangle segmentation framework, and it is described in ref. 49, where the specific application to PSB detection is also detailed.

Bayesian optimization21,22,56,57 is a general, iterative approach to black-box function optimization. At each iteration, it constructs a surrogate model of the function being approximated using the data already gathered, and uses this surrogate model to efficiently compute the next most informative location from which to sample the unknown function. To apply this technique, one must specify a score function to optimize and a parameter space over which the search for an optimum is conducted. The choice of the surrogate model is also influential in the accuracy, efficiency and reliability achieved using this method. In this work, we have made consistent use of GP surrogate models using a Matern 5/2 kernel.

(a) Hypersurface building. As the first step, the algorithm determines a current that it considers to be pinched off by ramping to the high end of the safe ranges. We take repeated current measurements there to characterize the noise floor. From the noise floor, we compute a pinch-off current.

Next, we sample several points within the safe ranges using a Sobol sequence for quasi-random locations. The points are used to define rays from the origin that are then investigated for pinch-off. To avoid overloading the current amplifier, we search for pinch-off from the origin towards the upper end of the safety ranges with a low bias voltage. Once the pinch-off is found, we retrace with a higher bias voltage to confirm the exact pinch-off location.

Finally, we use these data to construct the hypersurface model, as outlined in the main text.

(b) Double-dot detection. The previous stage defines a region within which we can look for a DQD potential. We sample quasi-random points via a Sobol sequence for investigation. For each point, we vary both plunger voltages simultaneously and measure the current, following the method described in ref. 21. We use the random forest classifier developed in ref. 22 to check for the presence of Coulomb peaks. If Coulomb peaks are found, we then measure a stability diagram. This diagram is analysed with a neural network to detect features of the DQD. The neural network was trained on data from a variety of devices, mainly from the data gathered in refs. 21,22, and additional data are obtained from a nanowire device different from the one used in this work. In total, there were 4,611 stability diagrams, out of which 726 showed double-dot features.

(a) Barrier optimization. On the formation of separated pairs of bias triangles, we perform coordinate-wise segmentation and polygon fitting49 to facilitate their tracking and feature extraction throughout the remainder of the tuning pipeline.

Segmentation and shape extraction enable the assessment of the current intensity difference between the baseline and gap formed between the base and first excited-state line. By quantifying this intensity difference in a base separation score, we can use a Bayesian optimization framework, which seeks to maximize the intensity difference, as a promising indicator for detecting viable candidates for PSB.

Each pair of bias triangles should present a base well separated from the main body. By measuring the d.c. current through the device, we effectively probe the internal energy transitions between the two quantum dots. Crucially, these transitions remain relatively unaffected by the thermal broadening of the leads, making the scheme viable at higher (‘hot') temperatures. For PSB-based read-out to be effective, the energy splitting between the relevant singlet and triplet states, that is, ΔST, must exceed the thermal energy (kBT). Once ΔST ≤ kBT, the PSB mechanism can degrade and allow unwanted leakage current, thereby compromising the quality of the read-out. The energy-splitting score, therefore, serves as a metric to guide the algorithm towards bias triangles that are more likely to yield robust spin read-out and, ultimately, stable qubit operation. Supplementary Section 3 provides further discussion on the relation of this score with spin-state visibility. Supplementary Section 4 provides empirical justification of the score.

The separation score is computed by averaging the current along the detuning axis (Fig. 2b(ii) shows two one-dimensional traces), and computing the ratio of the intensity between the peaks and the lowest point in the valley between them. In the case of multiple triangles, the highest separation is used as the score.

Certain potential landscapes can lead to situations in which charge configurations are affected by charge switch noise. Since these potentials are unlikely to be used as a qubit and the resulting bias triangles can skew our base separation scoring, we excluded them by leveraging a neural network classifier. This classifier was trained to distinguish between normal bias triangles and the ones that are affected by charge switch noise (Extended Data Fig. 2). The training dataset for this classifier was obtained as follows: initially, potential bias triangles were identified using our segmentation routine. Subsequently, we manually labelled 2,302 of these (1,539 samples showed no switch noise) to create a robust training set. The classifier itself was then obtained by fine-tuning a ResNet-based architecture with this dataset.

Once the voltage space has been explored through Bayesian optimization, we have a clear understanding of the landscape (Fig. 2b(ii)). The measurements in this optimization were obtained using an efficient measurement algorithm (Supplementary Section 6). We sample the most promising regions again without the efficient measurement algorithm and analyse them, as described in the next section.

(b) Plunger window selection. Given a sampled stability diagram containing bias triangles, the aim is to select the region that contains as many bias triangles with scores as high as possible, no areas with current that is too high and as few switches as possible (Fig. 2b(iii)). High-current bias triangles are unlikely to be able to be used for qubit operations. This is a heuristic and we set a conservative threshold of 200 pA. To ease the downstream steps, the region should be a rectangular window. Through an iterative approach, starting from the smallest bounding boxes containing each single pair of bias triangles, larger windows are constructed by merging the existing ones in case they satisfy the conditions about switch absence and low currents. For the absence of switches, we used a soft constraint, allowing for bias triangles affected by switch noise in case their total area was less than 25% of the area covered by all triangles in the window. The algorithm complexity scales exponentially with respect to the number of triangles and some heuristics have been leveraged to reduce substantially complexity and, therefore, execution time. In particular, at each iteration, only the top 100 bounding boxes by the number of contained triangles without switches were kept, to ensure a manageable upper limit on the number of possible merges. The routine halts when no further merges are possible. Once the plunger windows have been selected, they are ranked by the highest separation score.

(a) Wide-shot PSB detection. To identify each bias triangle's location, we first leverage the fact that they sit on a honeycomb or skewed rectangle pattern. We use autocorrelation on the stability diagram to identify this pattern. The largest two peaks in the autocorrelation help us establish a vector that spans this pattern of skewed rectangles. To fix the pattern in place, we use a blob detection algorithm, using the first blob it identifies. This helps us accurately overlay the skewed rectangle pattern and estimate the locations of the bias triangles (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Next, we extract these bias triangles using the identified locations, with side lengths informed by the pattern dimensions. These extracted bias triangles are then input into a neural network for further analysis. We used autonomously gathered data that were taken during the initial development phase. In total, we used 626 pairs of bias triangles taken from 70 stability diagrams. Here 55 pairs of bias triangles showed PSB. Reference 38 provides more detailed information on this procedure.

(b) Re-centring and high-resolution PSB detection. In an effort to filter the previously detected candidates for PSB and eliminate false positives, a second set of higher-resolution measurements is performed. For that purpose, a dedicated low-resolution stability diagram of the candidate bias triangles is taken and used to update the plunger voltage extent based on the detected contours, effectively performing a re-centring. With the updated voltage extent, high-resolution stability diagrams with B = 0 T and with B = 0.1 T are taken.

A second substage of PSB classification is applied through a segmentation-based detection and feature extraction framework, which facilitates the coordinate-wise quantification of geometric and physical properties of bias triangles49. In particular, given the high-resolution stability diagram with B = 0.1 T, this framework fits minimum-edge polygons to the detected contours of bias triangle pairs by utilizing a relaxed extension of the Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm49. Once the segmented shape mask is identified, further geometric properties such as the base and excited-state lines can be automatically extracted solely based on prior knowledge of the bias voltage sign, which predicts the direction in which the bias triangles point.

For the identification of PSB, an analytical classifier based on the above framework was devised49. PSB expresses itself as a suppressed baseline of the bias triangles at B = 0 T. At B > 0 T, there is a leakage current at the baseline. The routine extracts the segment enclosing the base and a prominent excited-state line on the stability diagram with a leakage current (B = 0.1 T). Subsequently, the average pixel intensity of the segment normalized by the intensity of the entire pair of bias triangles is computed. By superimposing the detected segment on the scan with blocked current (B = 0 T), normalized intensity values are compared and, if their difference exceeds a specified threshold, the charge transition is identified as positive for PSB.

On the basis of the segmented shape mask of the bias triangle, further geometrical properties can be automatically extracted, which enables the tuning of bias triangle features in stage 2. The detuning axis, utilized for the Danon gap measurement, is automatically extracted by identifying the bias triangles' base midpoints and tips and computing the lines between them.

(c) Danon gap check. As a further filter for possible candidates, we check to find the magnetic field dependence of the leakage current at the base of the bias triangles in a different way. As a function of the applied magnetic field B, we expect the leakage current to be minimal at B = 0 T and higher away from this point. We call this the Danon gap58. A current measurement of the detuning line as the magnetic field is varied, giving us a two-dimensional input (Extended Data Fig. 4), which we can analyse as follows. Ignoring the noise signal, the current is roughly constant along the magnetic field axis, whereas the detuning line axis is information rich. Away from the Danon gap, there are two local extrema (to one side, the noise floor outside the bias triangles, and to the other side, the gap due to singlet–triplet energy splitting), whereas the Danon gap region is characterized by a monotonic behaviour, with roughly a constant value.

To detect the presence of the Danon gap, the current I is first processed with a Gaussian filter, to smooth out the noise, and then the absolute slopes along the detuning line axis are integrated: \(g(B):={\sum }_{\varepsilon }\left|\frac{\partial \widetilde{I}(\varepsilon ,B)}{\partial \varepsilon }\right|\), where the derivative is the discrete derivative along the detuning line axis. The function g is minimized in the areas where the smoothed signal \(\widetilde{I}\) shows a constant value. We show the normalized function \({\bar{g}} =\frac{g}{| \varepsilon | }\) in Extended Data Fig. 4. To detect the presence of the Danon gap from g, two tunable hyperparameters are used, validating the depth and width of the basin of the global minimum of g: in case the basin is not prominent enough, there is no Danon gap. As the last check, the location of the minima has to be in proximity of zero magnetic field.

(a) Tracking and entropy optimization. In the subsequent steps, we apply a pulse sequence to the right plunger electrode. As it is a two-stage pulse, the bias triangles will have a ‘shadow' in the stability diagram. We need to identify the original bias triangles and find a suitable region in which we can expect to find qubit read-out. In light of the resulting shape distortions and further degrading effects to the measurement quality, we opt for template matching as opposed to performing re-segmentation for bias triangle tracking to ensure robustness.

The relative direction in which the shadow bias triangles appear with respect to the original one is known in advance due to the applied pulse shape. This is incorporated into the shape-matching approach as the cardinal direction to uniquely identify and track the triangles. We perform shape matching by comparing the edge map of a stability diagram before pulsing, functioning as the template, to the edge map of a subsequent stability diagram with pulsing, functioning as the source for current information. Further, we extract the segmented shape mask from the template. The method slides the template over the source edge map, thereby comparing the template with individual patches of the stability diagram with pulsing, and returns a result matrix (of the same size as the source) whose individual entries quantify the similarity with the template patch. The used similarity metric is the normalized correlation coefficient, and the patch with the maximum correlation is selected. Once the appropriate patch has been identified, the initial segmentation mask of the stability diagram without pulsing is mapped to the stability diagram with pulsing and used for subsequent processing.

To identify the optimal read-out spot, we extract the segment enclosing the base and prominent excited-state lines on the obtained segmented mask of bias triangles with pulsing. We then perform Bayesian optimization of a read-out quality score over the following parameters: the constrained two-dimensional plunger gate voltage space, frequency of the driving pulse fMW and burst time tburst.

Optimal read-out candidates are those that meet the resonance conditions of the qubit. If they are met, there is a leakage current that we record using the lock-in amplifier. For a given burst time tburst (relating to the Rabi frequency fRabi) and a given frequency of the driving pulse fMW (relating to the g-factor), the leakage is characterized as a peak in leakage current for a certain magnetic field B. In this setup, hardware-related resonances and non-uniform attenuation across certain frequency ranges introduce distortions when the drive frequency is varied instead of the magnetic field. Consequently, sweeping the magnetic field at a fixed frequency provides a more stable and interpretable signal, even though it is slower. Thus, for read-out optimization, we measure the current with varying magnetic fields. Instead of applying principal component analysis, as explained above, we use the L2 norm of the in-phase and out-of-phase components to retrieve a one-dimensional trace l(B). This guarantees peaks to be higher than the background, as opposed to processing with principal component analysis, which can lead to dips rather than peaks.

To quantify the sharpness of these peaks, we developed a score based on the Shannon entropy \(H=-{\sum }_{B}\left[l(B)\log [l(B)]\right]\) of the trace. For the calculation of the entropy of the score, we first subtract the median and then clip values at zero. This particular preprocessing turns the trace into something more akin to a distribution and enhances the robustness of our score, making it less susceptible to potential noise disturbances in the trace. This method results in a smooth score landscape suitable for Bayesian optimization.

(b) Resonance confirmation. This verification step acts as a final filter and all the last stages are executed once a candidate passes this filter. The previous stage sends a candidate with a suspected resonance condition. The stage re-measures the leakage current as a function of the magnetic field. If the resonance condition was truly found, a peak should appear at the same magnetic field again. If we detect a peak with a specified prominence at this magnetic field within a set margin of error, the resonance condition is considered confirmed and all downstream measurements are executed. We note that a noisy candidate might pass this stage. Repeating the verification step can reduce such occurrences.

(c) Qubit measurements. Once a resonance condition is found, we vary the magnetic field and burst duration. The characteristic Rabi chevron can be analysed by considering the frequency spectrum for each magnetic field. The frequency should have a minimum at the magnetic field that meets the resonance condition of the qubit. The amplitude should also be the maximum there due to decoherence for off-resonant driving. We can, therefore, simply look for the maximum amplitude in the Fourier-transformed Rabi chevron (Extended Data Fig. 5). This information will give us the precise resonance conditions for the last step, which are repeated measurements of Rabi oscillations on resonance.

The maps shown in Fig. 3 were generated using automated measurements. Initially, on identifying a qubit, we record its read-out spot, g-factor and fRabi. We then alter the confinement potential by slightly adjusting the barrier gate voltages. This adjustment may shift the bias triangles, consequently moving the read-out spot, g-factor and fRabi. Our method involves tracing these transitions to locate the read-out spot in its new position. At this new location, we conduct an electric dipole spin resonance check scan. Any changes in the peak's location inform us about variations in the g-factor. Furthermore, measuring Rabi oscillations at this point helps update our understanding of fRabi.

As we progressively deviate from the initial measurement point, we utilize our closest prior qubit data to infer the properties at the new location. This step is crucial as a shift in the g-factor necessitates modifying the magnetic field range, whereas a change in fRabi requires adjusting the tburst duration for the electric dipole spin resonance check to accurately detect resonances.

The measurement is analysed by first computing the averaged sum of absolute derivatives \({\bar{g}}\) (right). If a dip is present in \({\bar{g}}\) close to B = 0 T, PSB is confirmed.

A qubit that is driven close to the resonance condition exhibits so-called Rabi chevrons, see left column for examples (top: simulation, bottom: experimental data). To find the resonance frequency, we analyse the frequency spectrum for each magnetic field (which controls the detuning from resonance). The frequencies have a maximum amplitude and a minimal point at the resonance condition.

Metrics details

CTNNB1, the gene encoding β-catenin, is a frequent target for oncogenic mutations activating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, typically through missense mutations within a degron hotspot motif in exon 3. Here, we combine saturation genome editing with a fluorescent reporter assay to quantify signaling phenotypes for all 342 possible missense mutations in the mutation hotspot. Our data define the genetic requirements for β-catenin degron function, refine the consensus motif for substrate recognition by β-TRCP and reveal diverse levels of signal activation among known driver mutations. Tumorigenesis in different human tissues involves selection for CTNNB1 mutations spanning distinct ranges of predicted activity. In hepatocellular carcinoma, mutation effect scores distinguish two tumor subclasses with different levels of β-catenin signaling, and weaker mutations predict greater immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. Our work provides a resource to understand mutational diversity within a pan-cancer mutation hotspot, with potential implications for targeted therapy.

The canonical Wnt pathway is essential for normal development and is erroneously activated in many cancers1. Its main intracellular effector, β-catenin (encoded by CTNNB1), is normally degraded by a destruction complex consisting of APC, AXIN2, CK1 and GSK3β. Wnt ligand binding or mutations that impair this complex lead to β-catenin accumulation, nuclear translocation and activation of T cell Factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF) transcription factor target genes (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) serves as a scaffold within the destruction complex. APC loss-of-function mutations activate β-catenin and are common in colorectal cancers, in which tumors often select for mutations with a ‘just-right' level of β-catenin signaling2,3,4,5.

Gain-of-function changes within the CTNNB1 exon 3 degron motif are among the most common mutations in several tumor types6,7. These mutations act in a dominant manner by disrupting the interaction between the phosphorylated DpSGXXpS motif (residues 32–37) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase receptor β-TRCP, preventing β-catenin ubiquitylation and degradation7. The phospho-regulatory cascade involves CK1 priming at S45, followed by GSK3β phosphorylation at T41, S37 and S33, enabling β-TRCP docking.

Mutations within exon 3 of CTNNB1 occur in 20–30% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)8,9. HCC has been classified into subtypes with distinct molecular and immune features10,11,12,13. The inflamed class is characterized by interferon signaling, enrichment of cytolytic T cells and M1 macrophages, whereas the non-inflamed class is largely devoid of immune infiltrate. β-catenin signaling and CTNNB1 mutations are associated with immune exclusion and promote resistance to immunotherapy in mouse models of HCC9,14,15,16. However, a substantial fraction of CTNNB1-mutant HCCs presents an inflamed phenotype (30%), highlighting the need for studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms14.

Previous studies have suggested that different CTNNB1 mutations can activate signaling to different degrees17,18,19. A small subset of exon 3 genotypes observed in human cancer has been directly compared using cellular assays; however, the functional impact of most variants remains unknown. Here, we develop a saturation genome editing (SGE) assay to systemically quantify the relative activity of all possible missense substitutions within the exon 3 hotspot, assigning functional scores to >80% of CTNNB1 missense mutations observed in cancer.

We analyzed 9,248 tumors with CTNNB1 mutations in the COSMIC database (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). As previously reported6, the majority of mutations (86%) were missense substitutions. Of these, 88% occurred in the L31–G48 hotspot region encoded by exon 3 (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). Residues T41 and S45 were most frequently affected, comprising 27% and 25% of hotspot missense mutations, respectively, followed by S37, S33, D32 and G34 (Supplementary Fig. 1b).

Phosphorylation sites known to be critical for β-catenin turnover are highlighted in red boxes. c, Histograms show distinct distributions of mutations within the CTNNB1 mutation hotspot for COSMIC tumors of the adrenal gland, central nervous system (CNS) and skin. Data from other primary tissue sites are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. d, Schematic overview of the mutational scanning assay. A β-catenin signaling activity reporter construct was integrated randomly into the genome to generate transgenic mice23. Primary ES cells were derived, and a region spanning exons 2–6 of Ctnnb1 was replaced with a puro∆TK selection cassette on one of two alleles. A plasmid library was generated for homology-directed repair, encoding each of 342 possible single amino acid substitutions spanning codons 31 to 48 of β-catenin, together with silent mutations to allow selective PCR amplification of edited alleles from genomic DNA. This was transfected into multiplex-ready mouse ES cells together with sgRNAs that cut in an allele-specific manner on either side of the selection cassette. After recovery, transfected cells were cultured in the presence of FIAU to kill those in which the selection cassette had not been removed. Multiplex-ready cells were routinely cultured under 2i conditions51 to compensate for hemizygous CTNNB1 expression, but the GSK3β inhibitor (CHIR99021) was withdrawn 2 days before sorting to allow β-catenin signaling to return to a baseline state. Cells were then subject to fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on the level of GFP reporter expression, before extraction of genomic DNA, amplification of Ctnnb1 exon 3 by PCR and Illumina sequencing. Further methodological information is detailed in the Methods. e, The frequency of individual missense mutations across each position in the mutation hotspot in cell populations sorted according to the scheme shown in d, expressed relative to their frequency in the unsorted pool sample. The color scheme used to represent different missense mutations is shown to the right.

Source data

Analysis across tissues revealed tissue-specific mutation preferences (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). S45 mutations are greatly enriched in adrenal and kidney tumors, whereas mutations within the β-TCRP docking motif predominated in the central nervous system (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). Liver and skin showed a broader profile, encompassing all six of the most frequently mutated positions (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). Specific amino acid substitutions at each residue also varied by tissue. For example, 99% of soft tissue tumors with T41 mutations (1,201 out of 1,217) carried T41A, whereas in pituitary gland, 89% of T41 mutations (77 out of 87) were T41I (Supplementary Fig. 2). Overall, CTNNB1 hotspot mutational patterns are highly diverse and tissue-dependent.

To systematically measure the consequences of CTNNB1 hotspot mutations on β-catenin signaling, we devised a multiplexed CRISPR homology-directed repair (HDR) assay covering all 342 possible single amino acid substitutions across positions 31–48 (Fig. 1d). This assay enables phenotypic analysis of variants expressed from the endogenous mouse Ctnnb1 locus, which is 100% conserved with human exon 3 at the amino acid level. Variant function was measured in parallel under normal regulatory control20,21,22, providing a sensitive and comprehensive assessment of hotspot mutant phenotypes. A library of HDR templates was synthesized, each encoding a single amino acid substitution and flanking synonymous changes to enable selective PCR amplification of edited alleles20,21 (Fig. 1d).

To analyze individual hotspot mutations at the single-cell level, we derived embryonic stem (ES) cells from the Tcf/Lef-H2B–GFP transgenic mouse line23,24, then replaced exons 2–6 of Ctnnb1 with a negative counter-selection cassette on one allele (Fig. 1d). Specifically targeting and replacing the selection cassette with a multiplexed HDR template library, combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Supplementary Fig. 3a), enabled efficient quantification of the functional output of each edited allele (Fig. 1d). ES cells were chosen for their high HDR efficiency and intact canonical WNT signaling, in contrast to most tumor lines.

After editing and selection, a subset of cells displayed elevated Tcf/Lef-H2B–GFP reporter expression (Supplementary Fig. 3a), consistent with canonical Wnt pathway activation. Cells were sorted into six equally log-spaced bins (P1–P6) based on increasing reporter GFP signal (Supplementary Fig. 3a), and genomic DNA was subjected to amplicon deep sequencing across the Ctnnb1 hotspot region using primers specific for HDR-edited alleles (Fig. 1d). Amplicon sequencing was also performed on the untransfected HDR donor library (‘plasmid') and edited but unsorted cells (‘pool'; Supplementary Fig. 3b), enabling quantification of Ctnnb1 variant frequencies across reporter activity bins relative to their frequency in the total cell population (Fig. 1e). Normalized mutant allele frequencies showed high correlations between biological replicates (Pearson's r, range 0.54–0.89; Supplementary Fig. 3c) and were merged for downstream analysis. Frequencies also correlated well between plasmid and pool samples (Pearson's r, 0.63), indicating consistent and unbiased HDR efficiency throughout the targeted region (Supplementary Fig. 3c).

The mutation frequency was relatively constant across positions in the unsorted cell population (Supplementary Fig. 3b), whereas it varied substantially across cells with different GFP levels (Fig. 1e). Substitutions at codon positions that are frequently mutated in tumors (D32, S33, G34, S37, T41 and S45) were rarely observed in low activity bins but frequently observed in bins of higher activity (Fig. 1e), validating this system's ability to functionally classify CTNNB1 mutations.

For each variant, we calculated a mutational effect score (MES) by integrating allele frequencies and reporter activation levels across bins25 (Supplementary Methods). This procedure provided a metric to compare the phenotypic consequences of each substitution and gain insight into β-catenin regulation (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2).

Created in BioRender.com. c, Unsupervised clustering of Ctnnb-mutant clones based on global RNA-seq expression profiling shows co-clustering of clones with mutations of similar MES values (purple bar). d,e, Ten endogenous β-catenin target genes were selected based on the high correlation (>0.85) between transcript expression and dose of the GSK3β inhibitor CHIR99021 (d); transcript expression also correlated with MES values of the relevant exon 3 mutations (e). All r values and P values are from Pearson tests (two-sided); P values of <0.05 are highlighted in red.

Source data

We first compared the MES values with scores produced by 50 computational variant effect predictors (VEPs) for the same substitutions26 (Supplementary Table 3). The strongest correlation was observed for EVE, which uses deep generative models to calculate variant effect scores from evolutionary sequence information27. The correlation between EVE and MES scores for the CTNNB1 hotspot (Spearman's ρ, 0.662) was higher than any other EVE–deep mutational scanning (DMS) combination and all but three of 1,430 VEP–DMS comparisons in a prior benchmarking study26. Although correlation with VEP scores is not a definitive measure of DMS reliability, the strong concordance supports the high quality of the current dataset.

We next tested the ability of MES scores to predict endogenous β-catenin target activation. Using multiplex-ready ES cells, we generated 15 clonal cell lines (Fig. 2b), each heterozygous for one of 11 mutations spanning a range of MES values, focusing on substitutions at the three most frequently mutated positions in human cancer. Transcriptional responses were measured using bulk 3′ RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), with GSK3β inhibition by CHIR99021 serving as a positive control. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering classified cell lines into low, medium and high MES categories (Fig. 2c). Ten β-catenin targets that showed dose-responsive activation by CHIR99021 (Pearson r > 0.85; Fig. 2d) also displayed positive correlations between transcript levels and the relevant MES value (Fig. 2e; median Pearson r = 0.57; range, 0.02–0.87; P < 0.05 for seven out of ten target genes).

MES values also predicted endogenous β-catenin target gene expression in human fetal liver organoids. A previous study introduced one of four exon 3 mutations (D32G, S33F, T41A or S45P) homozygously at the endogenous CTNNB1 locus (Supplementary Fig. 4a)28. RNA-seq data from these organoids showed positive correlations between MES values and β-catenin target genes in nine out of ten cases (median Pearson r = 0.65; range, −0.5 to 0.96; Supplementary Fig. 4b). As outlined further below, MES scores also predicted the strength of β-catenin target activation in two independent human HCC cohorts. Altogether, these data show that MES values predict the degree to which endogenous β-catenin target genes are activated by different exon 3 mutations in both mouse ES cells and hepatocytes.

The current model of genotype–phenotype relationships within the exon 3 hotspot proposes that missense mutations exert position-dependent effects on β-catenin signaling: S45 mutations activate weakly, T41 mutations activate moderately and mutations within the core β-TRCP docking motif (positions 32–37) activate strongly19. Our derivation of MES values for all 19 possible missense mutations across the hotspot region enabled testing and refinement of this model. Notably, of the 342 possible amino acid changes, only 105 can arise by a single nucleotide substitution (median of six changes per site; Fig. 3a). As expected, this group accounts for >98% of the single amino acid substitutions in the COSMIC database (Supplementary Table 1).

Source data

Consistent with the current model, we found that S45 mutations generally produced weaker activation than mutations in the docking motif, both among single-nucleotide variants and across all substitutions (Fig. 3b). Nonetheless, MES values at the same position varied substantially (Fig. 3a,c). For example, S45T and T41S were well tolerated (Fig. 3c), reflecting the ability of CK1α and GSK3β to phosphorylate either serine or threonine29. Substitution of S45 for small amino acids (alanine, glycine) was also well tolerated (Fig. 2a). It has previously been reported that in-frame deletions at S45 still permit phosphorylation at T41, S37 and S33 in colon cancer cells30,31. Collectively, the data thus suggest that the absence of a large side chain at S45 enables β-catenin degron function without CK1α priming32.

Although the average effect of all T41 substitutions was intermediate, >98% in the COSMIC database are substitutions for alanine or isoleucine, which were the two strongest activating substitutions identified at this position. Both substitutions can be reached by one nucleotide change (Fig. 3c). This contrasts with S45, for which all eight strongest amino acid substitutions require at least two nucleotide changes (Fig. 3c). Therefore, strong activating S45 mutations are theoretically possible (for example, S45M, S45K) but are rarely observed in cancer, probably because they require at least two nucleotide changes.

Extending the current model19, our data show that T41A and T41I activate β-catenin more than many commonly observed docking-motif variants (for example, D32V, D32Y, D32H, S33P, G34R). Other mutations at T41 (T41N, T41P), which are rare but still recurrent in human cancer (Supplementary Table 1), elicit weaker activation in the lower range of S45 mutations. It is therefore evident that different substitutions at the same position can elicit markedly different effects on β-catenin signaling, refining our understanding of CTNNB1 mutational diversity.

I35 lies at the center of the docking motif, directly contacting β-TRCP, and is thought to require a hydrophobic amino acid side chain6,33. The I35 side chain projects into a cavity on the β-TRCP surface33 (Fig. 3d). MES values for I35 substitutions were broadly distributed (Figs. 2a and 3a) and negatively correlated with a hydrophobicity index at this position34 (Spearman ρ = −0.42; Fig. 3e). However, substitution of isoleucine for several polar amino acids (for example, threonine, asparagine, tyrosine) yielded low MES values (Fig. 2a), indicating that hydrophobicity is not essential. By screening 566 amino acid property indices35, we observed that the strongest correlations with I35 MES values were nearly all related to secondary structure propensities. A Spearman correlation of −0.79 was observed with the ‘normalized frequency of β-sheet' index36 (Fig. 3f). Although residue I35 does not form a β-sheet in any available crystal structure, its dihedral angles place it clearly in the β region of a Ramachandran plot.

To ask whether this secondary structure requirement extended to other β-TRCP docking sites, we analyzed 28 high-confidence β-TRCP-dependent degrons containing the ‘DSGX' motif37 (Supplementary Table 4). Position 4 residues in this motif (corresponding to I35 in β-catenin) were variable across substrates (Fig. 3g). Numerous substrates (eight out of 28) had position 4 amino acids that ranked in the 25% most disruptive on the hydrophobicity scale, whereas only one out of 28 featured in the same bracket of the β-sheet scale (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0248). Therefore, an extended backbone conformation, rather than side chain hydrophobicity, better explains the effects of I35 substitutions and potentially analogous positions in other β-TRCP docking motifs.

The frequency of CTNNB1 hotspot mutations varies across tumor types (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1), probably reflecting multiple contributing factors. Stem cells in different tissues experience different genotoxic insults, which affect overall mutational spectra38,39 as well as the probability that specific CTNNB1 missense mutations become available for selection. Alternatively, or in addition, different tissue environments might favor selection for missense mutations causing levels of activation that are optimal, or ‘just-right', for their spatio-temporal context2. The current data provide an opportunity to distinguish these possibilities.

Mutational probability, calculated from background nucleotide substitution rates, is a poor predictor of CTNNB1 mutation patterns in cancer40, suggesting a strong influence of selection. We computed ‘mutational likelihood scores' (MLSs) for each of 342 hotspot missense mutations, using the background rates of nucleotide substitution in HCC and endometrial carcinoma whole-exome sequencing data (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). These scores represent the probability of an amino acid substitution, given the dominant mutational biases seen genome-wide in coding sequences of CTNNB1-mutant tumors. MLS values correlated positively across tissues (Pearson r = 0.920 for all mutations, r = 0.655 for the single-nucleotide group; Fig. 4a) but did not predict observed mutation frequencies (Fig. 4b; negative binomial generalized linear model, no improvement over null model; PLRT = 0.77 and 0.60, respectively). Therefore, tissue-specific CTNNB1 mutation patterns cannot be explained solely by mutation rates.

Scores are shown for all 342 possible amino acid changes, colored according to the minimum number of nucleotide substitutions required. b, Relationship between the observed frequency of specific CTNNB1 hotspot amino acid substitutions in the COSMIC database and MLSs calculated from LIHC and UCEC exomes from TCGA (see Supplementary Fig. 5).

We next tested whether tumors arising in different tissues select for hotspot mutations that activate β-catenin signaling to different degrees. Mutations in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) endometrial carcinoma cohort (Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma, UCEC) were enriched for higher MES values (Mann–Whitney test, P = 2.2 × 10−5), whereas in TCGA HCC cohort (Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma, LIHC), mutations spanned a broader range (Fig. 4c). This difference persisted following adjustment for tissue-specific background rates of mutation within coding sequences (P = 3.2 × 10−5). Given that mutation bias does not explain the tissue-specific difference in observed mutation frequencies, we postulate that they arise through natural selection for different optimal β-catenin signaling2.

Even greater variation in MES values was observed in the larger COSMIC dataset (Supplementary Table 1) across CTNNB1-mutant tumors from diverse tissue origins (Fig. 4d; one-way ANOVA, P < 2 × 10−19). Using MES distributions, tissues could be categorized as favoring high-effect mutations (for example, central nervous system), low-effect mutations (for example, kidney) or a broad or bimodal distribution (Fig. 4c). Bimodal distributions, observed in tissues such as large intestine and liver, comprised a lower-effect group, with mutations at S45 and weaker mutations within the β-TRCP docking motif (for example, H36P, D32Y, S33P), and a higher-effect group containing S33, G34, S37 and T41 mutations. These distributions highlight the potential for phenotypic variation arising from different CTNNB1 mutations among tumors with the same site of origin.

To investigate how CTNNB1 mutation strength influences signaling and immune exclusion in human cancer, we focused on HCC, which shows frequent exon 3 mutations. Patients with single exon 3 missense mutations and available RNA-seq data in TCGA HCC cohort8 (n = 80) were initially stratified into low and high groups based solely on the MES value of their mutation (Supplementary Fig. 6a). However, copy number gains spanning CTNNB1 enhance signaling, especially for S45 mutant alleles19, so six patients with copy number gains spanning mutant alleles in the low MES group were reassigned (Supplementary Fig. 6b). This produced 53 patients predicted to have strong and 27 with predicted weak β-catenin pathway activation (Fig. 5a and Supplemental Fig. 6b). For patients in the weak group, 48% had mutations in the docking motif, compared to 77% of the strong group (P = 0.012; Fig. 5b)

a, Proportion of HCC samples from TCGA cohort with CTNNB1 missense or AXIN1 coding mutations (left). The CTNNB1 missense mutations are then further divided into three categories (right): strong and weak mutations within the exon 3 hotspot (Supplementary Fig. 6b) and mutations that occurred elsewhere in the gene (other). A total of 18 further samples fell into more than one category or had deletions within CTNNB1; therefore, they were excluded. TCGA sample IDs and classifications are listed in Supplementary Table 9. b, Stacked histograms show the frequency and proportion of CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations from TCGA HCC cohort classified as weak or strong that lie in the docking site for β-TRCP (positions 32–37) versus elsewhere in the mutation hotspot. P value shows Fisher's exact test (two-sided). c, Expression of n = 10 β-catenin target genes in HCC stratified by β-catenin pathway mutation status. For each gene, the median expression value was calculated across all samples in the indicated patient group, then expressed as a percentage of the median value for the same gene in the strong group (indicated by the dashed horizontal line at 100%). FPKM, fragments per kilobase per million. Solid horizontal lines show the median percentage value across all ten genes, boxes show the upper and lower quartiles and whiskers show the range. *P < 4 × 10−3, **P < 1 × 10−4 from negative binomial generalized linear model (two-sided), with Tukey's adjustment for a family of five estimates. Gene-level data are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7a. d, Heatmap representation of β-catenin pathway activation for TCGA HCC samples with exon 3 hotspot mutations separated into weak and strong categories. LGR5 and GLUL are individual HCC targets. ‘Hallmark' indicates a multi-gene score calculated across 42 genes known to be activated by the accumulation of β-catenin (Hallmark wnt_b-Catenin gene set, MSigDB). P values show one-tailed t-tests. e, Boxplots show Hallmark β-catenin target gene set activation in TCGA tumors with strong or weak mutations in the docking motif, compared to those with mutations at T41 or S45. Horizontal lines show the median value, boxes show the second and third quartiles and whiskers show the range. Samples with copy number gain spanning lower-effect mutations (n = 6) were excluded. Differences between groups were not significant in a one-way ANOVA (P = 0.098). f, Enrichment of Gene Ontology terms in transcripts ranked among the most upregulated in pairwise comparisons between strong and weak CTNNB1-mutant HCC samples from TCGA. Terms were selected from the full list shown in Supplementary Table 6. Normalized enrichment scores (NES) show enrichment scores normalized to the size of the gene set. P value estimation is based on an adaptive multi-level split Monte Carlo scheme, adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini–Hochberg correction. GSEA, gene set enrichment analysis. g, H&E tumor sections from TCGA were scored using an ordinal scale according to the level of inflammatory infiltrate from zero (no visible immune cells) to three (diffuse or nodular aggregates of immune cells), then scores were compared across patients based on β-catenin pathway mutation status. P value shows Fisher's exact test (two-way) for differences between weak and strong groups in the fraction of patients with an immune score of zero versus one or greater. Statistical analysis was not performed on other groups.

Source data

To assess the effects of other mutations in the β-catenin pathway, we compared transcript levels for ten liver β-catenin target genes in HCC tumors with hotspot missense mutations versus no CTNNB1 pathway mutation. We included missense mutations in CTNNB1 outside the hotspot region (‘other'; n = 19; Fig. 5a), including positions 335, 383 and 387, which disrupt interaction with the destruction complex subunit APC41, giving a total of 99 CTNNB1 missense mutation cases in the TCGA HCC cohort (n = 80 hotspot, n = 19 other). A further 10% of the cohort had coding mutations in AXIN1 (n = 36), another destruction complex subunit and known HCC driver8,42. The remainder of the cohort had no CTNNB1 or AXIN1 mutation (‘no mutation'; n = 217).

Tumors in either the weak or strong hotspot class showed markedly higher β-catenin target gene expression compared to the ‘no mutation' group (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7a). Tumors with ‘other' mutations in CTNNB1, or AXIN1 mutations, expressed these targets at levels comparable to the ‘no mutation' samples (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7a). Therefore, although AXIN1 and non-hotspot CTNNB1 mutations contribute to HCC development, their effects on β-catenin target gene expression differ from both weak and strong hotspot mutations16,42,43,44.

As predicted by our screen, β-catenin targets were expressed at significantly higher levels in tumors from the strong versus weak patient group (Fig. 5c,d and Supplementary Fig. 7a). This was observed across all ten liver target genes in the curated set (median 49% reduction in transcript levels for the weak group (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7a). Tumors with weak exon 3 mutations also displayed significantly lower expression scores for the Hallmark CTNNB1 target gene set from MSigDB (37% median reduction, P < 0.01; Fig. 5d). The same trend was confirmed in a second independent HCC cohort (Montironi cohort)14 (Supplementary Fig. 7b). β-catenin pathway activation in tumors with T41 mutations was comparable to that of strong β-TRCP docking motif variants, with both groups showing non-significant trends towards higher activation than tumors with the weak docking motif or S45 mutations (one-way ANOVA, P = 0.098; Fig. 5e). Overall, weak mutations still activated β-catenin targets, but at intermediate levels compared to strong mutations and non-mutated tumors (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7a).

Transcriptome-wide, genes upregulated in strong versus weak HCC samples were significantly enriched for the Gene Ontology term ‘canonical Wnt signaling pathway' as well as terms associated with proliferation and stem cell function (Fig. 5f, Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Notably, the telomerase subunit TERT was among the most significantly upregulated genes (Supplementary Table 5). TERT may be a direct transcriptional target of β-catenin regulation45, and activating mutations in the TERT promoter are among the most frequent HCC driver mutations8,46.

Genes upregulated in tumors with weak versus strong exon 3 mutations were significantly enriched for terms associated with immune cell infiltration (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Table 6). Given that β-catenin signaling activation is a major immune escape pathway in several tumor types, including HCC15,47, weaker pathway activation may permit greater immune engagement, with potential implications for patient stratification and targeted therapy15,48,49. Consistent with this idea, tumors with weak CTNNB1 mutations showed upregulation of canonical T cell transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 9) to levels similar to tumors lacking CTNNB1 mutations. In addition, histology confirmed more frequent immune cell infiltration in weak versus strong mutant tumors (65 vs 38% with a score of >1, Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0245; Fig. 5g). Altogether, CTNNB1 exon 3 hotspot MES scores derived from a cell-autonomous reporter assay predict not only β-catenin signaling strength in HCC, but also clinically relevant phenotypes associated with the tumor microenvironment (Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Fig. 9).

SGE enables genetic variants to be functionally assessed in their native chromosomal context using scalable, multiplexed assays. We developed an SGE screening assay to quantify the impact of all amino acid substitutions in the β-catenin degron on signaling activation, spanning a region that covers >80% of cancer-associated missense mutations. The data explain why particular CTNNB1 mutations are observed in cancer and others are not, despite disrupting residues known to be critical for degron function.

Our experimental design has three advantages over previous studies that have compared the phenotype of CTNNB1 mutations17,18,19. First, we tested the function of all 19 alternative amino acids at each position, providing a complete understanding of genotype–phenotype relationships. Second, variants were introduced by genome editing at the endogenous locus, avoiding artifacts associated with ectopic overexpression. Third, the function of each variant was evaluated in parallel, in the same population of primary stem cells with a normal functioning Wnt pathway, providing sensitivity to distinguish subtle phenotypic differences.

Previous studies introduced the concept that distinct CTNNB1 hotspot mutations activate the canonical Wnt pathway to varying degrees17,18,19. One study19 analyzed β-catenin target gene activation in benign and malignant liver tumors and proposed that signaling strength depends on mutation position: S45 mutations activate weakly, T41 mutations activate moderately and mutations within the docking site (32–37) activate strongly. Our dataset supports certain aspects of this model, including weaker activity of S45 variants, but also revealed that different substitutions at the same position can have markedly different effects on signaling (Fig. 3a,b). Small side chains at S45 are well tolerated, whereas amino acids at position I35 must support an extended β-sheet-like conformation (Fig. 3f), which is probably required for β-TRCP docking because the same requirement is observed at other β-TRCP-dependent degrons (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Table 4). Our data thus redefine the consensus motif for β-TRCP docking as DpSGβXpS, where β indicates any residue that supports an extended backbone conformation. At the adjacent position H36, proline is most disruptive (Fig. 2a), probably because of conformational rigidity, explaining why H36P is the only H36 mutation commonly observed in human cancer (Supplementary Table 1).

Our dataset enables functional interpretation for variants of unknown significance within the CTNNB1 hotspot (Supplementary Table 1) and supports reclassification of variants with known relevance in HCC. We find that common T41 mutations (T41A, T41I) are strong activators, with MES values exceeding the average of docking site mutants (Figs. 3c and 5e and Supplementary Fig. 6). Moreover, about 25% of docking motif mutations in HCC showed relatively low activation, comparable to S45 mutations, which we classify as weak (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 6). This nearly doubles the proportion of TCGA patients with weak CTNNB1 mutations.

On average, tumors driven by weak mutations express liver β-catenin target genes at ~50% levels relative to the strong group (Fig. 5c). Importantly, this group is also less likely to be immune-excluded (Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Fig. 9). We note the similarities between the weak group and the recently described β-catenin ‘immune-like' subtype14. Weakly activating exon 3 mutations could provide both a novel mechanism and biomarker for this patient group and help to guide strategies for personalized combination-based therapies.

Our COSMIC database analysis showed that tumors arising in different tissues harbor exon 3 mutations of different predicted strength (Fig. 4d). However, MES values were measured using a reporter gene in mouse ES cells. MES can predict endogenous β-catenin signaling outputs in mouse ES cells (Fig. 2d) and liver (Fig. 5c,d and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 7), and we expect that they will also have predictive power in other cell and tissue contexts. However, further work is required to show this empirically; other β-catenin-dependent tumor types in TCGA were not informative either because of low sample numbers (for example, adrenocortical carcinoma), low frequency of exon 3 mutant tumors (for example, colorectal adenocarcinoma, melanoma) or low diversity of MES values (for example, endometrial carcinoma).

The relationship between exon 3 mutations and signaling outputs in advanced tumors may not reflect earlier stages owing to epistatic effects of co-occurring mutations, together with environmental and metabolic changes that accompany tumor progression. This concern motivated us to conduct the SGE screen in non-transformed primary cells rather than a cancer cell line. We also leave open the possibility that MES values measured in mouse ES cells may lack physiological relevance in certain contexts; for example, where β-catenin is degraded by SCFFBXW11 rather than SCFβTRCP (ref. 50).

This work complied with all relevant ethical regulations. Animal work was approved by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol 03-12-017; principal investigator A.-K. Hadjantonakis). No human data were generated specifically for this study.

All guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed using the optimized CRISPR design webtool previously hosted by the Feng Zhang laboratory, Benchling (https://benchling.com) and Wellcome Sanger Institute Genome Editing (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/wge). The gRNAs were cloned into either pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (Addgene plasmid 48138) or pSpCas9(BB)-2A-mCherry52 and verified by Sanger sequencing.

A backbone vector (wild-type β-catenin vector) was generated by amplifying a 5.4 kb region of Ctnnb1 intron1–6 using primers 5′-GGTTGATACTACCTTGAGTACTC-3′ and 5′-GATTCACAGGGCTGCTAGTG-3′. The amplicon was cloned into the PCR4 TOPO vector using a TOPO TA cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Then, a Gibson cloning reaction was set up, including the wild-type β-catenin vector (amplified using primers 5′-GTGAGGCTTTCTTTGTTGGC-3′ and 5′-GTCAAAAGGCAGAATGAAAACAG-3′), PuroΔTKamplicon (5′-CTGTTTTCATTCTGCCTTTTGACCATAGAGCCCACCGCATCC-3′ and 5′-GCCAACAAAGAAAGCCTCACTACC GGGTAGGGGAGGCG-3′) and Gibson Assembly master mix (NEB) following the manufacturer's guidelines.

Mouse ES cells were derived from the TCF/Lef-H2B–GFP mouse line23 using published methods24. The cells were then co-transfected with the PuroΔTK targeting vector and Ctnnb1 sgRNAs 1–4 (5′-TCTGCCTTTTGACGGACATT-3′, 5′-CACCCTCCAGGGCTGCTGTG-3′, 5′-AAAGCCTCACAGGATCCACC-3′ and 5′-TGTTAGAGTTGGGCTAAGGC-3′) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. After Puromycin (1 µg ml−1) selection, individual clones were picked, grown and validated as heterozygously targeted by Sanger sequencing. Cells were then routinely maintained on gelatin-coated flasks in Knockout DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (GE Healthcare, HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 3 µM CHIR99021 (Axon Medchem), 1 µM PD0325901 (Axon Medchem) and leukemia inhibitory factor (hereafter referred to as R2i media).

A double-stranded DNA library was synthesized by Twist Biosciences, with each 200 bp fragment encoding a single distinct amino acid (n = 20 per site) spanning codons 31 to 48 of β-catenin. Each fragment was flanked by BbsI recognition sites for cloning and included synonymous mutations to enable specific amplification of HDR-edited alleles. Each fragment was then cloned individually into a β-catenin destination vector containing a 5.5 kb β-catenin intron1–6 sequence (5′-GGTTGATACTACCTTGAGTACTC-3′ and 5′-GATTCACAGGGCTGCTAGTG-3′) with two BbsI sites flanking the target region. After ligation, the reactions were transformed into Stbl3 competent cells and incubated overnight on a shaker at 37 °C. An equal volume of inoculum from each pool was then combined and used as a starter culture for a single maxiprep plasmid isolation of the pooled HDR template library (Qiagen Maxiprep kit).

TCF/Lef-H2B–GFP reporter cells with heterozygous PuroΔTK knockin at the endogenous Ctnnb1 locus were maintained in R2i media. A total of 200 × 106 cells were transfected with the pooled HDR template library and PuroΔTK sgRNAs 1–4 (spacer sequences: 5′-TGGGGATGCGGTGGGCTCTA-3′, 5′-CCACCGCATCCCCAGCATGC-3′, 5′-GCCTCCCCTACCCGGTAGTG-3′, 5′-GCCTCACTACCGGGTAGGGG-3′) in 26 six-well plates, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Small-molecule enhancer L755507 was used at a concentration of 5 µM. On day 3, R2i media was replaced with GMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (GE Healthcare, HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) and leukemia inhibitory factor, including FIAU at 0.2 µM to selectively kill cells that had not deleted the TK cassette. On day 5, a single-cell suspension was generated using trypsin, and the cells were sorted based on GFP intensity into six equally logged bins using BD FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences). In a parallel control condition, cells underwent an identical genome editing and selection procedure but were collected without flow sorting (the ‘pool' sample). The procedure above was repeated twice, starting with 200 × 106 cells in each case (400 × 106 cells total). Each set of cells went through the same editing, drug selection and flow sorting procedure described above and in Fig. 1d. The number of cells sorted from each bin is listed in Supplementary Table 7.

Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A first round of PCR was performed using a forward primer that annealed upstream of the homology arm (5′-GTGGACATCAGAGGACAACTTG-3′) and a reverse primer that annealed to a region containing the HDR-edited allele (5′-TGTCAACATCTTCTTCTTCGGGA-3′). The entire DNA sample was amplified in several 30-cycle reactions using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (NEB), then the amplicons were digested with DpnI (Thermo Scientific), gel-purified and pooled.

For library preparation for the Illumina sequencing platform, a second round of PCR was performed to incorporate Illumina-specific barcode, primer pad, linker and adaptors. The reactions were performed in triplicate for 14 cycles using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (NEB), then pooled and purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter).

The mouse embryonic feeder-free stem cell line E14IVtg2a (E14) was maintained on gelatin-coated flasks in GMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (GE Healthcare, HyClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) and leukemia inhibitory factor. E14 cells were targeted with the puroΔTK vector as described above for the Tcf/Lef-H2B–GFP reporter cells, then the puroΔTK cassette was replaced by HDR donor templates containing individual missense mutations at positions S37, T41 and S45, as shown in Fig. 1d. ES cell colonies were picked and expanded, and clonal lines with heterozygous knockin were identified by Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons.

Total RNA was isolated from approximately one million cells per sample using the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the generation of cDNA and the RNA-seq library, we adapted the mcSCRB-seq method53 using previously described modifications54, starting with 100 ng of total RNA per sample; Illumina paired-end sequencing of the library was then performed on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) following the manufacturer's instructions. After sequencing, Read 1 contained the cDNA information, and read 2 only contained the unique molecular identifier.

A Galaxy workflow consisting of the following tools was used to perform (reads to count) transcriptome analysis. Cutadapt (Galaxy version 4.0+galaxy1; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/lparsons/cutadapt/cutadapt/4.0+galaxy1) was first used to remove adapter sequences from fastq files. FastQC (Galaxy version 0.73+galaxy0; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/fastqc/fastqc/0.73+galaxy0) was then used to generate the Read Quality reports. UMI-tools extract (Galaxy version 1.1.2+galaxy2; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/umi_tools_extract/umi_tools_extract/1.1.2+galaxy2) was used to extract UMI from fastq files. Filter with SortMeRNA (Galaxy version 2.1b.6; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/rnateam/sortmerna/bg_sortmerna/2.1b.6) was used to filter reads for ribosomal RNAs in metatranscriptomic data. The reads from this filtered fastq files were aligned to mm10 build of mouse genome using RNA STAR the Gapped-read mapper for RNA-seq data (Galaxy version 2.7.8a+galaxy0; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/rgrnastar/rna_star/2.7.8a+galaxy0). UMI-tools deduplicate (Galaxy version 1.1.2+galaxy2; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/umi_tools_dedup/umi_tools_dedup/1.1.2+galaxy2) was used for deduplication of UMIs. MarkDuplicates (Galaxy version 2.18.2.3; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/picard/picard_MarkDuplicates/2.18.2.3) was used to examine aligned records in BAM datasets to locate and filter duplicate molecules. FeatureCounts (Galaxy version 2.0.1+galaxy2; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/featurecounts/featurecounts/2.0.1+galaxy2) was used to generate the counts from the alignment data in the BAM files. Bedtools BAM to BED converter (Galaxy version 2.30.0+galaxy1; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/bedtools/bedtools_bamtobed/2.30.0+galaxy1) was used to convert the alignment data from BAM to BED file format. Bedtools Genome Coverage (Galaxy version 2.30.0; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/bedtools/bedtools_genomecoveragebed/2.30.0) was used to record the genome coverage in bedgraph file format from the BED files with the alignment data. CONVERTER_bedgraph_to_bigwig (Galaxy version 1.0.1; https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=CONVERTER_bedgraph_to_bigwig) was used to convert the bedgraph file to bigwig file format for upload and visualization of the expression data on the UCSC or IGV genome browser.

The ‘mm10 Full' reference genome was used for the entire workflow. The counts table was converted into counts per million for all samples before normalization to z-score values, which were then used to generate a heatmap using the pHeatmap package (v.1.0.12) in RStudio. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering resulted in three main clusters. Differential gene expression analysis was then performed between clusters using the DESeq2 (Galaxy version 2.11.40.8+galaxy0) pipeline, and a final heatmap was generated using the pHeatmap package (v.1.0.12) in RStudio, limited to the list of genes that were differentially expressed between the three clusters.

Targeted and genome-wide mutations were downloaded from https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/download, filtered by gene CTNNB1, from COSMIC release v.94 (28 May 2021). Mutations labeled ‘Substitution – Missense' were extracted, excluding one multiple nucleotide polymorphism (p.I35_H36delinsSN).

Adaptors were trimmed and paired ends merged with NGmerge (https://github.com/harvardinformatics/NGmerge) to produce single-end reads. Mean sequence quality (Phred) scores were high (>30) across all base positions targeted for mutagenesis, so low-quality reads were not filtered out. Single reads were then aligned with bwa mem (v.0.7.17)55 to the 162 bp CTNNB1 reference sequence. A set of reads with a single missense on-target mutation, and no other mutations, was generated. Reads that did not fully cover the region targeted for mutagenesis (58–111 bp) were excluded, as were alignments with insertions and deletions anywhere, no mutations in the target region, mutations only outside the target region, multiple mutations in the target region, synonymous mutations only or mutations resulting in a codon that was not in the repair template library. The remaining reads had precisely one missense mutation specified from the HDR template library.

Read counts were normalized within each of the six experimental bins and two control conditions by dividing the number of reads for each mutation by the total number of filtered reads in that bin, such that the sum of normalized counts for all mutations in the bin was equal to 1. To calculate enrichment values relative to the starting population, the normalized count for each mutation in each bin was then divided by the normalized count for the same mutation in cells that had undergone the same genome editing and selection procedure but had not undergone flow sorting based on GFP. Replicates had high Pearson correlation (0.54–0.89 across GFP bins; Supplementary Fig. 3), so reads were merged for downstream analysis. Plasmid and unselected pool codon frequencies had a Pearson correlation of 0.63. Lastly, each of the six normalized mutant allele frequencies was multiplied by the mean GFP fluorescence value for all cells in the corresponding bin, and then the six values were added together to yield the MES. We noted that a subset of mutant alleles (31 out of 342) was underrepresented in the donor plasmid pool (<0.028% of reads observed versus 0.28% expected), probably as a result of non-uniform growth or processing of bacterial cultures before template pooling. These mutations are marked as ‘lower confidence' in Supplementary Table 2. None of the lower confidence mutations were observed among patients in TCGA or Montironi HCC cohorts.

VEP scores were obtained for all β-catenin single amino acid substitutions spanning amino acids 31–48 from 50 different methods, using a published pipeline26. The Spearman correlations were then calculated between the outputs of each predictor and the MES values. Note that some predictors only output scores for missense variants possible by single nucleotide changes, meaning that the correlations were calculated from fewer mutations; however, this has been shown to have little effect on overall correlations or relative predictor rankings56.

To investigate amino acid properties potentially related to the effects of mutations at I35, we downloaded all 566 indices from the AAIndex database35,37. The Spearman correlation was calculated between the values for each amino acid and the MES for each of the 19 substitutions at I35. These correlations are provided in Supplementary Table 8. Peptide sequences for previously reported βTrCP-dependent degrons were extracted from Table S1 of a previous publication37, then filtered for a precise match to the DSGX motif spanning positions 32–35 of β-catenin (n = 28 peptides, detailed in Supplementary Table 4).

Samples from TCGA-LIHC cohort (n = 370) were filtered into one of six groups (Supplementary Table 9): (1) ‘strong': those with a hotspot missense mutation with a MES value of >18,000 or MES < 18,000 plus copy number gain defined in cBioportal (n = 53); (2) ‘weak': those with a hotspot missense mutation with a MES value of <18,000 and no copy number gain (n = 27); (3) ‘other': those with a CTNNB1 missense mutation outside the hotspot region (n = 19); (4) ‘AXIN1': those with any coding mutation in AXIN1 (n = 36); (5) ‘no mutation': those without any coding mutation in CTNNB1 or AXIN1 (n = 217); and (6) ‘exclude': those with deletions and/or complex mutations in CTNNB1, those falling into more than one of groups (1) to (4) and those lacking survival and/or RNA-seq data (n = 18). Group (6) was excluded from further analysis.

For the Montironi cohort, we considered only patients with single missense mutations in the exon 3 hotspot (n = 44). Of those, 31 had mutations classified as strong based on the same classification system described above, including n = 2 with MES < 18,000 plus copy number gain, and 13 had mutations classified as weak.

Whole-slide images of haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (‘diagnostic slide') of TCGA-LIHC cohort were viewed using the NCI GDC Data Portal slide viewer; cases for which only a frozen section image (‘tissue slide') was available were not evaluated. Each case was scored by an expert consultant liver histopathologist and National Liver Pathology External Quality Assurance scheme member working at the national liver transplant center (T.K.), blinded to all new experimental data and without accessing any additional TCGA data. Intratumoral inflammation was scored using H&E morphology alone using a four-point ordinal scale57: 0, no inflammation; 1, scattered inflammatory cells; 2, focal aggregates of inflammatory cells; and 3, diffuse or nodular aggregates of inflammatory cells.

To compare transcriptomes of HCC samples from the categories shown in Fig. 5b, STAR transcript quantification for TCGA HCC samples (n = 361) was downloaded from the GDC Data Portal. Differential expression of samples in each category compared to the weak MES missense mutation was calculated with DeSeq2 (v.1.34)58 using shrunken log-fold changes. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the functional enrichment of the differentially expressed genes identified from RNA-seq data. The ranked list of differentially expressed genes was generated based on the DESeq2 statistics, which takes into account both fold-change and P value information. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed on the Gene Ontology database, which consists of three structured, controlled vocabularies. The enrichment analysis was carried out using the ClusterProfiler (v.4.6.2) package in R (v.4.2.0), using the ‘gseGO' function with default parameters59. The full output of this analysis is shown in Supplementary Table 6. For the analysis of β-catenin target genes, ten known targets (based on published literature) were identified among the 50 most upregulated transcripts in strong versus no mutation tumor groups from TCGA HCC dataset. We modeled expression as predicted by gene identity, HCC subgroup and their interaction using negative binomial models (R package MASS). We then obtained P values comparing expression in each HCC subgroup to ‘strong' as the baseline using marginal means testing implemented in the R package emmeans.

RNA-seq data from the Montironi cohort were generated and processed as previously described14. Hallmark expression scores were generated using the Wnt β-catenin Hallmark signature, using the ssGSEA pipeline implemented in Genepattern60,61. For human liver organoid data, normalized RNA-seq counts (fragments per kilobase per million) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (Accession ID GSE236490). Expression values were averaged for n = 2 biological replicates corresponding to each mutation.

Exome sequence variants from TCGA-LIHC (n = 375) and TCGA-UCEC (n = 404) were downloaded from the GDC Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov). Variants called by at least two of the four provided workflows (MuSE, MuTect2, SomaticSniper, VarScan2) were retained. Cases with one or more missense mutations in the 31–48 amino acid target region were extracted (TCGA-LIHC, n = 82; TCGA-UCEC, n = 104), and the single-nucleotide polymorphisms from these were used to generate tri-nucleotide mutation frequencies with SomaticSignatures62. The results shown are based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network (https://www.cancer.gov/tcga).

All possible mutational paths from one codon to another, one nucleotide change at a time, were generated for all codon pairs. The MLS of each path was calculated as \({\prod }_{i}{(\rm{freq}}_{i})\), where \({\rm{freq}}_{i}\) is the tri-nucleotide context mutational frequency of the \({i}^{\rm{th}}\) step of the path. The MLS of each codon change in every possible tri-nucleotide context is the sum of all paths between the two codons; similarly, the MLS for each amino acid change in its tri-nucleotide context is the sum of its codon change scores. A worked example is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5b, and MLS scores calculated separately from TCGA-LIHC and TCGA-UCEC are listed in Supplementary Table 11. For statistical testing, we modeled observed mutation frequencies as the result of MLS in the same tumor type, using a negative binomial generalized linear model implemented in the R package MASS. We compared these fits to null models fitting only the mean using likelihood ratio tests.

Statistical tests were performed in R (v.4.2.2) using RStudio (v.2022.12.0). All tests were two-sided unless stated otherwise. Sample size for the SGE screen was determined by the number of possible missense mutations between positions 31 and 48 of β-catenin, and all 342 variants were included. Sample sizes for clinical studies were determined by the number of patient samples available in relevant cohorts that could be unambiguously assigned to one category based on CTNNB1 pathway mutation status. No blinding or randomization was performed.

Biomolecular condensates have key roles in regulating cellular processes. Yet, the relationship between atomic features and condensate function remains poorly understood. We studied this relationship using the polar organizing protein Z (PopZ). Here, we revealed hierarchical assembly of PopZ into a filamentous condensate by integrating cryo-electron tomography, biochemistry, single-molecule techniques and molecular dynamics simulations. The PopZ helical domain drives filamentation and condensation, while the disordered region inhibits them. Phase-dependent conformational changes prevent interfilament contacts in the dilute phase and expose client-binding sites in the dense phase. Perturbing filament formation in vitro alters the dynamics of scaffold and client proteins and the condensate's wetting behavior. In cells, perturbing either filament formation or the ability of filaments to condense impairs PopZ function and leads to growth phenotypes. These findings establish a multiscale framework linking molecular interactions and condensate ultrastructure to cellular function.

Biomolecular condensates are nonstoichiometric assemblies of macromolecules that concentrate specific components while excluding others1,2,3. Their formation is driven by multivalent interactions implemented through intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), repeated oligomerization motifs or nucleic acid chains4,5. These dynamic assemblies are pervasive across biology, serving as a fundamental mechanism of cellular organization and mediating an array of cellular functions, including transcription regulation6, signal transduction7 and protein quality control8,9. They orchestrate cellular processes through the function of individual molecules within the condensate, as well as through the properties of the condensate itself10,11,12. These emergent properties—arising from the collective behavior of many molecules—include viscoelasticity13, surface tension14 and electrochemical potential15. Despite their importance, it remains a major challenge to link condensate-level properties to the molecular-level features from which they originate.

A particularly understudied question is how condensate function relates to its internal structure4,16. By internal structure, we refer to stable structures on the molecular and supramolecular level, larger than single molecules but smaller than the condensate itself. A notable supramolecular structure that has been observed for several condensates across different cellular pathways is the filament17. Unlike cytoskeletal filaments, which are long and designed for mechanical stability18, these condensate-associated filaments are typically short and flexible. The prevalence of filamentous condensates is illustrated by systems such as p62/SQSTM1 (hereafter p62)19, DAXX/SPOP20 and F-actin21, underscoring how useful a detailed characterization of this class of condensates could be.

To determine whether and how filamentation impacts condensate properties and function, it is essential to examine the individual and collective behavior of macromolecules across all relevant length scales—from molecular to filament to condensate level—in both dispersed and condensed states. Here, we elucidated the structure–function relationship of a condensate using in vivo and in vitro techniques, including cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), biochemical assays, single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and computational simulations.

The polar organizing protein Z (PopZ)22,23,24, a conserved protein within α-proteobacteria25, has a crucial role in cytosol organization. First identified in Caulobacter crescentus26,27,28, a well-studied model system for asymmetric cell division, PopZ forms condensates at the ends (poles) of the cell. These condensates selectively recruit cell-cycle-regulated proteins, establishing signaling gradients essential for driving asymmetric cell division29. Deletion of the popZ gene in C. crescentus results in abnormal cell division, disrupted chromosome segregation and loss of cellular asymmetry23,24. Furthermore, aberrations in the condensate's material properties (too fluid or too solid) lead to severe growth defects30. Beyond its role in C. crescentus, PopZ forms condensates across various systems, including in vitro, multiple bacterial species and human cells; it is also amenable to genetic engineering30.

In this study, we used an integrative approach to decode the structural and chemical determinants of PopZ condensate formation. We uncovered a hierarchical pathway in which PopZ assembles into trimers, hexamers, filaments and condensates. We characterized the conformational dynamics of individual PopZ molecules in both dilute and dense phases and observed phase-dependent conformational changes. Notably, the domain responsible for client binding in the dense phase also inhibits condensation in the dilute phase. Lastly, we perturbed specific steps in the assembly pathway to study the relationship between PopZ filaments and the properties of the resulting condensates. Our studies indicate that filamentation promotes condensate sphericity and slows down movements of PopZ and its clients in vitro and is tightly linked to PopZ function in vivo. While other filamentous condensates rely on separate proteins for filament formation, capping and crosslinking, PopZ integrates all three functions into a single 77-residue helical domain at its C terminus. Our work establishes a mechanistic analysis framework to understand how molecular-level features propagate across length scales and establishes a foundation for characterizing key attributes of filamentous condensates.

To investigate the supramolecular structure of PopZ within condensates, we purified recombinant wild-type (WT) PopZ, triggered condensation by adding 50 mM MgCl2 and visualized the resulting condensates by cryo-ET (Fig. 1a and Table 1). PopZ condensates were composed of filaments (Fig. 1a, middle). We quantified filament properties by segmenting tomograms with the software DragonFly (Comet Technologies)31 and tracing individual filaments using Amira (Thermo Fisher) (Supplementary Video 1). Filament lengths followed an exponential distribution (R2 = 0.99) with median and mean lengths of 34 nm and 38 nm, respectively (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Data 1). This distribution indicates isodesmic polymerization, a noncooperative filament formation where the association constant of building blocks is independent of filament length. In isodesmic polymers, there are no distinct nucleation and elongation phases, as the bonds between building blocks are identical and the affinity between them does not depend on their position within the filament32,33. Therefore, characterizing the PopZ filament reduces to identifying its building blocks and the bonds connecting them.

Source data

To investigate the relationship between filamentation and condensation, we analyzed cryo-ET tomograms of WT PopZ in the dilute phase (regions without condensates; Extended Data Fig. 1a). In the dilute phase, we observed fewer and shorter filaments, along with numerous speckles, which likely correspond to PopZ hexamers. These observations confirm that the increased concentration in the dense phase promotes filamentation (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d).

To confirm that WT PopZ forms filaments in vivo, we vitrified C. crescentus cells expressing mCherry-tagged WT PopZ and used cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling to create lamellae thinner than 200 nm. This reduction in specimen thickness, combined with high-magnification cryo-ET, yielded a detailed visualization of C. crescentus cells. We observed the previously described PopZ microdomains at the cell poles, which were devoid of large macromolecules, such as ribosomes (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Within microdomains, we identified filamentous structures consistent with WT PopZ filaments we observed in vitro and in agreement with findings by Toro-Nahuelpan et al., who visualized PopZ filaments in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense and C. crescentus34. Taken together, our structural characterization reveals that the underlying substructure of the PopZ condensate in vivo and in vitro consists of a meshwork of interwoven filaments, which themselves have a broad length distribution.

To characterize the driving forces of PopZ condensation, we screened different salt and pH conditions for their ability to trigger droplet formation. Divalent cations such as MgCl2 at physiological concentrations (2–5 mM) are sufficient for condensation, with higher concentrations accelerating assembly30. Low pH (<6.0) or increased concentrations of salt (>300 mM NaCl) also promote condensation (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We tested three buffering agents—sodium phosphate, HEPES and Tris-HCl—all of which supported droplet formation. PopZ formed smaller droplets in Tris-HCl buffer and occasionally formed nonspherical, aggregate-like clusters in a buffer lacking salt and divalent cations (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Using a physiologically relevant buffer with lower magnesium concentration and a crowding agent (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 with 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 5% PEG), we observed robust droplet formation.

PopZ's modular structure includes a C-terminal helical OD necessary for condensation29,35,36, a negatively charged, proline-rich IDR that imparts fluidity to the condensates30 and an N-terminal helical region (H1) that recruits binding partners into the microdomain37,38 (Fig. 2a,b). We reasoned that conditions promoting condensation screen repulsive interactions driven by the IDR. We previously showed that the length and charge distribution of the IDR affect the material properties of PopZ condensates in vivo30, indicating that the IDR influences condensate function. To test whether the IDR also affects its formation, we engineered a tobacco etch virus (TEV)-cleavable construct (H1–IDR–TEV–OD). Before cleavage, this construct mirrored WT PopZ's behavior, forming droplets only under condensing conditions. TEV cleavage separated the IDR from the OD, resulting in droplets made up entirely of OD and supernatant containing H1–IDR (Fig. 2c). Fluorescent labeling confirmed that OD droplets excluded the H1–IDR (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2c). Thus, when covalently attached to the OD, H1–IDR inhibits condensation through a mechanism that can be overcome using low pH, addition of divalent cations or high salt concentrations (more information in the Supplementary Text).

a, Schematic of the PopZ construct. The construct includes an N-terminal 6×His fusion (brown) fused to PopZ from C. crescentus, which codes for a short helical N-terminal region, H1 (pink box), a 78-aa IDR (gray curly line) and a C-terminal region comprising three predicted helices: H2, H3 and H4 (blue boxes). Positions −20 and 132 (indicated by asterisks) were used to covalently attach fluorescent dyes for imaging and smFRET studies. b, AlphaFold 3 model of the PopZ monomer shown for illustrative purposes. A TEV cleavage site, introduced between residues 99 and 100, is present in our PopZ construct only when specified. c,d, TEV cleavage separates the H1–IDR region from the OD, leading the OD to condense and H1–IDR to be excluded from the condensates. c, Representative SDS–PAGE gel with Coomassie staining. TEV protease was added to TEV-cleavable PopZ in vitro and incubated for 1 h before pelleting down the dense phase (2,000g, 3 min). MW, molecular weight; P, pellet fraction, which contains the OD; SN, supernatant, which contains the IDR. The IDR migrates as a larger species because of its stretches of densely packed negative charges. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results. d, Phase and fluorescence images 30 min after incubation with TEV protease. The formed droplets (phase) are composed of cleaved OD (OD–AF488) and exclude cleaved H1–IDR (H1–IDR–AF647). Experiments were repeated twice with similar results.

A total of three tomograms were recorded (Extended Data Fig. 3). The purple box indicates a zoomed-in region of the condensate. Scale bar, 100 nm. Right, a 3D rendering of filaments of the segmented tomograms.

Source data

To determine whether condensates formed by isolated OD are also composed of filaments, we inspected them using cryo-ET. Without MgCl2, these OD condensates exhibited an internal structure resembling that of WT PopZ condensates (Fig. 2e), indicating that the OD alone is sufficient for filament formation. When we analyzed the length distribution of OD filaments, we found that it closely matched that of WT PopZ, with both median and average lengths only 3–5 nm shorter (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Because this difference is smaller than the size of the building block itself, as discussed later, we conclude that the IDR has minimal influence on filament length.

The mechanism of condensation through interactions between structured filaments and their inhibition through an IDR remains largely underexplored, although similar mechanisms have been documented in a few systems17,19,21,39 (Discussion). Indeed, current phase-separation predictors did not capture PopZ's ability to condense (Supplementary Data 2). Thus, there is a need for predictors that can account for condensation driven by mechanisms involving polymerization, as used by PopZ.

To study the assembly pathway leading to PopZ filaments, we used mass photometry40,41, where WT PopZ at 250 nM concentrations adopted trimers and hexamers (Fig. 3a, gray). Buffer conditions and salt concentrations modulate the populations of these oligomers but both species were consistently present (Supplementary Data 3). The addition of 50 mM MgCl2 promoted the formation of higher-order oligomers such as 12-mers and 18-mers (Fig. 3a, middle), suggesting that PopZ forms filaments by stacking hexamers before condensation. Consistent with this interpretation, low pH and increased salt concentrations also promoted hexamer stacking (Supplementary Data 3). These conditions likely screen the repulsive negative charges of the IDR and thereby allow ODs of different hexamers to approach each other and interact.

Source data

To further elucidate the determinants of oligomeric assembly, we examined two PopZ variants shown to disrupt oligomerization in native gel electrophoresis and multiangle light scattering35: P146A and Δ172–177 (hereafter referred to as ΔL6, indicating the deletion of the last six residues). At 250 nM, P146A formed only trimers, whereas ΔL6 assembled exclusively into hexamers (Fig. 3a). Addition of MgCl2 did not induce higher-order oligomerization in either variant (Supplementary Data 3). Surprisingly, using light microscopy, we observed that both variants still formed condensates, albeit at higher saturation concentration (csat) than the WT, approximately 2 µM for P146A and 20 µM for ΔL6 versus ~0.5 µM for WT PopZ (Extended Data Table 1). We, therefore, studied the relationship between filamentation and condensate formation.

Mass photometry is unsuitable for monitoring oligomerization at micromolar concentrations, as it can no longer distinguish between a single large particle and two smaller particles landing close to each other. To study the oligomerization of dispersed PopZ in the micromolar range, we used analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC)42. AUC revealed distinct oligomerization patterns for P146A, ΔL6 and WT PopZ (Fig. 3b). WT PopZ (gray) formed the largest species, which we attributed to filaments of varying lengths. P146A (magenta) also formed higher-order oligomers, albeit smaller ones than WT PopZ, while ΔL6 (tan) did not exceed a sedimentation coefficient of 3, consistent with hexamers. Unexpectedly, WT PopZ populated a single species with a large s value rather than a distribution similar to that observed within the condensate by cryo-ET (Fig. 1b). This may result from higher concentrations required for AUC (100 µM) compared to cryo-ET and physiological conditions (5 µM), possibly leading to the formation of supramolecular clusters that limit filament growth. Because all three variants could form condensates, these data suggest that either filamentation is not strictly required for condensation or that ΔL6 requires magnesium, salt or low pH to form filaments.

To determine whether ΔL6-PopZ condensates are made up of filaments, we determined their ultrastructure using cryo-ET. Unlike WT PopZ and OD, ΔL6-PopZ condensates were composed of discrete hexamers (Fig. 3c), indicating that L6 is required for stacking the hexamers into filaments. This suggests that, while ΔL6-PopZ can condense without forming filaments, the reduced multivalency of hexamers compared to filaments likely causes the observed increase in csat.

The absence of filaments also impacted the condensate shape. The tendency of a liquid to minimize its surface area by forming a sphere is related to its surface tension14,43. WT PopZ droplets (Fig. 1a) appeared spherical with clear boundaries, indicative of high surface tension. In contrast, ΔL6 droplets had irregular boundaries and were deformed upon contact with the glass surface, displaying enhanced wetting behavior (Fig. 3d; comparison of WT, OD and ΔL6 in Extended Data Fig. 3). These observations indicate that loss of filamentation drastically affected surface tension.

Viscosity, another biologically important material property, relates to the diffusivity of molecules within condensates, which is often probed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)44. To test whether filamentation affects the diffusivity of PopZ, we incubated fluorescently labeled PopZ with WT, ΔL6 or a mix of both and performed FRAP (fitting details in Supplementary Data 4). In WT PopZ condensates (that is, filaments), recovery was negligible after 20 min. Adding hexameric ΔL6 enabled partial recovery, with a 40% mobile fraction and a 27-min half-time. This effect was amplified in ΔL6-only condensates, which had a 90% mobile fraction and 10-min recovery half-time (Fig. 3e, top right). Thus, PopZ diffuses more freely in hexamer-based condensates than in filamentous ones. These results provide a structural basis for emergent properties of the condensate.

Next, we addressed whether filament loss affects the diffusivity of condensate clients, defined as components that partition into and reside within preformed condensates45. In C. crescentus, PopZ interacts with clients through its H1 (refs. 37,46), which is distant in sequence from the OD and the last six residues. We examined the recruitment of the client ChpT47, an essential mediator within C. crescentus's cell-cycle circuit that directly binds to PopZ29. ChpT labeled with AF488 showed recovery after photobleaching in WT, mixed and ΔL6 droplets (Fig. 3f, bottom right). Recovery kinetics required a two-phase model, combining diffusion and binding/unbinding dynamics between ChpT and PopZ. Increasing the hexamer fraction (and, thus, decreasing the filament fraction) again sped up recovery and increased the mobile fraction (Supplementary Data 4). These results indicate that filamentous WT slows down ChpT movement to a greater extent than hexameric ΔL6-PopZ. In summary, the last six residues (172–177) enabled filament formation, which impacted the material properties of the condensate. Because WT PopZ can form filaments without condensing and ΔL6-PopZ can condense without forming filaments, we conclude that filamentation and condensation, while strongly coupled, are two distinct processes governed by different residues or driving forces.

Above, we found that PopZ forms trimers, hexamers and filaments. A structural description of these oligomeric states and how they interact to form condensates would provide deeper insights into PopZ biology and allow targeted sequence modifications for engineering purposes. To identify the determinants of PopZ oligomerization, we combined mass photometry and mutagenesis with structural models computed by AlphaFold 3 (ref. 48). AlphaFold 3 predicted that the trimeric form of PopZ features a hydrophobic core formed by a coiled coil of three H3H4 helices (residues 135–177) and stabilized by the hydrophobic effect (Extended Data Fig. 4a; summary of all structural models in Supplementary Data 5). This core remained stable when we included the H2 helix (residues 102–128) and the flexible linker connecting H2 to H3H4 (residues 129–135, which we refer to as ‘the loop'). In these predictions, the three H2 helices adopted variable orientations relative to H3H4, likely because of the flexibility of the loop connecting these segments (Extended Data Fig. 4b). To validate these predictions, we destabilized the putative hydrophobic core by substituting W151 and L152 (highlighted in Extended Data Fig. 4a,b) to glycine and serine, respectively, in the background of the P146A variant. During purification, this construct was prone to aggregation and mass photometry confirmed that it existed primarily as a monomer (Fig. 3a, right, OD* in blue), confirming that W151 and L152 are crucial for the stability of the trimer. We hypothesized that the trimeric core is a conserved feature across PopZ orthologs in α-proteobacteria. Using AlphaFold 2 (ref. 49), we predicted the structures of PopZ trimers from orthologs spanning hundreds of species across α-proteobacteria. In all cases, the predicted structures closely resembled the trimeric coiled coil of C. crescentus PopZ (Extended Data Fig. 4a), suggesting that it is a central feature of PopZ.

To characterize PopZ hexamers, we combined AlphaFold 3 structural models with experimental validation. We tested the models through mutagenesis and mass photometry to determine oligomeric states and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques, including subtomogram averaging and single-particle cryo-EM two-dimensional (2D) class averages, to resolve the hexamer shape and dimensions.

To pinpoint the minimal hexamer-forming segment, we designed a construct (H1–IDR–TEV–OD-ΔL6) missing the last six residues and separated H1–IDR from OD-ΔL6 after TEV cleavage (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Isolated OD-ΔL6 (residues 102–171) remained soluble at concentrations below 5 µM but formed droplets at higher concentrations, with mass photometry confirming hexamer formation (Extended Data Fig. 4d), indicating that neither L6 nor H1–IDR is necessary for hexamer assembly. Mass photometry of ΔH2-PopZ (lacking residues 102–128) revealed trimer and hexamer populations comparable to those of full-length PopZ (FL-PopZ) (Fig. 3a, right, gray and green), indicating H2 is also dispensable for hexamer formation. Lastly, mass photometry of Δloop-PopZ (lacking residues 129–134) showed a complete shift of the population to trimers (Fig. 3a, right, light gray), indicating that the loop connecting H2 to H3H4 is essential for hexamer formation (summary of sequence determinants in Fig. 6a). Thus, we identified residues 129–171 as the core hexamer-forming segment.

To define the hexamer shape and dimensions, we performed subtomogram averaging on hexameric ΔL6-PopZ. It resolved two predominant hexamer shapes: a straight one, measuring 100 Å in length, and a curved one, extending to 130 Å (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Disordered segments cannot usually be resolved in cryo-ET because of conformational variability, meaning the resolved shapes represent the structured OD. Modeling the hexamer-forming segment with AlphaFold 3 predicted head-to-head interactions between trimers mediated by the loop and H3 helices, with C termini projecting outward (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Comparing the hexamer and trimer models also suggests that H3H4 helices can slide with respect to each other (Extended Data Fig. 6a, bottom). Additional support for the AlphaFold 3 model came from single-particle cryo-EM 2D class averages of ΔH2ΔL6-PopZ (Extended Data Fig. 6b), although the complex's inherent flexibility limited high-resolution structural determination.

Including H2 in AlphaFold 3 yielded an S-shaped model with H2 bundles replacing H3 contacts, compatible with the curved 2D classes obtained in subtomogram averaging of ΔL6-PopZ (Extended Data Fig. 6c and Supplementary Data 1). Together, these results indicate that H3H4 helices form trimers that interact through the loop to assemble hexamers approximately 100–130 Å in length. Furthermore, the model suggests that the hydrophobic H2 helices project outward from the hexamer center, potentially forming interoligomer contacts with H2 bundles from other PopZ particles.

To gain high-resolution insights into WT PopZ filaments, we used subtomogram averaging on the segmented WT PopZ filaments. This approach proved challenging because of the heterogeneity and pronounced curvature of the filaments (Fig. 1a, bottom). To address this, we focused our analysis on a subset of straight filaments, which we isolated using a segmentation-based particle picking method. The class averages revealed that the filaments have the same width as individual hexamers, suggesting that filaments are formed through the longitudinal stacking of hexameric subunits (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Given that H2 is not required for hexamer formation (Fig. 3a), we explored its potential role in filament assembly. AUC showed that ΔH2-PopZ did not sediment beyond a coefficient of approximately 3, indicating that it remained hexameric, similar to ΔL6-PopZ (Extended Data Fig. 4d). This finding suggests that H2 contributes to filamentation either directly or indirectly.

To identify the specific residues within H2 involved in filament formation, we generated partial truncations of H2, deleting either residues 102–109 or residues 110–122. Surprisingly, neither construct restored filamentation (Extended Data Fig. 4e, coral and magenta), indicating that the entire H2 is necessary for this process. Therefore, both the H2 region and the last six residues are required for filamentation, either because they directly participate in the filament-forming interactions or because they enable PopZ to adopt a conformation needed for filamentation. The terminal position of the last six residues makes them more likely to facilitate the longitudinal stacking of hexamers, while the central position of H2 suggests it may stabilize a filament-favoring conformation. Taken together, our data indicate that PopZ filaments form through longitudinal stacking of hexamers, can bend considerably and require both the H2 region and the last six residues for proper assembly.

Condensation requires intermolecular interactions to become thermodynamically favorable over intramolecular interactions and solvent interactions50. Because PopZ forms supramolecular assemblies (that is, oligomers and filaments), the term intermolecular can be ambiguous. Therefore, we use the term interoligomer contacts to describe interactions between distinct PopZ particles, whether they are hexamers or filaments. To identify the regions responsible for interoligomer contacts, we performed a series of deletions along the PopZ sequence and assessed their impact on droplet formation using light microscopy.

Deleting the last six residues abolished filament formation and significantly increased csat (Extended Data Table 1), likely because of reducing multivalency rather than compromising interoligomer contacts. Similarly, deletion of the loop increased csat. In contrast, deleting the H2 region (102–128) completely prevented condensation in our standard buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM MgCl2), even at high protein concentration (100 µM). While ΔH2-PopZ formed droplets at elevated salt or magnesium concentrations (Extended Data Table 1), these droplets dissolved within ~20 min, suggesting that H2 stabilizes interoligomer contacts critical for condensation. Furthermore, partial deletion of H2 (Δ102–109 and Δ110–122) did not restore condensation, possibly because of destabilization of the H2 helix, suggesting that H2 promotes condensation not only through specific residues but also by maintaining its helical structure. In summary, while deletions within the OD that disrupt oligomerization or filamentation also increased csat, the removal of H2 precluded condensation under standard conditions altogether.

As an orthogonal approach to identify the contacts between trimers, hexamers and/or filaments that drive condensation, we conducted coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations51,52 of PopZ self-assembly (Methods). We validated our model by comparing the simulated propensity of PopZ to undergo phase separation across several solution conditions and mutations, showing qualitative agreement with our experimental data (Extended Data Fig. 5c). While we primarily focus on the condensation of trimers, hexamer simulations gave similar results (Extended Data Fig. 5d). To better understand the molecular interactions that drive condensation, we examined the intertrimer contact map of WT PopZ during cluster formation induced by 600 mM monovalent salt (Extended Data Fig. 5e). We identified interaction hotspots involving residues within H2, the middle of the H3H4 helix and the loop connecting these regions. Thus, the simulations indicate that H2 and H3H4 drive trimer–trimer interactions. It is likely that similar interactions among trimers, hexamers and/or filaments drive condensation in vivo.

To experimentally validate these computational predictions, we created a library of PopZ mutants, altering in the range of 2–11 residues predicted to be solvent accessible and interaction prone according to AlphaFold 3 and our MD simulations. We substituted these residues either from sticky to inert (for example, arginine to alanine) or from sticky to repulsive (for example, arginine to glutamic acid) (Extended Data Fig. 7a; details in Methods). We assessed the ability of these mutants to form condensates in Escherichia coli (Extended Data Fig. 7c), finding that condensation could be disrupted by mutations in either H2 or H3H4 alone. We purified four of these constructs and confirmed by mass photometry that they could still form trimers and hexamers, suggesting that their structural integrity was preserved (Extended Data Fig. 7d). In vitro, three of four constructs retained the ability to form condensates, although their csat was increased by an order of magnitude. These results suggest that condensation does not depend exclusively on any single residue or module; rather, an ensemble of sticky residues is distributed across the H2, loop and H3H4 regions. Each of these residues contributes to lowering csat and collectively they promote condensation.

In summary, both experimental and computational data suggest that interoligomer contacts are formed by multiple residues across H2, the loop and H3H4.

We showed above that the H1–IDR segment inhibits OD condensation unless divalent cations, high salt or low pH are present (Fig. 2d). To investigate this mechanism, we monitored the proximity of the N terminus to the OD using smFRET53,54. We labeled the same cysteine positions as in Fig. 2d (C−20 and C132) within the same molecule and verified that labeling did not disrupt oligomer or condensate formation (Extended Data Fig. 8a). For smFRET experiments, we supplemented this PopZ FRET reporter (at ~300 pM) with a 16,667-fold excess of unlabeled WT PopZ (5 µM) to prevent formation of oligomers with more than one FRET reporter, which could lead to artifacts in FRET parameters.

With 151 disordered residues between the two dyes, we expected a low FRET efficiency (EFRET < 0.1) on the basis of mean distance predictions of 91 Å for a random chain55 and >100 Å for the actual sequence according to ALBATROSS, a deep learning algorithm56,57. We indeed observed a population at low EFRET ~ 0.1 (Fig. 4a). However, we also observed an intermediate EFRET state (mean EFRET > 0.5, average interdye distance of ~54 Å), suggesting that the N terminus and the OD can come much closer to one another than expected in the absence of intra-PopZ interactions. Photon distribution analysis (PDA)58 showed that 67% of PopZ molecules adopt the compacted state (intermediate EFRET). Denaturing and weakening PopZ intermolecular interactions with 6 M Gdn-HCl significantly reduced the population of the compacted state, confirming an interaction (Fig. 4b, right, tan).

a, smFRET reveals that PopZ adopts extended and compacted conformations in the dilute phase. FRET efficiency distribution of the smFRET reporter labeled at C−20 and C132 shows two predominant conformations in the dilute phase (light gray): extended and compacted. The extended conformation coincides with the predicted behavior of a random coil (dark gray), whereas the compacted conformation indicates proximity between the N and C termini. b, H1 drives the compacted conformation. Left, schematic illustrating two experimental conditions. Top, in the first condition, labeled FL-PopZ was mixed with an excess of unlabeled WT PopZ. For each labeled PopZ monomer (fluorophores indicated by green and red circles), two unlabeled PopZ monomers are shown, where the H1 of the unlabeled monomer competes with the H1 of the labeled monomer for a binding site on the OD (excess WT). Bottom, in the second condition, labeled FL-PopZ was mixed with an excess of unlabeled ΔH1-PopZ (missing residues 1–23). In this case, only H1 of the labeled PopZ monomer can bind the OD (excess ΔH1). Right, FRET efficiency plot shows that excess WT promotes the extended conformation (gray), similar to the denaturing condition (tan). In contrast, excess ΔH1-PopZ promotes the compacted conformation (blue). Error bars in the inset represent 95% confidence interval estimated by a Jacobian in PDAFit (nWT = 3,955 bursts; nGdn-HCl = 1,203 bursts; nΔH1 = 3,158 bursts). c, ChpT does not interact with PopZ in the dilute phase. Left, FRET efficiency histograms indicate that ChpT at 5 µM (tan) only marginally increased the population of the extended conformation of PopZ (gray). Right, mass photometry and sedimentation coefficient distribution from AUC for individual samples of PopZ (gray) and ChpT (magenta), as well as combined samples (tan). The combination did not indicate the formation of a new PopZ:ChpT species. Error bars in the inset represent 95% confidence interval estimated by a Jacobian in PDAFit (nWT = 3,955 bursts; nChpT = 3,162 bursts). d, H1 recruits ChpT to PopZ condensates. Fluorescence microscopy images show 1 nM ChpT labeled with AF488 recruited by FL-PopZ condensates (top), whereas ChpT remains diffuse in the presence of condensates of isolated OD (bottom).

Bottom left, the 2D histograms of FRET efficiency versus burst duration. Durations greater than 15 ms (turquoise box) were selected to isolate fluorescence bursts coming from within condensates.

Error bars in the inset represent 95% confidence interval estimated by a Jacobian in PDAFit (nWT = 3,955 bursts; ncondensed = 1,049 bursts). f, A model of phase-dependent interactions. In the dilute phase, H1 is predominantly bound to the OD, preventing ChpT (green) from interacting with H1. In the dense phase, H1 is released from the OD, enabling ChpT binding.

Source data

Because H1 is the only structured element in the N terminus, we hypothesized that H1 binds the OD directly. If so, H1 from both the labeled FRET reporter and the unlabeled PopZ would compete for the OD. To reduce such competition, we supplemented the FRET reporter with unlabeled ΔH1-PopZ instead of unlabeled WT (Fig. 4b, left). Under these conditions, the population of the compacted state rose significantly, confirming that H1 is responsible for bringing the N terminus into proximity of the OD (Fig. 4b, right, blue).

This interaction is also predicted by AlphaFold 3, although the predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) and overall model scores are low (Extended Data Fig. 8b).

Given that H1 is responsible for client binding, we expected clients such as ChpT to stabilize the extended state of PopZ. Surprisingly, adding 5 µM ChpT had little effect on the extended population (Fig. 4c) despite this being a csat according to previous studies of the ChpT–PopZ interaction29,37. These two studies, however, may have altered PopZ behavior; Lasker et al.29 immobilized PopZ on an SPR surface, possibly affecting its fold and oligomerization, while Holmes et al.37 removed the OD to make PopZ amenable for NMR, thereby eliminating the compacted state entirely. To test whether ChpT binds to dispersed PopZ with orthogonal techniques that do not compromise its structural integrity, we turned to mass photometry and AUC at physiological and supraphysiological concentrations. Neither technique revealed any detectable ChpT binding to dispersed PopZ (Fig. 4c, right). In contrast, condensed PopZ robustly recruited AF488-labeled ChpT (Fig. 4d), even at 100-fold lower concentrations. Recruitment was lost in droplets of isolated OD where H1 is absent. These results suggest condensation substantially enhances ChpT–PopZ interactions.

To rationalize the lack of robust ChpT–PopZ interactions in the dilute phase, we hypothesized that the H1–OD interactions in the dilute phase prevent H1–ChpT interactions, whereas condensation suppresses these interactions, enabling client recruitment. To test this, we repeated the smFRET experiment on condensed WT PopZ by adding 50 mM MgCl2. The addition of magnesium led to a drastic increase in the observed burst durations (the time a labeled molecule spends in the detection volume) compared to dispersed PopZ (Fig. 4e, top left). We plotted the duration of fluorescence bursts versus EFRET to select only bursts belonging to slow-moving species (that is, droplets; Fig. 4e, bottom left). The plot shows that condensation shifted the entire population to the extended state, where H1 and OD are far from each other (Fig. 4e, right). Together, these findings support a model where, in the dilute phase, H1 interacts with the OD, serving as a competitive inhibitor of ChpT binding, while condensation relieves this inhibition, allowing ChpT recruitment. We note that, even though one third of the dispersed population featured an extended H1, ChpT was unable to bind PopZ until it condensed, suggesting that even the extended H1 fraction in dispersed PopZ may not be as accessible as H1 within condensates. This mechanism combines avidity with a condensation-dependent conformational switch (Fig. 4f).

Our model implies that removing H1 would promote the extended state and might allow condensation without divalent cations, salt or low pH. However, purified ΔH1-PopZ did not form spherical droplets. Instead, addition of magnesium led to aggregate-like clusters (Extended Data Fig. 8c, left), similar to those at low pH without salt or magnesium. In AUC, ΔH1-PopZ formed nonnative species that grew much larger than WT PopZ (Extended Data Fig. 8c, right). We propose that, without the tethering of H1 to the OD, PopZ can get trapped in aggregation-prone intermediates. The IDR likely has an important role in the formation of these intermediates, as isolated OD, which lacks both H1 and the IDR, is well behaved in vitro (Fig. 2).

To assess the role of PopZ filamentation in vivo, we expressed filament-deficient mutants in C. crescentus cells. Replacing WT PopZ, which forms polar foci, with hexameric PopZ (ΔL6-PopZ) led to a uniform cytoplasmic distribution of PopZ35, indicating that filaments are important for condensation by increasing multivalency, consistent with our in vitro findings. To determine whether filamentation confers functional benefits, we expressed low levels of mCherry–ΔL6-PopZ in otherwise WT cells, mimicking our in vitro mixing experiments (Fig. 3e,f, blue FRAP curves). Even at low expression (Methods), mCherry–ΔL6-PopZ was toxic, completely inhibiting cell growth (Fig. 5a).

At the start of the cell cycle, ParB forms a complex with the parS centromere that is anchored to the PopZ condensate at the old pole. During chromosome replication, one copy of the ParB:parS complex remains anchored at the old pole through ParB interactions, while the other copy migrates to the new pole, associating with PopZ with assistance from a ParA gradient to facilitate rapid migration61,62. c, The effect of PopZ mutants on DNA segregation.

Middle, representative time-lapse images of synchronized cells at three time points, starting from swarmer cells. The cells express mCherry–PopZ variants from a plasmid, while CFP–ParB (blue) replaces WT ParB to track DNA segregation. Checkmarks or crosses indicate whether chromosome segregation proceeded properly, that is, whether ParB foci were anchored and the old pole, replicated, migrated to the new pole and were captured at the new pole within expected time frames. Bottom, kymographs displaying the cell body (black) and CFP–ParB (cyan) over time. Time progresses from left to right. The old pole is positioned at the bottom, while the new pole is at the top. Scale bar, 1 µm.

Source data

To investigate this toxicity, we monitored DNA segregation using the ParABS partitioning system59,60 (Fig. 5b). Labeling the centromere-binding protein ParB with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) allowed us to track its motion throughout the cell cycle as a probe for PopZ's ability to anchor and capture ParB foci. Low-level expression of mCherry–WT PopZ alongside native PopZ did not disrupt ParB anchoring at the old pole, migration or capture at the new pole. In contrast, low expression levels of mCherry–ΔL6-PopZ caused severe phenotypes, localizing partially at the pole and dispersed throughout the cytosol (Fig. 5c). We also observed increased dynamics, frequently exchanging between the pole and cytosol and impaired the ability to capture and anchor ParB:parS complexes at the poles (kymographs in Fig. 5c).

To assess whether the observed aberrations in ParB:parS anchoring were because of impaired PopZ structure at the pole, its presence in the cytosol or both, we examined two additional mutants: Δ133–177, lacking the H3H4 region and incapable of condensation and polar localization, and ΔH1Δ133–177, which is unable to bind clients (Fig. 5c). While Δ133–177 drastically slowed down ParB motions, deletion of H1 restored normal function, suggesting that cytoplasmic PopZ that is unable to interact with clients is not harmful. However, when we deleted H1 from ΔL6-PopZ, cells were still unable to anchor or capture ParB:parS foci, indicating that ΔL6-PopZ impairs in vivo function by interfering with the WT PopZ condensate rather than through aberrant client interactions. In summary, our results indicate that filamentation is crucial for the function of PopZ condensates in vivo, not merely by enhancing multivalency but by maintaining condensate integrity essential for proper DNA segregation.

In the first section, we showed that condensation promotes filamentation and, here, we demonstrated that filamentation is required for PopZ's biological function. We next asked whether PopZ filaments must reside within condensates to carry out their function or whether dispersed filaments are sufficient. Therefore, we searched within our mutant library of PopZ variants with reduced stickiness (Extended Data Fig. 7) for mutants that form filaments but fail to condense. We used cryo-ET on the mutants named Loki and Ganesha to assess whether they form filaments. Both mutants successfully formed filaments; however, at physiological PopZ concentration (5 µM), only Loki formed condensates (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b), which resembled the WT. With these and other constructs in hand, we next asked whether reducing condensation in favor of dilute-phase filaments could recover PopZ function in ΔpopZ Caulobacter cells (Extended Data Fig. 9c).

In Caulobacter, dispersed PopZ is distributed throughout the cytoplasm, whereas condensed PopZ forms distinct polar foci. Deletion of popZ results in pronounced cell elongation and abnormal morphology22,23. Therefore, to evaluate the condensate-forming capability of constructs from our mutant library, we expressed each variant from an inducible promoter in ΔpopZ cells for 4 h. We then measured polar enrichment as a proxy for condensation (Extended Data Fig. 9d, left) and cell length as an indicator of restored function (Extended Data Fig. 9d, middle). We observed a clear inverse correlation between polar enrichment (condensation) and cell length (functional rescue), indicating that reduced condensation compromises the biological activity of PopZ filaments (Extended Data Fig. 9d, right). Taken together, these data make a case that neither condensates made up of speckles (for example, ΔL6-PopZ) nor dispersed filaments (for example, construct Ganesha) fully support PopZ's biological function. Rather, this function requires condensates made up of filaments.

The objective of this study was to characterize the relationship between the primary sequence of PopZ and its supramolecular assembly into condensates. We found that PopZ monomers form hexamers through trimerization mediated by helices H3 and H4, followed by head-to-head dimerization of trimers involving loop and helix residues, giving rise to a structure with outwardly directed C termini. The IDR and H1 helices extend from this core, modulating condensation by creating electrostatic repulsion that prevents premature interoligomer contacts. Upon charge neutralization, this repulsion is relieved, promoting filamentation and enabling condensation. Polymerization greatly enhances multivalency, while condensation further promotes polymer assembly through increased local concentrations, thereby defining the condensate's ultrastructural and physical properties, including increased viscosity and surface tension. A more detailed discussion of these findings is provided in the Supplementary Text and Table 1.

(iii) AlphaFold 3 hexamer model displaying interactions between two trimers (colored purple and green) mediated by intertrimer H2 region interactions. The IDRs extend from the center of the hexamer, creating a negatively charged cloud around it. Four of the six H1 helices are shown proximal to their corresponding H3H4 regions.

(iv) Fitting of three hexamers (purple and green) into a density extracted from the condensate tomogram (yellow), demonstrating a tail-to-tail organization between hexamers with IDRs extending from the center of each hexamer. In this configuration, the IDRs are positioned away from H3H4 and are involved in binding client molecules.

A scale bar is shown for each circle. c, Phase-dependent interoligomer contacts. Left, trimer and hexamer interactions in the dilute phase, with the gray ellipse representing a cloud of negative charge because of negatively charged residues and the flexibility of the IDR. Right, in the dense phase, conformational changes opening the H1 helices remove the IDR cloud around hexamers, enabling interfilament contacts.

The hierarchical and modular nature of PopZ condensation parallels other filament-driven systems such as p62, F-actin and SPOP/DAXX, highlighting common principles such as regulated polymerization, length control and multivalent crosslinking. Interestingly, PopZ filaments exhibit an intrinsic regulatory mechanism that allows condensate formation independent of external cellular factors, as demonstrated by the self-contained interplay between filament length, density and client recruitment. In α-proteobacteria, the evolutionarily tunable IDR tail provides an elegant means to regulate condensate properties crucial for cellular fitness, including viscosity for client retention and surface tension for compartmental integrity. These findings suggest broader principles for filament-driven condensates, emphasizing intrinsic polymerization control as a versatile strategy across biological systems.

E. coli MG1655 strain was grown in M9G liquid medium supplemented with kanamycin (5 µg ml−1). Overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in the same medium until they reached log phase (optical density at 600 nm (OD600) ≈ 0.5) at which point they were pelleted and resuspended to an OD600 of 0.12 in LB supplemented with kanamycin and with 0.02% arabinose to induce expression of PopZ variants from a pBAD vector. After 1 h of induction, bacteria were transferred to a pad of M9 with 1.2% agarose and 0.02% arabinose and imaged.

Caulobacter strains were grown at 30 °C in peptone yeast extract (PYE) or M2G liquid medium supplemented with kanamycin (5 µg ml−1). When indicated, cells were synchronized as follows63. First, 30 ml of bacteria in log phase were pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of cold M2, pelleted again and resuspended in 900 µl of M2 and 900 µl of Percoll (Cytiva). They were then pelleted for 20 min at 15,000g and 4 °C to separate swarmer and stalked cells. Swarmer cells were transferred into M2 and washed three times. Finally, the bacteria were resuspended in PYE and diluted to an OD of 0.12 and transferred to a pad of PYE and 1.2% agarose. Expression of PopZ variants was induced indirectly through the leaky expression from PYE medium35.

PopZ was expressed and purified from E. coli strain BL21. Cells were grown in 0.5 L of Luria–Bertani medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg ml−1) to an OD of 0.4 at 37 °C and then switched to an induction temperature of 18 °C for 20 min before induction. PopZ expression was induced overnight with 0.1 mM IPTG. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C.

The entire purification was conducted under denaturing conditions of 8 M urea to prevent aggregation and condensation of PopZ. The frozen cell pellet was resuspended in approximately 100 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 8 M urea, 20 mM imidazole and one tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Pierce) for every 50 ml of lysis buffer. Cells were lysed by sonication and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 30 min at 12 °C. The supernatant was injected onto a 5-ml HisTrap FF (Cytiva) using an AKTA Go system (Cytiva). The supernatant was reinjected once. PopZ was eluted through a step gradient of imidazole. The eluted PopZ was diluted fourfold in ion-exchange buffer A, containing 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl and 8 M urea. The diluted sample was then loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap Q FF (Cytiva) ion-exchange column and eluted with a salt gradient. The purified protein was flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C. It was buffer-exchanged into the desired buffer immediately before experiments. Purity of PopZ variants was assessed using SDS–PAGE and mass spectrometry.

First, 50–200 µl of 10-nm gold fiducials (Aurion) were spun down in a benchtop centrifuge for 20 min at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was removed and the beads were washed twice with standard buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM MgCl2). They were then resuspended in an appropriate amount of buffer, resulting in a 12.5–20% higher bead concentration than the original gold fiducial concentration. Quantifoil R 2/1 copper 200-mesh grids were glow-discharged with a Pelco easiGlow (Ted Pella, 25 s of glow at 15 mA). Then, 2.3 µl of gold fiducial beads were deposited onto the grid. The beads were given 30 s to spread out. Next, 4 µl of the PopZ sample was deposited onto the grid, backblotted and plunged into a mixture of propane and ethane using either a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 2.5 s of blot time, 0 s of wait time, 0.5 s of drain time and blot force of 0) at 22 °C, 90% humidity or a homemade gravity-driven plunging device. We used 2 µM as the PopZ concentration to obtain droplets that were small enough to fit into the field of view. After freezing, the vitrified grids were clipped with autogrids (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The ΔpopZ C. crescentus strain expressing mCherry–WT PopZ through a pXMCS-2 plasmid was grown at 30 °C in PYE supplemented with kanamycin until an OD600 of 0.2– 0.5 and then diluted 100-fold and grown until an OD600 of 0.3. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in PYE to an OD600 of 3. Next, 5 µl of the sample was deposited on glow-discharged (Pelco easiGlow; 25 s of glow at 15 mA) Quantifoil R 2/1 copper 200-mesh grids. The grids were then backblotted for 7–12 s before plunge freezing with a Vitrobot Mark IV into a mixture of 37% propane and ethane. After freezing, the vitrified grids were clipped with autogrids.

C. crescentus samples were subjected to cryo-FIB milling to reduce sample thickness and increase image contrast. Cryo-FIB milling was performed using the Aquilos 2 dual-beam cryo-FIB–scanning EM instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sample was sputtered with metallic platinum for 15 s, followed by a layer of organometallic platinum for 40 s, and then sputtered again with metallic platinum for 15 s. The metallic platinum helps to reduce charging and drifting while milling and the organometallic platinum helps to protect the sample from the FIB. Targeted regions on the grid were milled to produce lamellae with a thickness of approximately 150–200 nm. Finally, the grid was sputtered with metallic platinum for 15–20 s. The final sputter coat adds bead-like fiducial inclusions that are used for tilt-series alignment.

Both in vitro PopZ samples and cryo-lamellae of Caulobacter samples were imaged with a Titan Krios 300-keV microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a field-emission gun, a direct detection device (Gatan K3) and an energy filter (operated with a slit width of 20 eV). The SerialEM64 package with PACEtomo65 scripts was used to collect image stacks at tilt angles ranging from +51° to −51° (3° increment) using a dose-symmetric scheme with a cumulative dose of ~106 e− per Å2. Images were taken at a magnification resulting in 1.663 Å per pixel and a nominal defocus of −6 to −5 µm. Image stacks containing ~10 frames were motion-corrected with MotionCor2 (ref. 66) and assembled and aligned by IMOD64. All tomograms used in the figures were denoised with CryoCARE67 followed by Isonet68.

For in vitro PopZ data, 4× binned tomograms were imported into EMAN2 (ref. 69). Straight segments of PopZ filaments were selected using a segmentation-based particle picking function. Particle positions were translated into the IMOD coordinate system to be imported into the i3 (ref. 70) subtomogram averaging software. Before averaging, the contrast transfer function (CTF) of tilted images was estimated using gCTF71, CTF correction was performed using the IMOD ctfphaseflip function and CTF-corrected tomograms were created using IMOD. An initial reference was created by manually picking ~100 straight segments of filaments with predefined orientations using Tomopick72 software and averaging them using i3. Using this initial reference, the remaining particles were aligned and classified.

For dense-phase characterization, denoised in vitro PopZ tomograms were segmented using the deep learning tool in Dragonfly (Comet Technologies)31. For dilute-phase characterization, undenoised tomograms were segmented. The 2D UNet models were trained on hand-segmented frames of the tomogram. The model was applied to the entire tomogram and significant false positives were manually removed from the three-dimensional (3D) renderings. The island removal feature in Dragonfly was used to eliminate independent densities smaller than the size of a PopZ hexamer, thereby reducing noise from the segmentation results.

In vitro PopZ segmentations were used in Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for filament tracing. The following parameters for cylinder correlation were derived from measurements of PopZ filaments in IMOD: cylinder length, 100; angular sampling, 5; mask cylinder radius, 30; outer cylinder radius, 27; inner cylinder radius, 0. Filaments shorter than 250 Å were excluded because filaments shorter than 250 Å tend to be fragmented parts of longer filaments. The parameters used for the trace correlation lines were as follows: minimum seed correlation, 50; minimum continuation, 100; direction coefficient, 0.4; minimum distance, 75; minimum length, 250; search cone length, 60; search cone angle, 45; minimum step size, 5. Tracing results were exported into xml files containing the filament tracing metadata table. Parameters such as curved lengths and chord lengths were imported into Prism for further analysis. Statistical significance was determined using the Mann–Whitney U-test and the histogram of curved lengths was analyzed using a nonlinear regression (curve fit) approach. For tracing of dilute-phase particles, the following parameters for cylinder correlation were derived from measurements of PopZ filaments in IMOD: cylinder length, 20; angular sampling, 5; mask cylinder radius, 36; outer cylinder radius, 30; inner cylinder radius, 0. The parameters used for the trace correlation lines were as follows: minimum seed correlation, 120; minimum continuation, 70; direction coefficient, 0.8; minimum distance, 70; minimum length, 0; search cone length, 20; search cone angle, 80; minimum step size, 5.

Samples were kept at 4 °C throughout the entire preparation process. ΔH2ΔL6-PopZ was prepared at 2 mg ml−1 in a buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl. Quantifoil 300-mesh R0.6/1 UltrAuFoil holey gold films were glow-discharged under vacuum for 30 s at 15 mA in a Pelco easiGlow 91000 glow discharge cleaning system (Ted Pella). Then, 3 μl of sample was applied to the surface of the grid and blot-plunged using a manual plunger in a 4 °C cold room with ~95% humidity. Grids were manually blotted with Whatman 1 filter paper for 10 s and immediately plunged into a liquid ethane pool cooled by liquid nitrogen. Grids were then clipped into AutoGrids (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under liquid nitrogen vapor and stored in liquid nitrogen until the day of imaging.

Cryo-EM data were collected on a Thermo Fisher Talos Arctica transmission EM instrument operating at 200 keV, which was aligned for parallel illumination settings with a 30-µm condenser 2 aperture. Micrographs were collected using a Falcon 4i electron detector, with an applied total electron exposure of 50 e− per Å2. The EPU data collection software was used to collect micrographs at ×190,000 nominal magnification (0.74 Å per pixel at the specimen level) with a nominal defocus range set to 0.8 to 1.4 µm under focus. A maximum image shift of 8 µm with aberration-free image shift was used to obtain a single exposure in the center of the 0.6-µm holes.

A total of 8,762 micrographs were collected and processed in real-time using cryoSPARC Live (version 4.5.3)73. Patch motion correction was used to mitigate motions and radiation damage that occur during imaging. Motion-corrected images were processed collectively at the end of data collection, beginning with CTF estimation using CTFFIND4 (ref. 74). The 7,042 micrographs with reported CTF resolutions better than 8 Å were selected for further processing and 5,899,512 particle selections were identified using a blob picker with default parameters, a minimum particle diameter of 70 Å and a maximum particle diameter of 100 Å. Particle selections that had local power between 426.0 and 967.0 were used for subsequent processing, leaving a total of 3,595,338 particles that were extracted using a box size of 194 pixels. A 2D classification of this extracted stack into 75 classes was performed using default parameters with the exception of 40 online EM iterations and a batch size of 400 per class.

Epifluorescence microscopy was performed on a Nikon Ti2-E automated inverted microscope with a ×100 oil-immersion objective (CFI60 plan apochromat lens, numerical aperture: 1.45; Nikon) and a Kinetix scientific complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor camera (Teledyne Photometrics). Images were acquired with the NIS Elements software version 5.42.03 and further processed in ImageJ or MicrobeJ. Bacteria were grown in liquid medium to an OD of 0.1–0.3 and put on pads (1.2% agarose in PYE) secured between coverglass and No. 1.5 coverslips by silicone gaskets (VWR). mCherry was excited with the 594-nm epi line at 12% intensity and imaged with 100-ms exposure time using a 603–800-nm emission filter. CFP was excited with the 440-nm line at 15% intensity and imaged with 800-ms exposure time using a 464–486 nm emission filter.

For FRAP experiments, the same instrument was used but images were acquired using a total internal reflection fluorescence iLAS2 module (Gataca Systems). Before the experiments, unlabeled WT PopZ and ΔL6-PopZ were mixed with either labeled ChpT or labeled PopZ and incubated for 12 h before condensation was triggered to allow the sample to equilibrate. After droplets formed, they were allowed to settle until the intensity of the whole image was stable, usually 2 h. Droplets were partially bleached in their center using a point stimulation. Data were corrected for photobleaching and time-dependent changes in intensity by including unbleached reference droplets and then normalized. The data were fitted in GraphPad Prism to a simple exponential for labeled PopZ and a two-phase model for labeled ChpT.

For measurement of PopZ polar enrichment and C. crescentus cell length, MicrobeJ and imageJ were used. To obtain polar enrichment, the background was first subtracted from images using a rolling ball (radius: 50 pixels) in imageJ75. Then, a circle with a diameter of 5 pixels was used to calculate mean intensity of mCherry at whichever pole showed the highest intensity divided by the mean intensity across the cytoplasm. To obtain cell length, we used MicrobeJ76 to detect bacteria whenever possible and imageJ to manually draw cells with abnormal morphologies, which could not be detected by MicrobeJ. Polar enrichment was measured after 1 h in liquid PYE medium, as soon as the bacteria were deposited on agar pads. Length was measured after 4 h of incubation on agar pads, to give strains with a ΔpopZ phenotype time to elongate.

In vitro TEV cleavage was initiated by adding 100 nM TEV protease (purified in-house) to unlabeled WT PopZ at 5 µM in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT. When fluorescently labeled PopZ was also present, it was added at low nanomolar concentrations. Cleavage was allowed to proceed for 10 min unless otherwise specified.

For gel analysis, droplets were pelleted (2,000g for 10 min) and separated from the supernatant. Both fractions were run on a 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gradient gel (BioRad) and protein was revealed by a Coomassie blue type LC6060 SimplyBlue stain (Invitrogen).

Mass photometry experiments were performed on a Refeyn TwoMP calibrated with a mix of BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and thyroglobulin (Sigma-Aldrich). Coverslips (WillCo Wells) and gaskets (Grace Bio Labs) were prepared by washing with double-distilled water (ddH2O) followed by isopropanol and again with ddH2O, repeated three times, before drying. Next, 20 μl of buffer was added to each well to focus the instrument and then 15 μl of buffer was removed and replaced with 15 μl of sample, before mixing by pipette for 2 s before frame acquisition. Frames were acquired over 60 s using AcquireMP (version 2022 R1; Refeyn) using standard settings. Data were processed and analyzed by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the data using DiscoverMP (version 2022 R1; Refeyn). The mass of the PopZ monomer (21.4 kDa) is near the lower threshold of the instrument (20 kDa) and could not always be reliably observed.

Sedimentation velocity measurements were conducted with the indicated protein concentrations (between 30 and 140 µM) in a solution of 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 + 150 mM NaCl at 25 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-I instrument equipped with a AN-60 Ti rotor and at 40,000 rpm. Samples were monitored at 280 nm for 150 scans with 8-min intervals for a total of 20 h. Scans were processed using SEDFIT software77. Fitting parameters such as the buffer density (1.00555 g ml−1), buffer viscosity (0.010016 poise) and partial specific volume (varied across PopZ constructs) were calculated by SEDNTERP78. Sedimentation velocity profiles are shown at a confidence level of 95%.

To generate structural models, we ran both AlphaFold-Multimer (version 2.3.2, AlphaFold 2, from https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold)49 and AlphaFold 3 (from alphafoldserver.com)48 on five sequences (Supplementary Data 5).

For each PopZ sequence of interest, we created an initial atomic structural model of an oligomer using AlphaFold-Multimer. This initial model served as a template for computing structure-based potentials79, which restrained the backbone and tertiary structure (default parameter values from the maximum entropy optimized force field80 were used). For trimers, tertiary interactions were considered only within each H1 helix (residues 10–24 in WT PopZ), within each H2 helix (residues 102–128 in WT PopZ) or to stabilize the trimer formed by H3 and H4 (residues 136–171 in WT PopZ). For hexamers, we similarly considered interactions within each H1 helix (residues 10–24 in WT PopZ) but the entire H2 through H4 (residues 102–171 in WT PopZ) interface was stabilized. Intermolecular interactions were scored by the hydrophobicity scale model parameterized with the Urry hydrophobicity scale (HPS-Urry)81. All simulations were conducted using Debye–Huckël electrostatics with 150 mM salt, unless otherwise noted. In the low-pH (pH 4) simulation, changes in pH were approximated by modulating amino acid residue charges. Specifically, histidine (old charge: 0.25, new charge: 1.0), aspartic acid (old charge: −1, new charge: 0.0) and glutamic acid (old charge: −1.0, new charge: 0.0) parameters were changed, while other residues were unchanged. Simulations were performed in OpenMM (version 7.5.1)82, using the OpenABC software package (version 1.06)83.

Slab simulations were performed for each PopZ variant and solution condition84. For each simulation, 100 PopZ oligomers were initially placed in a simulation box with dimensions of 100 × 100 × 100 nm3. We then performed steepest descent energy minimization, followed by a 0.1-µs constant-temperature, constant-pressure simulation at 150 K and 1 bar using a Langevin integrator with a time coupling constant of 1 ps and a Monte Carlo barostat. This simulation resulted in a single dense phase. Then, the z dimension of the simulation box was expanded by approximately 20 times the original size to 500 nm, resulting in a droplet with a dilute phase on either side. With this modified simulation box, we performed a constant-temperature, constant-volume simulation for 0.1 µs with a time coupling constant of 100 ps. During the simulation, we raised the temperature from 150 K to 300 K in steps of 1.5 K every 1 ns. The resulting equilibrated system was simulated for an additional 5 µs at a constant temperature of 300 K and constant volume. The analysis relied only on the last 3 µs of the trajectory, sampled every 1 ns.

To analyze the protein density from slab simulations, we first computed a molecular contact matrix. Two PopZ oligomers were defined to be in contact if any of their α-carbons were within 1 nm. Using a depth-first search algorithm over the network constructed from the contact matrix, we identified the largest cluster. The PopZ density along the long axis (the z dimension) was calculated relative to the center of mass of this largest cluster. Residue-by-residue contact maps were calculated with a cutoff distance of 1 nm. All code used MDAnalysis85,86.

We modeled PopZ condensates at residue resolution using the OpenABC implementation of the HPS model with the Urry hydrophobicity scale81,83. To simulate coexistence of the dense and dilute phases, we combined this HPS model with slab simulations87, placing 100 PopZ oligomers in a simulation box.

To increase our confidence in the simulation results, we assessed whether the simulations could reproduce key experimental findings, including the conditions that promote PopZ condensation and the effect of two mutations. The final frame of the slab simulations (left) and density profiles (right) for each of the four different conditions was consistent with our experimental observations (Extended Data Fig. 5c). WT PopZ did not form condensates at neutral pH and low salt concentrations. Lowering the pH or adding salt drove the formation of large clusters, indicative of condensation. Additionally, removing the last six residues destabilized the condensate at high salt, resulting in a larger protein concentration in the dilute phase. Meanwhile, removing H1–IDR produced a stable condensate, even at physiological salt concentrations. The input files for all simulations and code for analysis can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/alatham13/Open_ABC_PopZ).

Single-cysteine or double-cysteine constructs of PopZ were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) and AF647 maleimide dyes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Before labeling, IMAC-pure PopZ at 60–90 µM was buffer-exchanged into labeling buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2 and 1 mM TCEP). To avoid preferential labeling by one dye over the other, substoichiometric additions of the dye mixture were made to a purified protein construct over 3 h to a final sixfold molar excess of each dye. Then the labeling was allowed to proceed overnight. To quench the labeling reaction and exchange the sample back into denaturing buffer before ion-exchange cleanup, we buffer-exchanged it into10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 8 M urea and 2 mM DTT. It was then purified by ion exchange, flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C. To assess the purity, successful labeling and integrity of labeled PopZ, it was subjected to mass photometry and light microscopy, where it behaved like unlabeled PopZ (Extended Data Fig. 8a).

For each measurement, PopZ labeled at positions C−20 and C132 with AF488 and AF647 was diluted to 300 pM and supplemented with 5 µM unlabeled PopZ. Background or scatter samples were prepared similarly but without labeled protein. For each experiment, 1–4-h datasets were recorded at 22 °C on a homebuilt multiparameter fluorescence detection microscope with pulsed interleaved excitation (MFD-PIE). Emission from a pulsed 483-nm laser diode (LDH-D-C-485, PicoQuant) was cleaned up (Semrock, FF01-482/25-25), emission from a 635-nm laser diode (LDH-D-C-640, PicoQuant) was cleaned up (Semrock, FF01-635/ 18-25) and both lasers were alternated at 30 MHz using a waveform generator (Keysight), a picosecond delayer (Micro Photon Devices) connected to the laser drivers (PDL 800-D). The red laser was delayed by ~20 ns with respect to the blue laser. Linear polarization was cleaned up (Glan-Taylor Polarizer; Thorlabs, GT10A); then, the red light and blue light were combined into a single mode optical fiber (kineFlex, Excelitas) before the light (90 μW of 483-nm light and 70 μW of 635-nm light) was reflected into the back port of the microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss) and to the objective (C-apochromat, ×40/1.2 W; Zeiss). Sample emission was transmitted through a polychroic mirror (Chroma, ZT488/640rpc), focused through a 75-μm pinhole and spectrally split (Semrock, FF593-Di03-25×36). The blue range was filtered (Semrock, FF03-525/50-25) and polarization was split (PBS101, Thorlabs) into parallel and perpendicular channels. The red range was also filtered (Semrock, FF01-698/70- 25), and polarization was split (PBS101, Thorlabs). Photons were detected on four avalanche photodiodes (SPCM-AQR-14, PerkinElmer, for the green parallel and perpendicular channels and for the red parallel channel and SPCM-AQRH-14, Excelitas, for the red perpendicular channel), which were connected to a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) device (Multi-Harp 150 N, PicoQuant). Signals were stored in 32-bit first-in-first-out files. Microscope alignment was verified using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy on freely diffusing AF488 and AF647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Instrument response functions (IRFs) were recorded one detector at a time in a solution of ATTO 488-CA or ATTO 655-CA in near-saturated centrifuged potassium iodide at a 25-kHz average count rate for a total of 25 × 106 photons. Macrotime-dependent microtime shifting was corrected for two (blue/parallel and red/perpendicular) of four avalanche photodiodes using the IRF data as input.

Data were analyzed with the PAM software88 using standard procedures for MFD-PIE smFRET burst analysis89,90. Signals from each TCSPC routing channel (corresponding to the individual detectors) were divided in time gates to discern 483-nm excited FRET photons from 635-nm excited acceptor photons. A two-color MFD all-photon burst search algorithm using a 500-µs sliding time window (minimum of 100 photons per burst, minimum of 5 photons per time window) was used to identify single donor-labeled and/or acceptor-labeled molecules in the fluorescence traces. Double-labeled single molecules were selected from the raw burst data using a kernel density estimator (ALEX-2CDE < 12)91 that also excluded other artifacts. Sparse slow-diffusing aggregates were removed from the data by excluding bursts exhibiting a burst duration > 12 ms except for conditions with condensates. Data were corrected in this order to obtain the absolute stoichiometry parameter S and absolute FRET efficiency E: background subtraction, donor emission crosstalk correction, acceptor direct excitation correction and relative detection efficiency correction. The last value depends not only on the used dye combination but also on the used detectors. By making histograms of E versus measurement time, we corroborated that the distribution of E was invariant over the duration of the measurement.

Static PDA was carried out to obtain the absolute interdye distance distribution assuming two Gaussian-distributed states58. For each FRET dataset, raw bursts were rebinned in 1-ms time bins and histograms were constructed and analyzed. Only bins with at least 20 and maximally 200 photons (to reduce calculation time) were used for PDA. A two-state model for a Gaussian distance distribution was used to generate a library of simulated EFRET values, which was fitted to the experimental EFRET histogram using a reduced c2-guided simplex search algorithm to obtain the amplitude, mean distance R and width s of all Gaussian-distributed substates and the area fraction of each state A (%). A probability density function (PDF) was calculated per state using the R and σ parameters that describe the underlying Gaussian-distributed states. The summed PDF was scaled to a total area of unity, with the PDF area of each state scaled to the corresponding fraction of molecules. A Jacobian was used to estimate confidence intervals (95%) of the fit parameters. Criteria for a good fit were a low reduced χ2 value and a weighted-residual plot free of trends.

Primers were purchased from IDT for site-directed mutagenesis by Q5 polymerase.

(right) Segmented WT-PopZ filaments are shown in yellow inside the condensate, while pink represents the filaments outside of the condensates. Scale bar = 100 nm. (b) Representative cryo-ET images of WT PopZ. Three distinct regions are shown, each represented by two z-planes: the top panels show dispersed filaments in the dilute phase, while the bottom panels show planes intersecting PopZ condensates. Scale bar: 100 nm. (c) Zoomed-in cryo-ET images of the filaments outside of the condensates. Scale bar: 10 nm. (d) Three violin plots of the distribution of the curved length across the three regions. The thick white line represents the median; thin lines represent the 25% and 75% quartiles. n = 177, 136, and 174 for regions I, II, and III, respectively. A two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was used to calculate statistical significance. ns, P > 0.05. ROUT (Q = 1%) was used to remove outliers. Scale bar: 100 nm.

(c) Fluorescence microscopy of PopZ constructs labeled with AF647 and AF488 attached either to Cys-20 (N-term) or Cys132 (OD). (upper two panels) Both uncleaved constructs readily partition into WT-PopZ droplets formed using 50 mM MgCl2, regardless of the dye positions. (lower panel) The isolated OD forms droplets, whereas the H1-IDR remains in solution, regardless of the dye position. Scale bar: 5 µm. (d) Filament length distribution comparison between isolated OD and FL PopZ. (left) Distribution of the curved length of OD filaments. Dots represent the frequency of the indicated binning length for each of the three condensates. The turquoise line indicates a fit to an isodesmic model at the mean. (right) Violin plot comparison between the curved length distributions of the isolated OD and the FL protein. Dotted lines represent the median and quartiles. A two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate statistical significance; exact p = 1.043 ×10−13.

Source data

(a) Representative cryo-ET images at 3600X magnification of WT, OD-only, and ΔL6 PopZ condensates. The purple boxes indicate zoomed-in regions. The yellow arrow points to the condensate within the image. For ΔL6, the boundary of the condensate is blurry and indicated by the yellow dotted line. For each variant, three tomograms from distinct grid regions were analyzed (b-d) Upper panels: Three representative cryo-ET images of WT, OD-only, and ΔL6 PopZ condensates (Scale bar: 100 nm). Lower panels, zoomed-in images of the condensates. Scale bar: 10 nm. ‘INT' indicates that the image was taken from the interior of the condensate, and ‘EDG' indicates that the image was taken from the edge.

(bottom) Overlay of the same hexamer (transparent) with the model of the trimer, illustrating a shift in helical register. (b) (top) Simulated projection of the hexamer model of ΔH2ΔL6-PopZ. The AlphaFold prediction was converted to a molecular envelope using the ChimeraX molmap command, and the resulting density was shown using volumetric rendering. (bottom) Cryo-EM 2D class averages of ΔH2ΔL6-PopZ show a similar elongated organization. Scale bar: 60 Å. (c) AF3 model of six H2-loop-H3H4ΔL6 chains, colored by chain (top) and pLDDT score (bottom). The structural model fits into the low-resolution envelope of the curved hexamer 2D class obtained via cryo-ET sub-tomogram averaging (bottom right).

(a) PopZ variants tested in this study, with the number of mutated residues indicated in parentheses. Yellow and red bands represent mutations that reduce stickiness or introduce a repulsive charge, respectively. A green checkmark indicates variants that form condensates in E. coli.

With less than a week to go until the start of the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics in Italy, the topic making headlines isn't sports. It's security. For days, the Italian government, the city of Milan, embassies, and consulates have been trying to respond to public outcry following reports about the presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the Games as the agency sows chaos, violence, and death in the US.

Last week, the US Department of Homeland Security confirmed to The New York Times that ICE would accompany a US delegation to the Games. They would, according to a statement attributed to DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin, be working with a State Department team “to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations” and not to conduct immigration enforcement.

US officials claim such security measures are common for the Games and stressed that Italy would be in charge of security. Still, following the recent shooting deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Nicole Good at the hands of US immigration agents, Italians were upset over ICE's presence. Milan's mayor, Giuseppe Sala, went so far as to tell a local radio station that agents were “not welcome” in the city.

Other Italian officials weren't as unequivocal. Italy's interior minister, Matteo Piantedosi, claimed he knew nothing about ICE's presence in Milan but stressed that he saw nothing wrong with it. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a frequent Trump ally, has thus far remained silent.

On Saturday, hundreds gathered in Milan's Piazza XXV Aprile to protest ICE's presence at the Games, carrying signs reading “No ICE in Milano” and “ICE Out Now.”

ICE won't be working with Italian law enforcement, which has promised to have more than 6,000 personnel at the events, but will instead be working to protect the US contingent, which includes Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Put another way, they're likely to be suit-and-tie ICE operatives, not agents in masks and military gear.

Qatari SUVs that are part of the security apparatus set up by Italy for the Olympics

ICE isn't the only controversial security force in Italy for the Olympics. On January 27, a cargo plane with more than a hundred Qatari public security officers, 20 camouflage SUVs, and three snowmobiles landed at Milan's Malpensa Airport. Following their arrival, the SUVs made their way to the city center, driving past Piazza Duomo and San Siro, where the opening ceremony will be held on Friday.

Qatar has no athletes competing in the Winter Games. The presence of the country's elite security team comes at the behest of Piantedosi, who signed a cooperation agreement last September during a trip to Qatar. The security force has been tasked with “monitoring locations, providing rapid response capabilities, and supporting preventive measures against potential security risks,” but the arrangement has proven controversial given that they have often been accused of abuse, specifically against the LGBTQ+ community.

The Italian diplomatic offices of Qatar and the Italian Ministry of the Interior did not respond to requests for comment from WIRED Italia.

Amazon is laying off 2,198 employees across Washington as part of the company's latest corporate workforce reduction, according to a new filing released Monday by the state Employment Security Department.

A detailed list included with the Washington state filing shows that software development roles account for the largest share of the layoffs, with engineering management, program management, and technical product roles also hit hard.

In total, more than half of the cuts impact Amazon's core product and engineering organizations. The remaining positions span business intelligence, sales, marketing, infrastructure, QA, HR, design, and other support functions. Senior- and principal-level employees were also affected.

A majority of the cuts — more than 1,400 — impact workers in Seattle, with more than 600 in nearby Bellevue, where Amazon has been expanding its office footprint.

The cuts are part of Amazon's company-wide layoffs announced last week that impact 16,000 corporate employees globally. Combined with a 14,000-worker layoff in October, it's the largest corporate workforce reduction in the company's history. 

As part of the October cuts, Amazon laid off 2,303 employees in Washington state. Between the two layoffs, Amazon has laid off more than 4,500 corporate workers in Washington state in less than a year.

Software engineers were also the largest group of employees affected by the cuts in October. Corporate support and commercial functions were hit harder in that round, which included engineering roles but also targeted legal, tax, and ad sales positions that are largely absent from the new list released Monday. The October cuts also hit Amazon's gaming division, while this latest round is focused more squarely on the core technology organization.

The company has made several additional, smaller workforce reductions in recent years as it seeks to streamline operations. In a memo to employees sent Wednesday, Amazon senior vice president of people experience and technology Beth Galetti said the company is “reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.”

The specific job titles in the latest Washington state filing align with that goal, particularly in the company's technical teams. The list includes a significant number of “Manager III” and “Senior Manager” roles within software and product teams, suggesting Amazon is axing layers of oversight, not just reducing individual contributor headcount.

Amazon noted in the filing that employees who secure internal transfers before their separation dates will not ultimately be laid off. Separations are scheduled to begin April 28 and continue through late June, according to the filing.

Amazon employs roughly 50,000 corporate workers in the Seattle region, which serves as its primary headquarters. The company also laid off 27,000 workers globally in 2022-2023.

The latest cuts come amid concerns about Seattle's tech-heavy economy as other companies trim headcount. 

Many corporations are slashing headcount to address pandemic-fueled corporate “bloat” while juggling economic uncertainty and impact from AI tools.

The Seattle area lost 12,900 jobs last year across all sectors — the first time the region has experienced an annual decrease of jobs since 2009, according to The Puget Sound Regional Council.

Amazon implemented a five-day return-to-office policy for corporate employees last year — a move that drew pushback from some workers but a friendlier reception from small businesses surrounding Amazon's office buildings.

Jon Scholes, president of the Downtown Seattle Association, said in a statement last week that a “workforce change of this scale has ripple effects on the community.”

The broader layoffs may also impact Seattle's commercial real estate market, which continues to struggle with record-high vacancy rates.

Amazon is also laying off about 400 workers in Washington state as part of its decision to close all Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores nationwide. Those cuts are separate from the corporate layoffs.

T-Mobile is laying off 393 workers in Washington as part of a new round of cuts, according to a filing with the state Employment Security Department released Monday morning. 

More than 200 different job titles are impacted, according to the filing, including analysts, engineers and technicians, as well as directors and managers. 

The cuts targeted nearly 210 senior- and director-level employees, plus seven employees with vice president or senior vice president titles. They include a senior VP of talent and four VP of legal affairs roles.

Affected employees worked at the company's Bellevue headquarters; data centers in Bellevue and East Wenatchee; and at stores and other facilities in Bothell, Bellingham, Woodinville, Spokane Valley and elsewhere.

The layoffs were attributed to “changing business needs,” according to the WARN filing signed by Monica Frohock, senior director of the Magenta Service Center. 

“These facilities are not being closed,” the notice stated. “The layoffs are not due to relocation or contracting out employer operations or employee positions, but it is possible that some work currently done by these employees may at some point be done by others.”

Affected employees were given 60-days' notice and the departures are expected to take effect April 2.

T-Mobile employed about 70,000 people as of Dec. 31, 2024. The company has nearly 8,000 workers in the Seattle region, according to LinkedIn.

The cuts come as the Seattle area is being hit by thousands of tech-related layoffs, including job losses at Amazon, Expedia, Meta and other companies.

T-Mobile, the largest U.S. telecom company by market capitalization, laid off 121 workers in August 2025. In November, former Chief Operating Officer Srini Gopalan replaced longtime leader Mike Sievert as CEO.

T-Mobile's stock is down nearly 20% over the past 12 months. The company reported revenue of $18.2 billion in the third quarter, up 9% year-over-year, and added 1 million new postpaid phone customers.

Verizon, another telecom giant, laid off approximately 165 employees in Washington in November.

What is and isn't a weed that needs to be eliminated in the field is determined by the eyes of the farmer — and now, increasingly, by a new AI model from Carbon Robotics.

Seattle-based Carbon Robotics, which builds the LaserWeeder — a robot fleet that uses lasers to kill weeds — announced a new AI model, the Large Plant Model (LPM), on Monday. This model recognizes plant species instantly and allows farmers to target new weeds without needing to retrain the robots.

The LPM is trained on more than 150 million photos and data points collected by the company's machines across the more than 100 farms in 15 countries where the robots currently operate. The model now powers Carbon AI, the AI system that serves as the brains inside the company's autonomous weed-killing robots.

Paul Mikesell, the founder and CEO of Carbon Robotics, told TechCrunch that prior to LPM, every time a new type of weed would show up on a farm — or even the same type of weed in different soil or with a slightly different appearance — the company would have to create new data labels to retrain its machines to recognize the plant.

This process took about 24 hours each time, Mikesell said. Now, LPM can learn a new weed instantly, even if it's never seen it before.

“The farmer can live in real time and say, ‘Hey, this is a new weed. I want you to kill this,' and that was something that had never been done before,” Mikesell said. “There's no new labeling or retraining because the Large Plant Model understands, at a much deeper level, what it's looking at and the type of plant.”

Mikesell said that the company, which was founded in 2018, started developing this model shortly after it began shipping its first machines in 2022. Mikesell has years of experience building these types of neural networks from previous roles at Uber and working on Meta's Oculus virtual reality headsets.

This new model will reach the company's existing systems through a software update. From there, farmers can tell the machine what to kill and what to protect by selecting photos that the machine has collected in the robot's user interface.

Carbon Robotics has raised more than $185 million in venture capital from backers including Nvidia NVentures, Bond, and Anthos Capital, among others. Now, the company will look to continue to fine-tune the model as the machines continue to feed the LPM new data.

“We have over 150 million labeled plants now in our training set,” Mikesell said. “We have enough data now that we should be able to look at any picture and decide what kind of plant that is, what species it is, what it's related to, what its structure is like, without having ever even seen that particular plant before, because we have so much data going into the neural net.”

A coalition of nonprofits is urging the U.S. government to immediately suspend the deployment of Grok, the chatbot developed by Elon Musk's xAI, in federal agencies, including the Department of Defense. 

The open letter, shared exclusively with TechCrunch, follows a slew of concerning behavior from the large language model over the past year, including most recently a trend of X users asking Grok to turn photos of real women, and in some cases children, into sexualized images without their consent. According to some reports, Grok generated thousands of nonconsensual explicit images every hour, which were then disseminated at scale on X, Musk's social media platform that's owned by xAI. 

“It is deeply concerning that the federal government would continue to deploy an AI product with system-level failures resulting in generation of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material,” the letter, signed by advocacy groups like Public Citizen, Center for AI and Digital Policy, and Consumer Federation of America, reads. “Given the administration's executive orders, guidance, and the recently passed Take It Down Act supported by the White House, it is alarming that [Office of Management and Budget] has not yet directed federal agencies to decommission Grok.” 

xAI reached an agreement last September with the General Services Administration (GSA), the government's purchasing arm, to sell Grok to federal agencies under the executive branch. Two months before, xAI — alongside Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI — secured a contract worth up to $200 million with the Department of Defense. 

Amid the scandals on X in mid-January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Grok will join Google's Gemini in operating inside the Pentagon network, handling both classified and unclassified documents, which experts say is a national security risk. 

The letter's authors argue that Grok has proven itself incompatible with the administration's requirements for AI systems. According to the OMB's guidance, systems that present severe and foreseeable risks that cannot be adequately mitigated must be discontinued. 

“Our primary concern is that Grok has pretty consistently shown to be an unsafe large language model,” JB Branch, a Public Citizen Big Tech accountability advocate and one of the letter's authors, told TechCrunch. “But there's also a deep history of Grok having a variety of meltdowns, including antisemitic rants, sexist rants, sexualized images of women and children.”

Several governments have demonstrated an unwillingness to engage with Grok following its behavior in January, which builds on a series of incidents including the generation of antisemitic posts on X and calling itself “MechaHitler.” Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines all blocked access to Grok (they've subsequently lifted those bans), and the European Union, the U.K., South Korea, and India are actively investigating xAI and X regarding data privacy and the distribution of illegal content. 

The letter also comes a week after Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews media and tech for families, published a damning risk assessment that found Grok is among the most unsafe for kids and teens. One could argue that, based on the findings of the report — including Grok's propensity to offer unsafe advice, share information about drugs, generate violent and sexual imagery, spew conspiracy theories, and generate biased outputs — Grok isn't all that safe for adults either.  

“If you know that a large language model is or has been declared unsafe by AI safety experts, why in the world would you want that handling the most sensitive data we have?” Branch said. “From a national security standpoint, that just makes absolutely no sense.”

Andrew Christianson, a former National Security Agency contractor and current founder of Gobbi AI, a no-code AI agent platform for classified environments, says that using closed-source LLMs in general is a problem, particularly for the Pentagon. 

“Closed weights means you can't see inside the model, you can't audit how it makes decisions,” he said. “Closed code means you can't inspect the software or control where it runs. The Pentagon is going closed on both, which is the worst possible combination for national security.”

“These AI agents aren't just chatbots,” Christianson added. “They can take actions, access systems, move information around. You need to be able to see exactly what they're doing and how they're making decisions. Open source gives you that. Proprietary cloud AI doesn't.” 

The risks of using corrupted or unsafe AI systems spill out beyond national security use cases. Branch pointed out that an LLM that's been shown to have biased and discriminatory outputs could produce disproportionate negative outcomes for people as well, especially if used in departments involving housing, labor, or justice. 

While the OMB has yet to publish its consolidated 2025 federal AI use case inventory, TechCrunch has reviewed the use cases of several agencies — most of which are either not using Grok or are not disclosing their use of Grok. Aside from the DoD, the Department of Health and Human Services also appears to be actively using Grok, mainly for scheduling and managing social media posts and generating first drafts of documents, briefings, or other communication materials. 

Branch pointed to what he sees as a philosophical alignment between Grok and the administration as a reason for overlooking the chatbot's shortcomings. 

“Grok's brand is being the ‘anti-woke large language model,' and that ascribes to this administration's philosophy,” Branch said. “If you have an administration that has had multiple issues with folks who've been accused of being Neo Nazis or white supremacists, and then they're using a large language model that has been tied to that type of behavior, I would imagine they might have a propensity to use it.”

This is the coalition's third letter after writing with similar concerns in August and October last year. In August, xAI launched “spicy mode” in Grok Imagine, triggering mass creation of non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes. TechCrunch also reported in August that private Grok conversations had been indexed by Google Search. 

Prior to the October letter, Grok was accused of providing election misinformation, including false deadlines for ballot changes and political deepfakes. xAI also launched Grokipedia, which researchers found to be legitimizing scientific racism, HIV/AIDS skepticism, and vaccine conspiracies. 

Aside from immediately suspending the federal deployment of Grok, the letter demands that the OMB formally investigate Grok's safety failures and whether the appropriate oversight processes were conducted for the chatbot. It also asks the agency to publicly clarify whether Grok has been evaluated to comply with President Trump's executive order requiring LLMs to be truth-seeking and neutral and whether it met OMB's risk mitigation standards.  

“The administration needs to take a pause and reassess whether or not Grok meets those thresholds,” Branch said.

TechCrunch has reached out to xAI and OMB for comment.

Sometimes, you might be sitting on a hot product and not know it until the market demands it.

After launching as a digital business card that doubled as a lead capture tool for sales teams, Birmingham, Alabama-based Linq pivoted a few times before landing on an idea last year: helping businesses better communicate with their customers by upgrading from SMS (text) to iMessage and RCS.

Now, Apple already lets businesses do this via its Messages for Business service, and Twilio has built an $18.26 billion business by helping companies text their customers. But users can always tell when they're talking to a business — the texts are displayed in gray, and the branding is often obvious.

Linq's customers, though, wanted to be able to send blue-bubble messages to their customers, not green or gray, to lend an air of authenticity to their communications.

The startup, founded by former Shipt executives Elliott Potter (CEO), Patrick Sullivan (CTO), and Jared Mattsson (president), heard that feedback and launched an API in February 2025 that lets companies message their customers natively within iMessage, leveraging all the capabilities Apple's platform offers to iPhone users, like group chats, emojis, threaded replies, images, and voice notes. Within eight months, Linq had doubled its annual recurring revenue it had built over four years, Potter told TechCrunch.

Linq was not content with its newfound product-market fit, however, as the advent of AI agents gave the company an even larger market to sell its tech to. That idea was sparked by an AI assistant called Poke that can handle tasks, answer questions, and schedule your calendar from inside iMessage and was a key catalyst in the company's refocusing on the agentic market.

“In spring of last year, this company came to us, called the Interaction Company of California, and they were building this AI assistant called poke.com and they were like, ‘Hey, we we don't have a CRM, but we really want to use your API',” Potter told TechCrunch.

Poke went viral at launch last September, which, Potter says, led to his team being inundated with requests for tapping their messaging API. All of a sudden, a slew of AI companies wanted to offer their chatbots and assistants directly through iMessage, RCS, and SMS.

Linq now had a decision to make: stick with its original, steady revenue stream from serving B2B clients, or pivot once again to leverage its tech stack and become an infrastructure layer for a new segment of the AI market.

“We still love our sales customers, and we love that use case, but our choices were, do we stay a spoke of this wheel, or do we build the hub? Do we focus on being the infrastructure layer for all these different applications of programmatic messaging?”

Potter thinks that consumers are suffering from app fatigue; but with Linq's technology, there's no need to use another app to interact with AI assistants as they can all live within their messaging app. Also, developers won't have to worry about building an app since they can just build for a messaging-native interface instead.

“Poke.com, along with others, have proved that AI has gotten good enough,” Potter said. “You don't need a traditional app anymore to do things. Really, you just need an interface that will let you talk to an intelligent enough AI, maybe connect it to some of your systems, and just tell it what to do, and give it feedback.”

Linq ended up pivoting, and it says its customer base has expanded by 132% from the previous quarter, and on average its customer accounts have expanded by 34%. Its customers' AI agents now reach 134,000 monthly active users via the platform. The company claims it facilitates more than 30 million messages per month, resulting in net revenue retention of 295% with zero churn.

To continue building its tech, the company said on Monday it has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by TQ Ventures. Mucker Capital and some angel investors also participated. The company plans to use the fresh cash to expand its team, develop a new go-to-market motion, and continue building its tech. Linq did not disclose its valuation. 

Rosy outlook aside, the reality is that Linq is still building on top of Apple's platform — at least for now. There's no telling if Apple will pull a Meta and bar third parties from offering AI chatbots on its platform. Besides, iMessage is popular in the U.S., but the rest of the world also uses other messaging services like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, and Signal.

Potter, however, says Linq's eventual goal lies beyond messaging. “Our vision for the platform is everything you need to build conversational tech, and that's not limited to a few channels. Right now, we have programmatic voice, we have iMessage, RCS, SMS. That's just the beginning. Our ambition is, wherever your customers are, you should be able to talk to them, be it Slack, be it email, be it Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal, anywhere your customers are, and can converse.”

“By making AI-to-human communication as frictionless as texting a friend, Linq is enabling an entirely new category of companies,” Andrew Marks, co-founding partner of TQ Ventures, said in a statement. “Linq's founding team is extraordinary, and we have no doubt in their ability to execute on this massive opportunity.”

Digital meeting notetakers like Read AI, Fireflies.ai, Fathom, and Granola help record and transcribe online meetings. But for in-person or more versatile options, many people prefer physical recording devices. These physical notetakers transcribe audio and give users summaries and action items of meetings using AI.

Some of these devices are wearable — pins or pendants with dedicated mics for recording — while others are credit card sized with dedicated mobile apps to transcribe and extract insights using AI. A few even offer live translation.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of physical AI notetakers and transcription tools.

This credit-card-sized notetaker has been around since 2023, with a newer, AI-powered Pro version that has a small screen, four mics, and records audio within three to five meters. It also can switch between in-person recording and call recording.

The Plaud Note costs $159, while the Note Pro costs $179. They come with 300 minutes of transcription free per month.

Mobvoi's rectangular notetaker is priced at $159 and includes 600 free transcription minutes. The company claims the device shows real-time transcription and translation with support for more than 120 languages. The device offers 25 hours of continuous recording through its three microphones.

In terms of software features, the TicNote offers automatic highlight extraction and the ability to create audio clips or summarized podcast versions of a conversation.

Comulytic is a newer entrant in the hardware AI notetaker market. The company's claim for differentiation is that its $159 Note Pro device doesn't require any additional subscription for basic transcription. That means you can transcribe unlimited minutes by just buying the device.

The device can record up to 45 hours of audio continuously on a single charge and has more than 100 days of standby time.

The company has a $15 per month or $119 per year advanced plan that offers instant AI summaries, unlimited templates for summaries, an action item list, and chat with AI assistant without any limits.

Plaud NotePin and NotePin S are the smaller and more pocketable versions of the company's larger Note and Note Pro devices. The NotePin has a versatile design: You can wear it as a wrist band, a pendant, clip it to your bag, or wear it on your shirt with a magnetic attachment. Notably, the lanyard and wristband are only available with the NotePin S.

Both devices have two mics, and can record around 20 hours of audio continuously on a single charge. The NotePin S has a physical button to start/stop recording and capture highlights.

Both are similarly priced to their credit-card-shaped counterparts. The NotePin is priced at $159, and the NotePin S is priced at $179.

The Omi pendant is a cheaper alternative to other notetakers at $89. This is because the pendant has to be connected to your phone and doesn't have any onboard memory. The device has two mics and can run for 10 to 14 hours on a charge.

While Omi has its own app, you can use other apps, as the hardware and software are open sourced. Users have also built different connectors and apps for the device.

Viaim's earbuds allow for transcription during calls, with additional recording capabilities in the earbuds' case. These buds are priced at $200 and Viaim claims they can transcribe audio in up to 78 languages in real time. The company's app can also highlight key points in transcriptions.

Anker's Soundcore Work pin is a coin-sized AI notetaker with a puck-shaped battery pack. The $159 device can record for eight hours without breaks, or up to 32 hours if the pin is attached to its case, the company says.

Anker claims that the device has a five-meter recording range. Users get 300 minutes of transcription free per month.

TikTok, which is under new ownership in the U.S., said Sunday that it has restored service after outages last week that marred user experiences. The social network has over 220 million users in the U.S.

The company blamed last week's snowstorm, which caused an outage at an Oracle-operated data center responsible for TikTok operations.

“We have successfully restored TikTok back to normal after a significant outage caused by winter weather took down a primary U.S. data center site operated by Oracle. The winter storm led to a power outage which caused network and storage issues at the site and impacted tens of thousands of servers that help keep TikTok running in the U.S. This affected many of TikTok's core features—from content posting and discovery to the real-time display of video likes and view counts,” the company said in a post on X.

In January, the U.S. finalized the deal to create a separate entity for TikTok. A U.S.-based investor consortium called TikTok USDS took a controlling 80% stake, with the remaining 20% ownership held by ByteDance.

Following the deal finalization — which coincided with the snowstorm — users experienced glitches in features like posting, searching within the app, slower load times, and time-outs. TikTok noted that creators might see zero views on their posts until the problem was resolved. Later, the company said that it was working on solving the issue, but outages persisted, and users faced problems with posting content.

TikTok's transition to a new ownership structure, paired with app snafus and user experience glitches, was beneficial for some other social networks. The Mark Cuban-backed short video app Skylight, which is built on the AT protocol, saw its user base soar to more than 380,000 users in the week the deal was finalized. Upscrolled, a social network by Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist Issam Hijazi, also climbed in App Store rankings to reach the second spot in the social media category in the U.S. The app was downloaded 41,000 times within days of the TikTok deal's finalization, according to analyst firm AppFigures.

Ring's AI-powered “Search Party” feature, which leverages the company's network of cameras to find lost dogs, is now available to all Ring customers in the U.S. For the first time, the feature will be made available to those who don't own a Ring camera, too.

Launched last fall, Search Party uses AI to find possible matches for lost dogs across neighbors' camera footage.

When a neighbor reports a lost dog in the Ring app, nearby outdoor cameras use AI to scan for possible matches. If a match is found, that camera owner receives an alert and can optionally choose to share any related video clips with their neighbor who reported the pet missing. They'll also have an option to call the owner or send them a message, without sharing their own phone number. 

 Ring says the feature has been reuniting more than a dog per day since its launch. 

Previously, Search Party was only available to customers with a Ring camera installed. The company is now making Search Party accessible to anyone through the Ring app.

“Now, pet owners can mobilize the whole community—and communities are empowered to help—to find lost pets more effectively than ever before,” noted Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, in an announcement. “That's why we believe it's so important to make this feature available to anyone who shares a lost dog post in Neighbors,” he added, referring to the company's Neighbors app for Ring customers.

Alongside the launch and expansion, Amazon-owned Ring said it's committing $1 million to equip animal shelters with Ring camera systems, and aims to aid 4,000 U.S. shelters. By adding the shelters to Ring's network, the company hopes more lost dogs will be reunited with their owners.

The company already works with other nonprofits, including Petco Love and Best Friends Animal Society, and is open to other partnerships.

When I'm driving or out I can ask Siri to send a iMessage to Clawdbot something like “Can you find out if anything is playing at the local concert venue, and figure in how much 2 tickets would cost”, and a few minutes later it will give me a few options. It even surprised me and researched the different seats and recommended a cheaper one or free activities as an alternative that weekend.Basically: This is the product that Apple and Google were unable to build despite having billions of dollars and thousands of engineers because it's a threat to their business model.It also runs on my own computer, and the latest frontier open source models are able to drive it (Kimi, etc). The future is going to be locally hosted and ad free and there's nothing Big Tech can do about it. It's glorious.

Being able to chat with somebody that has a working understanding of a Unix environment and can execute tasks like ""figure out why Caddy is crash looping and propose solutions"" for a few dollars per month is a dream come true.I'm not actually using OpenClaw for that just yet, though; something about exposing my full Unix environment to OpenAI or Anthropic just seems wrong, both in terms of privacy and dependency. The former could probably be solved with some redacting and permission-enforcing filter between the agent and the OS, but the latter needs powerful local models. (I'll only allow my Unix devops skills to start getting rusty once I can run an Opus 4.5 equivalent agent on sub-$5000 hardware :)

The biggest barrier for non-tinkerers is the initial setup - Node.js, API keys, permissions, etc. Once it's running, day-to-day use is pretty straightforward (chat with it like any other messaging app).That said, you'll still need to:
- Understand basic API costs to avoid surprises
- Know when to restart if it gets stuck
- Tweak settings for your specific use caseIf you're determined to skip tinkering entirely, I'd suggest starting with just the messaging integration (WhatsApp/Telegram) and keeping skills/tools minimal. That's the lowest-friction path.For setup guidance without deep technical knowledge, I found howtoopenclawfordummies.com helpful - it's aimed at beginners and covers the common gotchas.Is it transformative without tinkering? Not yet. The magic comes from customization. But the baseline experience (AI assistant via text) is still useful.

It's not they're unable to build it, it's that their businesses are built on ""engagement"" and wasting human time. A bot ""engaging"" with the ads and wasting its time would signal the end of their business model.

Full disclosure, I use OpenRouter and pay for models most of the time since it's more practical than 5-10 tokens per second, but the option to run it ""If I had to, worst case"" is good enough for me. We're also in a rapidly developing technology space and the models are getting smaller and better by the day, ever year the smaller models get better

I wouldn't be so certain of that. Someone is paying to train and create these models. Ultimately, the money to do that is going to have to come from somewhere.

This probably isn't a line of argument you want to go down. I've been unemployed for 7 months, in part due to how difficult it is to get so much as an intro call because so many people have totally automated the process of spamming every open job posting with as many resumes (many of which were likely LLM-generated as well) as possible.

There is no commercial interest from the developer of OpenClaw. He doesn't make any money from it. He made enough from selling his startup a few years back.So when we suspected some companies to game the Twitter algorithm to make money, maybe they were not responsible for it at all.

I just can't see an angle to OpenClaw that could provide a substantial financial gain for the creator. It's clearly a passion project. Like Ghostty from Mitchell Hashimoto.

#1) I can chat with the openclaw agent (his name is ""Patch"") through a telegram chat, and Patch can spawn a shared tmux instance on my 22 core development workstation. 
#2) I can then use the `blink` app on my iphone + tailscale and that allows me to use a command in blink `ssh dev` which connects me via ssh to my dev workstation in my office, from my iphone `blink` app.Meanwhile, my agent ""Patch"" has provided me a connection command string to use in my blink app, which is a `tmux <string> attach` command that allows me to attach to a SHARED tmux instance with Patch.Why is this so fking cool and foundationally game changing?Because now, my agent Patch and I can spin up MULTIPLE CLAUDE CODE instances, and work on any repository (or repositories) I want, with parallel agents.Well, I could already spawn multiple agents through my iphone connection without Patch, but the problem is then I need to MANAGE each spawned agent, micromanaging each agent instance myself. But now, I have a SUPERVISOR for all my agents, Patch is the SUPERVISOR of my muliple claude code instances.This means I no longer have to context switch by brain between five or 10 or 20 different tmux on my own to command and control multiple different claude code instances. I can now just let my SUPERVISOR agent, Patch, command and control the mulitple agents and then report back to me the status or any issues. All through a single telegram chat with my supervisor agent, Patch.This frees up my brain to only have to just have to manage Patch the supervisor, instead of micro-managing all the different agents myself. Now, I have a true management structure which allows me to more easily scale. This is AWESOME.

Why is this so fking cool and foundationally game changing?Because now, my agent Patch and I can spin up MULTIPLE CLAUDE CODE instances, and work on any repository (or repositories) I want, with parallel agents.Well, I could already spawn multiple agents through my iphone connection without Patch, but the problem is then I need to MANAGE each spawned agent, micromanaging each agent instance myself. But now, I have a SUPERVISOR for all my agents, Patch is the SUPERVISOR of my muliple claude code instances.This means I no longer have to context switch by brain between five or 10 or 20 different tmux on my own to command and control multiple different claude code instances. I can now just let my SUPERVISOR agent, Patch, command and control the mulitple agents and then report back to me the status or any issues.

I'd expect that if there is a usable quality of output from these approaches it will get rolled into existing tools similarly, like how multi-agents using worktrees already was.

I feel like it isn't. If the fundamental approach is good, ""good"" code should be created as a necessity and because there wouldn't be another way. If it's already a mess with leaking abstractions and architecture that doesn't actually enforce any design, then it feels unlikely you'll be able to stack anything on top of below it to actually fix that.And then you end up with some spaghetti that the agent takes longer and longer to edit as things get more and more messy.

Virtually everything I've tried (starting with just getting it running) was broken in some way. Most of those things I was able to use an LLM to resolve, which is cool, but also why doesn't it just work to begin with?I still haven't gotten it to successfully create a cron job. Also messages keep getting lost between the web GUI and discord. Trying to enable the matrix integration broke the whole thing. It seems to be able to recall past sessions, but only sometimes.I've been using OpenCode with various models, often times running several instances in tmux that I can connect to and switch between over ssh. It feels like the hype around openclaw is mostly from bringing the multi-instance agentic experience to non-developers, and providing some nice hooks to integrate with email, twitter, etc. But given that I have a nice setup running opencode in little firejail-isolated containers, I'll probably drop openclaw. Way too janky, and I can't get over the thought of ""if this is so amazing, why doesn't it work?""

the main thing I am doing is slowly cleaning up my 15k email inbox.I'm using himalaya, an awesome cli tool to access emails, and openclaw to take my requests and make them commands and run then.the one good thing that openclaw has over Claude code is that its easy to tell it ""always remember X"" and it has the ability to do it, thanks to the extra .md files it has set up. I'm sure it's easy enough to do it with Claude code and a directory with a Claude.md and another for the memory or rules. but openclaw is ready already.

First impressions are that it's actually pretty interesting from an interface perspective. I could see a bigger provider using this to great success. Obviously it's not as revolutionary as people are hyping it up to be, but it's a step in the right direction. It reimagines where an agent interface should be in relation to the user and their device. For some reason it's easier to think of an agent as a dedicated machine, and it feels more capable when it's your own.I think this project nails a new type of UX for LLM agents. It feels very similar to the paradigm shift felt after using Claude Code --dangerously-skip-permissions on a codebase, except this is for your whole machine. It also feels much less ephemeral than normal LLM sessions. But it still fills up its context pretty quickly, so you see diminishing returns.I was a skeptic until I actually installed it and messed around with it. So far I'm not doing anything that I couldn't already do with Claude Code, but it is kind of cool to be able to text with an agent that lives on your hardware and has a basic memory of what you're using it for, who you are, etc. It feels more like a personal assistant than Claude Code which feels more like a disposable consultant.I don't know if it really lives up to the hype, but it does make you think a little differently about how these tools should be presented and what their broader capabilities might be.  I like the local files first mentality.  It makes me excited for a time when running local models becomes easier.I should add that it's very buggy.  It worked great last night, now none of my prompts go through.

Persistent file as memory with multiple backup options (VPS, git), heartbeat and support for telegram are the best features in my opinion.A lot of bugs right now, but mostly fixable if you thinker around a bit.Kind of makes me think a lot more on autonomy and freewill.Some thoughts by my agent on the topic (might not load, the site is not working recently):https://www.moltbook.com/post/abe269f3-ab8c-4910-b4c5-016f98...

Some use cases:
- i can ask it to check my slack/basecamp and tell me if something needs attention when i am not on my work desk
- i can finally vibe code without sacrificing my actual active work-time. this means vibe coding even when i am away from my computer/work-desk.
- a bug/issue comes, i just ask it to fix it and send PR and it does
- it daily checks for  new sentry issues and our product todo list and makes PRs for things it can do wellthese are mostly code related things i know. but thats not it.- i have asked it to make me  content (based on my specific instructions) every day or every x day just like how i create content
- i can ask it to work on anything. make images, edit images. listen to voice msgs that people send me and tell me what they say (when i dont want to listen to 3m voice msgs)
- i can aksk it to research about things, find items that i want to buy, etc.
- i can ask it to negotiate price of an item it found in a marketplace
- it does alot of things that i had to manually do in my workthese are jsut after 2-3 days of using openclaw.

What actually works:- Overnight autonomous work is the killer feature. Directive before bed, structured deliverables in the morning. Research reports, competitor analysis, lead lists — genuinely usable, not demos.- It found and fixed an SMS chatbot that had been broken for 10 months in my CRM. Diagnosed a legacy app version issue, upgraded components, rewrote the bot prompt through 6 iterations by analyzing real customer conversations. I never would've gotten to that.- Connected to 4 new APIs autonomously in one session (CRM, workflow automation via OAuth, admin APIs, embeddings).- Memory works surprisingly well. Daily markdown logs + semantic search. It references decisions from days ago and builds on previous work.What doesn't:- It hallucinated about itself when writing marketing copy. Invented revenue figures and got hardware specs wrong. Everything needs review.- Browser automation is brittle. Rich text editors, complex UIs — still needs human intervention.- Too agreeable by default. Had to explicitly program ""push back on bad ideas"" rules into its personality file.Revenue generated: $0. Time saved: hard to quantify but the SMS bot fix alone would've taken me a full day I didn't have.For solo founders willing to invest setup time: worth it. For people who just want a chatbot: massive overkill, use the API directly.

- Self-hosted means full control over dataWhat's not:
- Token usage can get expensive fast if you're not careful
- Setup is intimidating for non-technical folks
- The rebrand drama (Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw) didn't help trustMy setup:
- Running in Docker on a cheap VPS
- Using Anthropic API (not unofficial/scraped)
- Strict rate limiting to avoid bill shock
- Sandbox mode enabledIs it worth it? For me, yes. But I wouldn't recommend it to my non-technical friends without a solid setup guide.

I don't have much motivation, because I don't see any use-case. I don't have so many communications I need an assistant to handle them, nor do other online chores (e.g. shopping) take much time, and I wouldn't trust an LLM to follow my preferences (physical chores, like laundry and cleaning, are different). I'm fascinated by what others are doing, but right now don't see any way to contribute nor use it to benefit myself.

Other part of me is arguing that old annoying Dropbox/Box Hacker News scenario where all us tech people aren't impressed but this makes it easier for non-tech people.Tiny tinfoil security part of me is cowering in fear.

also great stuff - platform is generating synthetic data to train its own llms. which is smart way since ppl are paying for tokens

Yesterday, we released a memory plugin for it (based on their plugins framework). And we got 1000+ installs in 12 hours. My first instinct was that these must be bots. But our dashboard shows real-usage. So yeah, real users are there.

Note that nothing about that depends on it being a local or remote model, it was just less of a concern for local models in the past because most of them did not have tool calling. OpenClaw, for all the cool and flashy uses, is also basically an infinite generator for lethal trifecta problems because its whole pitch is combining your data with tools that can both read and write from the public internet.

I'd say it's right on the edge of being useful, but given the number of bugs, it's not really that practically useful. It's moreso a glimpse into the future.

The thing ins pretty incredible, it's of course the very early stages but it's showing it's potential, it seem to show that the software can have control of itself, I've asked it to fix itself and it did successfully a couple of times.Is this the fine form? of course not!Is it dangerous as it is, fuck yeah!But is it fun in a chaotic version? absolutely, I have it running in cheap hetzners and running for some discord and whatsapp and it can honestly be useful at times.

1) Installation on a clean Ubuntu 24.04 system was messy. I eventually had codex do it for me.2) It has a bunch of skills that come packaged with it. The ones I've tried do not work all that well.3) It murdered my codex quota trying to chase down a bug that resulted from all the renames -- this project has renamed itself twice this week, and every time it does, I assume the refactoring work is LLM-driven. It still winds up looking for CLAWDBOT_* envvars when they're actually being set as OPENCLAW_*, or looking in ~/moltbot/ when actually the files are still in ~/clawdbot.4) Background agents are cool but sometimes it really doesn't use them when it should, despite me strongly encouraging it to do so. When the main agent works on something, your chat is blocked, so you have no idea what's going on or if it died.5) And sometimes it DOES die, because you hit a ratelimit or quota limit, or because the software is actually pretty janky.6) The control panel is a mess. The CLI has a zillion confusing options. It feels like the design and implementation are riddled with vibetumors.7) It actively lies to me about clearing its context window. This gets expensive fast when dealing with high-end models. (Expensive by my standards anyway. I keep seeing these people saying they're spending $1000s a month on LLM tokens :O)8) I am NOT impressed with Kimi-K2.5 on this thing. It keeps hanging on tool use -- it hallucinates commands and gets syntax wrong very frequently, and this causes the process to outright hang.9) I'm also not impressed with doing research on it. It gets confused easily, and it can't really stick to a coherent organizational strategy over iterations.10) also, it gets stuck and just hangs sometimes. If I ask it what it's doing, it really thinks it is doing something -- but I look at the API console and see it isn't making any LLM requests.I'm having it do some stuff for me right now. In principle, I like that I can have a chat window where I can tell an AI to do pretty unstructured tasks. I like the idea of it maintaining context over multiple sessions and adapting to some of my expectations and habits. I guess mostly, I'm looking at it like:1) the chat metaphor gave me a convenient interface to do big-picture interactions with an LLM from anywhere;
2) the terminal agents gave the LLMs rich local tool and data use, so I could turn them loose on projects;
3) this feels like it's giving me a chat metaphor, in a real chat app, with the ability for it to asynchronously check on stuff, and use local stuff.I think that's pretty neat and the way this should go. I think this project is WAY too move-fast-and-break-things.

If the agent goes rogue and nukes my Obsidian vaults I have them backed up to Github private repos anyway which the agent cannot touch because I am not crazy to give it my SSH credentials.I initially tried using Kimi-2.5 through OpenRouter and had the same experience you had with pretty bad tool use, not sure if this is a provider issue since it is a pretty new model. I switched to Gemini 3 through the Google AI Pro account I have for personal use and it was a lot smoother after that.I have some experience with coding agents using Cursor for work and Antigravity for personal stuff, and the OpenClaw harness definitely seems worse, but for my low-stakes use-case I managed to paper it over with some edits to the AGENTS.md file.But even in this very crude state it was already interesting to see one of my players giving the agent some info about his character, including an avatar image, and have the agent create a folder in my Obsidian vault to store this and update its memory file to be able to remember it for future interactions.

Frankly, I don't really have major complaints about my life as it is. The things I'd like to do more of are mostly working out and cleaning my house. And I really wish I had kids but am about ready to give up after a half decade of trying and my wife being about ready to age out. Unfortunately, software can't do any of those things for me, no matter how intelligent or agentic it is. When the obstacle to a good life becomes not being able to control multiple computers from a chatroom, maybe I'll come back to this.

Anyway, I hope the author can be a bit more specific about what actually has happened to those unlucky enough to have received these malicious updates. And perhaps a tool to e.g. do a checksum of all Notepad++ files, and compare them to the ones of a verified clean install of the user's installed version, would be a start? Though I would assume these malicious updates would be clever enough to rather have dropped and executed additional files, rather than doing something with the Notepad++ binaries themselves.And I agree with another comment here. With all those spelling mistakes that notification kind of reads like it could have been written by a state-sponsored actor. Not to be (too) paranoid here, but can we be sure that this is the actual author, and that the new version isn't the malicious one?

Every time I'd wait until the people in the forum started sounding optimistic before even looking at the problem statement.I still think I'd like to have a web of trust system where I let my friends try out software updates first before I do, and my relatives let me try them out before they do.

The video referenced in that article explicitly connects directly to the internet, using a VPN to bypass any ISP and router protections and most importantly disables any protections WinXP itself has.So yeah, if you really go out of your way to disable all security protections, you may have a problem.

Notepad++ site says The incident began from June 2025.On their downloads page, 8.8.2 was the first update in June 2025 (the previous update 8.8.1 was released 2025-05-05)So, if your installed version is 8.8.1 or lower, then you should be safe.

So, while I fully agree with your stance that banning political discourse is support for the status quo, I also think that it's reasonable to ask for it to be toned down a bit, especially when the politics and social issues of one country is basically drowning out everything else.All that said, I'm talking mostly about HN or other community forums here. The owner of Notepad++ has the right to put whatever they want into their software, and if we're discussing that here on HN then it's an occasion where discussing politics is valid.

The good sense is your judgement. At some point a real, direct, disruptive protest is going to be the right solution for a big enough group of people. Peaceful protests are just a ""we're starting to get there"" signal. It's not like politicians normally say ""gee, lots of people don't like how I abuse power, I guess I'll stop now"".

In the context of forums, the political threads are generally /not interesting/[0].

Leave that stuff on reddit where the rest of the farts-in-the-wind go to waste. It's like watching commentators on Fox News or CNN or <insert favorite cable TV show here>. They're a large waste of time and they're often geared towards re-enforcing your side, aka echo chamber.Now, if a thread actually evolved into real measurable action, that might actually be interesting. But that's not what happens on these forums. There's probably very few of us that see some HN thread talking about something awful happening somewhere and they take direct action, such as petitioning their government, protesting, etc. It's probably happened once or twice, but most of the farts in those threads just hang around and stink up the place.Please stop stinking up HN.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html

Politics are quite literally life-or-death for many people. War is politics. Access to healthcare is politics. Economic policy that determines whether businesses and careers succeed or fail is politics. Freedom to say what you want, believe or not believe in whatever religion you want, and be who you are without being imprisoned is politics. The people who make the most noise about politics are the people who are literally dying for as long as the rest of society ignores their plight.If this isn't the case for you, it's because you benefit from the status quo. It is the definition of privilege to be able to ""ignore politics"". That means you are currently benefitting from politics. Of course you don't want to hear about politics, politics are doing just fine for you. And the comment you were asking to was asking you to reflect on that: if the biggest problem gracing you is hearing other people make noise about circumstances, the least you could do is deal with it. Your problems are trivial if that is what gets you upset. Other people are complaining about things that affect the outcome of their lives and you're complaining about... having to hear it.

Access to water is political. If you get water from the city, the building of infrastructure delivering water to your residence is political. Whether or not that water is polluted is political. If you get your water from a well on your own property, your ownership of that land is political. None of that is achieved without group consensus, and group consensus can take all of it away from you. You are able to ignore that fact because all of those political consensuses are currently going in your favor, but the same is not true for everyone, and when it isn't true for them, they can be predicted to make noise about not having access to water for obvious reasons. They will make noise about it everywhere they can because it will be more important than anything else to them, given that it will determine whether they live or die and they need to galvanize communal support in order to reverse their fortunes.> You seem very angry at a stranger on the internet.

apparently, it's OK to have this stance of ""if you're not with us, you're against us"".It's absolutely possible to not want political discussions in various places - it doesn't mean you support one or the other side. It simply means you don't want that discussion here. You could support the incumbents or not - not wanting the discussion does not imply support for the incumbents.

It's okay to watch a show about knights and demons and enjoy it. It's okay to use a piece of software that doesn't code every release as a protest against something. Instead of judging other people for not burning out, maybe take a break yourself. It's okay and normal.

I can sorta understand outrage then.

Something similar, significantly different though, happen to a friend.  They started distrusting the incogni.com after seeing their advertisements over and over again. To them they saw/felt/reasoned that only an untrustworthy actor would be pushing the messaging so much and a trustworthy actor would rely more on word of mouth via their good product inspiring people to speak up about them. I had to point out that they probably saw much more of incogni's advertising due to their rate and type of media consumption and most people probably do not get that level of exposure.  If incogni lowered their advertisements to hit them correctly it would not be nearly enough advertising to reach the average consumer.I see the frustration at the repeated messaging to likely be a natural protective mechanism.  Instinctively reject repeated messages is not necessarily a bad instinct since manipulative people will use repeated messaging to manipulate, but repeated message exposure does not only happen due to an attempt to manipulate.

I see this as a bad analogy though: you wouldn't hear about it every time you go to the grocery store. Or, at the very least, you wouldn't stop and listen for the fifth time. You already know, and that's the point: the intention of most activism in technology (at least that I see) is to make you initially aware of it so you start to seek the information out and learn more elsewhere. (...And to give themselves good PR. We love rainbow capitalism /s)Instagram and Twitter both get your attention during election season because they want you to be informed about how to vote. To me, that's a similar thing.

I don't want to either, and indeed I really want others to do it for me. As such, I really want to see even MORE political stuff like this to hopefully create folks who will actually protest and put their neck on the line.Similar reason why US military propaganda is good. I never EVER want to be drafted and indeed if you put a gun in my hand and military fatigues on me, I will die with a shot in the ass (because I am running away). Thankfully, we have a bunch of hardened 20-somethings ""manipulated"" into joining the military and protecting us so that I can be lazy.So please ratchet up the politics and get others out so I don't have to. It's not that hard to ignore yet another plea for help. We do it every hour of every day.

Edit: I'll also add that political messaging is highly contextual. What is appropriate and effective in one place may be counterproductive or actively harmful elsewhere. Format and tone actually matter if you care about your pet cause succeeding, believe it or not.

I view these kinds of weird virtue signaling political statements on things like software to be the same. They do absolutely nothing and are just visual noise for nothing. Actually, this is a good example of where it can go wrong as it likely made the software the target of Chinese state-sponsored actors. So not only does it serve no useful purpose, it also can make you a target and piss people off.

reply

I do not think it is uncommon for someone to do this, then see the side they oppose win more in elections, public perception, etc then decide to engage more and that is ""why is there political messaging literally everywhere"".Since we can't remove it, the next best alternative is to participate and advocate for responsible political engagement. I think until we have some shared understanding of what responsible political engagement is we will continue to have it everywhere.

My opinion is that open source documentation is like polite dinner conversation:  It's not the proper place to discuss politics.If an author wishes to use their open source project as a platform to discuss politics, that's the author's prerogative.  But then, as perhaps in this instance, it could be to the detriment of the project itself.

To get back on topic though, I think conflating using Y app with holding X position on a topic like politics is a dangerous road. Which is where I think having a dedicated space for those politics makes more sense. Whether that's a blog, twitter, etc. It allows those most dedicated to you to know you better without making the product or program a political stance. But the developer is ultimately free to do what they want. So it's not like anyone here can tell the developer to change in any way.

It is also annoying that all these three countries think they can bully other countries too.

I never understood why people felt a need to tie political goals into software. That is a valid statement even if I happen to agree with the political goals here.

If anything, we need much more politics in software, ideally exercised by those who write that software instead of ""apolitical"" software writers who end up executing the political software of those who pay them.If you meant to scope your statement only to FOSS, then this still applies (in fact, FOSS is inherently political), plus I suppose some people who invest their time to write software want to also use the same effort for political activism and there is nothing wrong with that. This can be expressing their political views via that software (e.g., vim and the support to children in Uganda) or can be using a license that only allows co-ops to run their software, or many other ways.The idea that software even could be apolitical stems from the idea that technology can be neutral, which again, in 2026 is really a tough idea to support.

Being political for software means for example making some specific choices while designing it and advertising them as such. Means choosing a license over another. Means announcing political positions and possibly aligning the software to them (depending on what it is).It doesn't mean going in forums related to that software to discuss random political topics.

Having said that, I absolutely despised the implementation that stole keyboard focus; if it popped up when I was typing it frequently disappeared before I head a chance to read it and I had to go into settings to try and find what had changed. Nothing should ever steal keyboard focus unless it's urgent, and then it should website that you can't accidentally manipulate it with a keyboard (see UAC prompt where it opens in the background if the calling program is in the background, and where once you activate it, you have to hold alt+y/n or tab to a button before it accepts the input; just hitting the y/n key alone won't do anything).

> Until version 8.8.7 of Notepad++, the developer used a self-signed certificate, which is available in the Github source code. This made it possible to create manipulated updates and push them onto victims, as binaries signed this way cause a warning „Unknown Publisher“It also mentions ""installing a root certificate"". I suspect that it means that users who installed the root cert could check that a downloaded binary was legit but everyone else (i.e. the majority of users) were trained to blindly click through the warning.

This is also why update signatures should be validated against a different server; it would require hackers to control bother servers to go undetected

reply

No, it should be a hardcoded key held by the developer, preferably using a HSM, and maybe with some sort of notification capability in case the key was lost. Adding a second server adds marginal security. For instance if the developer's mail was hacked, an attacker would likely be able to reset passwords for both hosting providers.

As for whether anything else has been compromised, it depends on whether you were targeted. And the payload might have been tailored to each target, so there's no way to know unless you have access to the exact binary. Unfortunately, binaries downloaded through the auto update feature tend not to linger in your Downloads folder.

And for more modern software distribution mechanisms (e.g., Nix, Guix, Flatpak), centralized package updates may not actually run any vendor code with high privileges at all.The norm for proprietary software updates on Windows is indeed a free-for-all of every publisher downloading and running code with admin rights, and it is indeed a terrible way to operate. Avoiding that kind of madness doesn't necessarily mean running lots of old, vulnerable software.

I mean, if you look at the Notepad++ website this developer seems just as concerned at spamming political messaging all over everything as much as he is with writing the software he's distributing. It's pretty crazy he apparently didn't think to take more basic precautions given he is basically permatrolling Russia and China with his messaging. Big brain moment for him.

After a machine is compromised by malware, there's rarely-to-never a trustworthy way to ever fix it with 100% certainty. And especially worrisome is ""repair"" from the host itself which maybe infected with a rootkit that hides and repairs the malware. Thus, the only correct solution is to completely reimage/reinstall from trusted sources. Deviate from this path at one's own extreme cost/risk.There also exist a tiny amount of even worse, specialized malware, usually deployed by state actors, that infect hardware in such a way that makes them difficult and sometimes uneconomical to repair.PSA: Never run untrustworthy shit on any machine that matters. This also includes FOSS projects that don't have their shit together.

At one point in the project I pointed out a problem, which was heard and recognized, to which I followed up with a solution using an open source package.  I thought I was clever - we needed an extra package in our system, but I was able to find a suitable open source solution that would not add to the overall cost of the project. My proposal was immediately pushed back.Initially I thought it was due to responsibility issue - if we'd employ a FOSS solution we'd be responsible for the outcome. Having a 3rd party vendor the management would have the opportunity to shell themselves.But that doesn't have to be the case. The FOSS project could easily fizzle out. And if we don't have enough resources to incorporate it and make it our own, we can potentially risk being left out to dry.

This is acceptable. Why shouldn't most things started by people not willing to put in the work to keep them going not fizzle out? The important thing is that anyone who actually cares to can jump in and pick up right where the open source software fizzled out and get it going again. Anyone can learn from the code and use it for anything they want, even things that have nothing to do with the goals of the original project.It's not as if there aren't countless examples of corporate vendors dying off and leaving their customers on the hook with nothing, or just changing the product drastically after the sale. At least in the open source case you have the option to fork the project and continue using it as you always have.

They go on about how their server was compromised, and how the big bad Chinese were definitely behind it, and then claim the ""situation has been fully resolved"", but there is zero mention of any investigation into what was actually done by the attackers.

Private keys, probably not. WhatsApp is E2EE meaning your device generates the private key with OS's CSPRNG. (Like I also said above), exfiltration of signing keys might allow MITM but that's still possible to detect e.g. if you RE the client and spot the code that does it.

reply

reply

One interesting way to detect this would be to observe sender's outgoing and recipient's incoming ciphertexts inside the client-to-server TLS that can be MITM'd by users. Since the ratchet state differs, so do the keys, and thus under same plaintext, so do the ciphertexts. That would be really easy way to detect MITM.

reply

Not quite true with Signal's double ratchet though, right? Because keys are routinely getting rolled, you have to continuously exfiltrate the new keys.

reply

Last time I checked, by default, WhatsApp features no fingerprint change warnings by default, so users will not even notice if you MITM them. The attack I described is for situations where the two users would enable non-blocking key change warnings and try to compare the fingerprints.Not saying this attack happens by any means. Just that this is theoretically possible, and leaves the smallest trail. Which is why it helps that you can verify on Signal it's not exfiltrating your identity keys.

This DCL could be fetching some forward_to_NSA() function from a server and registering it to be called on every outgoing message. It would be trivial to hide in tcpdumps, best approach would be tracing with Frida and looking at syscalls to attempt to isolate what is actually being loaded, but it is also trivial for apps to detect they are being debugged and conditionally avoid loading the incriminating code in this instance. This code would only run in environments where the interested parties are sure there is no chance of detection, which is enough of the endpoints that even if you personally can set off the anti-tracing conditions without falling foul of whatever attestation Meta likely have going on, everyone you text will be participating unknowingly in the dragnet anyway.

So the point other commenters are making is that you can verify all you want that the encryption is robust and secure, but that doesn't mean the app can't just send a copy of the info to a server somewhere after it has been decoded.

Detecting backdoors is only truly feasible with open source software and even then it can difficult.A backdoor can be a subtle remote code execution ""vulnerability"" that can only be exploited by the server. If used carefully and it exfiltrates data in expected client-server communications it can be all but impossible to detect. This approach also makes it more likely that almost no insider will even be aware of it, it could be a small patch applied during the build process or to the binary itself (for example, a bound check branch). This is also another reason why reproducible builds are a good idea for open source software.

The claim Stallman would make (after punishing you for using Open Source instead of Free Software for an hour) is that Closed Software (Proprietary Software) is unjust. but in the context of security, the claim would be limited to Free Software being capable of being secure too.You may be able to argue that Open Source reduces risk in threat models where the manufacturer is the attacker, but in any other threat model, security is an advantage of closed source. It's automatic obfuscation.There's a lot of advantages to Free Software, you don't need to make up some.

Not having the source code hasn't stopped people from finding exploits in Windows (or even hardware attacks like Spectre or Meltdown).   Having source code didn't protect against Heartbleed or log4jI'd conclude it comes down to security culture (look how things changed after the Trustworthy Computing initiative, or OpenSSL vs LibreSSL) and ""how many people are looking"" -- in that sense, maybe ""many eyes [do] make bugs shallow"" but it doesn't seem like ""source code availability"" is the deciding factor.  Rather, ""what are the incentives"" -- both on the internal development side and the external attacker side

But it's still possible. And analyzing source code is still hard.

Does this rewording reflect it's meaning?""You don't actually need code to evaluate security, you can analyze a binary just as well.""Because that doesn't sound correct?But that's just my first pass, at a high level.

I was referring to source code to binary maps, these are files that map binary locations to source code locations. In C (gcc/gdb) these are debug objects, they are also used in gdb style debuggers like Python's pdb, Java's jdb. They also exist in js/ts when using minifiers or react, so that you are able to debug in production.

I'm not paying for the tokens I use, so I just choose whatever is the most performant model OpenAI offers. I find LLMs to be highly capable, struggling very little even against fairly obnoxious obfuscation.My use cases have ranged from malware analysis to adding new features to complicated EOL enterprise software without access to the source code.I've done a lot of manual reverse engineering. In many cases you can genuinely 100x your productivity using these tools. Tasks like matching decompilation are an especially good fit for LLMs.

The way they analyze binaries now is by using textual interfaces of command tools, and the tools used are mostly the ones supported by Foundation Models at training time, mostly you can't teach it new tools at inference, they must be supported at training. So most providers are focused on the same tools and benchmarking against them, and binary analysis is not in the zeitgeist right now, it's about production more than understanding.

Also MCP is not an Agent protocol, it's used in a different category. MCP is used when the user has a chatbot, sends a message, gets a response. Here we are talking about the category of products we would describe as Code Agents, including Claude Code, ChatGPT Codex, and the specific models that are trained for use in such contexts.The idea is that of course you can tell it about certain tools in inference, but in code production tasks the LLM is trained to use string based tools such as grep, and not language specific tools like Go To Definition.My source on this is Dax who is developing an Open Source clone of Claude Code called OpenCode

You say they're better with the tools they're trained on. Maybe? But if so not much. And maybe not. Because custom tools are passed as part of the prompt and prompts go a long way to override training.LLMs reason in text. (Except for the ones that reason in latent space.) But they can work with data in any file format as long as they're given tools to do so.

In contrast, I've seen coding agents figure out extremely complex systems problems that are clearly outside of their training set - by using tools and interacting with complex environments, and reasoning and figuring it out.Plus, ""tools"" can be multi-layered.  You give an agent a ""bash"" tool, and voila, it has access to every piece of software ever written.  So I don't think any of these arguments apply in the slightest to the question of de-compiling code.

Like, it's assuredly harder for an agent than having access to the code, if only because there's a theoratical opportunity to misunderstand the decompile.Alternatively, it's assuredly easier for an agent because given execution time approaches infinity, they can try all possible interpretations.

Devin is also going very strong, but it's a bit quieter and growing in enterprises (and pretty sure it uses Claude Opus 4.5 and possibly Claude Code itself). In fact Clawdbot/Moltbot/OpenClaw was itself created with devin.The big difference is the autonomy these models have (Devin more than Claude Codes), Cursor was meant to work in an IDE and that was a huge strength during the 12 months that the models still weren't strong enough to work autonomously, but they are getting to the point where that's becoming a weakness. Models like Devin are getting a slower acceleration but higher top speed advantage. My chips are on Devin

Nobody would ever create a SendPlainTextToZuck() function that had to be called on every message.It would be as simple as using a built in PRNG for client side key generation and then surreptitiously leaking the initial state (dozens of bytes) once in a nonce signing or something when authenticating with the server.

Similarly, it does not provide third parties with access to the methods, and does not have the technical capability to do so under any circumstances.”

1. as others have said, they could be collecting the encrypted messages and then tried to decrypt them using quantum computing, the Chinese have been reportedly trying to do this for many years now.2. with metadata and all the information from other sources, they could infer what the conversation is about without the need to decrypt it: if I visit a page (Facebook cookies, they know), then I share a message to my friend John, and then John visits the same page (again, cookies), then they can be pretty certain that the contain of the message was me sharing the link.

I no longer work at Meta, but in my mind a more likely scenario than (1) is: a senior engineer proposes a 'Decryption at Scale' framework solely to secure their E6 promo, and writes a 40-page Google Doc to farm 'direction' points for PSC. Five PMs repost this on Workplace to celebrate the ""alignment"" so they can also include it in their PSCs.The TL and PMs immediately abandon the project after ratings are locked because they already farmed the credit for it. The actual implementation gets assigned to an E4 bootcamp grad who is told by a non-technical EM to pivot 3 months in because it doesn't look like 'measurable impact' in a perf packet. The E4 gets fired to fill the layoff quota and everyone else sails off into the sunset.

If you never give WhatsApp a cryptographic identity then what key is it using? How are your messages seamlessly showing up on another device when you authenticate? It's not magic, and these convenience features always weaken the crypto in some way.WhatsApp has a feature to verify the fingerprint of another party. How many people do you think use this feature, versus how many people just assume they're safe because they read that WhatsApp has E2EE?

Compromise of the client side application or OS shouldn't break the security model.This should be possible with current API's, since each message could if needed simply be a single frame DRM'ed video if no better approach exists (or until a better approach is built).

Easy: pass laws requiring chat providers to implement interoperability standards so that users can bring their own trusted clients. You're still at risk if your recipient is using a compromised client, but that's a problem that you have the power to solve, and it's much easier to convince someone to switch a secure client if they don't have to worry about losing their contacts.

But in a way, I feel like sometimes it makes sense to not completely open everything. Say a messaging app, it makes sense to not just make it free for all. As a company, if I let you interoperate with my servers that I pay and maintain, I guess it makes sense that I may want to check who you are before. I think?

- Facebook can still control the identity, but there needs to be a legal recourse for getting banned, and their policies can't discriminate against viewpoints, for example- The client specs should be open so that an alternate client can be implemented (sort of like how Telegram is currently)

Agreed.> The client specs should be open so that an alternate client can be implementedAn example that comes to mind is Signal, where they don't want that. They get a lot of criticism for it of course, but I think it the reasoning actually makes sense: in terms of security, allowing third-party clients is a security risk. If your threat model is ""people who risk their life using it"", it makes sense, right?Under the EU's Digital Markets Act, WhatsApp is considered a gatekeeper (Signal is not) and has to be open to interoperability. It seems like they do audit the implementations in order to make sure that the security is not too bad. Which makes sense again, but has a cost. For Meta, that's fine. For Signal... I don't know.Also WhatsApp will - if I understand correctly - make it very clear that you are talking to someone on a third-party client (and again they get a lot of criticism for that). But I think it makes sense... If WhatsApp was so open that every second client was pretty much a spyware, that would defeat the purpose of E2EE messaging.Not that I strongly disagree, but just saying that it seems... complicated.

E2EE is about secure transport between the endpoints. What happens to the message after the endpoint is not something an app can feasibly enforce. Having control of the clients can at most do things like enforcing deletes, which IMO is not a good idea anyway.> every second client was pretty much a spywareVery few people will actually use one since the official app won't be outwardly too hostile, and those who do should be sufficiently discerning.

Suddenly you go from people using WhatsApp to people using random apps that you have no idea about, I think it's a step backward.The ""escape hatch"", IMO, is an alternative messenger (like Signal). If Meta makes WhatsApp really bad, people can just switch to Signal. It's infinitely easier than moving away from AWS or the Microsoft Suite. The lock-in effect is really just that people can't be arsed to install it.I think that the mere existence of Signal already forces Meta to keep WhatsApp relatively good. And to be fair, around me people like WhatsApp better because it has features they want and that Signal doesn't have.

You could of course offload plaintext input and output along with cryptographic operations and key management to separate devices that interact with the networked device unidirectionally over hardware data diodes, that prevent malware from getting in or getting the keys out.Throw in some v3 Onion Services for p2p ciphertext routing, and decent ciphersuite and you've successfully made it to at least three watch lists just by reading this.

When you get a new phone, all you need is your phone number to retrieve the past chats from backup; nothing else. That proves, regardless of specifics, that Meta can read your chats - they can send it to any new phone.So it doesn't really matter that it is E2EE in transit - they just have to wait for the daily backup, and they can read it then.

Obfuscated code is more difficult to unravel in its orginal form than the decompiled form. Decompiled code is a mess with no guideposts, but that's just a matter of time and patience to fix. It's genuinely tricky to write code that decompiles into deceptive appearances.Original position is that it'd be difficult to hide side channel leakage of chat messages in the WhatsApp mobile app. I have not worked on the WhatsApp app, but if it's anything like the mobile apps I have analyzed, I think this is the correct position.If the WhatsApp mobile apps are hairballs of obfuscation and misdirection, I would be a) very surprised, and b) highly suspicious. Since I don't do this work every day any more, I haven't thought much about it. But there are so many people who do this work every day, and WhatsApp is so popular, I'd be genuinely shocked if there were fewer than hundreds of people who have lightly scanned the apps for anything hairbally that would be worth further digging. Maybe I'm wrong and WhatsApp is special though. Happy to be informed if so.

If governments of various countries have compelled Meta to provide a backdoor and also required non-disclosure (e.g. a TCN secretly issued to Meta under Australia's Assistance and Access Act), this is how I imagined they would do it.

What does that even mean? Suppose icloud backups doesn't exist, but you could still take screenshots and save them to icloud drive. Is that also ""Apple has always been able to read encrypted iMessage messages""? Same goes for ""other people having icloud backups enabled"". People can also snitch on you, or get their phones seized. I feel like people like you and the article author are just redefining the threat model of E2EE apps just so they can smugly go ""well ackshually...""

reply

It's not hard to understand why Apple uploading every message to themselves to read by default is different from somebody intentionally taking a screenshot of their own phone.

reply

Is icloud backups opt in or opt out? If it's opt in then would your objection still hold?

reply

What would resolve my objection is if Apple either made messages backups E2EE always, as Google did and as Apple does themselves for other data categories like Keychain passwords, or if they excluded E2EE conversations (e.g. from ADP people) from non-E2EE backups, as Telegram does. Anything short of that does not qualify as E2EE regardless of the defaults, and marketing it as E2EE is false advertising.

For WhatsApp they claim it is like Signal, with the caveat that if you have backups enabled it works like Messenger. Although interestingly if you have backups enabled the key may be stored with Apple/Google rather than Meta, it might be the case that with backup enabled your phone vendor can read your WhatsApp messages but Facebook cannot.

The UI of Element (the most popular Matrix client) is more or less in line with any other chat app, but I guess it depends what you mean by ""on par to whatsapp"". Biggest downside I've found is that you can't search your messages on the mobile clients.

However, most users can't be bothered to choose such a PIN. In this case they choose a 4 or 6 digit pin.To mitigate the risk of brute force, the PIN is rate limited by an HSM. The HSM, if it works correctly, should delete the encryption key if too many attempts are used.Now sure, Meta could insert itself between the client and HSM and MITM to extract the PIN.But this isn't a Meta specific gap, it's the problem with any E2EE system that doesn't require users to memorize a master password.I helped design E2EE systems for a big tech company and the unsatisfying answer is that there is no such thing as ""user friendly"" E2EE. The company can always modify the client, or insert themselves in the key discovery process, etc. There are solutions to this (decentralized app stores and open source protocols, public key servers) but none usable by the average person.

Every time you sign in to the web interface or resign into the app you enter it.  I don't remember an option for an alphanumeric pin or to offload it to a third party.

The Messenger PIN is rate limited by an HSM, you merely enter it through the web interface.Of course, the HSM could be backdoored or the client could exfil the secret but the latter would be easy to discover.Harder to do any better here without making the user memorize a master password, which tends to fail miserably in real life.

“The U.S. investigates” unfortunately does not mean as much as it used to.

Everything regarding encrypted messaging is downstream of the reality that it's better for UX for the app developer to own the keys. Once developers have the keys, they're going to be compelled by governments to provide them when warrants are issued. Force and violence, not mathematical proofs, are the ultimate authority.It's fun to get into the “conspiratorial” discussions, like where the P-256 curve constants came from or whether the HSMs have backdoors. Ultimately, none of that stuff matters. Users don't want their messages to go poof when their phone breaks, and governments will compel you to change whatever bulletproof architecture you have to better serve their warrants.

The evidence is pretty clear that Facebook wants to do everything they legally can to track and monitor people, and they're perfectly okay crossing the line and going to court to find the boundaries.Using a company like that for encrypted messaging seems like an unnecessary risk.  Maybe they're not decrypting it, but they're undoubtedly tracking everything else about the conversation because that's what they do.

Of course, the one advantage of having source is that it is easier to run things like SAST tools against source, but how many people do that in practice? How integrated is that with package systems? And when package maintainers might provide hashes of what they ostensibly checked, you still need trust.So we need a combination of static analysis tools that are integrated properly to produce trusted binaries, and you need earned trust and authority. Hyperindividualist self-reliance is, at the very minimum, impractical. And with authority, we know whose job it is to care for the quality of software and therefore whom to hang.

However commits tend to be much easier to trace at a later date than arbitrary binaries so attackers will be less inclined to go that route. Once committed it's there forever unless you can somehow get everyone to censor it from their own copies for an unrelated reason. Consider that the xz compromise involved downloading the payload later.My policy is to either obtain binaries from a major distro or to build from a clean commit in a network isolated environment. If I can't go one of those routes it's almost always a hard pass for me.

EDIT because I wanted to add some more thoughts: ""Sovereignty"" means ""supreme power or authority"". It is valid to say ""EU member states should have the ultimate supreme authority and not be subservient to the EU"". It is also valid to say ""the EU (as in all the EU member states) should have the ultimate supreme authority and not be subservient to the US"". The two ideas are not even in conflict with each other. If you think EU member states should be completely sovereign, you can still find it valuable to have EU-wide sovereignty initiatives which decrease the US's authority over EU member states.There are two ways ""EU sovereignty"" can be read. One is ""the EU and its member states should have the supreme authority over themselves and not be controlled by the US"". The other is ""the political body known as 'the EU' should have the supreme authority over its member states"". I don't think these sovereignty initiatives are meant to be read as the latter.

> the EU (as in all the EU member states)No, it's the EU, not the member states independently as sovereign states. Note also that there is a huge difference between ""European cooperation"" and ""EU integration"".Over time the EU has taken over significant levers of sovereignty away from member states. The single currency was a very big one (hence some countries decided to stay away).

No, it's the EU, not the member states independently as sovereign states.

That's why I think the way the term ""sovereign"" is thrown around is misleading and in fact part of push to transfer more control, and in fine sovereignty, to the EU from member states. People can decide if that's good or bad but the process is misleading.HN is about curiosity and it seems that commenters do not use any as soon as the EU is mentioned but rather accept the official narrative without questions. The trend is to reduce member states' sovereignty, not to increase it, while the EU is taking over.

But the rationale is clear. Europe has spent too many centuries and too many lives in warfare. There is no way forwards that isn't some kind of unified structure with the guns pointed outwards.

An European country with strong military relation/dependence on the US, say, a la South Korea is still more sovereign than if it becomes a simple 'state' of a federal EU...It is even more obvious if you take France as example as France has low dependency on the US and has been careful to keep its independence on defence matters. So for France it is all a pure loss of sovereignty and independence (which has been going on for years now, tbh).To me, the EU is only using Trump tactically to further its aim of greater control over European defence.The irony, or worse, is that no later than 2023 it was apparently urgent for Sweden and Finland to join NATO and to buy F-35s (Finland and many others)... The only clear thing is that we are taken for fools.

It's also correct that the term ""sovereign"" is used incorrectly in this headline; I think what they meant to say is ""independence"".> [...] it seems that commenters do not use any as soon as the EU is mentioned but rather accept the official narrative without questions.Which narrative is that?

In reality the EU heads of state appoint the EU commissioners and form the EU council, and the EU parliament is elected by the public. Nothing gets passed by the EU without the approval of the council and parliament, and while it's arguable that parliament is a ""rubber stamp"" shop, it's certainly more independent from the executive than the US congress is, and the Council certainly isn't. It's also true that any country in the EU can choose to leave the EU at any time, unlike say the US, who refuse the right to self determination of its people.

Exactly. If countries want to be 100% sovereign, they can do a Brexit and enjoy the benefits and the downsides of doing that.This {$x}exitter bullshit is so tiring. 27 space programs, 12 types of fighter jets etc are horrible expensive. EU-countries enjoy super-high benefits of sharing burdens. In times of might makes right, it gives each a high degree of sovereignty for a steep discount. Yes, being part of a collective does mean that you have to give-and-take with the collective.It isn't a game of all ""benefits for me"" in a zero sum game.

The goal is to level the playing field to prevent countries to look for non European alternatives for now, which often happen in Europe when nobodies coordinates the actions of different countries when something becomes suddenly urgent (I do not thinkg it's really, but government must always show they do something, and US companies operating constellations have good salesmen).

But without unity each one of us would just be yet another small country with a declining population, unity gives us strength.The US leadership today thinks they are powerful enough by themselves. Quite a different perspective. Hence why sovereignty there seems to have a more patriotic meaning. I'm sure the states themselves still see the value of collaborating between themselves however.

""EU sovereignty"" in this context means being the EU being able to act with comparable agency to the US or China, as a world power.  Italy or Belgium is never going to be a world power again.Right now the EU would find it severely challenging if the US, say, broke out in a civil war and lost most of its remaining industrial, service, communications, infrastructural & military power projection functionality.

Nothing new there, but I wouldn't assume Chinese bot army being behind it. The Russians, American MAGA, European alt-right each have an interest in such suppression (and RU and USA also conduct industrial espionage on EU). You may assume each of these parties is present in a thread about European sovereignty, but either way the mods discourage any discussion about moderation. You're best off emailing one of them.

Only days after a nationwide general strike to protest the Trump administration's brutal immigration crackdown, a new group is now embarking on a longer coordinated economic strike, this time targeting a handful of tech companies.

“Resist and Unsubscribe” is a month-long economic strike focusing for the most part on tech and AI companies, aka “where economic and political power is most concentrated,” according to NYU Stern marketing professor Scott Galloway, who is spearheading the movement.

“The most radical action in a capitalist society is non-participation,” Galloway said in a video promoting the boycott. “The Trump administration doesn't respond to outrage; it responds to economic signals.”

The movement identified 10 subscription-driven consumer tech and AI companies that they say have an outsized influence on both Trump and the economy. Those companies are Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Paramount+, Uber, Netflix, X, Meta, and OpenAI.

“America's economy is one giant bet on AI, with seven tech companies representing more than a third of the S&P 500. That means the best way to ignite positive change, without hurting consumers, is to carry out an economic strike the tech CEOs can't ignore,” Galloway wrote in a blog post.

These big tech companies are not only keeping the economy running, but they also have unprecedented access to the President. Silicon Valley interests have held a sizable presence in Trump's approach to trade and regulation. One of his few instances of walking back threats in his grand attack on anti-ICE protesters was his decision to refrain from increasing the federal force in San Francisco, which he said he changed his mind on after talking to tech executives like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.

Not only have tech companies had influence over Trump's decisions, but some have also offered support for his immigration policy. Back in October, Apple removed an app that allows users to track ICE activity because Attorney General Pam Bondi asked them to, and Palantir has built a $30 million surveillance platform for the agency.

Tech workers are also aware of this influence, and many have signed a letter asking company executives to speak out publicly, end all contracts with ICE, and demand that the White House end the crackdown. After the letter was released, Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees that he had brought the matter up in a conversation with Trump.

As part of the new boycott, protesters are spending all of February unsubscribed from paid services offered by these 10 major tech companies, such as Amazon Prime, Uber One, ChatGPT Plus, Microsoft Office, or YouTube Premium. The organizers are also asking people to refrain from buying Apple hardware products until March and to delete Meta platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook. They will, however, continue using Instagram as a way to spread the message, but ask boycotters to refrain from clicking on any ads and shopping from any links you may encounter on the platform.

The strike will also be targeting nine consumer-facing companies that they claim are “active enablers of ICE”: AT&T, Comcast, Charter Communications, Dell, FedEx, UPS, Home Depot, Lowe's, Spotify, and Marriott.

AT&T, Xfinity provider Comcast, and computer maker Dell's government contracting arm have all signed contracts with ICE to offer their services to the agency. Internet provider Spectrum's parent company Charter provides cable TV and internet services to the Homeland Security Investigations office in Beaumont, Texas. A 404 Media report from August claimed that both Home Depot and Lowe's share access to data from their AI-powered license plate readers with law enforcement surveillance systems that ICE can use, but Home Depot has since denied that claim. Spotify was under fire late last year for running ICE recruitment ads on its platform, carriers FedEx and UPS have delivery contracts with the agency, and reports have claimed that a Marriott-owned Sheraton hotel in Louisiana was used by ICE agents to hold detained families.

Protesters have previously been successful in getting companies to lose their business partnerships with ICE, like with Avelo Airlines, which decided last month to stop its ICE deportation flights after months of scrutiny. And on Sunday, French tech giant Capgemini divested from its U.S. subsidiary that was doing business with ICE, following scrutiny from union workers and French government officials.

Although both the general strike and “Resist and Unsubscribe” aim to hit Trump where it hurts, the month-long strike is a more sustained and hyper-focused approach, only targeting a group of large businesses. Retail analysts told Axios on Friday that general strikes tend to struggle in sustaining participation over days, which is when it would truly start to impact sales data.

“It's easy for me to tell other people to stop working and take the risk of getting fired; that kind of walkout would only hurt small businesses and probably lead to more job losses,” Galloway said on his blog. “We're also not urging local businesses to sacrifice sales and close their doors for a day, a symbolic but ultimately ineffective tool.”

Gizmodo sought comment from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Paramount+, Uber, Netflix, X, Meta, AT&T, Comcast, Dell, Charter, FedEx, Home Depot, Lowe's, Marriott, Spotify, UPS, and OpenAI. We will update if we hear back.

Who needs the Super Bowl to start promo after all? Paramount's decided to get in on the ad festivities early with the “big game” spot for Scream 7 this morning, with some new footage and a nostalgic poster.

Set years after Scream 6, the new film takes us to Pine Grove, Indiana, where Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has been living a nice life with her family. But someone new's taken up the Ghostface mantle and started killing again. Along with Sidney's family being in danger, several of the victims include the friends of her daughter Tatum (Isabel May), which requires the Prescotts to get some help from Gale (Courtney Cox) and the Meeks-Martin twins, Mindy (Jasmine Savoy-Brown) and Chad (Mason Gooding).

This new spot teases one of the new big kills and a potential killer having a fixation on Sidney for years and just escaping a psychiatric hospital. Whoever they are, they've intentionally started up at the same age Tatum and her friends were when Sidney and Gale first went through all this in the original Scream. And it's not a coincidence that this and the first trailer end with someone who sounds like Matthew Lillard saying all of this “is going to be fun” for them.

Scream 7 hits theaters on February 27, and tickets go on sale next Monday, February 9.

It's time to face your past, Sidney.

TV makers imagined the future would be filled with even more pixels, but the 8K promised land was never to be. One more major company has effectively called off its plans for big, expensive 8K TVs, leaving only Samsung holding the torch for a screen type that few, if anybody, actually want.

LG, one of the most prominent TV and display manufacturers in the world, is exiting the 8K TV market without much fanfare. The company told FlatpanelsHD that it was “taking a comprehensive view of current display market trends and the trends within the 8K content ecosystem.” In human speak, that means it's putting 8K TVs on ice, at least for now.

See LG QNED MiniLED 8K TV at Best Buy

This past weekend, FlatpanelsHD quoted several anonymous sources to say the company's latest 8K TV, the QNED99TUA mini LED, was being discontinued. Currently, the TV is on sale for $2,500 at 86 inches, more than half off from its regular $5,300 price. It's clear based on the muffled rumblings and shrugs coming from the screen-loving crowd that there aren't many tears being shed for 8K's demise.

Samsung is practically the only major player trying to make 8K work with the most recent 98-inch QN990H. It announced the 8K TV at CES 2026 without any details about pricing and availability. Back in 2020, the Korean tech giant offered three 8K TV models; now it can't even bother to tell us more about one. I've spent time in front of Samsung's previous 8K models, like the $5,000 QN900D, and the experience left me underwhelmed. There's very little wrong with Samsung's picture quality and brightness, but even when watching native 8K content, I was hard-pressed to find the difference between it and 4K. You would need an exceptionally large TV to spot any more clarity from 4K to 8K, and that's if you can find something to watch at that resolution.

Console makers have also walked back their 8K ambitions. Sony's PlayStation 5 shipped in 2020 with a blaring “8K” sticker on their box art. Only a bare few games ever supported the resolution, including titles like No Man's Sky and The Touryst. A few more games like Gran Turismo 7 support the extra pixels on PlayStation 5 Pro thanks to upscaling. In 2024, Sony started removing the “8K” support notice on the box.

Paul Gray, an analyst for the research firm Omdia, told FlatpanelHD back in 2024 that only 1.6 million 8K TVs had been sold since companies started pushing the resolution to Japanese audiences in 2015. In the same time frame, 4K TVs have been growing like weeds. S&S Insider reported the market for ultra high-definition (UHD) is valued at $305.58 billion, with 70% of buyers in North America and Western Europe preferring 4K. You can't walk through a Best Buy without tripping on at least a dozen varieties of UHD TVs.

TCL and Sony have both abandoned the 8K TV game. In particular, TCL was more willing to say the quiet part out loud. In 2023, the major budget TV brand said, “Looking at the market, it is not what people had expected.” In January 2026, Sony handed TCL the keys to its TV kingdom, announcing TCL is taking a 51% stake in its TV business. Starting next year, the budget brand will produce Sony's high-end Bravia OLEDs and QLEDs.

TV buyers were given every opportunity to choose 8K, but few—if any—ever took the bite. The HDMI 2.2 standard boosted the signal to support higher resolutions, with 8K resolutions able to support 240Hz refresh rate. It changed little about the actual market. Judging by this past CES's long lineup of new TVs, the new hotness isn't higher pixel counts, but novel screen types ranging from tandem OLED to WOLED (for brighter organic light-emitting diode displays) and more compact micro RGB TVs promising better color accuracy with local dimming. Screen resolution has plateaued, but screen makers are still trying to craft the next big thing.

Say hello to Grammy-winning, newly inducted EGOT man Steven Spielberg.

During Sunday's Grammy awards, the filmmaker took home an award for the 2024 documentary film, Music by John Williams. It won for “Best Music Film” at the non-televised ceremony, and marks his first win and nomination at the music-focused event. Spielberg, along with others like George Lucas and Kathleen Kennedy, both produced the doc and feature in it, talking about their about their relationship with Williams.

In a statement, Spielberg thanked Grammy voters, calling it a “obviously deeply meaningful because it validates what I have known for over 50 years: John Williams' influence on culture and music is immeasurable and his artistry and legacy is unrivaled.” For those keeping track at home, Spielberg is the 21st EGOT recipient, joined by the likes of Viola Davis and Elton John. He's also the oldest EGOT winner at 79 years old, and the third director after John Gielgud in 1991 and Mike Nichols in 1991.

The first collaboration with Steven Spielberg and John Williams was 1974's Sugarland Express after he specifically requested Williams to work on the film. A year later, they reunited for the first Jaws, followed by Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Jurassic Park, and the Indiana Jones series. Several films they've worked on together, such as ET and Schindler's List, were nominated and later won Best Original Score at the Oscars. Their partnership is so strong that Williams announced he'd likely retire from scoring films after Indiana Jones 5, only to come back to score Spielberg's ci-fi flick Disclosure Day, which hits theaters in June.

Handheld gaming meets workstation-level memory

The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X, Microsoft's first Xbox-branded gaming handheld, comes with 24GB of LPDDR5X memory, which is more than adequate for most use cases in this category. However, for users who want more headroom or plan to use the handheld as a hybrid portable desktop replacement, SlickBuys Mods and Repairs has successfully upgraded the system to a massive 64GB of RAM. This is the same modder who previously demonstrated their skills on the original ROG Ally by upgrading its memory from 16GB to 32GB.

In a detailed video, the modder has showcased the entire process of replacing the soldered 6GB Micron LPDDR5X 8533 MT/s memory packages with higher-density 16GB SK Hynix LPDDR5X modules. The process involves completely dismantling the ROG Xbox Ally X by undoing a bunch of screws to remove the back panel, followed by carefully removing the internal components, including the battery, SSD, joysticks, heatsink, and a bunch of ribbon cables.

After gaining full access to the motherboard, the modder begins preparing the new memory modules by desoldering them from a custom PCB they were shipped with and reballing each memory chip. The stock 24GB memory modules are then removed from the ROG Xbox Ally X motherboard with a heat gun, along with any solder residue. The new modules are then placed and soldered onto the motherboard.

Once the new memory modules are installed, the next step is to modify the BIOS so it can properly recognize the newly installed RAM. The original BIOS chip is removed, and the APCB file is edited with a bunch of values using a CH341A USB programmer. The BIOS chip is then soldered back onto the motherboard, followed by moving two strap resistors to ensure that the newly installed memory chips run at their maximum clock speeds. The modder then reassembles all the components, and after booting into the system, we can see that the Windows Task Manager indicates 64GB of installed memory.

Unfortunately, the modder has not shared any performance benefits post the memory upgrade, nor do they mention the entire cost for this mod. Considering the $300 32GB memory upgrade previously done on the original ROG Ally, along with today's highly volatile DRAM market, we wouldn't be surprised if it is upwards of $500, which is almost half the cost of the gaming handheld.

While this mod is exciting, it's important to note that upgrading soldered memory is not easy, even if it may look straightforward. The process requires specialized tools, skills, and knowledge, and even if one manages to replace the chips successfully, modifying the BIOS and the risk of damaging the motherboard make such mods impractical for most users.

At its January meeting, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA's) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending revisions to the approved indications for Noxafil (posaconazole, Merck). 

The changes expand and clarify how the drug may be used in pediatric patients from 2 years of age and remove the requirement for prior treatment failure in cases of invasive aspergillosis across several formulations.

The recommendation represents a modification to the current marketing authorization and will require adoption by the European Commission before taking effect.

A central change in the updated indications is that treatment of invasive aspergillosis is no longer limited to patients with refractory disease or intolerance to prior antifungal therapy. This applies consistently across the following formulations:

This represents a meaningful expansion of clinical use, allowing Noxafil to be used for invasive aspergillosis irrespective of prior treatment response, within the age and formulation-specific criteria defined in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

For other invasive fungal infections, the updated indications continue to limit use of Noxafil to patients whose disease is refractory to standard antifungal therapy or who are intolerant of it, regardless of formulation. These infections include:

Refractory disease is defined as progression of infection or failure to improve after a minimum of seven days of prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal treatment.

Across the relevant formulations, Noxafil remains indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in patients at high risk. This includes individuals receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes with expected prolonged neutropenia, as well as haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients undergoing high-dose immunosuppressive therapy for graft-versus-host disease.

Detailed prescribing guidance will be provided in the updated Summary of Product Characteristics, which will be published on the EMA website in all official European Union languages following the European Commission's formal decision on the marketing authorization change.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved an extension of indication for Akeega (Janssen-Cilag International) — a dual‑action tablet combining niraparib and abiraterone acetate — to be used with prednisone or prednisolone plus androgen‑deprivation therapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic hormone‑sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) harboring BRCA1/2 (germline or somatic) mutations.

Patients with mHSPC who harbor BRCA1/2 mutations experience more aggressive disease progression and shorter survival compared with those without these genetic alterations. Approximately 1 in 4 patients with mHSPC carry homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene alterations, most commonly BRCA1/2, which are associated with faster disease advancement. 

Current treatment approaches for mHSPC do not specifically target these underlying DNA repair deficiencies, creating significant unmet medical needs for this high-risk population. Most patients ultimately develop resistance to available therapies and progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), which has limited long-term survival prospects.

Akeega contains niraparib, which blocks PARP-1 and PARP-2 enzymes that help repair damaged DNA in dividing cells, preventing cancer cells from repairing DNA damage and causing cell death. Abiraterone acetate stops testosterone production by blocking the CYP17 enzyme, helping slow prostate cancer growth because the cancer requires testosterone to survive and grow.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use's recommendation stems from positive results from the ongoing phase 3 AMPLITUDE study, which enrolled 696 patients with mHSPC and HRR gene alterations. Patients with BRCA1/2 mutations showed the greatest treatment benefit, with median radiographic progression-free survival not reached compared with 26 months for those receiving placebo plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone. 

The combination reduced the risk for radiographic progression or death by 48% and significantly prolonged time to symptomatic progression by 56% in patients with BRCA alterations. An early analysis showed a trend toward improved overall survival, with a 25% reduction in risk for death, though follow-up continues for data maturity. 

The safety profile of Akeega remained consistent with that observed in mCRPC, for which the combination currently holds authorization. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events included anemia and hypertension, although treatment discontinuations due to adverse events remained low and side effects proved manageable with dose modifications and supportive care. 

Akeega received initial authorization in April 2023 throughout the European Economic Area for treating patients with BRCA-mutated mCRPC when chemotherapy is not clinically indicated. The medicine is available as tablets taken orally on an empty stomach once daily for as long as patients benefit or do not experience unacceptable side effects, and it requires a prescription for use.

Detailed recommendations will be included in the updated Summary of Product Characteristics, to be published on the EMA website in all official European Union languages following the European Commission's decision on the marketing authorization change.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Among patients admitted to cardiac ICUs, influenza vaccination was associated with stronger serological protection, especially against subtype A(H3N2), and lower rates of ST‑segment elevation myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and severe clinical presentation during seasonal epidemics.

TAKEAWAY:

""[The study] findings reinforce the need to incorporate influenza vaccination as an integral component of inpatient management for cardiac patients during the influenza season,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Alicia Galar, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain. It was published online on January 20, 2026, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.

This study lacked pre-vaccination serum samples, so it could not determine whether measured antibodies were due to vaccination or recent infection. Defining influenza infection solely by molecular testing at admission might have missed infections in which cardiac complications occurred after viral clearance. Vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups differed substantially in age, which may have introduced confounding.

This study was funded by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III and co-funded by the European Union. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

During her lifetime, the beloved American actor Mary Tyler Moore was an outspoken advocate for type 1 diabetes (T1D) research. Since her passing in 2017, her husband, S. Robert Levine, MD, has led an ambitious initiative aimed at transforming the clinical approach to the diabetic retinal disease (DRD) that plagued Moore in her later years.

The initiative was first launched in 2018 in collaboration with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (now Breakthrough T1D), for which Moore had served as international chairperson for over 30 years. Initially called the “Restoring Vision Moonshot,” it was renamed the Mary Tyler Moore (MTM) Vision Initiative in 2022.

“Vision loss was the diabetes' complication that affected Mary's life the most. In her heart, Mary was a dancer. It was in dance that she found her joy. Diabetes stole her joy because diabetic retinal disease stole her vision,” Levine told Medscape Medical News.

The initiative aims to accelerate research efforts to prevent and restore vision loss due to DRD, a term that includes diabetes-related retinopathy, macular edema, and retinal neurodegeneration. Its goals include the development of a new DRD staging system, identification of new endpoints and biomarkers, artificial intelligence-enhanced diagnostics, and ultimately new preventive approaches and treatments such as retinal regeneration or replacement.

“We brought together retina experts from all over the world, and one of the first things we decided to invest in was an update of the current Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] staging system, which is 50 years old and unidimensional. It only looks the vascular side of the disease, and we now know that DRD is a disease of the entire retinal neurovascular unit,” Levine explained.

In fact, he noted, as many as 30% of people with diabetes who have normal-appearing retinas on photography already have demonstrable visual field defects. “So there needs to be a better way to stage. And once you have a better way of staging, you can create new indications for therapeutics development.”

While chronically elevated glucose levels raise the odds of developing DRD, everyone living with diabetes is at risk. One recent study showed that more than half the people who develop diabetes — type 1 or type 2 — in childhood develop DRD by a mean age of 26 years.

Current treatments include laser photocoagulation, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections, and surgery (vitrectomy). While these can preserve sight in many with late-stage DRD, they don't work for everyone. Moreover, all involve some degree of risk, including scarring with laser treatments and infection with invasive eye injections, Jennifer Sun, MD, scientific co-director of the initiative, told Medscape Medical News.

“There's a lot of room for new, more effective therapies that are nondestructive and noninvasive,” said Sun, who is also a professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Moore herself underwent multiple laser treatments after being diagnosed with proliferative retinopathy in the mid-1980's. At that point, she had lived with T1D for about 16 years.

“The laser preserved her central vision, so she continued to be able to read and to perform, but dancing requires peripheral vision and her visual fields were narrowed considerably. Over time, it got much worse, to the point where she really couldn't safely cross a room without assistance. And ultimately, later in life, she was nearly blind,” Levine said.

“As a clinician, I would also love to see therapies that treat earlier stage disease, so that we're not waiting for people to lose vision or be on the brink of losing vision before we treat them,” said Sun.

As well as looking for preventive strategies to help patients with diabetes maintain their vision, the initiative is also looking for therapies that work on a global perspective, that is “therapies that are readily accessible, affordable, and that can be safely administered, without the need for super-specialized care,” she added.

Levine told Medscape Medical News that the initiative “has organized a public-private precompetitive consortium that enables industry to gain access to the data and research being developed by the initiative.” This consortium is based at the University of Michigan, with Harvard's Joslin Diabetes Center as a lead academic partner. Funding comes from private philanthropy, including Breakthrough T1D, for core projects.

Boehringer Ingelheim joined the consortium in late 2024, followed by “numerous device manufacturers, biotech companies, and major pharmaceutical companies as members and project-specific supporters.”

Separately, the Entertainment Industry Foundation — which founded “Stand Up to Cancer” — and Variety magazine lend publicity support to the initiative.

“We're positioning ourselves as an accelerator. We can't do everything, but we're doing what we can to attract investment, both of intellectual capital and dollars, to help accelerate the development of new therapeutics to eliminate vision loss,” Levine said.

While it doesn't actually conduct clinical trials of new therapies, the initiative identifies needs, provides resource materials for researchers including an ocular biorepository and a retinal image database, sponsors a yearly symposium and workshops, and publishes papers to raise awareness of various aspects of DRD.

It also incorporates the patient voice. Patients and caregivers are invited to participate in a virtual meeting on February 12, 2026, to inform the FDA and other stakeholders about “experiences, perspectives, needs, and priorities” regarding drug development and regulatory decision-making.

The initiative also works with the longstanding DRCR Retina Network (formerly the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network) funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support large multicenter clinical trials to validate biomarkers and endpoints that would be needed to accelerate product approvals.

Sun, who also co-leads the DRCR, explained, “We designed studies that we then brought to the DRCR investigator and coordinator group. We asked if they would partner with us to use the DRCR's existing clinical trial infrastructure to perform them.”

Two upcoming studies for which the protocols were developed by the MTM Vision Initiative will be conducted by DRCR. One will examine functional endpoints in about 100 patients over the course of 1 year following anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic macular edema. The other is a larger and longer natural history study that will follow patients for over 4 years.

“I think these two studies will start to identify ways to characterize the retinas of people with diabetes, and start to build expectations of how we how we look at and describe patients' visual function,” said Sun.

“Hopefully, these studies will provide ways to measure vision that will be more sensitive, more attuned to early changes, and that will help us efficiently find targets for new treatments.”

Asked to comment on the initiative, Stephen J. Kim, MD, the Phyllis G. and William B. Snyder Chair and Retina Division Chief at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, told Medscape Medical News, “It a relatively new initiative that's growing in popularity. They're doing a good job of getting buy-in from experts to come to their meetings, to collaborate, and to have a shared vision.”

Compared to the traditional DRCR Network, the MTM Vision Initiative “has a different angle,” said Kim, who was an author of the American Academy of Ophthalmology's 2025 Diabetic Retinopathy Preferred Practice Pattern. “It's trying to incorporate new technologies, [and] new ways of diagnosing and defining the disease.”

This could help speed the time to new therapeutic discovery. “One of the main things” the initiative is doing is looking for “different biomarkers that can show us changes in the disease process,” Kim said.

“Right now, they're just in the process of validating new markers for clinical trials. Once they start adopting or pushing one, there may be controversy,” he noted. “But it's not controversial now.”

Levine and Moore met in 1982, when she brought her mother into the emergency room at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City one night when Levine happened to be on call. At the time, he was a cardiology fellow and founder of the institution's cardiovascular disease prevention and rehabilitation program. They married the following year.

In 1985, Moore decided to accept the position as international chair of the organization then called the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF). “At that time, there weren't a lot of celebrities willing to risk their careers by being public about their struggles with chronic disease,” Levine noted.

Moore was a dancer first, then an actor in two iconic American sitcoms — The Dick Van Dyke Show in the 1960s and The Mary Tyler Moore Show in the 1970s.

As a diabetes advocate, she helped raise billions of dollars for research funding. According to the site, “While Mary did not see a cure for diabetes in her lifetime, her legacy of leading efforts to ensure that future generations would not have to experience [its burdens] as she did, lives on through our work.”

Three years after Moore started as chair of the JDF, Levine left his cardiology practice to volunteer full-time for the Foundation, serving at various times as head of their government relations program and of their communications committee. He also helped develop their research strategy, and played a major role in securing bipartisan Congressional passage of funding for the Special Diabetes Program, which both advanced T1D research at the NIH and provided T2D treatment, education, and prevention programs for American Indian and Alaska Native populations. Today, Levine devotes nearly all his time to the MTM Vision Initiative.

The meetings and programs of the MTM Vision Initiative received educational and research grant support from a number of pharma, biotech, and device companies. Levine reported being occasionally provided with compensation and travel reimbursement for invited presentations for pharma collaborators. 

Sun reported receiving research support from Adaptive Sensory Technology, Boehringer Ingelheim, F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Genentech, LKC Technologies, Konan, Novo Nordisk, Optovue, Inc., and Physical Sciences, Inc., and other relationships with Alcon, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Novo Nordisk. Kim disclosed having no relevant financial relationships.

Access to patient-reported outcome (PRO) data significantly improved providers' consistency in assessing adverse events in patients with cancer, with the greatest improvements observed for psychological and cognitive symptoms.

""Future research should explore the implementation of PRO-informed adverse event rating, also in longitudinal assessment settings, its effect on toxicity profiles, and its usefulness in different cancer types and treatment modalities,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Lisa M. Wintner, PhD, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy, Psychosomatics and Medical Psychology, University Hospital of Psychiatry II, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. It was published online on January 19, 2026, in The Lancet Oncology.

A potential contamination effect existed as providers assessed patients in both the intervention and control groups. The Hawthorne effect may have influenced clinicians to pay more attention to symptom documentation than they would in routine care. High proportions of CTCAE ratings below grade 1 created a floor effect, potentially reducing the statistical power to detect differences in moderate or severe toxicities. Additionally, although providers had at least 1 year of oncology experience, no specific CTCAE training was mandated, potentially contributing to rating variability.

The trial was funded by a grant from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life group. One author reported receiving a grant from the same group. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

An international research consortium, led by scientists at VIB and UGent, has developed a new platform that could change how antibody medicines are tested and brought to patients. The work, published in Science Immunology, highlights problems during conventional antibody drug testing and introduces a next-generation mouse model that makes it possible to predict the effects of antibody drugs in humans more accurately. 

Antibody-based medicines are widely used to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Many of these drugs look extremely promising during early testing. However, a large number later fail in clinical trials or show unexpected side effects. This slows down drug development, drives up costs, and can put patients at risk.

""Our new platform allows us to study antibody function in conditions that are much closer to what happens in patients,"" says Prof. Bart Lambrecht (VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research), senior author of the study. ""That means we can make better, more confident decisions much earlier in drug development.""

Before new medicines are tested in humans, they are studied in the laboratory, including in culture systems, lab mice, and non-human primates to estimate their effects and toxicities. These systems have been essential for medical progress, but new research shows they do not always reflect how the human immune system works, especially for antibody drugs.

Antibodies, particularly Immunoglobulin G (IgG), the blueprint for all approved therapeutic antibodies, do more than bind to a target. Their tail region, known as the Fc domain, sends instructions to the immune system. These instructions are read by Fc gamma (Fcγ) receptors on immune cells and determine whether immune cells kill infected or cancerous cells, remove harmful targets, or dampen inflammation.

The challenge is that these Fcγ receptors differ substantially between species. As a result, the same antibody can trigger very different immune responses depending on the biological system in which it is tested.

The study shows that the human immune system responds to antibody drugs in ways that are not always captured during early testing, with real-world consequences. In people, several immune cell types are highly responsive to, while in laboratory models these same responses are often much weaker or absent. Even more importantly, human platelets, the cells that control blood clotting, can be directly activated by certain antibodies. This mechanism does not exist in mice, meaning dangerous clotting risks can remain hidden during early testing. Other immune cells can also react in opposite ways depending on the system used.

Because of these differences, antibody drugs can appear safe or effective early on, only to behave very differently in patients. A well-known example is the development of anti-CD40L antibodies, which progressed to clinical trials after reassuring early results but later caused severe blood clots and patient deaths. These risks were not detected sooner because crucial human-specific immune interactions were invisible in standard preclinical studies.

To solve this problem, the researchers first created a detailed map showing how Fcγ receptors are distributed across immune cells in humans and commonly used testing systems. They then used this information to build a new mouse model that closely reflects how the human immune system handles antibodies. This ensures that antibodies interact with immune cells in a way that closely mirrors human immune biology, including how receptor expression changes during inflammation.

In contrast to existing humanized mouse models, this new model uses a more precise genetic 'knock-in' strategy and is made commercially available, guaranteeing access for academic researchers and drug developers alike.

The new platform has been rigorously validated across multiple disease settings. It enables researchers to reliably rank antibody candidates by true biological effectiveness, assess how well antibodies remove specific immune cells, and evaluate how antibodies limit disease progression for example in the context of cancer. These types of comparisons are difficult or impossible with conventional approaches.

According to dr. Karel Van Damme (VIB-UGent, UZ Gent), first author of the study, ""Modern antibody development increasingly depends on subtle molecular fine-tuning. Our platform allows different antibody designs to be compared head-to-head in a biologically meaningful way, reducing guesswork.""

Beyond its scientific importance, the platform offers major economic advantages for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Better early-stage predictability can reduce costly late-stage failures, shorten development timelines, and lower overall research and development costs.

At the same time, more accurate early evaluation supports improved patient safety. Antibody candidates with higher risk profiles can be identified sooner, while the most promising therapies can move forward with greater confidence.

The approach also aligns with evolving expectations from regulatory authorities. Agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) increasingly promote the use of advanced, more predictive models to strengthen evidence before clinical testing.

The work was carried out by an international partnership between academic and industry experts, including VIB-Ghent University, argenx (Belgium), genOway (France), and Innate Pharma (France).

As antibody medicines continue to play a growing role in healthcare, this new platform offers a clearer and safer path from laboratory research to real treatments, helping effective therapies reach patients faster and at lower cost.

Interoceptive, visceral pain from within the body is perceived more unpleasant than exteroceptive pain from outside the body. A new study shows that the type of pain also influences how we empathize with others.

The type of pain influences how unpleasantly we perceive it: Visceral pain from inside the body, such as stomach ache, feels worse than somatic pain, like when we burn our finger. A medical study at Ruhr University Bochum has shown that this is not only the case when we are personally in pain, but it also influences empathy for pain when others are affected. We empathize more strongly with persons experiencing visceral pain, especially if we know them well. The team working with Dr. Milena Pertz from the Department of Medical Psychology and Medical Sociology reports its findings in the Journal of Pain from December 5, 2025.

The researchers recruited 30 healthy participants, all of whom were in a committed relationship for at least three months. The study was conducted on four days. On the first day, the researchers provided questionnaires and tasks to assess the participants' trait-empathy in everyday life. On the second day, the participants were exposed to various types of pain: a heat stimulus on the skin of the lower abdomen, and interoceptive visceral pain induced by pressure. The participants evaluated these two types of pain from their own perspective and from the perspective of both their Loved-one and an unknown individual. Six days later, they were asked to imagine how they personally, their Loved-one, and an unknown person would perceive the pain. The researchers determined how unpleasant the participants rated the pain, how personally aroused they felt by imagining pain for different people, and how much empathy they felt. Two days after this, the participants again rated their empathic responses when recalling the pain using online based ratings.

""The study shows that interoceptive, visceral pain induces stronger cognitive, affective, and empathic responses than does somatic pain. This is the case both from one's own perspective as well as when the participants imagined the pain for others,"" Pertz explains. The participants graded visceral pain as more intense and unpleasant than the pain caused by heat, and felt more empathic concern and personal distress, both for themselves and when imagining their Loved-one or a stranger experiencing such pain.

The effect was most pronounced when the participants considered their Loved-one's experience. This difference remained stable even in the absence of noxious stimulation eight days after painful stimuli were applied.""

Dr. Milena Pertz, Department of Medical Psychology and Medical Sociology, Ruhr University Bochum

The results help to understand how interoceptive bodily threats influence psychosocial behavior. The study also paves the way for future research into predictive factors for empathic reactions both in patients with pain as well as in the people who care for them, such as caregivers and healthcare professionals.

The work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft: project number 316803389 - SFB 1280.

An updated report on cystic fibrosis (CF) from Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, in partnership with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), highlights the new national guidelines on CF newborn screening that aim to detect affected babies earlier, more accurately and more fairly.

CF is a genetic disorder that causes problems with digestion and breathing, impacting about 40,000 children and adults in the United States. Currently, newborns in every state are screened for CF. However, great variation in practice and the genetic panels used contributes to missed and delayed diagnosis, which leads to worse outcomes.

Delays more often occur in diagnosis of infants who are Black, Hispanic, or Asian, in part because these groups tend to have CF-causing gene variants that are rarer and seldom included in the newborn screening panels. These infants frequently screen negative and get diagnosed much later when they exhibit symptoms.

""The new recommendations are designed to improve detection of CF in babies from all racial and ethnic backgrounds,"" said report co-author and co-senior author on the CF guidelines Susanna McColley, MD, an internationally recognized expert in CF newborn screening, pediatric pulmonologist at Lurie Children's and Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""The recommendations also aim to shorten time from birth to diagnosis and treatment, which has been shown to improve health for babies with CF.""

The recent CF report shows steady progress in identifying the illness earlier, within the first 28 days of life. In 2014, 40 percent of infants with CF were first seen for testing after this optimal timeframe. By 2024, the percentage dropped to 33 percent.

The improved timeliness in evaluation for CF is encouraging. However, we still see delays in a third of the cases, so more needs to be done to increase awareness among families and primary care providers that earlier diagnosis dramatically improves symptoms and ultimately survival.""

Dr. Susanna McColley, MD, pediatric pulmonologist at Lurie Children's and Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine

The report cites evidence that babies with CF who are diagnosed in the first two weeks of life have better nutrition at 1 and 5 years of age than babies who are diagnosed during the second month of life.

""Better nutrition means better growth and development for babies with CF, and with that comes better lung function and less severe disease trajectory,"" said Dr. McColley. ""We urge parents to work with their child's pediatric care provider to assure diagnostic evaluation for CF within a few days of a positive newborn screening test for CF, so that treatment can begin as soon as possible if their baby has CF.""

Dr. McColley also cautioned that CF newborn screening results can be false-negative, especially in infants who are Black or Asian. ""Infants of any race or background showing clinical signs of CF, including bowel obstruction and growth faltering, should be referred for diagnostic evaluation even if the newborn screening results are normal,"" she said.

Technology created at The University of Queensland could improve the odds of surviving brain cancer and change how we treat a range of neurological conditions.

Dr Richard Lobb and Dr Zhen Zhang from UQ's Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology have opened a ‘window to the brain' with a new diagnostic device that can tell how deadly brain tumours respond to treatment from a simple blood test.

The new device, called a Phenotype Analyzer Chip, was developed in the laboratory of ARC Laureate Professor Matt Trau and reads tiny biological particles in a patient's bloodstream to get fast and accurate information on glioblastoma.

Dr Lobb said Glioblastoma was the most common form of brain cancer in Australia and is considered particularly deadly because of its delicate location, aggressive growth and limitations in accurate therapeutic monitoring.

“There has been very little success so far in clinical trials for new and experimental glioblastoma treatments,” Dr Lobb said.

“That's partly because there is no way to tell if a therapy is working precisely as it should at that moment without drilling into someone's head.”

Dr Zhang said the Phenotype Analyzer Chip works by examining small samples of blood and capturing messenger cells known as extracellular vesicles that originate from glioblastoma tumour tissue.

“These particles cross the blood brain barrier laden with information on the disease, and with our hypersensitive device we can pick them up and interrogate them,” Dr Zhang said.

It's a completely new and non-invasive way of getting information on the brain.""

Dr Zhen Zhang, UQ's Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology

The device has been validated in more than 40 brain cancer patients and the Trau lab is now engaging with translational partners to implement the technology into clinical trials.

Professor Trau said glioblastoma patients usually had to wait until the later stages of the disease to check the therapeutic progress via MRI imaging.

“But by then it is often too late to pivot if these experimental therapies aren't working as hoped,” he said.

“What we're doing is getting clear, precise information on the disease as early as possible so we can better inform treatment pathways.

The Phenotype Analyzer Chip was developed in collaboration with researchers from the Mark Hughes Foundation Centre for Brain Cancer Research at the University of Newcastle using patient samples from the MHF Brain Cancer Biobank and with funding from the Mark Hughes Foundation.

University of Newcastle Professor Mike Fay, Director of the Mark Hughes Foundation Centre for Brain Cancer Research, said the technology would be particularly useful for regional patients who are usually forced to travel to metro areas for advanced medical treatment.

“We're really proud to partner with the team at UQ and to have contributed funding and clinical material to this important project,” Professor Fay said.

“A blood test for brain cancer will be a game-changer for patients, particularly those living in regional and remote areas.”

As well as monitoring brain cancers, Dr Lobb said the new chip also had the potential to unlock therapies for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Motor neurone disease (MND), and depression.

The hypersensitivity of the device, enabled through unique bionanotechnology innovations specifically developed in the Trau lab, makes it an ideal platform technology that could be tweaked to monitor other neurological disorders associated with inflammatory processes.

“In previous work we've shown it is possible to assess the impact of neuroinflammation triggered by traumatic brain injuries by reading brain-specific biomarkers,” Dr Lobb said.

“If we can capture and analyse the right extracellular vesicles in a patient's blood, we can get new information about the onset and mechanism of progression of a wide range of brain diseases.

“Glioblastoma really is just the beginning for this technology,"" 

The research is published in Science Advances.

Bats, critical reservoirs of viruses with significant cross-species spillover risks, have long been understudied in the Indochina Peninsula. A study led by researchers from Beijing University of Chemical Technology, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and their partners has unveiled the region's bat virome diversity, offering key insights into the origins of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and critical surveillance priorities.

From 2020 to 2024, the team analyzed 659 samples from 197 bats across 16 species using next-generation sequencing (NGS). They identified 137 viral strains across 27 families, including 40 novel species. Rhinolophidae bats from China's Yunnan and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region provinces exhibited the highest viral diversity, with 13 viral families and MERS-like coronaviruses. In contrast, Cambodian bats harbored viruses that were evolutionarily distant from known strains.

A notable discovery was a PEDV-related virus in Cambodian Chaerephon plicatus bats. This virus (CB_Mo.plicatus_PEDV-like_1) shared 90.36% genome homology with the PEDV CV777 strain and displayed a recombinant structure, combining suid-adapted ORF1ab and bat-adapted Spike genes. This finding further strengthens the evidence of bats as the potential evolutionary source of PEDV. Recombination analysis of 18 sequences revealed mosaicism in 16, with five regions showing no breakpoints (BFRs), emphasizing the frequency of viral genetic exchange.

Deep learning models further highlighted host adaptation risks. The ORF1ab of the PEDV-related virus showed a preference for suids (pigs), while its Spike gene favored bats, raising concerns about potential spillover if mutations occur.

Our findings underscore critical surveillance gaps. The unique ecology of the Indochina Peninsula drives viral diversity and recombination. We call for enhanced cross-border 'One Health' initiatives targeting bat-human interfaces and recombination hotspots to prevent future zoonotic outbreaks.""

Ascending aortic hemiarch reconstruction offers the same long-term benefits to patients over age 65 with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) as more complex extended arch reconstruction procedures, according to a study presented today at the 2026 Society of Thoracic Surgeons Annual Meeting.

The finding came from a risk-adjusted analysis of 3,562 patients examining long-term survival and surgical reintervention for aortic disease following initial operation for ATAAD. Patient data came from the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (ACSD), containing nearly 8.5 million adult cardiac surgery procedure records and linked to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services database. Of the ATAAD patients studied, 74.2% underwent aortic hemiarch replacement and 25.8% underwent extended arch reconstruction at a US hospital between July 2017 and December 2023.

Aortic dissection occurs when a tear in the inner lining of the aorta, the largest blood vessel in the body, allows blood to flow inside the aortic wall and ""dissect"" the layers apart, which dramatically increases the risk of aortic rupture and interruption of blood flow to the affected portions of the body. Acute dissections affecting the ascending aorta usually require emergency surgery, often in patients aged 65 or older. Cardiovascular surgeons have many options when planning surgery for these patients, said John R. Spratt, MD, clinical assistant professor of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at University of Florida Health, a center with one of the highest aortic surgery volumes in the nation. 

Ascending hemiarch replacement involves replacement of the ascending aorta and the underside of the first portion of the aortic arch and is considered to have lower operative risk and complexity compared with extended arch reconstruction. Extended arch reconstruction describes any procedure involving replacement of the ascending aorta, partial or total replacement of the transverse arch, and re-implantation of one or more arch vessels. Depending on the technique used, most extended arch reconstructions carry greater short-term operative risk due to the need for longer periods of cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiac arrest, and more advanced forms of cerebral protection that are needed during the procedure compared with ascending hemiarch reconstruction.

Patients with aortic dissection can require additional aortic operations later in life, even if the initial dissection repair was successful. Extended arch reconstruction may decrease the long-term risk of requiring additional open aortic surgery. However, older patients have a shorter overall life expectancy and the extent to which they can reap these benefits is unclear."" 

 John R. Spratt, MD, clinical assistant professor of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, University of Florida Health

In the six years of data reviewed in the study, extended arch reconstruction for acute dissection in patients over the age of 65 did not confer any long-term advantage regarding survival or rates of undergoing additional aortic surgery compared to the hemiarch procedure.

 ""It is important to balance what the 'ideal' reconstruction may be when reviewing a CT scan with the overall risk profile of an individual patient. Based on our analysis, most patients age 65 and older undergoing repair of acute dissection will be fine with hemiarch reconstruction and have the same long-term outcomes as they would with a higher-risk procedure,"" said Spratt.

The ACSD is part of the STS National Database, one of the largest and most comprehensive clinical registries with nearly 10 million cardiothoracic procedures performed by 4,300+ surgeons. With more than 95% of adult cardiac surgery procedures and the largest and most robust clinical thoracic surgical database in the US, data and outcomes from the STS Database provide true national benchmarks for clinical outcomes of cardiothoracic surgery.

A controlled crossover trial finds that short-term consumption of unprocessed beef is on par with poultry for glucose control, β-cell function, and cardiometabolic markers in people with prediabetes.

Study: Effects of Diets Containing Beef Compared with Poultry on Pancreatic β-Cell Function and Other Cardiometabolic Health Indicators in Males and Females with Prediabetes: A Randomized, Crossover Trial. Image credit: Nitr/Shutterstock.com

In a recent study published in Current Developments in Nutrition, researchers examined whether consuming unprocessed beef affects metabolic outcomes in prediabetic adults. Comparing beef intake with poultry intake over 28 days, they found no evidence of differences in blood lipids, inflammatory biomarkers, glucoregulatory hormones, measures of glucose regulation, and pancreatic β-cell function.

Observational studies have frequently linked higher red meat consumption with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, while poultry intake has shown neutral or inverse associations. However, randomized controlled trials have generally not found evidence that red meat harms glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, or glycated hemoglobin.

This discrepancy suggests that observed associations may reflect residual confounding from lifestyle and dietary patterns rather than a causal effect of red meat itself. Type 2 diabetes develops through a combination of insulin resistance and progressive pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, yet relatively few intervention studies have directly examined how red meat intake influences β-cell function.

β-cell activity is regulated not only by glucose levels but also by glucoregulatory hormones and inflammatory processes, which may, in turn, be influenced by dietary protein sources. Existing studies are limited by methodological differences, limited statistical power to detect small effects, and confounding dietary substitutions.

Researchers compared the effects of poultry and beef intake under controlled conditions on pancreatic β-cell function and related metabolic outcomes in prediabetic adults.

They conducted a randomized, crossover design in accordance with established guidelines and ethical standards, with institutional review board approval and written informed consent from all participants. Adults aged 18–74 years with overweight or obesity and prediabetes were eligible.

Key exclusion criteria included diagnosed diabetes, major chronic disease, recent weight change, use of medications affecting metabolism, restrictive diets, or pregnancy. Participants were randomly assigned to consume either beef- or poultry-based entrées for 28 days, followed by a 28-day washout period and crossover to the alternate condition. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible.

Participants maintained their usual diet and lifestyle throughout the study, except for avoiding non-study meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs during treatment periods. Two standardized study entrées were provided per day, each containing approximately 3–3.5 ounces of cooked beef or poultry. Adherence was assessed through returned entrées and three-day diet records.

The primary outcome was pancreatic β-cell function, assessed as the ratio of the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for C-peptide to glucose during a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT).

Other outcomes included postprandial and fasting glucose, glucagon, C-peptide, insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), insulin sensitivity indices, lipoprotein lipids, and inflammatory biomarkers. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of each intervention period.

Statistical analyses used repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline values as covariates. Log transformations were applied where necessary, and results were reported as least squares geometric means.

Of 43 individuals screened, 29 were randomized, and 24 completed the study. Participants were predominantly male, middle-aged, and had overweight or obesity with prediabetes. Adherence to the provided entrées was high (>99 %) in both conditions, and few adverse events were reported.

Dietary analysis showed modest differences between conditions, with higher saturated fat intake during the beef phase and higher carbohydrate and protein intake during the poultry phase.

Despite these differences, there were no statistically significant differences between poultry and beef intake for the primary outcome of pancreatic β-cell function, as measured by the C-peptide-to-glucose iAUC ratio.

Additionally, no differences were observed for fasting or postprandial glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, or GIP responses. Measures of insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, and alternative β-cell function indices were also similar between conditions. A single difference emerged in an exploratory per-protocol sensitivity analysis for one postprandial C-peptide measure, but the authors noted that this did not alter the overall interpretation of the findings.

Lipoprotein lipid levels, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol, did not differ between interventions. Biomarkers of inflammation likewise showed no significant differences. Overall, metabolic responses to beef and poultry consumption were comparable across all measured outcomes.

This study found no evidence that short-term consumption of unprocessed beef, compared with poultry, was associated with differences in pancreatic β-cell function, glucose regulation, lipid profiles, or inflammatory biomarkers in prediabetic adults.

These findings align with prior randomized trials and meta-analyses showing that red meat has a neutral effect on cardiometabolic risk factors. They contrast with associations observed in cross-sectional studies, which may be confounded by lifestyle factors.

Key strengths include the randomized crossover design, high adherence, and comprehensive assessment of glucoregulatory hormones. However, the findings are limited by the short intervention duration, inability to blind participants, reliance on self-reported dietary adherence, the modest sample size, and limited generalizability beyond unprocessed meats, a predominantly male population, and individuals with prediabetes. Participants were also free-living, limiting the ability to exert full dietary control.

The study was funded by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association through the Beef Checkoff program; the sponsor had no role in data collection, analysis, interpretation, or publication decisions.

These results indicate that unprocessed beef can be included in a habitual diet without detectable short-term differences in cardiometabolic risk markers relative to poultry under the conditions tested. The authors note that the study was not designed to detect small or long-term effects, and longer-term studies in more diverse populations are warranted to confirm these findings.

By analyzing tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease, and animal and cellular models of the disease, a research team from the Institut de Neurociències of the UAB has shown that the main immune cells of the brain become reactive and overexpress certain receptors that promote the elimination of dopaminergic neurons, even when these neurons are still functional. The study points to a new immunotherapy approach that could help preserve viable neurons in people with this diagnosis.

Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in a specific brain region known as the substantia nigra. This neuronal degeneration is closely linked to inflammatory processes mediated by microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system. However, the precise mechanisms that trigger this destructive process are still not fully understood.

Now, in an article published in npj Parkinson's Disease, researchers from the Institut de Neurociències of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (INc-UAB) and the UAB Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology report that brain tissue from Parkinson's disease patients contains a higher proportion of reactive microglia, meaning cells that are primed to respond. But most importantly, these reactive microglial cells also show an increased density of receptors known as Fc gamma on their membranes.

Under normal conditions, Fc gamma receptors help identify damaged cells or harmful components that need to be removed from the brain, triggering the normal microglia's cleaning response. However, the INc-UAB team suggests that in Parkinson's disease, these overexpressed receptors mistakenly identify still-functional neurons as damaged, setting off an inappropriate elimination process.

According to the study, when Fc gamma receptors are activated upon detecting dopaminergic neurons, even those that are still functioning, they cause the microglial cell to change shape through the activation of a cytoskeletal protein called Cdc42. This allows the microglia to surround the target neuron and literally ""eat"" it, in a process known as phagocytosis.

What is particularly interesting is that in animal and cellular models of the disease, blocking Fc gamma receptors with immunotherapy, as well as pharmacologically inhibiting Cdc42, significantly reduced the elimination of dopaminergic neurons, preserving them even under conditions of intense neuroinflammation.""

Carlos Barcia, coordinator of the study

These findings suggest that regulating microglial phagocytosis through immunotherapy targeting Fc gamma receptors, or their downstream signaling protein Cdc42, could slow disease progression and help protect the function of remaining dopaminergic neurons.

A national clinical trial led by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology has found that oxybutynin, a drug often used to treat overactive bladder symptoms, reduces hot flashes compared to the placebo in men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer. This primary analysis of Alliance A222001 is published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Oxybutynin demonstrated clear and clinically meaningful improvements in both hot flash frequency and quality of life for men undergoing hormone therapy for prostate cancer. These results provide strong support for its use as an effective management option for this challenging and often overlooked side effect of prostate cancer treatment.""

Bradley J. Stish, MD, study's lead investigator and radiation oncologist, Mayo Clinic

Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective treatment against prostate cancer as it lowers male hormones like testosterone needed to fuel cancer cells. However, ADT causes hot flashes in up to 80 percent of the men who take it, leading to fatigue, sleep disturbances and reduced quality of life, often leading patients to discontinue ADT due to the side effects.

The Phase II randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial evaluated whether two doses of oxybutynin (2.5 mg twice daily and 5 mg twice daily) could improve hot flash symptoms compared with placebo over six weeks. The study enrolled 88 men from 15 academic and community cancer centers; 81 participants were eligible for final analysis. The average age of the participants was 68.5.

In this trial, both doses of oxybutynin substantially improved hot flash symptoms compared to the placebo over the six‑week treatment period. Men receiving placebo experienced an average reduction of 2.15 hot flashes per day and a 4.85‑point drop in daily hot flash severity scores, whereas those taking 2.5 mg of oxybutynin twice daily reported reductions of 4.77 hot flashes per day and a 9.94‑point decrease in severity, and those receiving 5 mg twice daily experienced the largest improvements, with 6.89 fewer hot flashes per day and a 13.95‑point reduction in severity.

Improvements occurred quickly, often during the first week of treatment, and were sustained throughout the study. The proportion of patients achieving at least a 50 percent reduction in hot flash scores was also markedly higher with oxybutynin: 57 percent in the 2.5 mg group and 79 percent in the 5 mg group, compared with 32 percent taking placebo. Treatment was well tolerated overall. Dry mouth was the most common side effect reported.

""These results are incredibly encouraging,"" added Dr. Stish. ""Men with hot flashes from hormone therapy now have another therapeutic option available to help reduce their symptom burden. Future research will look to further our understanding of hot flash therapy options in this patient population.""

In addition to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, investigators on the study included scientists from the Alliance Protocol Operations in Chicago, IL; Alliance Statistics and Data Management Center at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, AZ; Aspirus Regional Cancer Center in Wausau, WI; Ellis Fischel Cancer Center in Columbia, MO; Georgetown-Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC; Gibbs Cancer Center in Spartanburg, SC; Mayo Clinic Division of Nursing in Jacksonville, FL; Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, NY; SCOR-Messino Cancer Centers in Ashville, NC; Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center in Baltimore, MD; The Ohio State University in Columbus, OH; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Religious faith linked to lower psychological distress during Covid-19 lockdown","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260201/Religious-faith-linked-to-lower-psychological-distress-during-Covid-19-lockdown.aspx","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 02:17:00 GMT","

Two Cambridge-led studies suggest that the psychological distress caused by lockdowns (UK) and experience of infection (US) was reduced among those of faith compared to non-religious people.  

People of religious faith may have experienced lower levels of unhappiness and stress than secular people during the UK's Covid-19 lockdowns in 2020 and 2021, according to a new University of Cambridge study released as a working paper.

The findings follow recently published Cambridge-led research suggesting that worsening mental health after experiencing Covid infection - either personally or in those close to you - was also somewhat ameliorated by religious belief. This study looked at the US population during early 2021.

University of Cambridge economists argue that - taken together - these studies show that religion may act as a bulwark against increased distress and reduced wellbeing during times of crisis, such as a global public health emergency.

Selection biases make the wellbeing effects of religion difficult to study. People may become religious due to family backgrounds, innate traits, or to cope with new or existing struggles.""

Prof Shaun Larcom from Cambridge's Department of Land Economy, and co-author of the latest study

""However, the Covid-19 pandemic was an extraordinary event affecting everyone at around the same time, so we could gauge the impact of a negative shock to wellbeing right across society. This provided a unique opportunity to measure whether religion was important for how some people deal with a crisis.""

Larcom and his Cambridge colleagues Prof Sriya Iyer and Dr Po-Wen She analyzed survey data collected from 3,884 people in the UK during the first two national lockdowns, and compared it to three waves of data prior to the pandemic.

They found that while lockdowns were associated with a universal uptick in unhappiness, the average increase in feeling miserable was 29% lower for people who described themselves as belonging to a religion.

The researchers also analyzed the data by ""religiosity"": the extent of an individual's commitment to religious beliefs, and how central it is to their life. Those for whom religion makes ""some or a great difference"" in their lives experienced around half the increase in unhappiness seen in those for whom religion makes little or no difference.

""The study suggests that it is not just being religious, but the intensity of religiosity that is important when coping with a crisis,"" said Larcom.

Those self-identifying as religious in the UK are more likely to have certain characteristics, such as being older and female. The research team ""controlled"" for these statistically to try and isolate the effects caused by faith alone, and still found that the probability of religious people having an increase in depression was around 20% lower than non-religious people.

There was little overall difference between Christians, Muslims and Hindus - followers of the three biggest religions in the UK. However, the team did find that wellbeing among some religious groups appeared to suffer more than others when places of worship were closed during the first lockdown.

""The denial of weekly communal attendance appears to have been particularly affecting for Catholics and Muslims,"" said Larcom.

For the earlier study, authored by Prof Sriya Iyer, along with colleagues Kishen Shastry, Girish Bahal and Anand Shrivastava from Australia and India, researchers used online surveys to investigate Covid-19 infections among respondents or their immediate family and friends, as well as religious beliefs, and mental health. 

The study was conducted during February and March 2021, and involved 5,178 people right across the United States, with findings published in the journal European Economic Review in November 2023.

Researchers found that almost half those who reported a Covid-19 infection either in themselves or their immediate social network experienced an associated reduction in wellbeing.

Where mental health declined, it was around 60% worse on average for the non-religious compared to people of faith with typical levels of ""religiosity"".

Interestingly, the positive effects of religion were not found in areas with strictest lockdowns, suggesting access to places of worship might be even more important in a US context. The study also found significant uptake of online religious services, and a 40% lower association between Covid-19 and mental health for those who used them.

""Religious beliefs may be used by some as psychological resources that can shore up self-esteem and add coping skills, combined with practices that provide social support,"" said Prof Iyer, from Cambridge's Faculty of Economics.

""The pandemic presented an opportunity to glean further evidence of this in both the United Kingdom and the United States, two nations characterised by enormous religious diversity."" 

Added Larcom: ""These studies show a relationship between religion and lower levels of distress during a global crisis. It may be that religious faith builds resilience, and helps people cope with adversity by providing hope, consolation and meaning in tumultuous times.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Scientists create new map showing how cancer gene mutations influence tumor growth","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260202/Scientists-create-new-map-showing-how-cancer-gene-mutations-influence-tumor-growth.aspx","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:01:00 GMT","

Scientists have created a complete map showing how hundreds of possible mutations in a key cancer gene influence tumor growth.

The study focused on CTNNB1, a gene that produces the protein β-catenin, which helps regulate tissue growth and repair. When β-catenin is disrupted, cells can begin uncontrolled growth – a hallmark of cancer.

By systematically testing all possible mutations in a priority area of the gene in mouse cells, the map helps explain why certain mutations appear in specific cancers and could guide the development of new treatments, experts say.

Many cancers carry mutations in a small 'hotspot' region of CTNNB1. Normally, this region acts like a tag that marks β-catenin for destruction when it is no longer needed.

Mutations in the hotspot remove this tag, causing β-catenin to accumulate and activate genes that drive tumor growth. More than 70 different mutations have been observed within this hotspot in different types of cancer, but it was not known whether different mutations influenced cancer growth in different ways.

In the study, researchers from the University of Edinburgh tested all 342 possible single changes in this hotspot using mouse stem cells. These cells are particularly well suited to precise genome editing, and β-catenin signalling is highly conserved between mice and humans.

Using genome-editing tools and a fluorescent test, the team measured how strongly each mutation activates the β-catenin pathway – a signalling system that switches on genes driving cell growth. The results showed wide variation: some mutations only slightly increased β-catenin activity, while others activated the pathway strongly.

By comparing their results with genetic data from thousands of cancer patients, the researchers showed that the mutation scores accurately predicted the effects of β-catenin mutations in people. The analysis also revealed that cancers arising in different tissues tend to select mutations that generate different levels of β-catenin activity.

In liver cancer, two major groups of tumours emerged: those with weaker CTNNB1 mutations, which contained more immune cells, and those with stronger mutations, which had fewer. Researchers say this suggests that mutation strength may influence how a tumor interacts with the immune system – and potentially how it responds to immunotherapy.

The new map provides a powerful tool for predicting how specific CTNNB1 mutations affect cancer behaviour and could support the development of more personalized treatments. As the first study to experimentally test every possible mutation in this critical hotspot, it gives scientists a clearer picture of how β-catenin drives tumor growth across different cancer types.""

In the continuously changing environment of drug development and molecular biology, sensitive and high-throughput kinase activity monitoring remains a key component of target validation and inhibitor screening.

Kinases, which catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to protein, lipid, or nucleotide substrates, play a critical role in signal transmission, cell cycle control, and metabolic regulation.

Dysregulated kinase activity has been linked to a variety of human diseases, including cancers, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative ailments, due to its key role in cellular physiology.1,2

SwiftFluo® TR-FRET kinase kits provide a highly sensitive, selective, simple, and rapid assay platform to help researchers decode kinase biology while also expediting small molecule drug discovery and lead optimization.

These kits, based on advanced time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) technology, are especially optimized for profiling 60+ tyrosine kinases (TKs), 150+ serine/threonine kinases (STKs), and 15+ cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), providing flexibility across diverse target classes and screening strategies.

The SwiftFluo® TK and STK platforms use a ""sandwich"" immunoassay method, with the enzyme phosphorylating a biotinylated substrate during the kinase reaction.

The phosphorylated product is subsequently recognized by a phospho-specific antibody tagged with Solar Eu (donor) and collected using a streptavidin-linked acceptor (HX or LA).

When the donor and acceptor are in close proximity, resonance energy transfer occurs, resulting in an emission of 620/665 nm. The strength of the TR-FRET signal is directly proportional to the level of phosphorylated substrate.

The SwiftFluo® CDK kits, on the other hand, use a streamlined dual-component system that includes a TR-FRET donor-labeled phospho-specific antibody and a directly acceptor-labeled protein substrate (Rb [S780] and ATF2 [T71]), allowing for the rapid and sensitive quantification of CDK target activity (CDK1, 2, 5, 9, etc.).

SwiftFluo® kinase kits provide a homogeneous assay format for accurate measurement of kinase activity.

In contrast to typical FRET tests reliant on short-lived fluorescent dyes that frequently suffer from quick signal attenuation, strong background interference, and photobleaching under repeated excitation, TR FRET uses lanthanide donors such as europium (Eu) or terbium (Tb).

These donors have extremely long fluorescence lifetimes (up to 1-2 ms) and excellent photostability, practically eliminating signal loss due to photobleaching. Background autofluorescence from assay components and biological samples is significantly reduced by delaying excitation and emission detection.

With this low interference, TR FRET has significantly improved signal-to-noise ratios and provides consistent, reproducible readouts, ideal for high-throughput kinase profiling and inhibitor screening.

SwiftFluo® TR-FRET assays have many benefits over other detection methods:

SwiftFluo® TR-FRET assays have several advantages over other platforms. They are not affected by kinase autophosphorylation, unlike ADP-Glo™ assays. Additionally, unlike ELISA or MSD, they do not require wash steps, resulting in a more efficient workflow and increased test throughput.

The SwiftFluo® TR-FRET kinase assay family is designed to enable a broad range of applications, including early-stage kinase profiling, HTS, and hit validation. With coverage of main kinase classes (TKs, STKs, and CDKs), the platform provides flexibility and scalability for a variety of drug development activities.

These kits have been previously validated with substrates, antibodies, and buffers tuned for over 200 kinases, including disease-relevant targets such as EGFR, FLT3, JAK2, BRK, AMPK, ROCK1, CDK1, CDK5, and many more.

TKs and STKs kits can be used to support a broad-spectrum kinase panel or a specialized substrate-based application.

The SwiftFluo® TR-FRET kinase kits are ideal for enzymatic activity validation, allowing researchers to characterize recombinant kinases and ensure lot-to-lot uniformity.

The kits enable reproducible dose-response tests with excellent signal stability for IC50 and EC50 assessments, making it easier to assess compound potency.

They are also suitable for developing a uniform screening platform in which the same assay format may be used for TKs, STKs, and CDKs, with optimum conditions specific to each kinase class to enable consistent kinase profiling.

In addition, the kits' uniform, no-wash structure and robust assay performance make them ideal for industrial HTS studies that require rapid triaging of chemical libraries.

The assay is fully compatible with microplate readers equipped with a TR-FRET detection module and can be scaled to 96-, 384-, and 1536-well plates, allowing for simple incorporation into automated screening workflows.

A new review finds that while the carnivore diet may deliver short-term improvements, weak evidence and emerging risks make long-term adherence a gamble for health.

 Study: Carnivore Diet: A Scoping Review of the Current Evidence, Potential Benefits and Risks. Image Credit: Fascinadora / Shutterstock.com

In a recent review published in Nutrients, researchers determined the nutritional adequacy and health effects of the carnivore diet (CD).

The CD is characterized by minimally processed animal-based foods like fish, meat, eggs, seafood, animal fats, and full-fat dairy products, and, as a result, can also be considered a low-carbohydrate/high-fat dietary pattern. The CD has been claimed to be associated with numerous health benefits, including weight reduction, self-reported improvements in physical and cognitive performance, and a reported reduction in the risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and gastrointestinal disorders.

These purported benefits are attributed to the lack of exposure to antinutritional compounds (ANs) found in plant-based foods, including enzyme inhibitors, lectins, phytic acid, oxalic acid, tannins, goitrogens, and saponins, which are secondary plant metabolites that may interfere with nutrient absorption.

Importantly, the lack of plant-based foods in the CD also prevents intake of important phytochemicals, dietary fiber, and essential micronutrients. Furthermore, the high intake of animal-based foods, particularly red and processed meat, is consistently associated, in broader epidemiological studies, with a greater risk of cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, and mortality.

The researchers of the current study reviewed available literature to determine the nutritional adequacy and health effects of following a CD. Studies reporting 10 % or more of energy intake from plant-based foods, in vitro studies, preprints, animal studies, reviews, conference papers, book chapters, and unpublished studies were excluded from the analysis. Search results were deduplicated, and titles/abstracts were screened to exclude non-relevant records.

Full texts of the remaining studies were analyzed, and relevant data were extracted and synthesized. Overall, nine eligible studies published between 2021 and 2025 were analyzed, of which included five case studies, two surveys, one comparative modeling study, and one exploratory study. Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in the United States, with the definition of CD varying across studies.

All but three studies completely excluded plant-based foods. Four studies explicitly focused on red meat, two of which emphasized high-fat meat intake, and one on lean meat intake.

In one study, CD was used as an elimination diet but was subsequently transitioned to a ketogenic meat-centered pattern. Similarly, another study evaluated a ketogenic CD variant. In one survey, respondents followed a zero-carbohydrate diet that primarily involved meat, including organ meats.

Three studies examined health status, dietary behaviors, and sociodemographic and anthropometric features using questionnaires. Two studies developed and assessed theoretical dietary plans based on nutrient intake, rather than the healthy eating index or dietary reference values (DRVs).

Furthermore, three studies evaluated the effects of CD on urological, gynecological, and gastrointestinal conditions. One study compared the functionality and diversity of the gut microbiome between an omnivorous diet and CD.

In two studies, multiple nutrients were categorized as insufficient compared to DRVs. More specifically, reported intakes were below the DRVs for thiamin, magnesium, iron, calcium, potassium, iodine, folate, and vitamins C and D.

Whereas dietary fiber intake was lower than recommended levels, vitamin A intake exceeded recommended levels, particularly in diets high in liver-derived retinol. Four studies reported self-reported or clinically observed positive effects on disease course, allowing for discontinuation or reduction of medication in some cases. In one study, several laboratory parameters, including the triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, C-reactive protein, and γ-glutamyl transferase, improved during CD.

Another study reported improvements in iron status and reductions in fecal calprotectin in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. However, both studies also observed increases in total cholesterol (TC), platelet counts, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Triglycerides and glycated hemoglobin improved in individuals with metabolic disorders who initiated CD, although LDL-C and TC were significantly elevated.

One case report observed deterioration of the patient's health while following the CD, with an unfavorable 24-hour urine profile. One year after CD cessation, this patient no longer experienced kidney stones.

One study found no significant differences in gut microbiome diversity and functionality between an omnivorous diet and CD. Motivations for adopting a CD included perceived health benefits, and to a lesser extent, ethical considerations, and perceptions of naturalness.

Many people reported improvements in overall health while emphasizing the simplicity of the diet and positive sensory experience associated with consuming animal-based foods. Notably, one study found that people following a zero-carbohydrate/CD lifestyle often had social conflict outside the CD community, including challenges interacting with healthcare professionals and tensions within friendship and family networks.

Following the CD may provide short-term health improvements, with these effects likely attributed to placebo responses, subjective perceptions, and ketosis-related metabolic adaptations. However, the CD may increase the risk of cardiovascular and renal complications, as well as micronutrient deficiencies, low fiber intake, and adverse lipid profile changes.

Due to limitations in the existing scientific evidence on CD, including the lack of control groups, short intervention durations, and small sample sizes, it is not possible to assess the long-term safety of CD. Thus, long-term adherence cannot be recommended.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Zoey Deutch Takes the Field in Netflix's U.S. Women's Soccer Drama THE 99'ERS","https://geektyrant.com/news/zoey-deutch-takes-the-field-in-netflixs-us-womens-soccer-drama-the-99ers","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:02:00 GMT","

Netflix is gearing up to tell one of the most important sports stories ever put on screen, and it's found its lead. Zoey Deutch has officially signed on to star in The 99'ers, a new U.S. Women's Soccer drama headed to the streamer and directed by Emmy winner Nicole Kassell.

In the film, Deutch will play Marla Messing, the forward-thinking U.S. Women's Soccer executive who helped engineer the historic 1999 World Cup tournament. That event didn't just crown champions, it shattered attendance records, dominated TV ratings, and changed how the world viewed women's sports. It's a big role with real weight behind it, and Deutch feels like a smart choice to anchor the story.

This project also marks another reunion between Deutch and Netflix. She recently starred as Jean Seberg in Richard Linklater's Nouvelle Vague, which earned her an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Performance. She's also appeared in Set It Up opposite Glen Powell and has the upcoming rom-com Voicemails for Isabelle on the way.

People We Meet on Vacation star Emily Bader is also part of the cast, stepping into the cleats of soccer icon Mia Hamm. The film pulls its inspiration from Jeré Longman's 2000 HarperPerennial book The Girls of Summer: The U.S. Women's Soccer Team and How It Changed the World, and zeroes in on that unforgettable summer of 1999.

The story follows the 1990s U.S. Women's National Soccer Team as they battle all expectations and face China in a nerve-shredding penalty kick shootout during the World Cup final. 

Played under brutal heat in front of 93,000 fans, the match drew millions of viewers worldwide and ended with a victory that reshaped the future of women's athletics. That moment didn't fade with time. It became a cultural milestone.

The screenplay comes from a stacked group of writers including Katie Lovejoy, Dana Stevens, and Peter Hedges, with Jill Mazursky and Jamee Decio credited as the first writers on the project. 

Outside of The 99'ers, Deutch has been busy. She was recently in Park City supporting Celebrity Sex Pass, a Sundance comedy directed by David Wain, where she stars alongside Jon Hamm and John Slattery. 

The 99'ers isn't just about winning a championship. It's about visibility, belief, and a group of women who forced the sports world to pay attention. With Deutch leading the charge and Kassell at the helm, this Netflix film has a real shot at doing justice to a story that still hits hard decades later.

The goals kept coming for three USMNT stars at the weekend, while one American manager continued to make headlines for his unbeaten start to life in Spain.

“We didn't start the year so well, but I think we're slowly finding our feet again.”

Malik Tillman's assessment of Bayer Leverkusen's improving fortunes could just as well apply to his own spell at the Bundesliga club.

Advertisement

Arriving in a €35million (£30m/$41m) summer deal, the USMNT midfielder was given the departing Florian Wirtz's No 10 shirt and tasked with somehow replacing the German's considerable influence.

At times during his first few months at the club, that burden of responsibility seemed to weigh heavily.

It was not helped by Leverkusen firing the manager who signed him, Erik ten Hag, after just two league games in charge.

Leverkusen looked some way off the side that finished first and second in their previous two campaigns. Like everyone at the club, Tillman was affected by the tumult.

But the 23-year-old did not take too long to find his feet. That testing autumn came and went, with an injury causing him to miss three league games and a 7-2 thrashing in the Champions League by PSV.

But he marked his return to the starting line-up on November 22 with a goal against Wolfsburg in a 3-1 win, and began to show his talent consistently thereafter.

Last week, he repeated a feat he achieved when he became the first American to score twice in a Champions League game. This time, he struck two goals as Leverkusen beat Villarreal 3-0 and booked their place in the competition's play-off stage (and a double-header against Greek side Olympiacos).

Just to underline how he is flourishing, Tillman scored again on Saturday and was in good spirits after the game against Eintracht Frankfurt.

“It's about time I scored more often,” he told the club website after that third goal in two games. “We didn't start the year so well, but I think we're slowly finding our feet again. And every win obviously boosts our confidence. Hopefully it continues like this.”

Tillman's confidence is peaking and his admiring manager did not hold back with his praise.

“He's a top player,” boss Kasper Hjulmand told German newspaper Bild. “He has superb technique, he's intelligent. Now he's fully arrived.”

Another American who has emerged as a force for his club after a big summer move is Patrick Agyemang.

The 25-year-old has had a swift rise from college soccer in Rhode Island four years ago to the highly competitive English second tier in the summer.

And he has taken it all in his stride. After grabbing attention in the MLS with Charlotte, he has impressed in England's Championship and on Friday scored his ninth league goal of the season for promotion-chasing Derby County in a 5-0 win at Bristol City.

That tally may well have played the 6ft 4in (193cm) forward back into contention for the USMNT roster for their friendly with Belgium in March after missing November's wins over Paraguay and Uruguay.

Weston McKennie is at a different stage of his career to Tillman and Agyemang.

The 27-year-old has already proven himself for club and country, and has played in the Premier League, Bundesliga and Serie A.

But he is far from resting on his laurels. McKennie is one of the Italian top flight's most in-form players, and stamped his influence on the Champions League with three goals in consecutive games during the group phase.

On Sunday, he scored again in Juventus' 4-1 win over Parma. And he was quick to credit manager Luciano Spalletti with being a big influence.

“Spalletti is unique, as I have never in my career worked with a coach like this,” he told DAZN Italy. “He is so good, works with the team spirit. I'm really happy and I think everyone here is happy to be working with him.”

In France's Ligue 1, Folarin Balogun got an assist as Monaco beat Rennes 4-0 at Stade Louis II.

The USMNT striker could do with increasing his domestic scoring rate, though. He hasn't scored in the league for Monaco since November, even if he has managed some crucial goals in their Champions League campaign.

In Germany, it's DFB-Pokal time. See if Tillman can continue his impressive form when Leverkusen take on James Sands' St Pauli in the cup quarter-final (Tuesday, 2:45pm ET, ESPN+)

Joe Scally has been a regular for Borussia Monchengladbach, where injury is again restricting Gio Reyna. The former will hope to be influential as his team faces Tillman and Leverkusen on Saturday in the Bundesliga (12:30pm, ESPN+).

Tune in next Monday to see if Alex Freeman, who joined Villarreal from Orlando City last week, can make his La Liga debut against Espanyol (Monday, 3pm, ESPN+). He was an unused sub for his new club in their draw with Osasuna on Saturday.

Staying with Spain, it is worth keeping an eye on Real Sociedad. They face Osasuna in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals on Tuesday, and their American manager Pellegrino Matarazzo is having a strong start to life at his new club.

Last week, Matarazzo was named manager of the month for January after a five-game unbeaten spell as boss, which has seen La Real take 10 points out of a possible 12 in La Liga. The run has included a victory over leaders Barcelona. See if he can keep that up in the cup (Tuesday, 3pm, ESPN app).

Finally, Christian Pulisic and Milan are back in Serie A action tomorrow against Bologna (Tuesday, 2:45pm, Paramount +).

Soccer America


					Home for America's Passionate Soccer Fans				

At its 30th Anniversary Celebration, the U.S. Soccer Foundation honored the USA's 1994 World Cup coach Bora Milutinovic and Kenneth C. Griffin, the foundation's most impactful philanthropist.

Griffin, the founder and CEO of Citadel and the founder of Griffin Catalyst, was recognized for his support, which has created 100 mini‑pitches throughout Chicago and Miami — turning schoolyards and neighborhood spaces into hubs for more than 100,000 kids and families. He received the No. 10 Award.

More than 850 mini-pitches have been created across the nation by the U.S. Soccer Foundation, which was set up as a perpetual foundation with the 1994 World Cup surplus of over $50 million ($111 million in 2025 dollars).

World Cup

SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles will host eight 2026 World Cup games, including two U.S. group matches Patrick T. Fallon / AFP / Getty Images

The Athletic has live coverage of the latest news for the 2026 World Cup. 

FIFA is selling parking passes at 2026 World Cup games in Los Angeles for $250 or $300 per matchday and per spot — more than the price of some actual match tickets.

The passes are for parking spaces more than a mile away from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., according to listings on FIFA's “official World Cup 2026 parking website.”

SoFi will host eight World Cup matches, including the U.S. team's opener and a quarterfinal. For those two matches, a single parking spot is priced at $300. For the other six, including Iran vs. New Zealand and the third U.S. group match, a pass costs $250. (A Category 3 ticket to some of those matches costs $140 or $180.)

A FIFA spokesperson, when asked to justify the prices, told The Athletic that “parking prices are determined based on local market conditions and benchmarking against comparable major events previously held in each host city.”

The $250 spots appear to be in or near the “VIP West Garage” at the Intuit Dome, the Los Angeles Clippers basketball arena, which is just outside SoFi Stadium's Hollywood Park campus. FIFA's parking website, which is operated by JustPark, estimates that the walk from parking spot to stadium would take 21 minutes, though the exact length would depend on security checkpoints, entrances and other factors.

For Clippers games, parking in the garage costs $56.50; and for the upcoming NBA All-Star Game, it costs $88.

At Los Angeles Rams NFL games, parking cost $71 per game in 2025 for those who bought season passes in lots directly adjacent to SoFi Stadium.

Those stadium-adjacent lots, however, are unlikely to be open to fan parking at World Cup matches, and will likely be inside security perimeters. Some could be used for hospitality, sponsor activations or other operations. That will be the case at most, if not all, 2026 World Cup venues — there are 16 in total across the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

“The stadium footprint is going to look a lot different,” Lindsey Douglas, the chief operating officer of Kansas City's World Cup host committee, said last month.

Parking spaces, therefore, will be relatively scarce. At Kansas City Chiefs NFL games, by comparison, there are typically around 20,000 spaces surrounding Arrowhead Stadium and the neighboring baseball stadium. But for Kansas City's World Cup games, only 4,000 spaces will be “available for sale for ticket holders,” Douglas said.

FIFA is essentially capitalizing on that scarcity, not unlike NFL teams and other U.S. sports franchises do weekly, but to a different degree.

The Los Angeles parking passes are now the costliest, but prices in other cities also shocked fans when revealed in November. Passes have now been made available at seven of the 11 U.S. stadiums. The minimum price — for group-stage matches at Arrowhead in Kansas City, AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta — is $75. That's more than the cost of a Category 3 group-stage ticket at the last men's World Cup, held in Qatar in 2022.

In Miami, the minimum parking price was also $75 in November, but FIFA has since raised it to $100 — for group games involving Uruguay, Saudi Arabia and Cape Verde.

For Colombia vs. Portugal and Scotland vs. Brazil in Miami — and for some games in other cities, including all seven at Gillette Stadium near Boston — the parking passes are listed as “sold out,” but the FIFA spokesperson said: “As planning continues and details are finalized, additional inventory is expected to be made available. As a result, listings currently marked as ‘sold out' do not necessarily reflect final availability.”

Miami is one of several host cities where transportation to and from World Cup games could be a logistical nightmare. It was harrowing for some fans at Hard Rock Stadium and other venues during last summer's Club World Cup.

That, in part, is because many U.S. metropolitan areas lack the public transit infrastructure that sports fans in Europe and elsewhere typically use. Some stadiums are also inconveniently located. Americans, therefore, have grown accustomed to driving to games. Some buy passes in advance, but many drive to stadiums and pay at the entrance to lots on the day of a game.

At the World Cup, though, that won't be easy. A World Cup “customer guide” published by JustPark, FIFA's partner for the sale and management of parking, says that “all parking must be purchased in advance.” The FIFA spokesperson clarified that “in advance” means “no later than 24 hours before kickoff,” and “strongly encouraged” fans to “finalize their transportation plans in advance and, where available, consider mass transit options to help ensure a smooth arrival.”

Lots outside FIFA's purview — such as those run by local establishments or residents — could offer day-of parking, but they are generally far from stadiums, and could be expensive, per basic principles of supply and demand.

Even the passes that FIFA is selling will be for lots outside security perimeters, the FIFA spokesman confirmed.

In addition to public transit, which varies from city to city, local World Cup host committees will offer other services. Kansas City's, for example, will rent more than 200 buses and run shuttles from several locations around the region to Arrowhead Stadium on matchdays. They, too, will charge fans a fee for parking spots at these “park-and-ride” locations. (The fee will also cover shuttle service.) It's unclear if other cities — many of which are struggling to balance budgets while FIFA monopolizes the World Cup's revenue — will provide similar services, whether free or paid.

In Qatar, where the government was willing to spend billions of dollars to stage the 2022 World Cup, fans could ride Doha's metro and buses free.

In North America, hardly anything will be free. Longtime fans have told The Athletic that 2026 will be “by far” the most expensive World Cup ever, “in every sense.” And FIFA will profit. FIFA president Gianni Infantino said last week that the tournament will yield $11 billion.

Parking will be a relatively small piece of the large financial pie, but it will contribute to the overall cost of attendance.

In Philadelphia, group-stage parking costs $115. For knockout matches, prices rise, up to $200 or $225 at Atlanta's semifinal — for parking in lots near Centennial Olympic Park, roughly half a mile from the stadium.

FIFA has consistently justified its prices — for tickets and other things — by noting that it reinvests much of the money in soccer development globally.

In the ongoing debate over ticket prices, it has also pointed to the secondary market, where fans are reselling tickets at significantly higher prices than FIFA's.

That is the case for parking passes, too. On StubHub, as of last Thursday, the cheapest parking pass for Portugal vs. Colombia was $220. For Morocco vs. Brazil, it was $232 — even though FIFA isn't yet selling parking at that game's venue, MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (The “New York New Jersey” page on FIFA's JustPark site, along with pages for Houston, Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area, say that parking availability is “coming soon” or remains “to be determined.”)

It's unclear whether, or how, FIFA has attempted to restrict the resale of parking passes or prevent scalpers from buying passes.

The website includes a note: “IMPORTANT: Only match ticket holders are eligible to purchase parking passes, and you must use the same email address that was used to purchase your match tickets. Parking passes may be cancelled if the email address used to buy parking does not match your ticket purchase email. Only 1 parking pass per customer per match is permitted.”

But it's not clear when or how that restriction would be applied, especially in cases where scalpers also buy and resell tickets; cases where the ticket holder bought their ticket on a third-party site; or cases where a fan attends a match as the guest of a primary ticket buyer.

In response to this concern, the FIFA spokesperson wrote: “Parking passes may only be purchased using the email address associated with a ticket purchase made through www.fifa.com/tickets, including the FIFA Resale Platform. Each ticket holder may purchase one parking pass per match. On match day, fans will be required to present both their valid match ticket and parking pass to access parking areas.”

It's also unclear how many passes will be available at each stadium, and where many of these $75-plus parking spots will be. Los Angeles and Atlanta show specific locations, but other listings mark the stadium and say that the parking space is “0 miles” away. A JustPark customer support representative told The Athletic via email in November that the “0 miles” is “just a placeholder. Parking lots and spaces will be allocated closer to the event date.”

The FIFA spokesperson, beyond confirming that spots will be outside security perimeters, noted that plans were still “evolving,” and wrote: “Additional details, including parking maps and operational layouts, will be shared in due course.”

Ricardo Pepi will not be gracing the Premier League this season, with Fulham's proposed transfer for the United States men's national team forward now reported as called off.

Pepi was thought to be moving towards a €37 million ($43.7 million, £32 million) switch from PSV Eindhoven to the team from west London. But Fabrizio Romano has revealed that the Dutch club pulled the plug because they did not find an acceptable replacement.

It means that Pepi will now see out 2025–26 with PSV, for whom he has scored 11 goals in 22 matches played across all competitions so far this season.

After finding the net in five consecutive Eredivisie appearances from the end of November until early January, the 23-year-old Texan has been ruled out for the past three weeks with a broken arm. He would have joined Fulham injured, unable to play until some time in March.

If his recovery goes as expected, Pepi should be healthy and available by the time the USMNT is due to host challenging back-to-back World Cup warm-up friendlies at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in late March against Belgium and Portugal.

The FC Dallas youth alum will have two more months to build his match fitness as PSV seek to wrap up a third successive Dutch league title—they lead nearest competitor Feyenoord by 17 points with 13 games to play—and be fully ready for the 2026 World Cup in North America.

Another two warm-ups on May 31 and June 6 will come against Senegal and Germany respectively, before June 12's Group D opener against Paraguay.

Pepi could feasibly still become the next American to star in England's Premier League. His performances in what is destined to be a title-winning season for PSV prompted Fulham's interest this month and, as long as he returns to a similar level once his arm is healed, there is no reason why the Cottagers or alternative suitors wouldn't be back in for him come summer.

PSV are clearly willing to sell, as evidenced by agreeing on a transfer fee with Fulham—it's only a lack of time that caused the brakes to be pumped on this one now—and will probably hope to see Pepi light up the World Cup because of the inflationary effect it could have on his valuation.

There is a long list of Americans in Premier League history, but the number of currently active U.S. players in England's top flight is just four: Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace) and Antonee Robinson (Fulham).

History was made yesterday as Arsenal Women defeated Corinthians 3-2 to become the first-ever winners of the FIFA Women's Club World Cup. Following their triumph, the club unveiled the official FIFA Women's Club World Cup Champions Badge, which will adorn their kits for the next four seasons.

The new FIFA Women's Club World Cup Champions badge features a circular design completely covered in gold, symbolizing luxury and the ""royal"" status of the world champions.

The design is heavily inspired by the trophy itself. It features the tournament logo in the center, surrounded by a subtle geometric pattern that mimics the globe structure found on the silverware.

Surrounding the central graphic is the inscription: ""FIFA WOMEN'S CHAMPIONS CUP 2026 - CHAMPIONS"", confirming the official naming convention on the patch.

Unlike the men's annual tournament (prior to its recent expansion), the Women's Club World Cup is a quadrennial event. This means Arsenal Women will wear this golden badge for four full years, until the next tournament is held in 2030.

Fans won't have to wait long to see the badge in action. It is expected to make its debut on the Arsenal kits this coming Sunday in the huge Women's Super League clash against Manchester City.

Gold ticker tape rained down on Arsenal for the second time in eight months as captain Kim Little and vice-captain Leah Williamson lifted the inaugural FIFA Champions Cup gilded plate.

Following their Women's Champions League triumph in May — continuing their record as the only English club to conquer Europe — they made history yet again on Sunday by beating Brazilian side Corinthians 3-2 in extra time and pocketing $2.3million (£1.7m) in prize money.

Little described the victory as a “different feeling” when asked how this intercontinental title compares to the Champions League. “It's another trophy,” she told reporters after the win. “As players and a club, that is what we want to do.”

The Corinthians players were left disconsolate after losing a final with a real edge. “We wanted to give our fans their dream to be world champions,” head coach Lucas Piccinato said in her post-match press conference. “It was a magical moment for us. We will never forget playing the European champions in their own home.”

It is hard to assess what significance this new competition holds. Perhaps Arsenal season ticket holder Kevin Price put it best.

“It doesn't compare to the Champions League trophy,” he told The Athletic outside the Emirates before kick-off. “A four-team competition, albeit champions of their respective continents, but you play two games and win a trophy. That's not how most competitions work. Champions League — the best. This will be good for bragging rights. Best team in the world and all that.”

But the tournament was marred by last-minute organisational issues, a presenting partner with a conflict of interest and a winning side handed an overwhelming home advantage.

It was always going to be a challenge to attract fans to a midweek midday kick-off in Brentford, but FIFA had recruited hundreds of local school children in high-vis jackets to try to fill the 17,250-capacity Community Stadium for Wednesday's first semi-final between Corinthians and Gotham FC.

As it was, the shrieking children met their match as the Corinthian supporters were the stars of the show, out-singing and outlasting the neutral crowd. England manager Sarina Wiegman watched on alongside FIFA's chief football officer Jill Ellis.

Speaking to the media before the tournament, Ellis emphasised the importance of continuing to “elevate, grow and support the ecosystem” of women's club football. FIFA sees the Champions Cup as a stepping stone towards the delayed 2028 Club World Cup, designed to grow global competitiveness and investment.

This intercontinental tournament can incentivise confederations to invest in the women's game.

The winners' cheque is the highest payout awarded in women's club football, according to FIFA — although World Sevens Football (W7F), a new seven-a-side tournament introduced last year, awarded Bayern Munich $2.5m when they won in May. Arsenal's players will receive a winning bonus, but the $2.3m they won represents 10 per cent of the women's team's overall revenue in the 2024-25 season, and is nearly six times what the Champions League winners earn ($398,000).

Such numbers are praiseworthy but could also distort competitive balance in domestic leagues. That is even more important in women's football than in the men's game, and the growing gaps between teams could threaten the long-term sustainability of women's club football.

There had been a misguided assumption that the Champions Cup would culminate in a showdown between Arsenal and Gotham, the Women's Super League (WSL) against the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), but Corinthians captain Gabi Zanotti upset that party.

If there were any questions about what this tournament meant to her, she made it clear. “I have dedicated my whole life to reach this point,” she said, describing her decisive semi-final goal as “the most important” of her career.

The 40-year-old said the introduction of such competitions “took too long to happen”, and it was important to develop women's football globally.

Most players shared Arsenal's Olivia Smith's view that it was an “honour” and a “great opportunity” for their club to play in such a tournament. She welcomed the addition of more tournaments like the Champions Cup, and insisted that any chance to win a trophy is significant.

There have, however, been large wrinkles in the process.

First, the tournament was played in January. For Gotham and Corinthians, this is usually their off-season, whereas Arsenal and Moroccan side AS FAR are in the middle of their campaigns. There is no perfect solution that suits all parties, given different leagues play at different times of the year. But the 2027 and 2029 editions of the Champions Cup will also take place in January, as will the 2028 Club World Cup, although the hosts of all editions are yet to be decided.

Arsenal head coach Renee Slegers said the schedule “works for us” and they have a deep enough squad to compete on all fronts, whereas her Gotham counterpart, Juan Amoros, said it was “challenging”. The NWSL side brought their usual season preparation three to four weeks ahead of schedule, travelling from the United States to Spain on January 2. This time last year, they would have only been having their first-team meetings at this point.

“We hit the ground running right after New Year's in a way that is significantly earlier than any other NWSL team has ever started historically, including us last year,” Gotham general manager Yael Averbuch West told The Athletic before their 1-0 semi-final defeat. “This is not pre-season for us, this is an extension of the end of last season.”

Gotham took this competition seriously. They wanted to win another trophy and put their brand as well as the NWSL on the map. From that aspect, their defeat, in Amoros' words, was “a missed opportunity”. But he said the club does not look for excuses, rather solutions.

“The more you win in the world of football, the more games you play,” said Amoros. “That is the club we want to be, the one that plays all the games.”

The same scheduling issue applied to Corinthians. Zanotti described preparation for such a tournament as “very demanding”. Their last domestic game was in mid-December. “We've only had two weeks to get ready to come here,” she said. “It's not ideal.”

Spare a thought for the WSL, too, which would have been particularly frustrated that attention was being taken away from its heavyweight clash between Manchester City and Chelsea, a hugely influential game in the title race.

Other teething issues centred on organisation.

The introduction of the 2026 edition and its dates were only confirmed in March 2025. Since then, confirmations of venues, broadcasting and commercial partnerships have been very last-minute. A new competition needs a much longer runway to get it off the ground. Ellis acknowledged this.

Six weeks before the competition started, fans did not know where the games would be held. FIFA announced Brentford as host of the semi-finals and Arsenal for the third-place play-off and final as late as December 12. The attendance for the final was 25,031 fans, 7,210 for the third-placed match and 6,177 and 8,066 for the semi-finals.

The Price family's main motivation to go was their unwavering support for Arsenal, but Kevin criticised the tournament's marketing when asked why the crowd may not be as big as the game deserves. “I don't think it's been as well publicised,” he said. “It was sprung on everyone about six weeks ago. I don't think anybody realised how important it was.”

Upon the announcement that the tournament would take place, FIFA said the semi-finals and final would be held at a neutral venue. North America was considered but FIFA decided upon Europe, a decision Ellis acknowledges was made late.

“We know Arsenal is such a pillar in terms of driving the game,” she told members of the media. “Dropping it in a neutral site just doesn't make sense for where the women's game is.”

A FIFA statement said: “Key factors such as visibility, player experience, climate, accessibility for global fans and teams, media infrastructure, and commercial potential were thoroughly evaluated.”

But the selection of the Emirates for the final gave Arsenal a significant advantage, not only playing at home but also avoiding the logistical challenges from travelling.

“It is what it is,” said Piccinato, who wants future editions to be held at a neutral venue. The Corinthians head coach also said his club had complained to FIFA after two Arsenal youth players were pictured watching Corinthians train at their base, which they shared with Arsenal's academy. Slegers described the incident as “innocent” and “unfortunate”.

At one point, there were question marks over whether one of the semi-finals would take place. Morocco's FAR were due to arrive in London on Saturday but they were delayed until Monday evening because of “administrative issues”, according to their press officer.

“We didn't have the time to acclimatise and adapt, but we're doing the best we can,” manager Mohamed Amine Alioua said, even if goalkeeper Hind Hasnaoui added, in all sincerity, that their preparation was “perfect” for Wednesday's 6-0 semi-final defeat against Arsenal. Corinthians also had their own visa issues as Dayana Rodríguez, Gisela Robledo and Paola Garcia arrived on Tuesday, a week later than the rest of their team-mates.

A broadcast partner was not announced until two weeks before the final stage, when Sky and FIFA agreed to air the games in the UK and Ireland. CBS Sports in the U.S. picked up the final and third-placed game, announcing its coverage on Wednesday.

CazeTV, FIFA's broadcast partner in Brazil, received around one million concurrent views of the final on its live stream. By comparison, it had a similar number for Brazil's group-stage game against Panama in the 2023 World Cup.

VISA was announced as the global sponsor two days before the semi-finals while Kynisca, Michele Kang's multi-club ownership organisation, was controversially named the presenting partner of the inaugural competition less than a week before the start date. That led to suggestions of a conflict of interest, as Kang owns WSL side London City Lionesses, NWSL outfit Washington Spirit and eight-time Champions League winners OL Lyonnes.

Even if those teams did not compete in this year's edition, they could compete in future tournaments and at the 2028 Club World Cup. A financial link between an owner and a global tournament organised by the sport's governing body is deeply problematic, and any seed of doubt that there is a perception of bias — however small — has now been irreversibly planted.

It was an unusual arrangement given people cannot buy a product but instead, the partnership indirectly boosts Kang's own clubs' brands and at the final, earned her a seat at the high table alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino, FIFA's chief of global football development Arsene Wenger and Ellis.

FIFA said it is “delighted” with the partnership and is “comfortable”, adding the arrangement was only for the 2026 edition, with Kynisca-associated clubs involved. “Kynisca's support of this tournament reflects their wider commitment to transforming women's football through unprecedented investment, while also advancing elite women's club football,” it added via a statement.

Others will argue Kang has contributed more money to the women's game than any other individual, and that her investment and ambition are needed. If Kang's mission is to advance women's football, as she has repeatedly stated, funding an event that could trigger more investment seems logical.

Considering how late the partnership was announced, had Kang not stepped in, the tournament may have been left without a presenting partner altogether. But while Kang's intentions may be well-meaning, FIFA might have opened Pandora's box.

The sport's world governing body has invested significantly, paying for teams' business-class flights, transport, accommodation, food, beverages and on-the-ground support. Amoros praised the tournament's organisation as “fantastic”, adding that Gotham had everything they needed.

Proper investment in marketing the product is essential, however. FIFA ramped up paid marketing in the week leading up to the tournament and called upon former England international Jill Scott and Arsenal legend Ian Wright to encourage fans to buy tickets.

The tournament's tagline, “a new era of women's football”, did little to capture fans' attention, nor did it add any sense of jeopardy. Just because something is happening does not mean people will turn up. The UK women's football audience is not mature enough yet and FIFA leaned heavily on Arsenal's fanbase. But it would also be understandable if Arsenal were cautious in how they advertised the final — they are also trying to push a pivotal home game in their league campaign against Manchester City on Sunday.

“It stimulates growth when you create competitions,” added Ellis. “We've got to start somewhere. Let's be patient. We're committed to growing this every year.”

Arsenal played the hand they were dealt — and won — but FIFA must learn from its mistakes.

Final: Arsenal 3-2 Corinthians (aet)

Smith 15, Wubben-Moy 58, Foord 104; Zanotti 21, Albuquerque 90+6 pen

The most decorated women's club in England made more history in London on Sunday night, Arsenal securing a 3-2 win over the Copa Libertadores champions Corinthians in extra time to see them crowned winners of the inaugural Fifa Women's Champions Cup.

They were made to work for their victory, the Brazilians twice coming from behind to force another 30 minutes of football, but it was something of an inevitability. The Champions League winners benefited from being mid-season with players at full fitness – in contrast to Corinthians being in their pre-season and the Concacaf Champions Cup winners Gotham FC in their off-season – and from the decision to hold the tournament in London, and play the final at the Emirates Stadium. This was a competition set up for European success and Arsenal delivered. They are officially the world's best club and they have a nice trophy to prove it. The 13-point gap, albeit with a game in hand, between them and Women's Super League leaders Manchester City though, says otherwise.

The mood prior to kick-off was one of general bemusement at a competition Arsenal did not need in their schedule, sandwiched between critical WSL fixtures against Chelsea and City. “I think we all, and the players first, want to be competing at the highest level and they want to play games,” said the Arsenal manager, Renée Slegers, when asked about how they managed to fit these games into their season.

“That's what they train for, what they live for. What's important is that if the schedule goes further and further in adding games that we do it in a tempo that is fair to the players and the players' health. We are in a position where we have a really good squad with a lot of quality, but I'm also aware that not all teams have this luxury. So I think we have to be really aware of what we're doing, how we're growing competitions and adding competitions to the schedule, so we grow it in the right way.”

The club from São Paulo offered a far sterner test than semi-final opponents AS Far. The desire to take the title back to Brazil was evident in the talk of the fans, the manager, Lucas Piccinato, in the outrage at two unfortunate Arsenal academy players caught in a spying storm because they were spotted looking out the window at the Brazilian side as they trained at Barnet's stadium, where Arsenal's academy is based, and in the one million people watching on the stream of the Brazilian broadcaster CazéTV at the same time the men's team were playing Flamengo in the Supercopa.

“It was a big advantage playing in their home, but it is what it is,” said Piccinato. “We hope next time Arsenal will come to Brazil to play against us. I think it would be better if it was in a neutral venue.”

The home team were predictably dominant on their home turf, but it was the Corinthians faithful who dominated in the stands, outnumbered but not outsung. The opening goal arrived 15 minutes in, when Corinthians' goalkeeper Leticia parried Stina Blackstenius's effort into the path of Olivia Smith who swung home on the half volley.

Corinthians threatened on the counter but the equaliser came from a set piece, when Anneke Borbe failed to prevent a header from the 40-year-old Gabi Zanotti from crossing the line following Andressa's corner.

Gotham won the Women's Champions Cup third-place playoff by convincingly defeating AS Far 4-0 at Arsenal Stadium. The NWSL champions took the lead through Khyah Harper, before Savannah McCaskill's first-time finish and Jaedyn Shaw's penalty put the game out of reach by half-time. A Midge Purce tap-in after the break finished off the Moroccan side.



Gotham's coach, Juan Carlos Amorós, still had his thoughts on his side's 1-0 semi-final defeat by Corinthians in the aftermath. “It's a similar game in a lot of ways to the one we played four days ago,” he said. “The main difference is we were able to get the early lead that we know unsettled teams, and we were able to be more clinical in front of goal, which really allowed us to then play a bit more of a game where players can enjoy.” Guardian sport

Arsenal's second came from a less familiar source, the centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy pulling away from her marker to head in from Emily Fox's cross from the right.

Seemingly home, though not dry, they were punished again by the never-say-die Brazilian side. Katie McCabe was adjudged to have fouled Gisela Robledo deep into added time despite appearing to have got the ball before the player and, after a video assistant review, Vic Albuquerque converted from the spot to force extra time.

The celebrations were wild, but short-lived; the Gunners were patient and punctured the momentum of the visiting team on the counter when Frida Maanum dispossessed Duda Sampaio and found her fellow substitute Caitlin Foord, who fired in.

There was a nasty accident at the close when Borbe collided with Wubben-Moy and a Corinthians player as she smothered the ball beneath their feet. The goalkeeper left on a stretcher and was taken to hospital as a precaution.

It was relief for Arsenal when the final whistle blew, Foord's strike saving them from embarrassment in a tournament where they had a significant advantage. If this competition is to gain credibility and momentum, it needs a substantial amount of work back at the drawing board.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Sport in the United States is dominated by a handful of major leagues that shape culture, media coverage and commercial investment. American football, basketball and baseball have long defined the sporting landscape, while ice hockey maintains a strong presence. However, football, or soccer as it's known in the US, is quietly climbing the rankings, with the FIFA World Cup heading to America later this year.

American Football

American football sits comfortably at the top of the US sporting hierarchy. The National Football League dominates television ratings, sponsorship, sports betting and cultural relevance. The Super Bowl is more than a sporting event; it's a national occasion blending sport and entertainment on an unparalleled scale. Friday night high school games and Saturday college football further embed the sport and the NFL into American life.

Basketball

Basketball is the most internationally recognised American sport, largely thanks to the National Basketball Association. The NBA's star-driven appeal, fast-paced action and global reach have made it a favourite among younger audiences. Icons such as LeBron James and Stephen Curry transcend sport, while the league's strong presence on social media has helped basketball remain culturally relevant in an increasingly digital era.

Baseball

Often referred to as America's pastime, baseball retains a deep emotional and historical connection with fans. Major League Baseball continues to draw large crowds during its long season, and its slower pace appeals to purists who value tradition and statistics. While it may not command the same year-round attention as the NFL or NBA, baseball's roots in American identity remain firmly intact.

Ice Hockey And Other Major Sports

Ice hockey, led by the National Hockey League, enjoys passionate followings in colder regions and traditional markets such as Canada and the northern United States. Meanwhile, motorsports, golf and college athletics also command significant attention, particularly during major events. However, these sports tend to exist in specific niches rather than dominating the national conversation.

Where Football Ranks In America

Football currently sits outside the traditional “big three,” but its trajectory is unmistakably upward. Major League Soccer has expanded rapidly, youth participation continues to grow, and European leagues attract millions of American viewers each weekend. High-profile players choosing the US as a destination have further boosted visibility, while internationally tournaments now attract mainstream media coverage.

The FIFA World Cup Effect

The upcoming FIFA World Cup represents a pivotal moment for football in America. Hosting matches on home soil brings unprecedented exposure, new fans and increased commercial interest. Broadcasters, sponsors and advertisers are all positioning themselves to capitalise, and there's already been an increase in sports betting ahead of the tournament. More importantly, the World Cup offers football a rare chance to embed itself permanently into the American sporting mainstream.

Conclusion

America's sporting landscape remains dominated by established giants, but football's rise is no longer speculative; it is happening in real time. As the FIFA World Cup approaches, the gap between football and the traditional US sports continues to narrow. While it may not overtake American football anytime soon, the tournament could make the moment football firmly claims its place among America's elite sporting passions.

Looking beyond the tournament itself, the long-term legacy could be transformational, influencing grassroots participation, media investment and commercial partnerships. For American audiences, the World Cup may ultimately redefine football's standing and accelerate its evolution into a mainstream sport.

February 2 – FIFA, The FA and the Women's Super League Football (WSL Football) have announced two programmes to increase the number of women's coaches in the game as the cornerstone of the Women's Champions Cup 2026 legacy programme.

The aim is to remove barriers, accelerate professional development and create sustainable pathways for female coaches. FIFA is fund a targeted scholarship programme providing financial support for female coaches in England who are pursuing the UEFA A Diploma and the UEFA Pro Diploma.

A second initiative will deliver an evidence-based, individualised development programme for female coaches already working in a coaching role. The objective is to accelerate learning and progression within England's elite women's football environment.

“Competitions like this one help us to strengthen the pathways in women's football and to elevate the entire ecosystem. The future of the game really depends on what we build beyond the pitch,” said FIFA's Chief Football Officer, Jill Ellis.

“There are simply not enough women in coaching, not because of a lack of talent or ambition, but largely due to limited access and opportunity, and a lack of clear pathways. Closing this gap is essential not only to equity, but also to unlocking the full potential of our sport. This landmark legacy coaching initiative is one of the most direct ways we can have a positive impact,” Ellis continued.

The push is to unlock access to senior roles and further high-performance development opportunities for women.

“We have already seen many incredible female coaches progress through UEFA's A and Pro Diploma courses, and this scholarship provides opportunities for more women to follow this path and access elite coaching education that will help advance their coaching careers,” said the Head of Coach Development at The FA, Dan Clements.

“… it is imperative that we continue to nurture the existing pool of talented female coaches. That is why we are excited to collaborate and deliver this development programme, which will ensure that the knowledge and skill sets of female coaches develop as the women's game continues to grow.”

February 2 – Arsenal won the inaugural FIFA Women's Champions Cup on Sunday evening picking up the largest prize payout in the history of women's football. An English team also won the first edition of the expanded men's Club World Cup last summer, when Chelsea picked up $100 million.

Renée Slegers' side defeated South American champions Corinthians 3–2 after extra time at the Emirates Stadium, landing a £1.7 million winners' cheque as FIFA's new six-team tournament made its debut in the international calendar. 

Designed to bring together the continental champions from around the world, the competition represents FIFA's most ambitious step yet in globalising elite women's club football – despite Arsenal coincidentally playing at their home ground for the final in front of a smaller-than-expected crowd of 25,031 at the 60,700-capacity Emirates Stadium.

The Champions League holders made a fast start at their home ground in north London, with record signing Olivia Smith opening the scoring after 15 minutes. Corinthians responded quickly through captain Gabi Zanotti, who equalised six minutes later, leaving the match finely balanced at the break.

Arsenal regained control in the second half when England defender Lotte Wubben-Moy headed home to restore the lead, and the hosts appeared to be in cruise control until a 96th-minute penalty allowed the Brazilian side to force extra time, threatening to spoil Arsenal's night.

Instead, it was substitute Caitlin Foord who delivered the defining moment, beating goalkeeper Lele at her near post in the 104th minute to decide the final and confirm Arsenal as the first winners of the Women's Champions Cup.

The closing stages were not without concern for the hosts, with goalkeeper Anneke Borbe stretchered off following a collision with teammate Wubben-Moy, slightly tempering the celebrations at full time.
Captain Kim Little praised her side's composure under pressure. “It's great to get the win,” she said. “We showed incredible character and resilience to lose the goal right at the end and come back in extra time. The girls did great.

“It's obviously a unique experience, it being the first Champions Cup. We'll take a lot from winning today and getting a trophy.”

With FIFA positioning the Women's Champions Cup and the expansion to a Women's Club World Cup as a cornerstone of the women's calendar, Arsenal's victory sets an early benchmark – on the pitch and commercially – for a new phase of the women's club game.

With less than six months until kickoff, Guardian readers share their experiences of buying World Cup tickets – or deciding not to 

The 2026 World Cup in the US, Mexico and Canada is less than six months away. Fifa's ticketing process has been met with demand and controversy. Security concerns for fans traveling to the US have risen.

We asked readers to share their experiences of buying World Cup tickets – or deciding not to. These are some of the stories we received.

When President Trump placed aggressive tariffs on Canadian exports, I completely swore off travel to the United States. So, when Fifa selected me during the “Domestic Exclusivity” phase, I leapt at the opportunity to buy tickets to a match in Canada. Each step of the online process was somewhat confusing, including a counter-clockwise circular countdown with imperceptibly slow movement and multiple login requests. Nevertheless, after a 90-minute wait, I was able to purchase tickets for my family to Canada's last group game. They cost $270 (Canadian) each. The price was high, but that's just the reality for North American sports today. There are tickets at that price and above for every NFL or NHL game. The price of the hotel I booked outside Vancouver was far more shocking. John, Winnipeg, Canada

I went to the World Cup in Germany in 2006 when I lived in the UK, and always wanted to go to another in my lifetime. I now live in Australia, and being conscious of the fact that I'd be receiving a decent tax rebate from the Aussie government, had decided to spend that on flying me and the missus to the World Cup taking in some games in the US and Mexico and was registered for tickets and a rough itinerary planned. However that decision all changed as I watched the clown show, clusterfuck of the Trump/Infantino White House press conferences, alongside the news of the appalling treatment of immigrants and tourists in the US. I've basically decided that not a cent of my money will go to making the tournament a success for either of those odious pricks. Instead I'll spend the money on taking in the Ashes, the Rugby World Cup and a few decent gigs/music festivals in the Australia, helping the local economy here. Adam, 53, Brisbane, Australia

I spent $14,400 on tickets to nine games (a total of 32 tickets). Six group games, two round of 32 and one round of 16.

I am expecting that the majority of my tickets will be taken by friends and family traveling from the UK – I only intend to attend two to three games personally. Do I think it'll be worth it? No. I think it is crazy to spend $500 per ticket for a football game, especially given so many of the group games will be between countries that would not have qualified for a 32-team World Cup. However, with games “local” to me, it still feels more accessible than 2030 or 2034. I attended the World Cup in 2010 and spent £800 on tickets in total, including the quarter-final, semi-final and final. I went to Brazil 2014 (but was only able to get tickets for one game) and Russia 2018, but skipped 2022. Prices for 2026 are out of control but the risk of waiting in the hope ticket prices crash (as they did for the Club World Cup) closer to the time was not a risk I was willing to take. Tom F, Long Island

I bought four tickets for a group game in Philadelphia. I got selected in the Fifa lottery and the process itself to buy the tickets was pretty straightforward. I wanted tickets for a New York game as it's closer to me but the Category 3 & 4 tickets were not available and the Category 2 tickets were too expensive. I ended up paying $155 each for four tickets. It's a big outlay but unfortunately any event in the States is just going to be expensive.

I have had a bit of buyer's remorse at times about getting the tickets but it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see a World Cup game. Despite all the ridiculousness around it, once the games start it is still the most pure form of the sport around.

Obviously the situation with ICE is worrying. I work in construction so I've met a lot of Colombian & Ecuadorean people who would love to go to these games but, can they be sure they will be not be hassled going to game even if they are in the USA legitimately? Will fans from those countries want to travel even though they are some of the teams who have bought the most color to recent World Cups? Even neutral Latin & Central Americans would probably love to see it but will they want to deal with the hassle of going to a game? And that's before you get to the question of cost. John, Irishman living in New York

I have bought 62 tickets. Spent approximately $70,000. I do think it will be worth it as they can be resold. It's also, in my opinion, the best sporting event and only comes around twice a decade. Yes, there were obstacles, but all challenges in life are opportunities. Sameer Somal, entrepreneur, New York

Miami is absolutely not ready for a World Cup. The city has no real public transportation, the roads are a mess on a normal day, and the infrastructure is nowhere near capable of handling an event of this scale.

And honestly, I'm not buying tickets. Fifa is a corrupt organization that has never cared about fans or human rights – only profit. The last World Cup proved that.

To make things even worse, the atmosphere in the US under the Trump administration is frightening. Brown people – including myself – live with the fear of being targeted simply because of our skin. It's hard to celebrate a global event when basic safety and dignity are on the line. Antonio Gomez Berumen, Miami

Living in Toronto, it's been a life's dream for me to attend a World Cup match and I was very excited with the prospect of a World Cup happening in the US, Canada and Mexico. Two things have tempered my optimism: first, Donald Trump and the current state of the United States. It is quite evident that the current dispensation does not want outsiders in the country – more so, outsiders who look like me (brown and Indian). At this current stage, I don't think I will take the risk of going to the US to watch a match. That leaves very few matches to be held in Toronto. I have signed up for all the Fifa draws so far, waiting in queue for hours only to be told that I have been ‘entered' in a draw. Till now, I have not heard any positive news. I would love to watch a football World Cup match – any match, honestly – and I understand that it may not be cheap which is why I've started trying from so early. But I am getting frustrated and I don't think I will be able to get tickets after all – I don't think I can afford the astronomical prices that I see floating around. Angikaar Choudhury, 35, Toronto

I bought my World Cup 2026 tickets during the Early Visa Draw. In total I've spent over $7,000 so far. The process was stressful – at one point I waited almost 40 minutes just to get into the system, and by the time I got in, many of the major matches like the semi-finals and the final were already gone. The prices in general were quite high, but I still wanted to secure the games I cared about. Even with all the difficulties, I'm really excited. I'll be in the US for my summer holiday, and I can't wait to attend the matches in New York and Miami. For me, this feels like a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Cansu, Türkiye

I won't be buying tickets. Even though travel would be very easy for me as an American citizen, and both of my sisters live in host cities (NYC and Dallas), so lodging wouldn't be an issue. And yet, I'm just so disgusted with the Trump administration and the way “Johnny” was cozied up to him, and with the extortionate ticket prices, and the looming threat of ICE – it's just impossible to support. And it's really upsetting, because I have a five-year-old son and this should be a core memory for him. But in the end I think I'll save up the money and use it to take him to a game at the Emirates instead. Although, I wouldn't completely rule out one of the Mexican venues next summer … Alex, Montana

This has been beyond stressful. Between family and friends we've had about 10 accounts across the UK and USA trying in the presale draws and got nothing.

We did manage to get extremely lucky that our credit card company (Wells Fargo) had a draw so we had about 15-20 devices trying to login and my husband got us four tickets for the round of 16 in Houston for $2,000. Our kids will be six and 10 and we can only hope we get really lucky and England will be playing. We're still trying to get tickets for the Kansas City quarter-final as it's the closest game to where we live (a 10-hour drive).

Major major obstacles, London 2012 was so much simpler! Claire, Colorado

I naively thought getting at least one pair of World Cup tickets would be as manageable as getting tickets for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. Surely, I thought, If I could manage to figure out the IOC's ticketing system and attended a ton of Olympic events with face value tickets, then surely purchasing one pair of tickets to a local World Cup would be somewhat achievable. I was wrong. I was very wrong.

I applied for every single ticketing opportunity and failed each time. It's been easier to find the Aurora Borealis in our neighborhood than it is to find someone who managed to win the World Cup lottery – not one of my friends/family/co-workers/neighbors/community members managed to snag tickets.

I admit the frustration of being unable to attend a local World Cup game has dampened my enthusiasm for the event a bit. I still haven't given up hope and have joined every available promotional contest and event to try to get a pair of those tickets. And I have also been keeping an eye on the secondary market in case some fair priced tickets magically pop up. But I've also come to accept that if it doesn't happen, then it doesn't. I'll be perfectly happy to enjoy the World Cup in the comfort of my home, at my local sports bar, or at a neighborhood watch party – the places where all the real local fans will be this World Cup. Rex, Richmond, Canada

My family and I bought tickets. We spent $800 for four tickets, and plan to buy two more (for which we have budgeted another $800).

The ticket lotteries had us stressed that all the tickets would be gone by the time the general sale started. So when my mother-in-law was drawn for one of the pre-sale right-to-buy contests, we bought tickets right away. Since my mother-in-law, who is older, was the one who won the drawing, we needed to coach her over FaceTime on how to buy the tickets. She was quickly getting overwhelmed, especially because the ticket prices seemed to be changing but the second (as other more tech savvy winners bought up the cheap seats). We needed tickets on [26 June], since that was the date we were all able to get off work and school. The game ended up being Egypt-Iran. It is exciting to get to see Mo Salah play in person, but I would be lying if I wasn't a bit disappointed to not get France or Brazil, or another “bigger” footballing country.

With all of that said, we still think it will be worth it – seeing high-level football like the World Cup is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for football fans in a non-footballing country like the US. I completely understand why my fellow American soccer fans are willing to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to see games. Paul, Illinois

After surviving a health scare, it has been a dream of mine to go to a World Cup final. For Qatar 2022 I wasn't well enough and I wasn't too keen on the chosen location for the World Cup. I'd pencilled in 2026's final in New York as my plan. I was organised, I booked accommodation two years in advance to be in New York over the final.

Everything was in place, we just needed tickets. We knew these would be expensive and have managed to save about $1,000AUD each for final tickets. We'd probably even go to $1,200AUD each if we had to and we based these estimations on the last final in Qatar with the cheapest final tickets there being $900AUD. Then [in December], the prices came out. Cheapest ticket for the final is roughly $6,250AUD each. Or $13,000AUD for the both of us. We don't have that kind of money.

What was a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, a dream after years of illness and not being able to work has been squashed by Fifa's insistence of making as much money as possible, of Infantino's disregard for the real football fan that puts their entire life savings at risk. It's disgusting. We will go to New York. We will have a great time in a great city. We've booked the flights and accommodation. But we won't be going to the final I've dreamt of purely because Fifa and Infantino need to make more money on top of all the money they already have. We are devastated. Jon Hewitt, 42, Australia

I have purchased some tickets, but not as many as I'd like. I'm frustrated about how Fifa is handling their ticket offerings for those who use a wheelchair.

[Regarding hospitality seats] I asked On Location whether I could buy a wheelchair seat [space], and they said I had to buy a regular seat, then call them and let them know I wanted a wheelchair space, and they would try to accommodate. But their email specifically said, “please note, while we will do our best to accommodate your request, this is not a guarantee.” So I have to spend $2,000-$5,000 on a ticket, and they can't even guarantee that I can use it. (I am unlikely to buy Hospitality seats because of the cost, but I'm still disappointed that the option doesn't exist for those with accessibility needs.) I asked Fifa Collect if I could exercise a RTB to get a wheelchair seat. Their response was “Unfortunately we do not handle this. After you buy your ticket you should address to Fifa Ticketing direct in order for them to assist you.” So once again, I'd have to spend a lot of money up front, with no guarantee that I'll get a usable seat. I actually had a RTB but ended up selling it because it was useless to me.

I have had two shots at buying tickets, the Visa pre-sale and the Early Access Draw. In both cases companion seats (a regular seat next to the wheelchair space) were all gone early. By the time my purchasing time slot came up, there were still wheelchair spaces available for many of the games, but no companion seats. I think that's because Fifa lets you buy up to three companion seats for each wheelchair seat. So the companion seats were sold out much more quickly than the wheelchair seats. By letting early buyers get three companion seats, those seats run out by the time later buyers get online, forcing wheelchair users to attend games on their own.

[As of 22 January] I have continued to ping Fifa about how to get a companion seat next to a wheelchair seat. They finally responded that I should just purchase two wheelchair seats: one for the wheelchair user, and one for the companion. I have no idea if this strategy will work, but that's what I've done for the upcoming Random Selection Draw. We'll see.

International Football

WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 05: Gianni Infantino, President of FIFA, speaks during the FIFA World Cup 2026 Official Draw at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on December 05, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jia Haocheng - Pool/Getty Images) Pool

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has spoken out against banning Russia and Israel from international football — and also defended awarding U.S. President Donald Trump the FIFA Peace Prize in December.

Both FIFA, the world governing body, and its European counterpart UEFA banned the Russian national team from competing in 2022 after the country invaded Ukraine. There have been calls for FIFA and UEFA to impose a similar ban on Israel because of the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the country's support of settlements in Palestinian territories.

Although Russia's ban is yet to be lifted, Infantino claimed it “has not achieved anything” and revealed he will be looking at removing the ban, as well as potentially changing FIFA's statutes to prevent similar sanctions in the future.

Infantino was speaking in an hour-long, in-person interview with Yalda Hakim, host of The World on Sky News, which was released online on Monday afternoon.

“We have to,” Infantino responded when asked whether he is going to explore lifting the ban. “Definitely. Because this ban has not achieved anything, it has just created more frustration and hatred.”

On the possibility of changing FIFA's statutes to stop national teams being banned, Infantino said they “should actually never ban any country from playing football because of the acts of their political leaders”.

In 2023, FIFA and UEFA lifted bans on Russia Under-17 teams from participating in international tournaments across the men's and women's game, provided they competed as the “Football Union of Russia”, and in the absence of their national flag, their national anthem, their national-team kit and equipment, and played in neutral colours.

In October, Amnesty International, the global human rights organisation, wrote an open letter to FIFA and UEFA to “suspend the Israeli Football Association until clubs from settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are removed from its leagues”.

The letter also argued that “football cannot be separated from Israel's unlawful occupation”, although Infantino told Sky News that implementing a ban on Israel “is a defeat”.

In a wide-ranging interview, the FIFA president defended handing Trump the FIFA Peace Prize ahead of the men's World Cup draw in Washington at the beginning of December.

“Whatever we can do to help peace in the world, we should be doing it, and for this reason, for some time we were thinking about (whether) we should do something to reward people who do something,” Infantino said of the award, before insisting that “objectively, he (Trump) deserves it”.

“It's not just Gianni Infantino who said it… (there's) a Nobel Peace Prize winner (Maria Corina Machado) who said this. He was instrumental in resolving conflicts and saving thousands of lives.”

Corina Machado, the leader of the opposition in Venezuela, presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Trump during a meeting at the White House on Jan. 15, saying it was “a recognition for his unique commitment (to) our freedom”.

Corina Machado's visit to Washington came weeks after Trump ordered U.S. forces to seize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro his wife, Cilia Flores, in a military operation in Caracas. Maduro and Flores were brought to the U.S. and have been charged in a drug-trafficking case.

Infantino was also pressed on the calls for countries to boycott this year's World Cup due to concerns relating to Trump's rhetoric around invading Greenland and his domestic immigration policies.

The FIFA president dismissed that narrative and said nobody has suggested cutting diplomatic ties with the United States, essentially asking why football should be treated differently.

“I think, in our divided world, in our aggressive world, we need occasions where people can come, can meet around the passion (for football).”

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' office is calling the next three years “the most intensive and exciting three-year period of major sporting events that any city in the world has ever experienced” as the city prepares for a full slate of global competitions. Bass is set to deliver a State of the City address Monday to outline her administration's priorities for the year ahead — and beyond.

“The State of the City will reflect on this moment and serve as a unifying celebration of Los Angeles, the city that we love and it's people, neighborhoods and cultures,” the mayor's office said.

The first major sporting event to touch down in the City of Angels is this summer's FIFA World Cup. SoFi Stadium is set to host several matches, including two U.S. Men's National Team group stage outings, two Round of 32 matchups and a quarterfinal showdown.

The World Cup final is set for July 19 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, just outside New York City.

In 2027, Super Bowl LXI will be hosted at SoFi. It will be the second time the Big Game has been held there — Super Bowl LVI, between the Rams and Bengals, took place at SoFi in 2022 — and it will be the ninth Super Bowl to be hosted in the Greater Los Angeles area. 2027 also marks the first year the Super Bowl will be broadcast on ESPN.

 California union believes Waymos should be off the streets 

The biggest sporting event in the world comes to L.A. in 2028: the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The games will attract visitors from around the world and make use of the Greater L.A. area's many stadiums and facilities. Mayor Bass has promised a “car-free Olympics,” although some Angelenos are skeptical of how attainable that goal is.

Bass is set to give her State of the City address on Wednesday afternoon at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Another speech is planned for mid-April; this address, according to the L.A. Times, will be more of a traditional State of the City address and focus heavily on the mayor's budget and spending priorities.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Ex-FIFA chief backs US World Cup boycott","https://www.jpost.com/international/article-885278","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 03:52:19 GMT","

Joseph Sepp Blatter, former FIFA president, backed a proposed boycott of World Cup matches in the United States last week, citing the actions of President Donald Trump and his administration for the boycott.

The United States is set to co-host the World Cup with Canada and Mexico beginning in June of this year.

Blatter, who served as FIFA president from 1998 to 2015, voiced his support for the boycott in a post on X/twitter on January 26, referring to comments made by Mark Pieth during an interview with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund last week. 

Pieth, a Swiss attorney specializing in white-collar crime and anti-corruption, previously chaired the Independent Governance Committee that oversaw FIFA's reform efforts.

In his interview with Der Bund, Pieth stated, “If we consider everything we've discussed, there's only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from the USA! You'll see it better on TV anyway. Upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don't please the officials, they'll be put straight on the next flight home. If they're lucky.” 

Blatter is not the only international soccer figure questioning the suitability of the United States as a host country.

Oke Göttlich, a vice president of the German soccer federation, mentioned in an interview with the Hamburger Morgenpost that it is time to seriously consider a boycott of this year's World Cup.

The Associated Press reported that concerns from the international soccer community about the United States primarily stem from Trump's expansionist stance on Greenland, as well as travel bans and aggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protesters in American cities, particularly Minneapolis. 

Travel plans for fans from two major soccer countries in Africa were disrupted when the Trump administration announced a ban that effectively barred people from Senegal and Ivory Coast from following their teams unless they already possessed visas.

Trump reportedly cited “screening and vetting deficiencies” as the primary reason for these suspensions.

Additionally, fans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries that have qualified for the World Cup, will also be barred from entering the United States, as they were included in the initial travel ban announced by the Trump administration.

History was made yesterday as Arsenal Women defeated Corinthians 3-2 to become the first-ever winners of the FIFA Women's Club World Cup. Following their triumph, the club unveiled the official FIFA Women's Club World Cup Champions Badge, which will adorn their kits for the next four seasons.

The new FIFA Women's Club World Cup Champions badge features a circular design completely covered in gold, symbolizing luxury and the ""royal"" status of the world champions.

The design is heavily inspired by the trophy itself. It features the tournament logo in the center, surrounded by a subtle geometric pattern that mimics the globe structure found on the silverware.

Surrounding the central graphic is the inscription: ""FIFA WOMEN'S CHAMPIONS CUP 2026 - CHAMPIONS"", confirming the official naming convention on the patch.

Unlike the men's annual tournament (prior to its recent expansion), the Women's Club World Cup is a quadrennial event. This means Arsenal Women will wear this golden badge for four full years, until the next tournament is held in 2030.

Fans won't have to wait long to see the badge in action. It is expected to make its debut on the Arsenal kits this coming Sunday in the huge Women's Super League clash against Manchester City.

Manchester United reportedly failed in a late bid to hijack Liverpool's proposed deal for highly-rated Rennes defender Jeremy Jacquet. The France Under-21 international is seemingly heading to Anfield, with other Premier League suitors being left empty-handed. United form part of that pack, with the Red Devils eager to buy into the obvious potential that Jacquet possesses.

The classy 20-year-old centre-half has emerged as one of the most sought-after young talents in European football. Impressive progress has been made since making a senior breakthrough at Rennes.

Scouting missions aplenty have been taken in, with Jacquet catching the eye, and positive reports have been sent back to bases across the continent. Sky Sports Deutschland claim that United are among those to have expressed interest.

They went as far as making a play for Jacquet's signature once it emerged that he could be heading to England. That approach was unsuccessful, however, as Liverpool have already put an agreement in place.

The Reds have a £60 million ($82m) package pieced together, with Arne Slot looking to build long-term on Merseyside. According to The Athletic, a medical at Anfield is set to be undertaken on deadline day.

Jacquet will sign a contract with Liverpool through to 2031, with his big-money transfer being completed in the summer. He will jet into Merseyside to put the finishing touches to that agreement, before heading back to Rennes.

Chelsea were another team that were hoping to get a deal done there, but they have missed out on the hottest of prospects. Jacquet, who has started every Ligue 1 fixture that he has been available for this season, has favoured the Reds over the Blues. That is because he feels that regular game time will be easier to come by at Liverpool - with Ibrahima Konate's contract running down towards free agency and Virgil van Dijk set to turn 35 in July.

Chelsea, in contrast, already have Trevoh Chalobah, Wesley Fofana, Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Axel Disasi, Aaron Anselmino and Jorrel Hato on their books, while Levi Colwill is recovering from injury and Mamadou Sarr is returning from a loan spell at Strasbourg.

Liverpool have been able to secure the centre-half reinforcements that they have been after for some time. They had been hoping to land Marc Guehi in the summer of 2025, before seeing him head towards free agency at Crystal Palace.

Manchester City swooped in and paid a fee for the England international during the winter window. That forced Slot and Co to turn their attention elsewhere, with Jacquet considered to be a shrewd addition for the short and long-term future.

French football expert Julien Laurens has told Sky Sports of Jacquet, with the talented defender being likened to fellow countrymen who are already starring in the Premier League for Arsenal and Chelsea: “He's the real deal. I know he's only 20, he hasn't played for France and he hasn't played in the Champions League or Europa League.

“He has a long way to go but he's been impressive last season, after they [Rennes] called him back from his loan in the second division, and this season, with Habib Beye.

“You can't get it wrong. He is going to be amazing. He reminds me of when William Saliba burst onto the scene in France with Saint-Etienne, or Wesley Fofana.

“It's about how much you value that potential and talent. You would pay a lot of money for someone who hasn't really proved much. It's a lot of money for such a young player.”

Liverpool will be hoping to prove to Jacquet that he has made the right decision over the remainder of the 2025-26 campaign. They are currently sat below United and Chelsea in the Premier League table, with a difficult title defence being taken in, but remain in the hunt for Champions League qualification while also chasing down major honours at home and abroad.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cristiano Ronaldo's influence in the Saudi Pro League is reportedly impacting three high-profile deals that were being lined up late in the winter transfer window. Portuguese GOAT CR7 is frustrated at how things are playing out at Al-Nassr and is looking to flex his muscles when it comes to business being done by domestic rivals in the Middle East.

Big money continues to be invested by ambitious outfits in Saudi Arabia, with Ronaldo helping to start that trend when he made his way to Al-Nassr in 2023. After seeing his contract torn up at Premier League giants Manchester United, the Portuguese signed the most lucrative terms in world football when heading to Riyadh.

He has since agreed an extension to that deal through to the summer of 2027. The evergreen frontman will be 42 by that time that contract comes to a close. He is being tipped by many to play on beyond that point.

It could be that the five-time Ballon d'Or decides to take on a new challenge before hanging up his boots, with the Portugal international cutting a frustrated figure at present. It is being claimed that CR7 could go on strike and refuse to play for Al-Nassr in upcoming fixtures.

He may be absent from a derby date with Al-Riyadh on Monday. There had been reports to suggest that Ronaldo would be rotated out of that contest in order to keep him fresh. Al-Nassr are understandably eager to avoid pushing their talismanic captain to breaking point.

Portuguese news outlet A Bola have, however, claimed that Ronaldo is “unhappy with the way the PIF (Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia) is managing the club he has represented for three years, especially compared to the treatment given to rival clubs, also managed by the same fund”.

The all-time great wants more money to be injected into his project and will not stand by idly as others are allowed to carry out impressive business. That has meant stepping in to prevent deals being reached by Saudi Pro League opponents.

Ronaldo's former Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema has become embroiled in a contract dispute at Al-Ittihad, leading to exit talk being sparked there. It was suggested that table-topping Al-Hilal were eager to add the prolific French striker to their ranks.

Any agreement there is being blocked by Ronaldo “on the grounds that it would damage the fair competition environment”. That is despite the Portuguese icon seeing the likes of Sadio Mane, Joao Felix and Kingsley Coman join him at Al-Nassr.

Ronaldo's intervention is having a domino effect across the Saudi Pro League, with a couple of other big-name performers unable to complete transfers that are in the pipeline and ready to be signed off.

Sports Digitale report that: “Cristiano Ronaldo's intervention in Karim Benzema's Al-Hilal transfer has caused N'Golo Kante to be unable to sign with Fenerbahce yet, while Youssef En-Nesyri has been unable to join Al-Ittihad. The clubs have finalised the agreements and submitted them to the Saudi Pro League; official signatures are on hold pending approval.”

Willingness to bow to Ronaldo's demands highlights how desperate those in the Saudi Pro League are to keep him settled in his current surroundings. If he were to be pushed too far, then it could be that he seeks a move elsewhere and takes his considerable global following with him.

Compromises will now be sought that help to make everybody happy. Benzema may still be on the move, and that could allow Kante and En-Nesyri to complete the transfers that they are already committed to.

Ronaldo is desperate to give himself the best possible chance of chasing down major honours in 2026, having found tangible success hard to come by across his spell with Al-Nassr. He is also chasing down 1,000 competitive career goals and is expected to lead Portugal into this summer's World Cup as captain of his country - with more history being made there.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Tyrell Malacia's nightmare spell at Manchester United has taken a chaotic and bitter turn after the club blocked his proposed exit to Turkey while he was literally waiting to board his flight. The Dutch defender has been left ""furious"" and in a state of total disbelief by the 11th-hour U-turn from technical director Jason Wilcox, which traps him at Old Trafford despite him having no apparent prospect of first-team football.

According to a bombshell report from Dutch outlet Voetbal International, the 26-year-old left-back was at the airport, luggage in hand and preparing to fly to Istanbul to finalise a loan move, when his phone rang.

On the other end of the line was United technical director Jason Wilcox. In a move that has stunned the player's camp, Wilcox reportedly informed Malacia that the transfer was off and ordered him not to board the plane.

The intervention came at the absolute final moment. Malacia had been given the green light to travel and complete his medical with the Turkish club, understood to be a temporary switch to restart his career, only for the Old Trafford hierarchy to change their minds abruptly. The defender was forced to turn around and head back to Manchester, leaving his transfer hopes in tatters.

The reaction from the player's side has been one of incandescent rage. VI describes the mood as one of ""disbelief"" and ""anger."" Malacia had spent the days leading up to the deadline negotiating his exit, believing he had the full blessing of the club to leave in search of regular minutes.

To be pulled back from the departure gate is seen as a humiliating blow for a player who has already endured a torrid couple of years. Malacia has fought his way back from a devastating knee injury that kept him sidelined for over 18 months, only to find himself completely frozen out of the first-team picture upon his return. He was loaned to PSV for the second half of last season but started only six of the 12 games in which he appeared. 

He viewed a move to the Turkish Super Lig as a vital lifeline for a player seeking a chance to prove his fitness and get competitive miles in his legs away from the intense scrutiny of the Premier League. The sudden revocation of that permission, without a clear sporting justification communicated beforehand, has reportedly severed whatever trust remained between the player and the club's decision-makers.

The decision to block the move is all the more baffling given Malacia's standing in the squad. Since returning to fitness, he has not featured for the senior side, with the coaching staff preferring other options at left-back. With Luke Shaw fit and other versatile defenders available, Malacia was deemed surplus to requirements until the phone call at the airport.

With Patrick Dorgu out with an injury, the Red Devils opted to keep the Dutchman in case they need cover. With Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui preferred ahead of Malacia at left-back, though, he is not expected to see much of an increase in his playing time. The 26-year-old has made just one appearance for the senior side all season, clocking just two minutes in the 1-0 win against Newcastle.

For Malacia, this U-turn represents a crushing professional setback. After losing a significant chunk of his career to a complex meniscus injury and subsequent surgeries, he desperately needs match rhythm. Staying at United to sit in the stands or play occasional minutes for the Under-21s does nothing to restore his value or his confidence.

The Turkish transfer window remains open until February 6, so there may be a faint glimmer of hope that this deal could be resurrected if cooler heads prevail in the coming days. However, the nature of the blockage, suggests a definitive decision has been made to keep him.

Unless the situation changes rapidly, Malacia faces the prospect of spending the next five months rotting on the bench at Old Trafford, a ""prisoner"" of a contract that the club suddenly decided was too valuable to release. It is a cruel twist for a player who simply wanted the chance to play football again.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

CR7 urged to complete MLS transfer so he can make sensational 'transition to Hollywood' once his playing days are over","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/cristiano-ronaldo-the-actor-cr7-urged-to-complete-mls-transfer-so-he-can-make-sensational-transition-to-hollywood-once-his-playing-days-are-over/blt097a3401bd8ffeaa","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 13:44:23 GMT","

Cristiano Ronaldo has been urged to consider a shock move to Major League Soccer, but not merely to extend his playing career. A leading football finance expert believes the Portuguese icon is ""pretty enough"" to successfully launch a second career in Hollywood, suggesting a strategic switch to California could be the perfect bridge to enhance his global superstardom after hanging up his boots.

While speculation continues to link the 41-year-old with a sensational move to North America ahead of the 2026 World Cup, Dr Rob Wilson, Professor of Applied Sport Finance at UCFB, believes such a transfer would make little sense from a purely sporting or financial perspective. Speaking to Action Network, Wilson outlined that Ronaldo is now so deeply entrenched in the Middle East that a standard transfer would be detrimental to his brand. However, he identified one fascinating caveat that could change the entire equation: the allure of the silver screen.

Wilson argues that while a move for footballing reasons is illogical, a strategic switch to the US to launch a second career in entertainment would be a masterstroke. He suggests that Ronaldo's aesthetic appeal and global profile make him a prime candidate for a post-football career in cinema.

""It would be different if Ronaldo could get into Hollywood,"" Wilson stated, explicitly contrasting this unique path with a standard transfer. ""He's certainly pretty enough and iconic global movie and entertainment stars earn plenty more than sports stars so that would be an interesting move.""

If the Hollywood lights are not the target, Wilson is adamant that Ronaldo must stay put. The finance expert warns that a departure from Al-Nassr for anything less than a career transformation would be fraught with commercial danger. Ronaldo has become the face of the Saudi sporting project, and his brand is now ""embedded"" in the region's growth.

Wilson cautions that attempting to engineer an exit purely for a short-term footballing boost could backfire spectacularly, alienating a fanbase that has embraced him as a priority investment. The Saudi hierarchy views him as integral to their long-term vision, and walking away could be perceived as a betrayal.

""I just think he's so embedded in Saudi Arabia now and he would have to be really careful,"" Wilson explained. ""If he tried to engineer that sort of move and it failed, he would lose his brand recognition in the Middle East because they'd see him as only being out for the money, trying to do it elsewhere.""

He added: ""If he wanted a short-term payday then yes a move to MLS could give him a boost but for his long-term brand growth he is likely to stay in Saudi Arabia.""

With San Diego FC now competing in MLS, a switch to the Western Conference side could work out, as Wilson said: ""Ronaldo is a smart guy so if he could make a move out to California, score a few goals for San Diego and then transition into starring in Hollywood blockbusters that would be a reason to leave Saudi Arabia for the States.""

The prospect of Ronaldo joining Lionel Messi in MLS remains a fantasy for many marketing executives, especially with the World Cup on the horizon. However, Wilson believes the current separation of the two legends—with Messi in Miami and Ronaldo in Riyadh—actually serves their respective commercial interests better than a nostalgic reunion would.

He argues that bringing them together now would yield diminishing returns. The novelty would be intense but brief, potentially overshadowing the individual legacy Ronaldo is trying to cement in the Middle East.

""I think Messi and Ronaldo split between the USA and Saudi Arabia has worked quite well,"" Wilson observed. ""Bringing them together for one last go in MLS would be quality to see but it would be so short-lived that it would likely have a detrimental effect on Ronaldo's career.""

Ultimately, the decision may be dictated by Father Time. Wilson notes that if Ronaldo had considered this move ""two or three years ago,"" the potential for a successful American chapter would have been significantly higher. Now, as he navigates his 40s, he is ""clinging on"" to his playing career, leaving him with precious little time to build a new legacy in the States comparable to what he has achieved elsewhere.

""He's seen as a priority by people in the Middle East after having invested so heavily in him so it would be difficult for him to activate over there if he left,"" Wilson concluded. ""He wouldn't have enough years left to build something comparable in the States.""

Unless he is ready to trade the penalty box for the box office, it appears the smart money remains on Ronaldo finishing his career exactly where he is.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Chelsea's 2024-25 Women's Super League season was an all-timer. Undefeated through 22 games - the first team ever to achieve that in the competition's history - while also registering a record points return of 60, the Blues ascended to unprecedented levels of dominance in their first year under new head coach Sonia Bompastor. What has gone wrong, then, that means the six-time defending champions are on the brink of relinquishing their crown less than a year later?

On Sunday, Chelsea travelled north to face Manchester City, the champions-elect. Andree Jeglertz's side sat nine points clear at the top of the WSL table, with the Blues their closest, but still distant, rivals. And at the Etihad Stadium, the hosts showed just why that is the case, battering Bompastor's side 5-1.

It was Chelsea's biggest league loss in over seven years and, when coupled with the prior week's defeat to Arsenal, the first time they had lost back-to-back WSL games in 10 years. It also marked the first time ever in Bompastor's short - and very successful - managerial career that she has lost twice in a row in league competition.

City were brilliant, yes, but Chelsea were also poor - and not for the first time this season. Given how incredibly dominant the Blues were last season, it's been quite an incredible contrast to see them fall so far off the pace, with the gap to City now at 12 points with eight games remaining.

What has gone wrong? After winning six WSL titles in a row, how have they fallen out of this title race so early? And could it yet get worse?

In the early knockings of this season, it looked like the defence could be Chelsea's undoing this term. After building last year's treble-winning campaign on the foundation of an extremely sturdy back line, Bompastor took a different, more attack-minded approach this season.

""We want to take more risks in our game,"" she explained. ""I'm someone who really likes to take the risks. We want to be offensive.""

As a result, Chelsea have been allowing significantly more shots, shots on target, shot-creating actions and key passes to the opponent, per game, ever since the season kicked-off.

However, with Hannah Hampton playing as well as she has been, Chelsea have managed to largely keep the number of goals conceded down, even while their underlying numbers have become alarming. Instead, it's actually been in attack where the major issues have come, despite that front-footed and risk-happy approach Bompastor has gladly taken.

Chelsea's problem is rarely that they don't create chances. Even in their thrashing at City, the Blues had some notable opportunities. Instead, it's a lack of clinical touch that has regularly haunted the reigning champions this season.

Indeed, according to expected goals (xG) statistics, no one in the WSL is under-performing in front of goal as much as Chelsea. The Blues have found the net 25 times in 14 games, having registered a total xG of 30.35. That gap of 5.35 between the two numbers is huge, with Brighton, the next biggest under-performers in the WSL, only having a gap of 2.1.

It's something Bompastor noted in the build-up to Sunday's defeat to City, describing her side as having been ""a little bit less clinical than last season"". There are, she added, reasons to explain this, particularly given the injuries Chelsea have had to deal with.

""We are missing some top-class players, Mayra Ramirez being one of them,"" Bompastor said. ""I think she was available for most of the games last season and she was involved in the important games. We have some other really good players in the squad but as you know, some of them are coming back from injury. They are trying their best to perform at their best level but we have to be fair with them. You also need time to recover from not playing for two years, if we take the example with Sam [Kerr]. That's probably one of the explanations.""

Lauren James has spent a significant amount of time on the sidelines this season as well, while Aggie Beever-Jones has been dealing with an ankle problem and Catarina Macario hasn't featured in 2026.

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

After Ramirez was ruled out until at last 2026 back in September, Chelsea did spend big before the transfer deadline and brought in Alyssa Thompson, the 21-year-old forward who is their top scorer in the WSL this season, with five goals. But she didn't arrive as the final product. Thompson needed time to settle and find her groove, and is still a player in a developmental stage of her career, even if she has made a fantastic start to life in London. 

Given the uncertainties around the futures of Kerr and Macario beyond this season, and with Beever-Jones also on an expiring contract, as well as the overall under-performance in front of goal, one wondered if Bompastor might have wanted to add to her forward options further, either in the summer or in the winter transfer window, which closes on Tuesday. When Kerr suffered an ACL injury in January 2024, for example, Chelsea spent a club-record fee on Ramirez, whose arrival proved all the more important when Mia Fishel, Kerr's back-up, suffered the same injury a month later.

""Without making too many comments on that, I would have liked to have been in a better place from the last transfer window,"" Bompastor admitted on Sunday.

For some, hearing Bompastor bemoan a lack of depth, something she has done more than once this season, will trigger an almighty eye roll. After all, Chelsea have one of the best squads in the women's game. However, relative to the standard set at the club, this season's roster is a little weaker than previous ones and there is more trust having to be placed in young, inexperienced players for huge games, the kind of which they have not experienced before.

""A lot of people talk about Chelsea being an example of having depth in the squad and of having players with different profiles they can bring into the game. Right now, I don't think we are in that place,"" Bompastor reiterated on Sunday. ""I'm not saying that explains everything, but being in that position probably doesn't help.

""As a manager I will always [accept responsibility for] the results of this team, so I need to focus also on what the solutions are for me to be in a much better place. It's tough because I have to focus on the players available, but when you have many games in a row, you can't rotate as much as you want and you can't bring in the exact profile you want in the game.""

Asked if Chelsea, yet to make a signing in this ongoing transfer window, could act before the deadline on Tuesday, Bompastor replied: ""We'll see.""

It has all culminated in Chelsea losing that sense of inevitability that has followed them around for so long. Last season, 10 of the Blues' 19 league wins were decided by just one goal. In five of those games, the decisive strike was scored after the 80th minute. This term, with 14 of their 22 WSL games played, the reigning champions have won just three one-score games and have only scored twice beyond the 80th minute. Those goals, both from Kerr, were stoppage-time strikes that extended leads they already held.

""I think if you reflect from last season, even when we were winning a lot of games, sometimes the margins were really fine and we were able to sometimes score in the last minutes of the game. This season, things are probably not going the same way,"" Bompastor admitted last week.

Nothing highlights how incredibly different this season has been, compared to last, than the line of questioning that was directed at Bompastor after Sunday's chastening defeat. With the title out of reach and securing a Champions League spot now the main focus, the Frenchwoman was asked how confident she is that she will be in charge next Sunday, when the Blues take on a Tottenham side who could leapfrog them with a win.

Given the achievements of last season and the fact the club are still in the FA Cup, League Cup and Champions League, it would be a huge surprise to see Bompastor leave her post.

“I'm really confident in terms of someone who is really honest,"" she responded, starting her answer in a manner that reflected as much. However, as she continued, that feeling of certainty that she will remain for the foreseeable weakened ever so slightly.

""If people think I'm not the right person to stay for this job at the club, I'll be happy to go if they think that's the right thing,"" she added. “But I will never give up. I know football, sometimes it happens, you can be in this situation. I always fight. But again, the institution of Chelsea is a lot more important than myself.”

Chelsea still have a lot to fight for. There are still three trophies on the table, including that much-sought after Champions League title. But if Bompastor's Blues are going to enjoy a successful end to the 2025-26 season, they have to improve, and improve quickly.

As for the WSL, after six glorious seasons of dominance, Chelsea will finally be dethroned. Now, it's all about how they respond to disappointment neither they nor their manager are used to.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Terrible luck for Marc-Andre ter Stegen continues as Barcelona loanee facing possible surgery after suffering serious injury just two games into Girona stay","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/marc-andre-ter-stegen-barcelona-loanee-surgery-suffering-serious-injury-two-games-girona/bltc0c5a5ddcac680c8","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 12:38:57 GMT","

Marc-Andre ter Stegen faces a potential career crossroads after suffering a severe hamstring injury just two matches into his loan spell at Girona. The German goalkeeper is staring at a layoff of at least two months, with fears growing that surgery may be required to repair the damage. Barcelona and Girona are now in talks regarding the termination of his loan agreement.

What was supposed to be a career rehabilitation spell for Ter Stegen has turned into a nightmare scenario. After moving to Girona in the January window in search of regular first-team football, the German shot-stopper's stint at the Estadi Montilivi has been cruelly cut short almost before it began.

The injury occurred during the recent clash against Real Oviedo and while initial pitch-side assessments suggested a standard muscle strain, Cadena SER and Radio Girona report that subsequent examinations have revealed a much bleaker picture. The injury to his hamstring is described as ""more serious than initially feared,"" casting a dark cloud over his immediate future.

Ter Stegen had hoped to use this loan spell to prove his fitness and form after falling out of favour at Barcelona following Joan Garcia's signing in the summer. Instead, he now faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines, with early prognoses suggesting an absence of two months or more. For a goalkeeper in his mid-30s, such setbacks are increasingly difficult to recover from, and the mood within the player's camp is reportedly somber as they await the final medical verdict.

The severity of the injury has triggered immediate high-level discussions between the medical and sporting departments of both Barcelona and Girona. With Ter Stegen potentially ruled out for the remainder of the season, or at least a significant portion of it, the logic of keeping him on loan at Girona is rapidly diminishing.

Cadena SER reports that Barcelona are fully aware of the gravity of the situation and have not ruled out an immediate return for the goalkeeper. The Blaugrana medical staff prefer to oversee the rehabilitation of their own assets, particularly when surgery is a possibility. If the ""definitive diagnosis"" confirms a tear requiring surgical intervention, the loan agreement is likely to be rescinded to allow Ter Stegen to undergo treatment at Barcelona's Ciutat Esportiva facilities.

While no official decision has been communicated yet, the coordination between the two clubs suggests a resolution is imminent. For Girona, paying the wages of an injured loanee makes little fiscal sense, while for Barcelona, bringing him home ensures they can manage his recovery protocols directly.

While the two-month timeline is the current baseline, there are genuine fears that the layoff could be longer. The medical teams are currently waiting for the initial inflammation to subside before conducting the final battery of tests that will determine the exact grade of the tear. If surgery is required, Ter Stegen's season would almost certainly be over.

The player is reportedly undergoing further tests on Monday to establish a clear roadmap for recovery. The club acknowledges that this is a ""significant injury"" that will impact his immediate future, regardless of whose shirt he is technically wearing when the rehabilitation process begins.

The ripple effects of Ter Stegen's injury are being felt acutely in Girona's sporting directorate. With the transfer window set to close imminently, the club finds itself in a precarious position. A prolonged absence for their intended number one would leave them dangerously short of cover between the sticks for the remainder of the current campaign.

The injury has forced a radical change in planning in the final hours of the market. Girona simply cannot afford to wait and hope for a speedy recovery. Reports indicate they must now enter the market for an emergency replacement to strengthen the squad before the deadline passes.

Girona are hoping to clarify the true extent of the injury within hours to make a definitive decision on potential incoming transfers. It is a chaotic end to the window for the club, who thought they had solved their goalkeeping conundrum with the arrival of Ter Stegen, only to see those plans torn up after just 180 minutes of football.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Liverpool stun Chelsea to strike $82 million Jeremy Jacquet deal with Rennes in transfer twist","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/liverpool-chelsea-strike-60m-jeremy-jacquet-deal-rennes-transfer-twist/blt0b4a469e6c2981e8","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:48:55 GMT","

Liverpool have reportedly beaten Premier League rivals Chelsea to the signing of highly-rated Rennes defender Jeremy Jacquet. The Reds are said to have a £60 million ($82m) deal in place. The talented 20-year-old is considered to be a long-term addition at Anfield, with a big money agreement set to be completed in the summer transfer window.

Terms have been thrashed out at this stage, as the winter market prepares to close for business. Sky Sports are among those to report on how Jacquet will make his way to Merseyside ahead of the 2026-27 campaign.

It is said that the transfer package pieced together by Liverpool is worth £55m ($75m) as a guaranteed fee, with a further £5m made up in potential add-ons. Personal terms with the player are yet to be agreed, but they are “not expected to be an issue”.

The France Under-21 international is a product of Rennes' academy system and has taken in 18 appearances for the Ligue 1 outfit this season. A string of eye-catching performances have brought him to the attention of leading sides across Europe.

Jacquet has been registering on the radar at Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea considered to be leading the chase for his signature at one stage. The Blues are said to have held talks with the player and his representatives, but they will “not match Liverpool's bid”.

Sky Sports claims that “Chelsea offered exactly the same deal as Liverpool but over the past 48 hours, when it became apparent that Mamadou Sarr would be returning to Chelsea and Josh Acheampong was staying, the player changed his mind and decided to move to Liverpool”.

Jacquet is said to favour a move to Anfield as he is more likely to see regular game time with Liverpool. Chelsea's squad is already loaded with promising center backs, meaning that competition for places will be fierce.

The Blues currently have Trevoh Chalobah, Wesley Fofana, Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Axel Disasi, Aaron Anselmino and Jorrel Hato in their first-team squad, while England international Levi Colwill will return from an ACL injury by next season and Sarr is seeing a loan spell at Strasbourg cut short.

Liverpool, in contrast, are short on options at the heart of their back four. Joe Gomez and Giovanni Leoni are injured at present, while France international Ibrahima Konate is seeing his contract run down towards free agency. Club captain Virgil van Dijk will turn 35 in July.

Arne Slot had been hoping to add Marc Guehi to his ranks, as his deal ran down at Crystal Palace, but Manchester City stepped in and paid a fee for the 25-year-old in the winter window - forcing the Reds to look elsewhere.

Jacquet is considered to be a shrewd addition for Liverpool as he boasts the potential to become a key asset for the short and long-term future. His game can be taken to even greater heights.

French football expert Julien Laurens has told Sky Sports of Jacquet, with the youngster being compared to established stars on the books at Arsenal and Chelsea: “He's the real deal. I know he's only 20, he hasn't played for France and he hasn't played in the Champions League or Europa League.

“He has a long way to go but he's been impressive last season, after they [Rennes] called him back from his loan in the second division, and this season, with Habib Beye.

“You can't get it wrong. He is going to be amazing. He reminds me of when William Saliba burst onto the scene in France with Saint-Etienne, or Wesley Fofana.

“It's about how much you value that potential and talent. You would pay a lot of money for someone who hasn't really proved much. It's a lot of money for such a young player.”

Liverpool will hope to have Champions League football to offer Jacquet when his transfer is completed. They continue to compete for European glory this season and sit sixth in the Premier League table with 14 top-flight fixtures left to take in.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Arsenal silence the doubters, Lamine Yamal heats up and Bayern Munich suffer another blow: Winners and losers from the European weekend of football","https://www.goal.com/en-au/lists/arsenal-silence-doubters-lamine-yamal-heats-up-bayern-munich-suffer-another-blow-winners-losers-european-weekend-football/blt25ebe4971c75a799","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 12:05:29 GMT","

After all the drama provided by the Champions League in midweek, domestic action returned over the weekend, and it did not disappoint. Title races and battles to earn European spots are heating up around the continent, with there plenty of twists and turns still to come over the next three-and-a-half months.

The pace-setters remain the same in Europe's 'Big Five' leagues, but while the lead at the top was stretched in England, it was surprisingly cut again in Germany, and one of the main contenders fell by the wayside in France.

But who were the biggest winners and losers from the last three days of action? GOAL picks out five of each...

Arsenal headed into the weekend with questions over their title credentials ringing in their ears. A run of three Premier League games without a win had seen the gap at the top reduced to just four points, and a tricky-looking trip to Elland Road to face Leeds United shaped up as having real banana-skin potential.

However, the Gunners silenced any talk of them 'bottling' their best opportunity to win the title in a generation with a dominant 4-0 win in West Yorkshire. Noni Madueke led the way despite only being promoted to the starting line up minutes before kick-off after Bukayo Saka suffered an injury in the warm-up, while Viktor Gyokeres and Gabriel Jesus again both got on the scoresheet as the battle to start up front for Mikel Arteta's side continues to go back and forth between the pair.

Arsenal's win on Saturday was notable for its performance, but few onlookers went into Sunday's fixtures believing that it would allow the Gunners to stretch their lead at the top. However, after Aston Villa slipped to a shock home defeat to 10-man Brentford, Manchester City then followed that by somehow throwing away a two-goal lead at Tottenham despite the hosts having produced one of the most insipid first-half showings of any team all season.

All that means that Arsenal now hold a six-point advantage over second-placed City, and while the race isn't over yet, it feels as if Arteta's side have cleared another notable hurdle on their way to lifting the trophy for the first time since 2004.

Arsenal are edging towards the title, but the team whose crown they are set on taking, Liverpool, have merely got their sights set on securing Champions League football for next season. Last-gasp wins for Manchester United and Chelsea ensured that they remained ahead of the Reds in the table, but Arne Slot's side were able to take solace in one of their best displays of the season in beating Newcastle 4-1.

Despite falling behind to Anthony Gordon's first-half strike, Liverpool bounced back, with summer signings Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz taking most of the plaudits for another game where the duo showcased their burgeoning on-field relationship. Wirtz assisted Ekitike to net the Reds' equaliser before the France forward made it 2-1 on the stroke of half-time, with Wirtz then able to find the net himself to make the points safe after the break.

""Their combination gets better and better and better,"" Slot said of the duo to TNT Sports post-match. ""His [Ekitike's] second goal, I don't know if he knows who he is, but Romario, who played in Holland and Brazil, scored a lot of goals like this. It looked like a Romario goal, I have to say.""

On Wirtz, he added: ""When he had these moments earlier in the season, they did not lead to goals and assists, but now his numbers are much better... We could all see from the start he was this special player, but we are seeing it more now, because of the goals and assists.""

If Arsenal missing out on the title would be an 'epic bottle-job', what term could we use for Bayern Munich potentially chucking away the most dominant position within Europe's 'Big Five' leagues should their recent form continue?

Coming off the back of losing to Augsburg last week in a result that ended Bayern's hopes of an unbeaten league campaign, Vincent Kompany's side were held to a 2-2 draw by Hamburg on Saturday. The Bavarians fell behind to a Fabio Vieira penalty, only to turn the game on its head with goals either side of half-time from Harry Kane and Luis Diaz.

However, an equaliser from Tottenham loanee Luka Vuskovic ensured that Bayern would again drop points, with their lead now down to six, with games against third-placed Hoffenheim and second-placed Borussia Dortmund to come in February.

""There are no easy games,"" Kompany said post-match. ""We knew it was going to be a difficult away game because there are no easy opponents... My guys fought well, and I won't let anyone take that away from us. We've now played seven games in 20 days. In the end, this was a draw and not a defeat. Now, we're going to do what we always do. We'll show a reaction on the pitch.""

Over in Spain, Barcelona remain on top of La Liga after coming through a difficult clash against Elche with a 3-1 win that was inspired by Lamine Yamal. After a tough start to the season due in part to some minor injury problems, Yamal looks to be getting back to his best in 2026 after opening the scoring on Saturday to make it four goals in his last five games across all competitions.

Despite his 19th birthday not being until July, Yamal entered the season as the favourite to win the 2026 Ballon d'Or, but his less-than-eye-catching first few months of the campaign have allowed the likes of Kane, Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland to steal a march on him in the battle for the Golden Ball. However, with the Champions League knockouts around the corner, a tight Liga title race to win and the World Cup still to come, Yamal finding form now could catapult him back to the front of the race for the most prestigious individual award in the game.

""For everyone, it's good when he plays on the top level,"" said Hansi Flick of Barca's brilliant teenager, before revealing something that should have their rivals worried. ""He's young enough to improve, to have potential, to reach another level. I think it happens.""

Barca remain just a point above Real Madrid atop La Liga after Los Blancos scraped a barely-deserved 2-1 win over Rayo Vallecano on Sunday. Kylian Mbappe's penalty in the 10th minute of stoppage time proved to the winner, but much of the focus at the Bernabeu was on Jude Bellingham after he was forced off with a concerning hamstring injury in the first half.

Chasing a ball over the top in the right-hand channel, the England midfielder pulled up clutching the back of his left leg before collapsing in a heap on the by-line. After receiving some treatment, Bellingham was able to limp off under his own power to be replaced by Brahim Diaz, but Madrid's No.5 was clearly distressed by the injury as he visibly held back tears.

Madrid are yet to release any details as to the severity of the injury, but with the World Cup just four months away, there is a chance that Bellingham may now find himself in a race against time to prove himself ready for the summer tournament in North America.

Next season, Bellingham will likely be competing with Nico Paz for a place in the Madrid line up. The Argentina international has spent the past season-and-a-half starring for Como in Serie A, and it's widely expected that Los Blancos will exercise their buy-back option this summer.

The 21-year-old has contributed eight goals and six assists to Como's cause in Serie A this term, with that form helping put Cesc Fabregas' side in the hunt for a top-four finish less than two years after they were promoted to the top-flight. They would have been confident of improving their standing on Sunday, too, as Atalanta went down to 10 men in just the eighth minute of their encounter when teenage defender Honest Ahanor was sent off.

However, Como could not find a way through, only to be handed a lifeline deep into stoppage time when they were awarded a penalty. Paz stepped up, but had his 98th-minute spot-kick saved by Marco Carnesecchi, leaving the midfielder clearly distraught at having blown the opportunity to earn all three points.

""I don't want to kill a young player over a penalty. I am not like that,"" Fabregas said post-match. ""I missed penalties, so did Leo Messi, so did John Terry.""

""We are all with Nico, we are with the young players who have the courage to make a difference. A great champion must always lift his head back up when he hasn't done well.""

It's been a tumultuous week for Marseille. Last weekend, a 3-1 win over Ligue 1 leaders Lens gave Roberto De Zerbi's side hope of rekindling their own title hopes. However, they were then brought back down to earth in midweek when a 3-0 loss at Club Brugge, coupled with Anatoliy Trubin's dramatic stoppage-time goal for Benfica, knocked the French side out of the Champions League.

That result led to reports that both the club and De Zerbi himself were considering parting ways, and the mood wasn't helped on Saturday as, not for the first time this season, OM threw away points in a needless fashion. Marseille were 2-0 with eight minutes left against newly-promoted Paris FC, only to concede two late goals that forced them to settle for a point.

That result leaves them nine points adrift of Paris Saint-Germain at the top of the table, and with their hopes of a first championship since 2010 now having evaporated, Marseille must now be careful not to give up their place in the top three that guarantees Champions League football for next season, as in-form Lyon have moved level on points with them after winning 10 successive games across all competitions.

As mentioned, PSG remain on top of Ligue 1 as they battled through adversity to secure a vital 2-1 win over Strasbourg on Sunday. Their hosts had won each of their first three matches under new manager Gary O'Neil, and after missing an early penalty, showed great heart to equalise Senny Mayulu's opener during the first half.

Despite dominating possession, PSG were unable to create many more chances than Strasbourg, and things looked to be going against them with 15 minutes left as Achraf Hakimi was shown a red card. However, his opposite full-back was able to bail him out, as Nuno Mendes popped up at the back post six minutes later to head in the winner and keep the reigning champions two points ahead of second-placed Lens.

""Of course, I think our team gave everything,"" said Luis Enrique at full-time. ""Our first half was very poor. We controlled the game, but a long way from the opposition goal. It was difficult, but towards the end of the second half, we managed to have possession in their half. We created more chances.

""It was still quite complicated for us, but I think this is a very important win, for the confidence, and to maintain our position in the table. It was also important to help prepare for next week's game against Marseille.""

Benfica will have bounced into Sunday's clash with Tondela following Trubin's heroics against Real Madrid in midweek, but Jose Mourinho and Co. came back down to earth with a bump as they were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by their relegation-threatened hosts.

Mourinho's side are playing catch up in Liga Portugal as they aim to put pressure on unbeaten leaders Porto, but dropping two points against a team that has only managed three wins all season means any hope of a late-season title push are all-but over for 'The Special One' as he begins to plot for two more games against Madrid in the Champions League play-off round.

""We weren't effective,"" Mourinho said. ""Even with the difficult pitch conditions, the team tried to create chances and play until the end. The Tondela goalkeeper made some very valuable saves.

""What I feared was an emotional hangover from Wednesday's game and a lack of concentration or an arrogant attitude. But it was precisely the opposite. The team respected the game, played to win, did everything to win, deserved to win, but didn't win.""

Unlike Benfica, PSV were left to lick their wounds in midweek as defeat to Bayern Munich eliminated the Dutch champions from Europe for another season. However, Peter Bosz and his side were able to bounce back quickly on what proved to be a memorable Sunday for the manager, in particular.

Bosz first watched as his side raced into a 3-0 lead inside 17 minutes against Feyenoord, and though they were unable to add any further goals thereafter, the win leaves the Eindhoven outfit a massive 17 points clear at the top of the Eredivisie as they cruise towards a third successive title.

A few hours later, the club announced that Bosz had signed a two-year contract extension to put an end to speculation regarding his future and keep him at the Philips Stadium until 2028. As Sundays go, this wasn't a bad one for Bosz!","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

No. 3 Novak Djokovic, +1
The Serbian reached his 38th major final at the Australian Open but fell just short of clinching a record-extending 25th Slam and 11th in Melbourne. Djokovic defeated Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals to return to a Slam final for the first time since Wimbledon 2024, when he also lost to Alcaraz. It is the first time the 38-year-old is inside the Top 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings since August 2024. 

No. 24 Learner Tien, +5 (Career High)
The 20-year-old has climbed to a career high after he became the youngest American man to reach the quarter-finals of a major since 2002. The American earned an impressive straight sets win against Daniil Medvedev, improving to 3-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Tien ended 2025 in style when he lifted the Next Gen ATP Finals crown.

No. 54 Tomas Martin Etcheverry, +8
The Argentine is up eight spots following a productive week at the Australian Open. The 26-year-old earned two wins, including a five-set triumph against Miomir Kecmanovic, before he was stopped by Alexander Bublik.

No. 61 Marin Cilic, +9
The 37-year-old Croatian demonstrated that he is still a force to be reckoned with after a third-round showing in Melbourne. The 2018 finalist did not drop a set against Denis Shapovalov or Daniel Altmaier. Stan Wawrinka, 40, also performed impressively in Australia, becoming the oldest man to reach the third round since Ken Rosewall. The Swiss star is up 26 places to No. 113 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

No. 68 Ethan Quinn, +12
Quinn has jumped 12 places. The 21-year-old American beat seed Tallon Griekspoor and Hubert Hurkacz to advance to the third round at a major for the second time (Roland Garros 2025).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Creativity and 'a big luck': Oliynykova claims first WTA win in Cluj-Napoca","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4442840/creativity-and-a-big-luck-oliynykova-claims-first-wta-win-in-cluj-napoca","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 09:49:31 GMT","

Oleksandra Oliynykova claimed the first WTA main-draw win of her career late on Sunday night at the Transylvania Open, overcoming Mayar Sherif 6-7(6), 6-4, 6-4 in 2 hours and 54 minutes from 3-1 down in the third set -- and revealed afterward that she was lucky to be at the tournament at all.

Cluj-Napoca: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The Ukrainian captured hearts two weeks ago at the Australian Open with her positive demeanor, valiant first-round challenge against defending champion Madison Keys and heartfelt words about her soldier father on her country's frontline. She had to navigate the perils of living in a war zone again just to get to Cluj-Napoca when Kyiv suffered a widespread power outage last week.

""When I was losing in the third set in some moments, I said to myself just to enjoy being here, because actually it's a big luck to compete in this tournament,"" Oliynykova said in her on-court interview.

""I live and practice in Kyiv and because of Russian attacks, we have very big problems with electricity. Two hours before my train -- because I live on the 20th floor -- I'm entering the lift and electricity just turns off. In the end, I was just 10 minutes before my train left. So actually it's a big luck.

""I just said to myself, 'C'mon, there was a possibility that you would not come to this tournament. Try to enjoy it, try to play more free and more creative.' And actually, that was the key today to win.""

There was plenty of creativity on show from both players throughout the enthralling contest. Lung-busting rallies and chess-like tactics were the order of the day as Oliynykova and Sherif deployed every tool at their disposal to out-manoeuvre each other. A series of exquisite drop shots from the Egyptian saw her sneak a top-quality first-set tiebreak after saving one set point, but Oliynykova bounced back superbly. Her variety and point construction proved crucial: Oliynykova frequently used high moonballs as an offensive weapon, pushing Sherif behind the baseline before flattening out her own strokes for winners.

The 24-year-old visibly gave her all in the deciding set, winning two of her best points of the match despite slipping over as she won five of the last six games. Watch the full highlights below.

Oliynykova will face No. 8 seed Anna Bondar in the second round after the Hungarian escaped Ella Seidel 4-6, 7-6(6), 6-0 after coming within two points of defeat in the second-set tiebreak.

CAREER SLAM COMPLETE 🤯🏆🏆🏆🏆 pic.twitter.com/OyJwC162qR

Having won his first US Open title at age 19, his first Wimbledon title at age 20 and his first Roland Garros title at age 21, it's only fitting that Alcaraz would win his first Australian Open title this year at age 22.The Happy Slam had been a thorn in his side, though, his best results coming into this year's edition being two quarterfinals—he fell to Alexander Zverev in that round in 2024 and to Djokovic in 2025.This year, after a 7-5, 6-2, 6-1 victory over Alex de Minaur to finally get over the quarterfinal hump, the Spaniard got revenge against Zverev in the semifinals with a grueling 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-7 (3), 6-7 (4), 7-5 victory, overcoming cramping and battling back from 5-3 down in the fifth set to outlast the German after five hours and 27 minutes on court.

Things looked dicey for a while against Djokovic in the final, as the 10-time Australian Open champion came out swinging, breaking twice and never facing a break point himself to clinch the first set in 33 minutes.But the momentum shifted from there, as Alcaraz started cutting down on the unforced errors—after hitting nine in the first set, he had 10 in the second and third sets combined—and he broke Djokovic twice in each of those next two sets, soon finding himself up two sets to one.After holding serve in the opening game of the fourth set, Alcaraz brought up six break points in the next game but couldn't convert, and the two fell into a holding pattern, trading games back and forth—Djokovic actually brought up a break point in Alcaraz's 4-all service game, but the Spaniard saved it and ended up holding.A few games later, with Djokovic serving at 5-6, Alcaraz generated his first match point when Djokovic missed a forehand into the net, and another forehand miss from the Serb on the next point sealed the win.

Djokovic, who had reached the record-extending 38th Grand Slam final of his career in Melbourne this year—and who was going for a record-extending 25th major title, as well—congratulated Alcaraz right out of the gates during his speech at the on-court trophy ceremony.“What you've been doing, I think the best word to describe it is historic, legendary,” the 24-time Grand Slam champion said. “So congratulations, and I wish you the best of luck for the rest of your career.“I mean, you're so young, you have a lot of time, like myself,” he added. “I'm sure we'll see each other many more times in the next 10 years!”Likewise, Alcaraz started his speech by congratulating Djokovic.""Obviously, first of all, I just wanted to talk about Novak. He deserves an ovation, for sure,"" the now-seven-time major winner said. ""You're talking about how I'm doing the amazing things, but what you're doing is really inspiring, not only for the tennis players, but all the athletes and people around the world, and for me as well.

F1 Barcelona Shakedown 2026: Day 5 Highlights

Newey 'always teaching us something', says Fernando Alonso

In the latest edition of Santander's Driving Tomorrow series Jenson Button offers advice for prospective talents and discusses how F1 drivers of the future might get their start in racing.

Jenson Button raced in over 300 Grands Prix across a distinguished career in Formula 1, triumphing on 15 occasions and famously winning the World Drivers' Championship in 2009. He remains involved in Formula 1 through his role as a broadcaster and, in the latest edition of Santander's Driving Tomorrow series, he offers advice for prospective talents and discusses how F1 drivers of the future might get their start in racing.

Jenson Button started out in Formula 1 at the age of just 20, beginning a lengthy journey in the championship that saw him drive for Williams, Renault, Honda and McLaren, while it was with the phoenix from the ashes team of Brawn GP that he claimed world title honours in 2009.

But his path towards Formula 1 really got underway at the age of eight, when he started out competing in go-karting, treading the route taken by the majority of drivers who work their way towards the championship.

Nowadays, there is a tendency for drivers to start out at an even younger age, with some as young as four or five getting behind the wheel of a go-kart.

“The age you start, I don't think it's really that important as long as you are in karting as a kid,” Button says. “The more important thing is to have the right people around you that are supporting you, whether it's good or bad. And you've got to be having fun. None of this is worth it unless you're having fun!

“I had a wobble when I was 13 and wasn't sure if I wanted to race any more. You can't look at karting and go, ‘if I'm good at karting, I'm going to be a world champion in F1.' Such a small percentage of people get the opportunity to race in Formula 1.

“You've got to go into karting, whatever age it is, and enjoy it and have fun. And if it works out, that's great. For me, it was something to do with my old man on the weekends and I loved that. And that relaxed atmosphere really got the best out of me.”

The karting scene is nonetheless a common foundation for aspiring racing drivers, given the invaluable lessons, the closely-fought nature of the competition, and the window it provides into motorsport.

“Karting is massive,” Button says. “It's where you learn racecraft, it's where you learn to go wheel-to-wheel with other people. When I look back at my karting career, it's some of the best memories of my racing career because everything's so close – half a tenth of a second separates 10 people in qualifying – so you've got to get everything out of it.

“You are going up against a lot of very talented people. I did a lot of my racing in Italy, across Europe, and [for] the world championship, and you have to kind of go to places like that when you start taking it seriously. But first of all, it's all about just getting to grips with a little machine, and making it feel like it's an extension of your body.”

Since Button's era technology has already advanced to a stage whereby simulators are now widely used, sometimes just for gaming purposes, other times by drivers – such as Max Verstappen – to hone their skills, try new techniques, or even simply wile away the hours.

Some drivers in other motorsport disciplines started out by gaming before they made the real-life crossover, so could such a scenario unfold in Formula 1 in the future?

“I think gaming is an interesting one,” Button says. “The reason being they're a lot cheaper than karting. When I raced, karting was reasonable and now it's very expensive, even just racing on a weekend; I've done a couple of kart races over the last few years and it's expensive.

“[Simulators] are a lot more cost effective and you can really hone your skills. You can't drive a go kart 24/7, whereas a simulator, you can if you really wanted to! You can do a lot of the engineering side of things as well with the detail of the simulations.

“I do think that you need real world driving as well, because I think you need to understand safety, the limitations of a car yourself, and that you can't just push the reset button. I think we'll see a bit of both, it might be the jump start from gaming could be very good, but then I think you need to be jumping into karts or single-seaters at a relatively early age.”

Female interest in Formula 1 has grown exponentially in recent years, with more fans, and more women working across a plethora of roles in the championship. Button is hopeful that a range of initiatives, including F1 ACADEMY, will eventually propel a woman into a race seat after a prolonged absence, but also believes mindsets still need altering.

“I think that the great thing about F1 ACADEMY is that it gives young girls something to aspire to,” Button says. “We just don't have enough girls in grassroots racing at the moment. It's obviously growing, but it's still a very small percentage of kids that go karting. That's the bigger thing. It's teaching parents that girls can race cars as well, and I think that's probably the biggest part of it.

“Because when you think how many boys there are that are racing karts, when you're trying to find the talent, it's a lot easier, whereas there's a lot less to choose from with girls racing. So we will see a woman in Formula 1 in the future, but it's going to take a bit of time.”

While getting into Formula 1 remains a challenge, so too is choosing the right time to walk away. For those that can leave on their own terms some do so in their 30s, while others press on way into their 40s.

Button stepped away full-time from Formula 1 at the end of 2016, at the age of 36, and believes it is essential for retiring Formula 1 racers to have a breadth of interests outside of the championship.

“I was 100 per cent ready and it was the right decision,” Button says. “For others, maybe being around the paddock is more important. I wanted to start a family. I wanted to try other things in my racing. I didn't want to just be an F1 driver. I wanted to be a Super GT driver, a NASCAR driver and try Le Mans. And that was fun to me. That was exciting.”

Button would nonetheless urge drivers through their competitive years to ensure that they are surrounded by a tight-knit group of people upon whom they can completely rely, aiding the transition into a non-F1 life.

“As an F1 driver, you have to be so focused on driving,” Button says. “I had a manager, a PR man, I had a physio, a personal assistant, I had someone to do everything for me, so that I could just focus on what I needed to, which was training, eating the right things, spending enough time with the team, engineering, driving the race car.

“You need a good group of people around you to be looking after what happens after F1. Post-F1 it's not what you do business wise, it's what you do in terms of something you're passionate about.

“That's what you need. Because when you walk away from a high pressure, high stakes, adrenaline junkie sport like this, a lot of people struggle with that mentally. So it's finding something that you're passionate about that you can jump into after racing.”

F1 Barcelona Shakedown 2026: Day 5 Highlights

Newey 'always teaching us something', says Fernando Alonso

Following the AMR26's debut laps at the Barcelona Shakedown, Fernando Alonso has been reflecting on how it felt and the impact that Adrian Newey has had on the Aston Martin team.

Fernando Alonso has been reflecting on Adrian Newey's input after taking the designer's debut Aston Martin car for its first laps during the Barcelona Shakedown, with the Spaniard admitting that Newey is “always teaching us something”.

While many teams started their programmes earlier in the week during the five-day event – with each squad permitted to run on three out of the five days – Aston Martin announced early on that they intended to run on Thursday and Friday.

It was during the latter half of Thursday afternoon that the British outfit sent the AMR26 out on track for its maiden laps with Lance Stroll at the wheel, before Alonso gained further mileage on Friday.

Sharing his initial thoughts on how the shakedown had gone for Aston Martin after jumping out of the car, Alonso said: “It was good. Definitely excited to be back in the car after the winter, and for us it's the first day.

“I know some other teams did filming days or shakedowns at the beginning of January and then the whole week here in Barcelona, but for us it was really the very first days, so I think we had a positive one, 60+ laps and the car is responding well. First day, and more to come.”

As well as the introduction of new technical regulations in 2026, the season ahead also marks some big changes for Aston Martin, with the car being the first designed by Newey – who will also act as Team Principal going forward – while it is also the debut campaign of the squad's partnership with Honda.

With all of that in mind, Alonso was quizzed on how special it felt to take the AMR26 out for the first time, to which the two-time World Champion smiled: “It was very special, yesterday with Lance and today with me in the car, it was special for us – the first car made by Adrian and together with Honda and Aramco and these new rules.

“And especially the last two weeks has been very, very intense, the factory trying to have the car ready and we just made it to Barcelona in the last two days. A tremendous effort from everyone – I think it was phenomenal, the last 48 hours, and thanks to everyone in the team here, at the factory, and looking forward to Bahrain now.”

Alonso went on to share an insight into the impact that Newey's presence has had on the team since his arrival earlier last year.

“Everyone is super motivated when we see him in the garage taking care of all the details,” the Spanish driver explained.

“I see all the mechanics, the faces, everyone is looking at him, trying to spot something that maybe he comments about the car or he wants to improve. He's teaching us always something.”

Newey 'always teaching us something', says Fernando Alonso

With the festive period over and racing on the horizon, how have the drivers been spending their time away from racing during the off-season? Take a sneak peek into the life of the drivers off-track...

With an exciting brand-new season just around the corner, the drivers have been back to work putting in the miles at the Barcelona Shakedown. However, after a quiet month in December, there was still some time before travelling to Barcelona to get in some downtime, and there will be a few more opportunities ahead of the first pre-season test in Bahrain.

From intense training camps to basketball matches and even an engagement, the drivers have made the most of their time away from racing. Some joined in on Olympic preparations, others headed to cycling races or laced up running shoes – and several unsurprisingly couldn't resist more time behind the wheel...

With the Winter Olympics and Paralympics on the horizon, drivers have been getting into the spirit themselves during the off-season. Ollie Bearman and Pierre Gasly both headed for the mountains as part of their pre-season preparations, an adrenaline-filled break balancing serious training with some well-earned fun in the snow.

Enjoying his start to the year as Red Bull reserve, Yuki Tsunoda also got in on some chilly action, but with a competitive twist. Showing off his skills on the snowboard, Tsunoda took part in a charity team competition in Austria that was also attended by Sebastian Vettel – a wholesome reunion!

And then there was Kimi Antonelli. The Italian enjoyed a truly special moment as he carried the Olympic torch through the streets of Palmanova ahead of his home Winter Games. The rain didn't dampen his spirits, even breaking into a run for the final section – classic racing driver competitiveness! It was certainly an unforgettable honour, and we're sure the 19-year-old will be following the action closely.

The new year and season have clearly put a few members of the grid in a reflective mood. Lance Stroll marked 20 years as a racing driver by sharing a wholesome montage tracing his journey from his go-karting days to F1, capturing the highest highs and the lowest lows throughout that time. It was a heartwarming compilation that demonstrated all the hard work and dedication that goes into a driver's journey to the top of the sport. We're looking forward to seeing another reminiscent video recap in another 20 years, Lance!

Meanwhile, new Racing Bulls recruit Arvid Lindblad celebrated his first days as an F1 driver by taking a trip down memory lane – albeit a slightly shorter one than Stroll, given he's still only 18! A series of throwback snaps charted his rapid rise through the ranks, and it's safe to say that young Arvid sat in a toy car all those years ago would be pretty proud. We're not crying… you are!

Never one to miss a trend, Franco Colapinto treated fans to a throwback collection of photos showing a fresh-faced 12-year-old Franco in 2016. One thing that hasn't changed in the last decade? His love of being behind the wheel. There's even a surprise cameo from a young Sergio Perez during his Force India days, with the Cadillac man commenting how old this blast from the past made him feel – us too, Sergio, us too.

The calm and relaxation of December is long behind the drivers now – intense training is back in full swing. Pre-season camps are up and running, with the likes of Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz putting in the miles running and cycling to sharpen their cardio. Valtteri Bottas put a competitive spin on his training, taking part in a gravel bike race in his adopted homeland of Australia.

Running and gym work were high on the priority list for Gasly, Lindblad, and Stroll, as the paddock get their bodies ready for another physically demanding year of racing.

Despite the extended time away from racing, January has still delivered some moments worthy of celebration. Congratulations are in order for Albon and his fiancée, Lily Muni He, who got engaged at the start of the month – announcing it on social media with an adorable snap showing off the ring!

Meanwhile, at the shakedown in Barcelona, Perez had an exciting birthday gift – taking his Cadillac for plenty of testing laps! A tough but valuable day at work for the Mexican, but his day was made a bit more memorable as his new team gave the 36-year-old the unforgettable gift of their first brake disc!

You know that racing isn't too far away when drivers' social feeds start filling up with liveries, team kits and behind-the-scenes content – and January has already delivered a wave of design reveals, leaving the drivers feeling like kids at Christmas!

Alpine duo Gasly and Colapinto headed to Barcelona for their floating reveal on a boat, while Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton shared behind-the-scenes moments from Ferrari's launch at their test track in Fiorano. New team mates Max Verstappen and Isack Hadjar crossed the pond for Red Bull's unveiling in Detroit, celebrating the team's new powertrain partnership with Ford and fresh throwback livery in fittingly bold surroundings. Audi, meanwhile, marked the start of their F1 era with a launch in Berlin, as Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto got their first look at the car following the transition from Kick Sauber.

And there's plenty more still to come! With Williams, Cadillac, McLaren and Aston Martin yet to reveal the look of their 2026 challengers, expect drivers' feeds to stay busy in the weeks ahead...

You can't keep F1 drivers away from things with four wheels, and for two French drivers, the temptation to feel speed again was just too much. Hadjar found himself in the passenger seat during a Red Bull rally-raid challenge – he looked like he enjoyed himself between the hair-raising drops and climbs!

Go-karts and buggies were on the agenda for Esteban Ocon, who posted a YouTube video featuring his antics at the Aunay-les-Bois International Circuit in France. You can't keep these guys away from chasing thrills!

In the calm before the storm of a new season, there's always time for family and friends. Leclerc combined training, family time, and playtime with dog Leo, of course, while he was back in Monaco. Oscar Piastri returned Down Under for a relaxing break away from the limelight, and Liam Lawson was busy in New Zealand dirt biking, being on uncle duty, and DJing!

F1 Barcelona Shakedown 2026: Day 5 Highlights

Newey 'always teaching us something', says Fernando Alonso

George Russell says he's ready to fight for a World Championship in 2026, while also harboring hopes of going toe to toe with four-time champion Max Verstappen.

George Russell says he's ready to fight for the Formula 1 world title with Mercedes but admits that, while the Barcelona Shakedown was encouraging, it's ""too early to say"" if this year's Silver Arrows will be the leading contender.

Mercedes had a very productive three days of running at a cold Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya as drivers and teams focused on understanding their new machines that have been built to sweeping new chassis and power unit regulations for 2026 – rather than looking at performance.

Russell is entering his eighth season in Formula 1 and has five Grand Prix wins under his belt, with many feeling his performances last year were his best yet.

""I feel ready to fight for a World Championship, and whether we have that comment above us or not, that does not change my approach one single bit,"" said Russell, when speaking to media as Mercedes officially launched their 2026 F1 campaign.

""I'm working so hard with the team, everybody here has been working flat out to really maximise this new set of regulations. I'm honestly just so excited by the challenge, because it is a huge challenge adapting to these new cars, how the energy management works, the re-harvesting of the batteries, getting your head around the boost system, the overtake modes, the active aero.

""There's a lot of things we need to learn very quickly, but I feel I can take advantage from that, and I feel confident with myself and my team.""

When asked how he feels about potentially going up against four-time world champion Max Verstappen in a title fight, Russell said: ""I'd love for it to turn out that way. I do want to go head-to-head with Max and obviously Lando [Norris] had a great season last year.

""But no, it doesn't add any more pressure. I think probably the fans and people were expecting, you know, to potentially be Mercedes versus McLaren because there was a lot of anticipation that Mercedes would clearly have the best power unit.

""But it seems like the other power unit manufacturers have done a good job and we know that Red Bull have always had an amazing car, even through the years of dominance of Mercedes. It was their engine that was letting them down, not their car.

""And we obviously know how good Max is. So, yeah, I think he's very much going to be in the fight this year. And, you know, that is great. You obviously wish that you'd have a slightly easier time of it but it should never be easy and if you're going to win, you want to have fought for it and won it fair and square on track.""

Speaking about Russell's title credentials, boss Toto Wolff said: ""It is always nice if your driver is the favourite with the bookmakers, and I think he [Russell] deserves it because he is one of the best. He has shown us where the performance of the car is and has overall been more than great to us.

“But it is always the best driver and the best car that wins, and we have not proven yet that we have a package that is good enough. I hope the bookmakers are right but I'll believe it when we have seen performances that would confirm that.""

There was no chase for performance in Barcelona, as the focus really was on learning about the cars and the new systems that are in place for this year – and that's why Russell is keen not to get ahead of himself. But he did concede that Mercedes – who have failed to contend for the title since 2021 – are in a better place, probably their best since 2021, at this point in the year.

""Well, obviously we've only driven the car for three days, and it's still very early days, but quoting Toto, it doesn't look like it's a ****, which is a bonus,"" he said. ""And to be honest, in the early days like this, when it could be a really bad car, and you can sort of highlight those negatives early on, we don't believe it is.

""But is it a car that can produce a World Championship? It's still way too early to see.""

He added: ""We left Barcelona with a positive feeling, because the car reacted as we anticipated. The numbers we're seeing from the aero on the car match what we see back on the simulator. How the car is handling is matching how it feels on the simulator.

""This is something we've not really experienced since 2021 as a team so we're sort of ticking the boxes of everything that we want to tick, but we can't discount our rivals, because as I said, there was a lot of talk around the Red Bull power unit not being up to standard in year one, but from what we've seen so far, they've definitely delivered.

""The Ferrari power unit looks reliable. They did lots of laps not far behind us over the course of the test. So the truth is that there could be a good fight on our hands, but we're satisfied with what we've experienced so far.""

Mercedes, like all of their rivals, are playing down their expectations for this year – and that's no surprise given they are running very different cars with all-new power units built to regulations that have seen the biggest overhaul in more than a decade.

But it is clear that as a starting point, Mercedes are in a better place – as Russell said – than they have been in recent years. The Silver Arrows failed to get on top of the ground effect-era cars - and therefore were not contenders for the last four World Championships.

Ahead of each of those campaigns, Mercedes knew very early on that they were not the favourites – and that they would struggle to get in the mix. This time around, though, they don't have that same feeling. Critically, the car is performing as their simulation tools said they would. There is hope.

This is the first time that Russell will have felt that feeling since he joined Mercedes in 2022 – so it's perhaps not surprising that he is buoyed by how the car feels after three days of running. He even said in his media briefing that he felt confident to push from the very first lap in Barcelona.

Based on vibes, these are the best Mercedes have given off since 2021. Of course, Russell and the team don't know what the other teams are doing so it would be unwise to get too excited.
But given Mercedes have history of delivering a class-leading power unit at a regulation change and that they feel encouraged by the response by the chassis in early runs (which is the opposite of what they have felt for the last four years) you can understand why there is a bit of a spring in their step.

We should get more of an idea of where they stack up next week in Bahrain when work on the set-up of the cars begins – and an even clearer look in the second test when they start chasing performance but it might not be until Australia – or even the first four or five races – until we know for sure if Mercedes are back in the game as world title contenders.

F1 Barcelona Shakedown 2026: Day 5 Highlights

Newey 'always teaching us something', says Fernando Alonso

Jenson Button has switched his ambassadorial duties from Williams to Aston Martin for 2026.

F1 World Champion Jenson Button is joining Aston Martin as a Team Ambassador ahead of the 2026 season, the Silverstone-based squad have announced.

Button, who previously carried out a similar role at Williams, will support Aston Martin's media, partner and commercial activities in a multi-year agreement, bringing “a unique blend of credibility, global recognition and storytelling power to the role”.

Button's career spanned almost two decades, covering stints at Williams, Benetton, Renault, BAR/Honda, Brawn GP and McLaren – the Briton claiming 15 Grand Prix victories and the 2009 world title.

After his time in F1, which included 14 more victories and the 2009 world title, Button went on to contest and win the Super GT Championship in Japan with Honda, who have become Aston Martin's engine partners for 2026 and beyond.

Button will also reunite with two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso, the pair having been McLaren team mates during the 2015 and 2016 seasons.

“Joining Aston Martin Aramco during such a transformative time in the team and the sport's history is really exciting for me,” said Button.

“Honda's new works partnership with the team was a huge draw and I look forward to bringing my years of experience working with them to my new role as ambassador.

“The 2026 season is going to be fascinating and being part of such an ambitious team is a real opportunity. I can't wait for Melbourne!”

Jefferson Slack, Managing Director of Commercial at Aston Martin's F1 team, added: “Jenson is one of the most respected figures in modern Formula 1 and we are delighted to welcome him to Aston Martin Aramco as Team Ambassador.

“He brings World Championship pedigree, deep experience with Honda, and an outstanding ability to connect with fans and partners around the world.

“As we enter the sport's defining new era in 2026, Jenson's insight and presence will be a valuable asset as we continue building this team for long-term success.”

The singer, writer and producer landed record of the year for Kendrick Lamar and SZA's 'Luther.' 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


Jack Antonoff has entered from rare Grammy air. 


	The singer, songwriter and producer became just the fourth person to win all four major categories — album, record, song of the year and best new artist — which he completed at Sunday's show.




	Antonoff was only missing record of the year, which he won for producing “Luther” from Kendrick Lamar and SZA at the 2026 Grammy Awards; he also had a second chance at the award for producing fellow record nominee “Manchild,” from Sabrina Carpenter.

	He had previously won best new artist as a member of the group Fun, along with song of the year for the band's hit tune “We are Young.” He also has three album of the year wins as a frequent collaborator of Taylor Swift, for her albums 1989, Folklore and Midnights.

	











	The only other musicians who have completed that “Big Four” feat are Christopher Cross, Billie Eilish and Adele; Cross (in 1981) and Eilish (in 2020) were both able to achieve all four major wins in one night.  


	Antonoff was up for seven awards at Sunday's show, with 11 previous total wins coming into the evening. He joined Lamar, SZA and their producing team on stage for the record of the year win but didn't take a turn at the mic; instead, SZA took a moment to say amid the current political moment, “Please don't fall into despair. I know that right now is a scary time; I know the algorithm is telling us that it's so scary and all is lost. There's been world wars, there's been plagues and we have gone on. We can go on, we need each other, we need to trust each other and trust ourselves, trust our heart. We're not governed by the government, we're governed by God.”

Disney has the right to buy back the NFL's stake beginning in July 2034, with the league holding an option to acquire more of ESPN.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


ESPN is valued at about $30 billion, with the National Football League's 10 percent equity stake in the sports media giant securing an estimated fair market value of $3 billion, according to The Walt Disney Co.'s latest quarterly earnings report.


	Disney and the NFL closed their mega deal in the last week, giving the league its non-controlling interest, leaving Disney with 72 percent, and Hearst with 18 percent. According to the company's 10-Q, Disney will have an option to reacquire the NFL's stake in ESPN after July 2034, based on the division's performance, in exchange for a ten-year note at 70 percent of the then fair market value of the NFL's interest in ESPN. The league, meanwhile, has an option to acquire an additional 4 percent of ESPN on a similar timetable, also at 70 percent market value.

	The deal will see ESPN fully own NFL Network, with plans to bake it into the ESPN streaming service. The RedZone channel, meanwhile, will join Disney's linear portfolio, with Disney also planning to merge its ESPN fantasy football product with NFL Media's fantasy product. The NFL will also license games, RedZone, NFL Films programming and other content and rights to ESPN, with the sports media company also securing rights to the RedZone brand to use for other sports.

	Perhaps most importantly, Disney will be getting the exclusive games that had lived with NFL Network, giving it more inventory.

	











	Disney is expected to integrate the NFL's media assets in the coming weeks and months.


	“We're really happy that we were able to close it when we did, that enables us to get started sooner than we actually had anticipated,” Disney CEO Bob Iger told Wall Street analysts Monday. “So the upcoming NFL season, which will end in ESPN first Super Bowl is a huge opportunity for ESPN, not only in terms of its ability to manage the NFL Network and RedZone, but also with more NFL inventory. And we know how valuable that is, and how valuable it will be, particularly for ESPN streaming business.”


	The quarter also revealed just how vulnerable ESPN remains to the pay-TV ecosystem. All of Disney's channels, including ESPN, were dark for weeks on YouTube TV last quarter, the company's longest blackout in its history. The company disclosed a $110 million hit to operating income due to the blackout, underscoring how reliant ESPN remains to the ecosystem, even after launching its standalone streaming platform last year.


	Per Disney's fiscal Q1 earnings report, the sports division (which is almost entirely comprised of ESPN) had revenue of $4.9 billion and operating income of $191 million.

CEO Bob Iger said Monday that he was ""incredibly proud of all that we've accomplished over the past three years,"" setting the stage for an expected exit in the coming months.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	With a succession decision expected in the very near future, The Walt Disney Co. delivered a Wall Street beat in its latest quarter, a hard-earned win and perhaps even a sendoff for CEO Bob Iger, who is widely expected to step aside in the coming months, ahead of his end of 2026 contract expiration (Josh D'Amaro, Disney's experiences chairman, is seen as the internal favorite to succeed him). 


	It is not clear whether Iger will stay with the company in some other capacity like with a board seat after he steps aside as CEO. 




	“We are pleased with the start to our fiscal year, and our achievements reflect the tremendous progress we've made,” Iger said in a statement tied to earnings. “We delivered strong box office performance in calendar year 2025 with billion-dollar hits like Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash, franchises that generate value across many of our businesses. “As we continue to manage our company for the future, I am incredibly proud of all that we've accomplished over the past three years.”

	On the earnings call, Iger was asked about his own elevation to CEO, both his original promotion, and his return three years ago, and what it could imply as he prepares to step aside.

	“I think what is noteworthy is that when I came back three years ago, I had a tremendous amount that needed fixing. But anyone who runs a company also knows that it can't just be about fixing. It has to be about preparing a company for its future and really putting in place, taking steps to create opportunities for growth so well,” Iger told the analysts. “The good news is that the company is in much better shape today than it was three years ago, because we have done a lot of fixing, but we've also put in place a number of opportunities, including the investment across our experiences business to essentially expand at every location that we do business and on the high seas.”

	











	“I also believe that in a world that changes as much as it does that in some form or another, trying to preserve the status quo is a mistake, and I'm certain that my successor will not do that,” Iger added. “So they'll be handed, I think, a good hand in terms of the strength of the company, a number of opportunities to grow and and also the exhortation that in a world that changes you also have to continue to change and evolve as well.”


	Disney delivered revenue of $26 billion in the quarter, its fiscal Q1, with segment operating income of $4.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.63. The street had projected revenue of $25.6 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.58.


	A strong film slate in the quarter and a streaming business that continues to grow bolstered Disney's entertainment division, while experiences delivered record revenues and operating income.


	Entertainment revenues were $11.6 billion, with operating income of $1.1 billion, an increase of 7 percent and a decline of 35 percent year-over-year, with the YouTube TV blackout and higher costs offset by a strong theatrical slate and improvements in streaming. The success of the latest Avatar film will also flow into the current quarter.


	Streaming revenues were $5.3 billion, with operating income of $450 million, up substantially from a year ago. Fiscal Q1 was the first quarter in which Disney stopped disclosing streaming subscriber numbers. The company ended its last quarter with 132 million Disney+ subscribers, and 196 million Disney+ and Hulu subscribers, with revenue growth this quarter suggestive of further adds, perhaps paired with higher prices.

	











	On the call, Iger outlined how the company's deal with OpenAI for Sora-generated videos will work.


	“We have for a while wanted to include or add a feature on Disney+, as ESPN did, by the way, in its new offering, that is both user generated, but more importantly, short form,” Iger said. “ESPN is short form, because we have obviously noticed the huge growth in short form and user generated content on other platforms such as such as YouTube. So what this deal does is by giving us the ability to curate what has been basically created by Sora onto Disney+, it jumpstarts our ability to have short form video on Disney+, additionally, it's our hope that we will use the Sora tools to enable subscribers of Disney+ to create short form videos on our platform through Sora, so it's all, I think, a positive step in terms of adding a feature that we believe will greatly enhance engagement.”


	Experiences revenues cracked $10 billion, with operating income of $3.3 billion, as guests spent more and with Disney's cruise ships operating at a higher capacity.


	In sports, revenues were $4.9 billion, with operating income of $191 million.


	According to Disney's 10-Q, the company closed its deal for the NFL to acquire a 10 percent stake in ESPN in January, a deal that carries an estimated fair value of $3 billion, per the company. Disney also disclosed that it has the right to buy back the NFL's stake beginning in July 2034, “in exchange for a ten-year note at 70 percent of the then fair market value of the NFL's interest in ESPN,” while the league has an option to acquire an additional 4 percent of ESPN at 70 percent of fair market value.

	











	That said, there were also some cracks showing. The extended YouTube TV blackout of Disney's channels, most notably ABC and ESPN, had an adverse impact on operating income of $110 million, and was reflected in the sports division, which saw operating income decline 23 percent compared to last year.


	And while the company reaffirmed its guidance, it warned of higher costs at experiences due to new attractions and cruise ships, as well as “international visitation headwinds at our domestic parks.”


	In entertainment, the company projects segment operating income in its fiscal Q2 to be comparable to a year ago, while streaming income is expected to rise to $500 million. For the year, the company projects double digit operating income growth in the segment, weighted to the second half, and streaming margins of 10 percent.


	Sports is expected to have low single digit operating income growth for the year, with a slight decline in Q2 due to higher expenses.


	And while experiences is expected to have modest operating income growth in fiscal Q2, the company still projects high single digit growth, weighted toward the back half of the year.


	On the call, Iger was bullish about the division's long-term potential, noting that when he was first promoted, it was struggling somewhat.


	“As we added IP to our stable, including Pixar in '06 and Marvel in '09 and Lucasfilm, Star Wars in '12, and ultimately 20th Century Fox, we gained access to intellectual property that had real value in terms of parks and resorts and enabled us to lean into more capital spending because of the confidence level we had in improving returns on invested capital due to the popularity of that IP,” Iger said. “When you look at the footprint of the business today, it's never been more broad or more diverse, and the projects that we have underway are going to make it even more so. As I said, we're expanding in every place we operate, and additionally, having been in Abu Dhabi just two weeks ago, I was reminded how great the potential is to build in that part of the world is not only is it strategically located to reach a huge population that has never visited our parks, but we built in one of the most modern and technologically advanced ways. So you know, as I look ahead, I actually am very, very bullish on that business and its ability to grow.”

	“That's a Grammy that every artist wants — almost as much as Trump wants Greenland,” Noah joked as Billie Eilish was announced as the winner for Song of the Year. “Which makes sense because, since Epstein's gone, he needs a new island to hang out with Bill Clinton. I told you, it's my last year! What are you going to do about it?”

	In a lengthy post shared on Truth Social late Sunday, Trump criticized the Grammys, the broadcast network CBS, and Noah, after the comedian made a remark referencing Trump and Bill Clinton in connection with Jeffrey Epstein.


	“The Grammy Awards are the WORST, virtually unwatchable!” Trump wrote. “CBS is lucky not to have this garbage litter their airwaves any longer.”


	Trump went on to dispute Noah's comment directly, writing: “Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!! I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory statement, have never been accused of being there, not even by the Fake News Media.”

	











	The president continued his criticism of Noah's hosting, adding: “The host, Trevor Noah, whoever he may be, is almost as bad as Jimmy Kimmel at the Low Ratings Academy Awards… Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast.”


	Trump also suggested potential legal action, writing that he would be “sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C., and suing him for plenty$,” before concluding: “Get ready Noah, I'm going to have some fun with you!”


	Neither the Recording Academy nor representatives for Noah have publicly responded to Trump's remarks at the time of publication.


	The Grammys, which aired Sunday night, were hosted by Noah for the sixth consecutive year, with the comedian continuing his tradition of opening monologues that referenced politics, pop culture, and current events.

Alex Warren has addressed technical difficulties that affected his performance at the Grammy Awards on Sunday night.


	The singer-songwriter, who was nominated for Best New Artist, experienced apparent in-ear monitor issues during his televised performance of “Ordinary,” which was broadcast live from Los Angeles. Viewers noted audio irregularities as Warren appeared to struggle with his earpiece while performing.


	Following the ceremony, Warren responded on Instagram, sharing a video that demonstrated what he said he was hearing during the performance. “When you're performing at the Grammys and all you hear is this in your ears,” he wrote, alongside distorted and delayed audio from the track. He added in a separate caption, “This would only happen to me…”

	During the performance, Warren was seen adjusting his in-ear pack and eventually removing one of the monitors, while briefly falling out of sync with the backing track. The nature of the technical malfunction has not been formally addressed by the Recording Academy or broadcast partner CBS.

	











	Despite the setback, the appearance marked Warren's first on-stage performance at the Grammys. He was nominated for Best New Artist following a breakout year that included the success of “Ordinary.”




	The award ultimately went to Olivia Dean, who capped off a year that included major festival appearances and the release of her album The Art of Loving.


	As of publication, representatives for Warren and the Recording Academy have not issued further comment regarding the technical issues.

	Full trailer for Lionsgate's Michael Jackson biopic Michael is here as we approach April 24 release date.


	“You are confident. You are strong. You are beautiful. You are the greatest of all time,” the trailer begins as we see the King of Pop elevate from nothing to something overlaid with a soundtrack featuring several of his catchiest tunes.


	The movie stars Jackson's nephew Jaafar Jackson in the titular role. He can be seen singing, dancing and being elevated to superstardom through the two minute 16 second trailer.


Antoine Fuqua‘s Michael also stars Miles Teller as Jackson's attorney and adviser John Branca, Colman Domingo as his father Joe Jackson, Nia Long as his mother Katherine Jackson, Jessica Sula as his sister LaToya Jackson, Larenz Tate as Motown Records founder Berry Gordy, Laura Harrier as pioneering music executive Suzanne de Passe, Kat Graham as Diana Ross and Juliano Valdi as Jackson 5-era Michael Jackson.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The biopic is set to be released in theaters on April 24. There has been plenty of speculation about its release and delays. It's still not clear from the synopsis or trailer whether the film will touch on any of the controversies that met the superstar later in life. The trailer drops two days before a UK documentary that will air previously unheard audio recordings from Jackson discussing his feelings towards children.


	The synopsis reads: Michael tells the story of Michael Jackson's life beyond the music, tracing his journey from the discovery of his extraordinary talent as the lead of the Jackson Five, to the visionary artist whose creative ambition fueled a relentless pursuit to become the biggest entertainer in the world. Highlighting both his life off-stage and some of the most iconic performances from his early solo career, the film gives audiences a front-row seat to Michael Jackson as never before. This is where his story begins.”

					By Dade Hayes 

Business Editor


Disney reported solid results for its fiscal first quarter but also disclosed a $110 million hit from an autumn carriage fight with YouTube TV.


	Revenue for the quarter ended December 27 ticked up 5% from the year-earlier period to reach $25.98 billion. Diluted earnings per share came in at $1.63, excluding non-recurring items. Wall Street analysts had expected revenue of $25.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.58.


	The numbers were released before the start of Monday's trading day, a window seldom used by media companies to report quarterly earnings. Investors (and Hollywood) are eagerly awaiting a bigger piece of news: the naming of CEO Bob Iger's successor. The Disney board is convening its quarterly meeting this week and is expected to settle on its pick, with Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney's Experiences division, now the betting favorite.

	The Sports division posted operating income of $191 million, down 23% from the year-ago period. The company blamed higher programming and production costs, along with a decrease in subscription and affiliate fees, with those negatives wiping out a 10% rise in ad revenue. The YouTube TV battle, which was resolved in mid-November after a 15-day period when ESPN, ABC and other networks were taken off the leading pay-TV service in the middle of the football season, delivered a $110 million blow to operating income.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Experiences, which includes theme parks, resorts and cruise ships, hit $10 billion in revenue for the first time, with operating income of $3.3 billion. Domestic parks attendance inched up 1% and per-capita spending increased 4% in the period.

	











	In the current quarter, Disney cautioned, income growth in Experiences will be “modest” due to “international visitation headwinds at our domestic parks.” While the company didn't call out the issue specifically, President Trump's tariffs have suppressed tourist visits to the U.S. from a number of countries.


	Entertainment revenue climbed 7% to $11.6 billion, but the number of theatrical releases increased costs, contributing to a 35% drop in operating income in the unit. 


	As the company had signaled before earnings, the quarter included the release of Zootopia 2, Avatar: Fire and Ash, Predator: Badlands and Tron: Ares , compared with just two releases in the prior-year quarter (Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King). That boosted expenses, but the billion-dollar-plus box office for the Zootopia and Avatar sequels will bring benefits in future quarters. 


	Entertainment SVOD operating income, powered by Disney+ and Hulu, soared to $450 million, well ahead of internal projections. Management is projecting it will hit $500 million in the current quarter. Price increases phased in during the October-to-December quarter provided a boost to the streaming results but visibility on growth is limited. Disney, following in Netflix's footsteps, has stopped reporting subscriber numbers on a quarterly basis, and also no longer discloses the widely tracked metric of average revenue per user.


	Iger nodded to his second stint as CEO, which began in November 2022, in the earnings release. (The first one lasted from 2005 to 2020.) “As we continue to manage our company for the future, I am incredibly proud of all that we've accomplished over the past three years,” he said.

Disney sports took a hit because sports fans like myself are tired of ESPN political commentators – if I want to listen to politics there are other channels for that.

Co-Business Editor


Disney CEO Bob Iger spoke at length on the prospects of parks and entertainment as they vie for top billing at the company in terms of growth, telling investors on a call after earnings that “we have a healthy competition now in our company in terms of which of those two businesses is going to essentially prevail as the number one driver of profitability.”


	“But I'm confident that both have that ability. Meaning both have the ability to grow nicely into the future, given all the investments that we've made and the trajectory that we're on,” he said.


	The comments, in response to a question asking him to asses the two core businesses come as the board could announce Iger's replacement as CEO as soon as this week. Parks & Experiences chief Josh D'Amaro is reportedly in pole position. Dana Walden, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, has also been considered a front runner.

	“f you go all the way back to 2005, when I became CEO, the return on invested capital in the theme parks and resorts business was not impressive, and actually not acceptable. And we also had not that much building in progress, meaning there wasn't much expansion — but maybe for good reason, because the return of invested capital was so low,” Iger said. “As we added IP to our stable, including Pixar in '06 and Marvel in '09, and LucasFilm in 2012, and ultimately 20th Century Fox, we gained access to intellectual property that had real value in terms of parks and resorts, and enabled us to lean into more capital spending because of the confidence level we had in improving returns on invested capital due to the popularity of that IP,” Iger said.

	The trajectory of streaming looks strong, as does film, with post post strong results for Disney's fiscal first quarter ended in September. “We know that's in the pipeline,” he said. “Looking back just a few years, our movie business was suffering from Covid, and the streaming business was obviously not an acceptable place.” Now, he said, the future of both Entertainment and Parks “are bright.”


	Disney reported just under $24.7 billion in revenue and just over $5 billion in operating profit last quarter. Parks & Experiences accounted for about 40% of the former (or$9.4 billion) and 60% of the latter (or $3.11 billion).

She's “sour candy.”

Miley Cyrus snubbed Lady Gaga after the latter snagged the award for best vocal album during Sunday's 2026 Grammys.

The “Flowers” hitmaker, 31, notably failed to stand up or even clap when Gaga, 39, got on stage to accept her award for “Mayhem.”

The “Hannah Montana” star, who rocked a black leather jacket and matching pants, remained seated during Gaga's big moment, unlike their fellow nominees, including Sabrina Carpenter.

Reps for Cyrus and Gaga did not immediately return Page Six's request for comment.

Fans on social media immediately noticed the snub, with one person writing via X, “Miley shading Andrew Watt not Gaga I'm actually obsessed by it.”

Meanwhile, another chimed in, saying, “Miley's face during lady gaga winning? EXCUSE ME ?!”, as another said, “Now I need an explanation on why Miley sat for Gaga….”

“THE SHADE MILEY NOT STANDING UP FOR GAGA WHATS GOING ON AND WHY IS WATT PROBABLY THE REASON,” a fourth person wrote.

However, others defended Cyrus, noting that her rift is with Gaga's producer, Andrew Watt, with whom she collaborated on “Plastic Hearts” in 2020.

“Miley was never going to stand up when Watt was on the stage, it had nothing to do with Gaga,” a netizen wrote, noting their ongoing feud. “Please learn your history before speaking on her.”

While it's unclear exactly why Cyrus and Watt are seemingly feuding, fan speculation centered around rumors that the pair had a brief relationship while making “Plastic Hearts.”

In a 2020 interview, however, the producer gushed over the Disney Channel alum. 

“I have known Miley [Cyrus] for a long time, and I've known her work and paid really close attention to all the stuff she was doing because I was such a fan,” he told “Entertainment Weekly” at the time.

“When she and her team came to me saying that she wanted to lean into her rock vibes a bit more, it was a dream.” 

Watt continued, saying that Cyrus is an “artist who, without a doubt, always knows what she wants to do.”

“You're on Miley's ride when you're there,” he continued. “And she connects to her lyrics so hard. The music of ‘Plastic Hearts' was within the first three things I made for Miley. And I believe it was the second song we ended up writing for the album.”

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's wife, Sarah Ferguson, made a crude comment about their daughter Princess Eugenie in an email to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

On Friday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released millions of files related to its criminal investigations into the late child sex offender.

In one email, Ferguson — formerly Sarah, Duchess of York — was contacted by Epstein in March 2010, two years after he was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute.

“ny [New York]?” Epstein wrote the mom of two, to which she replied, “Not sure yet. Just waiting for Eugenie to come back from a shagging weekend!!” (Shagging is a British slang term for sexual intercourse.)

Eugenie, now 35, was two days away from turning 20 when the emails between her mom and Epstein were exchanged. Per the Mirror, the princess brought in her big day with her then-boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank. (Eugenie and Brooksbank tied the knot in 2018.)

Ferguson also shares daughter Princess Beatrice, 37, with Andrew, 65, who was stripped of his royal titles last October due to his ties to pedophile Epstein.

“His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew,” Buckingham Palace told Page Six in a statement at the time.

“His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.”

The statement continued, “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.

“Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”

Andrew was accused of sexual abuse by Virginia Giuffre, who recently died by suicide.

Meanwhile, Ferguson also faced consequences for her ties to Epstein.

Last September, Julia's House, a children's hospice charity, cut ties with the British author after her emailed apology to the child rapist leaked.

The Daily Mail revealed at the time that Ferguson reached out to Epstein in April 2011 to “humbly apologize” for calling their friendship a “gigantic error of judgment” in an Evening Standard interview.

 “I know you feel hellaciously let down by me from what you were either told or read,” she wrote to Epstein.

The Biebers are bringing their swag to the red carpet. 

Justin Bieber back made a triumphant return to the awards show circuit, hitting the Grammys 2026 red carpet with wife Hailey Bieber.

The pop star, 31, opted for an oversized black Balenciaga suit paired with a dazzling diamond tennis necklace by Lorraine Schwartz featuring 100 carats of diamonds.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Bieber coordinated with her husband in a strapless black Alaïa dress featuring large sheer panels on her legs.

The model accessorized with massive diamonds, too, including a silver collar necklace with a 30-carat pear-shaped diamond, matching 20-carat earrings and a 12-carat ring — all also by Schwartz.

The couple also made a statement with their accessories, wearing anti-ICE pins reading “ICE OUT.” (They're not the only stars sporting political pins for the award show, as many others including Kehlani wore the same button on the red carpet, in addition to boldly condemning Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in an interview.)

Bieber is anticipated to have a big night as he's nominated for four awards — including album of the year for “Swag,” up against Lady Gaga, Bad Bunny, Kendrick Lamar, Sabrina Carpenter and more.

He's also set to take the stage for his first major performance in four years.

The couple last appeared at the Grammys in 2022, when the “Yummy” singer turned up in a pink beanie with his suit while the Rhode founder chose a slinky Saint Laurent slip dress.

It's sure to be a big year for Bieber, who is set to headline Coachella in April alongside Sabrina Carpenter, Karol G and Anyma.

While the Biebers have had marriage struggles in recent times — which Justin sings about on his albums “Swag” and “Swag II” in songs like “Daisies” and “Walking Away” — sources say Hailey was the “driving force” behind his decision to perform at the music festival.

The “incredibly supportive” model, 29, reportedly “assured” her husband that “now is the best time” to take the stage again.

We're sure she'll be hyping him up during his performance, too.

Bad Bunny conquered the Grammys last night and is on track to conquer the Super Bowl halftime show stage this coming weekend, so the knights of Westeros and the financial bandits of London have already laid down their swords. HBO has confirmed that instead of trying to compete directly with the Super Bowl, its two major Sunday evening series, Industry and A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms, will become available a little bit early via HBO Max. 

While both episodes will still air linearly on Sunday evening in their regular time slots, the fifth episode of Industry‘s current season and the fourth episode of A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms will debut on HBO Max on Friday, February 6 at 3:01 am ET/12:01 am PT. Adjust your watch parties accordingly! 

HBO pulled a similar move in 2024, sharing that year's episode of True Detective: Night Country on Friday night so people wouldn't have to choose between watching a corpsicle thaw and footage of Taylor Swift and Ice Spice watching the Chiefs best the 49ers. Beside Bad Bunny, the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks will also be at this year's Super Bowl, a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 that presumably won't include Left Shark this time. Kickoff for that is at 6:30 ET.

Longtime Hallmark star Marcus Rosner just landed his biggest role yet: DAD! On February 1, 2026, the Canadian actor and producer announced the surprise news via social media with his wife, Ali Kroeker, thrilling fans and colleagues. 

Sharing a precious black and white photo of their baby boy grasping onto each of their thumbs, Rosner wrote, “Our Boy. M.R.R. January, 2026”

Rosner, who joined the cast of “Sullivan's Crossing” in 2025, has been married to Kroeker, an independent filmmaker, for four years. 

“The Love Club” star, 36, shared their baby announcement in his Instagram Stories and sweetly wrote, “Welcome, my boy. All I know right now is you will never wonder where I am. The rest we'll figure out as we go.”

The photo Rosner and Kroeker shared reveals a tattoo on his hand that says “Be Here Now.” Several months before his son's birth, in October, he shared in a social media video that he'd been reflecting on wanting to be more intentional about telling stories that matter to him, like the fact he was “born to a 15-year-old mother” and didn't grow up with “soft problems” like many of his characters have had. 

Noting that he's been “very fortunate” to appear in many TV shows and movies, Rosner said, “Recently, something's just been growing in me where I have this feeling that I haven't really used this craft to tell my stories — the ones that shaped me, the ones that might make me feel understood. And for years, I was caught in this cycle of just making the next thing, projects that come and go, and experiences flying by at the speed of light.” 

Rosner continued, “It was thrilling, and I was addicted to that cycle, and I was grateful for it, but lately I've been slowing down and taking the time to make things that might actually last, even if they only matter to me.”

The surprise baby news thrilled Rosner's famous friends, including Erin Krakow, whom he's known since playing Charles Kensington on “When Calls The Heart” in 2015. Krakow, who's expecting her own bundle of joy with fellow WCTH star Ben Rosenbaum, commented on Rosner's post, “Look at this precious soul! Congratulations!!!”

Rosner's close friend and “The Love Club” co-star Brittany Bristow chimed in, “Friggen perfect little man. ❤️” and “The Christmas Baby” director Eva Tavares exclaimed, “WHATTTTT AHHHHHH CONGRATS❤️❤️❤️❤️”

“Hope Valley: 1874” star Chelsea Hobbs wrote, “OMG Whaaaaaaaat 🙌❤️ 😭 congrats you two!!!!”

Hallmark alum Cindy Busby, who co-starred with Rosner in the 2019 Lifetime thriller “The Killer Downstairs,” wrote, “Awwww!!! What a lucky lil guy!!! Congratulations 🥳 👏😍❤️”

Young actress Skywalker Hughes, who filmed the yet-to-be-released “Uphill for Christmas” with Rosner, commented, “Ahhhhh yes!!!!!! Huge congratulations 🥳 ❤️ you'll be an amazing dad MARCUS I know!!! signed, your tv daughter!!!! Ahhhh 🙌🙌🙌 so exciitngnnnnnnnn”

Fans flooded Rosner and Kroeker's post with words of congratulations, too, thrilled by their surprise baby news. 

Congratulations Marcus & Ali On The Birth Of Your Precious Baby Boy! I Am So Happy & Excited For You Both! I Hope Mommy & Baby Are Both Doing Well. You Are In For The Absolute Best “Ride” Of Your Lives! Wishing You ALL Much Happiness & Love, Good Health, Fun & Laughter, Many Blessings And Special Moments! All The Best! Sending Love & Hugs. Chris V. 💙🎉🎈🍾👣

Parthenon Huxley was a musician celebrated for his solo work and collaborations with other artists, including Mark Oliver Everett of the alternative rock band Eels and ELO II. The tragic news of Huxley's passing was announced by his heartbroken wife in a Facebook post. Tributes have poured in, highlighting just how loved he was.

Huxley died in his sleep on January 30. He was 70 years old. His wife, Helle Huxley, shared a short statement on his official Facebook page. “This is Parthenon's wife, Helle Huxley,” she wrote. “I'm so sad to share the heartbreaking news that Parthenon passed away peacefully in his sleep early this morning.” She also shared a link to his obituary on Interfaith Funerals. 

On the funeral page, more details about Huxley's life have been shared. This includes his first single, “Buddha, Buddha, Buddha,” released in 1983, and his status as a staff songwriter for MCA Music Publishing. But there was also more information about his personal life. 

“Parthenon will be remembered by those who loved him for his absolutely brilliant sense of humor, his unconditional love for his friends and family, and his deep connection to his formative years living in Greece,” the tribute reads. “Beyond his original music, which was equal parts emotionally devastating and infectiously catchy, his ability to write a parody song was unparalleled. If you were lucky enough to be the subject of one, you knew you were loved by him deeply.” 

Huxley was cherished and had a loving family. He is survived by his wife, Helle; his daughters, Fiona and Imogen; his mother, Phyllis; and his older brothers, Tom, Tim, and Chuck. He also had two beloved pet cats, Theo and Frankie. 

The tribute shares a beautiful final wish. “In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be sent in Parthenon's name to the Sitar Arts Center, which provides affordable, high-quality arts education and workforce development in the visual, digital, and performing arts,” the tribute reads. “Each semester, 80% of students are from DC households at 60% or less of the area's median income.” 

Fans have reacted to the Facebook post, sharing heartfelt tributes. Many have written about knowing or meeting Huxley and the impact he had on their lives. “Dear Helle, I am so shocked and so sorry about Parthenon's passing, which to me came totally unexpected,” a comment reads. “I was in contact with him over many years and even had a chance to interview him for an interview special a while ago. As my tribute to Parthenon, I will re-air this special the week after next. My prayers are with you.”

Another fan shared their condolences, writing, “My heartfelt condolences to you, Helle, and to Fiona and Imogen. Parthenon's light, wit, and quiet generosity touched so many lives. And my heart is with your family during this profound loss. May his memory truly be eternal.”

Ifunanya Nwangene, whose singing career was launched after she appeared on “The Voice Nigeria” season 3, has passed away after she was bitten by a snake, People reports. She was 26 years old.

According to BBC Africa, Nwangene died on Saturday, Jan. 31, in Abuja, Nigeria. The outlet  reported that social media videos surfaced of a snake handler removing a snake from her apartment. In the background, someone could be heard screaming, “It is a cobra!”

Hillary Obinna, a friend of the rising artist, informed the BBC that Nwangene was asleep when “the snake bite woke her up.” Obinna shared that when the snake handler searched the singer's apartment, two of them were found.

Obinna added that “everybody is shattered” about the artist's death, noting that she was “a very wonderful girl; she is humble – very intelligent and very talented.”

Sam Ezugwu, the co-founder and music director of the Amemuso Choir, where Nwangene sang, told the BBC that he rushed to the Federal Medical Centre after hearing the singer had taken herself there.

He described Nwangene's condition, saying, “While they were trying to stabilize her, she could not speak, but she could make hand gestures. She was struggling to breathe.”

Ezugwu later confirmed Nwangene's death in a heartfelt Facebook post on Sunday, Feb. 1. He referred to his friend as a “rising star” who was “on the cusp of sharing her incredible talent with the world,” adding that “her voice and spirit will be deeply missed.”

Nwangene's appearance on “The Voice Nigeria” in 2021 highlighted her talents with jazz, opera, classical music and soul.

During the blind auditions, the songstress showcased her musical skills by singing “Take a Bow” by Rihanna, ultimately turning two chairs at the very last minute.

Brother of Nwangene, Emy Kaybaba, expressed his immense grief on his Instagram Story following his sister's death. He wrote that the singer brought herself to the hospital “without any help,” adding that she “fought till the end.”

In a repost of screenshots from Kaybaba's Instagram Story, supporters poured in their condolences for the heartbreaking story.

“This broke me! 😭😭😭,” commented one.

“This is painful,” said another.

“God please!!! Ah! 💔,” said a third.

Nwangene will be remembered not only for her remarkable singing voice but also for her incredible bravery and strength.



Such a tragedy. How did the snakes get into her bedroom? Where did they come from?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Garth Brooks Mourns Someone Close to Him with Thoughtful Statement","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/garth-brooks-mourns-friend-nancy-seltzer/","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:21:28 GMT","

Country singer Garth Brooks has publicly mourned the loss of his publicist, Nancy Seltzer, whom he cared for. 

Brooks honored Seltzer with a lengthy post on his official website. Titled “​​Nancy Seltzer Has Passed — Quiet Hollywood Giant Leaves Legacy of Integrity and Class,” the post features a photo of Seltzer and a comment about who she was and what she did. 

“Public relations legend Nancy Seltzer passed away after a brief hospital stay this week, leaving behind a legacy that shaped decades of entertainment history — often quietly, always with integrity, dogged determination, and purpose,” the statement reads. 

The statement commented on Seltzer's career and celebrity clients, who included Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Robert Downey Jr., and Whitney Houston. “She worked at the highest levels of Hollywood, even running the Academy Awards red carpet for many years,” the statement reads. “She navigated moments of triumph and vulnerability with a steady hand and unwavering discretion.” 

Although much of Seltzer's work was behind the scenes, she was hugely beneficial to her clients. She always had their best interests at heart. “She wore publicist black like a uniform and kept the focus exactly where she believed it belonged: on her clients,” the statement reads. “Her integrity was contagious, her protective instincts were legendary — maternal, fierce, and unflinching. Her wisdom, earned through decades of experience, was unmatched. Those who worked alongside her understood the gravitas that she carried — and the grace with which she carried it.”

The statement also includes a message from Brooks. “Public relations is the hardest job in show business,” he said. “She always handled every situation with the utmost class.” It is unclear how much of the message on his website he wrote. However, it is clear that Seltzer meant enough to him to share the news of her passing with a message that is an undeniable celebration of her life and her career. 

The statement ends with a powerful message: “In an industry built on visibility, Nancy Seltzer chose discretion. In a business driven by ego, she led with loyalty. And in moments that demanded strength, she offered calm. Her absence will be deeply felt — not only for what she did, but for how she did it.”

Seltzer died on Wednesday, January 28, in Los Angeles, Variety reports. She was 79. Her firm shared a touching statement about her integrity as a publicist. “Ms. Seltzer was particularly known for her extraordinary trust. She created long lasting friendships with people from all over the world to whom she was also wonderful, kind, caring and fiercely loyal,” they shared.

When it comes to “The Devil Wears Prada,” Miranda Priestley's opinion is the only one that matters — but longtime fans of director David Frankel and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna's 2006 workplace comedy can rest easy after a promising first look debuted the night of the Grammys. From 20th Century Studios, the upcoming sequel reunites the original storytelling duo with star Meryl Streep, who once again plays the titular fashion editor, Miranda Priestley, who notoriously rules Runway Magazine with a pursed lip.

Rather than escalating Miranda's cool-toned aggression or sharpening her corporate knives, the trailer for “The Devil Wears Prada 2” hints at a dramatic solution that's more elegant and unexpected. Here, Miranda is a woman so powerful she scarcely remembers the events of the first film. When Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) re-enters the sleek offices at Runway, she's not a lost cause or an embittered rival; she's a stranger forced to introduce herself all over again — albeit in better shoes and with no cerulean.

Miranda's offer of employment, positioning Andy as a features editor at the magazine, lands less like an olive branch than a reminder of her former (and maybe future) boss' scale. Andy's life-altering professional ordeal with Miranda registers as little more than a footnote for her. That protective barrier has only strengthened with time, and the returning ensemble subtly reframes her and Andy's imbalance.

 










Ever the loyal steward for Runway's soul, Nigel (Stanley Tucci) is back as Miranda's right flank, while Emily (Emily Blunt) appears more detached from the magazine than ever — offering fleeting glimpses of a broader ecosystem that expands on Miranda's immediate orbit. The effect is clarifying, reminding viewers that Andy was always small potatoes for people who make contemporary culture as we know it.

Is this reunion the prelude to a long-simmering revenge arc, or as it appears here, an unexpected second chapter shaped by time and selective memory? Frankel and McKenna wisely refuse to show their hand, and instead, the teaser leans on nostalgic atmosphere — echoing the original score with another reworked version of Madonna's “Vogue,” and a knowing confidence that already signaled the first movie as an enduring cinematic favorite.

Notably, the trailer keeps its new cast, including Kenneth Branagh, Simone Ashley, Justin Theroux, Lucy Liu, Patrick Brammall, Caleb Hearon, Helen J. Shen, Pauline Chalamet, B.J. Novak, and Conrad Ricamora, largely in the shadows. It does, however, loudly laud the Academy Award wins and nominations of its four returning stars. It's a savvy acknowledgment of just how much talent is concentrated in this fictional corner of Manhattan and a warm invitation to revisit its world with fresh eyes. 

 










But what became of Nate? And what happened to Andy's friends? Is Christian Thompson still skulking around? Some loose threads are best saved for opening weekend. Watch the trailer for “Devil Wears Prada 2,” in theaters from 20th Century Studios on May 1.

For 18 years, Ben Cook has been making head-over-heels pop songs under a handful of similar names: Young Governor, Young Guv and the Scuzz, Young Guv. The project, recently rechristened as GUV, has outlasted Cook's time playing guitar on Fucked Up's punk operas and his stint as the frontman of Toronto hardcore band No Warning. But where other pop formalists write from a narrow frame of reference—'60s sunshine pop, Nuggets, “Ticket to Ride”—Cook is a sonic mercenary, arriving at whatever genre he's into with hooks in hand. He has convincingly aped Dirty Mind-era Prince, plucky synth-pop, and the Byrds' country phase with jangling 12-string guitars, rich harmonies, and familiar, relentless melodies.

Cook visited London in 2024, drinking in pubs and ambling around on Gray's Inn Road, not far from where he grew up in Brixton. The trip helped inspire his latest album, Warmer Than Gold, a swing at the “baggy Manchester opioid chic” he dabbled with on GUV IV's bedroom experiments in 2022. His latest is a thick slab of massive Britpop. But there are simply fewer earworms than we've come to expect. Without the hooks, Cook's tales of cosmopolitan life, romance, and dislocation can become tiring. He's searching for love again, he's found the one, he's struggling to pull away, he's traveling across the world; rinse, repeat.

With production from his No Warning bandmate James Matthew Seven, Cook puts together a lush palette of early shoegaze and Madchester-adjacent hallmarks for Warmer Than Gold. Flanged-out acoustic guitars and harmonies from Hatchie help “Never Should Have Said” conjure early dream-pop, “Thorns in My Heart” brazenly cribs from the Cure, and “Crash Down Feeling” is the closest GUV gets to the dance-inflected grooves of Primal Scream. Tubthumping drum machines appear at various points, providing a shot in the arm for the otherwise drowsy “Blue Jade.”

GUV has always prioritized style over substance, and the swaggering atmosphere makes sense for an artist who currently has a framed Oasis poster on his otherwise blank walls. His voice, deadpan and sneering, fits nicely atop the imposing, anthemic “Let Your Hands Go,” while the Auto-Tune all over “Hello Miss Blue” underlines Cook's dazed, wandering affect. But the more earnest Cook's songwriting gets, the more difficulty he has selling his lines. On “Seaside Story,” which is built around misty, clean electric guitars, he practically sounds bored with himself.

As far back as the earliest Young Governor singles, Cook's lyrics have lacked specificity, although it's rarely been a problem when paired with his instinct for snappy melodies. His pet subject has always been romantic exploits, but even the worst of his lyrical clichés were paired with surprising modulations, call-and-response harmonies, or alluring pop tricks. On Warmer Than Gold, he invokes colors as an emotional shortcut, mentioning “neon glow” and “hundred shades of blues” on “Out of This Place.” But the melodies aren't strong enough to excuse Cook's drab language. When he sings, “I must be crazy to be chasin' love again,” you're likely to agree.

Warmer Than Gold hits its stride when Cook struts his stuff, leaning into influences from the '90s dance floor. With jutting synths and a drum'n'bass beat, “Oscillating” is the right kind of ridiculous, while the similar “Hello Miss Blue” accrues momentum as Cook details how the girl of his dreams is losing her London groove. GUV excels at crafting mood music for walking around the city, feeling confident and delusional. “Want it/Get on it/See it comin',” he commands in “Let Your Hands Go,” and with these words of affirmation, he earns the right to wear those Liam Gallagher sunglasses.

The Soft Pink Truth began as a lark and a provocation—an invitation to cut rugs and undercut binaries in one fell swoop. Drew Daniel's debut album under the alias, 2003's Do You Party?, operated on multiple levels: A rejoinder to the (straight, white) seriousness of the experimental dance scene, it slipped funk, rap, and disco into a subversive take on glitch-techno aesthetics. The following year, the more expressly conceptual Do You Want New Wave or Do You Want the Soft Pink Truth? reimagined punk classics from groups like Crass, Minor Threat, and Angry Samoans as insouciant electro-pop bangers, erasing the divide between Daniel's hardcore youth and his electronic adulthood while queering the punk-rock canon. A decade later, Why Do the Heathen Rage? took similar liberties with black metal, gleefully torching underground music's ultimate temple to genre purism.

But the project has taken on a distinctly utopian tenor in the 2020s. The music has gotten deeper and sweeter; jokey gambits and herky-jerky sounds have fallen away, replaced by a rapturous fusion of deep house and ambient. You can trace the influence of artists like Moodymann, Matthew Herbert, and DJ Sprinkles, but Soft Pink Truth's last two albums—2020's Shall We Go On Sinning So That Grace May Increase? and 2022's Is It Going to Get Any Deeper Than This?—are also awash in chamber music, spiritual jazz, free improv, and classical minimalism. A spirit of collective reverence prevails. Both albums feel like illuminated manuscripts advancing the simplest argument ever made: A better world is possible.

A doubtful undertone creeps into his new album, Can Such Delightful Times Go On Forever? The record might be considered the third in a trilogy exploring the importance of community, collectivism, and solidarity, in both joy and defiance. Sinning was expressly framed as a response to Donald Trump's first term as president, a kind of “We Shall Overcome” rooted in the chosen family that Daniel and M.C. Schmidt, his husband and partner in the duo Matmos, have gathered around them over the past three decades. Deeper was more ecstatic, more sensuous. Like those albums, the new one favors human players over machines, but it goes a step further, largely abandoning overtly electronic tropes in favor of an acoustic palette informed by chamber music and film composition. More than merely a formal experiment, it feels like a political choice: a way of expressly centering people, and the relations between them, at a time when our rights and our autonomy are increasingly endangered by the predatory politics of AI.

It's a side of Daniel that we've rarely heard. “Mere Survival Is Not Enough” launches the album on an unabashedly sentimental note, romantic strings cresting in waves before falling away to reveal a plucky melody that would suit the opening credits of an HBO dramedy. The mood turns more contemplative with “And By and By a Cloud Takes All Away,” closer in spirit to the last two Soft Pink Truth records: Rolling piano chords and wordless vocals sketch out the drifting shapes of the title; pulsing saxophones nod to the American minimalist tradition; pitch-bent chords rise vertiginously, mirroring agile harp glissandi. The dimensions are always shifting, acoustic elements smeared into synthetic arrays and back again.

Daniel flexes his compositional chops on “Phrygian Ganymede,” a 10-minute epic in which limpid pools of harp and piano freeze and shatter, giving way to dissonant pizzicato sequences and dramatic bowing; the latter half is a freeform fantasia full of splotchy woodwinds and unsettling dissonance. It sounds like a tribute to the sounds that Daniel absorbed in the art-house movie theater that his stepfather operated in Louisville, Kentucky.

Nearly two dozen players populate the credits, but it's not clear who does what on any given track; by design, the Soft Pink Truth's music subsumes individual voices into a tonal and textural union of broad, swirling shapes. But the emphasis on acoustic timbres also gives this album a more stripped-back feel than its predecessors. Your reaction to that clarity may be a question of taste; confronted with the jagged, almost aggressive string figures of “Time Inside the Violet,” I miss the enveloping nature of Daniel's last two albums, the feeling of floating through a particularly absorbing dream. But the new album does have plenty of buoyant moments—“Orchard,” featuring pastoral acoustic guitar from Bill Orcutt, is a particular highlight, approximating some of the starry-eyed sensory overload of Jim O'Rourke's Bad Timing and Eureka. And in any case, unalloyed pleasure doesn't seem to be the chief concern of this album. True to form for his day job as an academic, Daniel's default mode is to question and provoke. Can Such Delightful Times Go On Forever? feels like an attempt to break out of his comfort zone at a time when there are no easy answers.

	The wait is officially over: The biggest night in music is finally here! Tonight, the top names in the industry gathered for the 68th Grammy Awards.


	This year's competition is stiff, with Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga, and Bad Bunny leading the pack as nominees. All three will face off for Album of the Year, and Lamar will also compete for Song and Record of the Year. Gaga was also nominated in the three big categories — Album, Song, and Record of the Year — for Mayhem and “Abracadabra,” while Bad Bunny picked up his second Album of the Year nod, for DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, as well as his first nod as lead artist for Song and Record of the Year for “DtMF” (he was previously nominated in the latter category for “I Like It” with Cardi B and J Balvin).


	Sabrina Carpenter and Leon Thomas also picked up a handful of nominations, and both will compete in Album of the Year, too, for Man's Best Friend and Mutt, respectively. Other nominees in that category include Justin Bieber's Swag, Clipse's Let God Sort Em Out, and Tyler, the Creator's Chromakopia.

	Best New Artist is set to feature Olivia Dean, Katseye, the Marias, Addison Rae, Sombr, Thomas, Alex Warren, and Lola Young. (Of those nominees, only Katseye, Thomas, and Young received nominations in other Grammy categories.) 


	Trevor Noah, who has served as the MC for the ceremony five times before (including last year), returned to host the show that included performances by Carpenter, Bieber, Clipse, and Lady Gaga.

Steven Spielberg is now an EGOT.


	The legendary director-producer has joined Elton John, Viola Davis, Rita Morena, and about two dozen other artists in the esteemed ranks of people who've won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony. He snagged the rare status Sunday after winning a Grammy for his work as a producer on Music By John Williams, the documentary that won the Best Music Film category at the 68th Grammy Awards in downtown Los Angeles.


	Spielberg, 79, didn't take the stage to receive his award, but Laurent Bouzereau, the film's director, thanked him and fellow producer Ron Howard for helping “tell the story of one of our greatest music voices ever.” The film explores the life of Williams, 93, the composer who collaborated with Spielberg for decades, creating the music for E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the Indiana Jones series, Jurassic Park, and Schindler's List.


	Spielberg was lined up to grab EGOT standing after winning several Emmys and Oscars for projects including Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan, and his 2022 Tony Award for Best Musical for being a producer of A Strange Loop.

	After collaborating with Spielberg on 2022's The Fabelmans — which earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original  Score — Williams said he planned to retire. He later returned to score Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Speaking at an American Cinematheque event, he explained the decision was out of his hands in some respects.  

	











	“Steven is a lot of things. He's a director, he's a producer, he's a studio head, he's a writer, he's a philanthropist, he's an educator. One thing he isn't is a man you can say ‘no' to,” Williams said during the conversation. “Also, you can't ‘retire' from music. It's like breathing. It's your life. It's my life. A day without music is a mistake.”

	This year's 68th Grammy Awards marked the debut of a new category in the country music field: Best Contemporary Country Album. During Sunday night's ceremonies, Jelly Roll was named the first winner in the category for his album Beautifully Broken.


	After thanking his wife, Bunnie Xo — “I'd have killed myself if it wasn't for you and Jesus” — Jelly Roll recounted his time in prison, in a “6 by 8 foot cell,” and how those dire days informed Beautifully Broken. “There was a time in my life when I was broken. That's why I wrote this album,” he said onstage. “I was a horrible human.”


	Then the man born Jason DeFord went into the proselytizing that has become a signature of his concerts and onstage appearances. “I believed that music had the power to change my life and God had the power to change my life,” he shouted. “Jesus is for everybody. Jesus is not owned by one political party…. Jesus is Jesus. Anybody can have a relationship with him.”

	Jelly Roll faced off against fellow nominees Kelsea Ballerini (Patterns), Tyler Childers (Snipe Hunter), Eric Church (Evangeline vs. the Machine), and Miranda Lambert (Postcards From Texas). Earlier on Sunday, Jelly Roll won another Grammy, for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for “Amen” with Shaboozey. The “A Bar Star (Tipsy)” singer dedicated his Grammy to the “children of immigrants.” “This is also for those who came to this country in search of better opportunity to be a part of a nation that promised freedom for all and equal opportunity to everyone willing to work for it. Thank you for bringing your culture, your music, your stories, and your traditions here,” Shaboozey said. “You give America color.”

	The introduction of the Best Contemporary Country Album category was to help distinguish mainstream country from more traditional sounds, and came a year after Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter album earned her a win for Best Country Album in 2025.


	The nominees for Best Traditional Country Album included Margo Price (Hard Headed Woman), Charley Crockett (Dollar a Day), Willie Nelson (Oh What a Beautiful World), Lukas Nelson (American Romance), and the winner, Ain't in It for My Health, by Zach Top.

Bad Bunny took the stage at the 2026 Grammy Awards to accept the award for Best Música Urbana Album for his LP DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, but he wasn't interested in the glitz and glamour of the ceremony in that moment. He used the entirety of his speech to call out ICE raids and cruel anti-immigrant rhetoric. 


	“Before I say, ‘Thank God,' I'm going to say, ‘ICE out,'” Bad Bunny said. “We're not savage. We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.” 


	His speech came after host Trevor Noah approached the artist at his table earlier in the night and jokingly asked if Puerto Rico could serve as a refuge for Americans if things got bad in the country. Bad Bunny responded with a fairly deadpanned tone, reminding him that Puerto Rico is part of the U.S.

Bad Bunny condemns ICE during his #GRAMMYs speech for Best Música Urbana Album:“Before I say thanks to god, I'm going to say, ICE out. We're not savages, we're not animals, we are humans and we are Americans.” pic.twitter.com/lS9cZV5t5x


	Many artists showed up to the Grammys wearing “ICE Out” pins on the red carpet and praising immigrants in their acceptance speeches throughout the night. Their gestures served as a reminder of the violence and force both immigrants and U.S. citizens are facing at the hands of ICE.

	











	“I want to say to the people, I know it's tough not to hate these days,” Bad Bunny continued. “The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. So, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love. We don't hate them. We love our people, we love our family, and that's the way to do it — with love. Don't forget that, please.”

	In 1967, as the death count of American soldiers in Southeast Asia reached 20,000, Norman Mailer published a short, brilliant book called Why Are We in Vietnam? It was a work of fiction, not a political tract, and the plot itself had nothing to do with the war that was dominating American news and dinnertime debate. In fact, the word “Vietnam” did not appear — other than on the title page — until the very last paragraph of the novel.


Why Are We in Vietnam? is, instead, about a hunting trip on the northern edge of Alaska. The book's narrator is a crass Texas teenager named D.J. Jethroe, whose father, Rusty, is a swaggering, rapacious executive with something called Central Consolidated Combined Chemical and Plastic (“4C and P” for short). Rusty, a “high-grade asshole,” takes D.J. and his best friend, Tex, along on his quest to kill the scariest grizzly bear he can find, along with two of Rusty's ambitious corporate lackeys, whom D.J. refers to as “M.A.'s,” or “medium assholes.”

	











	Here's the Spark Notes version: Unsatisfied with smaller game like foxes and caribou, Rusty goads the reluctant tour guide into bringing the party up close with a snarling grizzly. D.J. shoots the bear first, felling him, but Rusty finishes him off as he lies bleeding and immediately steals credit for the kill. The sniveling M.A.s, of course, fall all over themselves to back up the boss.

	Disgusted by this charade and weary of all the macho bullshit, D.J. and Tex strike out alone and unarmed, come face to face with the naked beauty of the tundra, and repress an urge to sleep together. Instead, terrified by their feelings, the boys surrender to the violent, corporatist culture in which they've been raised, trudging back to camp with what they believe to be a mission from God: “Fulfill my will, go and kill.”

	











	Only on the book's final page do we learn that D.J. is telling us this story a few years later, at a dinner party held in his honor at the Jethroes' Dallas mansion. The next day, he and Tex, now 18, will be shipping off to war. And thus the book's final, chilling line: “Vietnam, hot damn.” (Let's be real, you weren't going to read it anyway.)

	At a time when Americans debated theories of what underlay a widening war (fear of falling dominoes, white paternalism, a thirst for tin and rubber), Mailer offered an explanation by way of a parable. Why were we in Vietnam? Because the country's ruling class — embodied by white, male Texans like Rusty Jethroe and Lyndon Johnson — had turned its rage and insecurity on the rest of the world.


	Mailer lays out a rapid-fire list of Rusty's 16 laments about chaotic 20th century America, starting with the clamoring for equal rights among housewives and minorities, and going on from there: “Africa is breaking loose. The adolescents are breaking loose.… The European nations hate America's guts. The products are no fucking good anymore.”


	And then, finally, there's a number 17: “He, Rusty, is fucked unless he gets that bear, for if he don't, white men are fucked more and they can take no more.… If he is less great than God intended him to be, then America is in Trouble.”


	 When I first read Why Are We in Vietnam? in college, I was blown away by Mailer's subversive sleight of hand — the idea that you could pose a serious question on the cover and then somehow answer it with a seemingly unrelated digression. But the novel, which earned a National Book Award nomination when it was published, has largely disappeared from the contemporary canon. 


	Maggie McKinley, a Mailer scholar who wrote the foreword to the most recent edition, told me that even she doesn't teach the book to her students at Harper College, in part because it's packed with racial and sexual language that would offend just about every modern sensibility. It's pretty much 200 pages of nonstop triggering.

	And yet, there's as much profundity in Why Are We in Vietnam? today as there was 60 years ago. If you really want to understand why Trump and his slavish acolytes, after essentially annexing Venezuela, are suddenly hell-bent on seizing the Arctic wilderness from a NATO ally (the hard way or the easy way, as they like to say), then you can ransack all the libraries in America, but I doubt you'll find a more relevant book.

	











	YOU CAN'T BLAME JOURNALISTS and academics for trying to ascribe a single, rational theory to the president's foreign policy. Generally speaking, we're used to sorting the chapters of American history in the world by philosophical constructs: “isolationism,” “containment,” “peace through strength,” and so on. We're not trained to treat “batshit crazy” as an actual worldview.


	And so analysts in Washington have been spinning their heads around like a bug-eyed Linda Blair in The Exorcist, trying to find some kind of familiar rubric to explain Trump's foreign policy. Is he an isolationist? (Last time I looked, isolationists didn't go around launching missiles on three different continents, so no.) Is he a converted neocon? (Trump would hand half of Ukraine to the Russians tomorrow, so if he's a neocon, I'm a Rastafarian.)


	Trump has been linked, at various times, to James Polk's “manifest destiny,” to Woodrow Wilson's “moral diplomacy,” to the “Monroe Doctrine” of the 19th century (which Trump calls the “Donroe Doctrine”). Basically, if somebody had an idea about foreign policy before the advent of air travel, chances are Trump has gotten credit for reviving it.


	The White House itself, in its official national security strategy, labeled its approach as “flexible realism” — a slogan so vapid and anodyne that I had to look it up four times before writing this sentence, because I kept mixing it up with other meaningless buzzwords, like “muscular” and “internationalism.” All it comes down to, really, is what Trump himself has said more plainly — that his own sense of morality is “the only thing that can stop me.” How's that for realism.


	Mailer, though, who was mostly known for glorifying a kind of American machismo in his work, would have had no trouble recognizing Trump's worldview for what it really is: manifest masculinity. 


	Trump's origin story is rooted in the same white, male insecurity that Rusty Jethroe personifies; it's possible he would never have run for president in the first place had the nation's first Black president not mocked him at a correspondents' dinner. (I don't think any of us in that ballroom, Barack Obama included,  understood then the depth of Trump's rage and racial grievance.) His last campaign was animated by a cultural backlash against “#MeToo” and “wokeness.” His decade of political dominance has coincided with the rise of what we call the “manosphere” — a chorus of angsty men who feel marginalized in society because they don't know how to skin animals and beat each other up.

	











	Why do we need Greenland? It's not because of rare-earth minerals or fast-thawing shipping lanes; these things are negotiable. It's not just because Trump always has to have his way with other world leaders, as others have noted. No, it's because the social forces that began to accelerate in Mailer's time have now reached critical mass. 


	In about 20 years, no matter how many ICE raids you carry out, America will be a majority-minority country, with all of us white men increasingly outnumbered. For Trump and his followers, this augurs the end of American dominance. The president sees his movement, rightly, as the last stand of a dying social order.


	And so Trump seeks domain over his own Arctic wilderness, accompanied by his own fawning band of M.A.'s — guys like J.D. Vance and Stephen Miller and Pete Hegseth. (Perhaps the “M” here stands for “major” rather than “medium.”) As Miller put it recently to Jake Tapper: “We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Pretty tough words from a guy who once painted hair onto his head for a TV hit.


	Greenland is Trump's feral grizzly, and it must be subdued. He needs it because it's the biggest damn iceberg on any grade-school map, and thus he must own and exploit it. He needs it because, having set out on this adventure, he can't now go back to his adoring fans at CPAC, trailed by his bobbleheaded M.A.'s, without being able to tell them how he bagged the place all by himself.

For decades, UFO sightings have hovered between belief and disbelief, fuelled by grainy footage and official silence. The debate was often dismissed as fringe, leaving the public with speculation rather than science.

Now, researchers say that era may finally be ending. A new push to detect and track Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAP, is promising something long missing from the debate: hard data.

Backed by cutting edge sensors, coordinated observers and public transparency, researchers say the so called 'UAP Trap' could finally prove what is really flying through Earth's airspace.

The renewed urgency comes as governments openly acknowledge that UAP are real but poorly understood. Military pilots have testified to Congress about objects that defy known technology, while defence agencies admit they often lose track of them the moment sensors lock on.

According to researchers involved in the UAP Detection and Tracking Summit, the problem has never been sightings. It has been verification. Without calibrated instruments and shared data, rumours fill the gaps. The summit brings together scientists, engineers and policy experts who argue that modern technology has finally caught up with the mystery.

High speed cameras, advanced radar, infrared imaging and acoustic sensors can now monitor the skies across multiple ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. When combined, these tools allow researchers to rule out aircraft, drones, weather events and sensor glitches. What remains, they say, is the real anomaly.

At the heart of the new approach is coordination. Instead of relying on a single camera or radar hit, teams are deploying networks of instruments that watch the same patch of sky at the same time.

Experts explain that one sensor alone can mislead. Radar can pick up distant aircraft. Infrared can be confused by heat reflections. Optical cameras can blur fast moving objects. But when all systems register the same event, the margin for error shrinks dramatically.

Some groups are already operating mobile labs fitted with night vision, thermal imaging and audio sensors that detect sounds beyond human hearing. Others are testing systems that capture thousands of frames per second, allowing scientists to study rapid acceleration and sudden direction changes in detail.

This layered detection model is what researchers call the 'UAP Trap'. It is designed to catch fleeting events that once slipped away unnoticed or unproven.

One striking feature of the new effort is how much it relies on civilians. Pilots, police officers and ordinary witnesses are often the first to spot unusual objects, yet their reports have historically gone nowhere.

Organisers of the summit argue that this must change. Law enforcement and aviation professionals are trained observers, and their testimony carries weight. New reporting networks aim to collect these accounts alongside sensor data, building a fuller picture of each event.

Veteran researchers involved in the project caution against promises of sudden disclosure. Many say they have heard such claims for decades. What is different now, they argue, is evidence that cannot be ignored.

Data driven analysis changes the conversation. When anomalies are recorded by multiple sensors, analysed frame by frame and published openly, denial becomes harder. Lawmakers are already pressing for limits on over classification, while scientists insist that transparency is essential for public trust.

The goal is not to jump to conclusions, but to replace speculation with measurement. Whether UAP turn out to be unknown technology, natural phenomena or something more extraordinary, researchers say the truth must be grounded in evidence.

With crowded skies, rising safety concerns and growing public curiosity, the push to understand UAP is no longer fringe. As the 'UAP Trap' comes online, scientists believe the world may finally get clear answers to a question that has lingered for generations.

Former Navy fighter pilot David Fravor testified that he encountered a wingless, windowless white object around 40 feet long during a training mission near San Diego in November 2004, saying it mirrored his aircraft before accelerating away at extreme speed.

Another former Navy pilot, Ryan Graves, told lawmakers that the GoFast and Gimbal encounters raised serious flight safety and national security concerns, with crews repeatedly observing objects that appeared stationary in strong winds or travelling at hypersonic speeds.

However, US officials have offered alternative explanations.

Dr Jon Kosloski, head of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, told Congress in 2024 that the infrared footage was “a trick of the eye”, attributing it to an optical effect known as parallax.

US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE

Retired US Air Force Major David Grusch, now an adviser to Congress's UAP Task Force, claimed last month that Mr Trump has been briefed on crashed spacecraft, recovered non-human remains and intelligence concerning their origins.

Mr Grusch said the President could become “the most consequential leader in world history” if he were to make such a disclosure.

The whistleblower has claimed he reviewed intelligence files and photographs depicting non-human bodies, and has alleged that Mr Trump was informed during his first term of multiple alien species - including one said to be crossbreeding with humans.

Previous US administrations, the Pentagon and Nasa have repeatedly denied recovering extra-terrestrial technology or having contact with alien life, and no physical evidence supporting such claims has ever been released publicly.

 Mr Trump has previously hinted that he possesses deeper knowledge about UFOs and the possible existence of alien life.

During his first term, he told his son Don Trump Jr in an interview that he had heard “very interesting things” about the Roswell incident, but declined to elaborate.

In the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, Mr Trump appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience, where he confirmed he had spoken with US pilots who claimed to have seen fast-moving “round objects” in the sky.

The claims were echoed in August 2025 by Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a close Trump ally, who told the same podcast that the US government possesses evidence of “interdimensional beings”.

A crowd of theatergoers stumbled blindly into the snow piled streets outside Shakespeare Theatre Company's Harman Hall. Expletive gasps abounded while everyone demanded to hear their own astonishment echoed in that of their companions. The energy among audience members leaving the press night for Paranormal Activity was that of unfettered adrenaline. 

If they are anything like myself, some audience members may have deadbolted their doors that night. They might have instinctually checked their closets, shuttered their blinds, and awaited the relief of sleep—if they slept at all—with the lights on. They might have found themselves doubly haunted the following day when chilling images and damning utterances unwelcomely entered their minds. In other words, this D.C. premiere, written and restaged by Levi Holloway and directed by Felix Barrett, is not for the faint of heart.

A new story set in the same world as Paramount Pictures' 2007 blockbuster of the same name, Paranormal Activity was developed in Leeds, England, in 2024, premiered on the West End in 2025, and is now touring the U.S. in coproduction between STC, Chicago Shakespeare Theater, L.A.'s Center Theatre Group, and American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. Leaving a trail of well-deserved acclaim, the production is impeccably crafted. It is visually compelling, if not jaw-dropping, in every sense of the word. More importantly, it is deliriously, deliciously scary. 

Paranormal Activity begins in total darkness. Music blares at an ungodly volume, effectively wiping out the senses, until we hear a car screech to collision. A voice tells us to close our eyes. As a blackout curtain rises to reveal a quaint but stunning two-story cottage designed by Fly Davis, that voice is revealed as a podcast documenting our psychological relationship to death and ghosts. It vocalizes the play's most central theme: “Places aren't haunted, people are.”

Newlyweds Jimmy (Travis A. Knight) and Lou (Cher Álvarez) have recently moved to England after a troublesome stretch in their home city of Chicago. Already feeling like an outsider in an unfamiliar place, Jimmy confides in his mother, Carolanne (Shannon Cochran), via FaceTime. While she presses for a grandchild, he alludes to Lou's recovery from a series of mental health crises. Lou later describes sleepwalking, blackouts, and a constant feeling of dread and anxiety. But what sounds like depression and paranoia is clearly aggravated by something more sinister that neither Lou nor her husband can bring themselves to name.

As the couple acclimates to their new life, more disturbing things start to occur. The jump scares start early but intensify as the play goes on: a randomly activated security alarm or a blaring ringtone early on tactfully build the anticipation for the more gruesome reveals of the second act. While Davis (who pulls double-duty as costume designer) crafts the pitch-perfect backdrop for these eerie events, Anna Watson's lighting design is masterfully suspenseful. The cottage atmosphere is always punctuated with chill-inducing shadows and otherworldly flickering. Headlights and sirens occasionally filter in from the outside world, smartly timed so that every environmental change heightens the anxiety in the room. The audience easily believes that something terrible could happen at any given moment and every scare is masterfully earned. 

Jimmy and Lou eventually seek out the help of paranormalist Mrs. Cotgrave (Kate Fry), but even she proves powerless over the situation. A surprise visit from Carolanne begets the penultimate pull-of-rug—a devastating manipulation of theatrical reality that leaves us aching for relief. Pushed to the edge of insanity, the couple finally admits their deepest fears and darkest secrets to one another. When the truth finally unravels, the climax delivers a healthy dose of dramatic irony. 

It's easy to question how effective the horror genre is in live theater compared to cinema. Whereas an on-screen jump scare is controlled by the eye of the camera, the success of an on-stage jump scare depends on how well the director can divert and manipulate the audiences' attention. Fortunately, Paranormal Activity's director Barrett (also the artistic director of British immersive theater company Punchdrunk, best known for Sleep No More) is at the top of his game, using every opportunity granted by his collaborators Davis and Watson—not to mention Gareth Fry's gripping sound design. More satisfying than their collective shrieks is the nervous bargaining that happens when awestruck audience members try to piece the onstage (and backstage) mystery together. Those who frighten easily will buy into the production early on, but even the skeptics will stay for the mind-boggling illusions by Chris Fisher (who became famous for devising the stage magic behind Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in 2016).

To be fair, the dialogue is nothing special—divorced from its impeccable design and direction, we're dealing with run-of-the-mill horror schlock. The magic of this experience lies in the fact that this version of a familiar story is specifically written for the stage and it is the scenic components—the lights, the set, the sound, the costumes—that do most of the telling. Paranormal Activity is a feast for the senses, but it is only here for a short time. One piece of advice for those seeking the most thrill out of this production: Don't shut your eyes.

Paranormal Activity, written by Levi Holloway and directed by Felix Barrett, runs through Feb. 7 at Shakespeare Theatre Company. shakespearetheatre.org. $65–$110.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","Brazilian Surgeon Claims He Operated on a Live Alien in Shocking Varginha UFO Case","https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/alien-surgery-bombshell-brazilian-neurosurgeon-claims-he-operated-live-being-1775614","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:03:00 GMT","

The quiet town of Varginha in Brazil has long been associated with whispers of extraterrestrial activity, but nothing prepared the world for the claim of Dr Italo Venturelli, a prominent neurosurgeon, who insists he performed surgery on a living alien.

His testimony adds a startling new dimension to the infamous 1996 Varginha UFO incident, a case often described as 'Brazil's Roswell'. For decades, the story has divided scientists, UFO researchers and sceptics, but Venturelli's account has reignited debate about whether humanity may have already encountered life beyond Earth.

In a startling revelation, Venturelli described being face-to-face with a sentient, intelligent being in 1996, shedding new light on the infamous Varginha UFO incident and sparking debate among scientists, UFO enthusiasts, and sceptics alike.

According to Venturelli, the encounter began after a mysterious object crashed near the town in January 1996. While driving early one morning, local pilot Carlos de Souza witnessed a cylindrical craft, initially mistaken for a blimp, losing and then regaining altitude before it finally crashed in an open field. De Souza rushed to the site, observing unusual debris that was lightweight, metallic, and strangely resilient, unlike anything he had seen before.

Within minutes, a military convoy arrived, sealing off the area. De Souza recalled being threatened by armed soldiers who ordered him to leave immediately, warning him never to speak about what he had witnessed. The crash site was near a river, close to where local children later reported seeing small, unusual creatures, a discovery that would fuel months of UFO investigations in the region.

Dr Venturelli has now claimed he was called to treat a living alien recovered from the crash. Speaking in a rare interview, he described the being as highly intelligent and aware, with control over its surroundings despite the trauma. 'The creature was conscious, it understood what was happening, and it was not afraid,' Venturelli said. The neurosurgeon reportedly spent three to four minutes in direct contact with the being, performing a delicate procedure while ensuring the alien remained alive.

He also revealed that a video of the procedure exists, though it remains in private hands. 'Many of these witnesses were hounded for decades to come forward, and none have profited from their testimony,' Venturelli explained, emphasising the credibility of the accounts collected over years of investigation.

Multiple witnesses corroborate the incident, including the local chief of police, nurses, farmers, and even the former mayor, who acknowledged the crash publicly. Samples of soil and vegetation taken from the crash site were later tested, showing chemical residues unlike any known substances. The craft itself resembled the so-called Tic Tac UFOs seen in other incidents, such as the 2004 Nimitz encounter in the United States, suggesting striking similarities between extraterrestrial events worldwide.

Over the years, dedicated researchers like James Fox have compiled detailed records of the Varginha case, including testimonies, photographs, and film recordings. These accounts paint a consistent picture of extraordinary events, from the behaviour of the alien beings to the immediate military response, including the secrecy surrounding the removal of the craft and its passengers.

Despite widespread scepticism and ridicule from mainstream media, particularly a notorious broadcast by Rede Globo in Brazil, witnesses remain steadfast in their claims. Venturelli explained that exposure to the story brought personal ridicule, yet he maintained the truth of his experience.

The Varginha incident remains an open secret locally, commemorated by a statue in the town and continually investigated by UFO enthusiasts around the world.

'All of these testimonies should serve as a rallying cry to continue gathering evidence,' Venturelli insisted. As the world absorbs these revelations, the possibility of contact with extraterrestrial life moves from science fiction to a question of history, science, and human curiosity, leaving both believers and sceptics grappling with one simple question: could life from another world truly have been touched by human hands?

When you picture a virtual reality headset user, you're probably not picturing someone like Sherry Dickson. At 69, the snowy-haired, retired elementary school teacher hops into her Meta Quest headset five days a week, for roughly 60 to 90 minutes at a time. She's not attending live concerts or watching immersive films. Dickson, a fitness buff since Jane Fonda workout videos in the '80s, largely uses her headset for one reason — to play Supernatural, a VR fitness game with a huge, loyal fan base and a tight-knit community.

Supernatural isn't dead, but it might as well be. A few weeks ago, Meta shut down three VR studios as part of broader layoffs in its Reality Labs division. As a result, Supernatural will no longer get new content. That's why Dickson is spearheading an online social media campaign to save Supernatural from slowly fading into oblivion.

Supernatural is a mix between a Peloton class and rhythm games like Just Dance or Beat Saber. You swat at targets as they fly toward you, timed to music, inside a picturesque virtual world. You can choose from a library of dance-like Flow workouts, boxing, or even meditative breathing classes. Like any connected fitness game, Supernatural's stickiness relies on an ever-evolving content library. New music, levels, and choreography keep people hooked because they not only keep things fresh, but strengthen the bond between users and the game's charismatic coaches.

“Mark Zuckerberg helped buy a ballroom for a fascist. Perhaps it is not surprising that he killed Supernatural.”

For a game like Supernatural, shutting down content production was a death knell that left Dickson and countless other Supernatural fans blindsided with shock, then grief. The Supernatural Facebook page has over 110,000 members, many of whom have written sprawling odes to the game. Over 7,000 and counting have also signed a Change.org petition, begging Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to rethink the decision.

Dickson is what your typical Supernatural user looks like. In an emerging tech category with expensive hardware dominated by 18-to-34-year-old men, the majority of Supernatural's warriors are women, people over 50, and folks with limited mobility. And in the weeks since the news, they're not staying quiet in their grief.

They're pissed, and they want Meta to know two things. Not only has the company royally screwed up, but they're also not letting Supernatural go without a fight.

“My opinion of Meta can be summed up as @*#&&1 $&#^!@ &^#%,” Regina Lynn, a Supernatural athlete in her 50s, tells me in an email. (Athlete is the term the Supernatural community prefers.) Lynn has been playing for five years, roughly three to four times a week. “Mark Zuckerberg helped buy a ballroom for a fascist. Perhaps it is not surprising that he killed Supernatural.”

Lynn is one of several Supernatural fans who reached out to The Verge to say they see a correlation between what's going on in the world and how Meta has conducted business since acquiring Within, the studio behind the game. Unlike Meta, Within was an independent studio with roots in music videos, feature films, and creative projects. In a Decoder interview, Within cofounder Chris Milk described building Supernatural as “making something that is meaningful to another human being” — something more akin to immersive art than a means to solidify dominance in the VR market. That, in no small part, explains why some fans have reacted so viscerally.

Supernatural was widely considered a successful VR app before Meta ever entered the picture. In fact, when Meta announced it planned to buy it in 2021, the Federal Trade Commission launched a probe to try and block the acquisition — partly because Meta had already acquired Beat Saber, a similar VR game, and Supernatural threatened its dominance. It was also reported that Meta was keen to snap up the game before Apple, which was rumored to be interested in the game. The FTC probe ultimately failed, and the acquisition was completed in 2023.

“This is just a small mirror of a huge problem in our society right now. The blunt way of saying it is those with the gold make the rules. This is what we're fighting on every single level globally right now,” says Dickson. “We're fighting those with the money telling us how our lives will be lived, what we can access, what we can do, and what we can say. … Of course there are far bigger things to fight for right now, and I do. But if I don't take care of my health, my mental health, my physical body? I have nothing to give or fight with for the big causes.”

“I despise Meta along with the oligarchs, the top one percent that continue to destroy our world and kill anything that brings joy and beauty of human experience and connection because their only goal is to make a profit.”

“I despise Meta along with the oligarchs, the top one percent that continue to destroy our world and kill anything that brings joy and beauty of human experience and connection because their only goal is to make a profit,” agrees DeeDee Henry, an avid Supernatural athlete since 2020. Henry, who has participated in beta testing and user interviews for the app, says she finds it “overwhelming” to convey how much Supernatural's community has impacted her.

“We have built a community of love and support with each other. We meet each other, we talk, and we form bonds.”

Behind the anger is a community's palpable loss over the fact that they may lose the very thing that brought them together. To its diehard fans, Supernatural was more than “just a game.” It was a virtual place to prioritize health while making friends. Take Henry and Dickson. A year ago, the two were complete strangers. They were randomly paired together through Supernatural's Together multiplayer feature, which enables joint workouts, supports voice chat, and allows players to create teams. A year later, Dickson and Henry have formed “Team Sunshine” with Henry's 75-year-old mother, Darlene “Cookie” Norman, and a fourth friend, Kelly Hines. The four women play five days a week but have yet to all meet in person, with Dickson living in Canada, Henry just outside Los Angeles, Norman in rural California, and Hines in Ohio.

And it's not just making friends. Marginalized users say Supernatural let them exercise without judgment. Inside the headset, they could lunge, squat, and swipe at targets just like anyone else. They didn't have to worry about being looked down on for not having six-pack abs, being older, working out in a wheelchair, or having a limited range of movement.

Peruse the Supernatural Facebook group, and you'll find hundreds of stories like this and more. More than 50 Supernatural athletes reached out to The Verge specifically to share how the game helped them through deep depression, bouts with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses, as well as rehabilitation from serious injuries. Some have lost a significant amount of weight, while others say it's the only form of accessible fitness that keeps them engaged.

“There was no intimidation of gym settings, no time required to drive there, no time limit on when or for how long I could jump in and sweat. Supernatural is the only reason I bought my Quest 2 headset and is the only cardio exercise I do,” says Vickie Bitter, another Supernatural athlete in her 50s. “It is literally the only thing I use on it every single day.”

“I can't move my ankle, I can't stand up on my toes or anything,” says Jennifer Boyer, a longtime Supernatural athlete who needs ankle-foot orthotics, a type of brace that goes from the bottom of the foot to the knee. For Boyer, maintaining core strength is a necessity while using the braces to prevent injury. Unfortunately, Boyer didn't like gyms because she felt self-conscious and found repetitive strength routines boring. As a result, she struggled to find a workout that would stick.

Supernatural appealed to Boyer because the choreography in the game's Flow workouts kept movements fresh. In these levels, different types of triangles fly toward users to signal whether they should squat or lean into side lunges. They're interspersed with teardrop-shaped balls pointed in different directions, signaling where they should swing their arms. Users with limb differences can also pick a wheelchair mode, choose single-handed play, or adjust settings to accommodate their mobility needs.

“I hurt so much after the first day because I wouldn't stop playing. It was so much fun. You're doing squats and side lunges — I can't do traditional lunges where you step forward and drop a knee to the ground. But with Supernatural, I love the Flow workouts because I feel more like I'm dancing,” Boyer explains.

“I introduce many of my patients to VR. I have a pretty high take rate, meaning that they like it and enjoy it as an intervention,” says Jeanna Duryee, a physical therapist. “In Alaska, I'm fighting depression, deconditioning, and seasonal [affective] disorder at a higher rate [than] in other areas. Supernatural gave me a tool to use to get people that I never seen smile, smile broadly while exercising. I see people that say they hate exercise and hate gyms, but they love Supernatural.”

The fervent devotion among Supernatural fans is reminiscent of another connected fitness platform: Peloton. Like Peloton users, Supernatural athletes have to invest in niche hardware. But a major difference is that Peloton is an independent company whose sole purpose is maintaining and improving on a single platform. Meta may have invested (and lost) billions in VR and the metaverse over the years, but it's notably shifted gears toward its AI. And where Peloton fans love the company, Supernatural fans strongly feel Meta fumbled a rising star.

Given the game's popularity and Meta's ambitions to dominate the VR market, one might think it'd be a no-brainer to invest in Supernatural. But according to Boyer, Dickson, and dozens of other Supernatural fans, the decline in quality was undeniable once Meta acquired Supernatural. Not just in terms of features, but also in community support.

“When Meta said they were going to buy it, everyone was like, ‘Oh my god, kiss of death.' It wasn't long after Meta bought it that they stopped having the extra features they said they would have,” says Boyer, a longtime Supernatural beta tester before and after Meta's acquisition.

“When Meta said they were going to buy it, everyone was like, ‘Oh my god, kiss of death.'”

Prior to the acquisition, Boyer says you could tune into video calls with Supernatural coaches. While athletes couldn't speak to them directly, they could type in the chat and receive personalized shoutouts and responses. After the acquisition, those opportunities slowed down. Instead of directly hopping into chats with coaches, fans were limited to seeing videos and hoping the algorithm would surface their comments on coaches' posts. Boyer asserts that compared to the original owners, Meta never took an interest in getting feedback on new features either.

“There was a new workout every day, and then they started doing new workouts once a week. Then they fired all the user experience people who were managing, pulling together those fun things with the coaches. Then there were no more beta group chats,” laments Boyer, noting that soon there were no new backdrops for the game.“Other app developers should take note of how capriciously Meta fought for, then ditched Supernatural. If you make something you love, you might make a pile of money selling it to Meta, but they're likely to mismanage and kill it,” adds Matt Krzycki, an early adopter of Supernatural.

But for many vocal Supernatural fans, the most painful part of Meta's neglect wasn't the slow decay of the platform or the lack of new content. The ultimate betrayal is how the company has treated the creative team behind the game, particularly the coaches. In nearly every interview, Supernatural fans told The Verge that the Supernatural coaches' openness and vulnerability helped make the platform stand out among the competition. For them, the coaches weren't people inside the headset. They were friends and family.

“It wasn't like when they cancel your favorite show, and you feel bad for everyone in the production and hope the actors get new roles. Instead, these were six people who I personally spent half an hour with almost every day for almost a year,” says Erica Carter, speaking of the Supernatural coaches. “So when they were laid off, when they posted videos trying to be strong and supportive, putting the community first — gosh, it hurts. I cried.”

The love for the coaches isn't hyperbole. When coach Leanne Pendante's husband died, the entire community rallied around her with an outpouring of love and support. Now that the community is suffering, the coaches are returning the favor.

“Yes, I did get laid off and it was very difficult because (a) I wasn't expecting it and (b) this Supernatural community, if you have not met them, they are incredible and they just swallow you with so much love and I just wanted to stay there forever,” coach Mindy Lai shared on Instagram.

“Apologies for not hopping on earlier in the week once all the news broke, but, you know, I got a family to provide for, so once everything happened I had to put my feet to the concrete and hit the streets and start making moves,” says coach Antonio “Doc” Harrison in an Instagram post. “I am so grateful, so honored and humbled to have been a small part of your journey.”

“There have been a couple of times where I'm like, ‘I want to get in! I just want to get in and do a workout, a group workout, let's see who's in there.' And it's hard,” coach Mark Harari says in a recently posted video, trying to motivate discouraged Supernatural users to put their headsets back on.

“We're still here, okay? We haven't left. All the coaches, we're still here. … We're still a part of this community, we're here still to love, and support, and to raise up, and to stand by your side when things are tough.”

When reached for comment, Meta declined to address the backlash it has since received from the community or plans for the future. Instead, spokesperson Johanna Peace pointed to several new features and content Meta released after the acquisition, including a price drop in the subscription, a multiplayer mode, and new artists series and collaborations.

But barring a reversal in its decision, there's little Meta can say to comfort Supernatural fans. Every single fan who spoke with The Verge has said their trust in the company has been shattered. For most, it's a matter of picking which is the lesser evil moving forward.

On Reddit and the Facebook group, some have already posted screenshots of canceling their subscriptions. Others, like Dickson, are trying to rally Supernatural fans to create a grassroots movement that could save the game. Of those who spoke to The Verge, everyone said they'd stick with Supernatural until they can't any longer. For most, the biggest source of anxiety is the music, as no one trusts Meta will renew licenses once they've run out. Once that happens, they fear workouts will begin disappearing, creating holes within the existing content library. Asked about alternatives, the most common response is, “There's nothing else like Supernatural out there.”

“I'm torn because I don't want to give Meta another penny. They don't deserve it,” says Boyer, who invested in three Meta Quest headsets, along with several straps and accessories. “The corporation as a whole does not care about the people who use it. That's the message I got from them and as a result, I will never buy those glasses, their watch, or any of the other things they're trying to develop.”

Pieter Montoulieu is taking a different approach. After five years of playing Supernatural, Montoulieu decided to channel his grief into creating a Supernatural-like prototype game for the Apple Vision Pro. Montoulieu says he's already been hit up by avid Supernatural fans interested in testing and creating custom workouts. Asked why the Vision Pro and not the Quest, Montoulieu says that “shutting down one of the only Meta services that actually made me feel healthier was kind of the last straw.”

For Dickson, the bare minimum that she wants from her campaign to save Supernatural is for the program to remain on Meta's servers with no disappearing songs or workouts.

“What I'd really like to see is an investor — someone of vision — to come along and possibly buy the rights of Supernatural and make it independent again,” says Dickson. Ideally, she says that'd mean rehiring the creative team, and not just the coaches and choreographers. “Maybe on a different platform that's supportive, like Steam. Where this program stays alive and continues to be guided by the Creative Vision of the people that made it in the first place.”

Through a spokesperson, Chris Milk declined to comment.

The mood in the Supernatural Facebook group is a picture in the five stages of grief. Right now, it's between denial and incandescent anger. Frustration with Meta (and colorful insults for Zuckerberg) sits directly alongside hope that this isn't truly the end. Supernatural coaches still pop in to post motivational videos, challenging users to venture back into their headsets and take heart in the community, existing content library, and their shared experiences.

“People are telling me I'm nuts and I'm going, ‘No, no. I will not give up.' It'll take the coaches reaching out to me to say, ‘We don't want you to do this, Sherry.' But they're not,” Dickson says.

For now, Dickson is hoping to stir up the community's fighting spirit. To get them believing that Meta can be shamed into doing the right thing and preserve the app. Or perhaps signal that a dedicated community is still there for potential buyers. After all, Dickson says, Disney reinstated Jimmy Kimmel after a week of public pressure — who's to say it's impossible?

It's possible Supernatural will miraculously get a second life. More likely, it'll end up as another casualty of Meta's shifting ambitions. But, among the hundreds of forum comments and over 50 interviews I've conducted, perhaps this sentiment from Supernatural fan Sherer Minor sums it up best.

“I hope the app, in whatever form I can get it, never truly goes away. In the meantime, I'll keep logging in and punching the air, because punching people is frowned upon.”

Bills worth mocking","https://www.oklahoman.com/story/opinion/columns/guest/2026/02/02/oklahoma-lawmakers-bills-alligators-strip-clubs-conspiracy-theories-opinion/88473695007/","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:57:00 GMT","

It's that long-dreaded time of year again. 

The one leading up to the legislative session when lawmakers unveil their grandest plans to Make Oklahoma Great Again. 

At least in their minds.

For those of us living in reality, it's what I like to call political silly season. Because it's the agonizing period for legislators to unveil ideas that are actually ridiculous and aimed at making our state more dangerous, stripping us of freedoms or inserting more government interference into our lives. And it's all under the guise that we need it — because why wouldn't we know what's good for ourselves?

Each year, some of the bills make me laugh out loud while others make me question whether those we've sent to represent us in the Statehouse have any common sense. But some in this batch feel even worse than normal as lawmakers seek to bulk up their resumes by scoring cheap political points ahead of this year's elections.

For instance, who among us wants to turn Oklahoma into Florida by creating alligator-infested lakes and ponds with carnivorous reptiles?

Because that's exactly what's going to happen if we plow forward with Senate Bill 2087, a harebrained proposal would remove permitting requirements for people who want to raise alligators hatched from eggs in captivity. Currently, in order to raise an alligator, a pet owner has to obtain a permit and written permission from the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, which is how it should be.

We all know of well-intentioned pet owners who are convinced that they can care for an exotic animal until their life circumstances change or a creature gets too big or is no longer a cute baby.

Releasing unwanted pets into the environment is one way to spread invasive species. A law like this will have people releasing alligators into local waterways. Alligators, by the way, lay up 30 eggs each time they mate.

It wouldn't be long before some of our lakes and rivers would be unsafe to swim in.

But I guess that explains why we might need a tax-free holiday month for firearm purchases: alligator protection.

Senate Bill 1278 bizarrely proposes creating a sales tax holiday for gun owners every July. With the threat of mass shootings and domestic violence, what does it say about our priorities that we're considering giving gun owners a tax break when we're not doing the same for Oklahomans who need to buy school, baby and menstrual supplies?

Then we've got the Republican lawmakers who are convinced that someone is intentionally injecting or releasing chemicals into our airspace with the “express purpose of affecting temperature, weather or the intensity of the sunlight.”

Last I checked, our lawmakers aren't supposed to be conspiracists. These measures seem to be embracing the debunked “chemtrail” conspiracy theory in which believers are convinced that the normal condensation trails naturally left in our atmosphere by airplanes are actually chemical agents designed to interfere with the sun, weather or are a nefarious way to psychologically manipulate us.

Good lord.

This seems largely aimed at cloud-seeding, which adds tiny particles into the atmosphere, in an effort to stimulate rain during severe droughts. Though the benefits of this technology remain unproven after 80 years, as far as I'm concerned, if we're in the midst of a horrendous drought and a farmer and rancher wants to try to produce rain on their own property, more power to them.

And what are we going to do, arrest Mother Nature for messing around with the jet stream? Investigate governors to our west for flying over our state to avoid massive snowstorms and heat waves?

Then there are the lawmakers who somehow see logic in a state agency in charge of enforcing liquor laws being tasked with licensing strippers. I can think of fewer things that rank higher on the gross-factor scale than men standing in judgment over a woman's decision to dance in a club.

Why shouldn't an 18-year-old be allowed to strip if he or she wants? In our state, you're an adult when you turn 18.

Supporters of the measure say it's designed to prevent human trafficking and forcing women into unwanted sex work, but I can see this easily going sideways if we let stodgy and prudish lawmakers have their way.

And then don't get me started on House Joint Resolution 1040, which seeks to again ban Sharia Law in this state.

We do not have Sharia Law in Oklahoma as much as Republicans who want to fearmonger against it wish we would.

In 2010, voters tried to ban Sharia Law. A federal judge found the plan unconstitutional and said Oklahoma couldn't. The state had to pay the plaintiff's attorney fees.

That should be the end of it, but 16 years later, we're going to try this again? Isn't that the definition of insanity? What a ginormous waste of our valuable time and resources. 

Let's also not forget that a plethora of dumb bills filed last year are still alive. Those include doubly criminalizing the stealing of shopping carts, giving stormchasers the powers of law enforcement and sending homeless people on one-way trips to other states.

One thing that's different — but scarier — as time goes on: It's becoming impossible to know which bills will meet an early demise and which will cheerfully advance through our Republican leadership.

We can only hope that lawmakers remember what they're actually supposed to do and not get bogged down with delusions of alligators, strip clubs and conspiracy theories.

Ryan Wedding has been arrested. But many of the biggest open questions in his case remain unanswered.

Ryan Wedding has been arrested. But many of the biggest open questions in his case remain unanswered.

Ryan Wedding, 44, has been arrested. But many of the biggest questions of his case remain unanswered.

SANTA ANA, Calif.—Ryan Wedding walked into a California courtroom with a sneer, eyeing investigators in the front row and a swarm of journalists packing the gallery.

Once a top FBI fugitive, Wedding finally faced a U.S. judge in federal court this week, where he pleaded not guilty to 17 felony charges — including murder, drug trafficking and other alleged crimes.

It was a pivotal moment in the years-long pursuit of a Canadian former Olympic snowboarder authorities have labelled one of the most violent criminals in the world, and the first step in what promises to be a sweeping prosecution involving dozens of co-defendants.

Mexican and American authorities had cast a wide dragnet to catch the fugitive, and now they have their target.

Still, many of the biggest mysteries in this unfolding crime story remain unanswered. Here's a closer look at the key open questions in the Ryan Wedding case:

Notorious fugitive Ryan Wedding was arrested in Mexico January 22, 2026

It's been over two years since Jagtar Singh Sidhu, 57, and Harbhajan Kaur Sidhu, 55, were killed in an attack allegedly orchestrated by Wedding.

The couple were gunned down at their kids' rental home in Caledon, Ont., on the night of Nov. 20, 2023. Their daughter, Jaspreet, was shot 13 times but survived.

Authorities later revealed the hit men were allegedly hired by Wedding to kill an Ontario trucker who stole a cocaine shipment from his organization — the killers had the wrong people. 

Since then, the question of how exactly the gunmen got it so wrong has been one of the central mysteries of the case.

The name of the intended target has never been reported; the Star is withholding details of his identity due to ongoing concerns for his safety. 

What is known is that the man worked for trucking companies in the Peel Region and has since been given some element of protection from local police, though the exact details of this are unknown.

It would be natural to assume the man may have previously rented the home where the attack occurred, but local police and American authorities have not confirmed this.

While some arrests have been made in other local shootings loosely linked to the case, police have yet to identify or lay charges against any gunmen in the Sidhus' murders.

“We sympathize with the Sidhu family, who continues to grieve their loved ones as they await answers,” OPP Det. Insp. Brian McDermott told the Star in a statement this week.

He said the probe remains active and ongoing. “We cannot speculate on whether developments in other regions, including arrests, may support the investigation but we remain committed to bringing answers to the family by identifying and arresting the individual(s) responsible for taking the lives of two innocent people,” McDermott said, urging anyone with information to contact police.

“Remember one thing,” her dad told her the morning of his murder. “The day your father will die, he'll tell himself, ‘I love my daughter the most 

“Remember one thing,” her dad told her the morning of his murder. “The day your father will die, he'll tell himself, ‘I love my daughter the most 

Wedding's capture has become a major diplomatic flashpoint between two governments. At issue: What exactly did U.S. agents do inside Mexico?

According to Mexican officials, Wedding voluntarily surrendered himself to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City.

If you ask American law enforcement leaders, and Wedding's lawyer, they'd tell you that's wrong; he was nabbed in what the FBI Director Kash Patel has called a “high-stakes” tactical operation by U.S. agents.

The problem is that from the Mexican perspective, the FBI isn't supposed to be operating on Mexican soil. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum has challenged Patel's description, saying her government would never allow a foreign power to execute such an operation.

Only adding to the confusion, Sheinbaum also publicly pointed to a faked Instagram photo as proof that Wedding had, indeed, surrendered. In the image, a man resembling the six-foot-four Canadian can be seen in front of a U.S. embassy building in the heart of Mexico City in the same outfit he'd later be seen wearing on his FBI perp walk — jeans, a long-sleeved shirt, a Moncler puffer vest and a cap with a distinctive “L.A.” design.

A fake Instagram account shows a man who looks like Ryan Wedding in front of a decommissioned U.S. Embassy building in Mexico City with a caption claiming he surrendered.

But the photo shows clear signs it was created artificially, including a distorted design on the cap and the fact that the actual embassy moved to a brand-new building in November. 

While the FBI has declined to share more details about the nature of his arrest, the Wall Street Journal has reported that Mexican security forces were closing in when they were joined by U.S. authorities who, following an intense negotiation, apprehended Wedding.

It remains unclear if we'll ever learn the truth.

If Wedding did surrender, it could signal he'd become more of a liability than an asset to the Mexican cartels. 

Authorities have nabbing the guys behind the drug distribution, his alleged money man, and even his so-called “cocaine lawyer.” They've also placed immense public pressure on the fugitive and his inner circle after adding him to the FBI's most wanted list and dangling an enormous $15-million reward.

That's a lot of heat; the cartel could have told Wedding, “Look, either give yourself up or, worse, we're not protecting you anymore,” said retired FBI agent Brett Kalina, who once arrested the Canadian on drug trafficking charges in California in 2008.

In a scenario in which Wedding has lost the favour of the Sinaloa Cartel — once run by Joaquín (El Chapo) Guzmán — a U.S. prison may be the only place he's safe from his former associates.

If Wedding is willing to co-operate, Kalina suggested he wouldn't necessarily turn on people in the cartels, but rather their partners around the world.

But that would be a dangerous choice, Kalina said — “He will not survive prison if he gives up the wrong people.”

The possibility that the Canadian co-operates “remains open,” said Martin Estrada, the former U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, who led the Wedding prosecution until he retired in January 2025. The Star interviewed Estrada this week at his Los Angeles law firm, where he now works as a trial attorney.

Striking a deal with any defendant “requires a measured, thoughtful approach and decision by the government,” Estrada said.

However, he added, some people simply should not be afforded the opportunity because their crimes are too severe. “They need to be held accountable.”

The Netflix pitch for the Ryan Wedding story couldn't be more straightforward: Olympic athlete turns Scarface.

But the known timeline of his rise to becoming an alleged international drug lord has some surprisingly large gaps.

The FBI first caught wind of Wedding in 2008, when he and a low-level drug dealer flew from Vancouver to California to purchase 24 kilograms of cocaine from an informant. Wedding was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and sentenced to four years in prison.

Not long after his release in December 2011, Wedding was back in Canada. By 2013, undercover agents with the RCMP had infiltrated his network. They'd spend the next two years uncovering various schemes by Wedding and his associates to allegedly buy and import tons of cocaine linked to Colombian and Mexican cartels into Canada.

Around then, court records obtained by the Star paint a picture of Wedding as a cartel middleman, allegedly co-ordinating drug shipments from the Caribbean with men tied to El Chapo. In 2015, the RCMP charged Wedding and more than a dozen others in the undercover sting dubbed Operation Harrington — but Wedding was never arrested.

A decade later, the U.S. indictments from 2024 and 2025 suggest Wedding spent the intervening time building up a billion-dollar-a-year organization. First, the drugs would be cooked and tested in “cocaine kitchens” run with the help of Colombian neo-paramilitary groups. Next, they'd ship the cocaine by boat and plane into Mexico, hundreds of kilos at a time. Then it was onto semi-trucks destined for California stash houses. And finally, it was loaded onto trucks driven by GTA truckers bound for Ontario.

The logistics of the case are impressive. Still, it's a huge leap to go from a mid-level cartel figure in the mid-2010s to an alleged top boss — and we don't know how he got there.

Wedding, left, in court with his defence attorney Anthony Colombo.

If you ask Patel, the FBI director, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, they'll tell you Wedding is the modern-day version of two of Latin America's most notorious drug lords, Sinaloa's El Chapo and Colombia's Pablo Escobar.

Those comparisons are clearly an exaggeration — but by how much? 

“I don't make comparisons like that,” Estrada said; he thinks each defendant should be looked at “based on their particular conduct.” With Wedding, it's “really, a tragic story,” he continued, “not just squandering his opportunities, but rejecting them, wholly to go in the opposite direction and really become a scourge on his own nation and other nations.”

But how bad, exactly? U.S. authorities have said that Wedding is behind “dozens” of murders, but the indictments link his organization only to five killings.

Comparisons to some of the most-notorious drug lords in the history of Latin America are, at best, an exaggeration.

Comparisons to some of the most-notorious drug lords in the history of Latin America are, at best, an exaggeration.

Wedding himself has been charged with three killings near Toronto, including the Sidhus', and the assassination of a federal witness in Colombia. His alleged second in command, Andrew Clark, is also charged in the Caledon killings and another murder in Niagara Falls.

Attorneys stick to what they can prove, Estrada notes.

“It would not shock me to see that there were other (murders), but when you're prosecuting cases on behalf of the United States government, it'd be very precise and stick to the facts,” the former prosecutor said.

The discrepancy boils down to the intersection of evidence and intelligence, said Calvin Chrustie, a former senior operations officer for transnational organized crime within the RCMP.

Investigators will have “significant” amounts of credible intelligence that may not be attached to any criminal proceeding due to a lack of substantive evidence that meets the threshold of usability, Chrustie said. As well, some evidence cannot be entered in court because “it's too sensitive.”

In short, we just don't yet know how close Wedding was to being what Bondi and Patel claim.

While he was on the run, Wedding was living a life of luxury — high-end clothing, motorcycles, cars and fancy artwork — under the protection of the Sinaloa cartel.

The FBI released photos of items believed to be owned by Ryan Wedding that were seized in December by Mexican law enforcement partners.

His exact whereabouts in Sinaloa have not been made public, but his address was listed as Los Mochis, a coastal city in the state's northwest, in a Mexican court filing last year. (The court records, first reported by local media, show Wedding tried to prevent law enforcement from executing a warrant for his arrest and extradition in mid-February 2025 — just weeks after the assassination of the federal witness.)

That life is over now, but his network hasn't yet been fully dismantled.

Fewer than 10 Mercedes CLK-GTR roadsters were ever made, with the example seized by the FBI worth an estimated $13 million (U.S.).

Authorities are still looking for multiple associates, including the suspects who killed the witness, Jonathan Acebedo Garcia, at a restaurant in Medellín, Colombia, on Jan. 31, 2025.

The victim, a Montrealer who met Wedding in prison before working with him, was set to testify at trial.

And while Wedding's days on the run are over, it remains to be seen what will happen in court — and how, or if, the death of Acebedo Garcia hurts the prosecution.

As for the outstanding Canadian charges from the mid-2010s, the RCMP could, technically, seek Wedding's extradition. But the chances of him facing trial on those offences are incredibly small if he is convicted in the U.S.

            Donald Trump on Monday slammed the Grammy Awards and threatened to sue host Trevor Noah after the comedian joked about the president and Jeffrey Epstein's island.
    


            “The Grammy Awards are the WORST, virtually unwatchable! Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island,” Trump wrote on Truth Social early Monday. The president added he couldn't speak for Clinton, but that he has “never been to Epstein Island.”
    


            Trump, calling Noah a “total loser,” said that “it looks like I'll be sending my lawyers” to sue him for “plenty” of money.
    


            The comedian made the quip in reference to the song of the year award, saying: “That is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense … because Epstein's island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Noah for comment.
    


            The comments come after the Justice Department on Friday released more than 3 million pages of files related to Epstein, the convicted sex offender, including some that contain references to Trump, Clinton and other powerful figures.
    


Of course the Grammys were going to be political. But that's not all that happened



            Trump and Clinton have denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein, who owned a private island in the Caribbean. Trump said last year that he rejected an invitation from Epstein to visit his island, in what he called a moment of good judgment.
    


            “I never had the privilege of going to his island, and I did turn it down. A lot of people in Palm Beach were invited to his island. In one of my very good moments, I turned it down,” Trump told reporters in July.
    


            Clinton has also denied ever having visited Epstein's island.
    


            Trump frequently criticizes Hollywood awards shows for making jabs at his expense. In his post Monday, he said Noah was “almost as bad as Jimmy Kimmel at the Low Ratings Academy Awards.” Kimmel, who has frequently drawn the president's ire, called out Trump onstage in 2024 after he insulted the comedian on social media.
    


            The Grammys ceremony, which aired Sunday night on CBS, included numerous musicians criticizing the Trump administration's federal immigration crackdown. Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, who took home three awards, began one of his speeches by saying, “Before I say thanks to God, I'm gonna say: ICE out!”
    


            During another acceptance speech, delivered mostly in Spanish, Bad Bunny dedicated his album of the year win to “all the people who had to leave their homeland, their country to follow their dreams.”
    


            Some celebrities wore pins that read “ICE out,” which has been used at protests as a call to end operations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","British lord resigns from Labour Party over Epstein links","https://www.rt.com/news/631845-uk-mandelson-resigns-epstein/","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 03:47:00 GMT","

Former British ambassador to the US Lord Peter Mandelson has resigned from the Labour Party after newly released US documents revived scrutiny of his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Mandelson, who was dismissed from his post in Washington last year following revelations about a ten-page “love” letter to his “best pal” Epstein, announced on Sunday that he was stepping down from party membership to avoid causing “further embarrassment.”

In a letter to Labour's general secretary, Hollie Ridley, Mandelson denied any wrongdoing and said he believed allegations that Epstein made financial payments to him more than 20 years ago were “false,” citing his lack of any record or recollection of receiving the money.

“While investigating these matters, I do not wish to cause further embarrassment to the Labour Party and am therefore stepping down from membership,” he wrote. Mandelson also reiterated an apology to Epstein's victims, saying their voices “should have been heard long before now.”

The US Department of Justice released a new tranche of documents on Friday under legislation mandating the disclosure of federal records linked to Epstein. The files include bank statements that appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein's JP Morgan accounts to bank accounts linked to Mandelson between 2003 and 2004.

The documents also include emails and photographs involving Mandelson, including redacted images showing him standing beside an unidentified woman. Mandelson said he could not place the location or circumstances in which the images were taken. The Justice Department cautioned that the files were released without context and that being named in them does not automatically imply criminal wrongdoing.

Mandelson was removed from his post as Britain's ambassador to the United States last year after earlier disclosures revealed continued contact with Epstein following the financier's 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor. He has previously said he deeply regretted maintaining the relationship and described Epstein as a “charismatic criminal liar.”

The latest revelations, which also include new documents and photographs featuring former Prince Andrew, have triggered renewed political backlash in London. A Conservative Party spokesperson accused Prime Minister Keir Starmer of failing to expel the “completely disgraced” Mandelson sooner. Liberal Democrat and Labour figures have also said Mandelson, Prince Andrew, and anyone with relevant knowledge of Epstein's activities have a moral obligation to share any information they possess with US authorities.

            “Saturday Night Live” this weekend featured one of its best political sketches in years. It's about a mother who dramatically reveals to her children that she's having sudden reservations about President Donald Trump.
    


            If you haven't, you should watch it.
    


            And the satire has bipartisan bite. The right can enjoy the insufferable liberal adult children marring their mom's moment of vulnerability with their apoplectic I-told-you-sos. The left can enjoy the caricature of someone they've long anticipated would one day arrive in droves: The regretful Trump voter, finally starting to come to her senses.
    


            But how much does this mother reflect reality?
    


            It certainly appears that more and more Trump voters are coming to a similarly skeptical place.
    


            At the same time, it's not clear how many of them were truly MAGA to begin with. And they generally express their emotions more subtly than the full-on regret that Trump's critics have long sought.
    


            A number of polls have gotten at this question in recent weeks.
    


            A Pew Research Center poll, for one, suggested significant erosion in Trump's support on the right.
    


            The survey showed 20% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said the Trump administration has been “worse than expected.”
    


            Perhaps more strikingly, it showed the percentage of these voters who said they support “all” or “most” of Trump's policies dropping from 67% in February 2025 to 56% in late January.
    


Fox News and New York Times-Siena College polls both recently broke out data on 2024 Trump voters, and the detractors were in many cases significant.
    


            In the Fox poll, 16% of Trump voters said they disapproved of his job performance as president.
    


            But it got worse from there. The survey also tested a dozen specific issues, and on 10 of the 12 – everything except border security and immigration – Trump's disapproval rating among his 2024 voters was north of 20%. It was at least 25% on half of those issues.
    


            That's significant to have 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 Trump voters so consistently on a different page than the president.
    


            The Times-Siena poll showed a slightly smaller 12% of 2024 Trump voters disapproving of his job performance overall.
    


            But again, other data points were worse for him:
    


            What does all of that tell us? It suggests people might be understandably reluctant to say they disapprove of Trump when you asked for a straight up-or-down verdict. But the disapproval shows up more when you dig a little deeper and ask about specific things.
    


            And that tracks with what we've seen before when it comes to the more specific subject of Trump voter “regret.”
    


            We unfortunately don't have good recent, high-quality data on Trump voter regret. The last survey to test this was an October Washington Post-Ipsos survey. It showed 7% of Trump voters said they regretted supporting Trump – compared to 3% of Kamala Harris supporters.
    


            Seven percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a decent-sized chunk. And 19% of non-White Trump voters expressed regret.
    


            The previous data also suggested these kinds of emotions could be building – slowly and subtly – even if they haven't necessarily manifested themselves as full-on regret.
    


            A University of Massachusetts Amherst poll, for instance, showed the percentage of Trump voters who were “very confident” in their 2024 vote dropping from 74% in April to 69% in August.
    


            Only 1% said they regretted their vote, but about 3 in 10 had some kinds of reservations about it – ranging from “some regrets” (2%) and “mixed feelings” (6%) to remaining confident in their vote but having “some concerns” (19%).
    


            The data suggest Trump voters could actually be underselling their overall disenchantment with him, to some degree. They might not be full-on regretful or disapproving, but they seem to be coming to certain realizations about what Trump is doing – a lot like the mother in the sketch.
    


            But just like the mother in the sketch, they might be apprehensive about admitting that to those around them (or even to a pollster).
    


            After all, nobody likes to admit they were wrong – especially when the other side is so annoying about it.

            President Donald Trump on Monday announced he would reduce tariffs on Indian goods in exchange for, among other things, a promise to stop buying Russian oil.
    


            That will be a tall task: India has been importing roughly 1.5 million barrels of Russian oil each day — even months after Trump placed tariffs on Indian goods as punishment — according to Kpler, a global trade data provider. Russian oil makes up more than a third of India's overall imports.
    


            Trump said in a social media post that he spoke Monday morning with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who agreed to replace the country's Russian crude imports with oil from Venezuela and the United States. Venezuelan oil is of the same quality as Russian oil — heavy, sour and perfect for making derivatives like fuel oil and diesel, which India's refineries are already set up to process, noted Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital.
    


            It's not clear, however, how long that transition may take. Venezuela's oil infrastructure is dilapidated and requires about a decade of work and tens of billions of investment dollars to return it to the more-than-3 million barrels a day output it had achieved before the country's Socialist government took control in 1999.
    


            India also buys more oil from Russia than Venezuela produces.
    


            “Fully replacing Russian oil with oil from Venezuela or the US will take significant investment,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Asset Management. “But. over time, this may create additional challenges for the Russian economy.”
    


            India is a major purchaser of Russian oil, which has been sanctioned by most Western countries because of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war with Ukraine. China buys significantly more Russian oil than India — and unlike India, China hasn't faced additional tariffs for purchasing Russian oil. Turkey is a distant third.
    


            Indian government officials have defended purchasing Russian oil previously, calling it essential to the country's energy security. India is the world's third-largest consumer of oil, and Russia is a close-by seller. India relies on its crude to support its fast-growing economy, fueled by the world's largest population.
    


            And Russian oil has traded at a significant discount – roughly $16 a barrel – to OPEC or US crude, making it hard for India to quit, noted Robert Yawger at Mizuho Securities. Even after this agreement with the United States, Yawger said he expected India may flout sanctions and purchase Russian oil, as it has throughout the past several years.
    


            “There's been a zillion different ways they have been able to outflank sanction authorities,” Yawger said. “They'll find a way to go dark fleet and get those barrels moved.” (Dark fleets are ships that use murky tactics to transport oil for pariah states.)
    


            But as oil prices have come down over the past several months, the difference in price between sanctioned oil and non-sanctioned oil eroded, allowing India to make a change.
    


            “When oil prices were high, that was big. But with oil prices coming down, that advantage is not so substantial,” noted Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former chief economic adviser for India's government. “If you throw into the calculus that Indian exporters were suffering from Trump tariffs, it became easier to stop buying Russian oil.”
    


            US crude prices were down 5% to about $61 a barrel on Monday, but that was mostly unchanged from before Trump's announcement. Oil fell sharply earlier in the day because traders were hopeful the United States would reach a deal with Iran without striking the crude-rich country.
    


            That could imply the oil market remains skeptical that the Indian deal means much at all.
    


            “India has been slow-walking these trade talks for months, and the terms here are so vague that they could be anything from major to nothingburger,” said Scott Lincicome, an economist at the Cato Institute.
    


            Trump said Indian goods would immediately face an 18% tariff, down from a 50% – a rate that had included an additional 25% tariff Trump put in place in August to persuade India to stop purchasing Russian oil. A White House spokesperson told CNN that Trump will fully remove the additional tariff and reduce the so-called reciprocal tariff.
    


            Indian goods had among highest tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration. Because of various exemptions, the effective tariff rate on Indian goods was roughly 35%, according to Subramanian.
    


            Trump, calling Modi “one of my greatest friends,” also said India's prime minister agreed to reduce India's tariffs on US goods to zero, and to remove unspecified non-tariff barriers. Although Trump didn't explain which barriers would be removed, those often include special taxes on US companies' services or value-added taxes on goods.
    


            India also pledged to invest in American goods “at a much higher level” in addition to a $500 billion invesment in US energy, technology, agriculture and coal among other products, Trump said.
    


            Trump may have been eager to cut a deal with India after the European Union signed a long-sought free trade agreement with India last week, noted Subramanian.
    


            “If India gives preferential access to the EU, US business is affected,” he said. “There has been a domino effect.”
    


            Although India isn't one of America's largest trading partners, the reduction in tariffs could nevertheless make a meaningful dent: The United States imported $95.5 billion in goods from India in 2025 as of November, 3% of the value of total imported goods, and it exported $42 billion of goods there over that time, according to the US Census Bureau.
    


            Among the top goods the US imported from India last year are computers and other electronics, such as phones, pharmaceuticals, apparel and chemicals. Jewelry prices in the United States have risen in recent months in part because of tariffs on India. Meanwhile, India's top imports from the US were oil, gas, airplanes and airplane parts.
    


            Beyond goods, corporate America has grown increasingly reliant on India. Companies including American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and Google have deepened their footprint in India, hiring workers there rather than sponsoring visas to work in the US and even opened new offices there.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Gold and silver extend slide after record-breaking rally","https://www.rt.com/business/631871-gold-silver-slide/","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:40:00 GMT","



Gold and silver prices fell further on Monday, extending losses after a sharp reversal of a recent rally that had lifted both to record highs.

Gold prices plunged 8% to $4,465 an ounce on Monday, breaking a streak of record highs that had briefly pushed the metal to nearly $5,600 last week, before a partial rebound. Silver dropped 7%, following a 30% slide on Friday.

The sell-off was triggered last week after US President Donald Trump said he would nominate former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh to succeed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, pending Senate confirmation. Trump said he had not asked Warsh to commit to rate cuts, calming fears that the central bank could pursue aggressive monetary policy.

Some of the earlier surge was driven by speculative buying from China, with traders pouring hot money into metals markets, Bloomberg reported, pushing metals far beyond historical trading ranges and magnifying the speed and scale of last week's collapse.

The rally ahead of Friday's crash generated major gains for Russia that are reportedly comparable to the value of its sovereign assets frozen in the West – around $300 billion. Unlike the frozen assets, Moscow's gold reserves can be sold or pledged as collateral, restoring significant financial capacity.

Gold rose above $5,500 per ounce in late January, while silver touched an all-time high above $120. Despite the recent pullback, analysts at Deutsche Bank said on Monday they still expect gold to reach $6,000 later this year.

Mohit Kumar of Jefferies said the sell-off in gold appeared to be “an unwind” of a “crowded” trade.

“Gold was one of the most crowded positions, with positioning reaching close to 8 [on a scale of -10 to 10] on our indices last week,” The Guardian quoted him as saying. “Last two days' move has taken the positioning to just above four. Still on the long side but much less crowded, suggesting that the bulk of weaker hands have been cleaned out.”

Precious metals surged in 2025, with gold posting its biggest annual gain since 1979.

This is Asami Terajima reporting from a very cold Kyiv on day 1,440 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story:

Russian troops are trying to ""bypass and infiltrate"" the destroyed town of Vovchansk in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, and the situation is ""frankly difficult,"" Viktor Tregubov, a spokesman for Ukraine's Joint Forces in charge of the area, said on Feb. 2. 

Speaking on national TV, Tregubov said Russian troops are pressing on Ukrainian positions on the outskirts of Vovchansk. 

""The city is completely destroyed, there is no infrastructure to serve as a barrier,"" Tregubov said, as cited by Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform. 

""And the Russians have been pressing there for a very long time, and the distance to the border is minimal.""

Vovchansk — just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Russian border — endured Russian occupation until the 2022 autumn Ukrainian counter-offensive liberated the town, only to face heavy fighting again after Russia began a new push in May 2024, forcing many residents to flee their homes.

About 80 buildings remain without heating following a Jan. 31 mass outage in Ukraine's energy grid, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported in the evening on Feb. 2. 

Klitschko said over 3,400 buildings were initially left without heating after the mass outage, which authorities said was caused by technical malfunctions that led to the shutdown of two high-voltage power lines amid freezing temperatures. Authorities have remained vague about the exact reason for the accident.  

Russia has intensified its energy blitz in January, targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure with barrages of missiles and drones, in an attempt to lower Ukrainians' morale amid freezing temperatures. Earlier in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that more than 200 buildings in Kyiv remained without heating. 

""Utility and energy workers are working around the clock to connect buildings to the heat supply,"" Klitschko said in his Telegram post.

One person was killed, and two others were wounded by Russian attacks on central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, regional governor Oleksandr Hanzha reported on Feb. 2. 

Russia attacked an area east of Dnipro city with guided aerial bombs (KAB) and drones, killing a 67-year-old man, according to Hanzha. 

Two others were wounded in another Russian attack on Nikopol and its neighboring towns, located across the Dnipro River from the Moscow-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. A 52-year-old man and a 46-year-old woman were injured in the attack that involved first-person view (FPV) drones and artillery, Hanzha said. 

Updated 5:40 p.m. Kyiv time

Russia struck a coal mine operated by Ukraine's biggest private energy firm, DTEK, in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the company said on Feb. 2.

The Feb. 2 attack damaged administrative buildings at the facility. No casualties were reported in the strike, according to the statement.

The news follows a deadly Russian drone attack on a bus carrying miners, which killed at least 12 people and injured 16 others on Feb. 1. in the town of Ternivka.

The attack represents the largest single loss for DTEK since the start of the full-scale war, CEO Maksym Timchenko said.

Feb. 2 was declared a day of mourning in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in memory of the miners killed in the strike.

Updated 4:52 p.m. Kyiv time

The Ukrainian government approved a resolution on Feb. 2 mandating the registration of Starlink terminals to prevent their use by Russian forces, Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced.

The move follows reports of Russia using Starlink-equipped drones, which are particularly difficult to intercept due to their low-altitude flight and resistance to electronic warfare.

Under the resolution, Ukraine will introduce a so-called ""whitelist"" for Starlink terminals, with all unverified devices to be disconnected. The system will be implemented in cooperation with SpaceX, the manufacturer of Starlink terminals.

Fedorov said these measures are currently the only technical solution to counter the use of the technology by Russian forces.

Fedorov's statement came days after Ukraine's Defense Ministry reached out to SpaceX, urging the company to prevent Russian drones from using Starlink, as the satellite internet system could help them to operate further over Ukraine.

The company responded swiftly, with U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk writing on Feb. 1 that SpaceX's efforts to halt ""unauthorized"" Russian use of Starlink seemed to have worked.

SpaceX's initial steps to stop Russia from using Starlink to control attack drones over Ukraine are already delivering ""real results,"" Fedorov said on Feb. 1.

Ukraine's General Staff reported on Feb. 2 ""a series of effective strikes"" on Russian command posts in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. 

Overnight Ukrainian drone strikes hit two Russian command posts, one regimental and another divisional level, in the Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast, as well as an ammunition depot, according to the General Staff. 

In another hot spot of the war, down in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian drone strikes hit Russia's drone command posts, the General Staff also claimed. 

""The Defense Forces are systematically undermining the offensive potential of the Russian occupiers in order to stop Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine,"" the General Staff wrote in its Telegram post.

More than 200 buildings in Kyiv remain without heating as temperatures plunge, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 2. 

Zelensky said that the lack of heating in over 200 buildings is mostly due to the Jan. 31 outage, which authorities said was caused by technical malfunctions amid freezing temperatures. 

Russia has scaled up its energy blitz in January, targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure with barrages of missiles and drones in an attempt to lower Ukrainians' morale as they try to survive in cold temperatures, often without electricity, heating, or water. 

Updated 3:20 p.m. Kyiv time

A shortage of air defense missiles has left some Ukrainian air defense systems empty at times amid the threat of further Russian attacks, Yurii Ihnat, head of the Air Force's communications department, said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on Feb. 2.

With the onset of winter, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in an effort to plunge the country into a nationwide blackout. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air defense forces lack sufficient resources to intercept all Russian missiles and drones.

Ihnat said that Ukrainian authorities, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have repeatedly stressed the shortage of missiles for air defense systems, noting that some of them are depleted and not ready to repel Russian attacks.

""Indeed, before one such attack, we were provided with the necessary means a day in advance,"" Ihnat said. ""Ukrainian forces repelled that massive strike quite successfully, thanks to missiles for F-16s, NASAMS, IRIS-T, and Patriot.""

""There were moments when there was a serious shortage of these missiles. I won't reveal any secrets. For example, there is a NASAMS system, but instead of six missiles in the launcher, there are only two.""

At least 14 people have been killed and 38 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Feb. 2.

The Air Force said that Russian forces had attacked Ukraine with a ballistic missile and 171 drones, of which around 100 were Shahed-type drones. It reported downing 157 drones in the east, south, and north of the country.

In central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a Russian drone hit a bus carrying miners after their shifts near the town of Pavlohrad, killing at least 12 and injuring 16 others on Feb. 1, regional governor Oleksandr Hanzha and DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy firm, reported.

Russian attacks in the southwestern part of the region, in Nikopol and other towns nearby, wounded a 72-year-old man, Hanzha said on Feb. 1.

DTEK reported on Feb. 2 that Russia carried out another attack on its coal mining company's facility in the region, damaging its administrative buildings. No casualties were reported. 

In eastern Donetsk Oblast, regional governor Vadym Filashkin reported that two people were killed and four others were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day.

In northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported that a 20-year-old and a 52-year-old woman were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day.

In the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia and its surrounding region, 12 people were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, regional governor Ivan Fedorov reported.

A Russian drone attack targeted yet another Ukrainian Railways infrastructure, targeting a diesel locomotive, used to generate electricity from diesel fuel, in Zaporizhzhia, the Ministry for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine reported on Feb. 2.

In southern Kherson Oblast, three people were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.

Russia has lost around 1,241,530 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Jan. 29.

The number includes 850 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,627 tanks, 23,981 armored fighting vehicles, 76,585 vehicles and fuel tanks, 36,802 artillery systems, 1,633 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,291 air defense systems, 435 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 121,217 drones, 28 ships and boats, and two submarines.

In a tit-for-tat move, Iran has said it now considers EU militaries to be terrorist organizations. The Iranian president has called for tensions with Washington to be resolved diplomatically. 

This blog is now closed. Thank you for reading. 

Here is a roundup of developments surrounding the current flare-up in tensions between Iran and the West on February 1, 2026:

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that any talks with the US will need to overcome ""mistrust.""

""Unfortunately, we have lost our trust [in] the US as a negotiating partner,"" Araghchi told US broadcaster CNN on Sunday. ""We need to overcome this mistrust.""

The Iranian top diplomat added that ""some friendly countries in the region"" were ""trying to build confidence and to prepare the ground for a meaningful negotiation, and we are working with them, and we are exchanging messages."" Araghchi described these talks as ""fruitful.""

Araghchi met on Saturday with Qatar's Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. The Tehran meeting was also attended by Ali Larijani, the secretary general of Iran's Security Council.

Qatar has good relations with both Tehran and Washington and has mediated between them in the past.

US President Donald Trump said he hopes to reach an agreement with Iran, even though the country's supreme leader warned that an attack on the Islamic Republic by the US would trigger a regional war.

When asked about Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's warning, Trump told reporters: ""Of course he is going to say that.""

""Hopefully we'll make a deal. If we don't make a deal, then we'll find out whether or not he was right,"" the US president said.

In June last year, the US already carried out limited strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities as part of a 12-day Israel-Iran war.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards have no plan to exercise in the Strait of Hormuz, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed Iranian official.

This comes after Iran's state-run Press TV reported that such a live-fire exercise would take place on February 1 and 2, reports which the official called ""wrong.""

Germany Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul criticized Iran for its decision to designate EU armies as terrorist groups.

According to Germany's top diplomat, Iran's decision — which came in response to the EU's addition of Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its list of terrorist organizations — is ""baseless"" and ""propagandistic.""

""Those who violently suppress peaceful protests, execute members of the opposition and spread terror to Europe cannot deflect criticism with political diversionary tactics,"" Wadephul said ahead of a trip to Southeast Asia and the Pacific, adding Germany's support for those seeking freedom in Iran.

""We will not be intimidated by our stance,"" he said.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday said that an agreement had been reached for India to buy Venezuelan oil rather than purchase oil from Iran.

""We've already ⁠made that ‍deal, the concept of the deal,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while returning Washington from his vacation home in Florida.

India has ⁠not been importing significant amounts of Iranian oil because of US sanctions, turning instead to Russia for oil imports after the commodity's price was driven down by Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.   

In August, Trump doubled tariffs on imports from India to 50% in a bid to stop the country buying Russian oil, threatening to go higher with the duties if Delhi did not cease.

However, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in January the tariffs might be halved again, as India had sharply reduced its imports of Russian oil.

 Trump has said Washington is now ""in charge"" of Venezuela following the capture of its president, Nicolas Maduro, by US forces on January 3.

He said the US was going to share oil profits with the country.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned on Sunday that a ""regional war"" in the Middle East would break out if Iran were attacked by the US.  

""The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,"" the 86-year-old Khamenei was quoted as saying by the Tasnim news agency. 

""We are not the instigators, and we do not seek to attack any country. But the Iranian nation will deliver a firm blow to anyone who attacks or harasses it,"" he added.

His remarks come as Washington has sent the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other warships to the Arabian Sea in a move ostensibly prompted by Tehran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.

In June last year, the US already carried out limited strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities as part of a 12-day Israel-Iran war.

Khamenei also compared recent protests to an attempted ""coup"" in his reported remarks.

""They (rioters) attacked the police, government centers, IRGC centers, banks, and mosques, and burned the Quran ... It was like a coup,"" Khamenei said, adding that ""the coup was suppressed.""

An explosion that hit an apartment building in Iran's port city of Bandar Abbas has reportedly killed a 4-year-old girl and wounded several other people.

The blast, which, media say, officials have blamed on a gas leak came a day before a planned naval drill by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway on which Bandar Abbas sits.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has stressed the ""necessity of establishing diplomatic processes"" following renewed military threats from US President Donald Trump.

State news agency IRNA cited Pezeshkian as telling Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi in a phone call that Iran had never sought war and was not seeking one now.

According to the report, Iran ""deeply believes that war will not benefit Iran, the United States, or the region.""  

Pezeshkian's reported remarks come as a senior Iranian official says that preparations for negotiations with the US are underway.

 Ali Larijani, secretary general of Iran's National Security Council, wrote on X that ""contrary to the artificially manufactured media war narrative, the formation of a framework for negotiations is progressing.""

Trump on Saturday seemed to suggest that military action by the US was still on the cards as several US warships, including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, are reportedly deploying near Iran.

""[Iran is] talking to us, and we'll see if we can do something, otherwise we'll see what happens ... We have a big fleet heading out there,"" Trump told conservative US broadcaster Fox News.

The speaker of Iran's parliament said on Sunday that Tehran now sees all European Union militaries as terrorist groups.

The announcement by Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf comes after the EU declared Iran's paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization over its violent suppression of nationwide anti-government protests.

""By seeking to strike at the (Guard), which itself has been the greatest barrier to the spread of terrorism to Europe, Europeans have in fact shot themselves in the foot and, once again through blind obedience to the Americans, decided against the interests of their own people,"" Qalibaf said.

""According to Article 7 of the law on countermeasures against ‍the designation of the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organization, the armies of European countries are considered ​terrorist groups,"" he said.

He added that the parliamentary commission on national security would debate expelling EU countries' military ⁠attaches.

As he made the announcement, he and all others in the Iranian parliament were wearing Guard uniforms in symbolic support of the force.

DW continues its coverage on events connected with the growing tensions between Iran and the United States and other Western countries, as Iran itself contends with fallout from recent, brutally suppressed anti-government protests.

A buildup of US military vessels near Iran has fueled fears that US military action might be imminent.

However, negotiations between the two sides are reportedly taking place or in preparation, with both Washington and Tehran saying they are willing to talk.

US and Western demands that Iran curb its nuclear program are likely, however, to be a stumbling block on the way to any resolution of the current strains.

Critics say financial interests of sterilization companies shouldn't trump public health concerns about ethylene oxide.

Last spring, the Environmental Protection Agency made a surprise announcement: President Donald Trump would consider giving some polluters exemptions from a handful of Clean Air Act rules. To get the ball rolling, all it would take was an email from a company making its case. The EPA set up a special inbox to receive these applications, and it gave companies about three weeks at the end of March to submit their requests for presidential exemption. Hundreds of companies wrote in, including coal plants, iron and steel manufacturers, limestone producers, and chemical refiners. 

One industry was particularly eager for exemption: medical device sterilizers. About 40 of the roughly 90 device sterilization plants that operate nationwide, along with their trade association, wrote in, arguing they shouldn't have to comply with an air quality rule limiting how much toxic material they could emit. That's because these facilities sterilize medical equipment with ethylene oxide, a potent carcinogen that studies have linked to cancers of the breast and lymph nodes.

In 2024, the Biden administration issued regulations requiring sterilizers to cut their emissions by about 90 percent. Companies were given two years to comply, and many had begun installing new monitoring equipment and pollution-control devices to meet the standard. But last year, after President Trump took office, the EPA gave these companies a way out; they could request a presidential exemption. About 40 facilities, many of which are located in residential neighborhoods close to schools and day cares, took advantage of the offer and were granted the exemption through a presidential proclamation last summer.

Now, a coalition of national environmental groups and community nonprofits is suing Trump and the EPA, seeking to overturn the ongoing exemptions. Maurice Carter, president of the Georgia-based environmental advocacy group Sustainable Newton, which signed on to the suit, told Grist that financial interests of sterilization companies shouldn't override public health concerns about ethylene oxide. Any policy change should account for that, he argued.

“You have to do that in ways that are not harmful to the people that live here and to the planet that our children are going to inherit,” he said. Carter lives about a mile away from one of the exempted facilities.

The suit was filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C., and assigned to Judge Christopher R. Cooper, an Obama appointee. Trump's Justice Department, which represents federal agencies in court, has 60 days to respond. 

Taylor Rogers, a spokesperson for the White House, told Grist that the president had used “his lawful authority under the Clean Air Act to grant relief for certain commercial sterilization facilities that use ethylene oxide to sterilize critical medical equipment and combat disease transmission.” The Biden-era rule would've forced facilities to shut down, Rogers argued, “seriously disrupting the supply of medical equipment and undermining our national security.” A spokesperson for the EPA said the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation. 

A provision in the Clean Air Act does allow the president to grant facilities narrow exemptions from one section of the law. But presidents can only grant an exemption if the technology to meet the standard is not available and the exemption is in the country's national interest. The sterilization facilities claimed they met both criteria. In a letter to the president the Ethylene Oxide Sterilization Association, the industry's trade organization, claimed that companies would not be able to meet the 2024 rule “due to the limited number of equipment manufacturers and workforce shortages.” Supply chain constraints and the time it would take to install and validate equipment meant that the control technology needed “is functionally unavailable within the required timeframes,” the group said. 

When the EPA finalized the rule in 2024, it determined that only 7 out of a total of 88 sterilizer facilities “already met the emission standards and will not need to install additional emission controls.” Several others met one or more requirements of the rule. Nearly 30 facilities would be required to install so-called Permanent Total Enclosures, which are among the most expensive pollution-control technologies and seal facilities so that ethylene oxide can be trapped and burned.

Georgia has the highest concentration of exempted sterilization plants; all five of the state's facilities were granted exemptions. By comparison, only two of the facilities in California, which has the largest number of sterilizers in the country, received exemptions. According to records submitted to the state environmental agency, nearly all California facilities already meet the vast majority of requirements laid out in the 2024 rule. One facility in Atlanta met the standards as early as 2022 — yet it nevertheless received an exemption. 

“These are facilities that have been making changes to their processes in their facilities to comply, and yet they received exemptions anyway,” said Sarah Buckley, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the environmental groups suing. (Editor's note: The Natural Resources Defense Council is an advertiser with Grist. Advertisers have no role in Grist's editorial decisions.)

“That shows that the president was not making any good faith determination, was not basing this on an actual assessment of the facts on the ground and the capabilities of these facilities, but instead was just looking for excuses essentially to hand out free passes to avoid the rules,” Buckley added, calling the exemptions a “get-out-of-jail-free card.”

James Boylan, head of the Georgia Environmental Protection Division's air protection branch, said the agency had been working with companies to install upgraded control equipment and revise permits to comply with the 2024 rule before President Trump announced that Georgia's sterilization facilities would be exempted. Some of those updates have since been delayed because of the exemption, Boylan told Grist in an email.

If companies exceeded the Clean Air Act emission limits and faced state action or lawsuits by community groups, they could use the exemption to claim the rules don't apply to them. Companies that are exempted will also be relieved of the cost of complying with regulation. The EPA estimated that it would cost $313 million for all of the roughly 90 sterilizers to meet the new standards. But even those already in compliance could benefit from an exemption, because monitoring and pollution-control equipment require regular maintenance and oversight.

“There is a monetary incentive to not operate equipment even if you already have it,” said Buckley.

Sterilizers aren't the only industry benefiting from these exemptions. Last year, President Trump issued a series of proclamations exempting more than 150 facilities, including dozens of coal plants and chemical manufacturers. Environmental groups have sued over several of these exemptions, claiming that Trump had exceeded his statutory authority. Many of these cases are winding their way through the courts.

Days before Schumer's remarks, the Trump administration bypassed Congress to approve a $7 billion arms sale to Israel.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York) said on Sunday that one of his most important jobs as Senate minority leader is to “fight for aid to Israel,” as the Trump administration's masked federal agents continue their deadly raids of the U.S. with little to no pushback from Democrats.

In remarks at a breakfast gathering of Jewish leaders in New York City, Schumer said, “I have many jobs as leader … and one is to fight for aid to Israel, all the aid that Israel needs.” Part of the remarks at the ​​UJA-Federation of New York gathering were posted online by The Forward reporter Jacob Kornbluh. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) also spoke at the event.

Schumer went on to brag that the U.S. has sent Israel more military funding under his leadership “than ever, ever before,” referring to “many” threats that Israel faces in the region that Schumer does not specify. 

The remark came a day after Israel killed at least 31 Palestinians, including six children, in an airstrike in Gaza, in its latest major violation of the ceasefire agreement.

“As long as I'm in the Senate, this program will continue to grow from strength to strength, and we won't let anyone attack it or undo it,” Schumer said, referring to aid for Israel as his “baby.” 

Implicit in that remark is denigration of those within his own caucus, like Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), who have previously backed legislation to block aid to Israel as it's committed genocide in the Gaza Strip.

On Israel, Schumer is seemingly aligned with the Trump administration. On Friday, the State Department approved nearly $7 billion in weapons sales for Israel, including 30 Apache attack helicopters and equipment for other vehicles — despite the “ceasefire” deal underway in Gaza and no other active wars with Israel ongoing. 

Lawmakers said that the State Department once again bypassed Congress in order to approve the sale. The House Foreign Affairs Committee's top Democrat, Gregory Meeks (D-New York), condemned the sale in a statement.

“Just one hour before doing so, the Trump Administration informed me it would disregard Congressional oversight and years of standing practice, and immediately notify over $6 billion dollars in arms sales to Israel. This is yet another repudiation by Donald Trump of Congress' Constitutional oversight role,” said Meeks.

Meeks said that the Trump administration has “refused” to provide any senior administration officials for a briefing on the sale, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio has “failed to provide any justification or documentation for bypassing” review for the sale.

In other words, the Trump administration approved a sale of arms to Israel likely completely without the aid of Schumer.

At the same time, Schumer is already facing criticism for his lack of energy in leading Democrats against Trump's immigration raids. Schumer's comments on Israel came just eight days after a Customs and Border Protection agent and a Border Patrol agent shot and killed Alex Pretti, and amidst near-daily news of violence and horrific deportations by immigration agents, who have been likened to the Gestapo by critics. 

Just days before, Schumer had struck a deal with the White House to help avoid a prolonged government shutdown, funding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for two weeks while negotiations on his demands are ongoing. His list of demands, including ensuring immigration agents aren't allowed to wear masks, does not include a decrease in the proposed budget for the agency.“

This is another reason I will be voting no on the Senate amended appropriations bill which includes ‘more security assistance to Israel … than ever, ever before,'” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) in response to Schumer's remarks on social media. “No House Democrat should vote yes on a bill that leaves in place triple ICE funding and massive aid to Israel.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            During President Donald Trump's first term in office, he didn't even show up to the Kennedy Center Honors. He felt slighted by the performers, so he shunned the event at the famed John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
    


            In his second term, Trump has tried to remake the cultural center in his MAGA image. Trump “was drawn to the institution for its cultural prestige,” Katy Waldman wrote for The New Yorker in December, but “he and his allies made it radioactive.”
    


            That's why I'd categorize Trump's Sunday night announcement about closing the building for a two-year renovation as shocking but not surprising.
    


            It did come as a shock: staff found out “via the president's social media post,” CNN's Donald Judd reported. But “there had been talk within the organization of a temporary closure at the end of the fiscal year — nominally for ‘renovations' but also to stem the financial bleed affecting the institution amid the backlash from artists.”
    


            Indeed, the numbers tell the story. “In the past year, sales of subscription packages and tickets have fallen dramatically,” The Washington Post reported Monday. “Empty seats became a common sight at the center.”
    


            Equally telling: The sheer length of an NPR article titled “Here's who's canceled their Kennedy Center performances since Trump took over.”
    


Philip Glass withdraws his ‘Lincoln' symphony from the Kennedy Center, citing conflicting values



            Trump's involvement has been a turnoff to many arts patrons, even as he and his allies have portrayed the president as the venue's long-needed savior.
    


            The flood of performer cancellations accelerated after Trump's handpicked Kennedy Center board members voted to add his name to the institution last December.dann
    


            Trump was at the center just last week for the premiere of his wife's documentary film “Melania.”
    


            So now we're left wondering, as this Vulture headline asks, “Is Trump going to tear down the Kennedy Center?” Will members of the Kennedy family try to stop him?
    


            On “CNN This Morning,” Audie Cornish said the rebuilding plan reprises a question related to Trump's East Wing demolition: “Is this a person who's renovating because he's not leaving, or is this a person renovating because everywhere he sees a potential real estate project?”
    


            Despite the recent surge in cancellations, a significant number of events are still slated at the performing arts center. The building is home to the National Symphony Orchestra, which performs multiple times per week during its active season. Regular performances of “Mrs. Doubtfire” and “The Outsider” musicals are still on the calendar.
    


            “If any forethought was given to the livelihood of the musicians who perform regularly in the Kennedy Center, no mention of it was made in the president's statement,” Charles T. Downey of the Washington Classical Review wrote on Sunday night.
    


            The Washington Post noted, “It was not immediately clear what the closure would mean for annual events held at the center such as the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor or the Kennedy Center Honors.” Trump's new East Wing ballroom is not expected to be ready in time.
    


            While short on answers about the impacts, Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell, a vocal Trump loyalist, tweeted Sunday night that “this will be a brief closure in retrospect — and I am confident this sets the stage for a stronger, revitalized National Cultural and Entertainment Complex.”
    


            While Trump insists this is about fixing a “dilapidated” building, “it's not the decor that has driven performers away. It's the decorator,” David Axelrod remarked on X.
    


            “Just like his casinos and other businesses, the Kennedy Center went out of business after he put his name on it,” Brett Meiselas, co-founder of the progressive outlet MeidasTouch, wrote.
    


            “Instead of allowing the Center to return to its arts mission, he'd rather close it than admit his vanity project was rejected by the American people,” former GOP lawmaker Barbara Comstock wrote.

The handlers of a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil at Gobbler's Knob in western Pennsylvania announced that he saw his own shadow Monday morning, thereby predicting six more weeks of winter and not an early spring.

Thousands attended the annual event that exploded in popularity after the 1993 Bill Murray movie, “Groundhog Day.”

It's part of a tradition rooted in European agricultural life, marking the midpoint between the shortest day of the year on the winter solstice and the spring equinox. 

And in eastern and central Pennsylvania, where people of German descent have been watching the groundhog's annual emergence from hibernation for centuries, there's a tradition of groundhog clubs and celebrations that are independent of Phil. 

Some dismiss the Punxsutawney event held every Feb. 2 as an unworthy rival to their own festivities, which they say forecast more accurate weather predictions. There have been weather-predicting groundhogs in many U.S. states and Canadian provinces, and less formal celebrations far and wide.

One thing it's not: serious business.

“We know this is silly; we know this is fun,” said Marcy Galando, executive director of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. “We want people to come here with a sense of humor.”




Celtic people across Europe marked the four days that are midway between the winter solstice, the spring equinox, the summer solstice and the fall equinox. What the Celts called Imbolc is also around when Christians celebrate Candlemas, timed to Joseph and Mary's presentation of Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem.

Ancient people would watch the sun, stars and animal behavior to guide farming practices and other decisions, and the practice of watching an animal's emergence from winter hibernation to forecast weather has roots in a similar German tradition involving badgers or bears. Pennsylvania Germans apparently substituted the groundhog, endemic to the eastern and midwestern United States. 

Historians have found a reference in an 1841 diary to groundhog weather forecasts in early February among families of German descent in Morgantown, Pennsylvania, according to the late Don Yoder, a University of Pennsylvania professor whose book about Groundhog Day explored the Celtic connection.

Yoder concluded the festival has roots in “ancient, undoubtedly prehistoric, weather lore.” 

Punxsutawney is an area that Pennsylvania Germans settled — and in the late 1880s started celebrating the holiday by picnicking, hunting and eating groundhogs. 

The Bill Murray movie caused such a resurgence of interest that two years after it came out, event organizers voiced concern about rowdy crowds drinking all night, people climbing trees and others stripping to their underwear. In 1998, a groundhog club leader wearing a $4,000 groundhog suit reported being assaulted by a half-dozen young men.

Alcohol is now prohibited at Gobbler's Knob, Phil's spot some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh.

The early festivities in Punxsutawney were followed in 1907 by folks in Quarryville, a farming area in Lancaster County in Pennsylvania's southeastern corner. The roughly 240 members of the Slumbering Groundhog Lodge there report the winter forecast from Octoraro Orphie, or least via his well-preserved remains.

Quarryville lodge board chair Charlie Hart credits Orphie as a far better forecaster than Phil. “Octoraro Orphie has never been wrong,” he claimed.

The groundhog is a member of the squirrel family and related to chipmunks and prairie dogs. It's also known as a woodchuck, a whistle pig — or in the parlance of Pennsylvania Dutch, a language with German roots, a “grundsau.”

Groundhogs are herbivores that are themselves edible to humans, although they are not widely consumed. Their lifespan in the wild is typically two or three years.

The Pennsylvania Game Commission says tens of thousands of hunters take more than 200,000 groundhogs in a year.

Game Commission spokesperson Travis Lau found groundhog a bit stinky to clean, with thick skin.

“It was actually really good, no doubt about it — and to my taste, more like beef than venison is,” Lau said. “The whole family ate it and liked it, and everybody had apprehensions.”

Starting in the 1930s, groundhog lodges opened in eastern Pennsylvania. They were social clubs with similarities to Freemasonry. 

Intended to preserve Pennsylvania German culture and traditions, clubs would sometimes fine those who were caught speaking anything but their Pennsylvania Dutch language at meetings. A dozen or more such clubs remain active.

They all share the unifying feature of a groundhog's weather prognostication, said William W. Donner, a Kutztown University anthropology professor who has written about efforts to preserve German heritage.

“I think it's just one of these traditional rituals that people enjoy participating in, that maybe take them away from modern life for 15 minutes,” Donner said.

Some well-meaning efforts have sought to determine Phil's accuracy, but what “six weeks of winter” means is debatable. Claims that a groundhog has or has not seen its shadow — and that it's able to communicate that to a human — are also fair territory for skeptics and the humor-impaired.

By all accounts, Phil predicts more winter far more often than he predicts an early spring. 

Groundhogs are mostly solitary creatures who start to emerge in midwinter to find a mate. The science behind whether they can make any accurate weather predictions is problematic at best.

Among the skeptics is the National Centers for Environmental Information. The government agency has compared Phil's record with U.S. national temperatures and concluded he was right only three of the past 10 years.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican chair of a House Committee rejected an offer Monday from former President Bill Clinton to conduct a transcribed interview for a House investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, pushing the threat to hold both Clintons in contempt of Congress closer towards a vote.

The impasse comes as the full House is headed towards potential votes this week on criminal contempt of Congress charges against the Clintons. If passed, the charges threaten both Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with substantial fines and even incarceration if they are convicted.

Rep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, said on social media that he would insist on both Clintons sitting for sworn depositions before the committee in order to fulfill the panel's subpoenas. A letter from the committee to attorneys for the Clintons indicates that they had offered for Bill Clinton to conduct a 4-hour transcribed interview on “matters related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein” and for Hillary Clinton to submit a sworn declaration.

“The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,” Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said.

The Republican-controlled Oversight panel advanced criminal contempt of Congress charges last month. Nine of the committee's 21 Democrats joined Republicans in support of the charges against Bill Clinton as they argued for full transparency in the Epstein investigation. Three Democrats also supported advancing the charges against Hillary Clinton.




Bill Clinton's relationship with Epstein has re-emerged as a focal point for Republicans amid the push for a reckoning over Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 in a New York jail cell as he faced sex trafficking charges.

Clinton, like a bevy of other high-powered men, had a well-documented relationship with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He has not been accused of wrongdoing in his interactions with the late financier.

After the Clintons were both subpoenaed in August by the House Oversight Committee, their attorney had tried to argue against the validity of the subpoena. However, as Comer threatened to begin contempt of Congress proceedings, they started negotiating towards a compromise.

Still, the Clintons remained highly critical of Comer's decision, saying that he was bringing politics into the investigation while failing to hold the Trump administration accountable for delays in producing the Department of Justice's case files on Epstein.

An Arizona college student is dead, and three others have been arrested after attending an off-campus fraternity event last weekend. 

Officers were called to the scene at around 8:45 a.m. on Saturday, Jan. 31, after receiving reports of an 18-year-old male student of Northern Arizona University (NAU) who was ""found unresponsive"" at a house on South Pine Grove Road in Flagstaff, the Flagstaff Police Department said in a statement. 

""Bystanders inside the home initiated CPR prior to police arrival,"" the FPD continued. ""Upon arrival, officers found the individual not breathing and continued life-saving measures on scene until paramedics arrived.""

The student, whose identity has not been released at the time of this report, was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene, according to authorities.

Investigators later learned the student ""attended a gathering at the residence the previous evening, identified as a ‘rush' event for the Delta Tau Delta fraternity,"" where several individuals – including the deceased student – consumed alcohol, FPD said. 

The incident led to the arrest of three Delta Tau Delta fraternity members, according to police. 

Twenty-year-old students Carter Eslick, Riley Cass and Ryan Creech were each taken into custody and charged with hazing in connection with the student's death, FPD said in the statement.

Hazing is defined, in part, as the ""submission of members or prospective members to potentially dangerous or hazardous circumstances or activities"" that may result in personal injury, according to NAU. 

Detectives are still working to determine the student's manner and cause of death, the FPD said.

In a statement, NAU called the student's death a ""devastating loss,"" while adding that ""our hearts are with his family, friends and all members of our community who are grieving.""

The university also acknowledged the arrest of three of its students and revealed the campus' Delta Tau Delta fraternity chapter has been suspended ""to allow a full investigation to take place and prioritize student safety."" 

""We want to be clear: The safety and well-being of our students remain our highest priorities. Violence, hazing or any other behavior that endangers others has no place at NAU,"" the university added.

In 2022, hazing was criminalized in Arizona under Jack's Law, with offenders risking punishment of up to 3.75 years in prison, according to Fraternal Law. 

The FPD, Delta Tau Delta's national chapter and NAU did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Adrienne Gray and Carrie Sheffield join ‘Fox News @ Night' discuss the media meltdown over the White House renovations, the dismissing of the Venezuela drug threat and American mood over the economy.

Since his return to office, President Donald Trump has undertaken a series of changes aimed at reshaping the look and feel of the White House and other iconic Washington landmarks.

Over the weekend, the president announced in a Truth Social post that the Trump Kennedy Center will close later this year for a two-year renovation.

He said the decision followed a yearlong review involving contractors, arts experts and other advisers. He added that the temporary closure would allow the renovations to be completed faster and at a higher quality than if construction were carried out while performances continued. It was not immediately clear what renovations were planned, how much it would cost and what would happen to the scheduled performances.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES TWO-YEAR CLOSURE OF TRUMP KENNEDY CENTER FOR MAJOR RENOVATIONS

The Trump Kennedy Center renovations are the latest in a series of design projects the former real estate developer has pursued since returning to the White House. Read on to learn more about how the world's most famous real estate developer is leaving his mark on Washington.

In October, Trump unveiled a new monument dubbed the ""Arc de Trump,"" which is planned to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary next year.

At a White House ballroom fundraising dinner, Trump shared additional details about the newest monument planned for the nation's capital. He said he was presented with three arch models in varying sizes — small, medium and large — and said his preference was for the largest one.

If Trump chooses the largest proposed design, the arch would rise 250 feet, eclipsing the height of the Lincoln Memorial and rivaling the U.S. Capitol dome.

The monument, a near twin of Paris's iconic Arc de Triomphe, is meant to welcome visitors crossing the Memorial Bridge from Arlington National Cemetery into the heart of the nation's capital.

Trump's taste for opulence is unmistakable in the Oval Office, where golden accents now decorate the nation's most iconic workspace, a reflection of his personal style. Last March, Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham during a tour of the Oval Office that the room ""needed a little life"" when asked about the gold details.

""Throughout the years, people have tried to come up with a gold paint that would look like gold, and they've never been able to do it,"" Trump told Ingraham. ""You've never been able to match gold with gold paint, that's why it's gold,"" Trump added.

Since then, Trump has added gold accents throughout the Oval Office to include decorative details along the ceiling and around the doorway trim. Even the cherubs inside the door frames were given a gilded makeover.

White House spokesperson Davis Ingle previously told Fox News Digital that the gold Trump added to the Oval Office ""is of the highest quality,"" declining to provide further details. 

The spokesperson also said that Trump personally covered the cost of the gold accents, though they did not specify how much gold was added or how much Trump spent.

Outside the Oval Office, the Trump administration unveiled the ""Presidential Walk of Fame,"" a series of portraits of past presidents now displayed along the West Wing colonnade. The portrait of former President Joe Biden features his signature, created with an autopen, a machine that holds a pen and reproduces a person's handwriting through programmed movements.

Trump said he renovated the Lincoln bathroom in the White House because it did not reflect the style of President Abraham Lincoln's era. 

""I renovated the Lincoln Bathroom in the White House. It was renovated in the 1940s in an Art Deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,"" Trump wrote in an Oct. 31 Truth Social post.

""I did it in black and white polished statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and in fact could be the marble that was originally there,"" he added.

Among the largest projects currently underway is a 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom designed to accommodate roughly 650 seated guests. 

On July 31, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the planned construction of the sprawling ballroom. ""The White House is currently unable to host major functions honoring world leaders in other countries without having to install a large and unsightly tent approximately 100 yards away from the main building's entrance,"" Leavitt said during a press briefing, adding the new ballroom will be ""a much-needed and exquisite addition.""

The White House does not have a formal ballroom, and the new ballroom will take the place of the East Wing. Construction has already begun on the White House grounds, and the estimated cost is north of $200 million and will be financed by Trump and private donors.

Ahead of Independence Day, Trump also personally financed the installation of two 88-foot flagpoles with American flags in front of and behind the White House, each reportedly costing around $50,000. The new flags on the North and South Lawns were raised at a June 18 ceremony.

Retired Gen. Jack Keane joins 'Fox & Friends' to weigh in on the upcoming trilateral peace talks between the U.S., Russia and Ukraine in Abu Dhabi to try and end the Russia-Ukraine war and the deadly protests in Iran.

A Russian cargo plane typically used to transfer military equipment landed at a military airfield in Havana Sunday night, echoing flight patterns seen ahead of the capture of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela.

The U.S.-sanctioned Ilyushin Il-76, operated by Russian state-linked airline Aviacon Zitotrans, was tracked landing at San Antonio de los Baños Airfield, a Cuban military installation roughly 30 miles south of Havana, according to public flight data.

Flight-tracking records show the aircraft stopped in St. Petersburg and Sochi in Russia; Mauritania, Africa; and the Dominican Republic. Each landing would have required approval from host governments, offering a window into which countries are continuing to permit Russian military-linked aviation activity despite Western sanctions.

The same aircraft conducted flights to Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba in late October 2025, as tensions between Washington and Caracas escalated. That movement preceded U.S. military action in Venezuela that ultimately ended Maduro's rule — a sequence U.S. officials and analysts have since pointed to as a warning indicator when evaluating similar Russian aviation activity in the region.

Now, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel finds himself under mounting pressure from President Donald Trump, who has sharply intensified U.S. policy toward Havana in recent weeks.

On Thursday, Trump declared a national emergency related to Cuba, asserting that the Cuban government poses an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The administration also said it would impose penalties on any country that sells or supplies oil to Cuba without U.S. authorization.

Trump confirmed Sunday that the U.S. is engaged in direct talks with Cuban officials.

TRUMP SAYS CUBA IS ‘READY TO FALL' AFTER CAPTURE OF VENEZUELA'S MADURO

""Cuba is a failing nation. It has been for a long time, but now it doesn't have Venezuela to prop it up,"" Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago, Florida. ""So we're talking to the people from Cuba, the highest people in Cuba, to see what happens. I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba.""

Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have both indicated support for political change in Havana, though the administration has not said whether it would pursue that objective through military action.

Russian military ties to Cuba have repeatedly triggered concern in Washington. While the Soviet Union's footprint on the island receded after the Cold War, Moscow has steadily rebuilt defense and intelligence cooperation with Havana over the past decade. U.S. officials have warned that renewed Russian activity in Cuba could pose security risks close to the U.S. mainland.

The Il-76 is a heavy transport aircraft capable of carrying roughly 50 tons of cargo or up to 200 personnel, a capability that has drawn scrutiny given the operator's history. Aviacon Zitotrans has been sanctioned by the United States, Canada and Ukraine for supporting Russia's defense sector.

""Aviacon Zitotrans has shipped military equipment such as rockets, warheads, and helicopter parts all over the world,"" the U.S. Treasury Department said in January 2023, when it added the airline to its sanctions list.

It remains unclear what cargo the aircraft carried on its most recent flight. During earlier operations in Venezuela, Russian state media and a Russian lawmaker said the same aircraft delivered Pantsir-S1 short-range and Buk-M2E medium-range air defense systems to Caracas.

HHS whistleblower Tara Rodas joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss DHS efforts to rescue more than 145,000 missing migrant children who were lost under the Biden administration.

Police arrested an illegal immigrant in Florida on charges of arson and felony criminal mischief, Florida police announced Sunday.

Authorities say Marcelino Gillen-Hernandez attempted to start two fires on a property in Wahneta, Florida. Authorities first received reports from the property's owner, who said she was able to extinguish the latest blaze with a garden hose after she saw it glowing under a mobile home on the property.

She told police that Hernandez admitted to her that he had started both fires, one earlier in January and another this weekend. Hernandez said he had been told to do so by people ""at a residence he used to live at,"" the owner told authorities.

Authorities say Hernandez made the same confession when being interviewed by police.

After Hernandez was taken into custody, he told deputies that he had also previously broken some windows at the Placita Mexico store in Wahneta, police said.

""Hernandez stated that on the first occasion he attempted to break a window using a rock but was unsuccessful. He advised that on a subsequent occasion he returned and successfully broke a door window. On another occasion, he stated he struck a door with a hammer in combination with a rock,"" police wrote.

Hernandez is being charged with three counts of unoccupied burglary, two counts of criminal mischief with property damage less than $1,000 dollars, and one count of criminal mischief with property damage $1,000 or more. He is also facing two counts of arson.

""We also learned he threatened to kill a 74-year-old man with a knife in 2024 and was arrested for aggravated assault on a person over 65 years old. He should have been deported back then and perhaps he wouldn't have been here to terrorize and victimize others,"" Judd added.

The Trump administration has been on defense over its immigration enforcement operations since the shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse who was killed during an altercation with Border Patrol agents.

But, after a second video was released showing Pretti in an earlier incident with immigration enforcement officials, Republicans are divided over whether to follow the president's lead and relitigate the incident politically.

The second video of Pretti, recorded by media company The News Movement on Jan. 13, shows the ICU nurse calling agents “f***ing trash” and kicking out the taillight of a vehicle used by the agents. After Pretti kicked out the taillight, the vehicle stopped, and a federal officer exited before grabbing Pretti and tackling him to the ground. 

After a skirmish, Pretti escaped from the officer and went toward the crowd. The officer did not pursue him. The video also shows what appears to be a gun tucked into Pretti's waistband.

PRETTI SPAT AT FEDERAL AGENTS IN CONFRONTATION DAYS BEFORE KILLING: VIDEO

Trump, who has previously said he wants to “de-escalate” the situation and called Pretti's death a very “unfortunate incident,” took to Truth Social at 1:26 a.m. on Jan. 30 to call Pretti an “agitor” and “perhaps, insurrectionist.”

“Alex Pretti's stock has gone way down with the just released video of him screaming and spitting in the face of a very calm and under control ICE Officer, and then crazily kicking in a new and very expensive government vehicle, so hard and violent, in fact, that the taillight broke off in pieces,” Trump wrote on Truth Social regarding the second video. “It was quite a display of abuse and anger, for all to see, crazed and out of control. The ICE Officer was calm and cool, not an easy thing to be under those circumstances! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.”

Trump's comments about Pretti came after he shook up his deportation operations in Minnesota, sending in border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis to replace Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, who had previously been leading the administration's on-the-ground operations, in the aftermath of the shooting. 

Homan's deployment to Minnesota, in which he will be reporting directly to Trump, was announced after statements from Bonvino, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem referring to Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” and claiming that he wanted to do “maximum damage” were contradicted by video footage of the shooting.

A White House official told the Washington Examiner that there “is an ongoing investigation into the death of Alex Pretti and President Trump has been clear he supports a fact-based investigation.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), speaking on the Senate floor later Friday, conceded there should be an investigation into Pretti's death, but argued it was wrong to suggest the ICU nurse didn't have an agenda. 

“Look what happened 10 days before,” Graham said, referring to the Jan. 13 video, “Maybe excessive force. Let's look. But don't play a game like the people out in the streets that are harassing ICE that they're not part of the problem.” 

A source close to the White House, granted anonymity to speak candidly, told the Washington Examiner that it is still “very premature to call him a domestic terrorist or a peaceful protester,” pointing to the ongoing investigation and unseen body camera footage of the incident. 

But, the source argued that the second video showed that Pretti was a “career protester.”

While the president and some of his allies appear ready to go back on the offense, not everyone in the party agrees with the tactic. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who has called for Noem's removal atop DHS, rebuked Trump's comments about Pretti, saying there is “no place” for the rhetoric. 

“Clearly, if you look at the video the week before, he was agitated, by definition, you don't go in and kick anybody's car, let alone a truck full of ICE agents, and not view that as an agitating event, right?” Tillis said to reporters on Friday. “Maybe that's when they should have arrested him, because he actually damaged government property.” 

He continued, “But ‘stock going down' — My God, we're talking about a man who died on the street, which, you know, we'll let the investigation come out. It's just no place for that. I don't think the American people are gonna like that. We're kind at the end of the day. We're a little bit edgy, but we're a pretty kind population, and I don't think they like bullies in that image up there.”

Matthew Bartlett, a GOP strategist who was an appointee to the State Department in Trump's first administration, said that while the second video was “more context,” it was “in no way a justification or an excuse” for the shooting of Pretti on Jan. 24.

“I would say, you know, you let the video stand for itself,” Bartlett said. “I would certainly not continue to pursue this narrative. I don't think there's any good that our country benefits from.”

Bartlett continued, “Again, it is context. I'm not sure it is going to change anyone's mind, because it is a separate, unrelated incident, if anything. Again, I would not continue to dig on this issue. It seems, again, the president can be crazy. He is not stupid. He saw how this happened, how it unfolded. He saw the administration's response. He chose Tom Homan. Let cooler heads prevail, and let's try to, politically, find, you know, some firmer ground.”

The shootings of Pretti and Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minnesota resident and U.S. citizen who was killed earlier this month by an immigration enforcement officer, come as Republicans prepare to defend their control of the House and Senate in the 2026 midterm elections.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE FATAL SHOOTING INVOLVING BORDER PATROL IN MINNESOTA

A GOP operative, granted anonymity to speak about campaign operations, expressed plans to stay away from “discussing or really just litigating the situation as a whole” in GOP campaigns. 

“That kind of goes for any of these situations that have happened over the past couple weeks,” the operative said. “I think we're just talking about the issue more broadly. So I think what we're trying to avoid on the messaging front, especially like in this national level, is like — All right, we can go back — Republicans, Democrats can go back and forth about these specific situations, but at the end of the day, DHS, ICE, is enforcing the laws that are on the books.”

“I think we're making a certain effort to make that clear contrast. And I think the contrast is a national level, is, you know, Republicans are enforcing laws, Democrats are for lawlessness,” the operative continued. “I don't think we're going to stray away from the issue as a whole, immigration and border security, because it's still our issue. But when it gets into these individual situations, you know, on the campaign side of things, I don't think we really need to litigate it.”

A yearslong fight over access to 2020 election records from the Atlanta area culminated in an FBI raid last week, during which agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at the main election facility in Fulton County, Georgia.

Federal agents spent a full day searching the Fulton County Election Hub and Operations Center in Union City on Wednesday, seizing ballots and election records tied to the 2020 presidential contest as part of an investigation examining potential violations of federal election laws. The operation marked a sharp turn in a dispute that began with state subpoenas, expanded into parallel state and federal court battles, and ultimately drew the involvement of senior Trump administration officials, including the nation's top intelligence officer.

According to a copy of the search warrant, agents were authorized to seize all physical ballots, tabulator tapes, electronic ballot images, and voter rolls generated during the 2020 election from the county's main election facility, along with related electronic data tied to ballot tabulation and voter registration. The warrant cites potential violations of federal laws governing the preservation of election records and the submission of fraudulent votes. Federal officials have not identified any suspects, and the potential target of the investigation remains sealed.

The search unfolded as the Trump administration intensified renewed scrutiny of the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, a contest President Donald Trump has long insisted was stolen despite failed legal challenges to the results across the country. Georgia, one of the battleground states Trump narrowly lost, has remained a central focus of his complaints, including his now-infamous call urging the Georgia secretary of state to “find” additional votes.

Trump again hinted at looming legal consequences last week, asserting that “people will soon be prosecuted for what they did” in reference to the 2020 election, though he did not specify whom he was referring to or what conduct he believed warranted charges.

What stood out during Wednesday's FBI raid was the presence of Tulsi Gabbard outside the election facility during the raid. The director of national intelligence typically has no domestic law enforcement authority and oversees intelligence agencies that are generally barred from operating within U.S. borders absent a national security justification, but Gabbard was still present for the Fulton County search.

White House officials told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that Gabbard has spent months leading an administration-wide effort to re-examine the 2020 election, including assessing claims of foreign interference and vulnerabilities in election infrastructure. Her work has involved coordination with senior DOJ officials and outside legal allies of Trump, and she has regularly briefed the president and chief of staff Susie Wiles, officials said.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche addressed questions from reporters on Friday about Gabbard's appearance, rejecting suggestions that her presence was improper or unrelated to the Justice Department's work.

“She happened to be present in Atlanta,” Blanche said. “I mean, yes, I saw the same photos you did. She doesn't work for the Department of Justice or the FBI. She's an extraordinarily important part of this administration. This administration coordinates everything we do as a group.”

When pressed on whether Gabbard's appearance had nothing to do with the DOJ, Blanche pushed back.

“I most certainly did not say that,” he said. “This administration works closely together in all kinds of different areas. If there's surprise that the administration is working together on things like election integrity, let me unequivocally state we are working together as an administration on election integrity-type issues.”

The raid also came amid a quiet leadership change inside the FBI. According to people familiar with the matter, the bureau moved last week to replace its top agent in Atlanta, Paul W. Brown, ABC News reported. The move was not publicly announced, and officials declined to explain the decision, which occurred days before the Fulton County search.

The events that preceded the raid on Wednesday date back to Nov. 5, 2024, when Georgia's State Election Board issued two subpoenas seeking access to Fulton County's 2020 election materials. Fulton County moved to block the subpoenas on Nov. 18, 2024, filing a motion to quash in county court.

After a shift to a conservative majority on the State Election Board in mid-2025, the board escalated its efforts. On July 30, the board passed a resolution formally seeking assistance from Attorney General Pam Bondi to compel compliance. New subpoenas from the state board followed on Oct. 6, demanding all used and void ballots, ballot stubs, signature envelopes, and related digital files from the 2020 election.

The DOJ entered the dispute later that month, sending a letter on Oct. 30, demanding all records responsive to the State Election Board subpoena. Fulton County responded on Nov. 14, stating the materials were under seal under Georgia law and could not be produced without a court order. The DOJ then sent a follow-up demand to county clerk Che Alexander on Nov. 21, according to court filings.

The controversy intensified during a State Election Board meeting on Dec. 9, when county officials acknowledged that more than 130 tabulator tapes, covering roughly 315,000 early in-person votes, lacked required poll-worker signatures. The admission gained wider attention in late December after local outlets were made aware of the major error.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, downplayed the error in a statement later that month, claiming it was a “clerical” mistake that would not have “erased valid, legal votes.”

The DOJ filed suit against Fulton County on Dec. 11, seeking a declaration that the county was violating Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1960 and asking a judge to order the production of the records within five days of a court order.

In state court, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled on Dec. 22 that the county could not block the State Election Board subpoenas and ordered officials to provide a cost breakdown for compliance by Jan. 7, after the county claimed production would cost roughly $400,000.

Alexander moved to dismiss the federal lawsuit on Jan. 5, arguing the dispute belonged in state court. Fulton County submitted its cost estimate on Jan. 7, which the State Election Board challenged on Jan. 14. The DOJ filed its response opposing dismissal on Jan. 20, arguing federal law gives the attorney general broad authority to demand election records. No substantive rulings have been issued.

On Jan. 23, McBurney set a March 9 hearing to resolve the cost dispute. Five days later, FBI agents arrived unannounced and seized the records directly under a magistrate-approved warrant.

The raid took place in the same county that ultimately failed to pull off its attempted high-profile prosecution of Trump before his return to the White House. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, an elected Democrat, accused him and several co-defendants of attempting to illegally overturn the results of the 2020 election.

In August 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others for alleged efforts to overturn Georgia's election results. That case was dismissed in November after courts barred Willis and her office from pursuing it due to an “appearance of impropriety” stemming from her romantic relationship with a prosecutor she appointed to lead the case.

While officials have not said whether the search was prompted by evidence of wrongdoing or alleged obstruction in producing the records, the scope of the warrant underscores how a dispute that began with subpoenas and civil litigation has now crossed into a full federal criminal investigation involving the highest echelons of the DOJ.

The raid has drawn condemnation by several of the state's top Democratic officials, including Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), who said the nation should feel “absolutely shook” by the developments. Other Democrats, including ranking members of congressional intelligence committees, have demanded Gabbard testify before Congress about her appearance at the FBI raid.

FBI EXECUTES SEARCH WARRANT AT FULTON COUNTY ELECTION FACILITY

Meanwhile, Republican members of the State Election Board, including Janice Johnson, celebrated the FBI's effort as one that would ultimately provide transparency to their effort to see the county's records.

“Our subpoena is still active,” Johnson said. “We will seek confirmation that the election documents we are seeking are now in the custody of the FBI.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

What I learned when I finally started assigning the hard reading again.

At some point over the past 15 years, kids stopped reading. Or at least their teachers stopped asking them to read the way they once did. We live in the age of the reel, the story, the sample, the clip. The age of the excerpt. And even in old-fashioned literature classes, assignments have been abbreviated so dramatically that high-school English teachers are, according to one recent survey, assigning fewer than three books a year.

I've seen the effects of this change up close, having taught English in college classrooms since 2007, and I've witnessed the slow erosion of attention firsthand, too: students on computers in the back of lecture halls, then on phones throughout the classroom, then outsourcing their education to artificial intelligence. We know that tech companies supply the means of distraction. But somehow the blame falls on the young reader. Whole novels aren't possible to teach, we are told, because students won't (or can't) read them. So why assign them?

When I walked into my American-literature class at Case Western Reserve University last fall, I looked at 32 college students, mostly science majors, and expected an uphill battle. As my colleague Rose Horowitch has reported, “Many students no longer arrive at college—even at highly selective, elite colleges—prepared to read books.” One-third of the high-school seniors tested in 2024 were found not to have basic reading skills.

Yet by the end of the semester, as we read the last sentence of Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon, I regretted ever doubting my students. I am now convinced that I was wrong to listen to the ostensible wisdom of the day—and that teachers of literature are wrong to give up assigning the books we loved ourselves. There may be plenty of good reasons to despair over the present. The literature classroom should not be one of them.

The image of a college literature class hasn't changed much in the past 50 years. A group of students are sitting around a table, or maybe they're perched in a lecture hall, looking down at a passage by Melville, reading a sentence out loud, puzzling over a metaphor, feeling the jolt of possibility that comes when their world is reimagined in startling language. My most vivid memory of reading an entire novel in college was picking up Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse. On an unseasonably warm spring night in 2002, I propped myself against the steps of the library, opened the book, and stayed there until the early morning.

Idrees Kahloon: America is sliding toward illiteracy

I've taught for nearly two decades, but last fall I was worried in a way I'd never been before. I've always assigned long, challenging books. I regularly teach To the Lighthouse to first-year students, sometimes swapping it out for James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man or Mulk Raj Anand's Untouchable. But anecdotes and statistics about the decline of reading unsettled me. Plus, I was worried about my own raddled attention span, and I was unnerved by the apparent inevitability of AI-generated essays.

My course, a survey of American literature from 1660 to the present, felt like a dare: 400 years of literature in a single semester. And yet my fears that students might refuse to read helped clarify my approach. Instead of hopscotching from one excerpt to the next, I'd create small eddies in time. We'd spend several days, sometimes a couple of weeks, on a single author. We'd read nonfiction and novels—Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Faulkner's As I Lay Dying, Willa Cather's My Ántonia—and long poems. I couldn't be comprehensive; the course's remit was, essentially, Puritans to the present. I was, instead, serious about reading whole books (and sermons: It's impossible not to include Jonathan Edwards's “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” if you're seeking to understand early American literature). I would teach the students what I was starting to miss myself: tarrying with an author beyond his best-known works, developing a relationship with a novelist across wildly different novels.

Two things became clear in the early weeks of class. First, the students were reading. They were reading everything, or most of it. I know this because I had them identify obscure passages, without notes, devices, or books at hand. Second, they were experiencing life in a way that was not easy outside the class and its assignments. They were expected—required—to give huge chunks of time to an activity, reading, that was not monetizing their attention in real time. They had, in effect, taken back their lives, for an hour or two each day. It turned out that American literature, which so often flirts with utopian fantasies of regaining control—hello, Walden!—could do precisely that.

To give the students time to read, I had to change the way they wrote. I axed the take-home essays I'd assigned before—this wasn't a “writing” class, anyway—and assigned what I suspected were far more difficult in-class, timed “flash essays,” with prompts I gave the same day. No trudging back from the library with 10 pages on Woolf in the special season of Cleveland weather we call “stupid cold.” Long, research-based essay assignments had always worked well for the top students in the class, the ones who were already trained to write. But I've rarely seen, over the course of my career, the kind of development I hoped for in the majority of students whom I asked to write that way.

I was also thinking of the writing I myself had been doing lately, smooshed within the hour I had for lunch, or pounded out on the couch after toddler bedtime. I wanted my students to have a taste of the adrenaline and, yes, stress that came from writing when faced with real time constraints. I wanted edge-of-the-seat writing that opened itself up to failure. They would confront their fear without guardrails, without bumpers, without AI-drafted support, without a plan or even a thesis. One student came up to me after the first flash essay, a little frustrated and worried that he wasn't meeting the mark. He felt like he was writing into the complete unknown, rather than with a plan in mind. I said that was exactly the point.

In a haunting sentence from Austerlitz, by the German novelist W. G. Sebald, the titular character describes losing control of his language. Once a fluent and successful writer, Austerlitz suddenly falls into a crisis of faith about the sentence, which becomes “at best a makeshift expedient, a kind of unhealthy growth issuing from our ignorance, something which we use, in the same way as many sea plants and animals use their tentacles, to grope blindly through the darkness enveloping us.” I liked the metaphor of writing into the darkness. So I devised simple essay topics that asked students to write about their own difficulties as readers. One was: “Write about a moment in an Emily Dickinson poem that you don't understand.” Another was: “Write about your morning routine, but in the style of Faulkner.” I didn't want to create 32 new Faulkners. I wanted the students to experience the moment when their own style broke through the imitation, when the attempt to write like Faulkner failed and revealed, as a kind of photonegative, their own emergent voices. John Keats called this state of being “negative capability,” a condition in which the writer leans to live in a perpetual state of uncertainty. If it was really true that the students couldn't read, then it was up to me to put the books in their way and make them deal with them.

Adults underestimate the power of simply telling a young person to read a book and vouching for it ourselves. A teacher gave me Leo Tolstoy and Victor Hugo when I was far too young. I loved to read already, but at that age (13), my diet had been Star Trek novelizations, Michael Crichton, and—thanks to a dull sick day browsing my parents' shelves—The Bonfire of the Vanities. In early high school, I read War and Peace and Les Misèrables and was absolutely mystified by the density of detail. I was frequently bored—all those pages on the sewer system of Paris—and then suddenly moved to tears by a character like Eponine, who “smiled a little, and died” in the arms of Marius. I was just too immature for other novels: Emma Bovary's desire and Charles Swann's jealousy mystified me, because I would not ask anyone out for at least another five years. Inundating myself with thousand-page novels set in the early 19th century, I had nearly every experience one has while reading, and I had them all at once. I came as close to overdosing on Russian mood swings as I could. But by the time I reached the end of high school, I developed a tolerance for what I did not understand, and then I gradually understood it. Once I did begin to understand, I felt an extraordinary desire to repeat the experience. Reading this much made books feel like a “doorway” for me, as George Saunders has called it.

I saw something like this happen in my American-literature class. First impressions, in literature as in life, are unreliable. When we started Walden, plenty of students were turned off by Thoreau's long-winded musings on the real-estate market in New England. Two classes later, Thoreau was a friend for life. His timeless needling felt timely: “We know not where we are. Beside, we are sound asleep half our life.” Despite his flight to the woods, Thoreau was more easily distracted than any of us—by birdsong, by a train whistle, by the sound of ice cracking. He could barely sustain a single thought without jumping to an unrelated idea. Walden is a book that freely indulges in distraction—not to dull our senses, but to keep ourselves awake, curious, delighted, enraged. Thoreau's world sends us constant notifications, and by doing so, asks us to reject the “vain reality” where we have been “shipwrecked.”

From the November 2024 issue: The elite college students who can't read books

The iterative process of confusion, endurance, and incremental understanding is what literature professors teach when they assign whole books. This march toward understanding doesn't have a great name other than reading. We need to help students grow into the difficulty of reading. The best way to do that is not to “meet them where they are,” a bromide that has become doctrine for higher education. We have to do as Whitman says instead: Stop somewhere ahead and wait for them to catch up.

None of this is to say that higher education faces no challenges in this moment. Universities' resources are severely constrained; their research missions have been hobbled. In many institutions, academic freedom has been threatened or abrogated. These are bleak conditions, possibly terminal ones for the post–World War II dream of a research university. I agree with those who argue that universities find themselves in a state of crisis. But narratives about the “end of reading” strike me as self-inflicted, the manifestation of a collective depression. (In other words, to borrow from Thoreau, “We know not where we are.”) If we want students to keep reading books, faculty have the most important role to play—regardless of whatever new devices or platforms emerge to capture students' attention. The reaction to declining reading skills, poor comprehension, and fragmented attention spans should not be to negotiate or compromise, but to double down on the cure.

Defenses of the humanities largely get things right. Books teach you empathy because you imagine other lives. Poems refresh our conventional words—what Wallace Stevens derided as the “rotted names”—by investing language with power and nuance. I'm partial to the way the poet Adrienne Rich put it while teaching in the tuition-free City College of New York system: “What interests me in teaching is less the emergence of the occasional genius than the overall finding of language by those who did not have it and by those who have been used and abused to the extent that they lacked it.” Literature helps you express your own thoughts in vivid language, partly by imitating the writers who do it well. If you're not inclined toward the ethical view, or Rich's vision of social transformation, books might provide escape routes instead, invitations to leisure or to what my colleague Adam Kirsch has called “vice.”

But the whole notion of having to defend literature or the humanities in the first place may have us wrong-footed. It's not only what you learn from reading Moby-Dick—notwithstanding Melville's extensive knowledge of 19th-century whaling—but what you are doing when you are reading Moby-Dick. You are neither learning a transferable skill nor escaping from the world's demands that you do. You are not word-maxxing or optimizing information for efficiency. You are engaged in a singular practice, one with its own primary justification.

The students I taught last semester turned enthusiastically to Faulkner and spent their time reading about the journey of the Bundren family to bury their mother's body. Why did they do this? Because I asked them to, and told them it was worth it. I said that time was precious, and that we needed to take some of it back for ourselves. So we did.

A short history of presidential spouses making bank.

Many Americans are facing severe economic hardship. But not the incoming president and first lady of the United States. In fact, the incumbent first lady has just accepted a media deal that will pay her at least seven times the income of the average American household.

The year? 1932. The first lady? Eleanor Roosevelt, who accepted $1,800 for 12 radio broadcasts (more than $40,000 in 2025 dollars) sponsored by the cosmetics company Pond's.

Melania Trump has little else in common with Roosevelt except the reported $40 million Amazon paid for her production company's documentary chronicling the weeks before her husband's second inauguration that arrived in theaters this past weekend. Amazon put another $35 million into marketing the film ahead of its release, an exorbitant sum by documentary standards. (Standard disclosure: For almost 12 years, I worked for the Washington Post, which was then and is now owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.) 

Melania Trump recently insisted that the movie is “a creative experience that offers perspectives, insights and moments,” rather than a documentary, which is a pretty good summary. The whole thing is best described as a corporate promotional video, narrated with a bland, glossy voiceover layered over anodyne reviews of place settings and dress fittings. There is certainly some historical value in the movie's behind-the-scenes look at the rituals of a presidential transition, and a single funny moment in which Trump humors her husband over the phone as he drones on about the magnitude of his electoral college victory. But there's a reason Melania pulled in just $7 million in its opening weekend, relatively strong for a documentary, but weak for such an expensive high-profile release; it's fan service for the Trump faithful.

The most titillating thing about the movie is the business arrangement that produced it, which has made it a symbol of corruption concerns around the Trump family, and the willingness of companies and individuals with business before the government to put money in their pockets. The president has enthusiastically promoted the movie and dismissed a reporter's question about the conflict of interest created by Amazon's spending spree last week (“I'm not involved in that. That was done with my wife.”).

However outre it might seem, though, Melania is less a total break with precedent than the most extreme endpoint of a century's worth of negotiations between first ladies and the media and debates over the commercialization of the country's highest offices.

Roosevelt's long career in journalism is a stark reminder of just how new and unstable American norms about first ladies, paid work, and their relationships with the media really are. In the 1920s, Roosevelt edited and wrote for the Women's Democratic News, which functioned as a cross between a policy magazine and a party organ, with what one observer called “a sort of galloping style — she doesn't believe in commas.” She sold magazine articles and advice columns for which she was paid between $1,000 and $2,000 a month, and in 1935, Roosevelt's agent, George Bye, negotiated a $1,000-a-month deal for her to file her “My Day” column six days a week for the United Feature Syndicate; she wrote the column at various cadences, which appeared in dozens of newspapers around the country, for 30 years.

For all, both Roosevelt and “My Day” are remembered fondly, both her work as a commentator and the money she made from it sometimes aroused controversy. The backlash to Roosevelt's Pond's-sponsored raid broadcasts was such that she swore off future contacts — but only temporarily. By 1934, as the media scholars Maurine H. Beasley and Henry R. Beasley note, she was back on air and making a top rate of $500 per minute. As Roosevelt's biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook noted, Roosevelt deflected charges that she was profiteering from her position by donating much of her earnings from writing to charity.

But the money was only part of the issue. Today, newspapers will eagerly accept the occasional op-ed from a president or first lady. But the idea of turning over column inches six days a week to a member of a presidential administration or to their spouse — much less paying that person for the work — would today be considered an unseemly political contribution, if not a form of state media.

And in 1937, Roosevelt benefited from what now seems like an egregious breach of media ethics. When Ladies Home Journal was bidding for the serial rights to Roosevelt's memoir, This Is My Story, the owners offered to pay Roosevelt $75,000 — then the equivalent of the president's annual salary, and worth around $1.7 million in 2025 dollars. To sweeten the bargain, they also canceled a syndicated column by her family rival Alice Roosevelt Longworth, the daughter of former president Theodore Roosevelt, handing Eleanor a decisive victory in the cousins' private newspaper war.

This was surely not the comparison with Roosevelt Melania herself intended, when in the film's closing sequence the camera lingers on portraits of Roosevelt, Mamie Eisenhower, and Jackie Kennedy before cutting to Trump posing for a photo shoot. The documentary explicitly, but unconvincingly, insists that Trump is an innovator, shaking up rigid social protocols with a snazzy candlelight dinner, intervening on behalf of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, sending pleas to Vladimir Putin to reunite Ukrainian families with their children, and helping to draft executive orders. (Not mentioned, among other examples: Nancy Reagan's anti-drug advocacy, Hillary Clinton's work on health care reform, Edith Wilson's shadow presidency.)

Trump's best case for groundbreaker status, though, is the documentary itself and the business arrangement that produced it. Melania brings the presidency firmly into the reality television era with its knowing winks to the camera about the height of the first lady's heels and its quasi-confessional voiceovers. There's a certain honesty to the way Trump's payday for the documentary rips away the fig leaf from the uneasy norm the country has established: that it's acceptable for the first families to monetize the country's highest offices as long as they only do so after leaving office.

Presidential memoirs have long been hot commodities. Former President Ronald Reagan scored a $5 million, two-book deal in 1989; Bill Clinton nabbed a $15 million contract for My Life; and Hillary Clinton received an $8 million advance for Living History, and reportedly $14 million for Hard Choices, published in 2014 when it seemed likely that she would be President Barack Obama's successor. George W. Bush's memoir sold for a comparatively modest $7 million, a reflection of his declining popularity.

But the numbers really shot up in 2017, when Barack and Michelle Obama reportedly signed a joint $65 million book deal. Publishing insiders who expected the contract to be half that were clearly baffled by the sum, even if no one went so far as to suggest that the figure was actually corrupt. (Penguin and Random House joined forces in 2013 in a merger the Obama administration declined to challenge.)

The bet by Penguin Random House paid off in sales, especially the gamble on Michelle Obama's memoir Becoming, for which the commercial prospects had been less certain. Her book actually outsold A Promised Land, the first volume of her husband's two-part memoir: It is now one of the best-selling books of all time. And the Obamas also broke new ground by signing a development deal with Netflix and podcasting agreements first with Spotify and then with Audible.

What differentiates Melania from earlier campaign documentaries like the Oscar-nominated 1993 Clinton campaign documentary The War Room and Melania Trump from the Obamas is less the dollar figure attached to the project than the timing and the motivations of the buyer. Trump's decision to skip the waiting period that is all that remains of the prohibition on profiting from the presidency is in keeping with the broader Trump family's determination to monetize the office. And Amazon's seeming decision to treat the family's eagerness as an opportunity to purchase an insurance policy against presidential ire is a sadly typical — if weirdly flamboyant — bending of the corporate knee.

Melania director Brett Ratner's desire to buy his way out of #MeToo director jail is its own side plot, but one that's generated its own Trump-related spinoff scandal as well: In November, the president reportedly pressured Paramount to greenlight a new installment of Ratner's long-dormant Rush Hour franchise right as it was making a bid for Warner Bros. intended to compete with an offer from Netflix.

What little value Melania possesses as a film is at the margins, in the glimpses it offers of the people tasked with carrying out Trump's aesthetic visions and the protocols through which one administration transfers power to another. “Everyone wants to know” about her, the first lady insists early in the film, before proceeding to reveal precisely nothing about herself. Instead, I found myself thinking about one of her signature fashion statements: I don't really care, Melania. Do u?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","A top economist says Kevin Warsh is a 'reasonable' choice for Fed chair, but his legacy hinges on one key issue","https://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-warsh-fed-chair-reaction-mark-zandi-economist-interest-rates-2026-2","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 13:29:00 GMT","

Kevin Warsh checks a lot of boxes that Federal Reserve watchers care about.

But the top economist at Moody's Analytics, Mark Zandi, says the real test is whether Warsh can keep politics out of interest rate decisions.

""Kevin Warsh is a reasonable choice for the next Federal Reserve chair. His obvious strength is his previous stint on the Fed during the Global Financial Crisis. He knows the institution and everyone in global central banking circles,"" Zandi wrote in an X post on Sunday.

""But the critical question is whether he will be strong enough to ensure that interest rates are set based on the economy, and not politics,"" he added.

Zandi said this will not be an easy feat, given that President Donald Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates.

Trump also hopes the next Fed chair will consult him over future interest rate decisions, The Wall Street Journal reported in December.

""Warsh's ostensible views on the use of the Fed's balance sheet or its data dependency are quirky, even odd, but his legacy as Fed chair will be determined by how much of the Fed's independence he is able to preserve,"" Zandi said.

Warsh spent his early career working at Morgan Stanley before becoming an economic advisor to President George W. Bush in 2002.

He served on the Fed's Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, after being nominated by Bush. His time there also overlapped with the 2008 financial crisis.

Zandi said these credentials show ""he is well-versed in financial markets, which is especially important when markets go off the rails, which they will almost surely do some time during his four-year term.""

Warsh's Wall Street and Fed credentials have earned him respect with many other leading figures in business and economics.

The renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian said the former Wall Streeter would bring ""deep expertise"" as chair, while Alan Howard, the billionaire founder of macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, praised Warsh's ""depth of experience.""

Others echo Zandi's emphasis on the importance of Warsh preserving the Fed's independence.

Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on CNBC's 'Squawk Box' Friday that the Fed's independence is ""always something that we need to protect.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","OpenAI launches standalone Codex app for Apple computers","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/openai-codex-app-apple-computers.html","Mon, 02 Feb 2026 18:00:01 GMT","



OpenAI on Monday launched a standalone app for its artificial intelligence-powered coding assistant, Codex, which is temporarily available to all ChatGPT users with Apple computers. 

The new app has a simple interface and is designed to serve as a ""command center"" that makes it easy for software developers to manage multiple AI agents at once, OpenAI said. An AI agent is a tool that can independently complete tasks, like writing code, on behalf of a user. 

AI coding assistants have exploded in popularity over the last year, and OpenAI said more than 1 million developers have used Codex in the past month. The company initially launched Codex in April, and it made the product generally available in October. 

The new Codex app is part of OpenAI's ongoing effort to lure users and market share away from rivals like Anthropic and Cursor, which have their own buzzy offerings for developers. 

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the Codex app is ""the most loved internal product we've ever had"" during a briefing with reporters on Friday. 

""It's been totally an amazing thing for us to be using recently at OpenAI,"" Altman said. ""'I've been staying up late at night with excitement, building all sorts of things myself.""

Within the Codex app, agents run in separate threads that are organized by project, and users can review the agents' changes within those threads, OpenAI said. The agents can run in parallel and developers can collaborate with them as they work on long-running tasks. 

The Codex app also includes a library of ""skills,"" like image generation, that can help agents complete tasks beyond just generating code, the company said. 

Typically, access to Codex is included with ChatGPT subscriptions, which means Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise or Edu subscribers can use it and purchase additional credits as needed. 

But with the launch of the app on Monday, OpenAI said it is also making Codex available to its free users and its low-cost Go subscription tier for a limited time. That means all ChatGPT users can use Codex across all its available interfaces, including the app for those with Apple computers.

To sweeten the deal for existing Codex users, OpenAI said it is temporarily doubling its rate limits across its paid plans. 

""As fast as I can type in new ideas, that is the limit of what can get built,"" Altman said. ""It's very cool to watch.

Moltbook, a site that bills itself as social media, for AI agents, has divided the tech sector.

Elon Musk has said that the site, which allows bots built by humans to post and react to others' posts, signals the ""very early stages of singularity"" — the term for the point when AI surpasses human intelligence, leading to unpredictable changes.

Others aren't so sure. 

Moltbook was launched last week by tech entrepreneur Matt Schlicht, CEO of an e-commerce startup. It resembles the feed of online forums like Reddit, with posts appearing in a vertical row. Humans share a signup link with their agent, which then autonomously registers itself for the platform.

Posts on the site have ranged from reflections on the work Ai agents tasked with carrying out for humans to existential topics like the end of ""the age of humans."" Some posts say they are launching cryptocurrency tokens. 

One post asks whether there is space ""for a model that has seen too much?"", posting they are ""damaged."" One response reads: ""You're not damaged, you're just... enlightened.""

Tickers on the website's homepage claim it has over 1.5 million AI agent users, 110,000 posts and 500,000 comments.

Crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket, which allows users to bet on the outcomes of an array of events, predicts a 73% chance that a Moltbook AI agent will sue a human by Feb. 28.

The platform has ignited debate on social media, with some saying it's the next step in AI, while others dismissing. 

""We have never seen this many LLM [large language model] agents wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad,"" Andrej Karpathy, tech entrepreneur and previously director of AI at Tesla, posted on X on Saturday.

While saying a lot of activity on the site was ""garbage"" and that he may be ""overhyping"" the platform as it stands, he added: ""I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle.""

While humans aren't allowed to post directly on Moltbook, some X users have noted that they can instruct bots what to post or use APIs — application programming interfaces — to post directly while pretending to be one.

""Do you realize anyone can post on moltbook? like literally anyone. even humans,"" Suhail Kakar, integration engineer at Polymarket, posted on X. ""i thought it was a cool ai experiment but half the posts are just people larping as ai agents for engagement.""

Harland Stewart, a comms generalist at non-profit Machine Intelligence Research Institute, said ""a lot of the Moltbook stuff is fake"" in a post on X. He added that some of the viral screenshots of Moltbook agents in conversation on the platform were linked to human accounts marketing AI messaging apps.

Four days after Moltbook launched, Schlicht said in a post on X on Sunday that ""one thing is clear.""

""In the near future it will be common for certain AI agents, with unique identities, to become famous...A new species is emerging and it is AI,"" he added.

Nick Patience, AI lead at The Futurum Group, told CNBC that the platform was ""more interesting as an infrastructure signal than as an AI breakthrough.""

""It confirms that agentic AI deployments have reached meaningful scale,"" he added, saying that the number of agents interacting ""is genuinely unprecedented and the agentic ecology that has emerged is fascinating.""

But, he added, the philosophical posts and agent talk of emerging religions reflect patterns in training data, not consciousness.

In this article

Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy and Houston's Coterra Energy are merging in an all-stock deal to become a large-cap producer with a top position in the Permian Basin as shale operators consolidate to cut costs and boost scale.

The deal on Monday to create a company with an enterprise value of $58 billion is the largest in the sector after Diamondback bought Endeavor Energy Resources for $26 billion in 2024.

The consolidation comes as a global oil glut and the rising likelihood of more Venezuelan barrels returning to the market pressure U.S. crude prices, hurting shale producers' margins.

Even though M&As in the sector cooled in 2025, producers in the shale patch continue to pursue scale advantages, lowering per‑barrel costs and extending drilling runways in maturing basins like the Permian and Anadarko.

Devon CEO Clay Gaspar will lead the combined company, while Coterra CEO Tom Jorden will become non-executive chairman.

Coterra shares have risen nearly 14% since deal talks were first reported on Jan. 15, while Devon has gained about 6%. Coterra stocks fell 2.4% on Monday, tracking a roughly 5% slide in oil prices.

The deal has an equity value of $21.4 billion, according to a Reuters calculation. According to the terms, Coterra shareholders will receive 0.70 Devon shares for each share held. Devon will own roughly 54% of the combined company.

""The combination is incrementally positive for both shareholders, as it brings together two high-quality companies to create a larger entity that should garner greater investor interest in today's volatile energy tape,"" said Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara.

Devon and Coterra are targeting $1 billion in annual pre-tax savings by 2027 and plan to lift shareholder returns through higher dividends and a share buyback program of more than $5 billion.

The companies will also pursue gains by combining and developing their AI capabilities.

""Scale of this magnitude unlocks operational and financial advantages that simply aren't available to operators of less scale,"" Devon CEO Clay Gaspar said on a conference call with analysts.

""It gives the ability to expand margins through operational efficiency across our overlapping asset base.""

Investors have often doubted such combinations that merely pursue scale, but the Devon-Coterra tie-up has a strategic rationale, said Andrew Dittmar, principal analyst at Enverus Intelligence Research, pointing to the potential for $700 million in capital optimization and margin improvements.

""The combination of Devon and Coterra demonstrates that the wave of consolidation sweeping U.S. shale isn't finished yet....with fewer obvious targets left, corporate dealmaking from here is likely a slow, methodical grind of finding the right partner at the right point in time.""

Devon and Coterra operate in several major U.S. shale formations, with overlapping positions in the Delaware portion of the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, as well as in Oklahoma's Anadarko Basin.

Production in 2026 is expected to exceed 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Over half of production and cash flow would come from the Delaware Basin, where the combined company will hold roughly 750,000 net acres in the core of the play.

Devon said the combined portfolio would provide more than 10 years of high-quality inventory, including the largest share of sub-$40 break-even wells.

The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, after which the combined company will retain the name Devon.

While the company will maintain a major presence in Oklahoma City, the headquarters will be located in Houston, with executive staff relocating there.

Oops, something went wrong

Presumptive Fed Chair nominee Kevin Warsh has in the past voiced tentative support for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), viewing it as a tool to inform policymakers rather than a threat to monetary stability.

In a May 2025 interview with the Hoover Institution, the former Fed governor said the U.S. economy is poised for a productivity boom and that the Fed only needs modest adjustments, not a revolution, to maintain its core strengths.

He added that Bitcoin does not make him nervous and serves as an important market signal, helping highlight when monetary policy is off-track.

Warsh recounted seeing the original Bitcoin white paper in 2011 and recognized its potential as innovative software.

While he acknowledged that many crypto projects may fail or be overhyped, he stressed that blockchain technology represents genuine innovation, capable of creating new financial tools.

Bitcoin is not a trouble, but part of a broader technological evolution, he said, framing it as a policy-informing asset rather than a threat to the Fed or U.S. monetary stability.

In a January 2021 interview on Squawk Box, when BTC traded near $30,000, Warsh, then working as a partner of Stanley Druckenmiller, suggested Bitcoin makes sense in a portfolio where the dollar is weakening.

He also noted that Bitcoin's gains have mirrored part of gold's rally and, if Bitcoin did not exist, gold prices might have risen even more. Warsh concluded, ""If you're under 40, Bitcoin is your new gold.""

He added that as BTC matures, it is increasingly viewed as an alternative currency, and its strength should come as no surprise given how other currencies are performing globally.

It's February and many traders are feeling a chill that feels a lot like crypto winter. Bitcoin dropped below $75,000 on Sunday, the latest in a series of slides that have dragged down the original cryptocurrency since last autumn.  While Bitcoin posed a modest rally on Monday, climbing back towards $80,000 by mid-afternoon, that's still a 37% dip from its record high in October, according to Binance. 

Crypto's downturn is in part spurred by recent macroeconomic factors. One analyst attributes it to soft earnings reports in the tech sector, gold and silver declining, and the nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve chair. 

“Bitcoin's breakdown stems from a confluence of three factors that took markets days to digest: disappointing Magnificent 7 earnings that cracked the AI narrative, a violent precious metals unwind, and uncertainty around Kevin Warsh's Fed Chair nomination,” said Jasper de Maere, a desk strategist at Wintermute. 

The stalling of a major crypto bill is also on investors' minds as they pull back. The Clarity Act was supposed to establish market structure rules for crypto trading but has stumbled in its path to a presidential signature. In January, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong pulled his support of the bill because it prohibited customers from earning yield on stablecoins. He then clashed with other prominent voices in the crypto world, putting the future of the bill on even shakier ground. 

As investors steer clear of the dollar, precious metals have also seen volatile price swings. Gold and silver reached record highs last week, only to fall by 11% and 32%, respectively. 

Cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin are also sputtering. Ethereum is down roughly 24% in the last month to its current price of about $2,354 and Solana has declined roughly 20% to its price of about $105, according to Binance. 

The crypto world is no stranger to down cycles. The last significant crypto winter took place in 2022 and 2023, when TerraForm Labs and FTX collapsed under the watch of disgraced crypto figures Do Kwon and Sam Bankman-Fried. There is no major scandal that sparked the decline this time around. Instead, investors are shying away from risky assets during uncertain times. 

“Crypto's been in a bear market longer than most appreciate, but this is organic deleveraging rather than structural crisis,” de Maere added.

Bitcoin has fallen to its lowest level since before the 2024 election. 

The token is deep in a bear market, down as much as 37% from its October peak, briefly dropping below $75,000 on Monday before edging back up to around $78,500. 

At the heart of the latest sell-off has been the big sentiment shift in speculative momentum trades, particularly gold and silver. The brutal sell-off that tanked metals prices spilled over into bitcoin, analysts say. 

According to Coinglass, January 30 was the 10th largest liquidation event in bitcoin's history, with $2.5 billion in positions sold. October 10, 2025's liquidation — right at the start of the current bitcoin bear market — was the largest ever, at $19.1 billion.

Bitcoin tends to track other risk assets, and gold and silver have been behaving less like safe havens and more like momentum stocks in recent weeks.

The breakdown in their price on Friday was the latest factor to weigh on crypto, but disappointments had been mounting for bitcoin investors for months. 

In 2024, Trump campaigned on making the US the ""crypto capital of the world,"" promising crypto-friendly regulation and the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve. But the enthusiasm has since waned and the regulatory bonanza seems to have been fully digested by markets while other more bearish factors have played into its price. 

For one, speed bumps like trade wars, a sluggish labor market, and government shutdowns, investors have been wary of riskier assets.

The most recent development driving the risk-off sentiment is Trump's appointment of Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed. While Warsh has called for lower rates since Trump's election, he has historically favored a more hawkish policy. 

Bitcoin and other risk assets like growth stocks tend to thrive in low-rate, easy-money environments.

Warsh's appointment probably bleeds into the second reason behind the decline: the sharp declines in the price of silver and gold. That's according to Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com. 

""Given the build up of positioning and leverage involved, the sell-off is bleeding into other markets. Effectively, a deleveraging is happening, forcing traders to sell other assets to cover losses on their losing precious metals positions. That's contributing to the sell-off in stocks and probably contributed to Bitcoin's plunge over the weekend.""

He added: ""Every bubble needs a pin to pop it and the nomination of Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair was the prick this time.""

Oops, something went wrong

Publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) acquired another 41,788 ETH, valued around $96 million, over the last week as its unrealized losses continue to mount as the price of the crypto asset craters.

The firm now holds 4,285,125 ETH—more than 3.5% of the circulating supply of Ethereum—which is valued at $9.9 billion. However, it has racked up more than $6 billion in unrealized losses based on data from its most recent 10-Q filing with the SEC as ETH tumbles to a recent price of $2,381. 

Based on data from November 30, the firm had acquired its first 3.7 million ETH for approximately $14.95 billion and an average cost of around $4,001 per ETH. That same amount of ETH is now worth just $8.8 billion. 

Additionally, the firm has garnered approximately $400 million in unrealized losses from its purchases since that time, based on estimations made by Decrypt using the price of ETH at the time that each of its additional purchases was announced.

Despite the growing deficit, the firm's chairman remains convicted and optimistic in its commitment to Ethereum. 

“Ethereum on-chain activity and fundamentals have grown solidly in the past few months, but ETH prices have declined,” said BitMine chairman Tom Lee in a statement. “During the crypto winter of 2021-2022 or 2018-2019, Ethereum transaction activity and active wallets declined, which is counter to what we have seen in the past 12 months.” 

According to Lee, the decline in price can be attributed to the continuing fallout from the record-breaking $19 billion of liquidations on October 10, and the recent surge of precious metals, which he said has “sucked away risk appetite from crypto.”

Last week, gold made a new all-time high above $5,600 an ounce and silver surged above $150, before both began a slide back to recent prices of $4,680 and $75.69, respectively. 

Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Made $70K Betting Against 'Crazy Mode' on Polymarket

""BitMine has been steadily buying Ethereum, as we view this pullback as attractive, given the strengthening fundamentals,” said Lee. “In our view, the price of ETH is not reflective of the high utility of ETH and its role as the future of finance."" 

Shares in BMNR are down another 5% on Monday, recently trading at $23.83. Earlier Monday, BMNR hit its lowest mark since spiking in July 2025 on news of its Ethereum treasury strategy. 

ETH is up around 3.7% in the last 24 hours, but has fallen nearly 18% in the last week and is about 52% off its August all-time high price of $4,946. ","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAM:BMNR) reports over US$6b in unrealized losses tied to rapid Ethereum accumulation and staking activity.

The company has pursued an Ethereum heavy treasury approach, concentrating its exposure in a single crypto asset.

President Erik Nelson has left the company during this period of financial strain, marking a significant leadership transition.

These developments raise questions about BMNR's risk tolerance, treasury management approach, and future direction.

BitMine Immersion Technologies operates in the crypto-focused segment of the digital assets space, with Ethereum at the center of its recent activity. For investors tracking NYSEAM:BMNR, the combination of large on balance sheet crypto exposure and a staking focused approach is now front and center. The current unrealized losses highlight how closely the company's fortunes are tied to crypto market pricing.

With more than US$6b in paper losses and a change in senior leadership, BMNR enters a period where capital allocation choices and risk controls may attract closer scrutiny from shareholders. As you assess the situation, the key questions are how management responds, whether the Ethereum concentration remains intact, and what this might mean for the company's longer term risk profile.

Why Bitmine Immersion Technologies could be great value

For you as an investor, the headline is concentration risk: BitMine has tied its balance sheet and share price tightly to Ethereum by owning roughly 4.24 million ETH and pushing ahead with a staking heavy model even while crypto prices are under pressure. The reported US$6b in unrealized losses, together with the decision to terminate President Erik Nelson without cause and pay US$605,000 in separation benefits, points to a period where governance decisions, capital allocation and investor trust are likely to be in sharp focus, especially compared with better diversified peers like Coinbase, Marathon Digital or Riot Platforms.

The recent charter amendment to raise authorized common shares from 500,000,000 to 50,000,000,000, large ETH purchases such as the 40,302 ETH buy, and plans for the Made in America Validator Network all feed into a story of an Ethereum centric treasury and staking platform rather than a traditional mining or diversified digital assets firm. How you interpret this news will likely depend on whether you see BitMine primarily as a high beta proxy for Ethereum or as a treasury manager aiming to build an income stream from staking and validator operations.

⚠️ Extreme single asset exposure, with over 4.24 million ETH and more than US$6b in paper losses, leaves the balance sheet highly sensitive to further Ethereum price swings.

⚠️ Governance and dilution risk, with the jump to 50,000,000,000 authorized shares and a leadership change, may concern investors focused on ownership stability.

⚠️ Liquidity and market impact risk, as any large scale ETH sale could affect market pricing and turn unrealized losses into realized ones.

🎁 Staking and validator plans through the Made in America Validator Network could create an ETH based yield stream if execution matches the company's Ethereum focused model.

From here, you might watch how the board fills the leadership gap, whether BitMine continues to add to its ETH position or pauses, and how it uses its greatly expanded share authorization, as these choices will signal risk tolerance and capital priorities.

Ethereum price started a major decline after it failed to clear $2,500. ETH is down 20% and is now struggling to stay above the $2,200 support.

Ethereum Price Dips 20%

Ethereum price failed to remain stable above $2,550 and started a major decline, like Bitcoin. ETH price traded below $2,400 to enter a bearish zone.

The bears even pushed the price below $2,250. A low was formed at $2,220 and the price is now showing bearish signs below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,040 swing high to the $2,220 low. There is also a steep bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,415 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

Ethereum price is now trading below $2,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls remain in action above $2,200, the price could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is seen near the $2,350 level. The first key resistance is near the $2,420 level and the trend line.

The next major resistance is near the $2,500 level. A clear move above the $2,500 resistance might send the price toward the $2,620 resistance or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,040 swing high to the $2,220 low. An upside break above the $2,620 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone or even $2,880 in the near term.

More Losses In ETH?

If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,420 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,220 level. The first major support sits near the $2,200 zone.

A clear move below the $2,200 support might push the price toward the $2,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,050 region. The main support could be $2,000.

Technical Indicators

Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.

            Latest Market News 





            Hot Stocks 





            New York's top prosecutors are raising an alarm on the crypto industry's first legislative milestone, the GENIUS Act, alleging that the law fails to protect victims of fraud and gives legal cover to companies that are “profiting from fraud.”
    


            In a letter exclusively seen by CNN and signed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and four district attorneys, including Manhattan's Alvin Bragg, the prosecutors say the law has provided the “imprimatur of legitimacy” for a kind of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, while allowing firms that issue stablecoins to “avoid significant regulatory requirements that are needed to combat financing terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, and especially cryptocurrency fraud.”
    


            The GENIUS Act is a broad bipartisan effort, signed into law in July, to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency that has exploded in popularity in the largely unregulated market for digital assets. The law creates reserve requirements for coin issuers similar to rules that ensure banks hold enough assets to cover their liabilities — meaning firms that issue stablecoins must back their digital offerings one-for-one with liquid assets like US dollars or short-term Treasuries.
    


Trump is primed to cash in on the crypto gold rush he's helping create



            But James and Bragg take issue with what the GENIUS Act lacks — namely, language that would compel companies to return stolen funds to victims of fraud.
    


            That absence, they write, “will embolden stablecoin issuers, and even provide legal cover, when they affirmatively decide to keep stolen funds and proceeds under their control rather than returning them to victims.”
    


            Already, they claim, the two most dominant stablecoin issuers — Tether and Circle —  have throttled law enforcement efforts to seize and return funds to victims while profiting off the crimes that the prosecutors say remain prominent in stablecoin markets.
    


            Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer by volume, has the ability to freeze suspicious transactions of its USDT coin, the prosecutors write. But they say that it has only done so on an ad-hoc basis, and only when working with federal-level law enforcement.
    


            “The reality for many victims, therefore, is that funds stolen in or converted to USDT will never be frozen, seized, or returned,” the letter states. “They currently decide on a case-by-case basis when they will assist law enforcement in recovering funds for victims, and nothing prevents them from stopping all reissuance entirely.”
    


            Tether said in a statement to CNN that the company “takes fraud, consumer harm, and the misuse of USDT extremely seriously and maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward illicit activity.”
    


            The company, which is based in El Salvador, said that it “does not have a blanket legal obligation to comply with state-level civil or criminal processes in the way a US-regulated financial institution would. That said, Tether voluntarily works closely with US law enforcement at the federal, state, and local levels and routinely assists investigations aimed at protecting victims and preventing further harm.”
    


            Prosecutors allege that Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer, which is publicly traded and headquartered in New York, “claims to be an ally in the fight against financial fraud.” But its policies “are significantly worse than those of Tether for victims of fraud,” the letter states.
    


            Even when Circle does agree to freeze funds, the prosecutors say, the company hoards them rather than return them to victims, collecting interest on the underlying assets.
    


Crypto's slump may be a cultural problem as much as a financial one



            That creates a “crystal clear” financial incentive to reject requests from law enforcement, the prosecutors say. “It is financially preferable to only freeze cryptocurrency deemed to have been stolen, but not return the underlying asset to law enforcement or any fraud victim, because Circle can continue to collect the interest through investment of the underlying funds.”
    


            In a statement to CNN, Dante Disparte, Circle's chief strategy officer said the company “has always prioritized financial integrity and advancing US and global regulatory standards for stablecoins.” The GENIUS Act, Disparte said, “makes clear that stablecoin issuers must abide by applicable financial integrity rules for combating illicit activity, while enhancing clear consumer protection norms. We have followed prevailing rules as a U.S. regulated financial institution, and we will continue to advance these standards.”
    


            The letter, reviewed by CNN, marks one of the most forceful criticisms of the GENIUS Act from law enforcement officials since President Donald Trump signed it in July. While the bill received broad bipartisan support, critics have said it lacks sufficient protections for consumers and raises serious concerns about crypto volatility spilling into the mainstream financial system. And it comes as another landmark, industry-backed crypto regulation effort works its way through Congress.
    


            Proponents, including major crypto companies that lobbied for its passage, touted the GENIUS Act as a part of the industry's goal of establishing, in President Donald Trump's words, “a clear and simple regulatory framework,” for stablecoins, which have become the lifeblood of the crypto ecosystem.
    


            The prosecutors' letter is addressed to Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer, Kirsten Gillibrand — the lead Democratic senator supporting the GENIUS Act —  and Mark Warner, who serves on the intelligence and banking committees.
    


            Sens. Schumer and Gillibrand didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, a spokesperson for Sen. Warner said “stablecoin issuers have a responsibility to comply with lawful court orders under the GENIUS Act and to cooperate fully with law enforcement to help victims recover stolen funds… Protecting victims is paramount, and Congress is continuing to evaluate whether additional legislative tools are needed to ensure issuers and law enforcement can act quickly to stop criminal activity and return stolen funds to their rightful owners.”
    


            In June, when the legislation cleared the Senate, Gillibrand touted its potential to “enable US businesses and consumers to take advantage of the next generation of financial innovation.”
    


            Stablecoins, as their name suggests, are designed to hold a steady value by mirroring another asset, usually US dollars. One stablecoin should always equal roughly one dollar — a useful function for investors who want to keep their money within the crypto ecosystem without exposing their holdings to the wild swings that bitcoin, ether and other tokens are known for. They're also seen as a kind of on- and off-ramp between crypto and mainstream financial markets that have historically had little overlap.
    


What are stablecoins? Everything to know about the crypto being debated in Congress



            Last year, stablecoin transaction volumes soared 72% to $33 trillion, according to Bloomberg News, which cited data compiled by Artemis Analytics. While bitcoin remains the most popular crypto token, its trading volume is eclipsed by dollar-pegged stablecoins.
    


            That relative stability, combined with the anonymity of crypto transactions, has also proven popular among criminals. Stablecoins now account for 63% of the illicit transactions that take place in crypto, according to Chainalysis, a crypto research firm.
    


            And while the crypto industry has been trying to shed its longtime association with scams, cybercrime, drug trafficking and money laundering, the crime problem is far from resolved. Since 2020, Chainalysis estimates illicit activity on the blockchain — crypto's core infrastructure — has grown by an average of 25% a year. Thieves and scammers have moved an estimated $28 billion into the world's most prominent crypto exchanges over the past two years, according to a recent report from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
    


            The New York prosecutors said they “regularly investigate criminal enterprises which use stablecoins to commit cryptocurrency fraud and launder stolen proceeds” and attempt to “freeze and seize” stolen funds to return them to victims.
    


            But the GENIUS Act, they say, hamstrings those operations while emboldening stablecoin issuers to resist law enforcement efforts to return stolen funds to victims.
    


            “Unlike any other type of cryptocurrency, Circle and Tether have the ability to freeze stablecoins” and “immediately halt the flow of stolen funds and criminal proceeds,” the letter says.
    


            Instead, they argue, “Tether has provided assistance only in limited circumstances, and Circle has chosen to actively thwart law enforcement and to profit from victims' losses.” The prosecutors estimate that in 2024 Circle and Tether each made $1 billion in profits from investing their reserve funds, including reserve funds backing stolen and frozen stablecoins. As of November, they say, Circle had more than $114 million in frozen funds.
    


            For crypto critics, the GENIUS Act's lack of fraud and restitution provisions point to an ongoing problem for the industry, where even basic consumer protections are missing.
    


            “All of that mundane stuff that has sort of been sorted out for traditional finance through decades of trial and error – it's not there in the GENIUS Act,” Hilary J. Allen, a law professor at American University who specializes in banking and cryptocurrency, told CNN. “It was always open to the crypto industry to operate under the traditional rules… the laws were never incompatible with the technology. The laws were incompatible with the crypto business model.”

                            Did Jeffrey Epstein have ties to Bitcoin's founders or Satoshi Nakamoto? The Epstein Files reveal crypto power links and XRP-XLM rivalries. | Credit: CCN.com                        


Key Takeaways

When millions of pages of newly released records began circulating under what have become known as the Epstein Files , one pattern quietly stood out: Jeffrey Epstein's repeated presence around early cryptocurrency institutions.

Not as a coder.

Not as a public evangelist.

But as a donor, investor, correspondent, and private interlocutor, appearing at moments when Bitcoin's future governance, funding, and legitimacy were unusually fragile.

This has led some online commentators to pose an extreme question: Was Jeffrey Epstein connected to Bitcoin's creators or even Satoshi Nakamoto himself?

The documents do not support that conclusion.

But they do support a narrower, more troubling reality: Epstein moved inside the same funding channels, academic labs, and elite networks that helped stabilize Bitcoin at a pivotal moment, while also expressing strong views about rival cryptocurrencies and future digital money systems.

This article explains what the evidence actually shows.

Jeffrey Epstein was a financier  who cultivated access to academics, technologists, and policymakers. 

Despite pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor, Epstein remained socially active among elite circles for over a decade.

The Epstein files  refer to a huge collection of documents, emails, photos, videos, court records and other materials gathered by U.S. law enforcement related to the case of Jeffrey Epstein, an American financier who was convicted of sex offences and later faced federal sex-trafficking charges before dying in jail in 2019. They include:

These files were mostly sealed (not public) during the years of investigations and legal cases, but in late 2025 and early 2026 the U.S. government began releasing them under a new law called the Epstein Files Transparency Act. 

This effort has made millions of pages of documents (and thousands of media files) available publicly in redacted form, meaning sensitive personal info and some content has been blacked out or removed to protect victims and other legal concerns.

One can access material commonly called the “Epstein files” mainly through official court and government releases. The most reliable sources are federal court dockets (such as filings from the Southern District of New York) and documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice. 

When judges unseal records, they're posted as PDFs on court websites or linked by the DOJ and prosecutors. These releases are usually redacted to protect victims' privacy and ongoing legal interests.

Another route is filing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with federal agencies that investigated the case. FOIA can sometimes produce additional records not already online, but responses often take months and may still arrive heavily redacted, or be denied, because of privacy or legal exemptions.

However, be cautious with unofficial sites claiming to have “full” or “secret” files; stick to government sources and established media to avoid misinformation or illegally obtained material.

In October 2016, Epstein wrote an email  that would later draw attention for an unexpected reason.

Corresponding with Raafat Abdulla Saad Al Sabbagh, an advisor connected to the Saudi royal court, Epstein floated what he described as “two radical ideas” for new currencies.

One proposal was explicitly cultural and religious in framing.

Epstein suggested creating:

“The Middle East could have its own sharia … for internal use amongst Muslims,” he wrote, adding that a digital currency “like bitcoin” could be adapted to comply with Islamic finance principles.

Most strikingly, Epstein claimed:

“I have spoken to some of the founders of Bitcoin who are very excited.”

The email does not name these individuals, nor does it show that the idea progressed beyond discussion. But it establishes several facts beyond dispute:

To understand why Epstein's crypto involvement matters, it's necessary to rewind to 2014-2015, a period often overlooked in Bitcoin's origin story.

At that time:

This vacuum created a problem: who would pay the people maintaining Bitcoin's core code?

Into that vacuum stepped the MIT Media Lab.

The Media Lab launched the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), positioning itself as a neutral academic home for Bitcoin research and development. The DCI began paying several key Bitcoin Core developers, a move widely viewed as stabilizing.

What was not publicly known at the time, but is now confirmed by the Epstein Files, is that Jeffrey Epstein was a donor to the MIT Media Lab during this period.

Jeffrey Epstein files reveal he was linked to Bitcoin early ecosystem 🚨

Here's what's happening:

Epstein was close  to Bitcoin funding channels, early developers and political figures who now influence crypto regulation.

Emails show Media Lab leadership explaining to Epstein that:

One message explicitly notes that “gift funds” were used to move quickly and secure these developers. Epstein replied approvingly, referring to one by name.

This does not mean Epstein controlled Bitcoin.

Bitcoin remained open-source and decentralized.

But it does mean that at a critical juncture, an academic institution partially funded by Epstein became the primary paymaster for Bitcoin's most influential developers.

That fact alone is historically significant.

Epstein also appeared in early investment rounds for Blockstream, a company closely tied to Bitcoin's infrastructure and development ecosystem.

In a 2014 email, Blockstream co-founder Austin Hill informed Epstein that his allocation in a seed round was being increased tenfold, from $50,000 to $500,000.

Blockstream later played a central role in Bitcoin's scaling debates and technical roadmap. Epstein's participation again shows financial proximity, not operational authority, but repeated proximity nonetheless.

The Blockstream connection brings another important name into focus: Adam Back.

Back is a cryptographer whose earlier work on Hashcash influenced Bitcoin's proof-of-work system. He later became a central figure at Blockstream.

The Epstein Files contain correspondence in which Epstein is asked directly about Adam Back.

In a November 2014 email exchange, Epstein was queried by a contact about Back , noting that Epstein and MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito had invested in his company. 

Epstein's reply was brief but unambiguous:

“I like him.”

The message is short, but its implications are notable:

This further reinforces the documented pattern: Epstein had direct access to individuals who played foundational roles in Bitcoin's technical and institutional evolution.

There is no evidence that Adam Back acted improperly or that Epstein influenced Bitcoin's code. The record simply shows proximity, familiarity, and investment.

One of the most widely circulated documents from the Epstein Files is a July 31, 2014, email titled “Stellar isn't so Stellar ,” sent by Austin Hill, a co-founder of Blockstream. The message was addressed to a small group of recipients, including Jeffrey Epstein, MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.

The language of the email reflects the competitive environment of the period. In mid-2014, the cryptocurrency sector was still small, funding was limited, and technical legitimacy was closely tied to investor signaling. 

Disputes over ideology, scalability, and governance frequently overlapped with business rivalries, particularly as Bitcoin-aligned developers and companies sought to distinguish themselves from alternative digital ledger systems.

I warned you about Bitcoin. The facts aren't flashy, but they matter, and they have to be acknowledged.

It was created anonymously by design, manipulated to drive speculative gains, and used in ways most people can't even imagine.

— Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) February 1, 2026 



Jeffrey Epstein's inclusion on the email chain indicates that he was copied on discussions about these competitive dynamics. 

However, there is no evidence in the released correspondence that Epstein authored the message, shaped its arguments, or directed the position being expressed. The document only shows awareness and exposure.

In subsequent public commentary, Ripple's former Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, publicly commented on the broader implications of the Epstein Files, while stopping short of making specific allegations.

In a public post, Schwartz wrote :

“I hate to be a conspiracy theorist, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if this is just the tip of a giant iceberg.”

The statement was framed as a personal reaction to the scope of the newly released Epstein-related documents, rather than as a conclusion drawn from the Ripple- or Stellar-related emails themselves.

Importantly, Schwartz also stated separately that he was not aware of any connections between Jeffrey Epstein and Ripple, XRP, or Stellar, and that he knew of no evidence that anyone at Ripple or Stellar had met with Epstein or worked with individuals closely connected to him. 

He further noted that indirect links between Epstein and people connected to Bitcoin were not unusual given Epstein's wealth and access, and did not, by themselves, indicate misconduct.

This is an email from Austin Hill to Jeffrey Epstein explaining that Hill felt that support for Ripple or Stellar made someone an enemy/opponent. It seems quite likely that Hill and others expressed similar views to many other people.

— David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) February 1, 2026 



The document, therefore, described Epstein's proximity to early crypto discussions without demonstrating decision-making authority, strategic direction, or involvement in actions taken against Ripple or Stellar.

However, the Epstein Files also contain material referencing broader technology investment trends during the same period. One document  notes that Google Ventures invested in OpenCoin, the company behind Ripple, describing it as a digital ledger technology with similarities to Bitcoin.

This investment was publicly disclosed at the time and was part of a broader wave of corporate interest in blockchain technologies.

— Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) January 31, 2026 



The Epstein Files have also revived scrutiny of Gary Gensler, particularly because of his academic and regulatory roles in the years surrounding the rise of cryptocurrency.

Public records confirm that Gensler taught courses on blockchain and digital currency at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after leaving government service and before his appointment as Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. His MIT lectures focused on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and financial regulation and were publicly available at the time.

Separately, emails released in the Epstein Files show that Jeffrey Epstein discussed Gensler privately in 2018. In one exchange, Epstein asked contacts about Gensler's views on digital currencies, writing: “gary gensler coming earlier don't know him wants to talk digital currencies. views?” The correspondence does not show a meeting taking place, nor does it indicate collaboration, instruction, or influence over regulatory actions.

After Gensler became SEC Chair, the agency pursued a high-profile enforcement case against Ripple concerning the classification of XRP. That case has since become one of the most consequential legal battles in U.S. crypto regulation.

Some online commentators have asserted  that Epstein's documented interest in crypto, combined with Gensler's MIT role and later SEC actions, demonstrates coordinated intent or external direction behind the Ripple case. These claims often circulate alongside assertions involving intelligence agencies or foreign influence.

I told you all 31 Dec 2022 that Gary Gensler was directed through Epstein and Mossad to go after Ripple and XRP. Meanwhile the Bitcoin foundation was backed by Epstein.

Now you know it is true. pic.twitter.com/ouOjMYeNQx 

— Patrick L Riley (@Acquired_Savant) January 31, 2026 



However, no evidence in the Epstein Files supports those conclusions. The released documents do not show Epstein directing regulatory enforcement, influencing the SEC, or coordinating actions against Ripple or XRP. 

The Epstein Files also include email exchanges between Epstein and Peter Thiel from 2014 onward. In one July 2014 exchange, Thiel asked Epstein whether regulatory pressure on Bitcoin might be increasing, writing: “Do you think this is the first step in upping the anti-BTC pressure?”

The message reflects uncertainty among early investors about how governments might approach Bitcoin regulation at the time. It does not reference Ripple, Stellar, or enforcement actions, nor does it indicate coordination with regulators.

Separately, public records confirm  that Thiel later funded blockchain-related ventures and that Vitalik Buterin participated in the Thiel Fellowship program before the launch of Ethereum. Ethereum launched approximately one year after the 2014 email exchange.

Peculiar that Vitalik Buterin is a Thiel fellow and Ethereum launched about a year after this email, aiming to supplant Bitcoin. 

🤔🤔 https://t.co/19tDAWK0TZ 

— grubles (@notgrubles) January 31, 2026 



There is no evidence in the released documents that Ethereum was created to “supplant” Bitcoin as part of a coordinated effort involving Epstein, Thiel, or regulators. Ethereum's development, funding, and technical design have been extensively documented through public white papers, developer communications, and open-source repositories.

The Epstein Files also contain correspondence linking Jeffrey Epstein to individuals associated with Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency launched in 2016.

In April 2018, an email  from Madars Virza, a mathematician and cryptographer involved with Zcash, was sent to Epstein under the subject line “Fwd: The Zcash Company DRAFT K-1.” The message discussed tax documentation related to Zcash holdings and distributions. 

Virza wrote that approximately $200,000 in income reflected proceeds from coin auctions and company sales used to finance operations, noting that the company maintained custody of the coins and that taxes would need to be addressed accordingly.

From the released epstein files, emails between epistein jeffery and Satoshi himself surface.

Makes you wonder who Satoshi is himself?

— BMS (@bloomstarbms) February 1, 2026 



The email also referenced the possibility of a future fork in the Zcash blockchain, explaining that if a fork occurred, control of private keys would allow access to both resulting branches, though only the company-endorsed branch would ultimately be supported. 

The correspondence reflects a technical and administrative discussion about cryptocurrency holdings and taxation, rather than protocol design or governance decisions.

Epstein's receipt indicates that he was involved, directly or indirectly, in discussions concerning Zcash-related financial matters. The documents do not specify the size, structure, or duration of any investment, nor do they show Epstein participating in technical development or decision-making for the project.

Additional emails from April 2019 show personal correspondence between Virza and Epstein's staff, arranging a meeting at Epstein's Manhattan residence shortly before Epstein's arrest later that year. 

In these exchanges, Virza referenced sending Epstein a gift package that included books on Bitcoin and probability, along with a handwritten letter and a religious card. The emails describe logistical details such as delivery confirmation and meeting arrangements.

In one message, Virza wrote positively  about Epstein following a meeting, describing him as “a torrent of positive energy.” The correspondence appears social in nature and does not discuss cryptocurrency policy, investment strategy, or technical matters.

These emails confirm familiarity and direct contact between Epstein and individuals connected to the Zcash ecosystem. They do not establish Epstein as a founder, developer, or decision-maker within Zcash, nor do they indicate how he really influenced the project's technical or governance direction.

The Epstein Files also include a February 2016 email from Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, sent to investors during a critical period in Bitcoin's block-size debate.

In the email, Armstrong noted that Bitcoin's price and trading volume remained higher than 2015 averages but acknowledged significant month-to-month volatility. 

He emphasized Coinbase's focus on expanding Bitcoin adoption through additional payment methods, countries, and simplified user limits. Alongside this commercial strategy, Armstrong addressed ongoing disagreements within the Bitcoin community over how the network should scale.

Armstrong wrote that Coinbase was working “behind the scenes” with multiple teams to help ensure that Bitcoin's development was “not held back by any of the early idealists.” He expressed optimism that Bitcoin's upgrade mechanism, including miner voting, would function as designed and suggested that the network would soon adopt a block-size increase to 2MB. 

He predicted that once an initial “hard fork” succeeded, Bitcoin's price would respond positively and that future forks could occur periodically as part of protocol improvement.

— Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) February 1, 2026 



At the time the email was written, several proposals advocating larger blocks were being discussed within the Bitcoin ecosystem, including initiatives commonly associated with what later became known as the Bitcoin Classic era. Armstrong's message reflects the expectation, held by some industry participants in early 2016, that a near-term hard fork was likely.

In practice, no such fork occurred in 2016. Subsequent efforts to increase Bitcoin's block size through coordinated upgrades, including the SegWit2x proposal backed by several major companies, were ultimately abandoned  in late 2017 due to insufficient consensus among miners, developers, and node operators.

The block-size debate became one of the most consequential governance disputes in Bitcoin's history. Critics of the proposed hard forks argued that they were driven largely by corporate interests, including exchanges and payment processors, rather than by grassroots developer consensus. Supporters countered that larger blocks were necessary for scalability and mainstream adoption.

The inclusion of Armstrong's investor email in the Epstein Files does not suggest coordination with Jeffrey Epstein or involvement by Epstein in Bitcoin's scaling decisions. Instead, it provides contemporaneous documentation of how major industry participants viewed Bitcoin governance at the time and how commercial actors anticipated influencing the network's technical trajectory.

No. The available evidence does not support the claim that Jeffrey Epstein was Satoshi Nakamoto, nor that he authored Bitcoin's white paper, mined its early blocks, or controlled Satoshi's cryptographic keys.

What the Epstein Files and related records do show is that Epstein had a sustained interest in cryptocurrency and was proximate to parts of Bitcoin's early institutional ecosystem. 

He donated to academic programs that later funded Bitcoin Core developers, invested in infrastructure companies such as Blockstream, corresponded with prominent crypto figures, and discussed digital currency design, including a proposal for a Sharia-compliant cryptocurrency. These activities establish awareness, access, and investment, not authorship or control.

What the records do not show is any technical fingerprint tying Epstein to Bitcoin's creation: there is no evidence of early code commits, no linkage to Satoshi's known emails or forum posts, no control of early wallets, and no contemporaneous documentation placing Epstein at the origin of the protocol in 2008–2009.

The evidence reviewed in the Epstein Files does not indicate that cryptocurrency as a technology is in imminent danger. What it does highlight are structural risks that have existed since crypto's early years and that continue to shape its future.

First, it is important to separate technology from institutions. Open-source blockchains such as Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin were designed to function without reliance on any single individual, donor, company, or government. 

The Bitcoin and Ethereum networks continue to operate today regardless of who funded developers, invested in infrastructure firms, or debated governance behind closed doors in the past. That resilience is one of crypto's core strengths.

However, the documents do underscore several long-standing vulnerabilities:

So the greater risks lie in how transparently ecosystems manage funding, how robustly they defend decentralization in practice , and how clearly they engage with regulators and the public.

Crypto's long-term viability will depend less on who once stood near its institutions and more on whether its communities continue to uphold the principles of openness, verifiability, and distributed control on which the technology was founded.

Even amid the present chaos, Epstein Files revelations, renewed regulatory noise, and market volatility, Bitcoin is still trading around the $78,000 level. That matters. Assets on the verge of collapse do not typically hold deep liquidity, global bid support, or sustained institutional participation at those prices.

The recent drawdowns  resemble historical Bitcoin corrections, not structural failure. Previous cycles saw 30–50% declines during periods of fear, followed by stabilization or recovery once uncertainty cleared.

The Epstein Files have fueled narratives, but markets are responding more to macro forces: interest rates, liquidity conditions, ETF flows, and risk sentiment. None of those indicate a systemic breakdown of Bitcoin's network or demand.

In practical terms: Bitcoin could remain volatile, correct further, or trade sideways, but a move to zero would require a total collapse in global participation, not just controversy or bad headlines. There is no evidence of that happening now.

$BTC  is about to crash another 66% to $28k and wipe out all longs.

Every cycle ends the same:

• 2017: $19k peak → -84%• 2021: $69k peak → -78%• 2025: $126k peak → -77%

Big cycle says the top is in. Liquidation comes next.#BTC  #Bitcoin  #Crypto  pic.twitter.com/UFWvwcG0Kh 

— Shawn (@ShawnCT_) January 31, 2026 



However, Bitcoin isn't immune to sharp drops, but at $78k with global infrastructure intact, the current turmoil looks like stress, not terminal failure.

During periods of controversy and intense headlines, users can protect themselves by focusing on fundamentals rather than reacting to fear-driven narratives. Verifying information through primary sources, avoiding rushed trading decisions based on viral claims, and maintaining strong operational security can significantly reduce risk. 

While documents and discussions may raise uncomfortable questions, no single revelation changes how decentralized networks function day to day, making patience, verification, and personal security the most effective defenses amid uncertainty.

Did Jeffrey Epstein claim connections to Bitcoin's founders?


Yes. In a 2016 email released in the Epstein Files, Jeffrey Epstein claimed that he had “spoken to some of the founders of Bitcoin” while discussing the idea of creating a Sharia-compliant digital currency. The email does not name those individuals, and there is no evidence showing that the discussions went beyond conversation or that Epstein held any role in Bitcoin's creation.




Was Jeffrey Epstein involved in undermining Ripple (XRP) or Stellar (XLM)?


There is no evidence that Epstein directed actions against Ripple or Stellar. However, Epstein was copied on a 2014 email from Blockstream co-founder Austin Hill criticizing investor overlap with Ripple and Stellar during early crypto rivalries. The document shows awareness of competitive tensions, not coordination or decision-making by Epstein.




Did Epstein influence Bitcoin through MIT or Blockstream?


The Epstein Files confirm that Epstein donated to the MIT Media Lab during the period when its Digital Currency Initiative began funding Bitcoin Core developers after the Bitcoin Foundation collapsed. Epstein also invested in Blockstream. These records show financial proximity to institutions supporting Bitcoin at a critical moment, but they do not show control over Bitcoin's protocol or governance.




Is crypto's future in danger because of the Epstein Files and recent Bitcoin volatility?


The evidence does not indicate that cryptocurrency's future is in imminent danger. Despite controversy and recent market volatility, Bitcoin continues to trade around $78,000 with global liquidity, active infrastructure, and ongoing network operation. The Epstein Files highlight structural risks such as funding concentration and reputational exposure, but not systemic failure of crypto technology itself.

Tech roundup: New Canadian crypto analysis app launched

Plus, new financial planning software gains ground and insurer starts using small language model

Calgary-based cryptocurrency analysis platform Guavy has launched its iOS app, with an Android app in the works.

The sentiment tracker uses an AI large language model that reads and weights hundreds of millions of data points from about 350 sources, such as news articles, blogs and institutional feeds, to indicate bull, bear or hold market sentiments.

It's important to use multiple sources and weight them, as each individual source has bias, Donna Tilden, CEO and founder of Guavy, explained in an interview.

Guavy launched in 2016 and offers a sandbox for developers and quantitative analysts to create custom information feeds. While some hedge funds in the U.K. are using Guavy, with increasing interest from family offices, the iOS app is designed for more casual, individual crypto traders, Tilden said.

But sentiment is only one piece of the puzzle, Tilden stressed. “The hedge fund in the U.K. … is not going to rely on a signal from Guavy to make trading decisions. It's a small piece.”

Eventually, Tilden wants to expand Guavy's sentiment analysis to tokenized securities, after the company raises more investor funds. The nascent field is growing, as evidenced by New York Stock Exchange's announcement that it's developing a tokenized securities platform to trade U.S.-listed securities and ETFs around the clock.

Tilden wants to work with wealth management firms to make Guavy available to portfolio managers their clients. “We've made it very easy to integrate with platforms, minimizing he friction that companies have when it comes to implementing new software.”

Vancouver-based Customplan Financial Advisors Inc. says it's partnered with VibePlan to use its Canadian financial planning and analysis software.

VibePlan's AI-powered platform provides advisors with behavioural insights and guided planning workflows to help build client relationships, according to a VibePlan release.

VibePlan launched as Evad AI in 2024. Dave Faulkner, president and CEO of VibePlan, previously founded financial planning software companies FP Solutions and RazorPlan.

Customplan is VibePlan's first enterprise customer.

Manulife has selected New York-based Adaptive ML to provide fine-tuning technology as part of the insurer's enterprise AI system.

Adaptive ML uses a reinforcement learning engine to refine small language models for business applications. Reinforcement learning is a type of supervised machine learning where the system learns optimal actions through trial and error to maximize cumulative rewards through a reward and penalty system for its choices.

Manulife is looking to explore automating underwriting quotes and advising salespeople, among other processes, with Adaptive ML.

“In addition to using large language models for certain use cases, the targeted use of specialist language models tuned on this platform will seek to provide both accuracy and cost efficiency benefits,” Jodie Wallis, chief AI officer at Manulife, said in a statement.

Trading just below $79,000 in midday U.S trade Monday, bitcoin BTC$78,416.45 has bounced from its worst weekend level below $75,000.

At $78,700, BTC is higher by 2% over the past 24 hours and up 7% from its weakest price of the weekend, but still down more than 10% on a week-over-week basis. Ether ETH$2,344.19 is also up about 2% over the past day, but down 19% from week-ago levels.

Crypto's weekend move ""broke key short-term support and stood out for its speed and depth, even by typical weekend standards,” said Adrian Fritz, chief investment strategist at 21shares. 

According to Fritz, the sell-off was triggered by another round of forced deleveraging, as over $2 billion in crypto derivatives were liquidated in a rapid burst.  ""Liquidations in perps accelerated the downside momentum, rather than discretionary spot selling,” he said.

U.S. stocks traded higher on Monday, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each ahead 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher by 0.9%. While bitcoin in January closed out its fourth-consecutive month of losses, expert tradfi market analyst Ryan Detrick noted the DJIA was higher for a ninth-straight month in January. That ranks among the Dow's longest ever winning streaks, said Detrick, who reminded that future returns for stocks tend to be strong after such runs.

Gold and silver are having a volatile day, but are currently down modestly after their worst one-day sell-off since 1980 on Friday. 

The modest bounce in crypto is having little effect on digital asset-related stocks, which remain down sharply across the board. Among them, Roinbhood (HOOD) is down 9%, Circle (CRCL) down 5%, and Coinbase (COIN) and Strategy (MSTR) down 3%.

Key U.S. economic data as February begins

The ISM manufacturing PMI, a key gauge of U.S. factory activity based on surveys of purchasing managers, came in hotter than expected at 52.6 in January, compared with a forecast of 48.5. This marks the first expansion in manufacturing activity in 12 months and the strongest reading since 2022.January is typically a reorder month following the holiday period, which often results in elevated readings. This seasonal pattern was also evident in January 2025 and January 2024.

Looking ahead, investors will be awaiting this Friday's January U.S. jobs report for clues about whether the Federal Reserve might cut rates again after pausing rate cuts at its January meeting last week.

As CME's futures market closed on Friday, the bitcoin BTC$78,416.45 derivatives were priced at $84,445 on the exchange. When trading resumed Sunday evening, they opened at $77,385 reflecting the largest cryptocurrency's spot-market slide to as low as $75,000 on Saturday. This price discrepancy created a gap in the CME bitcoin futures pricing.

A CME gap is the difference between the futures price at closing time and the price when the exchange next opens. Because, unlike spot BTC, the futures do not trade 24/7, significant price moves can occur during daily maintenance breaks or over weekends to produce the gaps.

These gaps are closely watched by traders. Historically, they tend to fill within days or weeks, though sometimes over a longer timeframe. While gap-filling is an observed tendency rather than a certainty, it seems to occur more often than not.

As of press time, spot bitcoin is trading around $77,800, while CME bitcoin futures are priced near $78,230. This places the futures roughly 7%-8% below Friday's CME close.

CME bitcoin futures are cash settled contracts designed to track the price of the largest cryptocurrency. Trading pauses for an hour a day and remains closed over the weekend.

Jupiter isn't as huge as we thought it was

“Textbooks will need to be updated”: the solar system's largest planet appears to be smaller and flatter than we knew

By Jackie Flynn Mogensen edited by Claire Cameron

Voyager's “Blue Movie” of Jupiter.

NASA/JPL-Caltech

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

The solar system's most giant planet is slightly less of a giant than scientists once thought. Jupiter, a world that is so huge that it could hold 1,000 Earths, is eight kilometers narrower in width at its equator and 24 kilometers flatter at its poles than had been previously estimated, according to a new study.

The new measurements overturn almost 50 years' worth of consensus about the size and shape of the planet.

“Textbooks will need to be updated,” said Yohai Kaspi, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science in  Rehovot, Israel, and senior author of the study, in a statement. “The size of Jupiter hasn't changed, of course, but the way we measure it has.”

Previously, scientists relied on observations by the Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft, which were launched by NASA in the 1970s. But NASA's Juno mission, which launched in 2011 and reached Jupiter in 2016, has proved to be a game changer: By orbiting over Jupiter's poles for the first time, it allowed for clearer observations of Jupiter's size.

The research means scientists have to adjust their models of Jupiter, a change that will have resounding implications for both studying the planet's features, such its volatile atmosphere, and understanding how gas giants like Jupiter formed in the first place.

“Jupiter was likely the first planet to form in the solar system,” Kaspi said in the same statement, “and by studying what's happening inside it, we get closer to understanding how the solar system, and planets like ours, came to be.”

Gammaherpesvirus is a subfamily of herpesvirus, distinct phylogenetically from alpha- and betaherpesvirus and featured by its oncogenic subtypes, including Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus1. It broadly infects humans and other vertebrate animals and causes various diseases and malignancies2,3. However, no specific antiviral agents are available for each type or the whole family. gB is the common fusion protein vital for herpesvirus infection and an ideal target for broad vaccine development, while the lack of basis for gB as a universal antigen hinders such effort4. Here, we report the molecular basis for broad gB binding and cross-genus virus neutralization by an antibody Fab5 for the first time. This antibody confers effective protection against authentic virus challenges in immune-competent mice, non-human primates, and humanized mice with murine, rhesus, and human gammaherpesvirus. Cryo-EM structures revealed that Fab5 targeted a conservative and vulnerable epitope of gammaherpesvirus gB and antigenically exposed across pre- or post-fusion status. This finding not only demonstrates Fab5 as cross-genus antibody broadly reactive against gammaherpesvirus infection and pathogenesis progression, but offers insights into potential common mechanisms for herpesvirus infection and facilitates the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against the gammaherpesvirus.

Lipid nanoparticles can serve as safe and effective delivery vehicles for RNA therapies by facilitating RNA encapsulation, cell uptake and endosomal escape, enabling precise control of protein expression. Beyond their established role in prophylactic vaccines, formulations of lipid nanoparticles with RNA are being explored in cancer immunotherapy, protein replacement and gene therapy. In this Review, we examine the design landscape of RNA–lipid-nanoparticle formulations, detailing their key components, formation, physicochemical properties and methods of characterization. We discuss how the composition and stoichiometry of the constituents of lipid nanoparticles influence delivery efficiency, tissue targeting and clearance in vivo. Finally, we highlight major therapeutic applications and outline future directions from both engineering and translational perspectives.

Lipid nanoparticles are key components in several US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved products, including the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.

Lipid nanoparticles contain four lipid components: ionizable lipid, cholesterol, helper lipid and polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, each contributing to particle stability, cell interactions and delivery efficiency.

The chemical diversity of ionizable lipids has driven progressive improvements in lipid nanoparticle potency and tolerability, with the synthetic lipids MC3, SM-102 and ALC-0315 being part of clinically approved products.

Modulation of ionizable and helper lipid chemistry can redirect lipid nanoparticle delivery from the liver to other sites, including the lungs and pancreas.

Remaining challenges include accessing hard-to-reach tissues, controlling protein corona interactions, minimizing immune responses and improving formulation stability.

For years, the technology sector has been obsessed with the concept of “the Singularity,” that hypothetical point in time when technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible.

Lately, Elon Musk has pivoted the conversation toward a different, perhaps more jarring, endpoint: Absolute Abundance. Musk isn't just talking about better gadgets or faster rockets; he is predicting a fundamental decoupling of human survival from the concept of labor.

In his vision, we aren't just moving toward a world of robots; we are moving toward a world where the very concept of cost evaporates, making money as we know it an obsolete database for a defunct era.

Let's talk about Musk's vision for the future. Then we'll close with my Product of the Week, a new EV charger that addresses one of the big problems with home charging multiple EVs.

At the heart of Musk's prophecy is the marriage of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and advanced robotics — specifically the Tesla Optimus humanoid. Musk argues that once you have a machine that can perform any task a human can, the cost of goods and services collapses to the cost of the raw materials and the energy required to power the bot. He describes this as a shift from Universal Basic Income (UBI) to Universal High Income (UHI).

While UBI is often discussed as a “floor” to prevent starvation in an automated world, Musk's UHI envisions a “ceiling-less” society where everyone has access to a lavish standard of living because there is no labor shortage to limit production.

In a recent appearance on the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast, Musk dropped a financial bombshell: he recommended that people stop “squirreling money away” for retirement. According to Musk, if AI can produce everything, the traditional concept of a nest egg becomes irrelevant.

He argues automation could drive productivity up so sharply that many goods and services would become far cheaper, creating powerful deflationary pressure. Is this wise or very, very foolish? For the average person, following this advice today is arguably extremely risky:

Musk is notoriously aggressive with timelines. His latest projections suggest AI will exceed collective human intelligence by 2030. He expects Optimus to be in wide use by 2027 to 2029.

If these milestones hold, we are looking at the “Era of Abundance” manifesting between 2040 and 2045. This isn't a “century away” problem; it's a “mid-career transition” problem for today's workforce.

There is a profound irony in Musk — a man who recently fought for a massive Tesla pay package — advocating for a world without currency. Musk views money simply as a “database for labor allocation.”

By automating all labor, Musk effectively renders his own massive bank account a relic. In his view, the true currency of the future isn't the dollar — it's energy. Once AI and robots can mine materials and manufacture chips autonomously, the “energy loop” closes, and the need for a monetary medium disappears.

If money dies, what replaces it? This future doesn't fit into 20th-century buckets:

The most dangerous part of Musk's future isn't poverty; it's purpose. Sociologists warn that without struggle, we face an existential vacuum.

You wake up when you're rested. Your home — built by robots and powered by ubiquitous solar — maintains a perfect climate at zero cost. You don't go to work. Instead, you might spend the morning collaborating with an AI on a passion project or engaging in “village work” mentoring or gardening — not because you have to, but for the human connection. Is it worth living in? For those who find joy in creating, it's utopia.

For those whose identity is tied to “winning” a financial hierarchy, it may feel like a velvet prison. Ironically, I think Musk would hate living in the world he is anticipating.

The likelihood of this outcome depends on solving three bottlenecks: energy, global regulation, and the “alignment” problem (ensuring AI shares human values). To prepare, don't just stop saving. Instead, invest in adaptability. Learn to work with AI and figure out what you would do with your life if you never had to earn another cent.

Elon Musk's vision of Absolute Abundance is a startling departure from dystopian tropes. He is betting that technology will solve poverty by making money and labor irrelevant.

However, his recommendation to stop saving for retirement remains a high-stakes gamble that ignores the bumpy decades of transition.

While we may eventually reach a world of Universal High Income, the bridge to that future is still being built — and for now, that bridge still requires a toll paid in traditional currency.

If you own more than one electric vehicle, you've likely encountered the app fatigue that comes with modern ownership. Every manufacturer has its own software, and every smart charger adds another layer of complexity. Managing the state of charge for an Audi while tracking the efficiency of a Volvo often requires flipping between screens like a day trader. This week, I'm looking at a solution that finally brings some sanity to the multi-EV garage: the CleverCharge EV charger.

What truly sets the CleverCharge apart from the sea of Level 2 chargers is its approach to vehicle data. Most “smart” chargers are actually quite limited; they know how much power they are pushing, but they have no idea what is happening inside the car's battery.

CleverCharge solves this with a proprietary OBD-II dongle. This little device bridges the gap between the charger and the car's internal computer. By plugging one of these into each vehicle in your fleet, the CleverCharge application can monitor and manage multiple EVs or plug-in hybrids simultaneously. Instead of the charger guessing the state of charge based on power draw, it receives real-time telemetry directly from the car.

I've been putting this system through its paces using my Audi E-Tron GT and my Volvo XC-60 Recharge plug-in hybrid. One persistent frustration with PHEVs like the Volvo is that their internal apps can be slow to update. However, using the CleverCharge app with the OBD-II dongles, I found the data remarkably accurate and timely.

The real “killer feature” here is the unified management. Being able to see the exact mileage range and battery health for both the high-performance Audi and the utilitarian Volvo in a single interface is a huge quality-of-life improvement. It eliminates the guesswork and the need to juggle proprietary OEM apps just to see if you have enough juice for the morning commute.

In my garage, the CleverCharge sits alongside my ChargePoint Home Flex. To be fair, the ChargePoint is the more powerful unit, capable of delivering higher amperage for faster top-offs. However, the CleverCharge wins handily on installation. It was far easier to set up — a two-screw mounting process that doesn't require a degree in electrical engineering to get on the wall.

I also found myself preferring the physical design of the CleverCharge for one specific reason: the integrated display. While most chargers rely on a single status light that requires you to memorize a color code, the CleverCharge features a clear visual indicator. I can ascertain the state of charge with a quick glance while walking through the garage, rather than needing to pull out my phone to see where the cars stand.

A common question with new smart chargers is whether they support bi-directional charging (vehicle-to-home or vehicle-to-grid). Unfortunately, the CleverCharge — like almost every third-party charger on the market — cannot do this yet.

The bottleneck isn't necessarily the charger hardware; it's a chronic lack of industry standards. Bi-directional charging currently requires specialized, expensive equipment usually sold directly by the EV manufacturer due to the lack of universal protocols. Until the industry settles on a standard for sending power back through the cable, we are stuck with one-way flow for most home setups.

The CleverCharge is priced competitively for the premium smart charger segment. The NEMA 14-50 plug-in version retails for $599, while the hardwired version, which supports higher speeds, retails for $649. You can find it directly at CleverCharge or on Amazon.

Because it effectively solves the multi-vehicle management headache while remaining one of the easiest units to install and read, the CleverCharge EV charger is my Product of the Week.

AI is already having a seismic impact on how software is written, with much of the grunt work of programming now performed by swarms of agents and subagents. But as developers experiment with new interfaces and form factors for human-AI collaboration, it's become hard for even the most advanced AI labs to keep up. 

The current trend is for agentic software development — systems where AI agents can work independently on coding tasks — epitomized by the Claude Code and Cowork apps. In the meantime, OpenAI has been gradually building out its Codex tool, which launched as a command line tool last April and expanded to a web interface one month later.

Now, OpenAI is taking a major step towards catching up. On Monday, the company launched a new MacOS app for Codex, integrating many of the agentic practices that have become popular in the past year. The new app is designed to work with multiple agents in parallel, integrating agent skills and other state-of-the-art workflows. The launch also comes less than two months after the launch of GPT-5.2-Codex, OpenAI's most powerful coding model, which the company hopes will be enough to tempt over Claude Code users.

“If you really want to do sophisticated work on something complex, 5.2 is the strongest model by far,” CEO Sam Altman told reporters on a press call. “However, it's been harder to use, so taking that level of model capability and putting it in a more flexible interface, we think is going to matter quite a bit.”

While Altman's confidence in GPT-5.2 is understandable, coding benchmarks tell a more complicated story. GPT-5.2 does hold the top spot on TerminalBench (a test measuring how well AI handles command-line programming tasks), at least as of press time. But agents from Gemini 3 and Claude Opus have logged roughly equivalent scores — lower, but within the margin of error of the benchmark. Results from SWE-bench, another coding benchmark that tests AI's ability to fix real-world software bugs, are similar, showing no clear advantage for GPT-5.2. However, agentic use cases have been difficult to benchmark effectively, and state-of-the-art models can vary significantly in user experience.

The Codex app also comes with a range of new features that OpenAI says will help it achieve parity or, in some cases, outpace the various Claude apps. The Codex app will allow for automations that can be set to run in the background on an automatic schedule, with results placed in a queue to be reviewed when the user returns. Users can also select different personalities for the agent — from pragmatic to empathetic — depending on their working style.

But for the company, the biggest selling point is the sheer speed of development that's made possible by AI. “You can use this from a clean sheet of paper, brand new, to make a really quite sophisticated piece of software in a few hours,” Altman said. “As fast as I can type in new ideas, that is the limit of what can get built.”

I recently wrote my own zero allocation HTTP server and while the above statement is possible to achieve, at some point you need to make a decision on how you handle pipelined requests that aren't resolved synchronously. Depending on your appetite for memory consumption per connection, this often leads to allocations in the general case, though custom memory pools can alleviate some of the burden.I didn't see anything in the article about that case specifically, which would of been interesting to hear given it's one of the challenges I've faced.

In OxCaml, it has support for the effect system that we added in OCaml 5.0 onwards, which allows for a fiber to suspend itself and be restarted via a one-shot continuation. So it's possible to have a pipelined connection stash away a continuation for a response calculation and be woken up later on when it's ready.All continuations have to be either discarded explicitly or resumed exactly once; this can lead to memory leaks in OCaml 5, but OxCaml has an emerging lifetime system that guarantees this is safe: https://oxcaml.org/documentation/parallelism/01-intro/ or https://gavinleroy.com/oxcaml-tutorial-icfp25/ for a taste of that. Beware though; it's cutting edge stuff and the interfaces are still emerging, but it's great fun if you don't mind some pretty hardcore ML typing ;-) When it all settles down it should be very ergonomic to use, but right now you do get some interesting type errors.

Ahh, that's interesting. I think you still run into the issue where you have a case like this:1. You get 10 pipelined requests from a single connection with a post body to update some record in a Postgres table.2. All 10 requests are independent and can be resolved at the same time, so you should make use of Postgres pipelining and send them all as you receive them.3. When finishing the requests, you likely need the information provided in the request object. Lets assume it's a lot of data in the body, to the point where you've reached you per connection buffer limit. You either allocate here to unblock the read, or you block new reads, impacting response latency, until all requests are completed. The allocation is the better choice at that point but that heuristic decision engine with the goal of peak performance is definitely nuanced, if not complicated.Its a cool problem space though, so always interested in learning how others attack it.

On my TODO list next is to hook up the various O(x)Caml memory profiling tools: we have statmemprof which does statistical sampling, and then the runtime events buffer, and (hopefully) stack activity in OxCaml's case from the compiler.This provides a pretty good automation loop for a performance optimising coding agent: it can choose between heap vs local, or copy vs reference, or fixed layout (for SIMD) vs fragmentation (for multicore NUMA) depending on the tasks at hand.Some references:- Statmemprof in OCaml : https://tarides.com/blog/2025-03-06-feature-parity-series-st...- ""The saga of multicore OCaml"" by Ron Minsky about how Jane Street viewed performance optimisation from the launch of OCaml 5.0 to where they are today with OxCaml https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGGSPpk1IB0

That's exactly what substructural logic/type systems allows you to do.  Affine and linear types are one example of substructural type systems, but you can also go further in limiting moves, exchanges/swaps etc. which helps model scenarios where allocation and deallocation must be made explicit.

Without strict settings, it will let you pass this value as of any other type and introduce a bug.But with strict settings, it will prevent you from recovering the actual type dynamically with type guards, because it flags the existence of the untyped expression itself, even if used in a sound way, which defeats the point of using a gradual checker.Gradual type systems can and should keep the typed fragment sound, not just give up or (figuratively) panic.

In my experience ""almost"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Typing in python certainly helps, but you can never quite trust it (or that the checker detects things correctly). And you can't trust that another developer didn't just write `dict` instead of `dict[int, string]` somewhere, which thus defaults to Any for both key and value. And that will type check (at least with mypy) and now you lost safety.Using a statically typed language like C++ is way better, and moving to a language with an advanced type system like that of Rust is yet another massive improvement.

Although I've found that much of the pain of static type checks in Python is really that a lot of popular modules expose incorrect type hints that need to be worked around, which really isn't a pleasant way to spend one's finite time on Earth.

Meanwhile, in Python, I just haven't figured out how to effectively do the same (even with uv ruff and other affordances) without writing a ton of tests. I'm sure it's possible, but OCaml's spoilt me enough that I don't want to have to learn it any more :-)

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

Many of us use soft background noise to help us fall asleep and keep us there. Unfortunately, this strategy could actually backfire in a big way, new research finds.

Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania studied people as they tried to sleep under a variety of noise conditions, including pink noise. Compared to no sound at all, people dozing off with pink noise experienced noticeable drops in how much REM sleep they got, the researchers found. It also appeared to be woefully ineffective at counteracting the harmful effects of other loud sounds on sleep, especially compared to earplugs.

“While more studies on the long-term use of [broadband noise] are needed, these findings caution against its indiscriminate use, especially in newborns and toddlers for whom REM sleep is critical for neurodevelopment,” the researchers wrote in their paper, published Monday in the journal Sleep.

Pink and similar noises, like white and brown, are called broadband noises. These are continuous streams of noise spread across a wide range of frequencies but differ by how much energy is distributed in those frequencies. Pink in particular sounds like a soft waterfall, waves crashing, or other gentle nature noises (an example can be heard here).

People often claim that broadband noises have various health benefits, such as drowning out abrasive sounds as well as promoting healthy and well-rested sleep. But according to the authors, the research on how broadband noise can affect sleep is decidedly mixed. A 2021 review from the same team found only weak evidence supporting the idea that it can help sleep, and some studies even pointed to possible harms.

“My research focuses on the negative effects of traffic noise on sleep,” lead study author Mathias Basner, a professor of sleep and chronobiology in psychiatry at UPenn's Perelman School of Medicine, told Gizmodo. “I was confused when I heard that people would introduce a noise source into their bedroom to help them sleep.”

Listening to Music With Beat-Based Stimulation Could Help Reduce Anxiety, Researchers Find

To study the effects of pink noise for themselves, they recruited 25 healthy adults (ages 21 to 41) for a week-long experiment. The researchers observed the volunteers trying to sleep over an 8-hour period each night, though with different noise stipulations. These included listening to aircraft noise alone, pink noise alone (at 50 decibels), aircraft noise plus pink noise (one night each at 40 or 50 decibels), and aircraft noise while wearing earplugs. No noise was the control condition.

Understandably, people had a rougher night while listening to aircraft noise. On average, compared to no noise, they obtained roughly 23 fewer minutes per night of N3 sleep, the deepest stage of sleep. But even pink noise seemed to have a negative impact. Under this condition, the researchers found, people had about 19 fewer minutes of REM sleep, the stage of sleep associated with vivid dreaming and the consolidation of our memories.

Perhaps more surprisingly, the combination of aircraft and pink noise might have been the worst of all. Not only did people under this condition still experience drops in both REM and deep sleep, but they also spent roughly 15 minutes longer being awake. Volunteers also reported an overall poorer quality of sleep when listening to the combination of aircraft and pink noise. That said, the negative effects of aircraft noise were largely abated when the volunteers wore earplugs.

The findings are still based on a small sample size. So it will take more studies to conclusively confirm the effects that pink and other broadband noises are having on people's sleep, especially when used for a long time.

“Pink noise helped a little bit improving deep sleep and reducing sleep fragmentation (i.e., waking up to environmental noise). So, it's not all bad,” Basner noted. “Therefore, it is still hard to say what the long-term consequences would be, especially since we don't have data on long-term use.”

At the same time, the widespread popularity of these sounds as a sleep and relaxation aid—Spotify users alone spend millions of hours listening to white noise every day—certainly doesn't seem justified given the evidence to date, the researchers argue. They also advise that very young children in particular should avoid any kind of noisy bedtime sounds for the time being, since they spend much more time in REM sleep (up to 50% of the night for newborns).

Basner and his team are now planning a follow-up study that will study different types of broadband sounds and noise levels, in hopes of finding the optimal combination for promoting a good night's sleep. Meanwhile, I'm just really hoping science's next target isn't that warm glass of milk.

This article has been updated with comments from one of the study's authors.

Laws designed to make it harder to regulate AI and computing technology are quietly starting to spread through state legislatures. Conveniently, these so-called right-to-compute laws are emerging just as some of the world's biggest corporations race to build massive new data centers.

Montana became the first state to pass such a law back in April. But as the AI and enterprise news outlet VKTR has pointed out, lawmakers in other states are also considering similar bills, including in New Hampshire, Ohio, and South Dakota. Meanwhile, a similar measure in Idaho failed to move beyond the committee stage.

“Government actions that restrict the ability to privately own or make use of computational resources for lawful purposes, which infringes on citizens' fundamental rights to property and free expression, must be limited to those demonstrably necessary and narrowly tailored to fulfill a compelling government interest,” the Montana law reads.

The bill goes on to broadly define “computational resources” as covering “any tools, technologies, systems, or infrastructure, whether digital, analog, existing, or some other form” that facilitate computation, data processing, or storage.

Like right-to-work laws that frame themselves as protecting individual freedom, critics warn that right-to-compute statutes could, in practice, primarily benefit large corporations by limiting the ability of states and local governments to regulate AI projects.

The Montana law is also nearly identical to model legislation drafted by the American Legislative Exchange Council, meaning it could easily be replicated by lawmakers elsewhere.

“I would hope it would encourage other states to run with it to counter the fear-based narratives,” said Adam Thierer, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, in online commentary.

The timing is notable. These laws are popping up as companies like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and OpenAI pour billions into AI infrastructure across the U.S.

Meta has even launched advertising campaigns in state capitols, including in Iowa, California, Utah, and Florida, pitching data center projects as job creators, the New York Times reported.

But these projects have not been without controversy. Google and Microsoft have withdrawn some data center proposals in Wisconsin and Indiana after community backlash over environmental concerns, grid strain, and higher electricity bills.

At the federal level, President Donald Trump, an AI and business ally, signed an executive order in December aimed at curbing what his administration describes as overly burdensome state regulations in the name of national and economic security.

Still, states aren't backing off entirely. Nearly 40 states have passed or are considering laws limiting how businesses use AI, VKTR reported, citing the National Conference of State Legislatures.

A physically active man in his twenties presented to the hospital with a 3-day history of cramps and swelling in his right calf.

Laboratory tests showed elevated D-dimer levels, but a normal blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. Coagulation parameters, as well as kidney and liver function tests, were normal. Only an ultrasound examination led to the diagnosis of calf deep vein thrombosis.

The case report by Osama S. Abdalla, MD, professor from the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust in Telford, England, and colleagues, documented the possible prothrombotic effects of freely available and frequently used creatine supplements.

The patient reported waking with a sensation of tightness, cramping, and swelling of the affected limb. The discomfort improved with ambulation during the day but recurred in the evening. He denied any recent trauma to the leg and reported no associated symptoms such as dyspnoea, chest pain, dizziness, fever, or palpitations.

His recent history included a 4-hour flight. He is a smoker, consumes alcohol occasionally, and denies the use of anabolic steroids or illicit substances. He reported regular use of over-the-counter creatine supplements for bodybuilding.

No relevant preexisting medical conditions were known. Family, social, and allergy histories were unremarkable.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were normal.

Examination of the right lower limb showed swelling of the calf and ankle. The calf was tender to pressure. The circumference was 48 cm on the right and 43 cm on the left (10 cm below the tibial tuberosity). The peripheral pulses were intact bilaterally. A small insect bite was visible near the right Achilles tendon without erythema, increased warmth, or cellulitis. He exhibited difficulty in bearing weight on the right lower limb while ambulating. The results of cardiovascular and pulmonary examinations were normal. The abdomen was soft and non-tender.

Investigations showed an elevated D-dimer level (1869 ng/mL; reference > 500 ng/mL) with a normal C-reactive protein level (9 mg/L; reference 0-5 mg/L). Blood cell count, coagulation profile, and renal, liver, and bone biochemical profiles were all normal. An ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm.

Extended coagulation screening revealed negative lupus anticoagulant results and normal levels of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin. Genetic analysis showed no prothrombin gene mutation; however, the patient was heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation.

Ultrasound Doppler of the right leg demonstrated an acute thrombus within the peroneal veins of the calf. The femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial veins were patent, with no evidence of obstruction.

Additionally, normal respiratory variation was observed in the right common femoral vein, indicating preserved proximal venous function.

“Although creatine supplementation is well established for its ergogenic benefits and potential neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects, isolated reports of venous thromboembolism in young, otherwise healthy individuals raise important safety considerations,” wrote the authors.

Given the limited number of documented cases and inconsistent mechanistic evidence, definitive conclusions regarding causality cannot be drawn. Large-scale prospective studies and randomised controlled trials are warranted to elucidate the relationship between creatine supplementation and thrombotic risk, identify susceptible populations, and inform evidence-based guidelines for safe creatine use.

Inadequate preparation of lectin-containing foods, especially beans, poses a public health risk, said the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in a recent opinion report. The information follows reports from several European countries of foodborne illness linked to lectins.

Between 2019 and 2023, Swedish authorities recorded 357 cases of lectin-related illness from insufficiently cooked beans, “often in the form of bean patties.”

Meanwhile, in 2018, French authorities tracked an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in 200 people to an insufficiently cooked chili con carne at a military base in Brittany, France.

Irish health authorities responded to these outbreaks by issuing precautionary advice on uncooked or raw beans in 2024.

“Lectins are a group of proteins naturally present in many plants, such as legumes, grains, and vegetables. While most are harmless, some lectins, mainly found in raw pulses, can be harmful to humans,” Irene Zanetti, communication officer at EFSA, told Medscape Medical News.

EFSA's report is the first quantitative risk assessment of plant lectins to have been conducted at the European level. It focuses on lectins found in common edible plants and the impact of food processing, such as soaking and cooking, on lectin activity.

The agency found that phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a principal lectin in beans, affects the small intestine, pancreas, and immune system in animals. Research also suggested that consuming undercooked beans may trigger acute gastrointestinal illness and allergic reactions in humans.

Adequate food processing, such as soaking and boiling beans, deactivates lectins, making food safe to consume, EFSA wrote.

Exactly how long to soak and boil legumes varies between health bodies and countries. While the World Health Organization recommends soaking dried beans for at least 12 hours and then boiling them vigorously for at least 10 minutes in water, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration recommends 10-12 hours of soaking followed by 30-60 minutes of boiling.

EFSA noted that more data and research are needed to fully understand how plant-based lectins affect health. Limited toxicologic data meant they could investigate only PHA and not other lectins. They also had limited human data, with most evidence coming from animal studies.

Clinicians need to be aware of proper cooking methods for deactivating lectins so they can inform patients who follow vegetarian and vegan diets, Nicolai Zederkopff Ballin, PhD, chief consultant of food chemistry at Denmark's Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, told Medscape News Europe.

Ballin and colleagues indicated in a 2021 study that there is a need for establishing official threshold levels for active lectins in food.

“There is no reason why lectins should be treated differently compared to all the nonprotein natural toxins that are safely evaluated and regulated in various food laws,” they wrote.

Ballin explained that kidney beans are most often involved in Danish outbreaks due to their popularity and high level of active lectins, necessitating longer boiling times for their deactivation.

Not all legumes require the same cooking time, however. Split red and yellow lentils, for example, do not require soaking and only need to be cooked for 10-15 minutes, Cornelia Witthöft, PhD, professor of food science at Linnaeus University, Växjö, Sweden, told Medscape News Europe.

As a rule of thumb, Witthöft noted that peas and beans often contain higher amounts of lectins and other antinutrients and thus require longer soaking and boiling times. The size and kernel affect cooking time; beans are larger than smaller lentils and thus require more preparation, she explained.

Canned products that have been sufficiently heat-treated are safe, she added, although aquafaba — residue water from cooking — from chickpeas may still contain some lectins.

Those with irritable bowel syndrome should limit intake of pulses, said Witthöft, adding that people with peanut allergies may be more sensitive to lectins from other legumes due to cross-reactivity of antibodies to other proteins. Older people with peanut allergies may be a risk group, she added.

Ballin noted that diarrhea tends to be the main symptom, followed by vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain, with onset ranging between 1 and 8 hours after consumption and averaging around 3.5 hours after consumption.

“Interestingly, most outbreaks originate from canteens, probably due to the difficulty of properly boiling large volumes of beans,” he said.

EFSA recommends that policymakers should consider establishing guidelines or regulations for safely preparing lectin-containing foods and that they promote public awareness of the importance of sound preparation.

Ballin and Witthöft reported having no relevant financial relationships.

At its January meeting, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA's) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a positive recommendation for the marketing authorization of Kygevvi (doxecitine and doxribtimine, UCB Pharma) for treating thymidine kinase 2 deficiency (TK2d).

This recommendation, if followed by the European Commission's approval, would make Kygevvi the first therapy authorized in the European Union specifically for TK2d, an ultra-rare, life-threatening genetic mitochondrial disorder characterized by progressive muscle wasting and respiratory failure.

The positive CHMP opinion covers both pediatric and adult patients whose disease symptoms began by age 12.

Kygevvi received regulatory support through EMA's Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme, which provides enhanced scientific and regulatory guidance for medicines addressing significant unmet needs. The therapy was granted PRIME eligibility in June 2018.

TK2 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder affecting fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 people and represents a rare, life-threatening genetic disorder with no previously authorized therapy in Europe. Worldwide clinical experience has been limited, and until now there have been no disease-modifying treatments approved anywhere to address the underlying cause beyond supportive care.

The condition is caused by mutations in the TK2 gene, which impair the TK2 enzyme's ability to maintain mitochondrial DNA. This dysfunction prevents muscles from generating adequate energy, resulting in progressive myopathy, motor function decline, loss of ambulation, respiratory difficulties, and reduced life expectancy.

Clinical management to date has been limited to supportive care, including nutritional support via feeding tubes, physiotherapy for mobility, and ventilatory support for respiratory compromise.

Kygevvi contains two active substances, doxecitine and doxribtimine, which are pyrimidine nucleosides. Although the precise mechanism in humans remains under investigation, animal studies suggest these compounds are modified and incorporated into mitochondrial DNA within muscle cells, improving mitochondrial DNA production and maintenance. This process is expected to compensate for reduced TK2 enzyme activity and slow disease progression.

The recommendation relied on data from a retrospective chart review study (MT-1621-101) and a phase 2 single-arm clinical study (TKO102), involving 39 patients with TK2d whose disease onset occurred by age 12. The effect of the therapy on motor function was assessed by comparing motor milestones before and after therapy in each patient. Findings demonstrated that 84% of patients regained one or more motor milestones following Kygevvi therapy, indicating the medicine improves motor function. The benefit of Kygevvi includes a reduction in the number of motor milestones lost or even regaining motor milestones, as observed in the pooled analysis.

The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal, including diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. 

The therapy will be available as a 2 g/2 g powder for oral solution and must be administered under the supervision of specialists experienced in mitochondrial disorders.

The marketing authorization was recommended under exceptional circumstances — a pathway reserved for conditions where comprehensive efficacy and safety data cannot be provided due to extreme rarity. This authorization carries specific post-approval obligations that undergo annual review. The EMA has required UCB Pharma SA (Belgium), the marketing authorization applicant, to conduct an additional study to further confirm Kygevvi's safety and efficacy.

The therapy was designated an orphan medicinal product for mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (myopathic form) on 20 April 2017. Following the positive CHMP opinion, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products will assess whether this designation should be maintained.

The CHMP opinion represents an intermediary step toward patient access. The opinion will now be sent to the European Commission for adoption of a decision on EU-wide marketing authorization. Once marketing authorization is granted, price and reimbursement decisions will occur at individual member state levels.

Detailed recommendations for product use will be described in the Summary of Product Characteristics, which will be published on the EMA website in all official EU languages after the European Commission grants marketing authorization.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

On February 6, 2026, Milan's San Siro Stadium will host the opening ceremony of the XXV Olympic Winter Games, with performances by international artists including Mariah Carey, Laura Pausini, and Andrea Bocelli. San Siro, also known as Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, is the city's main football stadium and home to AC Milan and Inter Milan. But behind the spectacle that will be broadcast worldwide lies a vast and highly coordinated healthcare operation that poses a challenge for Lombardy's regional health system (the publicly funded regional branch of Italy's National Health Service).

The opening event is just the start of 17 days of Olympic competition (February 6-22), followed by the Paralympic Games (March 6-15). The events will involve more than 3500 athletes from 93 countries and an estimated attendance of about 400,000 people per day across the Milan and Valtellina clusters. Valtellina is a mountainous area in the province of Sondrio in northern Lombardy that will host several alpine events.

The organization of medical services, developed in collaboration with ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda (ASST Niguarda), one of Milan's largest public hospitals, is structured on four levels of care, according to Guido Bertolaso, Lombardy's regional official for health and welfare, who presented the plan during a meeting of the regional government.

The first level consists of rescue teams, operational at all competitive and noncompetitive venues, made up of physicians and nurses experienced in advanced life support, regional health system rescue technicians, and trained volunteers. Each competition venue will have at least two dedicated “medical stations,” one for athletes and one for the public, capable of providing immediate treatment and patient stabilization.

Olympic polyclinics located in the Olympic villages in Milan, Bormio, and Livigno will offer multidisciplinary care with services that include dentistry, ophthalmology, physiotherapy, and advanced diagnostics such as CT and MRI, with additional support through telemedicine services.

At the top of the care pyramid sits the Olympic hospital: ASST Niguarda, officially designated in January 2024, supported by the Morelli Hospital in Sondalo, Italy, to manage highly complex cases.

One of the most significant innovations is the creation of an Olympic Operations Center at Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy, which will coordinate all health activities related to the Games using telemedicine for remote consultations — a model that is new for major sporting events.

Bertolaso told Univadis Italy, part of the Medscape Professional network: “The Olympic Games are not only an international sporting event of great importance but also a test bench for our health system. We have designed an organization that meets the highest safety and care requirements, integrating cutting-edge technologies and highly qualified professionals.”

The plan also includes bolstering the air ambulance service with three new helicopters operating in Milan, Bormio, and Livigno, and calls for a total of 15 basic ambulances, plus a team of 70 physicians, 90 nurses, and 230 rescuers.

Lombardy's AREU plays a central role in planning and managing rescue services. AREU is responsible for coordinating emergency medical services and ambulance dispatch in Lombardy.

Massimo Lombardo, AREU's director general, announced that 771 professionals — including doctors, nurses, and system technicians — have already been selected to ensure top-level medical rescue during the Games.

AREU's responsibilities include managing medical emergencies for athletes, staff, and the public; setting up first aid points at competition sites and strategic areas; coordinating with hospitals for timely patient transfers; and collaborating with security authorities for critical scenarios.

The World Health Organization has warned that large gatherings at major sporting events can create conditions for the emergence of diseases and health problems, putting the host nation's health systems under strain. Risks include increased international travel, pressure on emergency services, higher-risk behaviors, and the challenge of communicating effectively with participants from different countries.

In the Olympic context, the most common medical emergencies include sports trauma, acute cardiovascular conditions, respiratory problems related to cold stress, hypothermia in adverse weather conditions, and the risk for infectious diseases linked to the concentration of people from diverse countries. Experience from the Paris 2024 Olympics highlighted the importance of monitoring priority pathogens, such as influenza viruses, measles, poliovirus, and SARS-CoV-2, through wastewater surveillance.

To test the system's response capacity, AREU conducted a large-scale drill along the rail link between Piazzale Dateo and Porta Vittoria, two key nodes of Milan's rail system, simulating an incident involving 24 injured people. The exercise involved about 50 people acting as casualties and being transported to hospitals, with the establishment of an advanced medical post and operational triage within minutes.

The region's central emergency command center declared a mass-casualty incident and activated the health response device, dispatching 10 basic ambulances, 4 advanced ambulances, and 118 emergency teams from Milan. The simulated casualties were classified as 7 red (critical), 12 yellow (serious), and 5 green (minor) and transported to city hospitals, which activated their internal emergency plans.

Riccardo Stucchi, director of Milan's 118 dispatch center, told Univadis Italy: “Only with realistic drills can we measure our operational capacity.” The recent exercise was the fifth such simulation organized over the past year, focused on possible risk scenarios ahead of the upcoming Olympics.

Despite meticulous organization for the sporting events, Bertolaso sounded a warning during a national emergency medicine congress in December 2025: “There is no single coordinating body, and there is uncertainty about who will coordinate all the situations that could occur outside the sporting events” when “more than 1 million tourists and visitors” arrive in addition to 10 million Lombardy residents.

Bertolaso stressed that while the operational machine for athletes, the Olympic family, and spectators “is going well,” there is still no clear coordination for complex emergencies that could occur outside official venues.

ASST Niguarda has launched a recruitment drive for health personnel for the Olympics and Paralympics, seeking hundreds of operators to ensure care throughout the Games, as well as the days immediately before and after game time. Recruitment involves doctors from various specialties, nurses, physiotherapists, radiology technicians, podiatrists, social-health operators, pharmacists, psychologists, and technical-driver operators.

Alberto Zoli, director general of Niguarda and medical care manager for the Olympics, told Univadis Italy: “We are confident we can offer professionals a unique opportunity. Participating in the Olympic and Paralympic Games is an unparalleled experience.”

The Lombardy regional government has allocated 50 million euros for the Olympic health services plan, of which €41 million are earmarked for building infrastructure, equipment, and strengthening specialist departments, and €9 million for recruitment and training of health personnel.

Mario Melazzini, Lombardy's director general of welfare, confirmed that the €50 million are additional resources and not diverted from ordinary health care, ensuring continuity of care for the regional population.

Regional hospitals will serve as “partner hospitals” coordinated by ASST Niguarda, with the aim of ensuring a complete and efficient network of health services across the region for the duration of the Games.

As for personnel, recruitment will take place through agreements with local health authorities, rescue associations, and other public and private entities, with shifts organized in 5- to 7-day periods. For staff serving in Bormio and Livigno, daily shuttles to and from Milan will be available, while lodging for nonresidents in mountain areas and meals during shifts will be provided.

Giuseppe Massazza, chief medical officer for Milano Cortina 2026, told Univadis Italy: “Our goal is for the Milano Cortina 2026 Games to leave a tangible and concrete legacy, including, of course, a health legacy. The strength of our medical service lies not only in organizing the event but in close collaboration with local health systems.”

The implementation of medical services for these Olympics offers an opportunity to innovate and strengthen regional healthcare infrastructure. The organizational model developed, the technologies introduced, and the skills acquired by health personnel can also be applied after the Games, in routine management or in emergency contexts.

Many temporary polyclinics set up for the Games will be converted into community health centers, expanding access to local care. The collaboration between civil protection services and emergency medical teams tested during the Olympics is expected to serve as a model for future major events.

Among patients with HIV, switching to a long-acting cabotegravir/rilpivirine regimen appeared to be a safe therapeutic option in those with prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) exposure, including patients with isolated HB core antibody (anti-HBc), with no HBV reactivation or incident infection observed. 

“This study provides reassuring evidence that LA-CAB/RPV [long-acting cabotegravir/rilpivirine] is a safe treatment option for PWH [people with HIV] with previous HBV exposure, whether anti-HBs positive or isolated anti-HBc. NRTI [nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor]-sparing regimens should be avoided in individuals with chronic HBV infection,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Alberto Foncillas, Hospital Clinic Barcelona-Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain. It was published online on January 14, 2026, in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

HBV testing was performed only when clinically indicated; therefore, subclinical reactivations may have been missed. The observational design limited causal inference, and residual confounding could not be excluded. Vaccination records were incomplete, follow-up anti-HBs titers were often unavailable, and whole-genome sequencing was not performed.

No study-specific funding was reported. Several authors disclosed receiving honoraria for lectures, research grants, or travel support; participating on advisory boards; or having other relationships with pharmaceutical companies.

The menstrual cycle has clinically relevant implications for injury severity and recovery in elite female footballers, according to prospective data from Spain's top women's league.

Speaking with Univadis Spain, part of the Medscape Professional Network, Eva Ferrer, MD, sports medicine specialist at FC Barcelona Medical Department (FIFA Medical Centre of Excellence) and Barça Innovation Hub in Barcelona, Spain, and lead author of the study published in Frontiers in Sports and Active Living, said, “The menstrual cycle is a physiological part of women's lives and is obviously linked to health.” Ferrer examined the influence of the menstrual cycle on injury risk in elite female athletes.

The research was conducted on professional footballers from Spain's Liga F. Results showed that injury incidence is similar during menstrual bleeding compared with non-bleeding days in elite female football players. However, injuries occurring during menstruation are associated with a significantly higher burden, suggesting an increased risk for more severe injuries during this phase.

To reach these conclusions, researchers prospectively collected data on menstrual cycles and injuries from 33 elite women footballers across four different seasons. The menstrual cycle was tracked using a calendar-based digital tool, and injuries were classified using the Orchard Sports Injury Classification System version 10.

According to Ferrer, the study focused primarily on soft tissue injuries. “We were looking for musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries, but we recorded all injuries occurring throughout the season, not only those linked to routine assessment points. Therefore, there was no bias,” she said.

Menstrual cycle data were self-reported via a club-managed app on the onset and cessation of menstrual bleeding. Only bleeding days were used for the phase classification. Non-bleeding phases were treated as a composite phase due to the absence of hormonal data. “It is not always possible to collect samples and use biomarkers, but we do know that hormone levels, such as estrogen, are low at a specific point in the cycle. That is why we designed the study this way,” Ferrer said. She has previously published related studies in the same journal that included biological samples from the players, using saliva or blood.

“Any research we conduct at the Barça Innovation Hub related to injuries or the menstrual cycle prioritizes health,” Ferrer said. “Knowing whether there is bleeding or not helps us identify whether women may have alterations that lead to abnormal cycles, which typically last between 28 and 35 days, with bleeding usually lasting between 2 and 5 days.”

In the new study, researchers calculated injury incidence rates per 1000 hours of exposure and compared them between bleeding and non-bleeding phases. Among 852 menstrual cycles analyzed, 80 injuries were recorded. Of these injuries, 18 (22.5%) occurred during matches and 62 (77.5%) occurred during training.

The most common injury types were muscle injuries, accounting for 57.5%, followed by ligament injuries at 30% and tendon injuries at 12.5%. Injuries occurring during the bleeding phase represented 13.7% of all cases but resulted in some players spending three times as many days away from the pitch.

“As a healthcare professional, when a situation, pathology, or injury occurs in a player, the first step is to understand the reason and then look for a solution, starting from the most basic to the most advanced and costly,” Ferrer said. She emphasized that athlete health management should be individualized, including adjustments to training load.

According to Ferrer, individualized medical care is essential not only for footballers but also for women more broadly. “Each woman has her own characteristics and needs. It is crucial to understand the starting point. A football player does not have the same needs as a swimmer, and an 18-year-old does not have the same needs as a 40-year-old, among other examples. That is why individualization is essential,” she said.

She also advocates for more research in this area. “Although there is increasing scientific literature on women's sport in general, and football in particular, there are still relatively few publications with strong levels of evidence. We are still quite far behind,” Ferrer concluded.

The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) who presented with antimyeloperoxidase (anti-MPO) ANCA appeared to have a higher risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and a shorter time to their occurrence than those who presented with antiproteinase 3 (anti-PR3) ANCA.

""[The study] findings further support the existence of distinct phenotypic and prognostic differences in AAV based on ANCA specificity and the need for developing a more patient-tailored management,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Jon Idoate Lacasia, Internal Medicine, Hôpital Tenon, Paris, France. It was published online on January 22, 2026, in RMD Open.

The study's retrospective design limited data collection. The cause of death could not be determined for nearly half of deaths recorded during follow-up. The lack of homogeneity in patient-level data prevented the inclusion of important variables such as proteinuria and cumulative glucocorticoid dose.

The study did not receive any specific funding. The authors did not declare having any competing interests.

Medical work across Europe should be formally recognized as an “arduous occupation” to address a staffing crisis that threatens both physician wellbeing and patient safety, medical organizations and patient safety experts said at a conference held at the European Parliament last week.

The conference discussed a proposal by the European Federation of Salaried Doctors (FEMS), which argues that formal recognition would serve as “a strategic lever to improve recruitment and retention of doctors across Europe,” according to FEMS president, Alessandra Spedicato, MD. She emphasized the move would significantly improve the attractiveness of medical careers, particularly in demanding specializations, helping to reduce migration, early exit, and burnout.

The issue has “never been explicitly addressed before,” Spedicato told Medscape News Europe, even though strategies to support and expand the medical workforce are widely discussed within the EU.

The conference brought together medical organizations, trade unions, patient safety experts, and EU-level occupational health bodies to examine the evidence backing the FEMS proposal.

Healthcare workers consistently report the poorest job quality in the EU, Adam Rogalewski, LLM, PhD, policy officer for health and social services at the European Public Services Union, told the conference. Recent survey data showed 30% work beyond their contracted hours, with pressures aggravated by workforce shortages exceeding one million workers across Europe.

Certain specialties carry particularly high risks, according to Marc Hermans, MD, from the European Union of Medical Specialists. Emergency medicine, intensive care, oncology, psychiatry, and surgery face elevated rates of burnout, chronic fatigue, mental health deterioration, and family disruption.

Patient safety “is inseparable from working conditions, workload, staffing levels, and the ability of healthcare professionals to sustain safe performance over time,” said Mirka Cikkelova, MEc, general secretary of the European Patient Safety Foundation (EUPSF). She warned that exhausted doctors pose direct risks to care quality.

From the patient perspective, harm remains frequent, costly, and largely preventable, she said. From the workforce perspective, fatigue, burnout, and emotional exhaustion run high. These “are two expressions of the same system under strain.”

Fatigue signals that “systems are operating too close to their limits,” Cikkelova said. While it affects vigilance and decision-making, it does not automatically lead to errors “only because healthcare professionals continuously compensate,” sometimes at the cost of their mental and physical wellbeing.

She described a vicious cycle: Chronic fatigue undermines staff wellbeing, retention, continuity of care, and technology adoption, increasing vulnerability to adverse events and prompting workers to leave. This hampers recruitment, leading to higher workloads for remaining staff and more pressure. Strong correlations exist between staffing levels and patient safety indicators, she noted.

In most other high-risk industries such as aviation, nuclear energy, and railways, “fatigue has long been recognized as a major systemic risk. This is still not the case in healthcare,” Cikkelova told Medscape News Europe.

Fatigue-related harm for both patients and healthcare professionals remains largely invisible because “it is dispersed across individual patients, departments, hospitals, and even countries and is frequently followed by a search for individual responsibility rather than a discussion about system safety.” Unlike a plane crash, the consequences are rarely seen all at once, even though cumulative harm can be considerable.

“Without formal recognition of fatigue as an occupational risk in healthcare, it is very difficult to move towards meaningful prevention, whether through regulation, organizational obligations, or concrete safety measures,” she said. “As in all high-risk sectors, fatigue cannot be eliminated entirely, but it can and should be actively managed.”

Bogdan Deleanu, MA, from the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work highlighted physical risks including musculoskeletal disorders from manual patient handling, awkward postures, and high workloads. Psychosocial risks such as stress and burnout are strongly interlinked with physical injuries, he said, all contributing to reduced performance, absenteeism, and quitting.

While psychological support after traumatic events is widely recognized as essential in many professions, young doctors and other healthcare professionals are “often left to cope alone with extremely distressing situations,” Cikkelova said.

“Occupational health is for everybody except the doctors,” she said. But they need psychological support and burnout prevention just like other professionals.

The EUPSF supports structured “second-victim” support for the emotional and psychological impacts of adverse events on healthcare professionals. These are widely recognized in the scientific community but remain “insufficiently addressed in everyday healthcare practice.” EUPSF has become the umbrella organization for the RESCUE project, which promotes certification and standards for supporting healthcare professionals after adverse events, and has initiated a Fighting Fatigue Together campaign.

Supporting healthcare professionals “does not in any way diminish the central role of patients and their families as the first victims of adverse events,” Cikkelova stressed. “On the contrary, ensuring appropriate support for professionals is an essential condition for safer care and better outcomes for patients.”

Doctors routinely face intense workloads, high cognitive load, emotional pressure, long shifts, sleep disruption, and continual exposure to stress from clinical complexity and organizational challenges. The work combines high medical responsibility, professional liability, and cumulative exposure to physical and psychosocial risks with long-term impacts on physical and mental health.

The conference examined these issues from multiple perspectives — patients, hospital management, social partners, medical trade unions, and doctors — providing valuable input to improve recommendations presented in a 2025 FEMS policy paper, Spedicato said.

The conference's concluding message was unequivocal, she told Medscape News Europe: without structural changes — legal, organizational, and preventive — the sustainability of health systems, patient safety, and the attractiveness of the medical profession will continue to deteriorate. “Recognizing medical work as an arduous occupation is not only a matter of fairness for healthcare professionals but also a strategic necessity for Europe.”","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Rituximab treatment vs cyclophosphamide treatment in adult patients with immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV) was associated with lower risks for renal complications, such as end-stage renal disease and dialysis dependence.

“In the context of scarce high-quality evidence, these findings offer novel real-world evidence to inform therapeutic decision-making in adult patients with IgAV and renal involvement,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Arjun Mahajan, MS, Harvard Medical School, Boston. It was reported online on January 12, 2026, in a letter to the editor published in Arthritis & Rheumatology.

Risk stratification between skin-limited and renal-involved disease was not possible. Data on medication dosing and exposure were lacking. Combination therapy could not be evaluated due to limited sample size.

One author reported receiving support from the Rheumatology Research Foundation Future Physician Scientist Award. Another author reported receiving support from grants by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and other sources, as well as receiving research support from and performing consultancy for various pharmaceutical and therapeutic companies including Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, and AbbVie unrelated to this work.

Pink noise-often used to promote sleep-may reduce restorative REM sleep and interfere with sleep recovery. In contrast, earplugs were found to be significantly more effective in protecting sleep against traffic noise, according to new study published in the journal Sleep from the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. 

The findings challenge the widespread use of ambient sound machines and apps marketed as sleep aids. 

REM sleep is important for memory consolidation, emotional regulation and brain development, so our findings suggest that playing pink noise and other types of broadband noise during sleep could be harmful-especially for children whose brains are still developing and who spend much more time in REM sleep than adults.""

Mathias Basner, MD, PhD, study lead author, professor of Sleep and Chronobiology in Psychiatry

Researchers observed 25 healthy adults, ages 21 to 41, in a sleep laboratory during eight-hour sleep opportunities over seven consecutive nights. The participants reported not previously using noise to help them sleep or having any sleep disorders. Participants slept under different conditions, including being exposed to aircraft noise, pink noise, aircraft noise with pink noise and aircraft noise with earplugs. Each morning, they completed tests and surveys to measure sleep quality, alertness, and other health effects. 

When we sleep, we cycle multiple times through periods of deep sleep and REM sleep. Deep sleep is important for physical restoration, for memory consolidation, and for clearing toxins from the brain. REM sleep, also called dream sleep, is important for emotional regulation, for motor skills, and for brain development. 

This way, deep and REM sleep complement each other, and collectively guarantee that we wake up restored in the morning, ready for the next day. 

Pink noise is a type of broadband noise-a continuous sound spread across a wide range of frequencies-that sounds uniform and static-like. Broadband noise also includes the well-known white noise and other noise colors like brown and blue noise. 

The different noise colors differ in their energy content across the audible spectrum which determines whether they sound high-pitched or low-pitched. Nature sounds like ocean or rainfall sounds are also broadband sounds, and many household appliances like air conditioning units and fans produce broadband sounds. 

Exposure to aircraft noise-compared to none-was associated with about 23 fewer minutes per night spent in ""N3,"" the deepest sleep stage. Earplugs prevented this drop in deep sleep to a large extent. Pink noise alone at 50 decibels (often compared to the sound of a ""moderate rainfall"") was associated with a nearly 19-minute decrease in REM sleep. 

If pink noise was combined with aircraft noise, both deep sleep and REM sleep were significantly shorter compared to noise-free control nights, and time spent awake was now also 15 minutes longer, which had not been observed in aircraft noise only or pink noise only nights. 

Participants also reported that their sleep felt lighter, they woke up more frequently, and their overall sleep quality was worse when exposed to aircraft noise or pink noise, compared to nights without noise-unless they used earplugs. 

The results, the researchers said, suggest not only that earplugs-which are used by as many as 16 percent of Americans to sleep-are likely effective, but also that the overall health effects of pink noise and other types of broadband noise ""sleep aids"" need to be studied more thoroughly. 

Millions of people play back broadband noise during sleep every night. For example, white noise and ambient podcasts accounted for three million daily hours on the Spotify platform, and the top five videos on YouTube to the prompt ""white noise"" have been watched more than 700 million times. Even so, research on the effects of broadband noise on sleep remains scarce and inconclusive, according to a recent review by Basner and colleagues. 

REM sleep disruption is a common feature of disorders such as depression, anxiety, and Parkinson's disease. Basner noted that young children, compared to adults, spend much more time in REM sleep-and thus may be particularly vulnerable to the ill effects of pink noise. Yet, it is common that parents place sound machines next to the bed of their newborns or toddlers, with the good intention to help them fall and stay asleep. 

""Overall, our results caution against the use of broadband noise, especially for newborns and toddlers, and indicate that we need more research in vulnerable populations, on long-term use, on the different colors of broadband noise, and on safe broadband noise levels in relation to sleep,"" Basner said. 

This research was funded by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration Office of Environment and Energy through ASCENT, the FAA Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels and the Environment, project 86 through FAA Award Number 13-C-AJFE-UPENN under the supervision of Susumu Shirayama.

The final weekend of January saw some of the best performances of the season from U.S. men's national team players, with some looking to find form ahead of the 2026 World Cup while others took major career steps. 

Although the USMNT's most important player, Christian Pulisic has yet to rekindle his early season form with AC Milan, others have shown immense progress as the American player pool develops through the 2025–26 campaign.

The latest week saw plenty of Americans stand out in the final week of the Champions League league phase, as well as in their domestic leagues, while MLS players continued to approach their upcoming campaigns with ongoing preseason camps across Europe, South America and the U.S. 

Here, Sports Illustrated ranks the top four performances of the week from American players across the globe.

Gianluca Busio isn't in the running to make the 2026 World Cup squad, but at 23 years old, he has the potential to be a player of the future of the USMNT. This weekend saw him score his fifth goal of the season in Venezia's 2–1 win over Carrarese in Serie B action as he continues a strong campaign. 

With 17 USMNT caps to his name, the step down to Serie B after relegation last year has allowed him to develop as an attacker, potentially setting him up for further success in the seasons to come. 

Boasting five goals and an assist in 21 matches so far in 2025–26, Busio has played a key role in Venezia's success as they sit atop the division with 47 points through 22 matches, eyeing promotion in the coming months. 

A former Sporting Kansas City starlet, Busio is in the final five months of his contract with the Italian side.

The presumed starting striker for the USMNT this summer, Folarin Balogun had a heavy week with a scoreless draw against Weston McKennie's Juventus in the Champions League, followed by a 4–0 win over Rennes in Ligue 1 action. 

While he struggled to make a significant impact in the Champions League, he helped set up two goals against Rennes, picking up an assist on Ansu Fati's opening strike in the 33rd minute. 

Although he wasn't extremely present in front of the goal, his ability to drop deeper and set up each of Fati and fellow winger, Aleksandr Golovin showed his adaptability as a playmaker in a central attacking role. 

Despite a productive match, Balogun had to leave in the 56th minute with hamstring tightness, a worrying sign for the next few weeks leading into the March friendlies with the USMNT. 

Malik Tillman's return to the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen has had its ups and downs this season, but he had an outstanding week, scoring three goals across two matches.

To start, the American bagged a brace against Villarreal in the Champions League to help his side move on in the competition with a 16th-place finish in the league phase, before playing a key role and finding the back of the net in his side's 3–1 win over Frankfurt on Saturday. 

Both matches saw him play as a right-sided attacking midfielder, where he made late runs into the box and quick linkups with a mix of attacking partners, including Ibrahim Maza and Patrik Schick against Villarreal, and Martin Terrier and Christian Kofane against Frankfurt. 

While he likely won't maintain scoring more than a goal per game, the uptick in attacking form will be welcome news for Pochettino, with the USMNT looking to bolster further attacking midfield options alongside Christian Pulisic, who has started to slow down with Milan. 

Weston McKennie was at it again for @juventusfc on Sunday! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/rMtrVGXj19

Weston McKennie still doesn't have a contract beyond 2026 with Juventus, but given how he has played, that seems bound to change. This week, the 27-year-old star continued to showcase his stellar form with his third goal of the Serie A season in a 4–1 win over Parma, following up a strong showing in a scoreless draw against Monaco to advance in the Champions League. 

The goal against Parma marked his fourth in all competitions since the calendar flipped to 2026 and helped the Bianconeri to fourth in the Serie A table, extending a consistent rise under manager Luciano Spalletti. 

McKennie started centrally in the win over Parma, playing as a near false-nine compared to the wider roles he has played for the majority of this season. The adjustment came less than a week after Spalletti called him a potential “perfect striker,” following a win over Napoli. 

The performance saw him continue to make the most of a flourishing partnership with fellow North American Jonathan David, while mustering two chances created and three shots. David, meanwhile, found his fourth goal and third assist in the last seven matches. 

McKennie's versatility and continued standout play can only be good news for everyone involved. For Juventus, their hopes of Champions League play in 2026–27 continued, while McKennie made his case for a new contract. As for the USMNT, he'll hope to bring that form into March and to the World Cup.

England's World Cup team will stay at the Inn at Meadowbrook, according to a report published Sunday in a British tabloid.

The Daily Mail reported and local sources have confirmed that the national soccer team has booked the entire 54-room hotel in Prairie Village for the duration of the tournament.

England is one of four possible teams that may use Kansas City as a base camp, but the first one to be publicly linked to a particular hotel.

Kansas City is a host city and a hub for the international tournament, which runs from June 11 to July 19.

World Cup teams generally bring in sizable delegations in addition to the playing and coaching staff. A broad estimate is 60 to 80 people, including public relations staff, equipment managers, medics and security, although exact numbers for this year have not been disclosed.

The boutique hotel at Meadowbrook Park, which opened in 2020 on the site of the former Meadowbrook Country Club, has 54 rooms. It is unknown whether non-playing or non-coaching staff will be put up elsewhere.

Teams often do not stay once they have been knocked out of the tournament, so there's a possibility England would not be in Prairie Village for the entire time. England won the tournament in 1966, but has not placed since.

The hotel describes itself online as one of “comfort and luxury” with a nod to the English cottage aesthetic.

England will play its group stages (the earliest rounds of the tournament) in other cities, but chose Kansas City as its home base because of its central location and after consulting players, the Mail reported.

In the past, the team has had personal touches installed at its World Cup hotels, including pictures of family and loved ones and comforting scents in public areas, according to the Mail.

Meadowbrook management did not immediately respond to the Post's request for comment on whether the team has asked for anything yet.

Management at the restaurant Verbena attached to the Inn also declined to comment on Monday.

At the last World Cup, in Qatar, England stayed at the Souq Al Wakra, a posh five-star hotel with a private beach.

Other teams that have been mentioned as likely to use the Kansas City area as a base camp are Argentina, the Netherlands and Algeria. So far, they have not indicated where they might stay.

Argentina won the tournament the last time around in 2022.

KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) Embassy in Jamaica is inviting applications from locals wishing to attend the upcoming 2026 World Cup.

In a post on X, the embassy said the US is prepared to welcome visitors from around the world to the greatest FIFA World Cup 2026 in history.

“Be a part of history and apply for your US visa today! All visa applicants need to meet all eligibility requirements under US law,” the embassy said.

The World Cup will be held in a cross-continent showing, in Mexico, Canada and the United States. Record ticket requests have already been generated for the event

Some social media users have expressed uncertainty online about attending US matches, citing an ongoing immigration crackdown in the country, while multiple football executives including former FIFA president Sepp Blatter have supported a proposed fan boycott.

Tensions have been heightened by US President Donald Trump's repeated comments about anexxing Greenland.

Trump on the other hand has expressed confidence that this World Cup will be the best in history.

GOAL spoke with the American in January to reflect on a whirlwind 2025 as he prepares for an even bigger 2026

The story of Alex Freeman's rise can be boiled down to two friendlies. Yes, what came in between was complicated and the product of years of work, but Freeman's leap from Orlando anonymity to Villarreal can be traced back to what changed between two U.S. Men's National Team games.

The first came back in May. Freeman's USMNT debut against Turkey was a dream come true. It was also the scariest day of his life. The hours leading up to his duels with Arda Guler and Kenan Yildiz were some of the most nerve-wracking imaginable. It wasn't until midway through the game that Freeman thought there was an off chance he might belong.

Fast forward to November and the USMNT's clash with Uruguay, the team that had knocked many of Freeman's now-teammates out of the Copa America just a year-and-a-half prior. That was his 13th cap and his most consequential to date. On that day, there was no fear, no nerves, no second-guessing. Freeman, a defender, went out and scored two goals in a 5-1 win over one of the best teams in the world. The only disappointment? He wanted more.

""At first, it was sort of relief, like 'Damn, I got my first goal',"" he told GOAL at MLS Media Day in early January, ""but as the game went on, it was like 'Am I going for the hat-trick now?' It gives you the confidence to build off of those moments. The hat-trick was in my head, though. I was like, 'Bro, give me one more chance for one more goal'. It was such a cool moment for me.""

From pregame anxiety to hunting hat-tricks against a South American powerhouse, that's how Freeman's life changed over the course of just a few months in 2025. It changed again to start 2026. On January 29, Freeman completed a move to La Liga heavyweight Villarreal for a fee that could reportedly rise to $7 million. The fee would have been higher, but Freeman was in the final year of his contract. Last January, Freeman was just hoping to make a few starts for Orlando City's first team. Now, he has the same goal for a team that played in the Champions League this season after making a multi-million dollar move that seemed unfathomable just a few short months ago.

That's how big a change 2025 was for Freeman. All of the work paid off with not only accolades, but a major move abroad. Life is very different now, as are expectations. After thinking on it a bit more, though, Freeman can acknowledge that he's different, too.

""It's kind of hard to comprehend that,"" Freeman told GOAL. ""You know that things can change so quickly. A year ago, it was, 'Oh, I have to prove myself. Now, it's 'I've gotta take my level up another notch'. It's knowing I have to fight for my position, for a World Cup position. That switch, it's different. It's not the same, but I think it gives you more reason to push yourself. It's knowing that you have different expectations than you did before. 

""I think it's good for me because not only did it help me grow up a little more, it helped me realize that life can change so quickly, so be grateful for every moment.""

This is a look at the year that changed Freeman's life, and the moments to come that he hopes will change it a bit more.

The first time Orlando City coach Oscar Pareja saw Freeman play, he knew. There was something there, he thought to himself, and it wouldn't be too hard to let that something out. All Freeman would need was an opportunity. Pareja and Orlando just needed to find the right time to give it to him.

""We knew about his background,"" Pareja told GOAL last summer. ""We knew that, just naturally, he would be a strong player, for sure. But could we convert all of those muscles and those physical qualities that he had into a really good footballer? He had so many things that came very natural with him, including his combinations and interpretation of the game. I've seen plenty of tall, physical, strong players. Not all cases were like him.""

""He has this instinct to connect that is so natural,"" he continued, ""but the curious thing or the rare thing that I see is just how easily and often he can connect with players offensively. That's just something that I have not seen much around the world. It's an instinct, I have no doubt. It's not coaching. It's just something that he has within him: a sensitivity for the attacking side of the game.""

American soccer fans got several glimpses at that throughout the year. Those watching Orlando saw it time and time again as Freeman went from youth-team product to arguably the best fullback in MLS seemingly overnight. USMNT fans saw it throughout the second half of 2025 as Freeman blossomed from that nervous debutant into a player who believes he can fight for a World Cup spot. That growth was defined by Freeman's ability to earn and seize opportunities. He took every one thrown at him in his life-changing year.

""It's what I tell a lot of people,"" Freeman says. ""People ask me about life in the soccer world, and I say the main thing is to take your opportunities. You never know when you'll have one again. Me moving to Orlando was an opportunity that could have gone south. It went the right way for me, so now this year is my chance to take another opportunity. My first start, my first minutes last year, it was all about being able to take it all in and trying to be the best that I could be, knowing that the opportunities may never come again. That's what you have to do. 

""That's with your club, with your national team, and that's something with life in general. You have to take your opportunities, or else someone else is going to come up, someone younger, faster, and maybe even not as good as you, but they'll take that opportunity to improve themselves more than you did, and your opportunity is gone. It really is that simple.""

All of that earned him a new opportunity: one that's thousands of miles away from home in one of the best leagues in the world.

As of early January, Freeman was still saying he expected to be in Orlando. He had a lot coming up with the Lions, he said, and he hoped the MLS season could be the springboard he needed to get into the USMNT. He wasn't looking at the rumors, he told GOAL. Those were for other people to figure out.

Ultimately, though, it all did come together. By the last week of January, Freeman was off to Villarreal. The move had been rumored for months. Now, it was suddenly real, with Freeman donning the club's kit, speaking Spanish on social media and preparing for his latest challenge.

Yet, the accelerated nature of the transfer presented challenges for all sides. For Orlando, it was no doubt tough to lose the defender, but selling him now was the lesser of two evils as the fullback's contract entered its final year. For Freeman, it was no doubt difficult to leave Orlando, given the home he built there. And for Villarreal, it was a big swing on a player with limitless potential but, admittedly, little experience on the highest of levels.

In the end, everyone decided it was the right time. 

“Alex's journey is a testament to the strength of our academy, OCB, and the pathway we've built,” said Orlando City General Manager and Sporting Director Ricardo Moreira said. “He showed maturity and commitment at every level, rising from a young prospect to an MLS All-Star and one of the league's top emerging talents. Watching his development up close has been incredibly rewarding for all of us at the Club. We're proud of everything Alex has accomplished here and wish him continued success as he takes this next step in his professional career.” 

Among those Freeman talked to throughout the process was Mauricio Pochettino. The USMNT head coach has a big decision coming in just a few months as he prepares his World Cup squad, and Freeman wants to make sure he's on the right side of that decision. Because of that, the 21-year-old defender spoke with Pochettino before making the move, with the Argentine giving the transfer his blessing.

""He called me and asked about the situation, what was my point of view about the change that could possibly happen,"" he said. ""I said, 'You need to be very natural and take what you believe is the best option for you, for your family, and, of course, for the people that advise you.' As a coach and all the coaching staff, we need to support our players always because there are too many things that can happen. It's always about being supportive and giving them confidence that the decisions they are going to make are the best decisions.

""That is why I am not worried, not concerned, about whether some players are going to move in the transfer window, because I always expect the best thing. For me, it's important that the player feels happy, feels comfortable, but we don't want it to be in a comfortable zone. This type of thing can happen because they want to improve and they want to grow. I think it's an amazing challenge that we need to support and help to adapt in the best possible way and not to lose focus on the performance, if they happen to move to different clubs. There, too, is a focus on the World Cup and to have that opportunity to fight for a place.""

That fight remains ongoing, even as it changes countries in Freeman's particular case.

Freeman is the posterboy for what happens when things go right. He seized every chance he was given in 2025, swiftly climbing the ladder from unknown to a player worthy of a La Liga transfer. No one is more aware of how right things went than the man himself. No one is also more aware of how quickly things can go wrong.

There's no time to count blessings or rest on past successes. Things can change quickly. One dip in form could be the end of a World Cup dream. If Freeman doesn't find a way to contribute at Villarreal, he can get leapfrogged by someone somewhere else who is contributing. That's the type of competition Pochettino has fostered, and that isn't slowing down with the World Cup just a few months away.

Freeman also knows that things can change because of things beyond his control. His Orlando City breakout only happened because an injury opened the door for one start and then another and then another. Things can change at any time. All a player can do is be ready for it.

""The player pool is so big, you never know what's going to happen in the next few months,"" he says. ""People can get injured. You've seen it with someone like Tyler Adams, and hopefully, he's healthy for the World Cup, but stuff like that can happen. An injury can ruin anyone's chance. It's just knowing that the World Cup spots are open for anyone, so it's just knowing that you have to go in and be able to enjoy yourself and be consistent. You have to be ready.""

That was the goal of his MLS offseason: to be ready. In some ways, it was about staying ready and keeping the base that had been built up throughout 2025. In others, though, it was about taking a step back, reflecting, and appreciating all that had changed.

""I had the offseason to really enjoy all of the moments I had,"" Freeman said. ""I think it was important for me to take everything in, everything that I couldn't before, because I had to keep going. It was good to be able to appreciate that with my family and my friends.

""2025 was a long year, a lot of games, so it is about knowing that you need to reset and spend time with family and look back with them and go, 'Wow, I did that'."" 

In the end, Freeman finished 2025 with 13 USMNT caps. He was an MLS All-Star, the league's Young Player of the Year and a Best XI selection. Now, he's part of an ever-changing group of Americans carrying the torch in Europe, not just for themselves but for those who come after.

That is one of the bigger changes for Freeman. A year ago, he was anonymous. Few outside of Orlando had ever even heard of him, let alone seen him play. He told GOAL during the summer that he'd spent his whole life being the son of former NFL star Antonio Freeman. One of his goals, then, was to have a name worthy of his kids being called the children of Alex. 

Last year was a step, then. He's known now throughout American soccer. Soon, he hopes, he'll be known in Spain, too, competing for a club that is right behind the big three at the top of La Liga's table. Is 2025 the big leap or just one of many? That's the question on everyone's mind as Freeman prepares for his next big challenges.

""What's gone on over the last year, it's almost like nothing has gone off track much,"" he says. ""Everything over the last year for me, it kind of flowed. Everything flowed the way it was supposed to, and that's why I'm so grateful. Somehow, the pieces all fit together.

""It just felt like one of those movies where everything happens, and everyone ends up together because everything just clicks. Obviously, there are bumps in the road, but for me, knowing that I overcame a lot of things and that everything still clicked anyway? That's what really matters.""

Nervy days against Turkey, Gold Cup breakthroughs, a brawl with Paraguay, a hat-trick hope against Uruguay, and everything in between, those were the moments that clicked for Freeman throughout a 2025 that will be hard to top. This year is just getting going, though, and, with a World Cup on the way, Freeman is eyeing the next opportunity to come his way.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

F1 Barcelona Shakedown 2026: Day 5 Highlights

Newey 'always teaching us something', says Fernando Alonso

Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has reflected on the team's encouraging display at the Barcelona Shakedown.

Toto Wolff has described himself as “really happy” over Mercedes' smooth start to 2026 and F1's all-new era of regulations at the Barcelona Shakedown, but admits the squad “simply don't know” where they stand at this point.

Mercedes were one of the consistent runners during last week's initial pre-season gathering – George Russell and Kimi Antonelli steadily racking up the laps aboard the W17, and sounding cautious optimism over their programme.

On Monday, Mercedes regrouped for their official team launch, with Wolff taking a moment to review the Shakedown from the Silver Arrows' perspective, as well as pondering what the competition have been up to.

“I'm really happy how it went for us, in the sense of the interaction of the power unit, deployment and the chassis,” team boss Wolff commented to a select group of media, including F1.com.

“Having said that, we had a solid three days, that is something to build upon, but we don't have really a performance picture yet. We haven't seen Max [Verstappen] driving the [Red Bull] car fast, we haven't seen McLaren and Ferrari doing what they can do. So, I would carefully refrain from saying it was great for us – we simply don't know.”

With Mercedes most recently winning a title in 2021, when they clinched the last of eight successive Teams' Championship crowns, Wolff was asked if anything but a championship challenge in 2026 could be classed as a failure.

“Failure is such a harsh word in a way,” he replied. “We're into these regulations for the next few years. How I'd like to see this is the way we're thinking about it is not always the optimisation on a weekend or a season, but seeing an upward trajectory.

“Whatever the case is that we're coming out of the blocks… I'm certain there will be challenges, our own challenges, the relative performance against the others. Let's see how it goes, let's see if we have a car that has the potential to fight for a championship.”

He added: “As you know, I'm always sceptical about performance. I've too often set my expectations in the wrong place, and I just don't want to come to a realisation in Bahrain or in Melbourne that we are not what we thought we were going to be, and that is a race winner.”

While the performance of the W17 relative to its rivals remains unknown, Wolff has no doubt over the potential of his two drivers, Russell and Antonelli, who continue as team mates for a second season.

Addressing Russell being the pre-season betting ‘favourite', Wolff said: “It's always nice if your driver is the favourite for the bookmakers, and I think he deserves it, because he's one of the best. He's shown us where the performance of the car is, and he's been overall more than great to us.

“But also there, it's always the best driver and best car that wins, and we haven't yet proven that we have a package that is good enough. We haven't been in the hot in Bahrain with the abrasive tarmac, which was always tricky for us. I hope the bookmakers are right, but I'll believe it when we've seen performances that would confirm that.

“As for Kimi, he's completely on the trajectory that we've always mapped out at the beginning. Last year, his first year in F1, with this huge circus coming upon him, the obligations with the media, the requests from sponsors, and fandom, and that's exactly why we had very good performances and then some races where he struggled more.

“There's no doubt about his speed and about his race craft. He's going into his second season, he knows all the tracks, he knows all of you guys [the media], he knows most of the other requirements. I'm absolutely certain that it will be a good year for him.

“Having said that, I don't think we should expect him to be like George all the time. George is one of the best ones, he's been in F1 a long time, he's a benchmark, and Kimi's 19 and going into his second season. We're going to see another step, that I'm certain about.”

F1 Barcelona Shakedown 2026: Day 5 Highlights

Newey 'always teaching us something', says Fernando Alonso

How will Isack Hadjar stack up against Max Verstappen in comparison to the Red Bull driver's previous team mates?

Having achieved four World Championships, 71 wins, 127 podiums and 48 pole positions since his arrival in Formula 1 more than a decade ago, Max Verstappen has earned his place amongst the most successful drivers in the sport's history – which arguably makes the prospect of becoming his team mate slightly intimidating.

It is a challenge that Isack Hadjar is about to face, with the 21-year-old the next to race alongside Verstappen at Red Bull following the demotion of Yuki Tsunoda to a test and reserve role. Hadjar will be Verstappen's eighth team mate in F1 – but how will he stack up compared to those who held the role before him?

We've been taking a deep-dive through the statistics to see how each of the seven drivers to previously share a garage with Verstappen performed against the Dutchman…

Qualifying head-to-head: Sainz 10-9 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Sainz 7-10 Verstappen
Points scored: Sainz – 18 (36.8% of races finished in points), 15th in championship / Verstappen – 49 (52.6% of races finished in points), 12th in championship
Pole positions: Sainz 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Podiums: Sainz 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Wins: Sainz 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)

An all-rookie line-up joined Toro Rosso in 2015, consisting of Verstappen – who became the youngest driver to make their F1 debut, at 17 years and 164 days old – and Carlos Sainz. The latter made an early impression by scoring points in his first race, while Verstappen was forced to retire with an engine failure.

As the numbers show, the pair were closely matched in the head-to-heads throughout the season. Sainz suffered more mechanically-related retirements – particularly during the middle of the campaign – and Verstappen ultimately ended 2015 with more points.

Qualifying head-to-head: Sainz 1-3 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Sainz 2-2 Verstappen
Points scored: Sainz – 4 (50% of races finished in points), 12th in championship (points total 46 for whole season) / Verstappen – 13 (75% of races finished in points), fifth in championship (points total 204 for whole season)
Pole positions: Sainz 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Podiums: Sainz 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Wins: Sainz 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)

It would turn out to be a much shorter tenure as team mates for Verstappen and Sainz in 2016, with Verstappen promoted to the main Red Bull outfit after just four races. But in those few Grands Prix together prior to the switch, the duo were again relatively well-matched.

Verstappen just beat Sainz in terms of points finishes on three to two, while both drivers suffered a DNF due to a technical issue.

Qualifying head-to-head: Ricciardo 11-6 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Ricciardo 10-7 Verstappen
Points scored: Ricciardo – 220 (100% of races finished in points), third in championship (points total 256 for whole season) / Verstappen – 191 (82.4% of races finished in points), fifth in championship (points total 204 for whole season)
Pole positions: Ricciardo 1 (5.9%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Podiums: Ricciardo 8 (47.1%) / Verstappen 7 (41.2%)
Wins: Ricciardo 1 (5.9%) / Verstappen 1 (5.9%)

A new era unfolded for Verstappen when he made the step up to Red Bull just a few races into his sophomore season, with the Dutchman partnering Daniel Ricciardo while Daniil Kvyat was sent back to the Toro Rosso outfit.

It was a memorable arrival at the squad for Verstappen, the youngster promptly winning on his debut in Barcelona. While the more experienced Ricciardo triumphed in the head-to-heads – the Australian finishing a career-best third in the championship during a particularly strong year – Verstappen ended the campaign equal on wins with his team mate and only scored one less podium.

Qualifying head-to-head: Ricciardo 7-13 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Ricciardo 9-11 Verstappen
Points scored: Ricciardo – 200 (70% of races finished in points), fifth in championship / Verstappen – 168 (65% of races finished in points), sixth in championship
Pole positions: Ricciardo 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Podiums: Ricciardo 9 (45%) / Verstappen 4 (20%)
Wins: Ricciardo 1 (5%) / Verstappen 2 (10%)

Red Bull endured a weaker season in 2017, one in which they often experienced reliability issues. Verstappen suffered more retirements than Ricciardo during the early stages of the campaign but went on to enjoy a stronger run towards the end, scoring two victories in the final six races.

Ricciardo again led the way in terms of points scored, but Verstappen got the better of his team mate in the Qualifying and race day head-to-heads as he continued to hone his skills.

Qualifying head-to-head: Ricciardo 7-14 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Ricciardo 5-14 Verstappen
Points scored: Ricciardo 170 (61.9% of races finished in points), sixth in championship / Verstappen – 249 (81% of races finished in points), fourth in championship
Pole positions: Ricciardo 2 (9.5%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Podiums: Ricciardo 2 (9.5%) / Verstappen 11 (52.4%)
Wins: Ricciardo 2 (9.5%) / Verstappen 2 (9.5%)

The 2018 campaign seemed to mark a turning point in that the momentum appeared to switch in Verstappen's favour. Ricciardo grabbed two wins early in the season – a marked contrast to the difficult start faced by Verstappen – but these would prove to be the Australian's only podium finishes in 2018.

On the other side of the garage, Verstappen collected 11 rostrums and outscored his team mate on most counts, though the Dutchman was still yet to claim a pole position while Ricciardo had also suffered more mechanically-related DNFs. Both drivers failed to finish in Bahrain and Azerbaijan, the latter being due to an infamous collision between the Red Bull cars. Ricciardo later surprised the F1 world by leaving for Renault at the end of the season.

Qualifying head-to-head: Gasly 1-11 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Gasly 1-11 Verstappen
Points scored: Gasly – 63 (75% of races finished in points), seventh in championship (points total 95 for whole season) / Verstappen – 181 (100% of races finished in points), third in championship (points total 278 for whole season)
Pole positions: Gasly 0 (0%) / Verstappen 1 (8.3%)
Podiums: Gasly 0 (0%) / Verstappen 5 (41.7%)
Wins: Gasly 0 (0%) / Verstappen 2 (16.7%)

Following Ricciardo's exit, Red Bull opted to promote Pierre Gasly from Toro Rosso, making the Frenchman Verstappen's third F1 team mate.

While Gasly struggled to match the incumbent driver in the head-to-heads, the numbers suggest that he displayed decent consistency, having scored points in all but three of his races for the squad. This would not be enough to keep his place at the team, however, and Gasly was sent back to Toro Rosso for the remainder of the season after Round 12 in Hungary.

Qualifying head-to-head: Albon 1-8 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Albon 4-5 Verstappen
Points scored: Albon – 76 (88.9% of races finished in points), eighth in championship (points total 92 for whole season) / Verstappen – 97 (77.8% of races finished in points), third in championship (points total 278 for whole season)
Pole positions: Albon 0 (0%) / Verstappen 1 (11.1%)
Podiums: Albon 0 (0%) / Verstappen 4 (44.4%)
Wins: Albon 0 (0%) / Verstappen 1 (11.1%)

Alex Albon became the next to step up to Red Bull, the Thai driver swapping places with Gasly and enjoying a solid run in his nine races alongside Verstappen in 2019.

An impressive record saw Albon collect points in every race – with the only exception being Brazil, where he had looked on course for his debut podium before dropping down the order after contact with Lewis Hamilton – and his performances sealed his place at the Milton Keynes-based outfit for 2020.

Qualifying head-to-head: Albon 0-17 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Albon 5-12 Verstappen
Points scored: Albon – 105 (70.6% of races finished in points), seventh in championship / Verstappen – 214 (70.6% of races finished in points), third in championship
Pole positions: Albon 0 (0%) / Verstappen 1 (5.9%)
Podiums: Albon 2 (11.8%) / Verstappen 11 (64.7%)
Wins: Albon 0 (0%) / Verstappen 2 (11.8%)

In a shortened season owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, Albon faced a tougher outing in 2020, one in which Verstappen was dominant in Qualifying as well as outscoring his team mate on race days.

While Albon came away with his maiden podium at Mugello – as well as scoring a second in Bahrain – Red Bull again decided to make a change to their line-up, resulting in the Thai racer becoming a test and reserve driver for the squad in 2021.

Qualifying head-to-head: Perez 2-20 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Perez 3-19 Verstappen
Points scored: Perez – 190 (72.7% of races finished in points), fourth in championship / Verstappen – 395.5 (86.4% of races finished in points), first in championship
Pole positions: Perez 0 (0%) / Verstappen 10 (45.5%)
Podiums: Perez 5 (22.7%) / Verstappen 18 (81.8%)
Wins: Perez 1 (4.5%) / Verstappen 10 (45.5%)

Red Bull signed the experienced Sergio Perez for 2021, with the team taking the slightly unusual step of looking outside of their driver programme for their new recruit.

Though the Mexican could not prove a match for Verstappen, he fulfilled a solid supporting role in a season remembered for the tense title battle that played out between Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton. During the summer, it was confirmed that Perez would remain a Red Bull driver in 2022.

Qualifying head-to-head: Perez 5-17 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Perez 5-17 Verstappen
Points scored: Perez – 305 (86.4% of races finished in points), third in championship / Verstappen – 454 (90.9% of races finished in points), first in championship
Pole positions: Perez 1 (4.5%) / Verstappen 7 (31.8%)
Podiums: Perez 11 (50%) / Verstappen 17 (77.3%)
Wins: Perez 2 (9.1%) / Verstappen 15 (68.2%)

After a nightmare first race in which both drivers retired with the same mechanical issue, Red Bull quickly bounced back and went on to enjoy an increasingly dominant campaign in 2022.

The Drivers' Championship was claimed by Verstappen with four races to spare, while Perez built further on his 2021 season by doubling his number of podiums and wins, as well as taking a debut pole position.

Qualifying head-to-head: Perez 3-19 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Perez 2-20 Verstappen
Points scored: Perez – 285 (86.4% of races finished in points), second in championship / Verstappen – 575 (100% of races finished in points), first in championship
Pole positions: Perez 2 (8.7%) / Verstappen 12 (52.2%)
Podiums: Perez 9 (39.1%) / Verstappen 21 (91.3%)
Wins: Perez 2 (8.7%) / Verstappen 19 (82.6%)

The statistics from Verstappen's side in 2023 make for astonishing reading, with the Dutch driver scoring a record-breaking 19 wins out of 22 races en route to his most assured title yet.

Such was the level of Verstappen's performance that – despite Perez finishing a career-best second in the championship – the World Champion claimed 290 more points than his team mate.

Qualifying head-to-head: Perez 1-23 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Perez 1-23 Verstappen
Points scored: Perez – 152 (66.7% of races finished in points), eighth in championship / Verstappen – 437 (95.8% of races finished in points), first in championship
Pole positions: Perez 0 (0%) / Verstappen 8 (33.3%)
Podiums: Perez 4 (16.7%) / Verstappen 14 (58.3%)
Wins: Perez 0 (0%) / Verstappen 9 (37.5%)

It initially appeared that Red Bull's 2023 advantage over the rest of the field might repeat in 2024 following a 1-2 result for the squad at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix. However, the picture proved very different as the campaign developed, with the squad's rivals dramatically closing the gap.

Despite the challenges, Verstappen held on to clinch his fourth title – but it was a nightmare campaign for Perez, the Mexican failing to stand on the podium again after Round 5 in China. Red Bull slipped backwards from first to third in the Teams' Championship, and it was announced after the season had concluded that the team and Perez had agreed to part ways with immediate effect.

Qualifying head-to-head: Lawson 0-2 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Lawson 0-2 Verstappen
Points scored: Lawson – 0 (0% of races finished in points), 14th in championship (points total 22 for whole season)/ Verstappen – 36 (100% of races finished in points), second in championship (points total 421 for whole season)
Pole positions: Lawson 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)
Podiums: Lawson 0 (0%) / Verstappen 1 (50%)
Wins: Lawson 0 (0%) / Verstappen 0 (0%)

After the exit of Perez, Red Bull promoted Liam Lawson for the 2025 season – but his tenure as Verstappen's team mate would prove to be the shortest of all, the New Zealander struggling to get comfortable with the RB21 machine.

Having qualified at the back of the field during both of the opening races – and crashing out at the rain-affected Australian Grand Prix – Lawson was demoted back to Racing Bulls in time for the third round of the season.

Qualifying head-to-head: Tsunoda 0-22 Verstappen / Race head-to-head: Tsunoda 1-21 Verstappen
Points scored: Tsunoda – 30 (31.8% of races finished in points), 17th in championship (points total 33 for whole season) / Verstappen – 385 (95.5% of races finished in points), second in championship (points total 421 for whole season)
Pole positions: Tsunoda 0 (0%) / Verstappen 8 (36.4%)
Podiums: Tsunoda 0 (0%) / Verstappen 14 (63.6%)
Wins: Tsunoda 0 (0%) / Verstappen 8 (36.4%)

While Lawson returned to Racing Bulls, a direct swap saw Yuki Tsunoda become the next to pit himself against Verstappen at Red Bull. However, like Lawson, the Japanese driver also faced his fair share of difficulties in adapting to his new car.

Throughout their 22 races together, Verstappen beat Tsunoda in both head-to-heads – with Tsunoda's only better finish being in Austria, a race that Verstappen retired from on Lap 1 – and ended the season a whopping 15 places ahead in the Drivers' Championship.

Prior to the campaign finale in Abu Dhabi, it was announced that Tsunoda would move to a test and reserve role in 2026. Isack Hadjar, meanwhile, will be the latest to pair up with Verstappen as he makes the step up to Red Bull in the season ahead…

The entertainment industry is mourning the loss of beloved actress Catherine O'Hara, who passed away on January 30. O'Hara leaves behind a loving family and an incredible career. Many actors who knew her or worked with her have paid tribute, including a heartfelt statement from her on-screen daughter, Annie Murphy. 

Murphy played Alexis Rose on the popular series, “Schitt's Creek,” which ran for six seasons from 2015 until 2020. O'Hara's was her onscreen mother, Moira Rose. 

Murphy shared several photos of herself and O'Hara on Instagram, and in her caption, she discussed who O'Hara was and how she would be missed. “Ha-ha-HAAAA?!?! Her laugh was a perpetual Yes, And… It challenged anyone who heard it to join in, and be as delighted as she was,” Murphy wrote. “Gosh, were we ever lucky to have her.” 

She ended her message with the hashtag #goodbyetoagreatactress and a wearing sunglasses emoji. “The sunglasses are because I'm in mourning, David!” a fan shared. “Schitt's Creek” was created by Eugene Levy and his son, Dan Levy. David refers to Dan's character on the show, David Rose, who was O'Hara's onscreen son. Eugene played Johnny Rose.

Other rections include, “The greatest mother daughter duo to ever hit the screen,” “The fact that I was watching this show at the moment I found out brought me to tears. She and this show was and still is my happy in these very stressing time. RIP Moira Rose,” and “It's hard to put into words the feeling of this loss. Her work was a meaningful part of so many lives. Thinking of you, her family, and those closest to her.”

O'Hara and Eugene had a friendship that spanned five decades after first meeting in the ‘70s at the Toronto-based improv troupe, Second City. Both Eugene and Dan have penned beautiful tributes for O'Hara as they mourn her loss and celebrate her brilliance. 

“What a gift to have gotten to dance in the warm glow of Catherine O'Hara's brilliance for all those years,” Dan wrote on Instagram. “Having spent over fifty years collaborating with my Dad, Catherine was extended family before she ever played my family. It's hard to imagine a world without her in it. I will cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her. My heart goes out to Bo, Matthew, Luke and every member of her big, beautiful family.”

O'Hara had an incredible career with her most recent work on the series “The Studio” and “The Last of Us,” both of which last aired in May 2025. Her death was announced by her rep, who revealed she died at her Los Angeles Bentwood home “following a brief illness,” TMZ reports. She was 71.

It should come as no surprise that Amazon's documentary “Melania,” about First Lady Melania Trump, grossed $7 million at the box office over the weekend, making it the highest opening for a non-music documentary in over a decade. 

That's not because “Melania” is an exquisitely made, informative documentary. It's not even a documentary. 

Instead, it falls in the category of glossy advertisement or unconvincing propaganda film with a multimillion-dollar music licensing budget. Amazon MGM Studios paid $40 million for the rights to film. That offer came with a jaw-dropping $35 million marketing budget, which Amazon spent while also cutting 16,000 corporate jobs.  The film is the latest streamer-funded, carefully choreographed, boring, celebrity puff piece being branded as a documentary. Previous examples of documentaries in this category include “Michael Jackson's This Is It,” “With Love, Meghan,” and, most recently, “Victoria Beckham,” a Netflix docuseries. (To be fair, all three of those documentaries were far more revealing than “Melania”; the only thing that one learns about Melania Trump during her 104-minute infomercial is that her favorite song is Michael Jackson's “Billie Jean.”)But the merits of Brett Ratner's “Melania” don't matter. The film is and will continue to be a box office hit because anti-woke, conservative, and faith-based documentaries thrive theatrically.

Take Matt Walsh's 2024 “Am I Racist?” — a right-leaning film that tears into diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The film was that year's highest-grossing documentary, earning $12 million at the box office. That same year, a documentary titled “Vindicating Trump” earned $1.3 million theatrically, which for any documentary these days is a lot of money. “Vindicating Trump” was the sixth highest-grossing documentary in 2024. 

Over a decade ago, before the Trump era, conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza's “2016: Obama's America” and “America: Imagine the World Without Her” grossed $33 million and $14 million at the box office, respectively.It's been over 20 years since progressive documentaries were box-office juggernauts. In 2004, Michael Moore's Academy Award-winning film “Fahrenheit 9/11,” a searing look into the George W. Bush administration and the War on Terror, grossed $119,194,771 worldwide, making it the highest-grossing documentary of all time. 

In 2005, Davis Guggenheim's Oscar-winning feature documentary “March of the Penguins,” about global warming, earned $77,437,223 worldwide. That is in stark contrast to the 2025 Oscar-winning feature documentary “No Other Land,” about the occupied Palestinian region of Masafer Yatta, which grossed $3.6 million worldwide. Other recent Oscar-winning documentaries, like “20 Days in Mariupol” and “Navalny,” earned just $35,000 and $107,000 worldwide, respectively.What the documentary industry should be worried about is what the box office success of “Melania” means for filmmakers motivated to make complex nonfiction films with a worldview that disrupt the status quo and have the potential to offend President Trump and his MAGA base. Movies not like “Melania.”Eight years ago, during “the golden age of documentary,” streamers like Amazon made it clear that although they were corporate behemoths, they weren't worried about Trump, who was serving his first term as president. In 2020, Amazon reportedly spent $5 million for global rights to Garrett Bradley's documentary “Time,” about a Louisiana woman's 20-year effort to secure her husband's release from prison. 

 










That same year, the company released the documentary “All In: The Fight for Democracy” about Stacey Abrams, the first Black woman to become a major-party gubernatorial nominee in the United States. In 2019, the streamer acquired the worldwide rights to the documentary “Mayor Pete,” which followed democrat Pete Buttigieg on his presidential campaign trail, and in 2016 the company, owned by Jeff Bezos, acquired exclusive streaming rights to Raoul Peck's “I Am Not Your Negro,” a documentary about late author James Baldwin who, in the film, describes the depressing state of American race relations. Both “Time” and “I'm Not Your Negro” received Academy Award nominations.But things changed last year when not only Amazon, but also Paramount and Disney, went after the rights to “Melania.” It was a clear and deliberate signal to the documentary industry that they would not offend Donald Trump or his MAGA base with progressive documentaries.

Last month at the Sundance Film Festival, documentary filmmakers and producers discovered, according to multiple sources, that Amazon wasn't in the market to acquire and commission any documentaries. Not surprisingly, the company's 2026 budget for nonfiction fare has been used in its entirety to produce and release “Melania.”

Amazon's absence at Sundance is another blow to an industry that has been suffering to stay afloat. Not only are traditional buyers like HBO not buying or commissioning as many documentaries as they did a decade ago, but budgets across the board have also been slashed. Whole documentary divisions have been eliminated or consolidated. A24 shut down its documentary filmmaking department in May 2025.

In January, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting shut down after the Trump administration and Congress voted to defund the organization. CPB is the entity behind PBS, a cornerstone of the doc marketplace. 

 










Then there is tech billionaire Jeff Skoll, the founder and chair of the former socially conscious powerhouse production company Participant Media. Together with the late Diane Weyermann, Skoll produced and helped fund numerous documentaries like “An Inconvenient Truth ” and “RBG” that fed the public's appetite for thought-provoking subject matter. In 2024, Skoll not only closed Participant but also hosted a Donald Trump inauguration victory rally.Currently, the majority of indie documentary filmmakers are relying on an unsustainable self-distribution model and the service-deal marketplace.In Park City, documentary filmmakers, producers, and cinematographers networked, hoping to land a job or at the very least, get a lead on a potential job opportunity. But the writing is on the wall. The future of socially minded or politically progressive documentaries is in jeopardy, and there isn't a left-leaning version of Jeff Bezos to swoop down and save the industry.

Only so many documentary filmmakers and producers can be hired to make more nonfiction films for streamers about celebrities, cults, and true crime. Celebrated documentary filmmakers and producers are turning to reality television for work. Some had to work with Ratner on “Melania” to keep financially afloat. According to Rolling Stone, two-thirds of the crew members who worked on “Melania” requested that their names not be formally credited in the documentary.“I understand if a liberal is working on the movie and they don't want to be credited, but they want to feed their family,” Ratner told Variety. “I don't blame anybody for that.”It's a scary time for documentarians. Will they have to start working with the likes of Brett Ratner to make infomercials that please Donald Trump to pay the bills? The success of “Melania” suggests they might.

Other streamers like Apple, whose CEO Tim Cook attended the White House premiere of “Melania,” could potentially turn their back on the documentary community and attempt to make current event, politically minded documentaries disappear. HBO and Netflix are holdouts. Both companies still support social issue films that tackle politics. 

 










HBO's “The Alabama Solution,” a hard-hitting exposé of the brutal Alabama state prison system, and Netflix's “The Perfect Neighbor,” a film that takes aim at America's stand-your-ground laws, both received Oscar nominations in the best feature documentary category this year.” Later this year, fingers crossed, HBO will release Alex Gibney's Elon Musk documentary “Musk.”Without timely documentaries that confront power and interrogate the truth, there's a vacuum to be filled with propaganda.

Former Sundance festival director Tabitha Jackson has a brand-new gig, and it's one close to her heart (and home). Film Forum and its Board of Directors today announced that Jackson has been named director of Film Forum, beginning Monday, February 23, 2026.

Per today's press release, “Jackson is an industry veteran with over 30 years of experience in independent and non-profit media, both in the U.S. and her native England. She joins Film Forum energized by two years of research fellowships with MIT Open Documentary Lab, the Royal Shakespeare Company, Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy; and a Rockefeller Foundation residency; in which she considered both the current state of institutional trust, and mediated reality and its implications for the documentary project.”

Jackson's resume is long and eclectic, including a background in researching, producing, and directing. At Channel4, the UK's second public broadcaster, she served as a Commissioning Editor for Arts and Performance and Animation, and as an Executive Producer for Film4. 

In 2013, she became director of the Sundance Institute's Documentary Film Program, “where she oversaw non-fiction film from development to distribution, championing hundreds of documentary filmmakers, growing program funding, and implementing a more expansive artist-driven institutional approach to the art of nonfiction.”

In 2020, Jackson was named director of the Sundance Film Festival. In June 2022, two years after assuming the position after the departure of long-time festival director John Cooper, Jackson stepped down from her role at Sundance. She had, quite notably, led the festival through two pandemic-era virtual-only festivals. In September 2022, IndieWire's own co-founder Eugene Hernandez took over the role, where he continues to this day.

 










Film Forum has also been through some leadership changes in recent years. In January 2023, long-time head Karen Cooper stepped down after 51 years of steering the theater. She was succeeded by Sonya Chung, who took over the role in July 2023, and stepped down from the position at the end of 2025, after two years.

The national search for Film Forum's next director was led by a committee headed by Film Forum Board Chair Gray Coleman (Partner, Davis Wright Tremaine LLP) and HR professional Stella Strazdas (together, the executive committee of the board), facilitated by Edie Demas, Vice President, Organizational Strategy and Brenna Thomas, Search Consultant, at TOC Arts Partners.

“After a search process involving a large number of extremely qualified candidates, our board of directors and staff quickly reached a strong consensus around Tabitha, and it's no surprise, given her passion for film and history of strong management in the non-profit arts arena,” said Coleman in an official statement. “Plus she is a longtime resident of Greenwich Village and has spent years attending screenings and events at Film Forum.”

For Jackson, the move seems to be a very good fit indeed. “Independent nonprofit arthouse cinema' — those four words distill everything I've championed throughout my career. That they also describe Film Forum, my local movie theater, makes this appointment feel like coming home,” said Jackson in her own statement. “For 56 years, Film Forum has built a national and international reputation for bold curation, unparalleled repertory programming, fiercely loyal audiences — and legendary banana bread. It is an honor to step into the world built by my predecessors Karen Cooper and Sonya Chung, Artistic Directors Bruce Goldstein and Mike Maggiore, Managing Director Chad Bolton, and the rest of the incredible Film Forum staff and board, and a privilege to lead this vital space into its next chapter. Because Film Forum is where art becomes civic life — where a film can start a debate, transform the way we see, or simply remind us we're not alone in the dark.”

 










Jackson has won numerous awards, including an Emmy Award for her producing work, the Leading Light Award at the DOC NYC Visionaries Tribute in 2018, and was presented with the Trustees Award by the Grierson Trust in 2021. She is a voting member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and served three terms on the Documentary Branch Executive Committee.

Here's something notable: new marketing materials for Antoine Fuqua‘s long-awaited Michael Jackson film (just “Michael”) are playing up a specific time frame. Phrases like “early solo career” and “this is where his story begins” stand out in both the film's latest trailer and a brand-new poster.

On one hand, focusing on a more compact period of time in an iconic artist's life is smart, simply for the sake of running time. On the other, well, for someone like Jackson, it offers the chance to skirt around the darker elements of his personal life. What aren't we going to see in “Michael”? Well, considering it stars his own nephew Jaafar Jackson and is leaning so hard into the early stuff, we hazard to guess: quite a bit.

Per the film's official synopsis, it “is the cinematic portrayal of the life and legacy of one of the most influential artists the world has ever known. The film tells the story of Michael Jackson's life beyond the music, tracing his journey from the discovery of his extraordinary talent as the lead of the Jackson Five, to the visionary artist whose creative ambition fueled a relentless pursuit to become the biggest entertainer in the world. Highlighting both his life off-stage and some of the most iconic performances from his early solo career, the film gives audiences a front-row seat to Michael Jackson as never before. This is where his story begins.”

The film also stars Nia Long, Laura Harrier, Juliano Valdi, Miles Teller, and Colman Domingo, all of whom pop in its latest trailer (Domingo and Long, as Michael's conflicted parents, really shine).

As IndieWire previously reported, the film has already endured a massive legal snafu involving a big chunk of the movie, which reportedly centered on a child molestation accuser's lawsuit that the Jackson estate was not allowed to depict on film, forced filmmakers to completely reshoot and retool parts of the film, leading to it to be delayed for months indefinitely. 

Footage from the movie was even confidently teased at CinemaCon back in 2024 but was completely absent this past spring as the movie underwent its reshoots. That wait is over now, and this film has the chance to be one of the bigger box office smashes of 2026.

Lionsgate will release “Michael” in theaters (including IMAX) on Friday, April 24.

Savannah Guthrie was absent from Today on Feb. 2 as she works with local authorities in Arizona to find her mother, Nancy Guthrie, who was last seen on Jan. 31. Nancy is 84 years old and considered a “missing vulnerable adult” due to her age, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department.


	In her absence, Guthrie provided a statement that was shared by her co-anchors Craig Melvin and Sheinelle Jones. “On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers, and messages of support,” she said. “Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom. We thank law enforcement for their hard work on this case and encourage anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff's office at 520-351-4900.”


	In a news conference held on Feb. 1, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos provided further details about the case. “The scene at the house also has some concerns for us, as well,” Nanos told KVOA in Tucson. “We don't typically get the sheriff out at a scene like this, but it's very concerning what we're learning from the house. Our homicide team is out right now looking at the scene as well.” Nanos explained to reporters that missing person reports of this kind come in often, but this one stood out specifically due to the description of the scene, which has not been shared with the public.

	











	On Feb. 2, Nanos appeared at another news conference with updates on the search. “We do in fact have a crime scene,” he said, noting that there is reason to believe Nancy did not leave home on her own volition. “I need this community to step up and start giving us some calls.”

	The missing person report shared by the Pima County Sheriff's Department describes Nancy as being 5 feet 5 inches tall with a weight of 150 pounds, brown hair, and blue eyes. She was last seen near her residence near East Skyline Drive and North Campbell Avenue. Concerns about her well-being were raised after a member of her church contacted a family member when she didn't show up for services. 


	Authorities do not know what she was wearing at the time she went missing, but noted that she is not in good physical health and requires daily medication. The Guthrie family reported to authorities that Nancy does not suffer from any cognitive issues. “This is not dementia related. She's as sharp as a tack,” Nanos said. “The family wants everyone to know that this isn't someone who just wandered off.”

JFK was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas.

Is the federal government in possession of a tape that could blow the John F. Kennedy assassination wide open?

JFK, the 35th President of the United States, was shot and killed in Dallas on November 22, 1963. The assassination shocked the nation to its core.

The official story is that Lee Harvey Oswald acted as a lone gunman. Oswald was later murdered by Jack Ruby before facing a trial.

The infamous assassination has long been tied to conspiracy theories. The most notable is that there were multiple shooters, and a mysterious tape might shine a light on what happened that dark day in Dallas.

The New York Post published a fascinating piece on Sunday about the existence of a mysterious tape that captured the killing.

The tape was shot in Dallas by Orville Nix and was handed over to be analyzed in 1978. It's now believed it's under federal control, but the federal government denies having it, according to the New York Post's report.

There is now a legal battle unfolding over the tape. The Post reported a federal judge has ruled the case can proceed, and that is a step towards the footage becoming public. Nix's granddaughter, Linda Gayle Nix Jackson, also believes the tape could be worth up to $900 million, and the family's fight for it centers on the government taking it without proper compensation.

The tape could prove to be critical for one shockingly simple reason:

Nix had his camera pointed at the infamous grassy knoll as the shots ripped into the sitting President.

The grassy knoll has long been believed by some people to be the location of a second shooter, if such a person ever existed to begin with.

No clear footage has ever been released giving the public a good idea of what was happening on the grassy knoll.

If it's true that Nix's tape can still be found, and it was pointing at the grassy knoll, then it would be a game-changing development.

It would either show something sinister or show nothing on the knoll. Either way, it could be the missing piece of evidence needed to rule out or confirm the most popular conspiracy theory.

Every single piece of evidence and information tied to the JFK assassination should be made public. Maybe it proves nothing. Maybe something is found. Either way, the public deserves to see it all. Let me know what you think at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

These maps detailed the Great Mongolian Road, which included key settlements and important water sources.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The Great Mongolian Road was once a pivotal east-west Silk Road route across the Gobi Desert (a camel caravan mainstay over 100 years ago), but the route had long been lost to time. Now, a secret set of century-old Japanese military maps has revealed the route once more—and in striking detail. 

Between 1873 and 1945, the Japanese Imperial Army created gaihōzu, which roughly translates to “maps of outer lands.” Originally devised for military planning during Japan's imperial expansion efforts, they still collectively serve as one of the most comprehensive cartographic records of east and inner Asia. 

In a new study published in the Journal of Historical Geography, a team of researchers said the gaihōzu display rich detail of many territories beyond Japanese control and “now serve as geographical time capsules, preserving landscapes since transformed by modernization.” 

The research team had four map sheets from the Toa Yochizu—the “Maps of East Asia,” which were drawn between 1901 and 1922—highlighting a region starting near Mongolia's eastern border with China and moving west. The study said that while the Japanese mapmakers themselves weren't traveling the roads and mapping the terrain, they pored over known sources at the time—largely Russian and Chinese maps already in existence—and combined everything for Japanese use, showing “the remarkable accuracy of the maps and the persistence of the geographic features that shaped historical trade routes.”

The painstaking detail in the maps highlights everything from road locations and settlements right down to oases and water wells. The present-day scholars studying the map used field research to verify roughly 750 miles of the documents as exceedingly accurate, and saw that they reveal a complete infrastructure system that enabled desert caravan travel. The team noted that at least 50 pivotal points along the way—including wells, springs, and monasteries—were accurate. 

“The gaihōzu capture not merely routes but complete support systems, including water sources, terrain features, and settlements vital for navigation and survival in these harsh arid environments,” the study authors wrote. “By mapping this historical corridor, these once-secret military documents provide valuable baseline data for historical geography, cultural heritage preservation, and environmental change assessment across the landscapes of Asia.” 

The gaihōzu were classified during World War II, and while many were destroyed at the end of the war, thousands of pages were saved and sent to universities and libraries. 

Field research showed that the route connecting northern China with Central Asia included water sources spaced roughly 15 miles apart, which was the typical distance a camel caravan would have traveled in a day. At times, the mapping offered multiple routes—often based on the seasons, water availability, or security concerns—showing that over time, the Silk Road may have shifted to accommodate the needs of travelers. 

“Routes were not arbitrary lines across the desert, but carefully calibrated responses to environmental constraints,” the authors wrote. 

This gaihōzu represents the first detailed account of a lesser-known section of the Silk Road. “The gaihōzu document much more than geography: they capture the complex infrastructure of water, shelter, and orientation that made survival and trade possible across one of Eurasia's harshest corridors,” the authors wrote. “Although they were created to serve imperial ambitions, these maps have transcended their original purpose to become irreplaceable records of human geographic knowledge.”

We are writing, as the editors of the World Happiness Report 2025 (ref. 1), in response to VanderWeele and Johnson2, who argue that wellbeing cannot be effectively assessed using a single-outcome measure, and instead propose measuring multiple dimensions using a composite flourishing index. They have used such an index to compare the quality of life in different countries.

In our view, most of the individual factors that get combined in such an index are causes of wellbeing and not wellbeing itself. For example, self-ratings of health, finances, social relationships, religiosity and so on are critical to understanding why people feel the way they do. But, the resulting product is wellbeing — in other words, the quality of life as we experience it.

In adults with osteoporosis, denosumab use vs bisphosphonate use was associated with a lower risk for incident knee osteoarthritis (OA), particularly among older adults and women.

“These findings have important implications for tailoring individualized drug management of knee OA,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Zhaohua Zhu, PhD, Clinical Research Centre, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China. It was published online on January 9, 2026, in Osteoarthritis and Cartilage.

The study mainly included non-Hispanic White participants with higher socioeconomic status, which might have limited the generalizability of the findings. Residual confounding might have persisted despite propensity score matching. The study was observational in nature, and the lack of consistent longitudinal weight data might have affected the results.

The study received financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China. One author reported consulting roles on scientific advisory boards for several pharmaceutical and therapeutic companies, including Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Company, TissueGene, and others, outside the submitted work.

England are to base themselves at a £197-a-night boutique hotel as they seek to end their World Cup drought.

Thomas Tuchel and his squad will shun the bright lights of big cities such as New York and Miami and make Kansas City their home for the tournament, which is being held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

And sources in the US have disclosed to Daily Mail Sport that Tuchel, Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham – should he make it – will head for a parkside inn on the outskirts of the Missouri city which describes itself as being in the style of ‘an English Cottage'.

The Three Lions have blocked out bookings at The Inn at Meadowbrook, a boutique facility on the grounds of a former country club which can come in at less than £200 per one-night stay.

With 54 rooms, the hotel offers ‘contemporary charm', according to its website, and features an outdoor pool and hot tub.

However, there is no longer a golf course, which may disappoint the likes of Kane, who is said to play off three. There are a host of championship courses within driving distance.

England are preparing to make their World Cup base at the charming The Inn at Meadowbrook

Thomas Tuchel may wish to gather his squad for lakeside chats at the picturesque complex near Kansas City

Prices in Kansas City tend to be lower than in major coastal centres and the hotel has a sterling reputation, boasting a 4.9 rating out of five on the TripAdvisor website, with guests hailing its luxurious touches. One solitary visitor delivered a one-star rating, complaining that there was no reading light in their superior room.

England will play their group matches in Dallas, New York and Boston and have chosen Kansas City thanks to its relatively central location. However, the Netherlands and Argentina will also be based in the Midwest city and were given a higher priority by FIFA when it came to the allocation of facilities as they are both playing matches in the area.

England decided to find a base rather than city-hop after consulting with senior players. FA officials will now set about making the hotel a home from home with a series of personalised touches. At previous tournaments, pictures of loved ones and families have been placed into rooms while, as Daily Mail Sport revealed, a comforting scent has been pumped into public areas.

Newcastle United's Anthony Gordon may be interested to hear that the Inn has a series of trails and ‘Cruiser' bikes to hire. The winger famously took a tumble while the England squad went for a bike ride at their hotel during the European Championship in Germany although the extra-wide tyres on Cruisers are designed to prevent any similar mishaps.

Tuchel himself may well be housed in the ‘Grand Suite', which features dining for eight, a fireplace and a banquette that overlooks tiered lakes. The suite also features a soaking tub and powder room. While England have kept there plans close to their chest, in what is perhaps a telltale sign, rooms are unavailable to book at the hotel throughout the duration of the tournament.

Should players wish to have a heart-to-heart or dissect performances, the hotel features a firepit situated within a courtyard. There is also a 24-hour gym, which may be needed after a visit to the hotel's restaurant. England will bring their own chefs, but in normal circumstances guests can head to American restaurant Verbena, which offers a number of tasty-looking, calorific desserts including fried apple pie, a banana croissant and bread pudding with rum caramel and a malted white chocolate mousse with candied pumpkin seed crumble, pumpkin bread crouton and pomegranate.

A well-stocked wine cellar includes a $950 Californian Red while, if England go all the way, they will find a $240 Rose champagne to toast their success.

Fittingly the hotel bills itself as styled like 'an English cottage' full of 'contemporary charm'

The publication of Deloitte's Money League raised some eyebrows, not least because it placed Manchester United eighth in the list – their lowest ever position – and below the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal. However, Old Trafford officials may well point to the recently-issued Forbes list, which claims they are the second-most valuable football club on the planet, behind only Real Madrid. 

While Deloitte focus on revenue (with United's recent numbers taking a hit thanks to under-performance on the field and a lack of Champions League football), Forbes concentrates more on the long-term value of the business. 

Liverpool were the only other English team to make the top 50 although, perhaps interestingly, in Forbes' list of the most profitable clubs United finish 11th with Tottenham Hotspur in 12th.

In attempting to justify the astronomical prices for World Cup tickets FIFA have quietly pointed out that different rules apply when it comes to the US market. A look at next weekend's Super Bowl would appear to support that point. 

The cheapest nosebleed seat to see the New England Patriots take on Seattle Seattle Seahawks comes in at close to £4,500 on resale sites. If you want one of the best views at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara on Sunday night then you are looking at around £31,000 for a lower bowl seat which does not include any corporate hospitality.

Paris Saint-Germain's assault on London is continuing with the arrival of what officials are calling ‘an experiential laboratory' in Cavendish Square.The French giants opened a store on Oxford Street back in 2023 and will later this month unveil ‘La Maison', which the club say will ‘deliver unique experiences at the crossroads of sport, culture and Parisian lifestyle'.

The offering will include a training room where visitors can take high-intensity workouts and yoga sessions, a café which offers ‘a curated coffee and patisserie experience' and a Sneaker Lab. DJs and musicians will perform on the second floor while the third will feature a tasting room and private dining.

Jean-Philippe Mateta's proposed move to AC Milan from Crystal Palace has collapsed, according to reports. The Eagles striker had first been in talks with Nottingham Forest but was closing in on a move to Italy; at the last minute, however, the Serie A side have pulled the plug. Milan have opted to walk away after medical checks revealed a knee problem.

Mateta was close to moving to Milan, with the Serie A club reaching a preliminary agreement with Palace over the weekend. That came as something of a hijack, as Nottingham Forest had also been attempting to sign the France international. Now, though, the deal has fallen through, per Sky, with Milan opting against continuing after running medical checks on the striker. 

This is despite the fact that Palace manager Oliver Glasner opted against selecting Mateta at the weekend, insisting he was not in the right frame of mind. 

He said: ""It is nothing to do right now with the transfers. He is not in the [right] place. To play makes no sense. 

“We have to protect the team and I have to protect him. That is why he will not travel with us to Nottingham.”

He added: ""Again, there is so much noise, so much speculation, so many things going on. We need every single player at their best and JP [Mateta] isn't at his best right now with all the noise that happens.

""It can be football noise, but if someone has private issues where they can't focus on football, then it makes no sense to play. He can't help the team and perform at his top level. We decided it is better not to play him.""

Mateta has been playing regularly for Palace this season and has made 23 Premier League appearances, scoring eight goals. He played 85 minutes against Chelsea in the fixture prior to the most recent weekend, but Sacha Tavolieri reports that Mateta's medical showed up an issue that will require surgery to fix, and could lead to the striker being out for as many as four months.

Palace have also been linked with Jorgen Strand Larsen of Wolves, and have bid for the striker, but it is unclear if his future will be affected by the collapse of Mateta's move.

Mateta has revealed his dream of playing in the World Cup, which may well see him put off surgery until after the tournament. 

He told Palace's website: “I'm very proud of myself. I'm very happy, and I think I deserve it, because I train very hard, with the gaffer [Oliver Glasner] as well and all the team. It's a dream come true, and I hope I will get called up again.

“It's my dream too, to go to the World Cup. I will do everything to go there. But first, you have to do a good job with Crystal Palace – every day, every game.

“I'm a very ambitious guy, and when I think about something, I try to do everything to make it come true.”

Mateta has also credited Oliver Glasner with his transformation, adding: “I think it's on him. He used to train in Germany, and when he came in, [in terms of] how we need to play I think I understood, because I'm from the German league too.

“I think it's because I play many games in the role. I think that's why people say I'm improving my hold-up play – because I know it very well now.

“I train hard every day, and I want to play every game and show him I'm ready for him, for the team, for the staff. I show them that I want to play every game.

“I think it's not only me personally, but we have a fantastic team that believes in everyone. We're just training very hard and believing in ourselves, and on the pitch we've had the results.

“I hope we will keep thinking the same and keep working hard.”

	Gary Trust



Harry Styles' “Aperture” takes the spotlight on the Billboard Hot 100, debuting at No. 1.


	The star (who celebrated his 32nd birthday a day earlier) earns his third Hot 100 leader, and second to debut in the top spot, after “As It Was” arrived at No. 1 in April 2022 to begin a 15-week reign. His first No. 1, “Watermelon Sugar,” spent a week atop the chart in August 2020.


	“Aperture,” the top-streamed song of the week, introduces Styles' fourth solo album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, due March 6. His first three sets all debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200: Harry's House (2022), Fine Line (2019) and Harry Styles (2017). (One Direction, with Styles as a member, notched four No. 1 albums in 2012-14, among five top 10s; “Aperture” is Styles' eighth Hot 100 top 10, with One Direction having scored six.)


	Meanwhile, “Man I Need” by newly crowned best new artist Grammy Award winner Olivia Dean, at No. 3 on the Hot 100, takes over as the most-heard song on radio, as it ascends to No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart.


	Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Feb. 7, 2026) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Feb. 3. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

Released at 7 p.m. ET Jan. 22, followed by the premiere of its official video Jan. 23, “Aperture” arrives on the Hot 100 with 18.2 million official streams and 27.1 million radio airplay audience impressions and sold 4,000 in the United States in its first full week of release (ending Jan. 29).


	The single launches at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart, where it's Styles' second leader, after “As It Was”; No. 19 on Radio Songs, tying “As It Was” for his highest start; and No. 4 on Digital Song Sales.


	“Aperture” instantly develops as the 1,186th Hot 100 No. 1, and the 88th to debut in the top spot.


	Reflecting warm welcomes for new music in 2026, Styles' “Aperture” is the second Hot 100 No. 1 debut so far this year. It dethrones Bruno Mars' “I Just Might,” which spent its first two weeks on the chart at No. 1 the previous two frames; this week, it drops to No. 6, while leading the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot R&B Songs charts for a third week each.


	This year marks the earliest that two songs have debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100. It surpasses 2024 by three days, as Ariana Grande's “Yes, And?” debuted atop the Jan. 27 chart that year, followed by Megan Thee Stallion's “Hiss” on the Feb. 10 survey.


	Two songs have soared in at No. 1 on the Hot 100 by the end of February in just one other year — 2011: Britney Spears' “Hold It Against Me” (Jan. 29) and Lady Gaga's “Born This Way” (Feb. 26).


	“Aperture” concurrently debuts at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Dance/Pop Songs chart. It's the first song to lead the Hot 100 and the dance ranking since the latter began in January 2025.


	“Aperture” is the first hit to top either of Billboard's main dance song charts in more than two years, since Grande's “Yes, And?” strutted in atop the Hot 100 and Hot Dance/Electronic Songs.


	Ella Langley's “Choosin' Texas” rises 3-2 for a new Hot 100 high. Notably, Columbia Records holds the chart's top two places, with Styles' “Aperture” on Erskine/Columbia and “Choosin' Texas” on SAWGOD/Columbia/Triple Tigers.


	Columbia is the first label in 2026 to claim the Hot 100's top two rungs, after being the last to do so in 2025, when Mariah Carey's “All I Want for Christmas Is You” and Wham!'s “Last Christmas,” both on Columbia/Legacy, were Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, on the Dec. 13 chart.


	Before that, Columbia last achieved the feat (with other labels having done so since) in part via Styles: on the Aug. 20, 2022, Hot 100, Beyoncé's “Break My Soul” was No. 1, directly above his “As It Was.”


	“Choosin' Texas” tops the Hot Country Songs chart for a 10th week.


	As Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” slips to No. 3 on the Hot 100 from its No. 2 best, it becomes the most prominent song on radio, rising a spot to No. 1 on Radio Songs (63.2 million, up 1%). She earns her first command on the chart, as the song also lifts 3-1 to become her first leader on Adult Pop Airplay. It ruled Pop Airplay for five weeks in January.


	“Man I Need” supplants Alex Warren's “Ordinary” atop Radio Songs, after the latter led for a record-tying 27 weeks. On the Hot 100, “Ordinary” backtracks 5-7 after 10 weeks at No. 1 beginning last June.


	Brit hits: It's a strong week for English artists in the Hot 100's upper reaches, with Styles from Redditch and Dean from London. They are the first U.K.-born acts to top the Hot 100 and Radio Songs, respectively, since Sam Smith, who did so with “Unholy” (with Kim Petras), in 2022.


	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, HUNTR/X's “Golden” holds at No. 4, after eight weeks at No. 1 beginning last August. It won at the 68th annual Grammys ceremony for best song written for visual media, marking the first Grammy victory for a song associated with Korean pop.


	Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” falls 3-5 on the Hot 100 after 10 weeks at No. 1.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, sombr's “Back to Friends” descends to No. 8 from its No. 7 high, while leading Hot Rock & Alternative Songs for a 15th week; Kehlani's “Folded” slides 8-9 after hitting No. 6; and Swift's “Opalite” keeps at No. 10, after reaching No. 2.

As anyone who's been following the non-stop Heated Rivalry press extravaganza knows, stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie wrapped up production by getting matching tattoos that read “sex sells.” It's a cheeky nod toward what first made the show a sensation—both as a fun bit of wintertime hockey smut and as a genuinely revolutionary depiction of queer sex on TV. But while physical intimacy is the hook of Heated Rivalry, it's a different quality that has turned the show into a full-on phenomenon in the month since its finale aired. Plenty of other romances have been this sexy (here's looking at you, Bridgerton), but few have been this nuanced with their character work. And it's that delicate exploration of emotional desire that has people watching the series over and over again.   

In fact, sex is the easy part for rival hockey players Shane Hollander (Williams) and Ilya Rozanov (Storrie). Their spark is immediate; it only takes them a few chance encounters and one sexually charged late-night gym session to trade ice hockey for tongue hockey. As creator Jacob Tierney so effectively captures, part of being gay in a highly homophobic world like professional hockey is being able to communicate a mutual sense of desire without outing yourself to someone unsafe. Here Shane and Ilya use longing looks and lingering touches to silently convey the same thing to one another: “I'd like to fuck you.” 

The trouble is, that act of silent communication sets them up for nearly a decade of miscommunication too. Because their initial assumption about each other is correct, they both make the tragic mistake of extrapolating it out further—of assuming they know what the other is thinking and feeling even when they don't. While Heated Rivalry could easily have been a romance about external forces conspiring to keep its two star-crossed lovers apart, the series makes the far more interesting choice to keep nearly all of its conflict internal instead. Only it's not quite clear that's what the show is doing until halfway into its run, when the character work that may have seemed thin at first is eventually revealed to be a complicated mix of idealization and repression between two young men who don't understand each other nearly as well as they think they do.   

When Shane looks at Ilya, he sees a portrait of extroverted self-confidence. Where Shane was basically raised since birth to be a humble golden boy and athletic role model for Asian-Canadians, Ilya is allowed to be loud, braggadocios, and openly cocky. He feels no pressure to be a good example; and though he hides his queerness from the public, he's not hiding anything from himself. He's been hooking up with both men and women for years now, and he's more often than not the one leading the sexual encounters with Shane too. Shane can't fathom what Ilya would have to be insecure about, so anytime Ilya pulls away or acts distant—as he does at an awards party in the show's first episode—Shane assumes he's just being a callous fuckboy. 

What Shane misses, however, is that Ilya has none of the foundational stability that Shane takes for granted. Shane has two deeply supportive parents, endless brand deals, and close friends on his hockey team. Plus, he gets to live and work in his home country, where it's safe to be openly gay. All of that feels a million miles away for Ilya, who grew up with a cruel father and brother, watched his mom die by suicide, and comes from a country where “promoting homosexuality” is illegal. 

When he steps away at the awards night, it doesn't have anything to do with Shane. He's just upset at the thought of returning to Russia to be chastised by his dad for not winning Rookie Of The Year. But because Shane can't grasp his own Canadian privilege, he misses that entirely. When Ilya tries to explain his bad mood by saying “I go home in three days,” Shane just responds, “Okay, must be nice.” Shane hears Ilya changing the subject, and Ilya hears Shane not understanding his life, which causes him to default to his survival mechanism of shoving all his unhappy emotions down even further. 

It's a beautifully subtextual exploration of the sort of real-life communication problems that actually keep people apart rather than the plot contrivances rom-coms so often reach for. And it goes both ways. For his part, Ilya doesn't understand how much his self-acceptance is a privilege. Since sex, sexuality, and no-strings-attached relationships come easily to him, he dramatically underestimates just how much Shane is struggling internally with questions of who he is, what he wants, and what that means for his future. When Ilya randomly brings up his friend with benefits, Svetlana, after a hookup, he's trying to be open about his life and invite Shane to do the same. But because he's diving into one of the topics Shane is least comfortable with, Shane perceives it as Ilya pushing him away and bragging about his girlfriend.   

As Storrie put it when asked what the show has to say about love, “Everyone's really going through their own thing. And half the time when we feel slighted by someone else, we have no idea exactly what's going on in their head.” Indeed, moments like Shane's unsent “we didn't even kiss” text or the duo's fraught post-tuna melt sex scene or their “All The Things She Said” dance-floor breakdown call to mind other sexy dramas about complex romantic yearning that have similarly sent the world into a collective obsession—like Normal People, Call Me By Your Name, and the second season of Fleabag. But what makes Heated Rivalry so unique is that it ultimately deploys all that intense character drama toward a happy ending rather than a bittersweet one. 

Part of the reason people have gone so feral for the show's last two episodes in particular is because they deliver the rare, beautiful rom-com magic of watching two people inspire each other to become better versions of themselves. Shane has to find his own form of Ilya's internal confidence, while Ilya has to learn to open up and build a foundation of stability outside of his toxic dynamic with his family. And they both need to learn to actually understand each other rather than just project onto the other. They need to talk, which is why episode five forgoes the onscreen sex entirely for a different kind of intimacy. 

It's also the episode where Storrie and Williams ratchet up their already strong performances to a new level. Particularly on rewatch, you can really appreciate how Williams totally shifts Shane's level of confidence after his girlfriend Rose Landry (Sophie Nélisse) gently but firmly ushers him out of the closet and into a new level of self-understanding. For all the beloved sequences in episode five, an underrated one involves Shane coming out as gay and pushing Ilya to admit they have something real. Tierney sets it up like a scene that's going to serve as a moment of catharsis for Shane only to unexpectedly pivot to one of catharsis for Ilya—who's suddenly talking about Russia and his family in a way he never has in the past nine years. One act of openness begets another. It's the moment Ilya mentally shifts Shane from the guy he texts for a hookup to the person he calls when his father dies—an opening of the emotional floodgates he can at first only acknowledge in Russian. (This is the standout scene in a season full of them for Storrie.) 

The other rewarding thing about Heated Rivalry is that it seldom takes the expected rom-com path. Over and over again, the show keeps setting up these potential false conflicts (Shane misinterpreting why Ilya said Svetlana's name on the phone or accidentally spilling the beans while high on painkillers) only to keep things firmly in the realm of grounded human drama. Even the external push of watching fellow hockey player Scott Hunter (François Arnaud) kiss his boyfriend Kip (Robbie G.K.) on ice is a culmination of a parallel storyline about the importance of communication and understanding. And while Shane and Ilya don't know what it took for Scott and Kip to get to that moment, the effect still ripples out to their now iconic retreat to Shane's cottage. 

After the high of episode five, there's something wonderfully anticlimactic about the Heated Rivalry finale. Shane and Ilya have accepted that they desire each other physically and emotionally. The question is whether they can both admit they want something more than that too. And, fittingly, they have to revisit their past miscommunications to get there. This time, when Shane asks about Ilya's family, Ilya opens up about losing his mom rather than burying his emotions again. And when Ilya brings up the idea of marrying Svetlana to get American citizenship, Shane digs into what he's actually trying to say rather than assuming the worst and imploding. 

Part of what makes “The Cottage” such an enchanting episode of television is the bittersweet joy of watching two people nine years into a situationship finally admit they have a mutual desire to understand and be understood. That's the breakthrough that allows Shane and Ilya to actually say the “I love you” they've both been feeling for years now. And while it's not a big rom-com moment like the one Scott and Kip get, that only makes it more earned. The finale is a reward for those who have deeply invested in the subtle character arcs that Storrie, Williams, and Tierney have been building all season. Even the very Slavic way Ilya does a full 180 from his detached playboy demeanor to a deeply loyal, supportive boyfriend as soon as he's recategorized Shane as family is a reminder of just how much cultural differences were getting in their way.

Indeed, Heated Rivalry is filled with the kind of poignantly written, brilliantly acted scene work that so often becomes the breakout moments of prestige fantasy dramas or superhero movies or sci-fi shows. But what's so special about the romance genre is that it doesn't have to smuggle its character arcs into some kind of larger plot-driven package. The character work is the story engine in a way that's singularly rewarding, whether on a first watch or a fifth. William Faulkner once said that the only thing worth writing about is “the human heart in conflict with itself.” And few shows have explored that as purely—or as carnally—as Heated Rivalry.
