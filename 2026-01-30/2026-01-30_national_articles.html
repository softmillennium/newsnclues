                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Journalist Don Lemon has been charged with federal civil rights crimes in connection with an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Friday. Lemon was arrested Thursday by federal agents in Los Angeles, where he had been covering the Grammy Awards, his attorney Abbe Lowell said. He was expected to appear in court there Friday afternoon. The veteran journalist is charged with conspiracy and interfering with the First Amendment rights of worshipers during a Jan. 18 protest at the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor. Another journalist and two protest participants were also arrested in Minnesota. Lemon, who was fired from CNN in 2023, has said he has no affiliation to the organization that went into the church and that he was there as an independent journalist chronicling protesters. AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the arrest of Don Lemon after a Minneapolis church protest. “Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,” Lowell said in a statement earlier Friday. “The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable.” “At my direction, early this morning federal agents arrested Don Lemon, Trahern Jeen Crews, Georgia Fort, and Jamael Lydell Lundy, in connection with the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota,” Bondi said on social media. Since he left CNN, Lemon has joined the legion of journalists who have gone into business for himself, posting regularly on YouTube. He hasn't hidden his disdain for President Donald Trump. Yet during his online show from the church, he said repeatedly: “I'm not here as an activist. A magistrate judge last week rejected prosecutors' initial bid to charge the veteran journalist. Shortly after, he predicted on his show that the administration would try again. That's not going to stop me from being a journalist. Go ahead, make me into the new Jimmy Kimmel, if you want. Fort, an independent journalist, livestreamed the moments before her arrest Friday on Facebook Live. “I don't feel like I have my First Amendment right as a member of the press because now the federal agents are at my door arresting me for filming the church protest a few weeks ago,” Fort said. It was not immediately clear if Fort and the two other Minnesotans who were arrested have attorneys. The arrests brought sharp criticism from news media advocates and civil rights activists. In an Instagram post, the National Association of Black Journalists said it was “outraged and deeply alarmed” by Lemon's arrest. Crews is a leader of Black Lives Matter Minnesota who has led many protests and actions for racial justice, particularly following George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis in 2020. After Trump administration officials said earlier this month that arrests would be coming in the church protest, Crews told The Associated Press there's a “tradition” of Black activists and leaders being targeted or subjected to violence. A prominent civil rights attorney and two other people involved in the protest were arrested last week. Prosecutors have accused them of civil rights violations for disrupting the Cities Church service. The Justice Department launched a civil rights investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,” referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. Lundy is an intergovernmental affairs manager in the office of Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, and is married to St. Paul City Council Member Anika Bowie. Lemon briefly interviewed Lundy, who is also a candidate for state senate, as they gathered with protesters preparing to drive to the church. “I feel like it's important that if you're going to be representing people in office that you are out here with the people,” he told Lemon, adding he believed in “direct action, certainly within the lines of the law.” Cities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads ICE's St. Paul field office. “We are grateful that the Department of Justice acted swiftly to protect Cities Church so that we can continue to faithfully live out the church's mission to worship Jesus and make him known,” lead pastor Jonathan Parnell said Friday in a statement. Under President Trump's leadership and this administration, you have the right to worship freely and safely,” Bondi said in a video posted to social media on Friday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Anti-ICE protests: Nationwide demonstrations are expected today against President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement efforts. Organizers are calling for a boycott of school, work and shopping. Other businesses posted to social media accounts they would be open but would donate their profits to groups supporting immigrants in Minnesota. Video showed students walking out of schools in both Arizona and Georgia. Aurora, Colorado, schools said they were canceling classes “due to a higher than anticipated number of staff absences.” The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has conducted previous investigations into law enforcement — including shootings, instances of potential police brutality or potential hate crimes — to make sure that the officers did not breach the rights of a victim, even if that investigation never results in charges. In such probes, federal officials keep their investigative eye towards violations of civil rights laws, while local law enforcement focus on potential state charges, such as murder, assault or anything else befitting the case. Former police officer Derek Chauvin pleaded guilty in federal court to civil rights charges. Another case: The 2023 death of Tyre Nichols after an encounter with police in Memphis, Tennessee. Five officers were convicted of various federal charges in Nichols' death. That includes one found guilty of violating Nichols' civil rights by causing bodily injury and showing deliberate indifference to medical needs, and two who pleaded guilty to violating Nichols' civil rights by causing death. CNN's Evan Perez, Hannah Rabinowitz and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this reporting. Members of the media spoke out in support of independent journalist Georgia Fort a short time ago, demanding her release and warning that journalism – and the First Amendment – are under attack. “This is wrong,” Fort's teenage daughter said tearfully about her mother's arrest. She is a mom working to provide for her children through the only way she knows how – documenting and sharing stories of the community, and truth of what's happening here every day in our state.” Former Minneapolis NAACP President Leslie Redmond called on local leadership for support at a time she described as “a state of emergency.” Remember: Fort and former CNN anchor Don Lemon are in federal custody Friday in connection to a protest they filmed where dozens of anti-ICE demonstrators rushed into a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier this month. Independent journalist and former CNN anchor Don Lemon is facing two federal charges in connection to an anti-ICE protest at a St. Paul church, according to his lawyer. Lemon's lawyer Abbe Lowell told CNN the journalist has been charged with two federal crimes: conspiring to violate someone's constitutional rights and violating the FACE Act, which prohibits the use of force or threats to intentionally interfere with someone expressing their First Amendment right to religion. Court records related to the arrest were not immediately available. Immigrant rights advocates filed a lawsuit on Friday challenging a recently disclosed policy adopted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement allowing its officers to enter the homes of people suspected of living in the United States illegally without a judicial warrant. But as President Donald Trump's administration ramped up immigration enforcement last year in its quest to carry out mass deportations, the acting head of ICE issued the memo advising its agents they could rely instead on administrative warrants. The lawsuit argues that allowing ICE officers to enter someone's home to conduct arrests, even with force, based solely on such an administrative warrant violates the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the new policy eliminated a guardrail designed to protect people's rights as ICE escalates enforcement operations in numerous states including Minnesota with aggressive tactics that several judges had ruled unlawful. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment, but a spokesperson has previously said those served with administrative warrants “have had full due process and a final order of removal from an immigration judge.” Organizers have called for a nationwide strike Friday, encouraging people to avoid shopping and walk out of school and work as a way to speak out against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Here is how demonstrators are making their voices heard today: Known as the 287(g) program, it allows ICE to authorize state and local law enforcement officers to perform specific immigration enforcement duties under ICE's supervision. “With this proposal we're sending a strong message to ICE: You will not weaponize local police officers against their own communities in the state of New York,” Hochul said in a Friday news conference in Manhattan alongside several law enforcement officials from across the state. ICE currently has 287(g) agreements with law enforcement agencies in around 40 states, data published by the agency shows. The governor's proposal does not completely ban all cooperation. Local departments would still be required to work with immigration enforcement and federal law enforcement to detain people accused of violent crimes. It would also ban ICE from using local police technology or databases to track people unless they have a judicial warrant, the governor said. Context: Hochul has called on Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to step down. The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday. Later on during Friday's press conference, Blanche appeared to backtrack from his initial confirmation. “I don't want to overstate what's happening,” Blanche said. Blanche added that it was “a standard investigation by the FBI” and said that “when there's circumstances like what we saw last Saturday, and that investigation, to the extent it needs to involve lawyers at the Civil Rights Division, it will involve those.” Read the latest from CNN Investigates: How two federal agents escalated an encounter with Alex Pretti into a deadly shooting FBI Director Kash Patel has previously referred questions about the investigation to DHS. This comes after White House aide Stephen Miller's acknowledgement that “may not have been following” proper protocol before the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti. In a post to social media platform X earlier Friday, Bondi announced Lemon's arrest, promising “More details soon.” White House Deputy Chief of Staff James Blair also reacted to Lemon's arrest in a pair of posts to X criticizing media coverage of the arrest, writing, “A federal grand jury indicted Don Lemon. President Donald Trump has yet to weigh in on Lemon's arrest. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison condemned the arrests of two independent journalists — former CNN anchor Don Lemon and Georgia Fort — in connection with an anti-ICE protest at a St. Paul church this month. The arrests “are deeply troubling and contrary to the rights our Constitution guarantees us,” he wrote in a post on X Friday morning. “In Minnesota we do not treat journalists like criminals for doing their jobs,” Ellison went on. “No one should be arrested merely for holding a camera, asking hard questions, or telling the public what we have a right to know.” “The Department of Justice already failed twice to get an arrest warrant for Don and several other journalists in Minnesota, where a chief judge of the Minnesota Federal District Court found there was 'no evidence' that there was any criminal behavior involved in their work. Read more about the arrest of Lemon and journalist Georgia Fort here. A series of rulings from the Supreme Court and federal appeals courts dominated by Trump nominees have overturned early victories secured by opponents of the immigration blitzes in California, Chicago and Minnesota. The administration's latest win came Monday, when a three-judge federal appeals court panel indefinitely paused a Minneapolis judge's decision to put tight guardrails on how agents can respond to individuals peacefully protesting Operation Metro Surge, which has sparked intense opposition in the Twin Cities and led to the fatal shooting of two US citizens by federal officers. Trump and his allies have long complained that lower court judges have acted out of bounds in cases challenging his agenda, particularly in the immigration context, over which they argue he has broad, unreviewable authority. President Donald Trump said Thursday evening that there were no plans to pull immigration enforcement agents out of Minneapolis, after border czar Tom Homan announced earlier in the day he had ordered federal immigration authorities to work on a drawdown plan. Asked if he'd be pulling back immigration agents, Trump said, “We'll do whatever we can to keep our country safe.” Pressed again if he was not pulling back, Trump said, “No, no not at all.” Trump's comments — made at the premiere of first lady Melania Trump's documentary at the Kennedy Center — followed Homan's remarks that morning that he was working on a “draw down plan” to begin reducing the number of immigration agents in the state and insisted that upholding “public safety should be paramount.” “I think he's terrific but we have to get rid of the criminals,” Trump said. Press freedom groups are condemning the arrests of journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort in connection with their coverage of an anti-ICE protest inside a Minnesota church on January 18. “These arrests under bogus legal theories for obviously constitutionally protected reporting are clear warning shots aimed at other journalists,” said Seth Stern, the chief of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation. Stern told CNN: “The answer to this outrageous attack is not fear or self-censorship. Katherine Jacobsen, the US, Canada and Caribbean program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, said Lemon's arrest “should alarm all Americans.” “Reporters in America are free to view, document, and share information with the public,” Gilbert said. Independent journalist Georgia Fort was taken into custody by federal agents Friday morning, an official who was briefed on the arrest told CNN's Sara Sidner Friday morning. Fort's arrest comes the morning after former CNN anchor and independent journalist Don Lemon was taken into custody. Both Fort and Lemon filmed dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters as they rushed into church in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier this month, interrupting a service, leading to tense confrontations. US Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed in a post this morning on X that Lemon and Fort, as well as two others, were arrested in connection with the church protest. “I don't feel like I have my first amendment right as a member of the press because now federal agents are at my door arresting me for filming the church protest a few weeks ago.” Details on what charges Fort and Lemon face weren't immediately available. “It's hard to understand how we have a constitution, constitutional rights, when you can just be arrested for being a member of the press,” Fort said before ending this morning's live video. Journalist Don Lemon was taken into custody on Thursday night in connection to a protest at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, according to his attorney. Lemon, a former CNN anchor, was with dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters as they rushed into Cities Church in St. Paul earlier this month, interrupting a church service and leading to tense confrontations. Court records related to his arrest were not immediately available. “Don Lemon was taken into custody by federal agents last night in Los Angeles, where he was covering the Grammy awards,” his attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement early Friday. “Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done. The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable.” Overnight, US President Donald Trump in a social media post referred to Alex Pretti, the man fatally shot by Customs and Border Protection agents in Minneapolis Saturday, as an “agitator and, perhaps, insurrectionist.” Noem's comments come as she faces increased scrutiny of her job performance and her initial statements on the circumstances around Pretti's killing. CNN reported earlier Thursday that President Donald Trump and his top officials have publicly and privately maintained that the president still has full confidence in Noem, even as he has moved to sideline one of his top officials on the ground, Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino, putting border czar Tom Homan in charge of immigration operations in Minneapolis.</p>

FOX Business contributor Phil Flynn reacts to the U.S. having its first $500 million sale of Venezuelan oil, the impact of the sale and more on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.' Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodriguez signed a law overhauling the nation's oil sector, opening it to privatization. Rodriguez's policy shift, aimed at luring the foreign investors needed to rework the industry, comes less than one month after the U.S. captured former Venezuelan dictatorial leader Nicolás Maduro. The acting president, who served as Maduro's vice president prior to his capture, was facing pressure from the Trump administration, which was eyeing Venezuela's oil industry after imposing sanctions. On Jan. 10, Trump hosted nearly two dozen top oil and gas executives at the White House. He said American energy companies will invest $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's "rotting" oil infrastructure and push production to record levels. Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodriguez takes part in a rally holding up a copy of a new law after lawmakers approved legislation opening the nation's oil sector to privatization, at the Miraflores Palace in Caracas, Venezuela, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026. That same day, Trump signed an executive order titled "Safeguarding Venezuelan Oil Revenue for the Good of the American and Venezuelan People," blocking U.S. courts from seizing Venezuelan oil revenues held in American Treasury accounts. We are talking about the country that we are going to give to our children," Rodríguez said of the reform, according to The Associated Press. Workers of Venezuela's state-owned PDVSA oil company rally to back an oil reform bill proposed by acting President Delcy Rodriguez to loosen state control and open the industry to private and foreign investment in Caracas, Venezuela, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026. The new law states that a private company "will assume full management of the activities at its own expense, account, and risk, after demonstrating its financial and technical capacity through a business plan approved by" Venezuela's Oil Ministry, according to the AP. Additionally, it modifies extraction taxes, setting a royalty cap rate of 30%, the AP reported. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Rodriguez on Thursday, the AP reported. A PDVSA worker of the state-owned oil company carries a cutout of former President Nicolás Maduro dressed as an oil worker during a rally to back an oil reform bill proposed by acting President Delcy Rodriguez to loosen state control and open the industry to private and foreign investment in Caracas, Venezuela, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026. "What we hope to do is transition to a mechanism that allows that to be sold in a normal way, a normal oil industry, not one dominated by cronies, not one dominated by graft and corruption," Rubio said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday. The secretary said that the U.S. would retain control of the oil revenue and that Venezuela would submit monthly budget outlining what they need funded. Subsequently, the funds will be moved into an account over which the U.S. will have oversight. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

National champion head coach Lou Holtz has reportedly entered hospice care at the age of 89. He was the head coach of the Fighting Irish for 11 seasons from 1986-1996, where he finished with a 110-30-2 record. Former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz listens before being presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Dec, 3, 2020. In 1988, Notre Dame finished with a perfect 12-0 record and claimed the Fiesta Bowl, which remains their last national championship. Holtz rose to even further prominence during his time as a college football analyst on ESPN. He played at Kent State before moving into coaching as an assistant in 1960, then got his first head coaching job in 1969 at William & Mary. Holtz later left for N.C. State, spending four seasons in Raleigh, before giving the NFL a shot. That stint didn't work out, though, as the Jets went 3-10 and he stepped down. Lou Holtz of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish looks on during an NCAA football game. In recent years, Holtz has been a stern supporter of President Donald Trump. Holtz, who spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention, was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Trump in 2020, shortly after former President Joe Biden defeated him in the election. "It's the highest honor or award you could possibly receive, and I receive it with mixed emotions. First of all, I'm humbled," Holtz told "Fox & Friends" afterward. "There are many more people far worthy than me, I can assure you. So, I'm excited to have this opportunity and at the same time, I'm excited to receive it from President Trump.

Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports on new details from the United Nations Security Council meeting after a Russian strike in Ukraine on ‘The Story.' As the Trump administration slashes funding and exits multiple international bodies over criticism that the U.N. has failed to promote U.S. interests, the United Nations is warning it could face a cash crisis by July. In a Jan. 28 letter from U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres to ambassadors, he cited record unpaid dues and rigid budget rules that have left the organization exposed. Guterres said the U.N. is trapped in a "Kafkaesque cycle" in which rigid budget rules force it to return "unspent" funds even when those contributions were never paid. He said outstanding dues reached a record $1.568 billion at the end of 2025 and that collections covered only 76.7% of assessed contributions, leaving the organization dangerously exposed. Unless collections "drastically improve," the secretary-general warned, the U.N. will not be able to fully implement its 2026 budget and could face a liquidity crisis by mid-year. President Donald Trump (L) meets with United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres during the 80th session of the UN's General Assembly (UNGA) at the United Nations headquarters on September 23, 2025, in New York City. World leaders convened for the 80th Session of UNGA, with this year's theme for the annual global meeting being "Better together: 80 years and more for peace, development and human rights." A senior diplomatic source told Fox News Digital that the secretary-general himself bears significant responsibility for the deepening crisis, arguing that warning signs had been visible long before the current shortfall. According to the source, major contributors had been pressing for efficiency and reform for years, yet meaningful action was delayed. When reforms were eventually introduced, the source said, they were applied broadly rather than through targeted cuts in areas where real savings were possible, harming even U.N. bodies considered central to the organization's mission. In January 2026, the United States formally withdrew from the World Health Organization and began exiting dozens of international bodies, including multiple U.N. entities, citing misalignment with American priorities. Separate Reuters reporting shows that U.N. bodies, including the World Food Programme and refugee agencies, are preparing layoffs and program reductions as overall contributions fall to the lowest level in a decade. Hugh Dugan, former National Security Council special assistant to the president and senior director for international organization affairs, told Fox News Digital that the current turmoil reflects long-standing structural weaknesses rather than a sudden collapse. "We've heard this before," Dugan told Fox News Digital, referring to repeated warnings from U.N. leadership over cash shortfalls. Dugan said the organization has struggled for decades with inconsistent revenue and outdated financial practices, arguing that alarmist messaging is unlikely to restore donor confidence without visible internal reforms. He said Guterres, who has roughly 11 months remaining in office, appears focused on ensuring the institution does not close on his watch. "The doors will remain open, maybe just, but that's his legacy," Dugan said. Asked about President Trump's newly announced peace board, Dugan said it should not be viewed as a competitor to the United Nations or a replacement for its charter-based system. Dugan compared it to past convening efforts such as the Clinton Global Initiative, saying it focuses on dealmaking and coordination rather than supplanting the international order. President Donald Trump during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025. Despite mounting criticism of its performance and finances, Dugan said the U.N. continues to hold one enduring advantage. Referring to the annual U.N. General Assembly debate, Dugan said, "When the U.N. calls a meeting today, it's routine to have more than 100 heads of state in the room," he said. "The power to convene is no small accomplishment."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kevin Warsh, visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations in a panel discussion on “Central Banking in an Age of Improvisation,” Nov. 28, 2011 in New York. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's nomination on Friday of Kevin Warsh to chair the Federal Reserve could bring about sweeping changes at a central bank that dominates the global economy and markets like no other. Warsh, if approved by the Senate, will be under close scrutiny from financial markets and Congress given his appointment by a president who has loudly demanded much lower rates than many economists think are justified by economic conditions. Whether he can maintain the Fed's long time independence from day-to-day politics while also placating Trump will be a tremendous challenge. Still, former associates and friends of Warsh say that he has the intellectual heft and people skills to potentially pull it off. Warsh has “a judicious temperament and both the intellectual understanding but also the hopefully diplomatic talents to navigate what is a challenging position at this point,” said Raghuram Rajan, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and formerly head of India's central bank. Warsh would replace current chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in May. Trump chose Powell to lead the Fed in 2017 but this year has relentlessly assailed him for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. “I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,” Trump posted on social media. Trump said later Friday in the Oval Office that he didn't ask Warsh to commit to cutting rates, calling such a question “inappropriate” and adding, “I want to keep it nice and pure.” The appointment, which requires Senate confirmation, amounts to a return trip for Warsh, 55, who was a member of the Fed's board from 2006 to 2011. He is currently a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on President Trump's pick to lead the Federal Reserve. In some ways, Warsh is an unlikely choice for the Republican president because he has long supported higher interest rates to control inflation. Trump, by contrast, has said the Fed's key rate should be as low as 1%, a level few economists endorse, and far below its current level of about 3.6%. More recently, however, in speeches and opinion columns, Warsh has voiced support for lower rates, seemingly coming in line with Trump's point of view. Financial markets reacted in ways that suggest investors expect Warsh could keep rates a bit higher over time. The dollar and yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys ticked higher. The biggest moves were in the volatile metals markets, where gold dropped more than 5% and silver sank more than 13%. Tillis is on the Senate committee that will consider Warsh's nomination. He added that Warsh is a “qualified nominee,” but stressed that “protecting the independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference or legal intimidation is non-negotiable.” Asked late Thursday whether Warsh could be confirmed without Tillis's support, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, “probably not.” Warsh has charged that the massive bond-buying, which was intended to lower longer-term interest rates and boost the economy, enabled Congress to ramp up spending without concern for higher borrowing costs. Instead, “Inflation is caused when government spends too much and prints too much,” he wrote in a November column in The Wall Street Journal. The announcement comes after an extended and unusually public search. The Fed's rate decisions, over time, influence borrowing costs throughout the economy, including for mortgages, car loans and credit cards. Trump has sought to exert more control over the Fed. In August he tried to fire Lisa Cook, one of seven governors on the Fed's board, in an effort to secure a majority of the board. Powell revealed this month that the Fed had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department about his congressional testimony on a $2.5 billion building renovation. In a January 2025 column in The Wall Street Journal, Warsh praised Trump's deregulatory policies and potential spending cuts, which he said would help bring down inflation. He has also suggested that artificial intelligence will boost productivity, making the economy more efficient while reducing inflation. In December, Trump wrote on social media of the need for lower borrowing costs and said, “Anyone who disagrees with me will never be the Fed chairman!” If confirmed, Warsh would face challenges in pushing interest rates much lower. The chair is just one member of the Fed's 19-person rate-setting committee, with 12 of those officials voting on each rate decision. The committee is already split between those worried about persistent inflation, who'd like to keep rates unchanged, and those who think that recent upticks in unemployment point to a stumbling economy that needs lower interest rates to bolster hiring. If the Fed cuts its short-term rate too aggressively and is seen as doing so for political reasons, then Wall Street investors could sell Treasury bonds out of fear that inflation would rise. Trump considered appointing Warsh as Fed chair during his first term, though ultimately he went with Powell. Warsh's father-in-law is Ronald Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune and a longtime donor and confidant of Trump's.</p>

Williams) Protesters across the U.S. are calling for “no work, no school, no shopping” as part of a nationwide strike on Friday to oppose the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. The demonstrations are taking place amid widespread outrage over the killing Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse who was shot multiple times after he used his cellphone to record Border Patrol officers conducting an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis. A sign at a cannabis shop indicates it is closed for the general strike to support the state's immigrant community Friday, Jan. 30, 2026, in Portland, Maine. Many other demonstrations were planned for students and others to gather at city centers, statehouses and churches across the country. People gather for a protest outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, Friday, Jan. 30, 2026, in Minneapolis. After speeches from clergy members, demonstrators marched toward the facility's restricted area, jeering at a line of DHS agents to “quit your jobs” and “get out of Minnesota.” Much of the group later dispersed after they were threatened with arrest by local law enforcement for blocking the road. Michelle Pasko, a retired communications worker, said she joined the demonstration after witnessing federal agents stopping immigrants at a bus stop near her home in Minnetonka, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. “Everyone in this country has rights, and the federal government seems to have forgotten that. A protester rallies against the presence of U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement in Maine, Friday, Jan. 23, 2026, in Portland, Maine. “We're here to protest ICE and what they're doing all over the country, especially in Minnesota,” said Logan Albritton, a 17-year-old senior at Groves. Numerous businesses announced they would be closed during Friday's “blackout.” Others said they would be staying open, but donating a portion of their proceeds to organizations that support immigrants and provide legal aid to those facing deportation. Otway Restaurant and its sister Otway Bakery in New York posted on social media that its bakery would stay open and 50% of proceeds would go to the New York Immigration Coalition. “As a small business who already took a huge financial hit this week due to the winter storm closures, we will remain open on Friday,” they posted. In Maine, where Republican Sen. Susan Collins announced that ICE is ending its surge, people gathered outside a Portland church on Friday morning, holding signs that said “No ICE for ME,” a play on the state's postal code. Grace Valenzuela, an administrator with Portland Public Schools, decried an “enforcement system that treats our presence as suspect.” She said ICE's actions brought “daily trauma” to the school system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the deposition from September 2016, Epstein repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate when asked more than a dozen questions about his relationship with former President Bill Clinton or the Clinton Foundation. Some examples of the questions asked to Epstein were to “Please describe all dinners you've ever had with Bill Clinton” and “Please list every place you and Bill Clinton have ever been together.” They also repeatedly asked Epstein whether he's heard of the Clinton Foundation and for all his interactions with it. A spokesperson for Clinton has repeatedly said the former president cut ties with Epstein before he was charged with soliciting prostitution in 2006 and didn't know about his crimes. Recently, the Clintons rebuffed a subpoena from the Republican-led House Oversight Committee to have them testify in a congressional probe related to Epstein. “Let me just be clear — they had nothing to do with this review,” Blanche said. Critics have repeatedly accused the Justice Department of withholding documents that referenced President Donald Trump and of attempting to divert attention away by implying democratic officials were involved in Epstein's alleged abuse. Blanche repeatedly denied the assertion, firmly stating that “we did not protect President Trump.” The deputy attorney general conceded, however, that “There's a hunger or a thirst for information that I do not think will be satisfied by the review of these documents. The latest tranche of Epstein documents released by the Department of Justice on Friday include fresh information about his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, including booking photos with weight and height details, as well as pictures of her New Hampshire home from search warrant requests. The newly released documents also contain dozens of Maxwell's financial records. There are documents from Maxwell-linked accounts at UBS, including one that described her investments and showed a balance of $773,775 in March 2019. There is also a letter describing a $1 million wire transfer in 2016, as well as IRS documents about her tax returns. CNN's chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid, who attended the Department of Justice's news conference announcing the release of additional documents in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, asked Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche whether additional open investigations were ongoing. Blanche said that some documents would be withheld due to “ongoing investigations.” Among the millions of pages of documents, images and videos related to Jeffrey Epstein that the Justice Department released on Friday appear to be numerous “302” forms — written documentation of interviews that the government has conducted. This is potentially significant because these 302 forms could be related to past interviews that federal agents conducted with alleged Epstein victims. Some survivors have told CNN that they have been desperately in search of information that they previously reported to the FBI about Epstein's alleged crimes and misconduct, wondering whether what they reported to law enforcement was ever acted upon. It's clear scrolling through some of the 302 forms, however, that they contain heavy redactions. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche made clear that the department sought to redact any personal identifying information about victims, among other things. The DOJ is allowed to make certain redactions, including personally identifying information of victims, child sexual abuse materials, or information that would jeopardize an active federal investigation. But lawmakers have criticized the DOJ's redactions so far, and Blanche's comments today provide members with a new opportunity to view the materials in full. The new tranches of Epstein files the Justice Department released Friday begins with a new page asking whether users are 18 years of age or older. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, announcing the release, said that the 2,000 videos and 180,000 images released are not all from Epstein or those close to him, noting that they may be explicit in nature. “They include large quantities of commercial pornography and images that were seized from Epstein's devices, but which he did not take, or that someone around him did not take,” Blanche said. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche addressed which files were withheld as new documents have been released from the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein today. Here's what he said is not in the release: “Although the act allows for withholding for items necessary to keep secret in the interest of national security or foreign policy, no files are being withheld or redacted on that basis,” Blanche added. “Today, we are producing more than 3 million pages, including more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images in total, that means that the department produced approximately three and a half million pages in compliance with the act,” Blanche said at a press conference at 11 a.m. But it's not clear whether the release of documents will conclude the year-long public outcry from critics who say the department, and Pam Bondi herself, did not follow through on their promise for transparency into what investigators had uncovered in their probe into Epstein's alleged sex trafficking. The DOJ later said that Bondi misspoke and was referring generally to documents from his case. A few months later, however, the Justice Department and FBI released a memo that affirmed Epstein died by suicide, said there was no evidence of a client list, and reneged on Bondi's promises to release investigative files. The memo sparked bipartisan outrage and eventually resulted a new transparency law passed by Congress. CNN reporters are going through them now, and as we wait to learn more details about the contents of today's release, here's a quick recap of where things stand: How we got here: Congress passed a law in November — with near-unanimous support — giving the Justice Department a December 19, 2025, deadline to release all of its files. Few files released so far: The Justice Department earlier this month said it had released 12,285 documents — less than 1% — of its Epstein-related files, with more than 2 million documents still in review. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS between January 9-12 found that few Americans are satisfied with the amount of evidence released in the Epstein case, with most saying they believe the government is intentionally holding back information. About the files: The files are made up of papers, videos, photographs and audio files that live within the FBI's main electronic case management system and largely originate from the FBI's two major investigations into Epstein, in Florida and New York, spanning decades. A July 2025 FBI memo said that the department had uncovered “more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence” during a review of the investigative materials. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche is holding a news conference now at the Department of Justice.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by LSEG. White House border czar Tom Homan vowed Thursday to remain in Minnesota leading Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations there "until the problem is gone." A former Biden administration official's social media post lamenting the death of a young child in government custody amid increased immigration operations in Minnesota drew backlash from Republicans, who seized on the fact that the death occurred during the Biden administration. Andrew Bates, who previously served as the senior deputy press secretary for former President Joe Biden, on Tuesday retweeted a post from the Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats about Anadith Danay Reyes Alvarez, an 8-year-old who suffered from sickle cell anemia and a heart condition and died in Border Patrol custody in 2023. Bates' post, and the original Senate Judiciary Committee post, prompted comments from conservatives pointing out that Alvarez died in 2023, during President Joe Biden's administration. Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, the father of Liam Ramos, is being detained with his son in Texas after being arrested by federal immigration authorities. (Obtained by Columbia Heights Public Schools/Department of Homeland Security) "What's remarkable, Andrew, is the level of pride you must have felt when posting this, completely unaware that it had happened while you worked in the White House yourself," Tim Murtaugh, who was President Donald Trump's campaign communications director in 2020, said in response to Bates. Top notch work from beginning to end." Greg Price, Trump White House rapid response manager for the first half of 2025 wrote, "Andy, remind who was in charge of the country in 2023?" It's horrible and shouldn't have happened," Bates wrote in the post's replies. "What makes me proud is that the American people are rejecting the cruelty that ICE is forcing on Americans and immigrants, putting all of us in danger. Fox News Digital reached out to Bates for comment. The series of social media posts between the White House veterans come amid heightened scrutiny of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in Minneapolis as part of Operation Metro Surge, an immigration operation that kicked off in December 2025 and dispatched thousands of ICE agents to the city. The agency recently seized 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Ramos, an Ecuadorian national whom federal officials say is in the U.S. illegally. The two are being held at a Texas immigration detention facility. The interaction between Bates and Murtaugh also comes as ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CPB) have faced increased scrutiny following the deaths of two U.S. citizens at the hands of federal agents in Minnesota. On Saturday, two CBP agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a Department of Veterans Affairs ICU nurse, while he was recording federal immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis. The agents who fired their weapons at Pretti have been placed on administrative leave in accordance with the agency's procedures, Fox News Digital previously reported. This undated photo provided by Michael Pretti shows Alex J. Pretti, the man who was shot by a federal officer in Minneapolis Jan. 24, 2026. Pretti's death came weeks after an agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, 37. Deputy Attorney Todd Blanche confirmed Friday in a press conference that the Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into Pretti's death. Meanwhile, a majority of voters believe that ICE's immigration tactics are going too far. A new Fox News poll found that 59% of voters believe the agency's immigration efforts are "too aggressive," up from the 49% who said so in July 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that if any member of Congress would like to see materials in their unredacted form, they can make arrangements with the department to do so. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche listens to President Donald Trump speak in the State Dining Room at the White House, Oct. 8, 2025, in Washington. NEW YORK (AP) — The Justice Department said Friday that it was releasing many more records from its investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein, resuming disclosures under a law intended to reveal what the government knew about the millionaire financier's sexual abuse of young girls and his interactions with rich and powerful people including Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the department was releasing more than 3 million pages of documents in the latest Epstein disclosure, as well as more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images. The files, which were being posted to the department's website, include some of the several million pages of records that officials said were withheld from an initial release of documents in December. The prospect of previously unseen records tying Epstein to famous figures has long animated online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and others who have clamored for a full accounting that even Blanche acknowledged might not be met by the latest document dump. “There's a hunger, or a thirst, for information that I don't think will be satisfied by review of these documents,” he said. He insisted that, “We did not protect President Trump. After missing a Dec. 19 deadline set by Congress to release all of the files, the Justice Department said it tasked hundreds of lawyers with reviewing the records to determine what needs to be redacted, or blacked out. Among the materials being withheld from release Friday is information that could jeopardize any ongoing investigation or expose the identities of potential victims of sex abuse. All women other than Maxwell have been redacted from videos and images being released Friday, Blanche said. Many of them were either already public or heavily blacked out. Those records included previously released flight logs showing that Trump flew on Epstein's private jet in the 1990s, before they had a falling out, and several photographs of Clinton. Neither Trump, a Republican, nor Clinton, a Democrat, has been publicly accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and both have said they had no knowledge he was abusing underage girls. Also released last month were transcripts of grand jury testimony from FBI agents who described interviews they had with several girls and young women who said they were paid to perform sex acts for Epstein. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges. In 2008 and 2009, Epstein served jail time in Florida after pleading guilty to soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. At the time, investigators had gathered evidence that Epstein had sexually abused underage girls at his home in Palm Beach, but the U.S. attorney's office agreed not to prosecute him in exchange for his guilty plea to lesser state charges. In 2021, a federal jury in New York convicted Maxwell, a British socialite, of sex trafficking for helping recruit some of his underage victims. U.S. prosecutors never charged anyone else in connection with Epstein's abuse of girls, but one of his victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, accused him in lawsuits of having arranged for her to have sexual encounters at age 17 and 18 with numerous politicians, business titans, noted academics and others, all of whom denied her allegations. Among the people she accused was Britain's Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor after the scandal led to him being stripped of his royal titles. Andrew denied having sex with Giuffre but settled her lawsuit for an undisclosed sum. Follow the AP's coverage of Jeffrey Epstein at https://apnews.com/hub/jeffrey-epstein.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran is ready to participate in “fair and just” nuclear talks with the United States amid rising tensions between the two nations, but will not be dictated to, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Friday. “We are under no circumstances willing to accept dictation or imposition,” Araghchi said at a press conference during a visit to Istanbul alongside Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. It is not clear when or in what format the potential talks could occur. Araghchi said no meeting with the US has been arranged while cautioning that such talks cannot be “conducted under threat.” He also ruled out the possibility of Tehran engaging in negotiations about what he called Iran's “defensive capabilities,” as well as its missile programme. The announcement follows renewed threats from Washington, with US President Donald Trump urging Iran on Wednesday to sign what he called an “equitable” nuclear deal or face another potential US military strike. Trump said Thursday he's been having conversations with Iranian leaders and is planning on further discussions. “I have had and I am planning on it,” he said when asked about the status of his conversations with Tehran. “We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn't have to use them.” Thousands of demonstrators were killed during recent anti-government protests in Iran after a heavy clampdown by the Iranian regime. Araghchi said Friday that Iran is “ready to re-enter the nuclear negotiations” while reiterating Tehran's long-standing position that his country's nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. The offer was made in a call between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, the Turkish presidency said. Iran warns of ‘hazardous consequences' after EU designates Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization On arrival to Istanbul, Araghchi accepted that regional issues are “extremely serious at the moment and we are facing major challenges.” “The goals stated by the United States and others make it necessary for us to hold closer consultations, review regional developments and coordinate our positions,” Araghchi told reporters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Thursday evening arrest comes after Lemon said he was there in his capacity as a journalist to report on the protest. He's charged with violating federal law during the event. On Jan. 18, protesters stormed Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, asserting the pastor was connected to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Protesters began shouting, “ICE out!” Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Friday morning that federal law enforcement arrested four individuals, including Lemon, associated with the protest. “At my direction, early this morning federal agents arrested Don Lemon, Trahern Jeen Crews, Georgia Fort, and Jamael Lydell Lundy, in connection with the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota,” Bondi said, promising “more details soon” in her post on X. The Justice Department had dropped its arrest warrant requests for Lemon and several others involved in the protest earlier this week, after federal Magistrate Judge Douglas L. Micko had also previously rejected the charges against Lemon. That panel of judges rejected the emergency decision as well. Lemon's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, railed against the Thursday arrest in a statement. “This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand. Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,” Lowell said. Lowell maintained Lemon's stance that he was doing “constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis,” reporting on the church protest. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon challenged Lemon's assertion in an interview with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson on Jan. 19. A source familiar with the matter told the Washington Examiner that the arrest occurred in Los Angeles at around 12:30 a.m. Pacific time and that Lemon was charged with conspiracy to deprive rights and a FACE Act violation. Lemon is now scheduled to appear in a Los Angeles court on Friday morning.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? If it feels like your algorithm is being hijacked by tiny, silver fish, you're not just seeing things; sardines are experiencing a cultural moment right now. It's a bit like millennials experiencing “bacon-mania” in the 2010s or Gen Z's more recent obsession with olives and pickles. The hype around sardines has gotten so big that some store owners are hiking up prices, citing increased demand and steep tariffs. Longtime sardine consumers have taken to social media to complain about the budget-friendly meal becoming more expensive and naming one culprit, in particular. “Sardines and canned fish in general being randomly expensive now — we hate you, TikTok,” wrote one X user last week. The current cultural obsession with sardines isn't being driven by memes or even insatiable cravings. It's all about health, beauty, and the Gen Z concept of “-maxxing,” the internet-slang suffix for optimizing a specific area of one's life. It's the appropriately affordable snack for an increasingly unaffordable era that has led young people to invest in their self-improvement when they can't monetarily invest in much else. Watching social media brag about their sardine consumption feels a bit uncanny. Many of us have gone our entire lives passing up sardines at the supermarket for more mainstream seafood, whether that's canned tuna or something more luxurious, like smoked salmon. That was the case for influencer Ally Renee when she began incorporating them into her diet. “I always watched my dad eating them growing up,” Renee said. Now, she's become a big proponent of sardines on her page, describing it as “skincare in a can” in one of her latest videos. She says she genuinely enjoys the taste of them, but the fact that they're filled with Omega 3's and high in protein is a “win-win.” “When I'm trying to tone up my body, it's such a good source of protein.” You'll also see sardines touted online as a way of “looksmaxxing,” “skinmaxxing,” “omega-3-maxxing,” and so on. Kim Severson, a food culture reporter for the New York Times, sees a few other things contributing to the current sardine takeover, including high-end chefs incorporating sardines in their menus and the recent rise in tourism to Portugal, “the land of tinned fish.” She added that we're also witnessing the “snack-ification of America,” where snack plates, girl dinners, and meals entirely made of side dishes have become a popular mode of serving food — and saving money. “You can eat well with these little snack bites for less.” The desire to eat well for less has driven a lot of food trends on social media since the pandemic, as people were forced to come up with creative dining options at home and on a budget. Self-proclaimed “snack plate girls” even started dedicating their pages to these protein medleys. Grocery prices continued to rise, and the snack plate came into fashion as more people embraced low-effort charcuterie boards. Severson says these sardine snack plates satisfy a “culinary itch” that consumers may not be able to scratch by spending money at fancy restaurants. But it's just one of the ways sardines have become integral to aspirational living on a budget. What was once a resource for famished soldiers during both world wars and foreign-born workers in the early 20th century has gotten a surprisingly glamorous makeover, thanks to its place in young people's skin care regimes and sophisticated meals. There are even more expensive brands, like Fishwife, which sell “premium” sardines in artful tins with preserved ingredients that have helped boost the image of sardines as luxury. However, the largely utilitarian function of sardines has seemed to remain intact. While you'll find influencers raving about sardines' briny taste, they've become more of a holy grail for wellness junkies and health nuts than something simply meant to be enjoyed. It shouldn't be so surprising that a highly nutritious but affordable food is speaking to young people from a generation that's hyper-focused on self-improvement and optimization in lieu of abundant job opportunities and wrestling with an economically uncertain future. ﻿Why the nation's movies, video games, and toys went global in 2025.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 20, 2025, claiming that birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment does not extend to children born on U.S. soil to parents who are in the country illegally or on a temporary basis, such as on a visa. Under the executive order, a child born on U.S. soil who has one parent who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident would still be granted citizenship at birth. Trump's order was challenged by numerous lawsuits, and the Supreme Court agreed to take up a class action lawsuit, titled Trump v. Barbara, in December, after the DOJ appealed multiple cases to the justices. The Justice Department submitted its brief for arguments to the high court earlier this month, followed by multiple briefs from outside groups supporting the president's side filed this week. “Henceforth, consistent with the Citizenship Clause's original meaning, the Executive Branch would not treat future children of temporarily present aliens and illegal aliens as U.S. citizens.” Various groups and lawmakers offered their friend-of-the-court briefs in favor of upholding the Trump administration's executive order this week. The Coolidge Reagan Foundation, a right-leaning group, argued in its brief that the Supreme Court “should not allow one of the most important issues of the twenty-first century to be resolved as a matter of constitutional law by accident.” “This Court should not construe this provision to inadvertently resolve the fundamentally different challenge of systemic illegal immigration in the face of the modern welfare state more than a century later without any public debate or deliberation,” the Coolidge Reagan Foundation's brief said. “Contra plaintiffs' thin historical arguments, contemporaneous sources instead support what common sense suggests: Conferring United States citizenship requires a more meaningful connection than mere presence by happenstance or illegality. That connection, originalist evidence repeatedly instructs, was parental domicile,” the coalition of states said. A decision in Trump v. Barbara is expected by the end of June, when the high court releases its final rulings on its current term.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Friday he is nominating Kevin Warsh to be the 17th chair of the Federal Reserve after Jerome Powell's term ends in May. “I am pleased to announce that I am nominating Kevin Warsh to be the CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, Trump wrote on his social media platform on Friday morning. “I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best.” In an Oval Office meeting later Friday, Trump further touted his pick, saying: “I would say that this was the perfect candidate. Looks don't mean anything, but he's got the look, right?” Warsh is a somewhat conventional candidate for Fed chair: a former Fed governor who was previously under consideration to be Treasury secretary in Trump's second term and was a candidate for the top job at the Fed during Trump's first term. Warsh, now 55, has recently shifted his stance on monetary policy. A former inflation hawk, Warsh now favors lower interest rates, according to numerous public statements he's made in recent months as Trump launched a reality-show-like spectacle for his Fed chair decision. He's also called for overhauling the central bank's workforce. “It's reasonable to assume that he told the President he favors reducing interest rates today, otherwise he would not have been nominated,” wrote Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in commentary issued Friday. “Our instincts tell us Mr. Warsh will be more preoccupied with how history will view his record than with continuing to pander to the President.” Selecting a new Fed chair is one of the most important hires any president makes – but the nomination takes on even greater importance under this president. Trump has railed against the Fed and Powell for the past year, berating Powell, his handpicked Fed chair, for not cutting rates. Earlier this month, Powell revealed in an extraordinary video statement that the Trump administration has launched a criminal investigation into the Fed and its chair. It's been no secret that Trump has been unhappy with Powell, though it's not clear he has the authority to actually fire him. However, Trump waved a termination letter in front of a group of House Republicans at an Oval Office meeting in August, according to three people familiar with the matter. Trump names his pick to replace Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve Trump's choice for central bank head caps off an extensive search process that at one point considered about a dozen people, from MAGA fixtures such as National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett to even former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, according to Scott Bessent, Trump's Treasury chief, who led the search. Bessent himself was also under consideration for the role but told Trump he'd prefer to remain in his current position. In addition to Warsh, the final four candidates were National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock's Rick Rieder. “Christopher Waller, Rick Rieder, and others, were interviewed for the Fed position. They all would have been outstanding, and have a great and unlimited future with “TRUMP.” Such amazing talent in our Country. “But, quite honestly, he is doing such an outstanding job working with me and my team at the White House, that I just didn't want to let him go. Kevin is indescribably good so, as the expression goes, ‘if you can't do better, don't try to fix it! The Senate Banking Committee will consider Warsh's nomination through a public hearing, then the broader Senate chamber will vote on whether or not to confirm him. But even that process may be tainted by the Trump administration's extraordinary criminal investigation of Powell, a red line that some key Republican senators said Trump crossed that could hold up Warsh's nomination until the investigation draws to a close. “No Republican purporting to care about Fed independence should agree to move forward with this nomination until Trump drops his witch hunts of the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve and Governor Lisa Cook,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic member of the committee, said in a statement Friday. Members of the Senate Banking Committee will almost certainly ask Warsh about his shifting policy on interest rates and any potential promises he made to Trump about setting policy. He may also get questions about his father-in-law, Republican mega-donor Ronald Lauder. Warsh worked as a White House economist in the George W. Bush administration. Although Trump is seeking deep interest rate cuts to turbo-charge US growth, some economists and analysts note that Warsh once had a track record of pushing back against policies that stimulate the economy. His own reason for resigning from the Fed in 2011 also underscores his aversion to loose monetary policy — at least before he was in the running for Fed chair this time around. “Kevin Warsh has been a monetary policy hawk his entire career and most importantly, during a time when the labor markets fell out of bed. His dovishness today stems from convenience,” analysts at Renaissance Macro Research posted on X Friday. Warsh is seen in economic and financial circles as an experienced and serious policy figure with a deep resume. As a young Fed governor, he played a key role managing the financial crisis alongside then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and former New York Fed President Timothy Geithner, who later became Treasury secretary. He was critical of quantitative easing, or large purchases of Treasury bonds to help lower long-term interest rates, saying later that such moves risked pushing up inflation and brought the Fed outside its core mandate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? But wildfires are a faster-growing and much closer threat than we may realize — burning in places that rarely used to see them. For instance, many homes that remain in the neighborhoods that burned in the historic Los Angeles wildfires last year are still considered as having “low risk” in assessments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) despite the charred remains of their neighbors showing how vulnerable they might be to embers blowing from miles away. It raises an urgent question: Do we actually know which homes face the most danger of burning? Government risk maps are too coarse for the way wildfire works now. But new tools powered by AI are giving us a clearer picture. For decades, modelers calculated wildfire risk by looking at historical patterns of wildfires, but it's increasingly evident that this vastly understates the scope of the problem. In fact, until 2023, California prohibited insurers from using forward-looking catastrophe models that included factors like future climate change to set their rates. “Wildfires have very complex dynamics, and a backward-looking approach is not sufficient,” said Firas Saleh, director of North America wildfire models at Moody's, a financial analytics firm. Now, one company, ZestyAI, says they have a new model that fills in “blind spots” in the government's fire risk calculations, providing a sharper picture of the threats wildfires can pose to individual homes. “Early on in our journey, we realized that insurance companies were writing property insurance without having a deep understanding of the properties themselves,” said Kumar Dhuvur, chief product officer at ZestyAI. They combined this information along with historical fire records and climate variables to train their AI model. This allowed them to calculate risks for specific houses. “You've got to be very granular in your assessment of risk,” Dhuvur said. “There could be whole neighborhoods where the resolution is too low and becomes a no-go zone for an insurance company.” When using its model to analyze the regions burned in Los Angeles wildfires last year, for example, ZestyAI found that more than 3,000 properties that were labeled as low or no risk in assessments from FEMA showed up as having an elevated fire risk in ZestyAI's model. ZestyAI found all of them to face greater danger. Sprawling, destructive wildfires are extracting a massive and growing toll from the global economy. This is a big jump forward from conventional fire risk models. FEMA's National Risk Index, for example, calculates threats over census tracts or counties (The National Risk Index has now been migrated into the new Resilience Analysis and Planning Tool). The dataset groups high-risk and low-risk homes together in ways that miss a lot of important differences between them. Some houses may have fire-resistant shingles and a wide defensible space that give them more protection. Others may have shared wooden fences with neighbors that create pathways for fire to travel, leaving those homes vulnerable to fires that start far away. For its part, the Federal Emergency Management Agency told Vox that the National Risk Index is intended to be a baseline, not an absolute measure of risk. “FEMA welcomes efforts by others to develop additional datasets that support communities in preparing for all hazards, including wildfires,” a FEMA spokesperson wrote in an email. But even though ZestyAI's analysis provides a clearer picture of which homes are in danger, it can still leave some important complexities of wildfires, said Hussam Mahmoud, who leads the Vanderbilt Center for Sustainability, Energy and Climate and studies risks to communities. A group of homeowners might clear a wide defensible space around their own homes, upgrade their sidings, and protect attic vents from cinders, but if one of their neighbors falls short, it could endanger the whole community when flames arrive. Even fire-resistant homes that meet upgraded construction codes can burn if they are pummeled for hours with waves of embers on hurricane-force winds, as the 2025 Los Angeles fires showed. “I think AI is a very promising technology,” Mahmoud said. Inspecting individual homes in person can yield the sharpest picture, but it's intrusive, time-consuming, and expensive to send people to examine millions of homes. And in-person inspections still don't tell the whole story. “When you're on the ground assessing buildings and looking if the building has good roof material versus good siding versus something else, you're assuming that this building is a recipient of fire,” Mahmoud said. They are not just a problem in wilderness areas that happen to spill over into cities and neighborhoods. The vast majority of wildfires are ignited by human activity, and when entire neighborhoods ignite, fires behave in hard-to-predict ways not seen in nature. That was evident as the Los Angeles fires last year engulfed coastal mansions in Pacific Palisades and entire neighborhoods in downtown Altadena. The biggest challenge may yet be getting people to acknowledge their risks at all. The home listing site Zillow last year decided to remove climate risk scores from property listings under pressure from California real estate groups that complained that the scores were hurting the resale value of some homes. It makes sense: A better map of fire dangers might not be in your interest if you're trying to sell your home and its value suddenly drops because it shows up as having a higher risk of igniting. There are more reasons why people might not want to think too hard about future fires. That's part of why there have been more permit applications to date for rebuilding in low and middle-income communities — like Altadena, for example — that burned last year, and fewer in wealthier enclaves like Pacific Palisades. “Families that are displaced from Palisades do have the wealth and means to look for alternatives as opposed to Altadena residents, for whom that's their only option,” said Minjee Kim, an assistant professor of urban planning at the University of California Los Angeles. AI and more advanced models can help us predict these risks and understand them better, but no algorithm can extinguish financial denial or do the political heavy lifting required to stop us from building tomorrow's homes in burn zones that are only getting bigger. Scientists are baffled by the results from new Arctic research. Why forecasters struggled to see this extreme winter storm coming. Australia is doing absolutely everything to protect its most iconic ecosystem — except, perhaps, the one thing that really matters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem explained the reasoning behind her previous statements regarding the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, in which she referred to him as a “domestic terrorist,” during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. First, there was the revelation that border czar Tom Homan would now lead illegal immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota. Then presidential adviser Stephen Miller revealed that agents in the state may have broken protocol during operations. Hannity pressed Noem on her past use of the phrase “domestic terrorism” when commenting on the shootings of Renee Good and Pretti. “People seem to be upset over the term ‘domestic terrorism.' “We're continuing to gather information, and the FBI leading this investigation is important to make sure we talk about both of these situations appropriately,” Noem said. “In the Renee Good situation, we have more information as it happened previously, and we'll continue to get to the truth of all of this. “And we know for a fact that we had dangerous criminals and drug traffickers, murderers, terrorists, people on the suspected and known-terrorist watchlist, that are in this country, that these officers are working so hard to get off of our streets,” Noem said. Hannity also asked Noem if there were “any lessons to be learned” from the Pretti shooting. “And we want to make sure that we not only improve protocols on the ground in chaotic and volatile situations like this, but that we continue to find the truth around this situation and get the facts to the American people and make sure that we continue to do our work every day with integrity.” Noem also emphasized that the DHS would stay the course and continue to “get criminals and dangerous people off the streets like these officers have been for months, ever since President Trump came back into office.” She also lauded the courage of federal law enforcement officers as they continue to do their jobs in such challenging situations and a tenuous political climate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was present during the FBI raid in Fulton County, Georgia, to maintain election integrity even though her office doesn't directly oversee the issue. “She's working very hard on trying to keep the election safe, and she's done a very good job,” he said of Gabbard. “They got into the votes with a signed judge's order in Georgia, and you're going to see some interesting things happening. They've been trying to get there for a long time.” Her appearance largely went unexplained, prompting outrage from Democrats. This should have people across the country absolutely shook. [Trump] tried to steal power when he lost it in 2020. We have to be prepared for all kinds of schemes and shenanigans. “Either Director Gabbard believes there was a legitimate foreign intelligence nexus — in which case she is in clear violation of her obligation under the law to keep the intelligence committees ‘fully and currently informed' of relevant national security concerns — or she is once again demonstrating her utter lack of fitness for the office that she holds by injecting the nonpartisan intelligence community she is supposed to be leading into a domestic political stunt designed to legitimize conspiracy theories that undermine our democracy,” Warner said on X. Gabbard has not explained her involvement in the case. An administration official has said she plays a “pivotal role in election security and protecting the integrity of our elections against interference, including operations targeting voting systems, databases, and election infrastructure.” When asked about his administration's immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, the president replied he would not be pulling back. His administration is facing increasing scrutiny after immigration officers killed two American citizens in Minneapolis this month. Despite the public outcry, federal personnel will not be leaving. Former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, Fed governor Christopher Waller, and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett are among the top contenders for the position. The nominee, whoever it is, will replace Jerome Powell once his term as chairman ends in May.</p>
