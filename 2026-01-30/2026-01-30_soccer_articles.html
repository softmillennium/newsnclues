                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First of all, it must be established that the January window ending in February is a shocking move. The game is gone - we now have proof. But since we're here and these things cannot be changed, it might be time for a little analysis. There hasn't been a blockbuster move yet. Whether it be a bit of reluctance due to the World Cup or a change in scouting approaches, no one - outside of Man City - is spending big. But there are a few names that could still move. U.S. international Ricardo Pepi has been in conversations. And outside of the American sphere, there's chat of a career rebirth for Raheem Sterling, and a well-deserved step up for Jean Philippe-Mateta, who has been excellent for some time now. There will also, one would imagine, be some real surprises here (we can dream). And GOAL's writers break it all down in a transfer window edition of... Tom Hindle: Mateta to somewhere or another. It seems an odd fit, but here we are. Either way, he's gotta get out of there. There's also a shout for Josh Sargent to Toronto. It's just gotten too negative to see this continuing, and if Sargent is really dug in about only going to Toronto, it would be a nightmare for Norwich to not let that happen. TH: If you'd asked a few weeks ago, it would have been Mo Salah out of Liverpool, but he needs to stick around now - especially given the injury issues the Reds have. So let's go for a slightly deeper cut and say Kalvin Phillips needs to get out of Man City. RT: It would be really nice to see Raheem Sterling land somewhere that actually cares about him. It's been so long since he's been an important piece at a club, and now that he's a free agent, he'll have different types of options for whatever his next step is. Hopefully, that next step is worthwhile because he deserves one more real run before it's all said and done. We're on that fun ole cycle where McKennie becomes pretty valuable to his club again after being almost booted out. It's a nice vibe, for now, but surely the guy has to head somewhere else after the World Cup. If this is a club that sort of looks after him, what might he be able to achieve where he's sincerely looked after? Surely, someone, whether it's Juve or elsewhere, will be willing to pay pretty good money to bring that in this summer. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting We're four months from a World Cup. Who cares if he's banging them in for PSV, Fulham, or Shrewsbury? He won't be healthy until March, and by then, the fight to get into the XI would be pretty difficult. Even if he cracks it by April, that gives him just a few short weeks with a new club to really show what he can do. Instead, he can stay at PSV, come back firing, and then make a move post-World Cup. It makes more sense for everyone, except maybe the buying club, if he does score this summer. TH: Show me a better one than Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool, dare you. TH: If only to stick with the scouse thing, it has to be Andy Carroll to Liverpool - especially after Fernando Torres left on the same day. RT: The Alexis Sanchez - Henrikh Mkhitaryan swap deal. It's not often that you see a deal that both sides lose, and it's hard to even argue which side lost more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Less than five months before the 2026 World Cup, U.S. men's national soccer coach Mauricio Pochettino indicated that he has better things to do than answer questions about ticket prices, which on some sites are approaching $9,000 per ticket. “It's not about us to provide our opinion,” Pochettino said. “Our responsibility is to play and perform on the pitch.” Pochettino said during a video conference call from FIFA offices in Coral Gables, Florida, that players and coaches have no control over ticket prices and shouldn't be expected to explain the price of admission for the tournament, which runs from June 11 to July 19. Pochettino responded to a question about American forward Timothy Weah, who said World Cup tickets were too expensive and that some fans would not be able to afford to attend the games. “Players need to talk on the pitch playing football. If FIFA does something or [makes] some decision, they know why and it is their responsibility to explain why.” Weah had told French outlet Le Dauphiné: "Football should still be enjoyed by everyone. World soccer's governing body, FIFA, has repeatedly defended its pricing, and once ticket prices hit the secondary market next week, prices could surge. “FIFA is doing an amazing job around the world, uniting people,” Pochettino added, stressing he is not a politician.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was the outcome Real Madrid must surely have dreaded. After the ignominy of falling out of the Champions League top eight on Wednesday via a defeat at Benfica — which featured the Portuguese side's goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scoring a stoppage-time header to send his team through — the two clubs have been drawn to face each other in February's play-off round. It means a first return to the Bernabeu for Jose Mourinho since leaving as Real Madrid manager in 2013. Five of the six English clubs skipped this draw as they qualified for the round of 16 via top-eight finishes in the league phase, but they now have at least a degree more clarity on who they might face when they are next in European action (more on that below). Newcastle United, the one Premier League team involved in Friday's draw, face a long trip to Azerbaijan to take on Qarabag, while elsewhere the holders Paris Saint-Germain will play fellow Ligue 1 side Monaco. While being drawn to face Benfica brings a chance for immediate revenge after the loss in Lisbon on Wednesday, few at the Bernabeu will be really looking forward to facing their former manager Mourinho again. New Madrid coach Alvaro Arbeloa and his players will be worried about it happening all over again. All the noise and spectacle that will inevitably surround Mourinho returning for the first time since his turbulent three years in charge over a decade ago adds up to more possible distraction. Adding to Arbeloa's issues are Rodrygo and Raul Asencio's suspensions for the first leg, with both having been sent off late in Wednesday's game. Centre-back Asencio's absence is particularly important, given the lack of fit defenders in the Madrid squad currently, and there is no sign of club president Florentino Perez sanctioning any emergency signings before the winter transfer window shuts on Monday. Their 2,500-mile journey to Baku, where Qarabag play their home games, is sandwiched between another two away ties, against Aston Villa in the fourth round of the FA Cup and before a trip to Manchester City in the Premier League. Talking to reporters on Friday, head coach Eddie Howe admitted Monaco, Newcastle's alternative opponents for the draw, were his preferred option because of that. In football terms, they will be confident, however, particularly after their 1-1 draw with holders PSG this week. Qarabag, the first Azerbaijani club to qualify from the Champions League group stage, drew 2-2 at home to Chelsea in November, but were thrashed 6-0 by Liverpool on Wednesday. Get through this and either Chelsea or Barcelona await Newcastle in the round of 16. Losing finalists against PSG last season, Inter started their Champions League campaign with four straight wins, only to come unstuck once the fixtures stiffened up. Things won't be easy for Juventus against Galatasaray, either. Okan Buruk's side lead the Turkish league and are always tricky customers on their day — just ask Liverpool, whose only defeat in the competition so far came at the Ali Sami Yen in September. The form table, though, does suggest these sides are heading in opposite directions: 10 of Juve's 13 points came from their past four matches, whereas Galatasaray fell off a cliff halfway through the league phase. PSG will be kicking themselves at having to contend with a two-legged play-off game, although an all-French tie against Monaco (the first time the teams have met in European competition) is one they will expect to win. After five matches, PSG were second in the Champions League table, behind only Arsenal. However, a disappointing goalless draw with Athletic Club, a surprising loss to Sporting CP and that draw at home to Newcastle on Wednesday meant they slipped out of the top eight, finishing 11th. Winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is the latest absentee, picking up a minor ankle injury against Newcastle. Monaco, who finished third in Ligue 1 last season, have struggled this campaign. They are 10th and their poor form led to Adi Hutter's sacking in October, replaced by Sebastien Pocognoli. However, they are without a win in five Ligue 1 matches since that PSG win, while they were hammered 6-1 by Real Madrid this month. They can also take comfort from last season, when they finished 15th in the Champions League table before defeating another French side, Brest, 10-0 on aggregate in the play-off stage. This is a tricky one for Borussia Dortmund, who suffered that dispiriting defeat by Inter in their last group-stage game and will now have to face another Italian side: Atalanta. The good news for Niko Kovac is that this is no longer Gian Piero Gasperini's team; Atalanta are seventh in Serie A and not as intimidating a proposition (now coached by Raffaele Palladino) as they were a few years ago. The bad news is that Dortmund are not in form. Serhou Guirassy is mired in a deep slump and his goals have dried up — just nine in the Champions League and Bundesliga combined. The defensive standard they established before German football's winter break will also need to be rediscovered. The defeats to Tottenham Hotspur and Inter on those final two European matchdays were notable for a lack of cutting edge, but also sloppiness at the back. Kovac will get some players back soon and that should help. Niklas Sule and Waldemar Anton should both be fit for Atalanta, and Daniel Svensson will return from his suspension, but Dortmund need to find some momentum, fast. It could have been a lot worse for the other German team involved in this play-off draw, Bayer Leverkusen. We saw in the crushing defeat by PSG in the autumn that this rebuilt Leverkusen, with pockets of talent but many, many new parts, are not really equipped to handle continental power. His defence is short of chemistry and the kind of understandings necessary to keep clean sheets in difficult environments — which Athens inevitably will be — and first-choice goalkeeper Mark Flekken is among the long-term injured. That league-phase game was a match Leverkusen should not have lost. Given UEFA does not like to make anything super easy, there are still plenty of eithers, ors, ifs and buts. That could set up a quarter-final against Manchester City, but Pep Guardiola's boys will be less delighted with their lot, as in all likelihood they will play either Real Madrid (assuming Mourinho's power of narrative doesn't lead Benfica to beating Madrid again) or Inter. Chelsea will be watching the play-offs with interest, because they will either meet PSG, assuming they beat Monaco, or Newcastle, assuming they beat Qarabag: assumption is the mother of all stuff-ups, but as assumptions go, those are two fairly safe ones. If they get through that, it could be another all-English quarter-final, against either Tottenham or Liverpool. Both of those Premier League sides face a fairly lively round-of-16 game, whatever happens: they are destined for the winners of either Galatasaray vs Juventus, or Club Brugge vs Atletico Madrid.</p>

It likely won't affect Tim Weah's playing time, but U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino downplayed the international player's criticism of World Cup ticket prices, on Thursday. “First of all, I think players need to talk on the pitch, playing football, not outside of,” Pochettino said Thursday during a Zoom news conference from Coral Gables, Fla. “It is not his duty to evaluate the price of the ticket. “We are sport people that only we can talk about our job and I think if FIFA does something or takes some decision, they know why, and (it) is their responsibility to explain why. But it is not about us to provide our opinion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Friday morning is usually a time when we look for lighter-hearted stories on Planet Football. Instead, we feel obliged to write about our disappointment in Mauricio Pochettino. In an interview from World Cup headquarters in Florida, USMNT manager Pochettino was asked about comments by Timothy Weah about the scandalous price of World Cup tickets. “It is too expensive,” Weah told French outlet Le Dauphine. “I am just a bit disappointed by the ticket prices. Though there are more affordable markets, average ticket prices have been widely criticised, including supporter groups from around the world. Now was the time for Pochettino to publicly back his own player or at least give a politician's answer of peace-keeping neutrality. We are sport people who can only we can talk about our job, and I think if FIFA does something or takes some decision, they know why, and [it] is their responsibility to explain why. “But it is not about us to provide our opinion. The crate of lemons was supposed to absorb this negative energy, Poch. The best-case scenario is that this was a pre-emptive measure to shut down any polarising social commentary. We suppose it worked for South Korea back in 2002, a competition where Pochettino was part of the Argentina squad eliminated in the group stages. It was a clear example of the ‘shut up and dribble' retort used against LeBron James, as if people can only have opinions on things directly related to their job. “(FIFA) is doing an amazing job around the world uniting people.” FIFA have consistently demonstrated their lack of interest in ‘doing the right things'.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It will be hard enough for Pochettino to pick the 26-player squad. But it will be just as vital to decide how many players he'll take at each position. In a few months, U.S. men's soccer team manager Mauricio Pochettino will have to make some of the toughest choices he has ever made in his decorated coaching career. It will be hard enough to pick the 26-player squad for a World Cup on home soil. But it be will just as vital to decide how many players he'll take at each position: centerback, outside back, the many kinds of midfielders, and forwards. But all those other choices will cause plenty of headaches, and debates among U.S. fans. Pochettino didn't address centerback directly, for the reason he noted above. But he did acknowledge that “if we want to play with fullbacks that go forward, we bring more forwards and less wingers.” The injury list will also matter a lot, of course. “Until we really know the possibilities of the players that we are going to have available, it's impossible to say if we are going to bring more or less” at any given position, Pochettino said. » READ MORE: Noahkai Banks knows he's getting a lot of USMNT hype, but he isn't thinking about the World Cup yet Pochettino indicated he would like to think that way, too, but players' health comes first. “It's true that now we are close to the World Cup, and it's true that it's going to be difficult to bring some new players because I think we don't have time,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All the host cities in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico are feeling the pressure of rising costs, much of it driven by inflation, an expanded tournament format, stadium upgrades required by FIFA and higher than expected security costs. Mexico's model is different still, where soaring costs are being absorbed by a massive, multi-billion-dollar national infrastructure campaign designed to draw tourists to the country long-term. Vancouver's estimated costs, meanwhile, have swelled from roughly $240-million in 2022 to $624-million shared between all three levels of government, according to the latest update from the province. Politicians in both cities now swing between celebrating the tournament's global status and bemoaning its skyrocketing costs. “The World Cup is going to make a lot of money for a lot of people, but not for the City of Toronto or Vancouver,” Toronto city councillor Josh Matlow told The Globe and Mail. Similar complaints are being heard in American host cities, but the rising costs there have not been on the same scale as those in Canada. One major difference is the U.S. host cities are using a model that isn't relying as heavily on public funds, and uses more private donors and local sponsorships in addition to whatever government dollars they can secure. Los Angeles, projected to spend more than USD$150-million on the World Cup, is running a shorter FIFA-approved celebration, before switching to smaller regional events operated outside the soccer federation's control. New York, meanwhile, has said it will charge people for entering its organized fan events. When asked if they're cutting back on fan festival spending, Canada's two host cities said they had no immediate plans to scale down these free events, or move to more budget-friendly celebrations outside of FIFA's purview. Vancouver says it will share cost estimates this spring for its FanFest events, which will include live concerts, game broadcasts and “immersive” fan experiences – all taking place at the PNE Fairgrounds at Hastings Park, with space for 25,000 people. “While we are watching other host cities, our responsibility is to make decisions based on the realities and opportunities that most benefit our local community. There is a massive demand for World Cup tickets and savvy resellers could be big winners She added that the city can offset some of those costs by selling premium tickets to FanFest events, which will include elevated seating, as well as food and commercial partnerships. Sharon Bollenbach, executive director of Toronto's bid committee, meanwhile, said the city can't yet share an estimate for its FanFest costs, but “more details will be shared as plans are solidified.” Sharon Bollenbach, executive director for FIFA World Cup 2026 at BMO Field in May, 2023.Tijana Martin/The Canadian Press Toronto's mayor Olivia Chow has questioned how the city wound up contractually obligated to host the World Cup when its costs are rising out of its control. Other cities, such as Chicago, Minneapolis and Calgary, walked away early in the bid stage when they lost their appetite to meet FIFA's financial requirements. FIFA President Gianni Infantino, United States President Donald Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum look on as Prime Minister Mark Carney draws Canada during the FIFA World Cup draw at the Kennedy Center in Washington in December, 2025.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press Those renovations, which will add 15,000 temporary seats to the 30,000-seat stadium, will include four new videoboards and upgrades to the stadium's hospitality suites, locker rooms, lighting, audio and broadcast infrastructure. A worker tends to the pitch at BMO Field in September, 2025.Sarah Espedido/The Globe and Mail Other World Cup host cities, such as Miami, didn't have to take on major stadium renovations because they had NFL facilities big enough to meet FIFA's requirements. Place, is also undergoing major renovations to meet FIFA requirements for hosting matches – including installing a temporary natural grass pitch. But unlike Toronto, which is paying for upgrades out of municipal coffers, the $196-million for stadium upgrades in Vancouver is coming from the provincial government. That's because BC Place is owned by a provincial Crown corporation, and belongs to the British Columbia government. Vancouver's host committee says inflation and security expenses have been the biggest sources of its cost increases since 2022, the year it was confirmed as one of 16 host cities. To help pay for the games, the City of Vancouver introduced a Major Events Municipal and Regional District Tax of 2.5 per cent on short-term accommodations. Youth soccer players kick a ball around on the field at B.C. While Ontario premier Doug Ford has balked at giving more World Cup funds to Toronto, B.C. Premier David Eby has doubled down on his support for the tournament's costs, saying more games in Vancouver “would not only be possible, but they would be incredibly welcome.” Vancouver is hosting seven games, while Toronto has six. FIFA, meanwhile, defends the high cost of hosting, arguing there is a long-term return that will benefit host cities. A look at past World Cups raises questions about whether these investments truly pay off, however. Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based thinktank, said 12 of the last 14 World Cups hosted since 1966 have resulted in financial losses for their host countries. The last three World Cups have had an average negative return on investment of 31 per cent, according to a recent report from the group. “FIFA justifies these high costs and lofty demands with the promise of economic returns. It says North American cities will receive a huge influx of tourists eager to spend their money on hotels, restaurants, and other parts of the local economy which will make up for the lost revenues,” the report's author, Page Gray, said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) says it remains optimistic that FIFA will rule in its favour concerning the petition against the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) over the eligibility of players used in November's World Cup play-off final, Soccernet.ng reports. Nigeria's hopes of reaching the 2026 FIFA World Cup were dealt a heavy blow when the Super Eagles lost on penalties to DR Congo at the Moulay Hassan Stadium. It was a result that appeared to condemn them to a second consecutive absence from the global tournament. However, weeks after that defeat, the NFF confirmed it had formally approached FIFA, alleging that DR Congo breached regulations by fielding ineligible players during the decisive fixture. There have been criticisms, including from former Super Eagles captain and coach Sunday Oliseh, aimed at the NFF for its attempt to claim victory over DR Congo via administrative technicalities rather than on the pitch. But the NFF insists it is not on a wild goose chase. “We have a good case,” Sanusi told Brila.net. Sanusi added that Nigeria's complaint is still being reviewed by world football's governing body and that the federation is waiting patiently for a response. The NFF's argument is based on claims that DR Congo fielded players who allegedly breached FIFA rules on eligibility, particularly around dual nationality. DR Congo have strongly denied any wrongdoing and, for now, retain their place as Africa's representatives in the inter-confederation play-offs. Under the current arrangement, DR Congo are set to compete in the inter-confederation play-off tournament scheduled for 26 and 31 March 2026 in Mexico. Alongside DR Congo, the six-team competition features Iraq, Jamaica, Suriname, New Caledonia and Bolivia. Should FIFA uphold Nigeria's petition, the Super Eagles could yet be reinstated and handed a late route back into contention for a place at the 2026 World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino didn't seem interested in commenting on one of the most-talked-about issues of the upcoming World Cup — the sky-high ticket prices fans are being forced to shell out to attend matches. The U.S. Men's National Team head coach said during a conference call Thursday that “it is not up to us to judge” the ticket pricing situation for the World Cup and that he and his players focus on “our job.” Pochettino was asked for his thoughts on concerns that ticket prices, which range from several hundred to several thousand dollars to attend matches, were too unaffordable and about comments from winger Tim Weah that he was “disappointed” by costs. And I think if FIFA does something or takes some decision, they know why, and it is their responsibility to explain why. And I think we have the organization that is over us, that is FIFA, that is doing an amazing job around the world uniting people, because I think FIFA unites people. Weah told French outlet Le Dauphiné that World Cup tickets were “too expensive.” This World Cup will be good, but it will be more of a show,” he told the outlet. “I am just a bit disappointed by the ticket prices. Lots of real fans will miss matches.” The cost of tickets at the World Cup is an increasingly charged topic that has drawn condemnation from fans across the soccer world, including from New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani. In an attempt to curb some of the negative comments, FIFA cut ticket prices for some of the participating nations' most loyal fans down to $60. Even with the high prices, it appears that tickets for the upcoming tournament, being jointly hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, are still in high demand. FIFA World Cup 2026 Executive Director of Commercial Operations Ross McCall told The California Post this week that they've received more than 500 million applications for tickets to World Cup matches. McCall told the outlet that FIFA is making “about 6.8 million” tickets available for purchase at face value, which has led to the astronomical ticket prices on the secondary market, with the Associated Press reporting last week that a ticket for the final at MetLife Stadium had been listed for more than $200,000.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Licence fee payers' money will not be used this summer Micah Richards will be on The Rest is Football podcast The BBC has made clear it will not use licence fee payers' money to help leading pundits such as Micah Richards to work for rival podcasts during this summer's World Cup. However, he has also committed to appearing on The Rest is Football podcast, which will be presented by Gary Lineker in New York. In another complication, The Rest is Football is expected to be shot to higher production standards this summer owing to a distribution deal with Netflix, which will be making the podcast available on its platforms after a £14m deal agreed last month. Netflix's deal with Lineker's production company, Goalhanger, is understood to include a commitment to produce more than 40 Rest is Football video podcasts during the World Cup, which the streaming platform will want to feature as many big-name guests as possible. Lineker will be in Netflix's New York studio throughout, with other pundits to join him when they are available. The BBC has told its pundits that it is happy for them to do other media work during the World Cup and many are expected to do so, but it will not subsidise the cost. As a result Richards's travel costs will have to be met by Netflix or Goalhanger. Despite this rise the BBC's matches will be shown on its main channels rather than on iPlayer, with UK rights shared with ITV.</p>
