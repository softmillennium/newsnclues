                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Electronic cigarettes - or vapes - can release puffs of vapor in aromatic clouds. The health risks of breathing in this secondhand or passive vapor aren't fully understood. They found that aged vapor contained fine particles with several metals and highly reactive compounds, which together produce radicals that might damage lung tissue if inhaled. Our study reveals that the chemical cocktail of metal nanoparticles and reactive peroxides in aged e-cigarette aerosols creates a unique profile of respiratory health risks, highlighting that secondhand vapor is something by-standers shouldn't have to breathe." Early studies showed that these secondhand vape aerosols contain volatile organic compounds that react with indoor ozone, creating new compounds, such as peroxides. Additionally, vape liquids and puffs commonly contain heavy metals, as well as other metals that could easily react with peroxides to produce potentially damaging compounds like free radicals. In another step toward understanding the potential health effects of secondhand vape plumes, Lin and colleagues examined how ozone indoors impacts the metal and peroxide composition of vape aerosols. They also wanted to see what happens when these substances react in wet environments, simulating what might happen inside the lungs. For their experiments, the researchers created a simplified vape liquid with one flavoring ingredient (a floral-smelling terpene) and no nicotine, loaded it into two different vape pens with refillable cartridges, and puffed it into a chamber with ozone in the air. After 90 minutes, they collected the aged aerosols for analysis. The smallest particles, classified as ultrafine particles, contained higher percentages of metals and peroxide compounds compared to larger aerosols. The aged aerosols created radicals with the ultrafine particles producing 100 times more radicals relative to their weight as compared to larger particles. Because ultrafine particles can get deep into humans' lungs and enter the sensitive, fluid-lined alveoli, the researchers say the results indicate these particles' potential to damage lung tissues and lower respiratory function. The researchers acknowledge that the study was done under controlled laboratory conditions, and more research is needed using real-world indoor environments and commercially available e-cigarette liquids. Regardless, these results suggest that repeated exposure to aged vape plumes could negatively impact lung health, especially for individuals with pre-existing lung conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, commonly referred to as COPD.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The class of anti-inflammatory drugs known as TNF-inhibitors has brought relief to many sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis, but they don't work for up to 4 of every 10 patients. New research led by Washington State University may have discovered why: a "backdoor" pathway of inflammation that sidesteps medicines that lock the front door. The research team found that a lesser-known inflammatory signal triggered by proteins known as TWEAK and Fn14 play an important role in the inflammatory response. The main protein involved in arthritis is Tumor Necrosis Factor, or TNF; over the past quarter-century, a range of biologic drugs known as TNF inhibitors, which block signaling in that pathway, have come onto the market. The new study found that TWEAK and Fn14 signaling team up with TNF to amplify inflammation. When both signals are active, inflammation surges. When the Fn14 receptor-mediated pathway is blocked, that TNF-driven surge quiets dramatically. It's kind of like a back-door entry or an alternate route. If you shut the main door for TNF, it has other ways to cause inflammation." Many of those patients have gotten effective relief from the five TNF inhibitors that have been approved by the FDA, a class of drugs that has grown rapidly since their introduction. They are also prescribed for conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and others. "These are fantastic for the majority of patients, but roughly 30% to 40% of patients don't respond," Ahmed said. The researchers wanted to explore the biological reasons that TNF inhibitors aren't always effective; it was known that TWEAK was a part of the large protein superfamily of TNF-an evolutionarily related group of proteins with a common ancestor-but the relationship between them was not well-understood. They discovered that TWEAK can exploit its own protein receptor-Fn14-to cause inflammation. "What we found was when you block Fn14 or knock down Fn14, the power of TNF to cause inflammation was reduced significantly," Ahmed said. This "crosstalk" between TNF and Fn14-the alternate route for inflammation-was first described in the new publication. Ahmed now plans to investigate a couple of different pathways for developing potential therapeutics - one would target the two inflammatory pathways together, and the other would focus on the Fn14 path. Given the role of TNF in other autoimmune diseases, further study of the Fn14 function could shine a light on other illnesses, as well, he said. "This is almost like a partner in crime for TNF," he said. TWEAK receptor (Fn14) exacerbates TNF-α-induced inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts and influences response to anti-TNF-α therapy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A preclinical study published in Nature has found evidence that the hippocampus, the brain region that stores memory, also reorganizes memories to anticipate future outcomes. The findings, from researchers at the Brandon Lab at McGill University and their collaborators at Harvard University, reveal a learning process that had not been directly observed before. The hippocampus builds maps of physical space and past experiences that help us make sense of the world. Scientists have known these maps change over time as brain activity patterns shift, a phenomenon that is currently assumed to be random. Researchers obtained these findings by tracking brain activity in mice as the mice learned a task with a predictable reward. Neural activity that initially peaked at the reward gradually shifted to earlier moments, eventually appearing before mice reached the reward." Mark Brandon, Associate Professor, McGill's Department of Psychiatry Rather than relying on traditional electrodes, which can only track neurons for short periods, the researchers used new imaging techniques that cause active neurons to glow. The Brandon Lab is among the first in Canada to use this technology, enabling the team to follow cells over several weeks and track slow changes that traditional methods often miss. Simpler forms of reward learning have long been associated with more primitive brain circuits, as famously demonstrated by Ivan Pavlov's experiments, which showed that animals can associate a cue, such as a bell, with food. The new findings suggest the hippocampus supports a more sophisticated version of this process, using memory and context to anticipate outcomes. Alzheimer's disease patients often struggle not only to remember the past but also to learn from experience and make decisions. By showing that the healthy hippocampus helps turn memories into predictions, the study offers a new framework for understanding why learning and decision-making are affected early in Alzheimer's disease and opens the door to research into how this predictive signal may fail and be restored.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UBC Okanagan researchers have advanced their work on developing a non-invasive, accessible way to reduce uncontrolled hand tremors. In a newly published study, the team has demonstrated how a new wearable device may reduce involuntary hand tremors linked with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. Hand tremors affect millions of people worldwide and can interfere with everyday activities such as eating, writing and personal care, explains Dr. Hadi Mohammadi, Professor in UBCO's School of Engineering. Current treatments often involve medication or surgery, while existing wearable devices can be costly, bulky or cause unwanted side effects. Hand tremors are among the most prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorders, causing involuntary upper-limb fluctuations that significantly impair a person's quality of life. Although not life-threatening, tremors can severely impair daily living and adversely impact psychological wellbeing." Since 2018, UBC Okanagan's Heart Valve Performance Laboratory has been researching ways to reduce hand tremor attenuation using patient-centred, mechanically driven solutions. While medications and therapy provide limited relief, wearable devices that suppress tremors offer a promising non-invasive alternative, he says. But Dr. Mohammadi's research, published recently in the Journal of Medical Engineering & Technology, takes a different approach. The lightweight, wearable brace works without the need for motors, batteries or invasive procedures-making it accessible to many people. "When worn on the hand, the system dampens involuntary fluctuations while allowing voluntary movement to continue largely unhindered." "Our goal was to develop a solution that is effective, wearable and practical for everyday use," says Dr. Dylan Goode, lab manager in the Heart Valve Performance Laboratory, which is led by Dr. Mohammadi. "By using a passive system, we can reduce tremors without adding complexity, power requirements or limiting natural movement." UBCO master's student Manthan Shah completed his thesis on this technology and notes that the orthosis is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed-addressing many of the comfort and usability limitations that have historically limited the adoption of wearable tremor suppression devices. While the results are promising, Dr. Mohammadi says the next step is clinical testing with human participants to evaluate real-world performance, comfort and impact on daily function. "This work represents a meaningful step toward improving functional independence and quality of life for people living with hand tremors," he adds. "We hope that this technology will soon be in the hands of patients in British Columbia and across Canada."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This study, which focused on the circadian protein Cryptochrome1 (CRY1), suggests that the time of day when radiotherapy is administered can significantly influence the effectiveness of treatment for certain types of cancer. Maintaining genomic stability is essential to prevent the onset of cancer. Consequently, multiple cancer treatments, such as radiotherapy, exploit this weakness by generating DNA breaks that tumor cells are unable to repair.This study shows that DNA break repair in human cells exhibits a circadian oscillation. In other words, its efficiency is not homogeneous, but varies cyclically depending on the time of day. In a normal human cycle, repair activity peaks in the early morning and then decreases gradually until nightfall, subsequently increasing again during the night. Our research has identified that this regulation depends on a central component of the biological clock, namely the CRY1 protein. This protein acts as a timer and its abundance changes naturally during the day/night cycle. In fact, the repair process reacts directly to CRY1 levels.When CRY1 levels are low (corresponding to early morning in humans), efficient DNA repair is stimulated. Conversely, when CRY1 levels increase (which occurs naturally in the afternoon/evening), repair is reduced, thereby increasing the sensitivity of cells to DNA-breaking agents such as ionizing radiation. This circadian regulation has a direct impact on cancer progression and response to radiotherapy in specific tumors. Our study findings suggest that the reduction in repair that occurs when CRY1 levels are high can be exploited therapeutically.Thus, breast cancer patients with tumors expressing higher levels of CRY1 were found to be more sensitive to radiotherapy. In addition, a retrospective analysis of patient data from the Virgen Macarena University Hospital revealed a significant difference in overall survival based on the time of irradiation: treatment in the afternoon/evening, when CRY1 levels are naturally higher, made tumor samples more sensitive to radiotherapy and improved patient prognosis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study led by researchers at Goethe University Frankfurt, part of the Rhine-Main University Alliance, shows that the failure of a key DNA repair enzyme called SPRTN not only results in genetic damage, but also triggers chronic inflammatory responses that accelerate aging and lead to developmental abnormalities. Although DNA is tightly packed and protected within the cell nucleus, it is constantly threatened by damage from normal metabolic processes or external stressors such as radiation or chemical substances. To counteract this, cells rely on an elaborate network of repair mechanisms. When these systems fail, DNA damage can accumulate, impair cellular function, and contribute to cancer, aging, and degenerative diseases. One particularly severe form of DNA damage are the so-called DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs), in which proteins become attached to DNA. DPCs can arise from alcohol consumption, exposure to substances such as formaldehyde or other aldehydes, or from errors made by enzymes involved in DNA replication and repair. Because DPCs can cause serious errors during cell division by stalling DNA replication, DNA-protein crosslinks pose a serious threat to genome integrity.The enzyme SPRTN removes DPCs by cleaving the DNA-protein crosslinks. SPRTN malfunctions, for example as a result of mutations, may predispose individuals to develop bone deformities and liver cancer in their teenage years. This rare genetic disorder is known as Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome. Its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood, and there are no specific therapies.Now a research team led by Prof. Ivan Ðikić from the Institute of Biochemistry II at Goethe University demonstrated that the loss of a functional SPRTN enzyme not only leads to the accumulation of damaged DNA in the cell nucleus. Furthermore, the cell releases messenger substances that attract immune cells, leading to chronic inflammation.The Frankfurt-led research team observed that this chronic inflammatory response is especially pronounced in the mouse embryos and persists in adulthood, particularly in the lung and liver. As a result, the mice died early or showed signs of premature aging similar to those seen in people with Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome. They not only compromise genome stability but also drive chronic inflammation that can significantly influence lifespan." Prof. Ivan Ðikić, Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University The physician and molecular biologist sees potential for the development of therapies: "In addition to Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome, there are other rare genetic diseases in which DNA-protein crosslinks play an important role. With our work, we have laid an important foundation for future therapeutic approaches to these diseases as well. By studying the underlying mechanisms of these rare diseases, we discovered a new link between DNA damage, inflammatory responses, and the lifespan of an organism. "Partners in the research project included Goethe University and Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (Institute of Molecular Biology/Professor Petra Beli and Institute of Transfusion Medicine/Professor Daniela Krause) within the Rhine-Main Universities alliance (RMU), the German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), EPFL Lausanne, Charité Berlin and the Universities of Cologne and Split (Croatia). DNA-protein cross-links promote cGAS-STING–driven premature aging and embryonic lethality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barbara Tuszynski was concerned about her vision but confident in her insurance coverage when she went to an eye clinic last May. She had a laser procedure to treat it in 2022, and she uses medicated drops in both eyes to prevent more damage. She assumed that meant her policy would cover the appointment. An optometrist tested Tuszynski's vision and took pictures of her optic nerves. Tuszynski's UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plan declined to pay for her eye appointment. How could an eye doctor be in-network and out-of-network at the same time? She said that after she complained, UnitedHealthcare representatives explained that the eye clinic was in-network under her vision plan, so her policy would cover the clinic's services related to glasses or contact lenses. But they said the clinic was not in-network for her medical insurance plan, and glaucoma treatment is considered a medical issue. Tuszynski was baffled that care for a patient's eyes would not be covered by vision insurance. She said she didn't realize that insurers can have contracts with eye clinics to provide some services but not others. UnitedHealthcare spokesperson Meg Sergel said such arrangements are common, including with non-Medicare insurance provided by employers or purchased by individuals. "I looked up my eye doctor, and it's the same thing," she said in an interview with KFF Health News. Sergel said she understood how a customer could mistakenly think vision insurance would cover all care for the eyes. She said UnitedHealthcare recommends that before undergoing treatment, patients ask care providers whether they are in-network for specific services. Otherwise, she said, to know whether a test or treatment is covered by vision insurance, "you'd have to read the nitty-gritty" of a policy. Leaders at Steinhauer Family Eye Clinic, where Tuszynski saw the optometrist, declined to comment. Casey Schwarz, senior counsel for education and federal policy at the nonprofit Medicare Rights Center, said such complications frequently come up when Medicare Advantage members try to use their insurance at eye clinics or dental offices. The federal government pays insurers to run Medicare Advantage plans for people who choose them instead of traditional Medicare. More than half of Medicare beneficiaries sign up for the private plans. Many offer routine vision and dental coverage that isn't included with traditional Medicare. "We hear from people who choose these plans because of those supplemental benefits, but there is not a lot of transparency around them," Schwarz said. "In good faith, we made an exception," Sergel said. However, Tuszynski was warned that if she received medical care from the clinic again, it would not be covered, because the clinic remains out-of-network for such services, Sergel said. "It doesn't sound like that pleased her." She said she lost sleep over the dispute and felt that it shouldn't have taken so much effort to obtain a fair outcome. "It's just been a horrible, difficult whirlwind," she said. In an ideal world, Schwarz said, Medicare would consider things like dental cleanings, eye checkups, and hearing aids as basic health care that would be covered in the same way as other medical care. But until that happens, she said, patients with any doubt should call their insurers beforehand to check whether services will be covered. "Errors can come at a cost to enrollees, unless they are willing and able to take on their insurer." Tuszynski worked for 30 years as a secretary in hospitals and at doctors' offices, so she's familiar with billing issues, she said. "If I can't sort through all this, how can anybody else do it?" She knows her $340 bill was much smaller than the medical debts many other people face. For 2026, she decided to shift out of her Medicare Advantage plan. She now is enrolled in traditional Medicare, plus a supplemental plan to help with copays and other costs. She pays $184 a month for that plan, compared with paying no separate premium for her old Medicare Advantage plan. Her glaucoma treatment will be covered at the Madison eye clinic. However, she no longer has insurance coverage for eyeglasses, just a discount plan if she buys glasses from certain stores. She used her Medicare Advantage insurance to buy new glasses shortly before switching. "Hopefully, those will last me a while," she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in the tissue around oral cancers both increases nerve sensitivity and makes opioids less effective, according to new research published in Science Signaling. The findings point to a shared mechanism underlying both oral cancer pain and opioid tolerance-and a possible new treatment strategy for both. Repurposing existing cancer drugs that block EGFR may be a promising way to manage oral cancer pain and prevent or reverse opioid tolerance." Yi Ye, PhD, associate professor at NYU College of Dentistry and associate director of clinical research operations at NYU Dentistry's Translational Research Center Oral cancer can be extremely painful, making it difficult for patients to eat, drink, and speak. Despite the well-known side effects and risk for addiction, opioids are still seen by experts as the gold standard for treating oral cancer pain. In order to effectively manage this pain, patients often need high doses of opioids and develop tolerance more quickly than those with other forms of chronic pain, requiring larger and larger doses to treat it. When people with cancer experience pain, the severity of the pain tends to increase as a tumor grows, suggesting that there may be shared molecular drivers behind both processes-ones that could be targeted to manage both cancer and pain. In my lab, we're trying to address whether there's a common, overlapping mechanism between cancer and pain," added Ye. EGFR, a protein found on the surface of certain cells involved in promoting cell growth and division, has emerged as an important target in cancer treatment. The receptor is overexpressed in most oral cancers, and several FDA-approved drugs that block or inhibit EGFR are used to treat lung, breast, colon, pancreatic, and oral cancers. Notably, some research shows that when patients receive EGFR inhibitors to treat their cancers, they also experience rapid pain relief. In the Science Signaling study, the research team from NYU Dentistry, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and Loma Linda University School of Dentistry studied human tissue samples from patients with oral cancer as well as mice with oral cancer to better understand the role of EGFR signaling. This EGFR activation also drove signaling and hyperactivity of the glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-a well-studied pain signaling receptor that is thought to play a critical role in the development of opioid tolerance-in trigeminal ganglia and the brainstem. This new mechanistic understanding of oral cancer pain and opioid tolerance suggests a new-and not-so-new-approach to better treating oral cancer pain: EGFR inhibitors. Because these drugs have been widely studied as cancer treatments, researchers already know about their safety and side effects. "This study provides a rationale for repurposing FDA-approved EGFR inhibitors already used to treat oral cancers, shifting from symptomatic suppression to mechanistic intervention. This approach may offer dual benefits, controlling cancer while addressing pain through a non-opioid, biologically rational approach that could dramatically improve quality of life," said Moran Amit, MD, PhD, assistant professor of head and neck surgery at MD Anderson. In addition, leveraging an existing clinical trial on EGFR inhibitors in oral cancer regression, the team plans to retrospectively evaluate the impact of EGFR inhibitors on pain relief using clinical records. "In drug development, it can take decades for a new compound to actually reach the market. If our mechanism holds true in future studies, repurposing EGFR inhibitors is appealing because it could lead to rapid translation and quickly help patients," said Ye. "These findings could significantly impact the way we treat cancer pain, providing a targeted approach that mitigates the detrimental side effects seen with opioids. This new treatment approach provides hope to both patients and clinicians treating oral cancer alike," said study author Chi Viet, DDS, MD, PhD, associate professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry. Additional study authors include Naijiang Liu, Xiaojie Shi, Maria Daniela Santi, Maria Fernanda Pessano Fialho, Rocco Latorre, and Nigel Bunnett of NYU Dentistry; Shao-Rui Chen, Hong Chen, Tongxin Xie, and Frederico Gleber-Netto of MD Anderson; and Dong Minh Phuong of Loma Linda University School of Dentistry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have developed a way to grow a highly specialized subset of brain nerve cells that are involved in motor neuron disease and damaged in spinal injuries. Their study, published today in eLife as the final Version of Record after appearing previously as a Reviewed Preprint, presents what the editors call fundamental findings on the directed differentiation of a rare population of special brain progenitors – also known as adult or parent stem cells – into corticospinal-like neurons. The findings set the stage for further research into whether these molecularly directed neurons can form functional connections in the body, and to explore their potential use in human diseases where corticospinal neurons are compromised. The nervous system comprises diverse neurons with many distinctive features including shape, anatomical position, connections to other neurons (their circuitry), the genes they express, patterns of electrical conductivity, and ultimately their function. These unique subpopulations of neurons arise from tightly controlled and precise differentiation processes that direct them to transition from immature nerve stem cells to fully mature, specialised neurons. Because they are so specialised, such distinct "subtypes" of neurons are often particularly vulnerable to, or associated with neurodegenerative injuries or diseases. "To realistically model diseases and screen for potential treatments, or to regenerate neurons that are damaged in spinal injuries, we need reliable approaches to accurately differentiate progenitor cells into these specific types of neurons," explains co-lead author Kadir Ozkan, who at the time of the study was a Postdoctoral Fellow in senior author Jeffrey Macklis' lab at the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, and Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, US. "Generic or regionally similar neurons do not adequately reflect the selective vulnerability of neuron subtypes in most human neurodegenerative diseases or injuries." Corticospinal neurons are crucial cells that degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of motor neuron disease. This critically limits the relevance of much existing research." Building on that work, the team has identified a subset of progenitor cells in the postnatal and adult cortex that can be captured and differentiated in the lab into neurons with unique characteristics of corticospinal neurons. "Knowing that a subset of early progenitors and glial cells in the cortex share a common ancestry with cortical 'projection neurons', we hypothesised that some of these progenitors might retain dormant neurogenic potential – that is, the potential to differentiate into neurons," explains co-lead author Hari Padmanabhan, who was also a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Macklis Lab at the time of the study. The team found that a subset of progenitor cells producing two important regulatory molecules, Sox6 and Neuron/Glia Antigen 2 (Sox6+/NG2+ cells), are poised to develop into neurons. The system enabled them to drive cells down a highly specific differentiation route where they acquire the hallmark characteristics of corticospinal neurons, rather than the features of other types of central nervous system neurons. By contrast, a widely employed approach to differentiate neuron-like cells by switching on just the Neurogenin2 gene resulted in cells of a mixed identity with abnormal forms (morphology) and molecular features. eLife's editors note that, as the study demonstrates reprogramming in vitro only – that is, not using living model organisms – future research is needed to assess how these reprogrammed corticospinal neurons integrate and function under physiological conditions and in models of trauma or neurodegeneration. "We have identified a subset of cortical progenitor cells with strong potential to differentiate into specialised neurons for disease modelling in ALS and spinal cord injury, and for regenerative therapies," concludes Macklis. "Importantly, SOX6+/NG2+ progenitor cells are widely distributed in the cortex, already positioned near sites of degeneration or pathology. This adds substantially to their therapeutic potential, pending further study, including with human pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical progenitors." Directed differentiation of functional corticospinal-like neurons from endogenous SOX6+/NG2+ cortical progenitors.
