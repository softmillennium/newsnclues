                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic turned back the clock once more in the early hours of Saturday morning at the Australian Open, where he snapped his five-match losing streak against Jannik Sinner in a five-set epic to move within one victory of a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title and an 11th in Melbourne. Having dropped the opening set and then slipped two sets to one behind, the recent familiar narrative threatened to repeat itself for Djokovic, who lost in the semi-finals at all four majors in 2025. Red-lining under the lights on Rod Laver Arena, he dragged himself back into the clash and outlasted the two-time defending champion 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in a gripping semi-final battle. “I am lost for words right now, to be honest,” said Djokovic, who is in his first major final since Wimbledon 2024. Playing for over four hours, it is nearly 2 am. Reminiscing about 2012 when I played Rafa in the final and that was almost six hours. The level of intensity and the quality of tennis was extremely high and I knew that was the only way for me to win tonight against him. He won the past five matches against me. He had my mobile number, so I had to change my number for tonight. “Jokes aside, I told him at the net, thanks for letting me have at least one [win]. I have tremendous respect for him, an incredible player. He pushes you to the very limit, which is what he did tonight to me, so he deserves a great round of applause... Tonight has been one of the best nights, if not the best night, atmosphere and support-wise, I have had in Australia.” It marked Djokovic's first five-set match since Roland Garros in 2024, when he survived against Francisco Cerundolo. Awaiting Djokovic in Sunday's final is rival Carlos Alcaraz, who earlier endured the longest semi-final in Australian Open history, a five-hour, 27-minute marathon against Alexander Zverev, to reach his first championship match in Melbourne. I was very eager to get out on the court. "We tried to match that quality and intensity, but credit to both of those guys, battling it out. I am looking forward to seeing him in a few days."

The Italian and Spaniard had also contested the previous three Grand Slam finals, but Djokovic tore up that script on Friday, denying them the chance to become just the second pair in the Open Era to meet in four consecutive major finals, after Djokovic and Rafael Nadal between Wimbledon 2011 and Roland Garros 2012. The Serbian will carry a narrow 5-4 Lexus ATP Head2Head advantage over Alcaraz into Sunday's final, having beaten the Spaniard in the quarter-finals in Melbourne 12 months ago. Djokovic won his opening three matches in straight sets, benefited from a fourth-round walkover against Jakub Mensik and advanced again when Lorenzo Musetti retired while leading by two sets in the quarter-finals. Roger Federer is second on the list with 102. In front of an electric Rod Laver Arena crowd, Sinner showed exactly why he had won his previous five meetings with Djokovic in the first set, producing a composed and authoritative display in the opener. The 38-year-old converted his fourth break-point opportunity to move ahead 3–1, striking with renewed aggression and pinpoint accuracy down the line to force Sinner out of position and level the match. Sinner wrestled back the initiative in the third, using his touch and variation to outmanoeuvre Djokovic while winning an imposing 90 per cent (18/20) of his first-serve points. In the fourth set, Djokovic penetrated Sinner's defences with increasingly proactive hitting, upping the pace on his forehand beyond 140 km/h and saving two crucial break points at 4-3 to drag the contest into a deciding fifth set. The 101-time tour-level titlist continued to swing away in the fifth set and saved all eight break points he faced, including three from 0/40 at 4-3. He conjured up some magic of his own on return to find the key breakthrough in the seventh game before holding out for a remarkable win. However, it was third time lucky for the 38-year-old, who dropped to his knees shortly after sealing victory. "It already feels like winning tonight, but I know I will have to come back in a couple of days and fight the number 1 in the world," Djokovic said looking ahead to the final. "I hope I have enough gas to stay toe-to-toe with him, that is my desire." It is the first time since Wimbledon 2018 that both men's semi-finals have gone to five sets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz had to rouse every last ounce of energy to overcome Alexander Zverev on Friday in an Australian Open classic. After five hours and 27 minutes of back-and-forth semi-final action inside Rod Laver Arena, the Spaniard's focus quickly turned to physical recovery for Sunday's championship match. He later revealed he thought the problem was with his adductor muscle but expressed confidence that he would be raring to go for the title match against Jannik Sinner or Novak Djokovic. “Well, obviously I feel tired,” said Alcaraz, who would become the youngest man to complete the Career Grand Slam by lifting his maiden Australian Open title on Sunday, in his post-match press conference. “Obviously my body could be better, to be honest, but I think that's normal after five hours and a half. Ice bath… I'm going to have treatment with the physio now, and we will see. “Hopefully it's not going to be nothing at all, but after five-hours-and-a-half match and that high level of physically, I think the muscles are going to be tight, and I just got to do whatever it takes to be as good as I can for the final.” “This one was one of the more demanding matches that I have ever played in my career so far,” said the 22-year-old. “I think physically we just pushed each other to the limit today. I rank this one in the top position, [among] one of the best matches that I have ever won.” Alcaraz is now 15-1 in fifth sets, and he has become the youngest man to reach the final at all four Grand Slam events. “When I was younger, there were a lot of matches that I just didn't want to fight anymore or just I gave up,” said the six-time major champion. “Then I just got mature, and I just hate that feeling… Every step more, even just one second more of suffering, one second more of fighting is always worth it. So that's why I just fight until the last ball and always believe that I can come back in every situation.” Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz advanced to his maiden Australian Open final in dramatic fashion on Friday afternoon, when he overcame physical problems and rallied from the brink to secure a marathon semi-final win against Alexander Zverev. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Alcaraz overcame World No. 3 Zverev 6-4, 7-6(5), 6-7(3), 6-7(4), 7-5 after a pulsating five hours, 27 minutes inside Rod Laver Arena, the longest semi-final in tournament history. “Believing, all the time,” said Alcaraz in his on-court interview, when asked how he won the match. No matter about anything, you still have to believe in yourself all the time. Physically it was one of the most demanding matches that I have played in my short career. I had to put my heart into the match. I am extremely proud of myself with the way that I fought and came back in the fifth set.” A BATTLE ROYALE 🫡@carlosalcaraz outlasts Zverev in a battle lasting five hours and 27 minutes to reach his first @AustralianOpen final.#AO26 pic.twitter.com/a6SjWQHxCc With his victory, Alcaraz moved to within one win of becoming the youngest man to complete the Career Grand Slam (winning the singles title at all four majors). Standing between Alcaraz and that piece of history, however, is a heavyweight showdown with one of his great rivals. 2 Sinner is the two-time defending champion at Melbourne Park, while Djokovic is a record 10-time Australian Open titlist. Into his eighth championship major match, the top seed will seek his seventh major on Sunday. “I am really happy to play my first final in Melbourne,” Alcaraz said. I think it has been a great tournament so far and my level is increasing a lot. I am really grateful for the support.” Alcaraz won 78 per cent (35/45) of points at the net in his epic win, according to Infosys Stats. The 22-year-old is now 15-1 in fifth sets, while he has also taken a 7-6 lead in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Zverev. Meanwhile, Friday's agonising defeat leaves the 28-year-old Zverev still chasing his maiden Grand Slam title. The German, who was just three points from victory, was aiming to reach his fourth slam final and second consecutive in Melbourne. Alcaraz, who had not dropped a set across his opening five matches in Melbourne, appeared on course to maintain his perfect run after opening a two-set lead against Zverev. The top seed produced typically classy tennis when he needed it most, particularly when he rallied from 2-5 to clinch the second set. Alcaraz appeared to pull up and struggle with an upper right leg injury when serving at 4-4 in the third set. Alcaraz's approach of playing ultra-aggressively to shorten rallies was competitive, but it appeared not to be enough. Zverev broke his opponent's serve in the opening game of the deciding set and, after fending off five break points across three of his service games, was soon serving for the match at 5-4. Moving freely again, the Spaniard reeled off four games in a row to stun his rival and become the youngest man to reach the final at all four Grand Slams. On match point, Alcaraz powered a forehand pass low into the encroaching Zverev, before falling to his back in ecstasy as the German's volley dropped into the net.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The third-seeded German was just three points away from defeating Carlos Alcaraz in their Australian Open semi-final on Friday night, but was unable to close it out as Alcaraz rallied from 3-5 down in the fifth set to triumph. “I think we both went to our absolute limits, so somewhat I'm also proud of myself, the way I was hanging on and came back from two sets to love.

Having rallied from two sets down, the 28-year-old looked poised to complete the comeback and hand Alcaraz just a second defeat in a fifth set. However, the 28-year-old's post-match regrets did not come from his inability to serve out at 5-4 but his lack of ruthlessness more than three hours earlier in the second set. Funny enough, I don't have many regrets in the fifth set, because I was hanging on for dear life, to be honest. I think going up, being one set all, and him starting to cramp in the third set, that probably would have made a difference.” Alcaraz struggled with physical issues deep in the third set but found a way to dig in during an exhilarating fifth set. “I know my five-set record is quite good, as well. But, no, of course not," Zverev said. "It's not something you think about 5-4 serving. I had other thoughts in my mind. Basically I didn't want to fall over in the match. “No, it's not something I think about, but I know that he's fit, I know that he's very, very strong and hard to beat in long matches. He's proven that last year in Paris, I think, as well against Jannik. I always feel like on the physical side I'm quite okay as well.” Alcaraz now leads Zverev 7-6 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series and will face Jannik Sinner or Novak Djokovic in Sunday's final.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A resilient Carlos Alcaraz battled through cramping to survive Alexander Zverev, 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-7 (3), 6-7 (4), 7-5, and reach the first Australian Open final of his career.Given he's already reached finals at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open—and won them all twice each, too—he's now reached the finals of all four Grand Slams in his career.And it's historic—the 22-year-old is actually the youngest man in the Open Era to reach the final of all four majors in his career. The previous record-holder was Jim Courier, who completed his set as a slightly older 22 at Wimbledon in 1993.Alcaraz will go for even more history this coming Sunday, as winning the title in Melbourne would make him the youngest man in tennis history to complete the Career Grand Slam.

After about two hours on court it looked like things were headed in one direction in the first semifinal on Friday, after Alcaraz took the first set on the strength of one break in the ninth game, then rallied from a break down at 5-2 to clinch the second set in a tie-break, going up two sets to none.He was even two points from closing out the match late in the third set, during Zverev's 4-5 and 5-6 service games.But he began struggling with cramping during the second set and Zverev eventually pounced, sneaking out the third and fourth sets in tie-breaks. He then held for 6-5 and broke again to close out the match after a ridiculous five hours and 27 minutes on court.

He then held for 6-5 and broke again to close out the match after a ridiculous five hours and 27 minutes on court. Fittingly, Alcaraz's on-court interviewer after the match was Courier, the man whose record he had just broken. His first question: 'How in the world did you win this tennis match?'"Believing. Believing, all the time," Alcaraz replied. "I always say that you have to believe in yourself, no matter what struggles you've been through, no matter anything. You've still got to believe in yourself, all the time. Physically, it was one of the most demanding matches I have ever played in my short career, I would say. I had to put my heart into the match. "I'm just extremely proud of myself and the way that I fought, and the way that I came back in the fifth set." Believing, all the time," Alcaraz replied.

On Sunday, he'll play the winner of the second semifinal between Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic to capture the only Grand Slam title missing from his trophy cabinet. "I'm just really happy to have the chance to play my first final here in Melbourne," the six-time Grand Slam champion said. "It's something that I was pursuing a lot, chasing a lot, having the chance to fight for the title. I think it's been a great two weeks so far. I think my level has been increasing a lot. "But one thing that I've got to say—I couldn't stay here right now doing this interview without these guys," he said, gesturing to the crowd. The way you pushed me back into the match, the way you pushed me every time, every ball, every point, it's crazy. "I'm just very grateful for the support, not only in this match, but during the whole tournament. So I just can't wait. "But obviously right now my head is about recovering as much as I can," he added, "just to try to be in a good state to put a show for you guys, and see you on Sunday, I guess."
