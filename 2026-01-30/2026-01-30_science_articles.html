                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers using a synchrotron at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have been able to recover pieces of the Hipparchus star catalog that had been overwritten. Around 2,150 years ago, the father of astronomy had not only figured out how equinoxes occur, invented a scale of stellar magnitude, observed planets, discovered a nova, and made cosmic predictions that were eerily accurate—he also created what is thought to be the first star catalog to ever exist. Known as the Farnese Atlas, this Roman copy of a Greek original eternally carries Earth as his burden at the Archaeological Museum in Naples, Italy. On the marble planet are glyphs and lines that may have been copied from one of several sky globes Hipparchus made in his time. It wouldn't be until 2022 that anything else from the early astronomer's star catalog would surface, this time as erasures on an ancient manuscript. A palimpsest manuscript is one that has been erased and written over multiple times. Now, several years later, more star coordinates in the fabled catalog have been discovered in another palimpsest manuscript, the Codex Climaci Rescriptus. Led by archaeologist and translator Victor Gysembergh of Sorbonne University in Paris, France, a team of researchers at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory used X-rays generated by the facility's synchrotron to see past layers of ink that had been scratched off or otherwise erased, allowing them to decipher the original writing that indicated star coordinates from the Hipparchus catalog. The Codex Climaci Rescriptus is pieced together from at least ten different Greek and Aramaic manuscripts. “The goal is to recover as many of these coordinates as possible,” Gysembergh, who also led the 2022 deciphering efforts, recently told KQED. Despite that fragility, using a synchrotron made it possible to decode traces of star coordinates on the palimpsest. A synchrotron is a type of particle accelerator that uses electric and magnetic fields to excite electrons until they are moving at the speed of light and leaving behind intense X-ray beams. Preventing damage meant radiation needed to be kept at low levels, with X-ray pulses lasting only about ten milliseconds, and keeping targeted areas of the parchment no wider than a human hair. Seeing past so many layers is possible because different types of ink with distinct chemical compositions were used on the parchment. Though this process may be slow, it has had incredible results. What has surfaced from Hipparchus' star catalog can now be used to infer how ancient astronomers without telescopes were able to map the cosmos so precisely.
