                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bluesky released its first transparency report this week documenting the actions taken by its Trust & Safety team and the results of other initiatives, like age-assurance compliance, monitoring of influence operations, automated labeling, and more. The social media startup — a rival to X and Threads — grew nearly 60% in 2025, from 25.9 million users to 41.2 million, which includes accounts hosted both on Bluesky's own infrastructure and those running their own infrastructure as part of the decentralized social network based on Bluesky's AT Protocol. During the past year, users made 1.41 billion posts on the platform, which represented 61% of all posts ever made on Bluesky. A catch-all “other” category included 22.14% of the reports that didn't fall under these categories, or others like violence, child safety, breaking site rules, or self-harm, which accounted for much smaller percentages. However, Bluesky said that the majority of “harassment” reports included those that fell into the gray area of antisocial behavior, which may include rude remarks, but didn't fit into the other categories, like hate speech. Most of the sexual content reports (1.52 million) concerned mislabeling, Bluesky says, meaning that adult content was not properly marked with metadata — tags that allow users to control their own moderation experience using Bluesky's tools. In addition to user reports, Bluesky's automated system flagged 2.54 million potential violations. One area where Bluesky reported success involved a decline in daily reports of antisocial behavior on the site, which dropped 79% after the implementation of a system that identified toxic replies and reduced their visibility by putting them behind an extra click, similar to what X does. Outside of moderation, Bluesky noted it removed 3,619 accounts for suspected influence operations, most likely those operating from Russia. The company said last fall it was getting more aggressive about its moderation and enforcement, and that appears to be true. Last year, Bluesky took down 2.44 million items in 2025, including accounts and content. Moderators also took down 6,334 records, and automated systems removed 282. Bluesky also issued 3,192 temporary suspensions in 2025, and 14,659 permanent removals for ban evasion. Most of the permanent suspensions were focused on accounts engaging in inauthentic behavior, spam networks, and impersonation. Most of the labeling involved adult and suggestive content or nudity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billionaire tech mogul Reid Hoffman is urging his fellow tech moguls in Silicon Valley to not just condemn the killings of two American citizens at the hands of Border Patrol agents, but to stop pacifying President Trump. In posts on X and an opinion column penned for The San Francisco Standard, Hoffman writes: “We in Silicon Valley can't bend the knee to Trump. Hope without action is not a strategy ––  it's an invitation for Trump to trample whatever he can see, including our own business and security interests.” But most of them were quick to distance their concerns over this issue from the president himself. Hoffman is echoing the sentiment of a growing contingent of tech workers, who have signed a petition asking their CEOs to call the White House and demand that ICE leave U.S. cities, to cancel all company contracts with ICE, and to speak out publicly against ICE's violence. While there certainly are tech leaders who remain vocal supporters of Trump, like Elon Musk and Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures, many leaders appear to be, at least publicly, walking the fence. Cook, for instance, wrote that he was “heartbroken” and urged “de-escalation” in his internal memo, but also attended an exclusive screening of First Lady Melania Trump's documentary hours after the ICE shooting of Alex Pretti, one of the Americans killed in the incidents.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon built its in-person grocery brand on the promise that shoppers could “just walk out.” On Thursday in Seattle's Central District, they couldn't even walk right in. It was an unexpected farewell for a retail experiment built on the promise of streamlining grocery shopping. In announcing the closures, Amazon said it wasn't able to create “a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion.” The closures are part of a broader reset at Amazon, which is also laying off an additional 16,000 corporate employees this week as CEO Andy Jassy works to streamline operations. It was demolished to make way for the mixed-use Jackson Apartments development, where Amazon Fresh opened in 2021. Many people in the neighborhood don't drive and depended on having a grocery store within walking distance. He found out about the closure Tuesday from a friend who texted him an article. “I'm not a huge fan of Amazon,” he said. Some described a store that never quite caught on. Others had never set foot in an Amazon Fresh before Thursday. For them, a physical store never made much sense. Amazon Prime, one first-time store shopper said, is for delivery. Amazon says perishable grocery sales through the service have grown 40-fold since January 2025, with fresh items now making up nine of the top 10 most-ordered products in areas where it's available. It also plans to open more than 100 new Whole Foods stores over the next several years, expanding the chain it acquired for $13.7 billion in 2017. Some Fresh stores will be converted into Whole Foods. Amazon hasn't said whether 23rd and Jackson will be one. Some of the technology Amazon developed for its Fresh and Go stores will live on. For example, a redesigned version of the Dash Cart is rolling out to Whole Foods locations. The “Just Walk Out” system — which uses overhead cameras and sensors to let customers skip checkout — was phased out of Fresh stores in 2024 in favor of Dash Carts, but remained a core technology in Amazon Go convenience stores until the end. It now operates in more than 360 third-party locations, including hospitals and sports arenas. A terminal inside the 23rd and Jackson store displayed the message: “Amazon One palm authentication services will be discontinued at retail businesses on June 3, 2026.” Once we made it inside the store on Thursday afternoon, we found shelves about half empty and aisles packed with shoppers filling their carts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's rocket company is reportedly in talks to merge SpaceX with some of his other businesses, ahead of a planned initial public offering on Wall Street later this year. Several media outlets, including Bloomberg and Reuters, reported that SpaceX is considering a potential merger with Musk's electric vehicle company, Tesla. Alternatively, it's also weighing a deal with xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence company that owns the chatbot Grok and the social media platform X. There are already signs SpaceX is preparing for either scenario. Bloomberg reported that two legal entities established in Nevada include “merger sub” in their names and list SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen as an officer. SpaceX, xAI, and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo. A merger between SpaceX and either company could make sense. Musk has previously stated that one of SpaceX's ambitions is to place data centers in space. Still, Bloomberg reports that investors appear particularly excited about the idea of a Tesla merger. In contrast, a merger between the private company and xAI could come with its own more personal benefits. Neither company responded to a request for comment from Gizmodo. For its part, SpaceX is reportedly targeting a mid-June public debut to coincide with a conjunction of Jupiter and Venus near Musk's birthday. If xAI were folded into that IPO, it would give public-market investors their first direct chance to buy into a major AI startup, essentially giving Musk the first access to a bigger pool of investors. Additionally, if there really is an AI bubble going on, it wouldn't hurt to get investors on board before it bursts. Musk has had a contentious relationship with OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, for years. Musk co-founded OpenAI but later left the company in 2018, reportedly due to disagreements over the direction of what was then a nonprofit organization. Musk is now suing OpenAI and Microsoft for $134 billion, alleging “wrongful gains.” He claims he invested $38 million in OpenAI's seed funding and made significant nonmonetary contributions under the belief that the company would remain a nonprofit. Earlier this month, the company published a blog post responding to Musk's court filings, arguing that Musk had agreed that OpenAI would need to transition into a for-profit structure. If Musk gets xAI to Wall Street first, he'd almost certainly frame it as a win over OpenAI. Tesla has to make room for promises of an automated, robotic future. On a bleak earnings call, he also said “amazing medical care” is coming. Grok, which once dubbed itself Mecha Hitler, is crowned the most anti-Semitic chatbot.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Would you buy Sony's perfunctory PlayStation Portal if it finally had a screen that looked as good as a Steam Deck OLED? That's in addition to rumors spread by fellow leaker Zuby_Tech on X, which promised the screen could hit a max of 120Hz refresh rate, up from 60Hz on the current Portal. We still don't have a good idea what this would mean for the device's battery life. However, with new updates coming to PlayStation consoles, we may have the chance to see more games hit the fabled 120 fps benchmark when running at that lower resolution. The PlayStation Portal offers only an ounce of what players really want from a handheld, and yet it's reportedly sold relatively well, at least compared to its 2023 launch. Last week, Circana's leading video game industry analyst, Mat Piscatella, posted on Bluesky that the Portal has a 7% attachment rate for U.S. PS5 owners from launch to date. The PS5 has sold 84.1 million units worldwide as of September last year, according to Sony. While we don't have official numbers on U.S.-specific sales numbers, Circana's estimates suggest Sony has managed to sell several million units of a device that's good for remotely playing a PS5 over Wi-Fi and, more recently, for streaming some games with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. The Portal recently received an update that enhanced its UI and made it easier to access these streaming titles. The supposed Switch 2-like dockable PlayStation 6 handheld has already been detailed in multiple leaks by reliable AMD rumormonger Moore's Law is Dead on YouTube. This upcoming device may use AMD's yet-to-be-released RDNA 5 graphics. KeplerL2 clarified some additional details to Moore's Law's reporting, including that it would use LPDDR5X-9600 memory and run at a standard 15W of TDP (thermal design power). Based on the specs, it could prove to be a powerful handheld for playing current-gen and next-gen titles. Some modern games (mostly Unreal Engine 5 titles) struggle to meet the low watermark of 60 fps performance. At the same time, Sony may soon offer a new round of upscaling updates, called PSSR 2 (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution), that could boost the performance of games on PlayStation 5 Pro. Industry analyst David Gibson at MST Financial reported the ongoing RAM shortage has likely delayed any release of a true PlayStation 6 console. Considering the spiking cost of current-generation consoles, maybe that's not such a bad thing. In the meantime, during this cold, cold winter, we may need to huddle for warmth with our PlayStation Portals and imagine what they could be. I know you're desperately wondering about the floppy drives in this Maingear Retro98 desktop. The latest RTX 50-series is hundreds or thousands of dollars more expensive than at launch. The new Core Ultra Series 3 chips and XeSS 3 AI upscaler can juice up frame rates on laptops, but handhelds may benefit the most. The retro Game Boy maker's first pro-level controller may still be enticing even to non-hypochondriacs.</p>

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Glass wafer materials are emerging as a potential and viable alternative to their more conventional, aged organic counterparts. Replacing plastic-based cores with glass panels, these substrates offer lower warpage and a flatter overall profile, two properties that chipmakers will be keen to take advantage of as packaging becomes more of a performance limiter alongside silicon and memory. Samsung, AMD, Intel, Broadcom, and even AWS have all been associated with glass-substrate evaluation as they contend with the challenges posed by growing package sizes and wiring density. Now, according to Korean supply chain reporting cited by DigiTimes, several Chinese companies from across PCBs, displays, and outsourced semiconductor assembly are understood to be moving into the glass substrate market as the technology is increasingly seen as “a new growth engine.” Visionix alone is understood to have now begun “full-scale investment” after spending the second half of 2025 organizing a supply chain for materials and equipment. Meanwhile, BOE has already launched a glass substrate business following internal technical verification. On the manufacturing side, AKM has built a pilot production line, while assembly and test giant Yuntian — which gained notoriety after entering Huawei's supply chain — is also known to be assembling its own glass substrate capability. It should come as no surprise that capital scale and execution speed are being emphasized here. It's a matter of significant national importance to the Chinese, with Xi Jinping recently calling AI “epoch-making” and defining it as a core pillar of the country's next five-year plan through 2030. Glass substrates introduce entirely new defect modes and reliability challenges, and early missteps can be very expensive because these defects tend to appear later in the manufacturing process. Glass is, of course, brittle, so microscopic cracks from mishandling or drilling can survive early inspection and then propagate during thermal cycling or mechanical stress. It's entirely possible — and arguably likely — that customers evaluating early glass-core packages will require extensive thermal cycling and long-term aging data before they can commit to volume production, potentially extending timelines beyond the 2027 to 2030 projections given by manufacturers currently working with the technology. Chinese companies seem to be willing to absorb these challenges and the potential associated costs in exchange for a long-term competitive advantage in advanced packaging. Outside China, companies in South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and the U.S. are also exploring glass substrates. Meanwhile, Samsung Electro-Mechanics signed a memorandum of understanding with Sumitomo Chemical back in November to establish a joint venture for glass cores, while LG Innotek has delayed its glass substrate commercialization until 2030 due to demand uncertainty. Naturally, companies linked to TSMC and major substrate suppliers like Unimicron are also exploring glass substrate options as part of their broader advanced packaging roadmaps, while Japan's Dai Nippon Printing has been developing glass-core technology within its advanced packaging business. The company announced work on glass core substrates using high-density TGV aimed at next-gen semiconductor packages back in 2023, announcing the launch of a TGV glass core substrate pilot line at its Kuki Plant last December. While all these companies are currently racing towards first qualification rather than full volume production, once a supplier manages to iron out defects and is qualified for flagship chip packaging, multi-year supply agreements will follow.

First and foremost, it is necessary to note that what Intel Foundry is showcasing is not a working AI accelerator, but rather an 'AI chip test vehicle' that shows how future AI and HPC processors can be physically built (or rather assembled). To a large degree, the company is demonstrating its entire construction method that combines large compute tiles, stacks of high-bandwidth memory, ultra-fast chip-to-chip links, and a new class of power delivery into one manufacturable package. In short, the concept shows that next-generation heavy-duty AI processors are multi-chiplet designs, and Intel Foundry can build them. At the heart of this platform are four large logic tiles allegedly built on Intel 18A process technology (hence featuring RibbonFET gate-all-around transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery) that are flanked by HBM4-class memory stacks and I/O tiles and presumably stitched together with EMIB-T 2.5D bridges embedded directly in the package substrate. Intel uses EMIB-T, which adds through-silicon vias inside the bridges so that power and signals can pass vertically as well as laterally, to maximize interconnection density and power delivery. Logically, the platform is designed for UCIe die-to-die interfaces running at 32 GT/s and beyond, which are also seemingly used to attach presumably C-HBM4E stacks. The test vehicle also previews Intel's move toward vertical integration. The company's roadmap includes Intel 18A-PT process technology developed specifically for chiplets that stack other logic dies or memory on top and therefore must feature backside power delivery, pass-through TSVs, and hybrid bonding. In the case of the 'AI chip test vehicle', 18A-PT base dies sit under 18A/18A-P compute dies and either act as large caches or perform some additional work. Together with EMIB bridges, these methods enable Intel to build a hybrid lateral-and-vertical assembly that Intel positions as an alternative to large silicon interposers with higher wafer utilization and yield. For multi-chiplet AI and HPC accelerators, power delivery is the principal design constraint. To that end, Intel's platform should be able to combine all of Intel's latest power-related innovations, including PowerVia, on-die Omni MIM capacitors, bridge-level decoupling in EMIB-T, base-die eDTC and eMIM-T capacitors, and embedded CoaxMIL inductors to support 'semi' integrated voltage regulators (IVR) that are located beneath every stack and below the package itself (as opposed to IVRs in the case of TSMC's CoWoS-L, which are a part of the interposer). This layered network is designed to support fast current swings of generative AI workloads without collapsing voltage margins and deliver maximum clean power when needed. Showing an 'AI chip test vehicle' is a way for Intel to attract customers. Yet, it remains to be seen whether the company's codenamed Jaguar Shores AI accelerator, due in 2027, will use the architecture that Intel is showcasing today.

Tim Cook said that Apple has a low supply of memory chips following the increased demand for the latest iPhones. Cook said in his response to a question about the memory shortage's impact on the company during its 1Q26 earnings call that Apple does not keep these chips in stock, and that it's currently scrambling to find sources because of the iPhone's strong sales in December. It exceeded our expectations, to say the least, and you know, iPhone grow 23%,” Cook said. And based off that, we're in a supply chase mode to meet the very high levels of customer demand.” He also added later, “We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly. As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that.” While the best RAM kits with 32GB of capacity now exceed $400, you can still get a decent 16GB kit for less than $250 — this is by no means an affordable price, but it's still way less than what Apple charges you just to get the privilege of more memory. Nevertheless, it is still one of the remaining few companies that have not increased pricing because of the memory chip shortage, possibly as a result of the prices being so high to begin with. Mini PC maker Minisforum was one of the first to announce a price hike, and it was soon followed by Dell, Asus, and even Framework desktops — because of this, industry experts predict PC prices to jump by 8% in 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's one example: In 2017, when President Trump issued a series of executive orders instituting a travel ban on foreigners from certain countries (predominantly Muslim-majority ones), people from across the United States vigorously protested the policy. They included some of tech's most elite: Google cofounder Sergey Brin, who joined a demonstration at the San Francisco airport; Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who wrote a company-wide email outlining “legal options” that Amazon was considering to fight the ban; and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who took to Instagram to describe his own family's immigrant roots. On Saturday, hours after federal agents shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in the streets of Minneapolis, several prominent tech executives attended a private White House screening of Melania, a documentary being released by (of course) Amazon MGM Studios. The timing was not lost on the group of Silicon Valley workers who recently launched ICEout.tech, essentially an open letter to their bosses. The letter, posted following Renee Nicole Good's killing earlier this month, has now been signed by more than 1,000 tech employees. Those workers, who come from across the spectrum of Big Tech companies and startups, are asking that executives use their clout to demand Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents leave American cities, that they cancel company contracts with the agency, and that they speak publicly about ICE's violent and deadly tactics. Today, though, a movement like ICEout.tech feels downright revolutionary: Tech employees have been notably quiet this past year, as the power dynamic within their companies tilted to favor management versus frontline workers. This week, Silicon Valley leaders including Anthropic heads Dario and Daniela Amodei, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Apple CEO Tim Cook finally spoke out about ICE's outrageous overreach. It's a start, but I wanted to know more about what was happening inside tech circles, and where the industry goes from here. So I asked two early ICEout.tech signatories, Moonshine AI CEO Pete Warden and Gatheround cofounder Lisa Conn, to sit down for an emergency episode of The Big Interview. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Pete and Lisa, thank you so much for joining me. I'm thrilled that you're able to be here. PETE WARDEN: It's great to be here. LISA CONN: Thank you for having us. You're among the many who've signed the ICEout.tech letter that has now been widely circulated in Silicon Valley. That movement and the website actually launched earlier this month after the tragic shooting of Renee Nicole Good. What made you decide to put your name on this letter? At this moment in the tech industry, it is no small thing to put your name out there on a document like this. Conn: I signed the letter for a bunch of reasons. I think one of the primary ones is that it feels like we are entering an economic and governance crisis when the government starts killing people on the streets and then denying or reframing what is clearly documented. Just purely thinking about the economics of it, in those circumstances, capital starts to flee. Talent leaves, and it will take decades to recover from a situation like this. So I suppose it is risky within the tech community and when thinking about potential retaliation from the Trump administration, but the stakes are too high not to act and not to speak up. Warden: Much like Lisa, there were a lot of reasons behind this for me, but a big one was seeing how much courage the people of Minneapolis were showing. I spent five years at Apple, seven years at Google, and a lot of my colleagues are too afraid to speak up. I'm a startup founder, so there may be retaliation if I can't raise funding for my startup, because people like Marc Andreessen do hold a lot of sway in the industry, but I'm not gonna get fired. A lot of my former colleagues are rightfully afraid that they will get fired if they speak up. How would you characterize the way that tech leadership has shown up? Conn: I think there's been a pretty significant power shift away from the employees in the tech industry and in most industries. Until about 2021, retaining employees was a top business priority. Talent was considered the most precious resource, and companies couldn't hire fast enough. Perks were abundant, and layoffs hadn't really happened. So employees had a lot of power. A lot did performatively, maybe some authentically. But it was clear that employees had a lot of power. As the economy started to shift and companies started to do layoffs in 2021, 2022, employees lost a lot of that power because retaining them wasn't as important. Coinbase was a real leader in this way. Coinbase was one of the first big companies to do layoffs, and Brian Armstrong was one of the first CEOs to say there should be no talk about politics in the workplace. So there was this correction that happened in 2021, 2022, where companies were much less willing to listen, because listening to their employees just didn't matter as much. It would save the company in severance. I imagine this is gonna shift back. These things always do, but we are still in a moment where employee power is not as high as it was a decade ago, and certainly five years ago. Warden: If I can add to that, I think another aspect is there's a lot more willingness from the administration to go after people in industry who step out of line. You are gonna have the power of the federal government used against you in a vindictive way. So in some ways, I actually sympathize with the CEOs, because this is not a choice that anybody ever expected to have to make between free speech and having your company destroyed. At the same time, I think this is an open question—and Lisa, you alluded to this a minute ago. Conn: I am generally an optimist, and I generally think that people are good, and when people aren't good it's because of their circumstances, not any kind of innate evil. My sense of the psychology of a lot of tech CEOs, especially those who are also founders—and this is speaking as a founder myself—is at some point the company becomes their ideology. I think when the culture and the power dynamics are such that being on one side of an issue is more favorable, it's easier to speak up. And when there could be harm to the thing that feels like life-or-death for you as a founder, it's a lot harder just to speak up and to be critical. It's hard for me to truly believe that in a decade people's ideals and values—people, meaning tech CEOs—have completely changed. Everything I know about how people change their minds and what persuades people suggests that doesn't really happen. So I don't think it's that this moment is somehow giving them permission to be their true selves, but rather that it is more beneficial to companies in 2026 to be quiet. I think that's what's unique about this moment and so important about this moment is, maybe that was true two weeks ago, but I actually don't think that's necessarily true anymore. Conn: A key distinction between 2016 and now that we didn't speak about is how much more brutal the Trump administration is, how much greater Trump's corruption is, and so much more blatant. The very foundation of the tech industry, scientific research, has been cut and is underfunded, economic stability is at risk, our ability to attract global talent—all these things are hurting, and that is going to hurt these companies in turn. Still, if this continues, I think we could reach CEOs of the top 10 tech companies and ask them to speak up because their companies are at risk. Warden: I can't know what's in people's hearts, but there's been this dynamic—we used to lionize tech startup founders; they would be held in universally high esteem. Everybody thought what they were doing was cool. And the tech industry won, we became a dominant industry, and that came with a whole different dynamic around being held accountable, people not liking everything you're doing. I really feel like that shift from being given a lot of leeway because you were the scrappy underdog to owning massive parts of the economy means that you are gonna get a lot more criticism. I have to believe that that was shocking to a lot of people, a lot of the top-end tech CEOs, who'd been used to very friendly treatment by the media and the public. Suddenly they were being treated like the CEO of Exxon or something, and that had to be a shock. Conn: I think it's hard for people to change their self-perception away from being the underdog. So if you see yourself as punching up, but the world sees you as punching down, it's challenging to change that. Lisa, you mentioned a minute ago that what has happened in Minneapolis in the last few weeks has tipped the scales. I'm curious to hear from both of you what the conversation among your colleagues has been like over these past few weeks. We're seeing that people in a big range of roles—engineers, CEOs, directors, VPs, people at the big tech companies, people at the AI labs, startup founders, VCs—have been troubled about this administration from the beginning, but these violent attacks on our neighbors and desire to suppress dissent is a breaking point. We've seen in the last 18, 19 days since this pledge has circulated, exponential growth and interest from all these companies across the political spectrum and across a variety of roles. Warden: Even people who do not follow politics, and I can totally understand why people do not want to deal with everything that's been going on for the last few years, just people couldn't ignore that and people really responded to that by saying, look, this is wrong. Like this is obviously wrong, and I think that that has been the big difference I've seen in conversations with people across the political spectrum. When WIRED first reported on this open letter a couple weeks ago, you had a few hundred signatures. But the tech industry is a huge business. Amazon alone employs over a million people in the United States. I have to ask, why do you think this list isn't in the tens or hundreds of thousands of names by now? By speaking out, you are marking yourself as somebody that the Trump administration will demand be fired, or the tech company will suffer harm to its business. We think of startups as these crazy renegades, who sort of march to the beat of our own drummer, but the reality of the venture capital industry is if somebody like Marc Andreessen is saying he will not do business with people who are against the Trump administration—which really feels like a lot of what's coming from some of the top people in the VC industry, even VCs who are sympathetic—they're gonna have to do deals with Andreessen Horowitz in the future. So just having a few key influential people in the venture capital industry means that even startups who are all supposed to be about “think different” and all of these other slogans we've been throwing around for years, glorifying ourselves, there's actually a very centralized system that makes it very costly to go against the handful of big figures who are at the top of this industry. Have either of you spoken with anyone directly who didn't want to sign on, who decided not to? Warden: I definitely have multiple people at Google that I've spoken to who are absolute believers in this, but they are too afraid to put their names behind this. Conn: People I've spoken to are putting their ethics above any fears that they have. But those same people might be more comfortable posting internally in Slack or having a conversation internally in Slack. For instance, there was reporting that there was a Slack channel within Palantir where folks were expressing concerns about this. If employees of companies get inspired reading about this or seeing it, but maybe feel that handling things internally is more effective, that's fabulous. I wanted to ask you about Palantir, actually. Some companies' work is tied to ICE, and reliant on government contracts. How do you respond to that idea? Warden: If you look at Palantir, it's not like they're gonna go bust if they turn down the ICE contracts. I think what a lot of people aren't realizing on the business side is that Trump is not gonna be in power forever, and people are looking at what these companies are doing. For the long term, people are not going to forget that Palantir was a key enabler of ICE. That has benefits for them right now with this administration, but down the line, they have publicly allied themselves as keen supporters of this horrific brutality. Do you both feel, from your own experience, does that kind of internal pressure work? Conn: Kim Scott, a former Google employee and amazing author, wrote about this effect for The New York Times last year where she talked about how CEOs are rarely the first to break with perceived political consensus, and that only when they feel pressure from a range of folks in their organizations, from their peers, from their friends and family, and from their employees, will they seriously consider shifting their positions. We've seen Sam Altman make a statement internally in response to pressure from employees. We've seen Dario and Daniela from Anthropic, and a number of other leaders have made statements in response to this. What I think is interesting is we may not know what's working because it is totally fair game for CEOs, who maybe are in tuxedos at movie screenings at the White House, to be having private conversations that are never reported. That may be more effective than making public statements; that may be more effective than speaking up at an all-hands meeting and making declarative statements. Trump was in Washington over the weekend and he was with a lot of these people this weekend. It does seem as of [Wednesday] that things are changing in Minnesota. So we may not know exactly what's going on, but there's no question that being a thorn in the side of a lot of these leaders, they notice that there's a thorn in their side, and they wanna pull it out one way or another. Warden: Just to add to that, one of the first places that pressure shows up is in recruiting. Even though general tech employees are now treated as essentially disposable, and they've lost a lot of their bargaining power and leverage, in the field of AI, there's still very fierce competition for talent. So that's the most immediate place where once candidates start turning down offers at these companies, and the feedback is that they don't want to work for somebody who's causing this much harm, that is very quick to go up the chain in my experience. You mentioned that several of these executives were at the Melania screening at the White House over the weekend, but you're right that prior to that, and then subsequently this week, Tim Cook issued a public statement. This is about trying to make practical change happen. Anybody who's helping with that, we are super happy to be working alongside them. Who are we still waiting to hear from? Whose voice in this have we not heard, who might really move the needle? I don't know if we're getting anything, but who knows what's being said behind closed doors. Warden: As a startup founder, I'm hoping to see more from the venture capital industry. Like I said, the dynamics of that industry make it very hard to break from the pack. Even though everyone likes to think of themselves as contrarian, the costs of doing that in the VC industry can be very high. You know, Vinod Khosla, who was an investor in my first startup, it's been great to see him being very vocal about comments by [Khosla Ventures partner] Keith Rabois that were pretty ghoulish. So I want to give Vinod props. He's one of the giants of the industry, so having him come out and say that, I was so thankful to see that. I'm really hoping we get to see more leaders like him coming out and doing the right thing. I wanted to ask you both, before we wrap up, about the nature of being a startup founder. Pete, you've mentioned it a few times. A lot of startup founders, as you've said, have chosen to stay quiet when it comes to politics. They don't want to put their business at risk. Warden: I just say, do what you can. A lot of younger entrepreneurs don't have that privilege, and what I would say is just please try and find other ways to help. Try and get involved with your local community. You know, in San Francisco we are still having the Tesla Takedown protests a year after it started. I sometimes show up there in a Portland frog costume to dance around. Warden: If you feel like, “I didn't have any way of using my voice in tech to protest what was happening, but hey, I could turn up on a street corner and dance around like a goofball,” it will make you feel better. It helps the world, but you will also not feel powerless, which is what I hear from a lot of startup founders right now. And that's where it doesn't have to be public, it doesn't have to be a big statement. Just join the community that's formed around this. One, I don't think being opposed to state-sanctioned violence and being lied to by our government leaders is very controversial. So if this is the moment where you feel compelled to speak up and you're a little afraid, I think the risk is low, personally. The second thing I will say to startup founders is: Focus on building a great company. If you build a great company, people will want to invest. Investors are capitalists, they're not ideologues, most of them. If you are ideologically in opposition to one that is an ideologue, they might not be a good fit for you anyway. So focus on building a great company. If you build something great, if you do something interesting, investors want to be part of it. They won't necessarily care that you oppose state-sanctioned violence. You don't need to be extreme about anything. I don't think it's effective most of the time. I think investors will still be thrilled to write you a check. Warden: If I can just jump in on that as well, if you can get to cash-flow positive, then the dynamic changes. That's part of why I'm willing to stick my neck out. Yeah, exactly what you're saying, Lisa, just build the company and you do get a lot of ability to really get your voice out there once you've done that. The list has over a thousand signatories. Are you guys collectively planning anything else? I have every confidence that you will. Warden: And these are verified signatures, so I think there are more being verified, but each one of these is verified and we confirm it's a real person. From my side, and this is still an idea that's just bubbling around my head, not an official idea from ICEout.tech, but I would love to have an in-person meetup in San Francisco. Let people just see and hear that there are all of these other people who share the same beliefs, who believe this is wrong. We've seen in Minneapolis the power of people coming together. Let's not murder people in the street.” And Pete, if you go ahead with that meetup, please give WIRED a heads-up.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Typically using psilocybin mushrooms or LSD, the archetypal microdoser sought less melting walls and open-eye kaleidoscopic visuals than boosts in mood and energy, like a gentle spring breeze blowing through the mind. Anecdotal reports pitched microdosing as a kind of psychedelic Swiss Army knife, providing everything from increased focus to a spiked libido and (perhaps most promisingly) lowered reported levels of depression. A new, wide-ranging study by an Australian biopharma company suggests that microdosing's benefits may indeed be drastically overstated—at least when it comes to addressing symptoms of clinical depression. A Phase 2B trial of 89 adult patients conducted by Melbourne-based MindBio Therapeutics, investigating the effects of microdosing LSD in the treatment of major depressive disorder, found that the psychedelic was actually outperformed by a placebo. Across an eight-week period, symptoms were gauged using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a widely recognized tool for the clinical evaluation of depression. But MindBio's CEO Justin Hanka recently released the top-line results on his LinkedIn, eager to show that his company was “in front of the curve in microdosing research.” He called it “the most vigorous placebo controlled trial ever performed in microdosing.” It found that patients dosed with a small amount of LSD (ranging from 4 to 20μg, or micrograms, well below the threshold of a mind-blowing hallucinogenic dose) showed observable upticks in feelings of well-being, but worse MADRS scores, compared to patients given a placebo in the form of a caffeine pill. (Because patients in psychedelic trials typically expect some kind of mind-altering effect, studies are often blinded using so-called “active placebos,” like caffeine or methylphenidate, which have their own observable psychoactive properties.) This means, essentially, that a medium-strength cup of coffee may prove more beneficial in treating major depressive disorder than a tiny dose of acid. Good news for habitual caffeine users, perhaps, but less so for researchers (and biopharma startups) counting on the efficacy of psychedelic microdosing. “It's probably a nail in the coffin of using microdosing to treat clinical depression,” Hanka says. “It probably improves the way depressed people feel—just not enough to be clinically significant or statistically meaningful.” They were led to believe there was no placebo group. “Placebo effects were stronger than what you would get from microdosing.” Olson goes on to say that placebo effects in psychedelic trials can be further juiced by the hype around the drugs themselves. In Olson's study, it wasn't a matter of microdosing effects not being real, but that those effects may be caused by environment, or patient expectation. As he puts it: “It can be true at the same time that microdosing can have positive effects on people, and that those effects are perhaps almost entirely placebo.” This itself raises a sticky question about MindBio's study. This means that patient expectation was lowered, as they could ascribe any perceived effects to either the LSD or either of the active placebos. Patients taking LSD microdoses may well have believed they were merely on a stimulant. All patients followed an adaptation of the “Fadiman protocol,” a popular microdosing programme that sees patients taking a small dose of the given drug once every three days. Jim Fadiman, the veteran psychedelic researcher after whom the protocol is named, rejects MindBio's conclusions, and trial design, out of hand. Because, Fadiman believes, patients were given the active caffeine placebo, their reported benefits may well be attributable not to a pure placebo effect, but to the actual psychoactive properties of that drug. Fadiman points to MindBio's earlier, Phase 2A study, recently published in the journal Neuropharmacology, which drew markedly different conclusions. It was a non-blinded, so-called “open label” study, meaning patients knew definitely that they were being microdosed with LSD. It also found improvements in stress, rumination, anxiety, and patient quality of life. Fadiman says that this reportage is more consistent with his own research on microdosing. “Their prior study did wonderfully with LSD,” Fadiman says. “I have collected literally hundreds of real world reports over the years that validate those findings.” “But that is the nature of good science—a properly controlled trial will get a proper result. Despite these findings, some microdosing true believers don't seem especially shaken. “In my book I took very seriously the possibility that what I was experiencing was the mother of all placebo effects,” Waldman says. Still, one cannot help but wonder why anyone looking to use LSD to aid severe clinical depression would bother assuming the legal risk of procuring and consuming a drug still classified under Schedule I by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Certainly, for his part, Justin Hanka seems content to pivot MindBio's research into a new field. His next project is “Booze A.I.”: a smartphone app that uses artificial intelligence to scan the human voice for relevant biomarkers that determine blood alcohol concentration. “I put millions of dollars into this myself,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GOG creating a Linux launcher and Steam Box with SteamOS coming out soon should benefit PC users in general not just gamers since Microslop sees Windows like a social experiment where they can test AI on unsuspecting lusers, as an ad platform and a store front now. Funnily I also run GoG games through steam proton.. But looking forward to the GoG client working! And now it doesn't even split games in "Linux" vs "Windows"; it simply assumes all games run on Linux. Valve has good, stable funding to pay a team full time to build and support Steam OS which, over a long period of time and with enough user uptake, I think will have better chances of getting publishers on board with ensuring their games work on something that isn't Windows. Hell, they could probably make deals with publishers to say "hey, here's a pile of money to make sure your game works on Steam OS day 1, and put it in all the ads" and get the ball rolling that way.Gaming is a tough space to crack. I think Valve's money and their history of supporting the most popular gaming platform on PC inspires more trust needed to make their platform a standard target.

The goal has to be to make native Linux attractive, so that they actually bother to create native executables, using Vulkan and co.Until then it is no different from playing arcade games with MAME on Linux. Until then it is no different from playing arcade games with MAME on Linux. There are many older games I can't install on Linux anymore, because they used an older SDL1 or some particular X11 version or some GPU driver that's no longer available for the current kernel.The exact same game, Windows version, can be installed and runs flawlessly on both Linux and Windows.So, native Vulkan executables? Sure, if they can continue to run in 20 years. The exact same game, Windows version, can be installed and runs flawlessly on both Linux and Windows.So, native Vulkan executables? Sure, if they can continue to run in 20 years. Sure, if they can continue to run in 20 years. For them DirectX and Win32 is what matters, if folks go out of their way to run on Proton, that is Valve's problem. Literally half the gaming/hardware focused channels I watch have run at least one, if not several Linux Gaming videos and tests this past year... mostly in the past 4 months and mostly praising the state of Linux gaming. And studios definitely check out their games running on Steam Decks via Proton now, so that's good. I rather do believe that many game developers would actually love to give a more native approach for writing GNU/Linux games a try (to make this point more plausible: game developers are very used to game-console-native SDKs).But what these game developers really demand is a very stable user-space API for everything that is necessary for writing games, which will work reliably on basically every GNU/Linux distribution, and will be supported for at least 20 years. But what these game developers really demand is a very stable user-space API for everything that is necessary for writing games, which will work reliably on basically every GNU/Linux distribution, and will be supported for at least 20 years. Sure, the platform is enshittified spyware, but that only impacts the game devs on their work machines (which are probably locked down to protect secret IP anyway). Microsoft has basically lost control over their own platform at this point. That didn't hold the DOS ecosystem back.As for the ABI:The Linux kernel has started adding syscalls to enable native-like execution of Windows binaries, and game devs are testing with Linux at launch. In the worst case, these are only used by Wine. In the best case, some good ideas from the Windows kernel will be exposed to regular Linux user-land.I don't see how it really matters if the binaries are targeting libc, musl, or an opensource win32 / win64 layer. That one victory goes a long way towards winning the entire war.On top of that, Linux is starting to show better framerates than Windows in the same hardware. It's not 100% of the time, but it's enough that you should run the game in both places if you really care to get that extra few percent out of the hardware. If the rest of us can run something decent at home, that's a > 99% solution to the problem.Put another way, for a long time, you needed to buy an SGI workstation or whatever to make assets for PC games.

I think most gamers so far haven't cared about openness because pragmatically, it didn't matter for them.Now they're seeing the long-term effect of not caring about that though, which is why we're suddenly seeing a movement of gamers moving to Linux, and trying to get others to move with them, because they realize the importance now, as their desktops are slowly collapsing over Microsoft's decision to let AI do all the programming, and having zero QA before releasing stuff to the public.

Most people game on PC because certain games they like to play are only on PC, or are much better suited to PC, or because their friends are on PC, or because they want to play on the go (Steam Deck is very recent and still not widely used), or because they need to have a PC anyway. One aspect I think will be interesting is to compare what happens to attitudes with prices changes in more affluent markets like North America or Western Europe compare to how PC has been approached in other markets like Asia or South America. The initial cost upfront was higher than a console but if you want a lot of games it ends up being worth it. I buy a stock machine like AlienWare, overwrite Windows with Kubuntu and go to town gaming. The entire point of EEE is relying on usefulness and convenience combined with network effects to make the entire system restricted and control it.

So, they're not keeping up with inflation, at least around here. They are but AI has fried the markets for RAM, SSDs and GPUs. Personally, I think at least one or two of the major GPU OEMs will go bust thanks to all of this, and I would be surprised if Framework, Pine64 and Steam's hardware line survive it. Remember late 2020 when every useless GPU would command a fortune? A month later, it would cost at least twice as much, if you could even find one in stock. Last December I looked a bit at prices, and the current equivalent model (9060xt 16 GB) was roughly around 300 again, and I don't think it has gone up since. I understand there may be a shortage of equivalent Nvidia GPUs from a thread the other day, so this may change soon, again. Truly I have seen not even a hint of reason to believe prices would come back down in the near term. Everything I'm seeing points in the same direction: this is only going to keep getting worse for consumers month after month for a long time. One of the major x86 manufacturers makes CPUs with integrated graphics that is good enough for gaming. It's in "Steam's hardware line" btw.Oh yes, AAAs maybe won't run on that. Oh yes, AAAs maybe won't run on that. You would struggle to play any graphically intensive game, old or new, without at least a modest GPU.

I am already doing that with Heroic Games Launcher, which is far better than whatever they will concoct in-house and supports many other stores. So yes I want gog to be native linux on things like the deck. I don't really want to see locked down hardware in the space any more than there already has been (Nintendo, Sony, X-Box, etc)... I think the PC centered gaming community largely wants a more open platform in general. In the long run, I don't see a lot of solid competition... especially with ever growing legacy libraries of content. If people really want Linux to be a viable alternative to Windows, run by a majority of the general public, it has to be possible to sell closed-source software that runs on it (where "it" means a broad range of different distros).Yes, that means less freedom concerning that particular software. If Poettering is signing my kernel and reporting my UUID to websites along with proof I am viewing all ads, that is dreadful.Unfortunately it will be the latter. Motherboards already have signed binary firmware blobs, some people cannot remove the Microsoft keys and still have functioning UEFI secure boot. Motherboards already have signed binary firmware blobs, some people cannot remove the Microsoft keys and still have functioning UEFI secure boot. I hope they will plug into Proton and collaborate with Valve, but we really need official tools and brands on Linux for common users to feel comfortable enough to come over. The latter had been designed to be a full OS but didn't have a functional kernel when Linux was released, and Torvalds adopted the GNU userland for his project.See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd If they then go add additional features like wine integration to that tool to make it overlap more with Heroic is something we're all assuming, but not actually a given. If you use Linux like MacOS and only run static binaries and containerized programs via things like flatpak everything is fine.It's totally possible to treat the distro simply as a thin base layer and get everything else from flatpak and the various container hubs. It's totally possible to treat the distro simply as a thin base layer and get everything else from flatpak and the various container hubs. They're entirely welcome to do this, I just think there's room for more opportunity with combined/open effort. Sure.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that doing nothing remains an option. We're looking at the next Valve, I tell you! All it will take is the one hire for this listing, a penguin, Bellevue, and Codeweavers.Minus sarcasm: I understand their interests in this and how it might even be a net benefit for all. I won't say it will be free, Heroic users paying the toll. Oops, there I go being loose with words again. Minus sarcasm: I understand their interests in this and how it might even be a net benefit for all. I won't say it will be free, Heroic users paying the toll. Oops, there I go being loose with words again. Also, even if it was fragmentation I'd prefer competition to ensue. I don't want another Steam situation,  even if in theory a launcher isn't holding any valuable data hostage. Precisely because of what you say: I don't want another Steam. Precisely because of what you say: I don't want another Steam. I'm not really against GOG taking a swing. To be clear: I'm for a first party solution. It will have considerable impact on the users. Every time a for profit company uses open source they'll either create a closed fork, and if they can't they'll create closed source modules for it.I'm not saying it's bad to wish for companies to support FOSS, I'm just saying it's an unrealistic expectation to have. There's definitely a desire for an appliance/console like experience where all the complexity is hidden behind install/play buttons, and steam has got most of the way there. Personally pushing towards monoculture on an open platform needs to be tempered, and there's a lot of debate previously for other places where that's relevant. They insist, yes, and forever remain hopeful that This Might Be the Year. Supporting Heroic would appear on-brand given their old game/archival messaging, but I'm not learning marketing for free.Not really against a first-party option, even. I do, however, find the inevitable user split notable. I do, however, find the inevitable user split notable. Unless they've utterly botched their PAL and buried it under several mountains of technical debt, porting is probably going to be relatively straightforward.I'm not giving Linux gaming a second shot merely because of a bunch of ancedata about proton and wine improvements - I'm giving it a second shot because Steam themselves have staked enough of their brand and reputation on the experience, and put enough skin in the game with official linux support in their launcher. While I don't have enough of a GOG library for GOG's launcher to move the needle on that front for me personally, what it might do is get me looking at the GOG storefront again - in a way that some third party launcher simply wouldn't. I do have Satisfactory there, Heroic Launcher might be enough to avoid repurchasing it on Steam just for Linux, but it's not enough to make me want to stop avoiding Epic for future purchases on account of poor Linux support.

This is one of the areas where GOG Galaxy has tried to stand out. It supports integrations with other launchers in Python: https://github.com/gogcom/galaxy-integrations-python-apiIt's intended for the other direction of other launchers (or third party integrations with other launchers) feeding data to GOG Galaxy, but it's still one of the more interesting attempts in the wild of a launcher trying to be a little bit more than just a walled garden.I don't know if in an Official Linux port of Galaxy if they'll try to find more ways to integrate beyond what they've already done with their Python API and how much they would be willing work with other launchers, especially Heroic, but of the big game stores, GOG seems one of the few that actually wants to try. It's interesting seeing so many comments assume the worst of them, as someone who has played around with that Python API a little bit. Didn't get very far, but it was neat what seemed possible.)

And as the underdog it even makes sense for GOG to fully embrace cross-store launchers. I am happy that GoG will finally make its launcher available to Linux. I've been buying and playing games from GOG on Linux for a very long time with no need for GOG Galaxy -- which is a thing I know nothing about. Since this announcement, I've been trying to figure out why I'd need it.It seems like it's just a convenience application and social connection point (leaderboards, etc.). In which case, it's not something of interest to me. However, I've also seen references to Galaxy that imply that it's necessary to play games -- which is obviously untrue in general, but perhaps there are some games that require it?Anyway, I'm tremendously confused by all this.

I've never personally seen a game that required using it. You can still play GOG games without any launcher, which is how it's intended to work.Some people really like having a launcher to keep track of everything, so this isn't a nothing burger.

There's been quite a few deal breaking issues with Steam client and/or Proton that went unaddressed by Valve for months that just never happened to me on the GOG+game manager combo. (Remember the most recent Steam rewrite that made certain UI elements not work on Linux and which still needs a workaround option in the client years later?) All that on top of another application requiring full browser engine under the hood eating resources just to be able to launch a game. I don't know if I am just extremely unlucky to get hit with every Linux related issue on Steam and notice its drawbacks or if people are offering Valve unreasonably high leniency, because they see then as some sort of champion of gaming on Linux, while not giving enough to other players like GOG.Pardon my rant. I've always wondered were problems on Steam's side or on the side of game devs implementing its APIs?Anyway I personally experienced scaling issues, but chalked that up to my DE being unreliable. I also occasionally can't click on certain UI elements, but I recall this being a problem in Windows as well.

I don't need a client with your branding all over it, that has socials and my library and all engagement bait like that.I figure it's one step away from putting the DRM back on so you have to use the launcher to get a game from GOG.Just let me buy games and then shut up.

Game launchers are a good idea that lots of people want. So far, it's mainly Steam which has been able to do this on PC. I like GOG's launcher because 1) it's open source and 2) it can show other gamijg libraries thanks to fan maintained plugins. Those aspects give me a sense that the goal here (outside of to lower the friction into GOG's store) is indeed to serve the userAnd if that changes, it's easy to take my ball and go home. I've got tens of games through GoG and it's always my first port of call if I want a game. All I want you to do is sell me games. But we all know about enshittification and MBAs trying to round the wagons. All I want you to do is sell me games. But we all know about enshittification and MBAs trying to round the wagons. But we're in this hyper optimized world where kids are literally being auto scrolled through short form content. That's a larger societal issue that I can't do much about in times where my country needs to debate the merits of citizens being shot on the streets by federal agents. Maybe one day we can get back to a point where proper educational and parental supprt resources is,  say, a top 20 issue? I see no simpler explanation why someone would buy out a subsidiary like that.All in all, GoG thrives on people being sentimental and it's totally in character for the owner to be sentimental as well. All in all, GoG thrives on people being sentimental and it's totally in character for the owner to be sentimental as well. As for fusion360... Freecad is getting mighty good these days... * Integrations with online parts libraries don't seem to work (don't know why they didn't bother, as it looks like it just spawned a web browser anyway), and the simulation add-ons aren't available either, but the main program itself is equivalently functional. I basically don't leave the Steam UX. Valve has done such a great job here I don't see why any Linux user would consider buying games anywhere else. I don't even know how to install non steam applications on my current stepup. The SSD is really easy to replace, and my logic is the controllers have to go bad eventually.Edit: comes with a nice case and 2 USB c ports.Be realist with what games will work, frame gen only goes so far.I'd rather spend 80$ on new controllers vs 600$ on a new device.

I think GOG is saying a lot of the right things in terms of Game Preservation being a long term goal for them. I think they are between a rock and a hard place that the store would be a lot less active if they couldn't offer the latest games from companies like Sony, and they want to be on good terms with such companies to get access to their giant back catalogs for Preservation efforts which also presumably includes sales numbers of recent titles for justification.But yes, I'd also love to see them push back a bit harder on some of these publishers a bit further than "needs an offline-capable installer" and mabye include more steps towards some definition of "should run offline-capable", because yeah things like "Live Services" and account systems and mandatory telemetry systems and rootkit anti-cheat systems are often de facto DRM just wearing another hat of "user convenience" or "achievement tracking" or "game safety" tools. I don't think GOG can make that push alone, though. (Thinking about the recent Anthem shutdown as a recent for instance of a mostly single player game that is entirely unplayable because EA shutdown live services this month.)

They do this to push Galaxy for convenience I suppose as most are used to clients that handle updates but it can be confusing if some wonder why for instance their offline installer shortcut opened Galaxy instead. To be clear: if you buy Disco Elysium on GOG, download the "offline game installer" without using Galaxy, install it, and run the game on a desert island, it will work (the network requests fail open). But if you try to run the game after removing the bundled dylib/DLL, it will not.Why do Galaxy-free games ship with a mandatory dependency on Galaxy?

Because the developer linked the dynamic library in at compile time instead of writing additional code to load it at runtime and disabling/enabling features based on its presence.You can call it budget limitations, incompetence or lack of respect for the customer.

If I can send you the private key and the game and it allows you to run the game with no further inputs, then the DRM is trivially broken (even without open source).If it does some online check, then if the source is open we can easily make a version that bypasses the online check.If there is some check on the local PC (e.g. the key only works if some hardware ID is set correctly), we can easily find out what it checks, capture that information, package it, and make a new version of the launcher that uses this packaged data instead of the real machine data.If you use a private key to go online and retrieve more data, having it be open source makes it trivial to capture that data, package it, and write a new version of the launcher that uses that packaged data.Basically, DRM requires that there is something that is not easy to copy, and it being open source makes it a lot easier to copy.

I do wander about the use of an open source launcher at this point though. Hopefully they will pursue a container/Flatpak native system but probably not! A good game, running at workable framerates, no more crashes than usual (it's a Bethesda game, after all), and the software was free as opposed to building out a new PC with Windows 11.It's like rediscovering PC gaming after years of it becoming bloated and a cash grab. Gamers used to own the games they purchased via cassettes, disks, and later even digital copies. Now through platforms like Epic and Steam you are provided a digital "license" to play the game.ALL of this speaks to the "openness" of gaming and it is ALL important to gamers.As previously stated though, game creators have been forced to choose the platforms they can create their games for. By the 90s the majority of personal computers were running MS-DOS and Steve Jobs had a base take on games being "toys" and did not belong on Macintosh products.Fast forward to the early Oughts and you see games like Angry Birds and Candy Crush making millions by producing games on ARM technology which really pushed the entire industry forward to focus multi-platform gaming outside of the tradition routes of either PC or console or both.Furthermore triple A studios led the charge and made big decisions that smaller studios would follow until around the release of Cyberpunk 2077.

This in my opinion was the big turning point that gamers decides to act against large studios from all of the decision making that has turned a relative open system to a closed system.The invention of the Proton protocol to allow gaming on Linux Machines is FORCING industry to ABIDE by the wishes of the customer. The gamers are FINALLY winning!This isn't just about openness on operating systems and being able to own the thing you purchase.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Are we to believe that Vitamin D supplements have an effect size 4.5X larger than antidepressant drugs, and nobody noticed this massive discrepancy until now?Effect size is also a favorite metric in this vein of supplement-over-pharma writing because it's so commonly misunderstood and it's so easy to find small supplement studies that have outlier effect sizes.To put it in context, even common OTC pain meds can have effect sizes lower than 0.4 depending on the study.

I know too many people who delayed trialing SSRIs for years due to internet driven fears and lost many years of their lives to depression based on content like this. Then they finally decided to try real antidepressant medications and wished they'd done it sooner.As much as I wish we could all just cure depression by taking a simple Vitamin D supplement that has 4.5X higher effect size than antidepressant drugs, this claim just isn't passable.

Hiking has the biggest effect though.I think maybe the problem is that therapists are diagnosing people, and psychiatrists are prescribing pills based on those diagnoses, but neither are ordering bloodwork to check for deficiencies. Which leads to a lot of people suffering from lack of basic health, and treating the symptoms with SSRIs that have withdrawl symptoms a million times worse than most of the problems they treat.Now to your point, I seriously doubt that vitamin D will hold up against anti-depressants and therapy if we control for other health and quality of life issues. I just think there is a ton of misdiagnosis, and lack of root cause analysis in the mental health field, and health care in general.

I remember reading that pine trees give off a chemical that is a natural human bronchodilator.One thought of why people love hiking, especially in piney woods, is that the chemical allows humans to process more oxygen which in turn helps them feel more "energized".I point this out for two reasons:1. It highlights that there are MANY confounding variables so it will always be tough to figure out the isolated impact.

That statement is broadly true for most outcomes studied, but specifically for depression the larger study results are pretty mixed.VITAL (the heavily cited metastudy) shows no effect. VITAL (the heavily cited metastudy) shows no effect. But there are other large metastudies like this one for Vit D (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39552387/) and this one for Omega 3 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31383846/) that do show robust moderate effects. Either way, the conclusion to this whole debate is incredibly simple: get a blood panel done and go from there - it might not even be one of these that ails you. What the article states, then fails to take into account, is that is the mean effect size, and there is huge variation.Anti-depressants are notorious for producing different effects for different people.What that high variance means in practice, is for any anti-depressant, the people who get good results are getting a much higher effect than 0.4.

(I don't mean this in an insulting way; the fact that placebo alone has a "large" effect is a big deal, still under-valued, and means something important for how mood/cognition can directly impact physical health!) > Although some review studies have presented suggestions of a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms (Anglin et al., 2013; Cheng, Huang, & Huang, 2020; Mikola et al., 2023; Shaffer et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2022), none of these reviews have examined the potential dose-dependent effects of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms to determine the optimum dose of intervention. Considering these uncertainties, we aimed to fill this gap by conducting a systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) to determine the optimum dose and shape of the effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression and anxiety symptoms in adults regardless of their health status.===> even common OTC pain meds can have effect sizes lower than 0.4 depending on the study.

No, the domain name is nature.com because it's in a Nature Publishing Group journal, Scientific Reports, which is their least prestigious journal.It's a common mistake, and they do that on purpose, of course, to leverage the Nature brand.It's also a mistake that implies a complete lack of familiarity with scientific publishing, unfortunately, which makes it a bit difficult to take your judgements regarding plausibility very seriously.

It's still peer reviewed, and as the sibling comment said, more applicable to this type of research. Also you now went from raising understandable objections to refusing the argument because it comes from a specific journal, which doesn't sound very scientific to me That's still the main issue, and it is something that people who don't understand scientific publishing struggle understanding/doing, because they lack the intuition for how certain results came about. Could there be something else affecting the accuracy of larger trials? Perhaps they are not as careful, or cutting corners somewhere? Small studies are more likely to give anomalous results by chance. It would be a lot different if I sampled 1,000 people.2. Studies that show any positive result tend to get published, and ones that don't tend to get binned.Put those together, and you see a lot of tiny studies with small positive results. When you do a proper study, the effect goes away. Exactly as you would expect.The less charitable effect is "they made it up".

I understand that studies try to their best to use a diverse population, but I often question how successful many studies are at this endeavor. If a minority of patients benefit hugely and most get no benefit, then you get a modest effect size.This is probably why this discussion always has a lot of people saying “yeah, it didn't help me at all” and a few saying “it changed my life.”I believe we should be focusing on more relevant statistical methods for assessing this hypothesis formally. Basically, using mean differences is GIGO if you assume you're comparing a bimodal or highly skewed distribution to a bell curve.

For the past 15-20 years, november thru february are basically a writeoff due for me due to seasonal affective disorder. Cold showers, exercise, no alcohol, strict sleeping rituals. Vitamin d. I can still sleep 11 hours and feel like reheated cat shit.Enter citalopram. I'm more emotionally available, no longer tired, less cranky. I could cry with joy because I could finally understand emotionally why people like the Christmas season.I won the SSRI lottery I guess, the side effect are sweaty feet, vivid dreams and a dry mouth.

Luckily, sertraline was an almost instant cure.I can come off it for periods, but it tends to reoccur after a while. It turns my life into one worth living.The reason we can't take sleeping pills daily is because they stop working in fairly short order.

At least that's how it was a while ago. Orexin antagonists don't cause dependency and provide high-quality ("natural") sleep. But you'll find it right next to the normal <=5mg doses without any explanation. Psychology intervenes in the chemistry, like many other activities do. The goal of that is to solve the root cause so that your future levels will be maintained at the right level, instead of just forcing the level by sourcing the respective chemicals externally.A good rule of thumb in biology and particular any kind of hormone production and balance is "use it or lose it" - if you start regularly receiving something externally, internal production will scale back and atrophy in response, in many cases permanently.

We don't really know how SSRIs work, but there's some evidence that it's through desensitizing serotonin receptors, not directly addressing the lack of serotonin. If so, "use it or lose it" doesn't apply; long-term adaptation is the point, and SOMETIMES does persist after quitting. There are ways to "hack it".For example, ~6 months ago I started trt (testosterone replacement). It was the best decision health wise ever. I feel way better psychologically, first time in my life I managed to stick with cardio training for so long (before 3 months was the most). There are other benefits too.So what about the "loose it" part? For example, ~6 months ago I started trt (testosterone replacement). It was the best decision health wise ever.

Interesting.Well, I don't think you'll be able to avoid testicle atrophy even if it minimizes it, but the important part is understanding the tradeoff. Particularly, that adding testosterone will cause changes throughout your entire body (including, for example, shortening life expectancy a bit), and that adding other hormones to the mix will likewise cause changes around the entire body and not just one single process or organ.But it's your body, your life, your priorities and decision. I also wouldn't consider it a good decision health-wise to take steroids to get huge, but I have no problem with someone deciding that absurd bulk is their main goal in life and worth the tradeoff.

"lose it then use it" would be a general rule for type 2 diabetics where insulin resistance commonly due to weight gain is the primary problem. Losing the weight leads to better uptake and usage. For a type 1 "lose it then use it" you typically lose the ability to produce insulin to an an autoimmune disorder, then are stuck using insulin for the rest of your life.The body itself typically attempts to main homeostasis, but at population scales this is something that is going to have a massive range of ways it shows up. Evolution, at grand scales, doesn't care if you survive as long as enough of your population survives and breeds. At the end of the day you might just be one of those people that was born broken and to work properly you need replacement parts/chemicals.

In case of insulin resistance, your natural production is running full blast with demand exceeding supply because the consumer stopped caring about the hormone. In case of autoimmune disease, the natural production was killed - you can neither use nor lose what is already dead, and even if some capacity was left it will either soon be killed or atrophy under external insulin, but it will not be mourned.So no I would say it is exactly the same - "use it or lose it" - but that does not mean that there is never a reason to manually overrule your body's attempt at homeostasis through direct manipulation. It just means that there is a very significant consequence to the process.> The body itself typically attempts to main homeostasis, but at population scales this is something that is going to have a massive range of ways it shows up.As a somewhat sidenote, this is also why I dislike the idea of trying to classify people into "normal" and "divergent/atypical". In my eyes we're all normal people and an entirely normal aspect of being a human is that we all differ and have individually specific needs by virtue of being built by a trillion micro-meter sized workers, each with their own hand-copied version of the blueprint, only caring about the millimeter of you in their immediate vincinity and not really talking to any of the others.

A depressed person would tell that most people around him are wrong and are optimistic only because they don't understand how bad all is. I'm incredibly optimistic and am content with my position in life. My default state is being mindful of the present and I don't think about things too far into the future. I very rarely ever feel stressed out over things in life.However, none of that changes the fact that I feel completely empty and find no joy in things. Interests are nearly non-existent, emotions dialed to 1, and the only thing I'm motivated to do is lay in bed staring at the ceiling... unless I'm on sertraline.Admittedly that's just anecdotal, but I worked in a clinical neuroscience lab researching treatments for severe treatment-resistant depression (read: people who tried so many options including CBT that they even tried electroshock therapy).

You wrote three words naming a thing which doesn't seem to exist. Where did you say it was anything more detailed than that? What behaviour that people "can't control alone" are you talking about?) For emphasis: I do not think it is simply/exclusively “chemical imbalance.” No, anxiety and depression aren't simply a matter of perspective. It's not at all clear that chemistry is the root issue. The brain is a synaptic graph that does something. Some graphs can have weird paths that lead to pathologies (maybe bad feedback loops). Chemistry seems like fairly a blunt instrument for bludgeoning a "bad" graph into one that's "better".Forced habits, like cognitive exercises from psychology, can sometimes rewire the graph by themselves because that's how the brain learns/adapts, but we still don't have a good grasp on how to do this truly effectively in many cases.That said, the blunt instrument of chemistry can sometimes be useful, particularly if it enhances neuroplasticity, as I think psychedelic research is beginning to show.

There probably are many genes which affect how much fat bodies store, or burn, or food cravings, or what constitutes hunger, or production of various leptins and grehlins and insulins and stomach acids, but that doesn't mean "I'm obese because of my genetics" is any kind of explanation at all. Downe's Syndrome is a good use for genetics as an explanation. Having a gene from birth doesn't mean it's being expressed and is therefore causing a specific problem, or that the problem can't go away and can't be fixed.

You know that leg "chemistry" is control by neurotransmitter release, yes? So you must have never heard of Familial Periodic Paralysis then. Familial Periodic Paralysis is also called Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and is due to mutations in the gene that encodes the alpha-subunit of the skeletal muscle sodium channel (SCN4A).https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1338/"The paralytic attacks are characterized by decreased muscle tone (flaccidity) more marked proximally than distally with normal to decreased deep tendon reflexes.

Doctors of all countries have been under a lot of pressure by patients and health administrators to "fix the issue and quick".

Prevention is one of those things that when we actually attempt to fix it would have to completely change the world you live in.Humans are social creatures and a huge part of our mental health is dependant on the society around us.

Not that my personal experience is actually a statistically significant sample, but I don't know anybody who takes sleeping pills. Or maybe I do, but they haven't told me. I've also never heard heavy sleeping pill use is one of the stereotypes about Americans. I have multiple family members who take Ambien (zolpidem) before bed every night. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db462.htmSeems like daily users would be less than 10%. Seems like daily users would be less than 10%. something weird is going on there, for sure. Cutting yourself off social media, or stopping watching the news isn't easy. Being bombarded with advertising telling you that you suck is not something you can personally deal with.The US especially has this idea that we're all rugged individualists and any problem we have is our own and not one created by the larger society around us and therefor communal solutions are bad, and you should toughen up. Some drugs may be over prescribed, I have no idea if Ambien is one of them, but trying to fit 340 million people across 50 states into the same box isn't going to be very accurate. This has been true across two countries (Scotland, Hong Kong) and multiple doctors, with a third country's (China) doctor suggesting I try out sleeping tablets for a few weeks - and only giving me a very limited supply of them - to try out instead.I wonder if the "here take these" is a predominantly American phenomenon due to the weird incentives around health care costs (I'm being genuine here - maybe it's predominant in other countries too, I honestly don't know!)

Even this article is trying to claim that Vitamin D has 4.5X higher effect size than antidepressants (e.g. that they don't work)> It's like if we took sleeping pills every time we had trouble sleeping. Having said that, I just realised I have the impression that's exactly what people do in the USA?USA is actually not the world leader in over medication in this domain, even though it's popular and safe to hate on Americans.

Similarly, SSRIs have much better evidence in treatments for many other situations, like anxiety, and yet the medicine itself is attacked, not using it to poorly treat a disorder we barely even begin to understand.The "hate" is not based in science, despite the fact that SSRIs are objectively a mediocre treatment for depression.We just don't really have much in terms of better treatments because we know so damn little about depression.The medical community knows SSRIs are mediocre and have a low success rate at treating depression. Everything is a bad treatment for depression because "depression" is a loose collection of symptoms and statistics that we have really poor understanding of, and will certainly be broken up into the actual diseases that make it up when we figure them out, and we will be able to medicate those diseases more effectively.Every single doctor that would prescribe you an SSRI for your depression will also prescribe vitamin D supplementation if your blood shows low levels.Someday we will also have a situation where we are going to have to admit that for some subset of the population, their depression has no cause other than "Your life is utterly terrible, for reasons entirely outside of your control, and nothing I can do as a medical professional can fix that".

It's why lots of other cultures look at us and what we do with relative confusion.

It's why lots of other cultures look at us and what we do with relative confusion. I can't speak for USA but in parts of Europe a lot of people have PTSD that prevents normal sleep, so they end up on these pills, and then they end up with PTSD and worse insomnia caused by long term use of sleep meds.I think it's just incentives. Sexual abuse for example is pretty rampant in the US. Sexual education at a young age so people know they are being abused under no uncertain terms is a good solution for this.And yet you will run into far too many people that under no uncertain terms want their children to be excused from sex abuse education. What deeply concerns me is when you see people with this position that you know where sexually abused themselves.I don't know, people really suck.

I wish people would stop saying this.Our understanding of the brain is not sufficiently sophisticated to allow us to identify the "root cause" (whatever that means) of depression in most people. Indeed we have no reason to believe that there even is a root cause to most people's depression.If you take antidepressants, go to therapy (or meditate or exercise or whatever), then go off them and still feel good, that's great.And if you take antidepressants indefinitely because doing so improves your life, that's also great! They're advising you based on their clinical judgement and experience, but ultimately it's your decision to take the pills or not.

And after a formal diagnosis, I am 100% certain they are all in my head because that's where my brain is. What I'm feeling can influence my physical symptoms and rather abruptly at that. None of this means that disease is imaginary or not real or I can talk myself out of it. There are some very good treatments, but I will never ever be cured (barring a miraculous breakthrough).While the causes of mood or personality disorders are less well understood, it seems entirely plausible that they can be just a physically inevitable. Every thought, feeling, sensory input and motor output is a physical process originating in your brain and your brain can malfunction if it's ill. And we can treat illness with medicine.

I know this road leads to SSRIs at the very least, so I always reply in the negative.The parent comment hints to me that this might be a mistake. I do not want to become accustomed to an antidepressant, so perhaps my course of action was correct.I was measured low on Vitamin D, which I've hopefully corrected, and I haven't always eaten fish regularly. Perhaps I should pay more attention to that. The parent comment hints to me that this might be a mistake.

Not giving your doctor full medical context seems like a mistake - for example, maybe depression would be indicative of another issue, or maybe people who are depressed really shouldn't take a specific medication.To each their own, and perhaps you have other reasons, but this seems like a less than ideal solution to a very trivial problem if the goal is just to not take an SSRI.

She then proceeded to say "well I'll just write you the prescription anyway and you can do your research later and decide to fill it or not".I was actually shocked by this interaction, and think about it often. I answered one question with a "yes, but it's manageable and I think I can handle it with lifestyle change" and then said no twice to medication and ended up with a prescription, which I ignored but don't appreciate having on my record, since it's a false indicator for future prescribing physicians.

Getting treatment for "depression" doesn't always mean SSRIs etc. Sometimes it means treating the underlying condition(s) that are having downstream affects. I would suggest everyone gets their Testosterone levels checked among other common things. I am doing several blood analysis with a functional doctor and lyme may be around or was in the body, and so many other things. I did get my Vit D up to 65 and I seems to be issues with ADH hormone since kid and probably that makes dehydration. This is actually a somewhat difficult diagnosis to make, especially when diagnosing adult ADHD without the user documenting and bringing in a well defined log of their behavior (and possibly another person to point out things they don't know about themselves).>ADHD is a highly heterogeneous disorder with a significant comorbidity rate.Is thing that you read about in literature around it.

And it's logical - you simply get "triggered" less. is the same that a lot of people fail to understand: Then try a lower dosage!Unlike most anti-depressants, where you have to constantly increase the dose because your brain just generates more receptors to fight back, SSRIs hardly wear off.Also, relax about the "become accustomed" part.

Are you depressed on a regular basis, but can not name any valid logical reason?

A lot of people tend to assume that you are just lazy, or not trying hard enough, as if it was just a matter of willpower.Kind of frustrating, because those same people would never walk up to someone in a wheelchair and say "have you just tried walking?" but for some reason mental illnesses get a free pass to be ableist.

In before "of course things are easier when you're taking stimulants! ", which is another dumb thing I hear too often. I can just concentrate on boring things afterward. Calvinism.There's been a number of papers written about how pervasive Calvinistic ideas are in the medical community.

You should examine that.We all live in a cultural bubble but any time you find yourself thinking that millions of people somewhere else do something crazy, you should probably talk to someone from there.Sleeping meds might be prescribed at a higher rate in the US, that wouldn't surprise me due to the specific incentives in our health care system.

But that's a far cry from your impression. I don't know how rampant that problem actually is, but I don't think you should discount the impact of social stigma when it comes to mental health. Historically it has been a source of massive shame with people expressing embarrassment at their loved ones suffering from mental health crises. And now we have a whole generation of influencers and politicians  who are trying to tell people to pour out all their medications, reject doctors wholesale, take their specific brand of colloidal silver, and be free.I just think this is a lot more complicated than “psychiatrists abuse the diagnosis.” I just think this is a lot more complicated than “psychiatrists abuse the diagnosis.” And when you question this approach, the famous lecture comes: "but diabetes patients take insulin for life. You realize depression is a real condition and need to be treated right?" Well that but also they have poorly understood long term effects even after being discontinued (in some people, not others) and they don't work for everyone. I don't recall the source but a given antidepressant only works for something like 1/3 or less of the population. So take a person not in a great place emotionally, who is also statistically not in a great place in life overall, subject them to an insufferable bureaucratic process, give them a drug that doesn't end up working for them, add in some pretty wild side effects, sprinkle on a few long term effects that persist after they discontinue the thing that didn't work to begin with, and of course you end up with a bad reputation.The tl;dr is that our understanding of the brain and mood disorders kind of sucks. Ideally, a doctor will recommend diet changes in addition to the pills. However, relying on lifestyle interventions almost never is effective, And the more we learn about it, the more we realize that cholesterol is mostly genetic based rather than diet based anyway. So the most effective thing they can do is say "here, take these indefinitely". And thank God they do because it saves thousands of lives annually.For many people with depression, a neurochemical imbalance is the root cause. Just like with statins, addressing it means taking some pills. For many people with depression, a neurochemical imbalance is the root cause. Just like with statins, addressing it means taking some pills. meanwhile people are like "just take magnesium or melatonin lol" Everyone should check with their doctor, but it's an inexpensive supplement and the effects (if any) show up pretty quickly, so IMO it's worth a shot. Are you saying that >50% of people with depression that are "helped" by antidepressant, would have been helped _to a similar extend_ with a placebo? Are you saying that >50% of people with depression that are "helped" by antidepressant, would have been helped _to a similar extend_ with a placebo? Inarguably, well-proven false for others.Likewise, placebos and aspirin are comparable at relieving those headaches where aspirin doesn't really solve the source, but that doesn't mean aspirin's well-documented effects are meaningless in general. Any drug will come with negative side effects for some portion of its users. Multiply that by the high number of people who have ever taken an SSRI and it starts to become obvious why there are so many Internet anecdotes about SSRIs not working.Meanwhile, most people who take SSRIs successfully aren't going around and advertising the fact that they're on psychiatric medications. There is less stigma now than there was in the past, but it's still not something most people like to broadcast to the world. For patients on long term SSRIs in stable states, the SSRI is just a routine thing they take in the background and don't really think about. There's no reason for it to come up in conversation.

I have started taking SSRI after a harder-than-usual body collapse, and after no matter what I did my mood hasn't improved for a month. Regular running, meditating, writing, crafting, coding etc were my antidote to my mood swings but this time it didn't work. Started taking SSRI and continue doing all this things, and I was reborn.My therapist said that a big chunk of why i am feeling better is also because I kept doing things that are good for me. That she sees with a lot of her patients that they think a pill will magically change the situation. It doesn't work on itself, you need to show up and do things that release serotonin in your body.But seriously, unbelievable, years of frustration and friction in my life disappeared and I have never felt better.

As it turned out, I was suffering pretty severe anxiety. The way life was.The thing is, all of my assessments remarked that I demonstrated relatively high self awareness and openness. My experience being diagnosed with ADHD and depression made me seriously concerned for people who 1) can't afford this process and support, and 2) will just continue to grind like I was, living half-dead without knowing it can be any other way.I suspect there are a ton of these people—I think I notice them quite often—and I was arguably accidentally pulled from that stupor and would likely still be there, unaware, if it weren't for a chance encounter that caused me to think slightly differently about the possibility of having ADHD.

I had a very similar experience, except it killed my libido, so I chose to endure the suffering of Winter rather than live with emotional numbness.Still, I strongly recommend it for people flirting with the abyss. Still, I strongly recommend it for people flirting with the abyss. I got on Sertraline because I was depressed, and it actually brought my libido back, by virtue of just bringing me back to a better emotional baseline.All to say, if it had affected my libido, it'd have been a NOOP anyway in my case. Wouldn't a "NOOP" be the opposite of a "Nope"?Sorry for the pedantry, but this forum seems an appropriate place for this. please people, take my post for what it is: anecdotal evidence. SSRIs can basically give you any possible side effect, including destroying your libido. When I hear people say "it killed my libido" I always think about the fact that hyper-sexuality can be a trauma response, and if your body is healing the hyper-sexuality is most likely also reduced.It's like when you have a disease and then read the side effects of a medication and notice that a lot of the side effects are basically also something that can happen when your overall condition is improving but still some people report them as adverse effects and then these are added as side effects to the package label.For example you take antibiotics but bacteria can have toxins in their body, and when the bacteria disintegrate you get more sick from the released toxins. It's called the Herxheimer effect: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarisch%E2%80%93Herxheimer_rea...When I started methyl-B12 supplementation I also had inflammation in sinuses for weeks but it was just from my immune system starting up again and being able to attack long-standing inflammation.

Is this your trauma speaking, or do you automatically associate any sexual needs with a pathology?You've done it twice in this thread alone. You've done it twice in this thread alone. The situation is PersonA has determined they need an anti-depressant. It stands to reason that they may be using sex as a painkilling mechanism. But I understand that it would have been better to ask and not associate because it's a fraction of the cases. Either OP is confused about what libido means, or has some kind of heavy shame around sexuality. )Also, I wasn't expecting my article to do well on Hacker News; thank you everyone for the comments & critiques! > The "standardised effect size" of antidepressants on depression, vs placebo, is around 0.4. )Also, I wasn't expecting my article to do well on Hacker News; thank you everyone for the comments & critiques! Also, I wasn't expecting my article to do well on Hacker News; thank you everyone for the comments & critiques! Don't take it as criticism, more of a personal take on figuring out what antidepressants do for me. Furthermore, since posting that parent comment I've converted my vit. Maybe you were right all along and all i DID need was a heroic dose of vitamin D. (... thats what she said) About a week ago, there was a reddit post claiming it's actually geographically impossible for anyone where I live to produce enough Vitamin D naturally from the sun alone, due to the shorter days and lower angles throughout the day. I can't find a rigorous academic source right now, but the top web results all say we need at least UV Index 3 for our skin to be able to make enough Vitamin D. I guess summer may work for us, in the Montreal/New England area, but other than that, yeah, you and I will need to get Vitamin D from diet and/or supplements. I had an old gf receive two different drugs each with terrible side effects. To me it looked as poison.I decided that I would rather hurt myself myself than fuck with my brain chemistry this way.During the dark northern Winters I lack vitamin D (your doctor can measure this using a blood test). The symptoms are some physical issues and probably something that can be described as light depression which goes away if I remember to take the vitamins.We are all different.

People often forget how important all this is. People often forget how important all this is. I finally went and got diagnosed at age 46 for what had been an childhood-onset issue in retrospect. All the signs were there: inability to start work until enough challenge or novelty or a state of crisis had come about, etc. When I spoke to friends about considering treatment, they said they thought of me as a hyperfocus kind of person. But they didn't see how many support systems I had put in place to function normally, how I saw others around me just doing things while I had to work myself up to start and then keep checking and double-checking for the silly inattentive mistakes I knew from experience I would keep making.I've had a meditation practice for a long time and it has helped with anxiety but it hasn't really helped with getting started on tasks, especially those perceived as boring. I even had to psych myself up to sit down and start meditating, even though I knew I would enjoy it.I didn't know until a year or two ago that non-stimulant medication existed to treat ADHD. I always thought it was only Adderall and the like, and I couldn't risk anything that would ramp my anxiety up, or take additional treatment for the anxiety with SSRIs because I have severe hemophilia and any additional risk of bleeding from SSRIs was an untenable proposition.After sitting on the idea for some time and just hoping that I could fix it with more meditation, I finally decided to see a psychiatrist. The doctor suggested Atomoxetine, but said it doesn't work for most people and even then takes 3-4 weeks to take full effect. I started on the absurdly low dose of 10mg/day for the first month to be sure it wouldn't cause additional bleeds. By day 3 I could see a huge improvement in my working memory and ability to perform tasks. It gave me insomnia for a bit but I would wake up at 3 AM, sit down happily to work and write the best code I've written in years. I could not believe the difference it made. There were quite a few side effects initially but I was willing to put up with them because of how smoothly my brain was functioning. I became a nicer person to deal with. My only regret is not having done this sooner.So yeah, please don't avoid medication based on internet reading.

Two days later at work I felt very relaxed driving in and sat at my desk BUT something was wrong, my head was dead quiet (the GP explained this exactly like I would.) Just a calm quiet confidence to get the job done. Best day of my life.After that I called a mental health center and connected with an ADHD specialist who has been working with me. I am also on Atomoxetine myself and while it has not brought me back to that zen head space it brings me close enough. Overall my life has been slowly improving and I feel more confident at work.> So yeah, please don't avoid medication based on internet reading.This - 100% After that I called a mental health center and connected with an ADHD specialist who has been working with me.

So I ended up spending $300 on LED bulbs, both corn bulbs and 200W equivalent, bought some 7-Way splitters for my ceiling fan so it's holding 28 light bulbs (people have joked I have a “biblically accurate ceiling fan” because it's so bizarre looking, like a weird glowing biblical angel), and get about 10,000 lux in my home office now. As a bonus, I don't have to run a space heater in my home office (since I only need it in winter, I'd have been using that electricity anyway via a space heater). I had a friend on SSRIs not tell us they were on them when they hit a DMT vape pen at a party years ago and they got serotonin syndrome. I'm sure they have their problems too on occasion, but for me the decision to start taking Escitalopram was one of the best things I've ever done.The side effects were totally negligible compared to the benefits.I've stopped taking it a year ago or so and... it's basically cured me.I'm not saying antidepressant are a literal pharmaceutical cure for depression, but in my case it simply put me in a position mentally to change habits and patterns of thinking in a sustainable way.My only regret is not doing this 10 years earlier; the poor reputation contributed to that.

Plus, most of the more serious side effects take a lot more time to manifest than the typical length any given patient remained in the older clinical trials that secured FDA approval and grounded the official manufacturer literature.I am glad we have these tools, but I suspect they are vastly overused, and patients not well informed. I feel like doing those three things would make me feel like reheated cat shit, regardless of the weather outside. I often stay up till 6am (the parties I mentioned above only start at midnight)So yah it might make some people better but for me the times I break it are the ones that are exceptionally good. So yah it might make some people better but for me the times I break it are the ones that are exceptionally good. Took a while longer to get the dose right so that my anxiety also mostly disappeared, but the difference in quality of life it made for me is hard to put into words. (Roughly equivalent to Lexapro 15mg/day; Saffron 30 mg/day if Crocin+Safranal properly standardized) I'm a small, generally sensitive guy so ymmv... One meta-analysis showed an antidepressant effect size around 1.2-1.6 , and unlike pharmaceutical antidepressants, saffron with standardized crocin has no well-documented or commonly reported withdrawal syndrome in clinical studies or reviews. But I'm also saying there are no magic pills...! Perhaps your case was simpler, but people can feel chronic depression. They may take some drugs to modify that, but what if the external factors won't change? You can see this issue for some people who have a disease that only gets progressively worse. To cherry-pick a quote from a review of SSRI studies:>the magnitude of symptom reduction was about 40% with antidepressants and about 30% with placebo.That tells me that antidepressants have some effectiveness, but placebos work shockingly well. You can give someone a sugar pill with no medical properties whatsoever, and a good portion of people will recover, likely crediting the pill for their recovery. >the magnitude of symptom reduction was about 40% with antidepressants and about 30% with placebo.That tells me that antidepressants have some effectiveness, but placebos work shockingly well.

My point is that a lot of the commenters here are saying some variation of "have you tried being happier?" Both of which are absurd to the point of offensiveness to people who have gone through it, in the same way that it would be absurd (and offensive) to claim that these drugs have no possible downsides and a negative reaction is placebo. A particular point he makes about depression in it is insightful: Although depression is conventionally viewed as a medical illness, research studies indicate that genetic influences appear to account for only about 16% of depression. For many individuals, life influences appear to be the most important causes. I'm not saying it's the same thing as depression or regular anxiety, but it gave me tremendous perspective on how bad these conditions can be and you just don't have the ability to  "shake it off" when things are unbalanced.Maybe that's how my wife feels when she's off the meds.

I'm not disputing that someone had the genuine experience of antidepressants saving their life. I'm asking if that precludes antidepressants acting as a placebo.In other words both things can be true: antidepressants saved someone's life and antidepressants can act as placebo (even in the case where they saved someone's life). I'm not saying they are true, cause I have no idea.This is a logic question, not some kind of moral attack.

Without daily reminder of getting enough sun (or sun-like) light at the 6 o'clock⁰, your body clock will drift.It can start by feeling groggy instead of refreshed in the morning, even if you've slept enough. And can escalate into loosing the will to do anything or even live.No wonder. If you try to make your body sleep during the day, and eat and work during what body expects to be night, you won't really sleep and won't really live/work. Most of us do it, by exposing ourselves to strong (strong enough it won't matter if it includes blue wavelength or not).But you can do it consciously (and in a way good for you) by putting on light therapy glasses (I'm using Lumiere 3¹, and they are not the only ones, find your own) at 6⁰ everyday, or right after you wake up if you're trying to readjust your rhythm. Or if you have time and want to save $200, use a stationary lamp and just sit in front of it doing nothing. When readjusting, small doses of melatonin (0.5mg) 1h before sleep will accelerate body clock shift.But don't listen to me, if you have SAD, you should really listen to that ADHD experts episode.I feel for you, struggling with that stuff for a long time.

We even put Vitamin D in milk by default just so that people would get some extra. For some people even in sunny areas, 5000 IU might be needed to get you in-range. spoken like someone who has never lived in the UK In many countries it is physically impossible to get enough vitamin D from the sun, even if you go out naked.Also did you ever notice that the cheap apartments in many places are facing north and do not have a balcony, and of course do not have a private garden?

For D3, it is 25mcg / 1000 IU / 125%After splitting in half it's 12.5 mcg / 500 IU / 62.5%.I take with some fat-containing food to allow ir to absorb which is usually breakfast (yogurt, some nuts, some kind of fruit, oats), and it's a night and day difference in my mood (how easily I can control my temper if already agitated, how easily I brush off annoying stuff, takes the intensity off of my reactions and mood during conversations).I did a blood test before starting, and if normal is between 30 - 70, I was at 10. Dr prescribed megadose of D2, followed by daily D3, but I skipped on the megadose and went straight to D3 -- makes me wonder if a megadose would build up my stores since D is fat-soluble and make it so I could miss a day and not notice.All of the above is anecdotal from me, a self-professed cave dweller, but it's been a couple of years now, and I still notice the difference. Also, what I heard from people in Boston is that 90% of them are on a vitamin D supplement.

Edit: for clarity I am not saying it is impossible to overdose on oral tablets, but rather that with most tablets 400 IU to 1000 IU and the safe limit so much higher than these, it seems like it would be extremely unlikely for someone to be taking 30+ tablets daily. First: the RDA and the safety limit are not the same, and an RDA in a country being too low does not mean that the maximum safe dose is wrong.And it certainly does not mean that there is a higher risk in under-dosing than overdosing when taking the RDA (which already includes recommendations for supplementing if you spend most of your time indoors).I'm not a scientist, so I only know what physicians told me and what's explained in news publications or by consumer advocacy non-profits.Here are a study (which I didn't read) and the NHS's advise on Vitamin D toxicity:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557876/https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-...The study says:> Most cases of vitamin D toxicity resolve without serious complications or sequelae. However, in some instances, severe hypercalcemia can lead to acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Cases of permanent renal damage due to vitamin D toxicity are rare.Which sounds good, but I don't think it supports that there is no risk of oral Vitamin D overdose.

Regarding Vitamin D, I am also supplementing in the Winter, but I have not read the article, which says it has an estimated reading time > 10min. I'll bookmark this discussion page to read TFA later maybe. Also important to take it with Vitamin K. Seems like it would be best to increase time spent outdoors though. My starting levels were unknown but I assumed they were low given my usual sun exposure and some low-energy symptoms (which resolved a couple of weeks after I started taking it). It's my understanding that northern Europeans evolved fair skin in order to cope with the lack of vitamin D in their diet. I wonder if even the simplest LLM would make this particular mistake.

I think the downvotes are harsh btw and in general HNers have gotten too reflexively downvoting IMHO. Can you give the replyee some pointers, for example? Link to articles or studies that show a different view? But also here is something to think about: your body will produce more D3 than that by being in the sun for just several minutes. So if you consider such a low dose of D3 an overdose then you better steer clear of the sun! This is another superficial statement, that displays shallow-at-best understanding. You cannot just make wild assumptions about one of those pathways from stuff you know about the other pathway.And actually: Yes, you shouldn't stay in the sun for too long without proper protection. Having the sun shine on your skin is not some inherently healthy thing. It too comes with acceptable dosage and overdose. Symptoms of overdose are commonly known as getting a sunburn. And actually: Yes, you shouldn't stay in the sun for too long without proper protection. Having the sun shine on your skin is not some inherently healthy thing. It too comes with acceptable dosage and overdose. Symptoms of overdose are commonly known as getting a sunburn. The problem with that is, that you still need to know how to interpret any results and statements within the supposedly scientific papers. If you are not an expert in the matter of the paper, you might not realize some side condition, that makes some statement or result of the paper irrelevant for your individual situation. Just a simple look at the side effects of high dosages:Safety and side effectsTaken in typical doses, vitamin D is thought to be mainly safe.But taking too much vitamin D in the form of supplements can be harmful and even deadly. Taking more than 4,000 IU a day of vitamin D might cause:    Upset stomach and vomiting. Not being able to think clearly or quickly.

This is in line with Billington et al 2020, a 3-year-long double-blinded randomized controlled trial, where they found "the safety profile of vitamin D supplementation is similar for doses of 400, 4000, and 10,000 IU/day." IMHO, that's a small cost for reducing the risk of major depression & suicide. )So why then does Mayoclinic, etc, all say 4000 IU is the limit? I think because policy is decades behind science (this happened with trans fats), and also policymakers are much more risk-averse. (this is why in California, thanks to Prop 65, up until ~2018, there used to be a warning in every coffeehouse that coffee causes cancer. )But thanks to your comment, I will edit the intro to note what the official max safe dose is, and that more recent peer-reviewed research shows it's too low!

For example, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20398766/ this one lands on 1/4 of a MED = 1000 IU. Of course now we have a MED definition problem, but we're roughly talking single digit numbers for a white person in midday sun in NYC to reach 1/4 of a MED.2) If you also supplement with Magnesium, a lot of your side effects go away. 2) If you also supplement with Magnesium, a lot of your side effects go away. Regularly have my Vit D levels checked and they are always within the upper bounds of healthy reference range I did have one issue related to magnesium however. If I did a very high dose of magnesium taurate and a couple of other chelated forms I would have trouble catching my breath after physical exertion similar to chronic high doses of iodine.

Chia seeds taste ok but you need to prep them by soaking which is a pain (or experience bloating).All other seeds have more omega 6 than omega 3. Then you symptoms are good and healthy and a signal to make changes in your circumstances.You might actually have a good life but still feel depressed because there is a chemical imbalance in your brain. That is when drugs come in.It might be just a seasonal thing and you need to go outside more and take some supplements.You might have some other undiagnosed issue.

On a sidenote, I know that knowing that it is "just your depression talking" is also a pretty hard pill to swallow and not always helpful. Personally I have a lot of fears that I know are irrational but that doesn't make them any less real.And even if your problems are external, sometimes you need to focus and your inner self first, find some strength and help so you can tackle the external problems later. But for other people "working on yourself" can be avoiding the actual problems they need to work on.And yes happiness is always relative.

We tell ourselves that we must have "better lives" than say a native american in the year 1000AD, but there's no reason to think that.I think odds are that maybe the native american was happier -- having a small group that you spend time with outdoors every day, getting extensive exercise, having a clear sense of purpose, eating healthy fresh food every day, never once thinking about politics or bills or global warming. I bet they liked their life more than a depressed divorced accountant in our modern society, even if we have more material wealth or health access.

The problem with this that to a bad situation different people react differently - some trying to do what they can to improve the situation or at least don't make it worse and some give up and let situation to slip and become worse and worse (becoming a self fulfilling prophesy). It's not a choose one makes I think (it's likely a biological predisposition) but the difference is still exists.People prone to depression genuinely believe the main (only) reason for a depression that the life sucks and as a result they avoid medical help and don't do anything which could help them.

And each of those things can be caused by physiological issues as well. Many "between the ears" type problems are actually physiological.Root causing your issues enables you to deal with them properly instead of fighting the symptoms.Anyway, I take vitamin D and a few other things. Getting yourself checked out regularly once you hit middle age is a good idea. I have the usual cardio vascular challenges that many people struggle with because of a combination of genetics, age, and life style. And indeed a vitamin D deficit.I was also recommended to consume more omega-3 as well. Dirt cheap and it doesn't mess with flavor/texture too much. I keep a jar of ground flax seeds in my fridge. Takes 2 minutes to top it up every 1-2 weeks or so with some freshly ground seeds.But I'm also aware that me being a stressed startup founder has health consequences that a few pills and suplements won't fix for me. Sometimes the best thing I can do for my company is having a proper weekend or going to bed early enough that I can get my 8 hours of sleep. You can survive on 4 hours (been there done that), for a while. But most people are not at their peak performance if they do that.

For example: if your life objectively sucks, why aren't you doing anything about it? Some people whose lives suck fix their lives, and other people get depressed and do nothing; what's the difference? And: all of us know somebody who appears to have a good life and therefore their depression is presumably a chemical imbalance thing but if you're being honest the vibes in their life are a bit off, actually, like you can tell they're not really getting everything they need out of it, that they're clearly good at masking (for example people who are clearly not thriving in their relationships) .... in which case sure medication could help but you can't shake the feeling that facing the reality of their life would help a lot more.However! "Believing" in the chemical imbalance theory is part of why it's medically helpful. If your life has sucked for years and you could find no way of fixing it and then SSRIs helped, then you basically need to believe that it really was a chemical imbalance, because believing that it might not be threatens to take away the thing that's making your life work. So much so that I would bet at this point there are already readers of this comment who are ready to angrily reply to my preceding paragraphs, because the model I just described threatens their existence. Maybe they want to feel responsible for their life being bad, so they will be motivated to do something about it, and being happy due to drugs would make them feel complacent and okay with years passing by at a shitty job or something. Or picture someone whose parent has gone their whole life unable to take them seriously as an adult, which as a result means the child and parent have a bad relationship, and then picture the parent complaining about depression and taking medication for it. This can be really infuriating: the child thinks about the parent, "your life sucks because of the tension created by not treating people around you with respect, and you're so incapable of recognizing this even when it's told to your face regularly that you're taking drugs to feel better despite not fixing the problem". Now ascribing depression to medical problems seems like avoidance, and having people write off your frustrations and say that you're just depressed and need to take a drug for it is frustrating.Just saying: the two narratives really get tangled up. A lot of the issue is avoided if you just think of the drugs as helpful but don't choose any model (with its moral implications) for what exactly it is they're helping with. Just treat them as a tool for making you feel better.Also, I suspect that people who have an intuitive aversion to mental health drugs are probably way overindexing on that intuition. Turns out whatever your issues you can sometimes just deal with them sooner than later if you accept that doctors might be onto something. (Actually I think the reason people get stuck avoiding medication for so long is precisely that they feel like they're not allowed to be skeptical of them... which makes them kinda plant their feet in the ground and refuse to be open to it.

I know first-hand that low energy-levels and lacking energy production mechanically lead to depression.Also, look at how people (children also) experience the world and their relationships and their stresses when they are tired (or even just hungry) compared to when they are fit...Fix those, and the depression might be gone.This is not bashing against anti-depressants, they play their role to.

The technical details are beyond my understanding but I've heard from a PhD in the field that Masterjohn's understanding of metabolism is second to none. Whether his protocols work or not is certainly a case by case matter (like any health protocol), but he always appears to substantiate it with well-cited lines of argument, and is willing to engage with interlocutors.As for spending years with changing protocols without getting anywhere besides spending lots of money, well that can be said for people with complex issues who go the institutionally approved route as well.

If you (or your close ones) don't suffer from depression, then I guess it's best to ignore it until scientific consensus has formed. That will for sure show up on wikipedia. As far as I can see as a layperson there is a lot of correlation with Vitamin D that breaks down in interventions and Vitamin D is recommended mostly for babies and elderly people. On the other hand I see Vitamin D pushed as a miracle drug not unlike Vitamin C used to some decades ago and regular reports of overdosing of supplements leading to organ failure.If you're suffering from depression, you should talk to your doctor. Doing this has had a massive positive effect for me, and combined with decent nutrition and daily exercise, has been wonderful. Nikola Tesla quit all caffeine/other stimulants for a reason. Going to argue here, this is wildly bad advice. My comment was predicated on the belief that we wildly underestimate the negative effects of caffeine, as well as its activities at lower doses. I tried doing this for almost a full year, and while the improved sleep and generally improved mood was fantastic, and even toward the end it was so much harder to get any focused work done. I'm not sure my overall focus over time is higher with caffeine, but it does allow me to nudge more of it into the useful part of my day. However I'm a fast metaboliser of caffeine, and it doesn't impact my sleep at all, so could be that there's a genetic component to one's experience here. I'd add that my ability to sleep naturally was negatively affected as side effect of medication. No caffeine, exercise, sleep lead to a significantly reduced anxiety and more. Im on week 3 of no coffee now, I will maybe give it a month or two more to make a judgement call if I want to continue with coffee or not.It is unfortunate as I really enjoy coffee, but it causes some issues for me with anxiety and stomach problems. It is unfortunate as I really enjoy coffee, but it causes some issues for me with anxiety and stomach problems. Cutting out caffeine can help with anxiety but not ADHD. It's the opposite for ADHD, stimulates help significantly. Also there's a growing trend of diagnosing every focus problem as ADHD when many patients might have focus problems secondary to another condition like anxiety. It's sadly all too common to find someone who believes they have ADHD due to TikTok self diagnosis or even a lazy doctor's diagnosis but their core problem is actually anxiety. For these people, stimulants of any kind can actually worsen focus even if then provide a short term perception of helping due to the energy boost. I'm quite sensitive to caffeine, yet I can drink green tea all day without noticing much effect, while even a light coffee or a caffeine pill is clearly noticeable. I can also drink tea before going to sleep without any problems. It comes down to the type of tea, how much is used, and how strong it's brewed.There is nothing special about tea that breaks the rules of caffeine. It comes down to the content of the leaves, quantity, and extraction into water.> while even a light coffee or a caffeine pill is clearly noticeableCaffeine pills generally have really high dosages, FYI.

Any therapy and other similar human interventions?After all those - is it / was it still the case that cutting caffeine drove the best outcome? Things like journaling / breathing / etc calm the nervous system while caffeine stimulates it. I would say caffeine is counterproductive to those practices. I briefly quit caffeine once but it as well before any realization of anxiety. Caffeine in some form is there - recently sometimes substituting coffee for a Celsius. What feels different to me (compared to you) is this: sometimes I'll drink 2 cups of coffee in the morning and be awake but useless. Caffeine in some form is there - recently sometimes substituting coffee for a Celsius. I'm usually able to reason or force my way through depression and the like, but have had a few deep bouts in my life. The medications have ranged from ineffective to building a tolerance quickly, to just plain worse than the symptoms being treated. Nothing like missing your highway exit multiple times back and forth because you get lost "in" the drive on medication, or having 140 browser tabs open and losing 5 hours of work time.Everyone is different. I am amazed at how much western society has so many hormonal issues that come down to the lack of quality or appropriate fatty acid intake and a lack of something as simple as more outdoor/sun time.

After an absurd amount of trial and error with every over-the-counter, trendy supplement over the last couple of decades (and lord only knows how much money), these are the only ones that seem to make a subjective difference on my quality of life and an objective difference in my bloodwork. IMHO it seems much more likely that modern lifestyles (excessive screen time, poor diet, lack of socialization, no connection to nature, no spirituality, etc) have more of an effect than serotonin levels. I didn't yet get a fully satisfying explanation for this either.There's this diagram, showing for example the full pathway of how linoleic acid catabolizes: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Linoleic_acid_beta_o...It shows dependencies of the process onto several very specific molecular machines we call enzymes. (main pathway, handling saturated fatty acids)   ° Acyl CoA dehydrogenase -- removes 2 hydrogens from carbons immediately after the carboxylic head, forming a π-bond (double-bond) between the α-β carbons; ° Enoyl CoA hydratase -- adds water as H-OH to that α-β carbons π-bond; ° 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase -- converts the added -OH hydroxyl group to =O keto group; ° β-ketothiolase -- grabs the two keto groups, and snips off 2 carbons from the chain, carrying them off in bound form as a molecule of acyl-CoA; These, when viewed as a set of combinators, seem perfectly sufficient to metabolize any fatty acid chain. But it apparently handles all that!Besides catalysis (combustion of the acids for energy), the two other paths for consumed fatty acids are excretion, and laying them into cell walls and membranes.

Within my peer group of people on the spectrum (which very often comes with a depression, which is logical) we've discussed Vitamin D studies for years. And neither those who tried it INSTEAD of an SSRI, nor those that took both (SSRI + D) could report any measurable difference.I have a theory on why is that: It is known that low levels of Vitamin D is one likely cause for depression - in Northern Europe, where during winter time people do not get enough sunlight, that correlates very clearly with the suffering of depression.But potentially it simply does not work the other way round: I moved to near the equator, and I therefore basically have sunlight shining out of my butt, but still am depressed. It makes sense that in this case Vitamin D makes no difference at all.In summary my theory would be: Vitamin D only has an effect on a depression that was caused by a lack of Vitamin D.

I remember a similar case with levelsio who was advocating people to take melatonin and discussing how much grams is good vs bad. When I said that people shouldn't take medical device from someone who was successful in building web apps, he blocked me. The main problem with ALA is that to have the good effects attributed to omega-3s, it must be converted by a limited supply of enzymes into EPA and DHA. The remaining 85%–90% gets burned up as energy or metabolized in other ways. That's still more than the 300 mg of EPA and DHA in many 1-gram fish oil capsules, but far less than what the 7 grams listed on the label might imply.https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-not-flaxseed...Also, beware of omega 6 fats. Seed oils (corn, soy, canola) used in commercial food products are incredibly omega 6 dominant in terms of polyunsaturated fat content. Omega 3 fats are precursors to generally anti-inflammatory signaling compounds, whereas omega 6 fats are precursors to pro-inflammatory signaling compounds. The bias in fat intake leads to more pro-inflammatory signaling in the body, and a lot of alt health types have alleged this is a major causative factor in the obesity epidemic.This is important for depression, because chronic brain inflammation as a cause of depression was one of the going hypotheses at least a decade ago when I last looked into all of this. Upping omega 3 intake is an intervention that can address chronic inflammation, which is potentially why it improves some cases of depression.Pretty much nobody in the west needs more omega 6s these days. I hear even farmed salmon eat primarily corn and soy based feeds these days, meaning their fat ratio is skewed much more heavily toward omega 6 than wild salmon and fish. Seed oils (corn, soy, canola) used in commercial food products are incredibly omega 6 dominant in terms of polyunsaturated fat content.

Hemp hearts have much more omega 6 than omega 3, so they're not very effective for improving the ratio.Second, hemp hearts contain ALA, while what you generally want to improve is EPA and DHA (this is also covered in TFA). The body can convert ALA to EPA and DHA, but it's not efficient.So all in all, if Omega 3 for the article's stated benefits is what you want, this is not the way. I recommend looking into eating more fish, or if you want a vegan route, algae-based supplements. [0] is a decent source from the NIH about foods and their Omega 3 content, split by ALA/EPA/DHA.

Flax seeds are even better just for Omega 3 at 1:3, but hemp hearts have other benefits, like more protein, which is why I called them out. That said, I eat a fair amount of flax seeds as well. This is not to say that they're unhealthy of course.EDIT: see the sibling comment by code_biologist, it's much more comprehensive than what I've written.

That's not to suggest that exercise etc isn't great, just that society has come a long way in destigmatizing mental health and just being like "oh just take fish oil" to someone dealing with that kind of depression, either through shitty genes or childhood trauma or whatever, can be really harmful. It's processed into (7-DHC), the same compound in human skin.7-DHC is bombarded with UV light, triggering a chemical reaction that creates Vitamin D3. 7-DHC is bombarded with UV light, triggering a chemical reaction that creates Vitamin D3. (The STAR-D had a cumulative remission rate of 67%, I don't know how to convert that to the format he used)Otherwise I agree that vit D and omega 3 are underrated for depression, it would be interesting to see if they have a cumulative effect with antidepressants.

Unlike the commenter, I didn't suddenly turn into a chess grandmaster, but I did notice that my winter blues didn't show up this year, the first time in a decade! Edit: This may also be of interest: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomolecular_psychiatry There are studies that show this is an effective intervention. Getting Vitamin D from food is a fools errand, and since sunscreen and protective clothing slow vitamin D from the sun drastically, it's in most people's best interest to get it tested. Vitamin D is toxic (and ultimately fatal) at high doses, which is why the 'suggested' dosages of between 400IU and 1000IU are so conservative. I read this years ago and it's fascinating. Looks like it's been updated for a second edition last year. I did a blood test for vit D metabolites (oh 25 or something). It turned out I was deficient.The doc gave me 8k units as a prescription drug. After 2 months I was no longer defiecient (kinda borderline).

I may stop in the summer when I get more sun.I read somewhere that too much vitamin D has similar effects as too little (permanent hair loss, anemia, etc) but that may have just been on a blog similar to the linked blog on this submission.

Not to say they don't help, but it's asinine to state that nutrients are a replacement for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, whose sole purpose is to help with depression, and has been designed by an army of scientists, researchers, psychologists, psychiatrists. - I believe this crucial bit is missing from TLDR Please, insult your own analytical ability by doing the same here. The main instigator of depression is still societal as the postmodern era is pushing everyone into seclusion and addicting them to constant individualized dopamine hits, increasing the miserable effect on one's chronic mood and exacerbating one's self-consciousness about it. Some of the things which won't work also include pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, "not being weak", "toughing it out". Or fire.Just because fire will have a useful effect doesn't mean the knot is caused by an imbalance of fire and so you should keep burning your fingers for the rest of your life as "the cure" for knots. And (I argue) the way to untangle negative thoughts is not by powering through them, toughing them out, positive mental attitude, fortitude, being strong, manifestation, dreaming big, just getting over it, or crowbarring your mood up with sledgehammer drugs to an 80-billion neuron network for the rest of your life, or anything else of the millions of other concepts one could do or imagine doing - except the focused, pointed, feedback-loop skills of untangling negative thoughts wielded by a particularly good therapist or by yourself.Whether you develop such a thing by therapy training, meditation, prayer, Stoicism, biofeedback systems, luck, intuition... I suspect there are multiple ways which are effective that can be developed through multiple approaches, but not many. And "I tried thinking my bad thoughts away and it didn't work so it must be genetic" is not one of them. The things which will work are in a tiny space of things involving fingernails, needles, knot-eye-hand-feedback-loop and some understanding of rope and tangles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethos runs a three-sided platform where consumers buy policies online in 10 minutes without medical exams. Ethos itself isn't an insurer — it's a licensed agency earning commissions on sales. Though the company's stock closed its first day as a public company at $16.85, 11% below its IPO price of $19, Ethos co-founders Peter Colis and Lingke Wang still have plenty to celebrate, having grown the 10-year-old business to public-market scale. “When we launched [the business], there were like eight or nine other life insurtech startups that looked very similar to Ethos, with similar Series A funding,” Colis told TechCrunch. For instance, Policygenius, which raised over $250 million from investors, including KKR and Norwest Venture Partners, was acquired by PE-backed Zinnia in 2023. Ethos, which has raised over $400 million in venture capital, could have easily succumbed to a similar fate. “Not knowing what the ongoing funding climate would be, we got really serious about ensuring profitability,” Colis said. That financial discipline transformed it into a profitable company by mid-2023, according to its IPO documents. Since then, Ethos has also maintained a year-over-year revenue growth rate of more than 50%. When asked why Ethos went public, Colis said that a big part of the reason was to bring “additional trust and credibility” to potential partners and clients. He explained that because many major insurance carriers are over a century old, being publicly traded signals the company's staying power.
