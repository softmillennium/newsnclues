                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You should know that I am not the target audience for Paranormal Activity, a stage adaptation of the Paramount Pictures movie franchise running at Shakespeare Theatre Company through February 7. But more so, I am a sucker for spectacle, and this Paranormal Activity — which leans heavily on illusion and ambient creepiness instead of the “found-footage” format of its film iterations — is a horror hoot. Playwright Levi Holloway, whose Grey House haunted Broadway in 2023, has cooked up an original story that finds newlyweds Lou (Cher Álvarez) and James (Travis A. Knight) settling into a life in London, where they've been placed in stately corporate housing. They decamped from Chicago, where Lou's mental health had deteriorated from an unshakable sense of dread, but even with new digs and medication, spooks emerge with a seemingly strong hunger for blood. Lou tries to keep the spirits at bay — at one point enlisting a medium-turned-podcast-host Mrs. Cotgrave (Kate Fry), whose refrain is “Places aren't haunted, people are” — while James attempts the same with his devout mother Carolanne (Shannon Cochran), who insists on visiting the couple from her home in Florida. Initially skeptical, James doesn't take long to accept that something is amiss. As the spirits take hold of their home, the couple is left to salvage their fracturing relationship as each learns who they really married. Typically, stage productions are built around texts, but when the task is to recreate an expected experience from existing intellectual property, in this case, the Paranormal Activity movie franchise, nimbleness is required, and it seems that Holloway's play was instead purpose-built to deliver that experience foremost. That's not a bad thing, though, and he impressively hits the necessary notes to create a story that is both believable and able to tee up the night's biggest tricks. Holloway veers away from referential pastiche by rooting the story firmly in today, and delightfully invokes everyday technology to remind us that even if we're not being haunted, we're still being watched; Alexa, Zoom, FaceTime, and even “targeted ads” make appearances. Fry and Cochran also do their best with their characters, who are mostly devices, but Holloway's naturalism slips noticeably with puzzling, folksy lines like “You both look like flapjacks left in a skillet overnight” that land with a thud. Originally directed by Felix Barrett and restaged here by Holloway, Paranormal Activity is relentless in building intoxicating anticipation from the first blaring sound cue. Fly Davis' house set is big, expensive-looking, and — I don't know how else to put it — alive. Upstairs, Lou and James can finally find privacy from each other in a bedroom, bathroom, or nursery, but the same doors and walls that allow them to hide from each other may also be hiding the things they don't want to face. or if something is about to move in the darkness (will it? Across town at Studio Theatre, Octet, a chamber musical about “digital dependency,” has audiences locking away their devices to guarantee a “phone-free experience.” Paranormal Activity demands something similar of its audience, though no pouch is required; it moves so quickly and promises so intently that, without saying so, its directive is clear: you'd better not look away for a second. Yelps and screams abounded at the performance I saw, which inadvertently helped this wimp/wuss/weenie (and others like me, I'm sure) remember that it's only a play. At its best, theater is a kind of seance between the audience and the play, and even with its frozen-in-celluloid roots, Paranormal Activity facilitates that connection here with great success. There's a reason we return to Agatha Christie's murder mystery The Mousetrap and Noel Coward's supernatural comedy Blithe Spirit — a tradition that Paranormal Activity, simultaneously playing in London's West End, now joins. Even so, somehow jump scares feel good in a place like this. Paranormal Activity plays through February 7, 2025, in the Shakespeare Theatre Company's Harman Hall, 610 F Street NW, Washington, DC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OVER A LARGE BOX of untouched donuts in Washington's Longworth House Office Building, Congressional representatives sat rapt as a visiting Brazilian neurosurgeon described what it was like to stare back at the large lilac-colored eyes of a highly intelligent, nonhuman being. The closed-door session on Jan. 15 brought together three members of Congress seeking greater government transparency on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, long called UFOs, and a group of Brazilians who say they witnessed the crash of an otherworldly spacecraft and later encountered its nonhuman occupants. They were brought to the United States by filmmaker James Fox, who interviewed more than two dozen witnesses for a new feature documentary that expands on a 2022 version of his film Moment of Contact. Fox has been investigating the case, with his Brazilian counterpart Marco Aurelio Leal, for over two decades. Despite the difficulties in obtaining them, he said, “I never give up.” Susan Gough, a Pentagon spokesperson, did not reply to requests for comment. The Department of Defense All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), with a mission to scientifically investigate UAP, stated in a 2024 report that “none of these investigations (including USG, foreign, and U.S. academic efforts) reached the conclusion that any of the UAP reports indicated extraterrestrial origin.” At one point, AARO director Dr. Jon T. Kosloski came into the room. Fox says he asked Kosloski if there was a plan to inform the public about “what we are ultimately dealing with.” Kosloski replied, “I can't part my hair without the approval of the DOD. There is no question that the Varginha case lacks hard data. No one has yet been able to come up with photographs or videos, physical evidence, official documentation, or medical records that could help verify the episode. Burchett also pressed a question: “Was the being able to communicate in any way? Dr. Italo (as he prefers to be called), who was on duty that day in Regional Hospital in Varginha, said the captured being was initially treated by his colleague, Dr. Marcos Vinico Neves, who sutured a wound on its cranium. Neves died in 2018, and no medical records were kept of this procedure, according to Dr. Italo. He says he was shown a brief black and white video of the patient and then spent three or four minutes at its bedside, having been asked to visually examine it after the procedure. “I've been a doctor for forty-six years and have performed thousands of surgeries,” Dr. Italo said in an interview before the meeting. “What did the hands look like?” Luna asked. Dr. Italo demonstrated, holding up three fingers and a thumb. Burlison, taking notes, asked if it was wearing clothing. Burlison asked if any other medical staff or doctors could corroborate the story. Yes, said Dr. Italo, but most doctors are afraid to speak out because they have been threatened, or for fear of damage to their careers. “It's very important to get the others,” Burlison said. Dr. Italo said that a near-fatal heart attack and other recent medical issues persuaded him to break his silence last year and provide his full story to Fox for the first time, even though he still works full-time at Regional Hospital. He said he drove over to help any survivors and was overtaken by a strong odor of ammonia and rotten eggs. Picking up a piece of what looked like aluminum, de Sousa said he was able to crumple it in his fist, but it then immediately sprang back to its original shape. A soldier approached him and aimed a gun at his head, demanding, “Leave now, or I'll split your skull,” de Sousa said. Dropping the fragment, de Sousa fled, but said he was confronted shortly afterwards by two men in an unmarked dark vehicle who threatened his family and demanded his silence. He did not speak about the incident for decades. A third Brazilian visitor, Dr. Armando Fortunato, who has been a forensic pathologist and criminal medical examiner for the Civil Police for over three decades, told the representatives that he had performed an autopsy on a young military police officer, Marco Chereze, who had grabbed one of the beings during its capture and then died a few weeks later from a severe infection after it inadvertently scratched him. Dr. Armando, as he likes to be called, said a legal request has been filed to exhume Chereze's body with hopes of collecting bacteria—or even DNA samples—that could undergo further analysis. Dr. Armando handed the representatives a signed statement from Dr. João Janini, 89, a specialist in pathological anatomy whose biography states he has performed over 50,000 autopsies. Janini attested that he had found a rare form of a bacterium “of extremely high aggressiveness and lethality” in the tissue samples from Chereze. Accounts from former U.S. officials involving alleged UAP crash retrievals and related recoveries of nonhuman bodies have continued to surface, although the Defense Department dismisses them as unfounded. “Biologics came with some of these recoveries,” he asserted, referring to nonhuman bodies and tissue samples, citing “people with direct knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program.” Since then, other former officials with high security clearances have echoed his statements, sometimes under oath. McConnell told the audience that reports similar to those from the Varginha case reached senators and staff conducting these investigations. The reports provided to Congress included alleged hidden government activities similar to those recounted in the Varginha case, stretching across many decades. “So what these folks are going to tell you today are astounding, but they're not the only credible testimony about such events,” McConnell said. In addition to over 200,000 reports of anomalous objects in flight, Vallée said the database includes “hundreds of reports of creatures, live or dead, associated with crashed or landed vehicles of unknown provenance, including some similar to those in Varginha,” and that creatures in other documented cases breathed air normally. During the private discussion in Burchett's office, Dr. Italo said he had learned that the being he saw was taken to ESA military base, then to Campinas, and then to the States. Luna said Congress should seek Air Force flight logs and a landing permit to confirm any American retrieval operation of bodies and crash debris from Varginha, although it is uncertain whether any paper trail exists. Later, at the press conference, Col. Fred Claussen, a retired and highly decorated U.S. Air Force colonel who held a top-secret clearance, outlined ways the alleged secret U.S. mission might yet be documented. He said that a Brazilian air traffic controller, Marco Feres, reported that on or about Jan. 20, 1996, a U.S. Air Force cargo plane, most likely a C17, took off from an American base and landed at Viracopos airport in Campinas to pick up an unusual cargo before departing for an unknown location in the U.S. Any such cargo plane mission, the colonel said, would require paperwork from Air Mobility Command at Scott AFB in Illinois and the Air Mobility Wing at Charleston AFB in South Carolina. Air refueling would require more documentation, as would an international flight plan to Brazil, even if the mission were classified, Claussen said, adding that at Campinas, there would need to be more refueling records and another international flight plan. Even without a paper trail, he said he believed that thirty to forty Americans involved with the operation should have direct knowledge of this flight and its purpose. “If you were a participant and have knowledge of this mission, come forward.” McConnell followed by saying there was general misunderstanding that nondisclosure agreements signed by intelligence figures barred them from sharing their information about UAP recoveries with Congress. In fact, he said, “It's illegal to withhold information from Congress.” No one has ever been prosecuted for providing classified information to Congress, McConnell said. In fact, the President himself “could affirm disclosure to Congress with the stroke of a pen or [on] social media.” While greater UAP disclosure has been widely regarded as a bipartisan issue in Congress, “we're not yet at the tipping point for most members of Congress,” McConnell said. A joint evidence-seeking operation between Brazilians and Americans could be in the works. Brazilian Senator Eduardo Girão, who represents the coastal state of Ceará and led a Brazilian Senate hearing on UAP in 2022, came to Washington to meet with members of Congress and attend the press event. During a break, he spoke with Burlison, who said he had gotten up at 4 a.m. that morning to fly from Missouri so he could attend the news conference and present a public statement (the other members did not fly back in time to attend). This Battlefield Has No WiFi: How Starlink Internet Can Alter Autonomous AI Military Systems “Are there videos that you think you might be able to get access to, any other material evidence?” Burlison asked Girão. Burlison described having seen interesting UAP videos, but “nothing that is definitive 4K.” He told the Brazilian senator about key American officials who have come forward, including the current Secretary of State. Obtaining the evidence he would like to see has been difficult, Burlison said, because “there are several government entities that are controlling this and some are willing to be more cooperative, so unfortunately we're not getting everything.” So, in December, Fox and his producing partner, Aline Kras, returned to Brazil to compile their testimonies on videotape for presentation at the press conference. “When I saw it, I had a terrible feeling as if the world had stopped.” She screamed to alert the others. It had “three fingers on its hand, a big foot,” Katia said, adding: “It seemed he was suffering, asking me for help.” But she said it left behind a footprint with three large toes and an acrid odor that remained in her nose for several weeks. Yet another videotaped witness, unnamed and his face obscured, said he was in the army in 1996 and helped transport the being from the hospital in Varginha to Três Corações and from there to Campinas, where other soldiers took over. Upon returning to Três Corações, he said, “There was talk the Americans had the creature, having transported it to an undisclosed location.” He said that instantly, “I was not there as a doctor anymore. Fox said the videos of the entities are held by people too afraid to release them, but that for the first time, he may have the help of Brazilian Senator Girão and Representative Burlison, who is currently working on strengthening whistleblower protection for UAP witnesses. On Jan. 26, Rosangela Ramos appeared on camera with James Fox, saying that her late husband, Pedro Luiz Aguilar, the chief of police in Três Corações in 1996, who had been on duty during the incident, claimed he had also witnessed the creature, although she had no further details. At the news conference, Burlison called for international transparency. “If there's any government that's holding information about the knowledge of whether or not we are alone or not alone in the universe, that is not for any government, no matter how powerful it is, to withhold from the rest of humanity,” Burlison said, to general applause. Dr. Italo says he has no regrets about coming forward. “He was not a being from our planet. We are talking about something that changes the concept of humanity.” Additional materials related to this story, including written statements and video recordings of testimony from Brazilian witnesses, can be found here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OVER A LARGE BOX of untouched donuts in Washington's Longworth House Office Building, Congressional representatives sat rapt as a visiting Brazilian neurosurgeon described what it was like to stare back at the large lilac-colored eyes of a highly intelligent, nonhuman being. The closed-door session on Jan. 15 brought together three members of Congress seeking greater government transparency on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, long called UFOs, and a group of Brazilians who say they witnessed the crash of an otherworldly spacecraft and later encountered its nonhuman occupants. They were brought to the United States by filmmaker James Fox, who interviewed more than two dozen witnesses for a new feature documentary that expands on a 2022 version of his film Moment of Contact. Fox has been investigating the case, with his Brazilian counterpart Marco Aurelio Leal, for over two decades. Despite the difficulties in obtaining them, he said, “I never give up.” Susan Gough, a Pentagon spokesperson, did not reply to requests for comment. The Department of Defense All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), with a mission to scientifically investigate UAP, stated in a 2024 report that “none of these investigations (including USG, foreign, and U.S. academic efforts) reached the conclusion that any of the UAP reports indicated extraterrestrial origin.” But AARO may not have a free hand. At one point, AARO director Dr. Jon T. Kosloski came into the room. Fox says he asked Kosloski if there was a plan to inform the public about “what we are ultimately dealing with.” Kosloski replied, “I can't part my hair without the approval of the DOD. There is no question that the Varginha case lacks hard data. No one has yet been able to come up with photographs or videos, physical evidence, official documentation, or medical records that could help verify the episode. Burchett also pressed a question: “Was the being able to communicate in any way? Dr. Italo (as he prefers to be called), who was on duty that day in Regional Hospital in Varginha, said the captured being was initially treated by his colleague, Dr. Marcos Vinico Neves, who sutured a wound on its cranium. Neves died in 2018, and no medical records were kept of this procedure, according to Dr. Italo. He says he was shown a brief black and white video of the patient and then spent three or four minutes at its bedside, having been asked to visually examine it after the procedure. “I've been a doctor for forty-six years and have performed thousands of surgeries,” Dr. Italo said in an interview before the meeting. “What did the hands look like?” Luna asked. Dr. Italo demonstrated, holding up three fingers and a thumb. Burlison, taking notes, asked if it was wearing clothing. Burlison asked if any other medical staff or doctors could corroborate the story. Yes, said Dr. Italo, but most doctors are afraid to speak out because they have been threatened, or for fear of damage to their careers. “It's very important to get the others,” Burlison said. Dr. Italo said that a near-fatal heart attack and other recent medical issues persuaded him to break his silence last year and provide his full story to Fox for the first time, even though he still works full-time at Regional Hospital. He said he drove over to help any survivors and was overtaken by a strong odor of ammonia and rotten eggs. Picking up a piece of what looked like aluminum, de Sousa said he was able to crumple it in his fist, but it then immediately sprang back to its original shape. A soldier approached him and aimed a gun at his head, demanding, “Leave now, or I'll split your skull,” de Sousa said. Dropping the fragment, de Sousa fled, but said he was confronted shortly afterwards by two men in an unmarked dark vehicle who threatened his family and demanded his silence. He did not speak about the incident for decades. A third Brazilian visitor, Dr. Armando Fortunato, who has been a forensic pathologist and criminal medical examiner for the Civil Police for over three decades, told the representatives that he had performed an autopsy on a young military police officer, Marco Chereze, who had grabbed one of the beings during its capture and then died a few weeks later from a severe infection after it inadvertently scratched him. Dr. Armando, as he likes to be called, said a legal request has been filed to exhume Chereze's body with hopes of collecting bacteria—or even DNA samples—that could undergo further analysis. Dr. Armando handed the representatives a signed statement from Dr. João Janini, 89, a specialist in pathological anatomy whose biography states he has performed over 50,000 autopsies. Janini attested that he had found a rare form of a bacterium “of extremely high aggressiveness and lethality” in the tissue samples from Chereze. Accounts from former U.S. officials involving alleged UAP crash retrievals and related recoveries of nonhuman bodies have continued to surface, although the Defense Department dismisses them as unfounded. “Biologics came with some of these recoveries,” he asserted, referring to nonhuman bodies and tissue samples, citing “people with direct knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program.” Since then, other former officials with high security clearances have echoed his statements, sometimes under oath. McConnell told the audience that reports similar to those from the Varginha case reached senators and staff conducting these investigations. The reports provided to Congress included alleged hidden government activities similar to those recounted in the Varginha case, stretching across many decades. “So what these folks are going to tell you today are astounding, but they're not the only credible testimony about such events,” McConnell said. In addition to over 200,000 reports of anomalous objects in flight, Vallée said the database includes “hundreds of reports of creatures, live or dead, associated with crashed or landed vehicles of unknown provenance, including some similar to those in Varginha,” and that creatures in other documented cases breathed air normally. During the private discussion in Burchett's office, Dr. Italo said he had learned that the being he saw was taken to ESA military base, then to Campinas, and then to the States. Luna said Congress should seek Air Force flight logs and a landing permit to confirm any American retrieval operation of bodies and crash debris from Varginha, although it is uncertain whether any paper trail exists. Later, at the press conference, Col. Fred Claussen, a retired and highly decorated U.S. Air Force colonel who held a top-secret clearance, outlined ways the alleged secret U.S. mission might yet be documented. He said that a Brazilian air traffic controller, Marco Feres, reported that on or about Jan. 20, 1996, a U.S. Air Force cargo plane, most likely a C17, took off from an American base and landed at Viracopos airport in Campinas to pick up an unusual cargo before departing for an unknown location in the U.S. Any such cargo plane mission, the colonel said, would require paperwork from Air Mobility Command at Scott AFB in Illinois and the Air Mobility Wing at Charleston AFB in South Carolina. Air refueling would require more documentation, as would an international flight plan to Brazil, even if the mission were classified, Claussen said, adding that at Campinas, there would need to be more refueling records and another international flight plan. Even without a paper trail, he said he believed that thirty to forty Americans involved with the operation should have direct knowledge of this flight and its purpose. “If you were a participant and have knowledge of this mission, come forward.” McConnell followed by saying there was general misunderstanding that nondisclosure agreements signed by intelligence figures barred them from sharing their information about UAP recoveries with Congress. In fact, he said, “It's illegal to withhold information from Congress.” No one has ever been prosecuted for providing classified information to Congress, McConnell said. In fact, the President himself “could affirm disclosure to Congress with the stroke of a pen or [on] social media.” While greater UAP disclosure has been widely regarded as a bipartisan issue in Congress, “we're not yet at the tipping point for most members of Congress,” McConnell said. A joint evidence-seeking operation between Brazilians and Americans could be in the works. Brazilian Senator Eduardo Girão, who represents the coastal state of Ceará and led a Brazilian Senate hearing on UAP in 2022, came to Washington to meet with members of Congress and attend the press event. During a break, he spoke with Burlison, who said he had gotten up at 4 a.m. that morning to fly from Missouri so he could attend the news conference and present a public statement (the other members did not fly back in time to attend). Earth 2.0: Scientists Seek a Better Method for Finding Habitable Exoplanets “Are there videos that you think you might be able to get access to, any other material evidence?” Burlison asked Girão. Burlison described having seen interesting UAP videos, but “nothing that is definitive 4K.” He told the Brazilian senator about key American officials who have come forward, including the current Secretary of State. Obtaining the evidence he would like to see has been difficult, Burlison said, because “there are several government entities that are controlling this and some are willing to be more cooperative, so unfortunately we're not getting everything.” So, in December, Fox and his producing partner, Aline Kras, returned to Brazil to compile their testimonies on videotape for presentation at the press conference. “When I saw it, I had a terrible feeling as if the world had stopped.” She screamed to alert the others. It had “three fingers on its hand, a big foot,” Katia said, adding: “It seemed he was suffering, asking me for help.” But she said it left behind a footprint with three large toes and an acrid odor that remained in her nose for several weeks. Yet another videotaped witness, unnamed and his face obscured, said he was in the army in 1996 and helped transport the being from the hospital in Varginha to Três Corações and from there to Campinas, where other soldiers took over. Upon returning to Três Corações, he said, “There was talk the Americans had the creature, having transported it to an undisclosed location.” He said that instantly, “I was not there as a doctor anymore. Fox said the videos of the entities are held by people too afraid to release them, but that for the first time, he may have the help of Brazilian Senator Girão and Representative Burlison, who is currently working on strengthening whistleblower protection for UAP witnesses. On Jan. 26, Rosangela Ramos appeared on camera with James Fox, saying that her late husband, Pedro Luiz Aguilar, the chief of police in Três Corações in 1996, who had been on duty during the incident, claimed he had also witnessed the creature, although she had no further details. At the news conference, Burlison called for international transparency. “If there's any government that's holding information about the knowledge of whether or not we are alone or not alone in the universe, that is not for any government, no matter how powerful it is, to withhold from the rest of humanity,” Burlison said, to general applause. Dr. Italo says he has no regrets about coming forward. We are talking about something that changes the concept of humanity.” Additional materials related to this story, including written statements and video recordings of testimony from Brazilian witnesses, can be found here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2015, Ektaa Kapoor introduced supernatural fiction to audiences with Naagin. Starring Mouni Roy and Adaa Khan in the lead roles, the story of shape-shifting serpents became an overnight success. Over the last 11 years, the show has been loved across the country, and its latest season (Season 7) is currently airing on TV. Now, it seems like the filmmaker is set to take the franchise to the big screen.A source exclusively told India Today that Balaji Telefilms is in conversations to potentially expand the Naagin franchise beyond television. They mentioned that Ektaa is really excited to transform her TV show into a big-screen experience.“Given the brand's long-standing popularity and cinematic scale, the makers are exploring the possibility of adapting the franchise into a feature film, with the aim of reimagining the mythology for the big screen. The conversation is in the initial stage, but with the experience the team has had building seven successful seasons, it seems like the plan will turn into reality soon,” the source added.Even though the plan is still in its initial phase, there would be immense curiosity around who will get to play the titular role. Even on television, Ektaa is said to indulge in an extensive search for her ‘naagin' every season. Given it's one of her most prized projects, even the styling, costumes, and other details are personally looked into by her.Interestingly, producer Nikhil Dwivedi was also set to breathe new life into the iconic folklore of Naagin, with Shraddha Kapoor playing the lead character. However, there have been no updates on the film so far.And if a female Naagin wasn't enough, Karan Johar, along with Mahaveer Jain Films, is helming a fantasy comedy titled Naagzilla, featuring Kartik Aaryan in the role of Preyamvadeshwar Pyare Chand -- an icchadaari naag (shape-shifting snake). The film is reportedly set for release on Nag Panchami, August 14, 2026.- EndsPublished By: Pritinanda BeheraPublished On: Jan 30, 2026Also Read |  Ektaa Kapoor slams reuse of Pavitra Rishta title for new TV show: Terrible ethics</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It sucks to have your favorite NFL team get bounced before the Super Bowl — but it's an unfortunate fact of life for 30 fanbases. But in the vacuum that inevitably follows defeat, certain sects of NFL fans love to gin up a conspiracy theory that proves, actually, their favorite team was wronged rather than fairly beaten. Darnold and Maye play for the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, respectively, which are — you guessed it — the teams who'll face off in Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8. To be clear, lots of folks are joking about the "script" — it has become a meme after all — while a smaller number appear to genuinely believe this is evidence that the league is fixed. So many people posted about the image that NFL VP of Communications Brian McCarthy responded, writing on X, "Re: the 'controversy' over this image - no." Jokes and silly allegations of the NFL being rigged have been around for a while. The NFL itself has joked about fans claiming there's a "script," running an ad in 2023 where players do a table read of the next season. Despite the NFL itself making fun of the "script" theories, it's an idea that refuses to go away. In 2024, meanwhile, people were convinced the NFL was rigging results for the Kansas City Chiefs because, of all things, Taylor Swift was dating Travis Kelce. As I wrote at the time, the NFL is not capable of pulling that off and, even if it were, would never risk its billions of dollars in profits for something so trivial. Hell, if you look at the image closely, Tampa Bay's Baker Mayfield and New York's Malik Nabers both appear to be closer or just as close to the trophy. Neither of those teams even made the playoffs. You'll also see some coverage of memes, tech, sports, trends, and the occasional hot take. You can find him on Bluesky (sometimes), Instagram (infrequently), or eating Buffalo wings (as often as possible).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 30 (UPI) -- One of the longest-running searches for extraterrestrial life is coming to end this year as U.S. scientists wrap up a popular program that enlisted millions of home computer users to analyze radio signals received from space. After years poring through immense amounts of generated data, the program's co-founders at the University of California at Berkeley told UPI this week they are probing 100 detected signals deemed to be the best candidates for messages from "ET" before the effort is wrapped up for good, 27 years after it was launched. But even though the "SETI@home" project has so far failed to record a "first contact" from an alien civilization, its leaders say valuable lessons have been learned that can be applied to the continuing hunt for beyond Earth. SETI@home, short for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, was launched in 1999 by scientists at UC Berkeley who over the course of two-plus decades enlisted more than 5 million "crowdsourced" volunteers willing to donate their home computers' processing capacity to analyze data generated by momentary energy blips picked up by the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. It was one of the pioneering efforts at distributed computing in an era before supercomputers and high-speed Internet connections. Under the project, home users downloaded and installed free software that could pick out signals deemed to be "ET" candidates from raw data supplied by the 1,000-foot radio telescope at Arecibo, which collapsed in 2020 The observatory was damaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and rebuilt, but it met its end a little more than three years later because filled spelter sockets that anchored the massive support cables had been undergoing long-term chemical and mechanical degradation. From its data, the home computer users ultimately produced 12 billion detections. The vast majority turned out to be radio frequency interference from man-made sources, such as satellites and earthbound radio and television broadcasts, but researchers for years continued to doggedly plow through the possibilities. Billions of "candidate" radio signals narrowed to final 100 Project co-founder David Anderson of UC Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory said he and his team spent a decade narrowing down that massive list to 1 million candidates and then to a final 100, which are now being investigated using China's 500-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, also known as FAST, in hopes of finding them again. And after that's completed, the long-running program will officially be a wrap, in part because it has now reached point of diminishing scientific returns. "And of course, there was a lot of work involved in removing the man-made interference from from these things and ranking them, because at some point we had to go through them and manually inspect the signal candidates to get rid of the ones that are obviously interference. To guide the development of those algorithms, Anderson and his team used artificial candidates, or "birdies," that modeled persistent ET signals within a range of power and bandwidth parameters. "Whether there is extraterrestrial life is kind of the most important unanswered scientific question at this point, and so I think we knew that we'd get some users," he said. "We got a lot of national media coverage at right at the beginning, and within the first year we had close to 1 million participants. "Whenever you start a project with a large public-facing component, there's always the fear in a lot of peoples' minds that you are going to do something wrong and you're going to turn people off the entire field. "But, of course, I think that wasn't the case. Many people still want to have a connection to this sort of science, Korpela said, adding, "I think that is really a large part of our legacy." Others praise, assess impact of SETI@home Other researchers and organizations deeply involved in the search for extraterrestrial life also praised the accomplishments and legacy of SETI@home as it wraps up its mission. One of them is the National Science Foundation National Radio Astronomy Observatory and Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, trailblazers in radio astronomy and operators of Breakthrough Listen, described as the largest ever scientific research program aimed at finding evidence of civilizations beyond Earth. "While what we find with our telescopes may not be as dramatic as we hope, like a sci-fi movie, it's still exciting to have our work overlap with the search." Similarly, prominent astrobiologist and SETI researcher Douglas Vakoch said SETI@home revolutionized the search for life in the universe by solving one of the greatest challenges of looking for intelligence in space, and that by doing so "directly inspired a new generation of researchers who are attempting first contact by sending powerful radio messages to the stars." Vakoch is president of METI International, a nonprofit research and educational organization dedicated to messaging extraterrestrial intelligence, and editor of many academic works in several fields. He told UPI that SETI@home was a breakthrough in that it was able to combine "mainstream astronomy" with the search for extraterrestrials, which researchers must "constantly struggle to justify" as they seek precious telescope time. "As astronomers pointed the Arecibo radio telescope at targets of their choice, SETI@home also analyzed the incoming data, but this time for signals that can't be created by nature. SETI@home was designed so scientists could conduct mainstream astronomy and simultaneously determine whether we're alone in the universe." in that way, instead of becoming an obstacle to astronomers seeking time on the world's largest radio telescope, SETI@home "helped foster public support and recognition for space science." Its greatest legacy, he said, is that it is now "guiding the next generation of interstellar communication," including Vakoch's own METI project, which rather than listening for radio signals from space as SETI does, reverses the process by sending powerful radio signals to nearby stars in the hope of eliciting a response from an advanced civilization. "It was a 'whole sky' project that covered the everything visible from Arecibo, and there's there's a lot of technical things that we did, some of which were right and others we would do differently if we had to go back," he said. "So we learned a lot of lessons about how to do radio astronomy, and we published two papers last year describing them."

PAUL, Minn., Jan. 30 (UPI) -- One of the longest-running searches for extraterrestrial life is coming to end this year as U.S. scientists wrap up a popular program that enlisted millions of home computer users to analyze radio signals received from space. After years poring through immense amounts of generated data, the program's co-founders at the University of California at Berkeley told UPI this week they are probing 100 detected signals deemed to be the best candidates for messages from "ET" before the effort is wrapped up for good, 27 years after it was launched. But even though the "SETI@home" project has so far failed to record a "first contact" from an alien civilization, its leaders say valuable lessons have been learned that can be applied to the continuing hunt for beyond Earth. SETI@home, short for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, was launched in 1999 by scientists at UC Berkeley who over the course of two-plus decades enlisted more than 5 million "crowdsourced" volunteers willing to donate their home computers' processing capacity to analyze data generated by momentary energy blips picked up by the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. It was one of the pioneering efforts at distributed computing in an era before supercomputers and high-speed Internet connections. Under the project, home users downloaded and installed free software that could pick out signals deemed to be "ET" candidates from raw data supplied by the 1,000-foot radio telescope at Arecibo, which collapsed in 2020 The observatory was damaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and rebuilt, but it met its end a little more than three years later because filled spelter sockets that anchored the massive support cables had been undergoing long-term chemical and mechanical degradation. From its data, the home computer users ultimately produced 12 billion detections. The vast majority turned out to be radio frequency interference from man-made sources, such as satellites and earthbound radio and television broadcasts, but researchers for years continued to doggedly plow through the possibilities. Project co-founder David Anderson of UC Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory said he and his team spent a decade narrowing down that massive list to 1 million candidates and then to a final 100, which are now being investigated using China's 500-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, also known as FAST, in hopes of finding them again. And after that's completed, the long-running program will officially be a wrap, in part because it has now reached point of diminishing scientific returns. "And of course, there was a lot of work involved in removing the man-made interference from from these things and ranking them, because at some point we had to go through them and manually inspect the signal candidates to get rid of the ones that are obviously interference. To guide the development of those algorithms, Anderson and his team used artificial candidates, or "birdies," that modeled persistent ET signals within a range of power and bandwidth parameters. "Whether there is extraterrestrial life is kind of the most important unanswered scientific question at this point, and so I think we knew that we'd get some users," he said. "We got a lot of national media coverage at right at the beginning, and within the first year we had close to 1 million participants. "Whenever you start a project with a large public-facing component, there's always the fear in a lot of peoples' minds that you are going to do something wrong and you're going to turn people off the entire field. "But, of course, I think that wasn't the case. Many people still want to have a connection to this sort of science, Korpela said, adding, "I think that is really a large part of our legacy." Other researchers and organizations deeply involved in the search for extraterrestrial life also praised the accomplishments and legacy of SETI@home as it wraps up its mission. One of them is the National Science Foundation National Radio Astronomy Observatory and Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, trailblazers in radio astronomy and operators of Breakthrough Listen, described as the largest ever scientific research program aimed at finding evidence of civilizations beyond Earth. "While what we find with our telescopes may not be as dramatic as we hope, like a sci-fi movie, it's still exciting to have our work overlap with the search." Similarly, prominent astrobiologist and SETI researcher Douglas Vakoch said SETI@home revolutionized the search for life in the universe by solving one of the greatest challenges of looking for intelligence in space, and that by doing so "directly inspired a new generation of researchers who are attempting first contact by sending powerful radio messages to the stars." Vakoch is president of METI International, a nonprofit research and educational organization dedicated to messaging extraterrestrial intelligence, and editor of many academic works in several fields. He told UPI that SETI@home was a breakthrough in that it was able to combine "mainstream astronomy" with the search for extraterrestrials, which researchers must "constantly struggle to justify" as they seek precious telescope time. "As astronomers pointed the Arecibo radio telescope at targets of their choice, SETI@home also analyzed the incoming data, but this time for signals that can't be created by nature. SETI@home was designed so scientists could conduct mainstream astronomy and simultaneously determine whether we're alone in the universe." in that way, instead of becoming an obstacle to astronomers seeking time on the world's largest radio telescope, SETI@home "helped foster public support and recognition for space science." Its greatest legacy, he said, is that it is now "guiding the next generation of interstellar communication," including Vakoch's own METI project, which rather than listening for radio signals from space as SETI does, reverses the process by sending powerful radio signals to nearby stars in the hope of eliciting a response from an advanced civilization. "It was a 'whole sky' project that covered the everything visible from Arecibo, and there's there's a lot of technical things that we did, some of which were right and others we would do differently if we had to go back," he said.</p>
