                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Having touched a new record of $120 per ounce earlier in the session, silver has pulled back to $75 in U.S. afternoon hours, now lower by 35% for the day. Gold — which as recently as Sunday had never seen $5,000 per ounce — climbed to $5,600 at one point Thursday, but has now retreated to $4,718, down 12% for the day. While crypto bulls might be used to such action, only those precious metals traders who were around during the days of the Hunt Brothers in 1980 will be familiar with that sort of downside volatility. U.S. stocks are selling off as well, the Nasdaq down 1.25% and S&P 500 0.9%. After plunging earlier in the week, cryptocurrencies, by comparison, are moving somewhat sideways on Friday, holding above Thursday evening's panicky lows. Bitcoin was trading around $83,000 recently versus its overnight bottom of $81,000. The action in markets has been volatile all week, but this latest bout appears to have been set off by President Trump's picking Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair. Paul Howard, director at trading firm Wincent, spoke for many crypto bulls, saying the parabolic move in commodities in recent months had siphoned risk capital from crypto markets. "The outlook indicates what a lot of crypto traders are feeling right now — that their market is long overdue a commodity-style catch-up," Howard added. “What was meant to be a bullish move for the markets appears to have coincided with a broad risk sell-off,” Howard said of the nomination of Kevin Warsh. “The reaction may be more of a knee-jerk as markets recalibrate.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Otters, a fast-growing Telegram Mini App built on the TON blockchain, is redefining how everyday users discover, engage with, and adopt Web3 through simple, social, and rewarding experiences. Built natively inside Telegram, Otters removes the friction that has historically kept millions of users away from crypto. Instead of wallets, bridges, and complex onboarding flows, Otters introduces Web3 through familiar mechanics like daily rewards, short farming cycles, social competition, and in-app mini games, all accessible in just a few taps. At its core, Otters transforms Web3 participation into something playful and social. Unlike many Telegram mini apps that focus only on speculative rewards, Otters prioritizes habit-forming engagement and long-term retention. One of Otters' most notable innovations is the TON Badge, a premium on-chain verification feature. By completing a small TON transaction through the integrated wallet, users unlock a verified badge that appears beside their username inside the app. It enables access to peer-to-peer Quick Share transfers, enhances trust within the community, and establishes a verified identity layer inside Telegram. Otters is among the first Telegram Mini Apps to successfully gamify user verification and permissioned P2P access using on-chain mechanics. Otters has recently launched its in-app NFT Collection Store, allowing users to mint official Otters NFT collections directly on the TON blockchain without leaving Telegram. Through the store, users can purchase and mint NFTs that are delivered straight to their connected wallet on-chain. This approach removes the need for external marketplaces or complex minting steps, making NFT ownership accessible to a broader audience while preserving full on-chain transparency. The NFT Store marks a key milestone in Otters' roadmap, expanding the ecosystem beyond rewards and gameplay into digital ownership and long-term utility. The app already supports TON wallet connections, on-chain transactions, premium features, and modular reward systems. Upcoming releases include the $OTR token generation event, a full claiming system, deeper ecosystem partnerships, and listings across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team is also preparing Otters v2, a major application rebuild focused on performance, design consistency, and expanded social mechanics. Otters is currently opening discussions with strategic partners and early-stage investors to accelerate growth, strengthen liquidity planning, and expand distribution ahead of its token launch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company is stockpiling more than a ton of the precious metal every week in the Swiss mountains to back its gold-pegged XAUT Token—an attention-grabbing security measure once employed by a Bitcoin firm from crypto's early days. Tether currently owns an estimated $24 billion in gold, the most of any holder outside of governments, central banks, and major ETFs. As a new Fortune magazine feature reveals, the gold hoarding reflects a belief on the part of Tether's CEO that Western economies are unraveling and that his firm can be an anchor of stability in an unstable world. One of the first crypto custody firms, Xapo, would store customers' Bitcoin in a bunker under a Swiss mountain. During this rally, gold has climbed 83% in the last year, even as Bitcoin—the so-called “digital gold—posted a 20% decline. Investors are betting against the dollar, which is supposed to be a recipe for success for those in the crypto world. Instead, traders are pouring money into gold and leaving Bitcoin behind. Younger investors have touted cryptocurrency as the future of finance and a pathway to get richer, quicker. To their disgust, buyers of gold, typically associated with older generations, are cashing in winnings. Last year was a letdown for crypto enthusiasts, and 2026 isn't looking much better. One analyst argues that Bitcoin could sink even more, given the turbulent macroeconomic environment. “I do not think that low 70s is out of the question in Bitcoin – not today specifically, going to depend a lot on what happens with Iran and general overall sentiment,” said Russell Thompson, CIO of Hilbert Group.

Oops, something went wrong

Vitalik Buterin has withdrawn 16,384 ETH (c. $44.7 million) to support the ongoing growth and development of Ethereum, declaring that the Ethereum Foundation has entered a period of “mild austerity” in which some goals may be prioritized over others.

In a lengthy tweet, the Ethereum co-founder argues that such austerity is necessary for the Foundation to achieve two interrelated goals: the realization of an “aggressive” roadmap that advances Ethereum's utility as a decentralized “world computer”; and the protection of users' ability to access Ethereum “with self-sovereignty, security and privacy.”

Coming as the price of Ethereum falls to a six-month low of $2,710, Buterin's post also revealed that he will taking more of a leading role in special development projects, with a particular focus on producing open-source applications in such areas as finance, communication, governance, operating systems, biotech, and secure hardware.

He said, “If you have seen [...] my own enthusiasm and use for privacy-preserving, walkaway-test-friendly and local-first software (including operating systems), then you know the general spirit of what I am planning to support.”

It was here that Buterin noted he had withdrawn 16,384 ETH from his own funds to pursue such goals “over the next few years,” and that he will also seek out “decentralized staking options” in order to grow the pool of available funds.

Decrypt has reached out to the Ethereum Foundation for comment.

While the use of the term “austerity” may potentially alarm some observers, particularly during a bearish market, some commentators emphasize that Buterin's intent is much more about directing funding to valuable R&D activities than limiting funding altogether.

“I read the comment as one about focus, on building the protocol in a particular direction,” said Lex Sokolin, Managing Partner at Generative Ventures, and the former chief economist at ConsenSys.

Speaking to Decrypt, Sokolin noted how ETH has largely traded sideways over the past few years, and that Buterin's comments are a sign of recognition that “narrative-driven investment” is no longer very effective as a source of growth for onchain projects and Ethereum more generally.

“All things have to show fundamentals, not just conferences and unicorns,” he said. “We have seen compression in value in prior R&D ideas like restaking, zero-knowledge L2s, and so on.”

Ethereum's Oldest Crisis Reborn as a $220 Million Security Fund

Sokolin also explained that, with the wider market mostly focused on real-world assets, stablecoins and other commercial activities, the Ethereum Foundation will have to step in to fund things that may not be commercially viable off the bat, but that are still essential to Ethereum's development.

“I think Vitalik will fund projects that are important to him—open source, privacy and self sovereignty focused—outside of the Ethereum Foundation,” he explained.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please be vigilant about TRM impersonation scams, especially those claiming to assist with fund recovery. See how leading agencies and organizations are disrupting crypto crime with blockchain intelligence On January 28, 2026, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the arrest of a teacher at La Costa Canyon High School in Carlsbad, California, on charges related to the possession and attempted possession of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Historically, CSAM investigations are among the most difficult and resource-intensive cases in law enforcement. When cryptocurrency is used as a payment rail, investigators can begin with financial traces, build an evidentiary path from known seller infrastructure to suspected purchasers, and use that financial trail to support lawful process, including search warrants and device seizures. The probable cause affidavit filed in the Wachner matter provides a clear, step-by-step blueprint for how blockchain tracing is operationalized in CSAM investigations when digital assets are used. That matters because it underscores a key reality: regulated platforms, when they detect patterns or exposure consistent with CSAM-related typologies, can generate actionable leads that allow investigators to move quickly. First, investigators learn the beneficial person behind a cryptocurrency transaction through an exchange's records and ‘Know-Your-Customer' details. That provides a lawful anchor for the analysis: the suspect is not identified by a wallet address alone, but through records tying account activity to an individual. The affidavit describes how TRM documented the CSAM's seller's address as CSAM; in this case, backed up by screenshots, on-chain patterns, and transactions consistent with obfuscation techniques. These cases illustrate a growing intersection of child exploitation investigations and financial technology. For law enforcement, the practical implication is that blockchain intelligence can help identify suspects, map networks, and accelerate investigative disruptions more efficiently, particularly when investigators already have exposure points to known seller infrastructure. For the financial and compliance ecosystem, the implication is that platform monitoring and alerting can serve as a critical early warning system, surfacing activity that may otherwise remain buried behind encrypted channels. First, it suggests certain seller ecosystems have normalized crypto as a payment mechanism, sometimes relying on token-based purchasing and deposit-address structures. Second, it shows why the crypto angle is not simply that digital assets can be used in crimes. It is that the public, immutable nature of many blockchains can produce investigative advantages when paired with compliance monitoring, lawful process, and expert analysis. Officials emphasize that educators and other trusted community figures are not immune from scrutiny when evidence points to online abuse material, and that cryptocurrency is not beyond the reach of law enforcement. Some CSAM sellers use digital assets because they believe crypto provides anonymity, and recent arrests suggest that even trusted community figures, including educators, have allegedly exploited these payment methods to access abuse material online. Blockchain intelligence allows investigators to trace immutable transactions between suspected purchasers and known CSAM seller infrastructure, map networks, identify patterns, and generate financial evidence that supports lawful process. Regulated platforms can generate CyberTips or suspicious activity reports when CSAM-related typologies are detected, providing investigators an early entry point and tying blockchain activity to real-world identities through KYC records. CSAM investigations often involve encrypted forums, anonymous networks, and horrific content, requiring intensive investigative resources. Blockchain tracing can help shift the starting point from hidden communications to financial evidence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That leaves the long tail fighting for scraps even in “recoveries.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry. His expertise primarily focuses on the Brazilian blockchain ecosystem and developments in decentralized finance (DeFi). Bitcoin crashes, rebounds, and a few altcoins follow after. Yet, that small- or medium-cap crypto with promising fundamentals never followed through. The answer has less to do with the coin's fundamentals and more to do with how crypto's microstructure has fundamentally reshaped itself. The “investable altcoin market” has contracted into a top-heavy pyramid in which new liquidity doesn't rotate down the capitalization curve. Instead, it concentrates in majors and occasionally in ETF-credible large caps, while the long tail gets brief, thin narrative pops that fade within weeks. Top 10 altcoins now command roughly 82% of the altcoin market cap excluding Bitcoin, per Coin Metrics analyst Tanay Ved. That's up from a range of 69-73% maintained across 2020-2024, and well above the 64% low reached during the 2021 bull run. The breadth that defined “alt season” has evaporated. Coin Metrics tracks that altcoins with market caps above $1 billion fell from roughly 105 at the 2021 peak to just 58. The headline statistic that “thousands of tokens exist” is misleading, as the liquid, scalable set has contracted by nearly half. In a recovery where capital allocation rules don't change, most marginal dollars land in the top bucket. The long tail competes for leftovers while absorbing ongoing emissions and unlocks. Recoveries no longer function as a “rising tide lifts all boats” effect because liquidity enters crypto through channels that don't naturally spill into microcaps. Wintermute's 2025 OTC report argues that how capital entered crypto mattered as much as how much came in. ETFs and digital asset treasury vehicles concentrate flows into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a narrow set of large caps, with limited organic rotation into the broader token universe. Spot Bitcoin ETF assets under management hover around $122 billion at the current $85,000 price level. Small caps don't just need a pump, but also need time and depth to build sustained bids. The market's “liquidity surface” is thinner than it looks. CCData's December 2025 exchange review reports that combined spot and derivatives volumes fell 26.4% to $5.79 trillion, the lowest level since October 2024. Execution metrics focused on 1% market depth indicate that when depth declines, the same trade size moves the price more violently and makes follow-through more difficult. During recent stress, the S&P 500 fell roughly 1.5%, gold shed 1%, while Bitcoin dropped 5%. This movement reinforces that crypto continues to behave as leveraged beta for risk assets. This unstable relationship makes institutional allocators wary of anything below the majors when risk appetite fragments. Equities sit at or near all-time highs, with the S&P 500 sitting at 6,927.40 after crossing 7,000 on AI optimism and expectations of Federal Reserve cuts. Meanwhile, the crypto market cap slid below $3 trillion, down by 5.1%. Stablecoin “dry powder” isn't expanding as it did before, reaching an all-time high above $310 billion in mid-January, before contracting to $308 billion. If stablecoin supply isn't growing, the market fights over a relatively fixed pool of deployable liquidity, and it crowds into liquid names. Small tokens face an additional headwind that majors absorb more easily: supply unlocks and dilution. Market maker Keyrock's analysis found that token unlocks frequently create downward price pressure, with effects beginning weeks before the unlock. Market-moving headlines and context delivered every morning in one tight read. Additionally, small-cap tokens reached a four-year low, indicating that the alt season thesis is dead. The path forward splits into three distinct scenarios, each with observable tells. An institution-led recovery, which is the most probable path if ETFs remain the primary on-ramp, will involve Bitcoin and Ethereum outperforming, with large caps leading while small caps lag and breadth remaining narrow. The signals: stablecoin supply growing materially rather than staying flat, more tokens re-entering the “>$1 billion investable” set and reversing Coin Metrics' documented shrinkage, and narrative cycles lengthening back toward 2024-style durations. This scenario requires ammunition: an expanding stablecoin supply that creates a pool that can rotate down the cap curve. Majors absorb what liquidity remains, the tail bleeds via unlocks and emissions, and random pumps get even shorter. This scenario will include cross-asset signals such as gold bid versus Bitcoin weakness, large unlock weeks landing into thin depth, and further compression of rally windows. Wintermute itself points to 2026 catalysts for broader participation: ETF and digital-asset treasury mandates expanding beyond major asset managers, Bitcoin and Ethereum wealth effects creating rotation appetite, and retail mindshare returning. These are the conditions, not guarantees, under which small caps might catch a sustained bid. Tokens outside the top 10 now require a different recovery than Bitcoin. They need expanding stablecoin ammunition, a longer narrative half-life, and enough depth to absorb new supply. Without those conditions, the rebound stays concentrated in majors. The market has revealed its preference structure: when capital is scarce, it seeks liquidity and credibility. Reversing it requires either a substantial expansion of deployable capital or a fundamental shift in how institutional and retail capital flows into crypto. Until one of those conditions materializes, small-cap holders face a market structure that works against them by design. The “alt season” thesis didn't just die, it was buried under a collapsing liquidity pyramid where only the apex thrives. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. The market just discovered exactly how much hidden leverage was propping up prices before the floor fell out. Bitcoin is below its 2 year moving average again, and traders fear this signal could trigger a brutal capitulation. Bitcoin faces a macro inflection window as the Fed's Jan. 28 decision meets dollar weakness and a Supreme Court case seen as testing Fed independence. HSBC wants investors aggressively long risk, but Bitcoin's DXY link is basically dead right now. Our writers' opinions are solely their own and do not reflect the opinion of CryptoSlate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's reasonable to say that this coin isn't behaving like a safe harbor asset right now. Bitcoin (BTC +0.46%) is having one of those periods that make even its evangelists a bit tense. It's down by 17% over the last 12 months as I write this, and 22% over the last three months. Sentiment about the coin hasn't been this bad in years. The short-term mechanism of Bitcoin getting beaten down is quite simple. For the last 12 months, there's been a new problem every week or so. There has been absolutely no shortage of these chaotic happenings, and there will probably not be any reprieve for a few years. And when these threats escalate, investors tend to trim risk assets like Bitcoin. But if you're buying an asset to hold it for years, the headlines in any given week are really not all that important. After all, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it isn't a fiat currency that a government can just print more of. This is to say that no matter how mediocre its performance has been in these turbulent times, its core investment thesis still holds as strong as ever. I expect the coin's price to be significantly higher within a few years. Nonetheless, there is one risk that I view as being potentially deadly for Bitcoin, and it's something I am paying very close attention to. At some point in the future, likely more than five years from now, a quantum computer might be powerful enough to crack Bitcoin's encryption and steal coins. That'd be a massive problem for every holder if it happens. But, it's already theoretically possible to mitigate this threat. Bitcoin has to choose and deploy its own mitigation path, which will take some time, but  its developer community is already in the process of evaluating what the best course of action is. In the long run, I expect Bitcoin to navigate this obstacle, and that's why I still have the confidence to keep buying it now. Bitcoin can behave badly this week without there being a long-term problem. I still buy it because the long-term upside comes from inherent properties, specifically its supply policy, while the scariest downside has a plausible path to mitigation that's already starting to move forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drop Protocol emerged as a significant innovation within the Cosmos ecosystem, creating an open-source liquid staking solution to facilitate better capital efficiency across decentralized finance (DeFi). Conventional systems restricted the usability of staked assets within the DeFi landscape, but Drop Protocol introduced ‘dAssets' such as dATOM or dTIA, which represented staked tokens and their accumulated rewards. These could be freely traded, used as collateral for loans, or added to liquidity pools. By promoting interoperability across chains, users enjoyed enhanced flexibility with their staked capital. The project, which gathered $4 million in seed funding, quickly established itself as a crucial piece of infrastructure for interchain staking. The Droplets Program was set up to boost early adoption of Drop Protocol. It offered rewards for on-chain activities such as staking specific assets like ATOM or TIA and participating in various DeFi strategies. Rewards were calculated based on the amount and duration of assets staked, encouraging continuous engagement over passive participation. This program intended to distribute 100 million $DROP tokens, with a significant portion earmarked for participants. Eligibility for the ATOM airdrop is straightforward—participants must have held at least one Droplet with their activities recorded in a snapshot on November 13, 2025. Eligible users can claim their ATOM tokens through the Drop Protocol interface. Its legacy lies in the innovative approach to unlocking capital efficiency and promoting greater ecosystem interoperability. This conclusion, while not as initially planned, affirms the value of their contributions to the protocol's brief but impactful operation. We do not share any kind of investment advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) fell sharply during early U.S. trading this week, triggering widespread liquidations across cryptocurrency exchanges, according to data from crypto.news. More than 90% of the liquidated contracts were long positions, primarily in Bitcoin and Ether, according to reports. The rapid price decline forced margin calls and triggered stop orders across trading platforms. Price gaps appeared on some exchanges as volatility increased, according to market observers. A U.S. warship deployment and public statements from U.S. President Donald Trump increased pressure on risk assets. Bitcoin was trading near a higher-timeframe support level that has been significant in recent months, according to technical analysts. Weekly price closes have remained within a recent range for several weeks. Some analysts characterized the market reaction as excessive, noting that prices had been declining since October. Others warned that a prolonged correction could continue if macroeconomic pressures persist.

The Hogan core banking platform currently supports over 300 million deposit accounts and manages more than $5trillion in global deposits. By embedding Ripple's technology into this environment, the partnership offers a bridge between traditional finance and the “onchain” economy for a vast network of existing banking clients. Sandeep Bhanote, global head and general manager of financial services at DXC, emphasized the necessity of this infrastructure for mass adoption: “For digital assets to move into the financial mainstream, institutions need secure custody and seamless payment capabilities. Our work with Ripple brings those capabilities together in a way that allows banks to engage in the digital asset ecosystem without changing their core systems, connecting traditional accounts, wallets and decentralized platforms at enterprise scale.” Joanie Xie, vice president and managing director, North America at Ripple, noted that the collaboration brings specific assets—including digital asset custody and RLUSD (Ripple's stablecoin)—directly into trusted environments. “Together, we're enabling banks to deliver secure, compliant digital asset use cases at enterprise scale without disruption.” The initiative will utilize Ripple Payments for managing fund flows and Ripple Custody for the secure management of digital assets, stablecoins, and Real World Assets (RWAs).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Instead of one shared currency, BRICS is working on a digital payment system that links national digital currencies like India's e-rupee, China's e-yuan and Russia's e-ruble. As India prepares to host the BRICS summit later this year, amid rumours of a “BRICS currency” to replace the US dollar, the focus is expected to be on a shared payment system that links national digital currencies. Here's all you need to know about a BRICS payment system. However, the proposals for a common currency ran into obvious problems: different inflation regimes, capital controls, and fears that China's yuan would dominate any shared system. However, this new approach, a BRICS payment system built on interoperable central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), could avoid all of that. Also read | How safe is the rupee from Trump's tantrums? Each country keeps full control over its own currency. In simple terms, it would allow countries to settle trade directly in their own digital currencies, without routing payments through correspondent banks or the dollar-based SWIFT network. India is playing a central role in shaping this direction. Summit host New Delhi has consistently pushed for interoperability rather than monetary integration, a philosophy shaped by its own digital payments success at home through Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The emphasis is on building systems that talk to each other while preserving sovereignty. Earlier trade settlements with Russia left Moscow holding large amounts of rupees it could not easily spend, the so-called “rupee trap”. A multilateral system, rather than bilateral deals, helps prevent currencies from piling up uselessly. Also read | Economic Survey 2025–26: India needs 8% growth to become ‘Viksit Bharat' by 2047 The proposed BRICS payment system rests on two technical ideas: settlement cycles and forex swap lines. Settlement cycles mean countries do not settle every transaction instantly. Forex swap lines, meanwhile, act as a safety valve. If one country suddenly needs more of another's currency to settle its balance, central banks can temporarily swap currencies to smooth things over. The dollar still dominates global finance, making up around 59 per cent of global reserves and about 58 per cent of international payments. But there is growing anxiety about how fragile that system has become. Global debt stands at around $315 trillion, 64 per cent of which is denominated in dollars. If global demand for dollar assets weakens, US borrowing costs rise. That tightens financial conditions everywhere and can trigger cascading crises. While Iran, North Korea and Cuba have also faced similar measures before, Russia proved that even major economies are not immune. A parallel system that keeps trade functioning if the main one breaks down. The BRICS payment system will take some time to come into practice as most CBDCs are still in pilot stages. Legal frameworks and technical standards also vary wildly among the BRICS countries. The likely path is gradual - starting with bilateral links, then stitching them into a network. Its UPI is already interoperable with the UAE's payment system, enabling fast cross-border transfers. Over time, this could evolve into a shared BRICS payment layer.

Bitcoin sank below $84,000 to hit levels last seen in April. Trading volume surged 64% over the last 24 hours, signaling high selling pressure. Ethereum dived to $2,751, its worst since early July, while XRP and Dogecoin recorded sharp drops. Shares of cryptocurrency-related companies, including Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR)  and Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BMNR), closed down 9.63% and 9.89%, respectively About  $1.74 billion was liquidated from the market in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass, with $1.64 billion in levered longs alone wiped out. Bitcoin's open interest fell 2.24% in the last 24 hours to $58.34 billion. Major indexes closed in the red on Thursday. Spot gold fell 0.85% to $5,329.63 per ounce, after reaching new highs of $5,590 earlier in the session. In a note shared with Benzinga, analysts at cryptocurrency payment company B2BINPAY noted Ethereum's two month-long consolidation phase. "In other words, demand and supply are currently balanced." Ali Martinez, a well-known cryptocurrency trader and analyst, derived $98,643, $121,482 and $144,321 as key resistance levels for Bitcoin from the Market Value to Realized Value pricing bands. These pricing bands use statistical deviation from the Market Value to Realized Value ratio's all-time average to identify potential market tops and bottoms. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) sparked the tech sell-off, plunging 10% in its worst day since March 2020 after analysts slashed price targets amid CapEx worries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin order-book analysis said that BTC price action was being held back by just one trading entity, while risking a trip to "Bearadise." Bitcoin (BTC) lingered beneath $88,000 into Thursday's Wall Street open as attention switched to order-book manipulation. Bitcoin is facing fresh attempts to manipulate short-term price action, says analysis. Wyckoff BTC price bottom calls grow more confident as the monthly close nears. Data from TradingView showed ongoing BTC price weakness, with BTC/USD acting in an increasingly narrow range. In his latest analysis of exchange order-book liquidity, Keith Alan, cofounder of trading resource Material Indicators, had a theory as to why Bitcoin could no longer beat resistance. “FireCharts shows $BTC price is being suppressed by one entity using a liquidity herding strategy to push price lower, potentially to get their own bids filled, or possible to keep price pinned in the lower end of this range before Friday's options expiry,” he told X followers on the day. Alan referred to one of Material Indicators' proprietary trading tools covering liquidations at key nearby price levels, as well as whale order volume. As Cointelegraph reported, large-volume entities are known to influence price action using liquidity to shift the market, trapping less experienced traders in the process. Continuing, pseudonymous trader CW described $86,000 as a “buying wall” provided by whales.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins are feeling the impact of Bitcoin's latest sell-off, with total altcoin market capitalization continuing its downward trend. Bitcoin's slide below $85,000 has triggered broad weakness across major altcoins, with market data showing losses extending beyond BTC into the broader market. Ethereum traded around $2,818, down 6.38% on the day, while BNB slipped 4.06% to roughly $865. Volume data suggests the moves were not isolated. At the same time, Solana exceeded $6 billion, indicating that selling pressure was broadly distributed rather than confined to thin liquidity conditions. Total altcoin market capitalization declined to around $1.18 trillion, continuing a downtrend that has been in place since early December. While short-lived rebounds appeared earlier in the month, the broader trajectory shows lower highs and lower lows, pointing to sustained capital outflows rather than temporary volatility. Notably, the data does not show meaningful divergence between large-cap and mid-cap altcoins. The decline appears systemic, with most sectors moving in tandem rather than investors reallocating into select narratives. Despite Bitcoin's pullback, there is limited evidence of a classic rotation into altcoins. The absence of relative strength among major tokens suggests traders are reducing exposure rather than shifting risk within the crypto market. This dynamic aligns with recent derivatives and liquidation data, which showed elevated leverage being unwound earlier in the week. As leverage resets, spot markets have followed with subdued demand and weaker follow-through on rebounds. Unless Bitcoin regains traction above recent breakdown levels, altcoins are likely to remain sensitive to further downside or extended consolidation. Trading, buying or selling cryptocurrencies should be considered a high-risk investment and every reader is advised to do their own research before making any decisions.</p>
