                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Catherine O'Hara, a gifted comedic actress and two-time Emmy winner, has died. She's arguably best known for playing Kevin's (Macaulay Culkin) mother, Kate, in the Home Alone movies and had a career renaissance in the past 10 years with Schitt's Creek — winning an Emmy for her role as a faded soap opera actress opposite old friend Levy — and The Studio, for which she earned an Emmy nomination last year. Nancy Seltzer, Longtime Publicist to Garth Brooks and Sean Connery, Dies at 79 Leonard Kornberg, Longtime Studio Executive and Story Analyst, Dies at 75 She also earned an Emmy for her work on SCTV Network in 1982 and was nominated eight other times for acting and writing awards. O'Hara was born March 4, 1954, and grew up in Toronto. She joined the city's Second City company at age 20, first serving as an understudy to Gilda Radner and moving up to the main cast when Radner left to become part of the original Saturday Night Live ensemble. In 1976, the troupe launched SCTV, a sketch comedy show that originally aired on Canada's Global network. The show's initial cast, all of whom were writers as well, featured a murderer's row of comic talent in Candy, Joe Flaherty, Levy, Andrea Martin, O'Hara, Harold Ramis and Dave Thomas; Moranis joined later in the show's run, as did Martin Short. O'Hara would go on to play the overbearing Delia Deetz in Tim Burton's Beetlejuice (a role she reprised in the 2024 sequel Beetlejuice Beetlejuice) before being cast in 1990's Home Alone, the now holiday classic where she plays Kate McCallister, a mother who races back from a Paris Christmas trip after realizing the family left their 8-year-old son, Kevin (Culkin), behind. She became part of Christopher Guest's regular ensemble in the films Waiting for Guffman (1996), Best in Show (2000), A Mighty Wind (2003) and For Your Consideration (2006). O'Hara earned an Emmy nomination for her supporting role in HBO's 2010 film Temple Grandin. With Schitt's Creek, co-created by Eugene Levy and son Dan, O'Hara won a new generation of fans for her role as Moira, who rails at the formerly wealthy Rose family's diminished circumstances. “There's so many projects that get a ton of attention right at the beginning, maybe before they're even quite ready for it, and then it's kind of downhill attention-wise from there,” O'Hara told The Hollywood Reporter after her 2020 nomination. What turned out to be O'Hara's final series role came in The Studio, Apple TV's Hollywood satire in which she played deposed studio head Patty Leigh, who alternately relishes in and sympathizes with her replacement Matt Remick's (Seth Rogen) struggles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. The news was confirmed to IndieWire by her agents at CAA. She died at her home in Los Angeles on January 30, 2026 after a brief illness. The acclaimed actress was born in Toronto but died in Los Angeles, where she had lived throughout the last few decades of her career. Related Stories ‘The Only Living Pickpocket in New York' Returns the NYC Crime Drama to the Actual City Streets Beth de Araújo's Sundance Hit ‘Josephine' Wins Both Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award — Full List But she's perhaps best known for her roles in Christopher Guest films like “A Mighty Wind” and “Best in Show,” and, of course, the “Home Alone” movies, where she played the frazzled mother to Macaulay Culkin's perennially missing Kevin McAllister. She earned Emmy nominations for “The Last of Us” and “The Studio” and won a primetime Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as hilariously deluded, struggling actress Moira Rose in the Canadian show “Schitt's Creek.” Other credits include a laugh-out-loud funny stint on “Curb Your Enthusiasm” as Bam Bam, plus Martin Scorsese's “After Hours,” Mike Nichols' “Heartburn,” Spike Jonze's “Where the Wild Things Are,” Sam Mendes' “Away We Go,” the animated favorite “Nightmare Before Christmas,” and more. O'Hara collaborated with Christopher Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy four times on the critically acclaimed mockumentary films “Waiting for Guffman,” “Best in Show,” “A Mighty Wind,” and “For Your Consideration.” Her performance in the latter won her the 2007 National Board of Review Award for Supporting Actress. Catherine O'Hara launched her career as a star of “Second City Television,” aka “SCTV,” the Canadian sketch show that also featured Eugene Levy, John Candy, Rick Moranis, and more familiar faces in comedy. Her breakout screen role was as an ice-cream truck driver in Scorsese's “After Hours,” which led to roles like in “Beetlejuice” as the pretentious sculpture-art collector Delia, or in Warren Beatty's “Dick Tracy,” or of course, the “Home Alone” movies. She starred in the 1990 original and in 1992's “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York” as a mother who became the heart of the story, stressing about her son Kevin's whereabouts, but funny on her own terms. Her roles in Guest's films announced her as a big-screen comedic talent to watch, whether in “Best in Show” as middle-class Floridian Mayflower kennel club entrant Cookie Fleck (“this tastes like cafeteria hot-plate food”) or in “For Your Consideration” as Academy Award-bidding actress Marilyn Heck, who doesn't receive a nomination (“I wasn't nominated! She's also side-splittingly hilarious as Bam Bam in Season 7 of HBO's “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” as the mentally disabled sister to Marty Funkhouse (played by late actor Bob Einstein). A role that perhaps would not be assigned today. In that film, she played another stressed-out mother, here to Colin Hanks, who is heading off to college while she's stuck at home in an unfulfilling second marriage. Her panic at Hanks' character beginning to flee the nest is pure comic genius. Her turn as outré onscreen diva Moira Rose in Eugene and Dan Levy's Canadian sitcom “Schitt's Creek” turned her into a star for a new generation. It's hard to think of a more beloved comic screen actress who was still working today. Much like her character in Christopher Guest's film, she couldn't lose.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like many world and business leaders and would-be Orlando vacationers, Queen guitarist Brian May is thinking twice about crossing the pond these days. Amid mounting state violence, threats of immigrant detention, and civilian executions, May tells the Daily Mail that touring the States again has given him pause because “America is a dangerous place at the moment, so you have to take that into account.” Since July, masked state agents have been involved in eight fatalities, including the shooting deaths of Alex Pretti, Renée Good, and Keith Porter earlier this year. Meanwhile, the Trump administration's masked police force has arrested more than 352,000 people, cramming them in inhumane detention centers, before shipping detainees, including children, to countries they've often never been to before. Particularly in cities such as Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Portland, ME, things continue to escalate, and today, they began arresting journalists. “It's very sad because I feel like Queen grew up in America and we love it, but it's not what it was,” May says. “Everyone is thinking twice about going there at the moment.” Since 2009, May and Queen drummer Roger Taylor has toured with singer Adam Lambert under the name Queen + Adam Lambert. They last played America in 2023. May didn't speak to any particular reason why he feels America is becoming a dangerous place, though an increasingly violent secret police force that's hostile to immigrants seems as good a reason as any to avoid a country. He's particularly engaged with animal welfare, and per Stereogum, refused to play Glastonbury Festival because, he claims, its founders “like killing badgers, and they think it's for sport and that's something I cannot support because we've been trying to save these badgers for years.” Recommended for You1The Pitt slows back down for some competency porn2Here's what Sam Mendes' Beatles look like [Updated]3Bridgerton gets its mojo back in season 44Old school horror and new school survivalism clash in I Hate This Place5Jason Statham gives his bargain-bin Bourne some heart in Shelter</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Prolific multi-award-winning actress, writer, and comedian Catherine O'Hara died today at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness,” her agency, Creative Artists Agency, confirmed in a statement to Page Six on Friday. After graduating high school in 1973, O'Hara began working as a waitress at the legendary Second City improv comedy hub in Toronto before landing a spot as Gilda Radner's understudy. She went on to become a main cast member the following year when Radner left “Saturday Night Live.” “Waitressing seemed like a fun way to watch the show for free every night.” O'Hara later served as a founding cast member of “Second City Television” (“SCTV”) in 1976 alongside fellow Canadian comedians and future stars Eugene Levy, John Candy, Martin Short and Rick Moranis. She became a star of the sketch comedy show for her ability to play both comedic and dramatic characters, and the friendships she made with Levy, Candy and the rest of her co-stars would last for decades. “A lot of people come up to me to talk about ‘SCTV' – it is really amazing how long that show has lived on,” she said in 2008. “There have always been amazingly funny people in Canada, and we were just one group.” However, she quit the Lorne Michaels-created sketch comedy after only a few days without ever appearing on air. O'Hara's work on “SCTV Network 90” earned the comedian her first-ever Emmy Award for outstanding writing in a variety or music program in 1982. 38 years later, she would go on to win her second and final competitive Emmy for her role as Moira Rose in “Schitt's Creek.” O'Hara, meanwhile, also led an impressive and successful film career. She made her feature debut in the 1980 film “Double Negative,” alongside “SCTV” co-stars Candy, Levy, and Joe Flaherty.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been an eventful few weeks for HBO/HBO Max with a string of strong releases. Kicking off the current streak was an unlikely breakout, low-key Canadian acquisition Heated Rivalry. The hockey gay romance took America by storm, averaging 9 million U.S. viewers and counting to pace as the #1 acquired scripted series launch in HBO Max history. The medical drama, from ER‘s R. Scott Gemmill, John Wells and Noah Wyle, also recently picked up more trophies at the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Awards, including Best Drama Series at both. Another January launch, HBO's new Game of Thrones prequel series A Knight of The Seven Kingdoms, created by Ira Parker and George R.R. Martin, is averaging over 8 million U.S. cross-platform viewers thus far, pacing as a top 3 series debut globally in platform history behind House of the Dragon (17.2M over the same period) and The Last Of Us. Its companion, Season 4 of Mickey Down and Konrad Kay's Industry is nearing a more modest 1.5 million U.S. cross-platform viewers but it is up year-to-year, with Season 4 outpacing Season 3 by about +40% and lifting global streaming of Season 1 nearly +50% last week to their highest levels ever as audiences continue to discover the series. RELATED: ‘It's Florida, Man' Renewed For Season 3 By HBO What's more, all four series are delivering those viewership levels at very reasonable price tags, a fraction of the $20 million an episode House of the Dragon and other big-scale, high-end dramas reportedly cost. In an interview with Deadline, Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO of HBO and HBO Max Content, addressed the quartet's performance and the status of additional seasons already ordered for The Pitt, AKOTSK and Heated Rivalry while hinting that a Season 5 of Industry may not be far behind. AKOTSK, which is based on Game of Thrones author Martin's three Dunk and Egg novellas (one season per book), is the second GoT prequel to get a series order after House of the Dragon. In the meanwhile, HBO has developed a slew of other offshoots, with a number being rumored to be currently in the works, including a Jon Snow and Arya Stark sequel written by Quoc Dang Tran; an animated Sea Snake project Nine Voyages, with Genndy Tartakovsky said to be attached, as well as 10,000 Ships written by Eboni Booth and Aegon's Conquest penned by Mattson Tomlin. RELATED: Everything We Know About ‘The White Lotus' Season 4 So Far He reflected on HBO's association with Martin, who, in a recent Hollywood Reporter profile confirmed creative friction on House of the Dragon that started during Season 2 and came to a head at a start of Season 3 when the author allegedly temporarily stepped back. Bloys also addressed Condal's comments that Season 4 of HoD, whose third season premieres this summer, will be its last as well as wide speculation that the upcoming final seasons of HBO's The Last of Us and HBO Max's Hacks will also be their last. As for Euphoria, whose third season was a logistical miracle, reassembling a cast of high-priced movie superstars, there may be some hope for more. Bloys also discussed the swift acquisition of Crave's drama Heated Rivalry, created by Jacob Tierney, whose success turned its young stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie into global celebrities overnight and whether HBO would get involved in the show creatively going forward. RELATED: Kidnap Thriller ‘The Chain' Lands Straight-To-Series Order At HBO With Damon Lindelof As Showrunner And yes, Deadline asked Bloys about the proposed Netflix acquisition of Warner Bros. that would bring HBO into the fold of its main rival. DEADLINE: Is the success of The Pitt a lesson that you don't have to spend $20 million an episode to get a big commercially successful and acclaimed show? BLOYS: I don't know if it's a lesson so much as it's the history of television, there is a reason why shows were designed this way. What we were hoping for — and what The Pitt delivered — was more than six or eight weeks of episodes, 15 weeks of weekly engagement, but also, and probably most importantly in this environment, setting up a show that is creatively capable of coming back within a year, and with producers who are able to do that. That obviously used to be the norm, and as an industry, we've gotten away from it as shows have gotten bigger and more complicated: special effects, shooting overseas, and all of the things that make shows bigger and more cinematic, but also more challenging to produce. The idea of getting back to the basics, back to what television was, the people who know how to do that, it's a skill, and John and Scott and Noah know how to do that; John has made some of the best shows with the highest episode counts there are. DEADLINE: The Pitt has been able to replicate the creative strength of its first season in Season 2. BLOYS: I have zero doubts about their ability to keep it going. DEADLINE: Are you excited about the pitch for Season 3? BLOYS: They're only preliminarily talking about ideas. Can we mark our calendars for a January 2027 Season 3 debut? BLOYS (laughs): I don't know the exact date but yes, the idea is to keep it on on an annual basis. One of the big goals in putting a show like this on the air was to be able to bring it back annually, that is an important part of the equation. DEADLINE: Like The Pitt, A Knight of Seven Kingdoms also is delivering strong viewership on a modest budget and a smaller scale than House of Dragon, for example. One of the reasons why medical shows have been a staple of television is it is a unique setup where you spend the majority of your time in one location, and drama walks through your door, three times an episode, somebody dying, somebody in distress. If you think about the novellas, it's a two-hander. It's two unlikely friends and heroes wandering Westeros. I'm not looking to change the way that we make television at all. Our business has always been a portfolio business, which means you can have shows like The Last of Us or House Of the Dragon, and you can also have smaller-scale shows like Somebody Somewhere or The Chair Company, adding things that can come back on an annual basis, like The Pitt, or adding things where the creative lends itself, in Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, I don't want to say an easier production, but something that allows you, on a smaller scale, to produce and come back on an annual basis. Is there a possibility for the show to go beyond three seasons? BLOYS: That would be a conversation with Ira and George. I haven't really gotten into what's possible beyond that, but if he's got more stories, it's certainly something to talk to Ira and George about. Again, it was something that we were trying to — it's not possible for all shows — but it is something that, where it's possible creatively, to get back to that and we'd like to try and do that. DEADLINE: How would you describe HBO's relationship with George R.R. He recently called his relationship with Ryan Condal “abysmal.” BLOYS: Like any good American family, I would prefer that our dysfunction stays behind closed doors. DEADLINE: Do you still have an overall deal with George R.R. Listen, I consider it great to have George as the architect of this world. George is a great partner for us to have. The idea that he is going to agree with every creator or showrunner that is either developing or producing, two artists are not always going to agree. So, some of this comes with the territory. DEADLINE:  How involved was he in Season 3? BLOYS: He definitely took a step back. And I would say he's definitely been focusing on Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. And I will tell you one of the reasons why [head of drama] Frannie [Orsi] and I really thought about the Knight of Seven Kingdoms as an interesting adaptation is, we had always heard and know that it was George's favorite, that was meaningful to us. BTW, I've been thrilled by all three seasons. If you remind yourself of the Rotten Tomato stores of the first two seasons, it's 87%; this has been a very successful show for us. So, again, I will say I'm thrilled with what Ryan has done, he's been a great collaborator with us. DEADLINE: HoD has been renewed for a Season 4, and Ryan has gone on the record that it will be the final season. I don't think HBO has said it officially. DEADLINE: And any plans to have a supersized final season? I don't know where he's landed on the episode count yet. DEADLINE: Since we're talking about endings, I'm going to ask about Hacks and The Last of Us‘ upcoming seasons also being final. DEADLINE: I deliberately did not include Euphoria in the last question. It has been widely expected that Season 3 would be the final chapter but I hear that creator Sam Levinson may have an idea for a potential fourth season. BLOYS: What's happening is Sam is finishing the third season, which I will say he's come up with an incredible way to move all these characters ahead five years, it's really exciting to see. We're just starting to see the cuts, which are great. But in terms of what he wants to do next, we will have a conversation about what he's thinking. But right now, he's focused on finishing three and getting it out. BLOYS: Not something I can even get into. We need to find out what Sam is thinking, what he wants to do creatively either with the show, with his life. I don't know exactly what he wants to do next, so that'll be a conversation with him. But he is in the thick of Season 3 right now. DEADLINE: And a show that has found itself surprisingly in limbo with no renewal yet, IT: Welcome to Derry. What is the rationale; it did so well? BLOYS: Let me say, not in limbo at all. It was a huge success for us. And Andy [Muschietti] and Barbara [Muschietti] are hard at work trying to come up with an idea for a story they'd want to tell for another season. One of the challenges is, there's not a book that you're basing it on, so it's invention. Has he come up with an idea for Season 3 yet? He's talking to [HBO head of comedy] Amy Gravitt about ideas. DEADLINE: What is your assessment of It's Florida, Man? I'll break news with you, we are going to do another season. The Jon Snow-Arya Stark sequel, where is that at? BLOYS: Well, since you're asking, you know what my answer is going to be, is that we don't really talk about development. But, one thing I will say that's interesting. And I do like to remind people that there have been exactly two spinoffs, House of the Dragon, and then The Seven Kingdoms which launched two weeks ago. Sometimes, because of the intense interest in development, I think people get confused and believe that development means something is actually in production. So I just want to be clear about that we've been very, very judicious about shows that we produce. We'll develop a lot because we want to give ourselves the best chance of finding a show that makes sense, but we have not produced all that much. This is not Marvel level, four series a year, or anything like that. So sometimes people confuse development speculation with actual shows being produced. DEADLINE: Can you at least give us a sense how many of the HoD live-action and animated spinoffs that have been in development are still active and whether any of them is close to a green light? BLOYS: I'm not getting into any of that. And that's part of the reason why it makes no sense for us to comment on it, because it does fuel this idea that misinformation, and shows are about to be greenlit, and so we just try to keep a lid on it. I know it all comes from the place of being excited, but we try to be careful about what we actually develop and produce. BLOYS: I do think that A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms was instructive in that it does show that the interest in the Game of Thrones universe is there, whether it is huge set pieces or more intimate character piece. And like I said, from the beginning, George's conception of the Dunk and Egg novellas was on a small scale. So I don't think I would take what would otherwise be a giant show and try to produce it smaller. DEADLINE: George has been listed as co-creator on the two GoT spinoffs to date. Will that continue to be the case going forward? BLOYS: I suspect, because he's been fairly involved in the process. DEADLINE: The success of Heated Rivalry, did it catch you by surprise? DEADLINE: We've got it in Australia, US, Italy, Germany, I think also in Latin America and some other territories, but we picked it up in the US, I wanna say, three weeks before it aired. I think what was happening was, Crave originally was going to take it out in 2027 and then they liked what they were seeing and moved up the airdate. So the sales process was more accelerated. It's rare that you'll see a finished show available three weeks from air. I was able to see all the episodes, and I would say that we had some sense that it would make waves or be something that people talked about, but not the way that [it did], the stardom that these guys have experienced and the conversation around the show has been a really nice story and a fun story to witness and be a part of. DEADLINE: Was it competitive, did you have to bid against other streamers in the US? We made an offer on a Monday. I'm not exactly sure where else Crave was selling this, so I don't know the details of the sales process, but I was just happy that we got in there and got it done. BLOYS (laughs): It's gotta be pretty close. DEADLINE: Do you have to pay more for licensing future seasons in light of the success? BLOYS: Typically, when you make a deal like this, any subsequent seasons are included. So thanks to Crave for producing the show BLOYS: It is a Crave original, so I imagine. DEADLINE: So you have no desire to come in as a co-producer? This is obviously a very successful creative collaboration between Jacob and Crave. I see no reason why we would be involved creatively. And as I said, I'm thrilled to have it on our platform, and I'm very happy to be the licensee in a lot of big markets around the world. So I'm very happy, and I'm excited to see whatever they come up with for Seasons 2 and 3. DEADLINE: So the show will not be HBO-ized? DEADLINE: What can you say about Season 2? Production was supposed to start, I think June or July, but people may try to put a rush on it now, given the success. BLOYS: It is lightning in a bottle, for sure. It is rare for an acquired original to blow up like this. DEADLINE: Compared to the numbers we just mentioned, Industry‘s 1.5 million viewers delivery is modest, but it's 40% up from Season 3. Talk about how HBO can afford to renew shows that it believes in that may not be broad hits. BLOYS: Industry is a really great story. I have to give credit to Jane Tranter, who we developed the show with, she's a producer at Bad Wolf. We started out saying, let's try and produce a very modestly budgeted show. Bad Wolf has studios in Cardiff, Wales, and the idea was to find talent coming out of drama school, something we could shoot mostly in Cardiff. And I'll say, what's nice about the show is everybody involved, Mickey and Konrad, the actors, everybody's profile has grown exactly as you want to see with a show like this. It does prove again that TV makes stars. DEADLINE: You started adding big names with Kit Harington in Season 3, and even more this season, so it is not the same small show anymore. BLOYS: But I will say it is still a very smartly produced show. In other words, the budget isn't some massive thing. DEADLINE: Since Industry seems to be breaking out, can we expect another renewal? BLOYS: You'll have to wait and see. DEADLINE: With all the activity at HBO, we need to acknowledge what is happening in the background. I know you can't say much but how would you imagine HBO adding prestige to Netflix's slate? BLOYS: Well, as you imagine, not a lot I can talk about. Obviously, I read what you write and what other people put out there, so I don't have any inside knowledge about anything, and it's not far enough along that we've had any discussions about what it would look like or anything like that. So it's not something I can comment on because I don't know a lot about it. DEADLINE: And last but not least, have you narrowed down the premiere window for the Harry Potter series? And now you're going to ask, does that mean January, February, March, April, that we're not ready to say. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IT: Welcome to Derry has been a ratings standout for HBO, hitting multiple series highs, culminating with 6.5M U.S. viewers across HBO and HBO Max for the finale within the first three days of availability. And yet, more than a month later, the Stephen King adaptation executive produced by Andy Muschietti and Barbara Muschietti is yet to be renewed for a second season. As part of a wide-ranging interview, Deadline asked Casey Bloys why Welcome to Derry has found itself surprisingly in limbo with no renewal after it did so well. “Let me say, not in limbo at all. It was a huge success for us,” he said. “Andy and Barbara are hard at work trying to come up with an idea for a story they'd want to tell for another season. One of the challenges is, there's not a book that you're basing it on, so it's invention. RELATED: ‘Harry Potter' Series Gets Premiere Window On HBO Andy Muschietti told Deadline in December that he is hoping to do a three-season arc. He revealed that he intends for Season 2 to go backward in time to 1935, 27 years before the first season to bring audiences along for yet another of IT's murderous cycle. The finale also gives a big hint as to why this story is being told backward. The series is executive produced by Andy Muschietti and Barbara Muschietti through their Double Dream production company alongside Jason Fuchs and Brad Caleb Kane, who also serve as co-showrunners.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After telling Rolling Stone last year that Queen were in discussions about performing at the Sphere in Las Vegas, guitarist Brian May has now ruled out any American concerts for the foreseeable future. Everyone is thinking twice about going there at the moment.” Last year, during a Rolling Stone interview for the 50th anniversary of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” May had been effusive about the prospects of a Vegas residency. I sat there watching the Eagles, thinking, ‘We should do this. The stuff that we could bring to this would be stupendous.' May suffered a minor stroke in 2024, but he's returned to the stage, including a Coachella performance with Benson Boone last year. Previously, Queen repeatedly demanded that President Donald stop using “We Will Rock You” and “We Are the Champions” at campaign events — efforts a band spokesperson described in 2020 as an “uphill battle.” ‘Chaos': Behind the Scenes of Amazon's Melania Trump Doc Mötley Crüe Prevails in Bitter Legal War With Founding Guitarist Mick Mars “I wouldn't do Glastonbury next year because of the politics of the people who run it,” he said, “Unless that changes, I won't do it.” “There are a couple of things you haven't heard… I don't know when Queen will be back on stage — it's an unknown.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first look at the fab four in Sam Mendes' Beatles biopics has arrived—in the mail. Yesterday (January 29), the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, which was co-founded by Paul McCartney, sent out postcards with photos of Paul Mescal, Barry Keoghan, Harris Dickinson, and Joseph Quinn as their respective characters. Mescal plays McCartney, Keoghan plays Ringo Starr, Dickinson plays John Lennon, and Quinn plays George Harrison. See the cast below. All four of Mendes' films—the first scripted movies to be granted the Beatles' life and music rights—are currently set to be released on April 7, 2028, according to Variety. The Beatles – A Four-Film Cinematic Event also stars Saoirse Ronan as Linda McCartney, Mia McKenna-Bruce as Maureen Starkey Tigrett, Anna Sawai as Yoko Ono, Aimee Lou Wood as Pattie Boyd, James Norton as Brian Epstein, and Harry Lloyd as George Martin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first-look photos from Sam Mendes' films were released around the band's hometown of Liverpool earlier this week — here they are in hi-res. The first high-res images of Paul Mescal, Harris Dickinson, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan in character as the Beatles have arrived. The photos of the Hollywood stars were first printed out by Sony on four different postcards and dispersed throughout Liverpool's Institute of Performing Arts, as well as in Hamburg, New York City and Tokyo, on Thursday. 'Home' Director Takes Us Inside the Migration Experience Through the Eyes of a Young Girl - With Help From Trine Dyrholm and Claes Bang Sam Mendes‘ The Beatles – A Four-Film Cinematic Event is currently set to premiere in theaters April 2028, with each movie following a different member of the biggest-selling music act of all time. The Liverpudlian band first skyrocketed to fame in 1963 and would break hundreds of industry records before their official breakup in 1970. “We're not just making one film about the Beatles — we're making four,” he had told the crowd: “Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply.” Mendes produces alongside Neal Street Productions' Pippa Harris and Julie Pastor. Writing the screenplays are Ford v Ferrari‘s Jez Butterworth, Conclave‘s Peter Straughan and Adolescence‘s Jack Thorne — a trio which should, given their recent award wins, fill the average Beatles fan with hope.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Matthew Allen woke up on Saturday, Jan. 24, he was looking forward to running errands. Now the weekend had arrived, and Allen woke up excited to spend his day shopping for window blinds and dog food with his wife. “I was planning on having a regular day,” he says. But soon after getting up, Allen did what millions of Americans did that Saturday morning: He picked up his phone and found himself staring at footage of federal immigration officers shooting and killing VA nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Allen and his wife changed up their plans, thinking they'd stop by a protest for a little bit before going on with their day. What happened, instead, is that Allen was chased, tackled, sprayed with an acrid substance, and violently detained by federal immigration officers, who, he claims, told him he was being arrested for assaulting a federal officer, a charge he says was baseless. “My name is Matthew James Obadiah Allen,” he screamed while being pinned to the ground, “I have done nothing at all….I'm a United States citizen.” Five days later, Allen thinks back to what was going through his head at that moment. “I'm not going to let you slave-catch me,” he says. This is grabbing someone in the street who has done nothing wrong and killing them, and if that's what we're doing — I've already seen you do it today — that's why any of us are even here right now. Most of us would rather be doing what we love to do on a Saturday morning.” Much of his music, especially on his latest album, Chunkadelic, is about the joy he feels being from his hometown: “Turn to my neighbors, say where you from?” the Rosemount, Minnesota, native sings on “Franklin Ave,” before launching into the prideful chorus: “This my city, this my vibe, this my town.” “So much of what 2020 was, was ‘If this becomes something that is OK for the state to do, they will do it,'” Allen says today. Speaking with Rolling Stone, Allen is ambivalent about the attention he's received for his story of being violently detained last weekend. Allen is not the first musician detained by immigration officials: Marcos Flores, the bassist in Denver-based band Summer of Peril, has been in a Colorado ICE detention facility for more than a month. ‘ICE Out': Protest Songs From Bruce Springsteen, My Morning Jacket, NOFX, and Others Lady Gaga Blasts ICE at Tokyo Concert: ‘My Heart Is Aching' “What happened to me probably won't even be a footnote in what's going on in our state and across the country,” says Allen. After being arrested, Allen was placed in the back of a white pick-up truck (“worst-case scenario” as a Black man, he says) and then driven some distance to an unknown outdoor location in Minneapolis. At that point, Allen says, he was thrown out of the car, at which point he ignored a command to take his clothes off. After some time — he doesn't know how long — Allen, who had been demanding medical attention after being sprayed with a chemical agent in the face, was placed in a stretcher, transferred to an ambulance, and brought to a hospital. By evening, Allen was back at home with his wife. He's banged up, and he's had a hard time sleeping lately, knowing that ICE officials now have his name and could find him at any point. He's since retained a team of attorneys, including Rodney King's civil rights lawyer John Burris, to pursue legal action against the government for their violation of his civil liberties. He's grateful for his Twin Cities neighbors and doesn't regret, for a second, having shown up to protest in the wake of Pretti's death that Saturday morning. “The thing that pays my bills is that my community pays to see me do what I love the most,” he says. It's them — they're the ones who spend five, seven, 10 dollars on my art. So if that's something they're gonna do, I will step up for them.” What he wants those outside Minnesota to understand about the ongoing federal occupation (the government is referring to it as Operation Metro Surge, with a stated purpose of apprehending violent immigrants), is that the conflict between federal agents and the people of Minnesota has not been a fight between two equal sides. “This is a heavily armed people willing to murder versus snowballs and signs….We're human beings saying ‘Stop killing us.' Mötley Crüe Prevails in Bitter Legal War With Founding Guitarist Mick Mars Speaking to Rolling Stone the day before a planned nationwide strike modeled after Minnesota's recent statewide strike (and endorsed by everyone from Ariana Grande to Pedro Pascal), Allen can't help but feel as though his home state has become a microcosm for the nation. And just like there are people in this country who say ‘We don't want people different than us on our streets,' there are thousands and thousands more who still stand in the street and say, ‘Those people are dumb.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tony Romo never made it to a Super Bowl during his 14-year NFL career, but the former Dallas Cowboys star and CBS sports analyst still knows how to throw darts that stick a decade after leaving the game. Take, for instance, his repeated slip-ups during the 2023-2024 NFL season when he accidentally referred to Taylor Swift as Travis Kelce‘s “wife,” more than a year and a half before the couple got engaged. Olivia Dean Beats Harry Styles to ARIA Chart Crown Now, in a new interview with SiriusXM's The Morning Mash Up on Thursday (Jan. 29), Romo, 45, said his mistake was actually no mistake at all. “I did that on purpose and people were like, ‘Do you know something?' I was like, ‘Nah, I just wanted to make you guys think for a second [and] just mess with you a little bit. After Swift began dating Chiefs tight end Kelce in 2023, the world's biggest pop star — then in the midst of her record-setting Eras Tour — became a staple of network coverage of her boyfriend's team, with the camera often cutting to her several times a game to gauge her reaction to Kelce's play or check out which other celebs were joining her in the Kelce family skybox. Kelce and Swift made it official on Aug. 26, 2025 in a widely seen Instagram post in which Taylor wrote, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.” At press time the couple had not yet revealed a date or location for the wedding.

In the bonafide phenomenon that is “Heated Rivalry,” no interview with the stars or series creator Jacob Tierney can escape one question: why women would flock to a series about the turbulent romances of gay hockey players. Truth is: For those of us who consume anime and manga, the breakout success of “Heated Rivalry” isn't a surprising cultural development at all. Related Stories How ‘Ponies' Hides Its Spy Psychology in Plain Sight Through '70s-Tastic Costumes and Sets In the First Half of ‘Bridgerton' Season 4, Benedict Finally Learns About Power Dynamics (and Pulse-Pounding Romance) A niche category with an outsized cultural influence, it's known for its ability to explore and experience sexuality via narrative without a female presence. We've seen this phenomenon in American media before, such as the U.S. adaptation of “Queer as Folk” (2000-2005), which intrigued a majority-female viewership with its chronicles of modern gay male life. Anne Rice's “The Vampire Chronicles” is another example of queer male narratives written by women; look at the online audience discussing its current AMC adaptation and the vast majority of its most avid fans are female. Still, understand how Yaoi treats authorial perspective and queerness and you'll understand what feeds the fandom of “Heated Rivalry.” Boys' Love dates back to 1970 with the publication of “Sunroom Nite.” It spread through self-published fan works (known as dōjinshi) and its popularity grew during the mid-'90s. Like many genres within the Japanese media umbrella, it refers to both its target audience and its subject matter. Traditionally, BL are romance and love stories between men that are written primarily by women and have a core audience of female readers. Questions of authorial identity, and whether it's appropriate for a queer story to be told by straight writers, are murky and controversial; it feeds much of the criticism surrounding epic best seller “A Little Life” by Hanya Yanagihara. A frequent trope in these romances is the men in love don't identify as gay; often these are the only men for whom they've ever had romantic feelings. Sex scenes in these manga are often mocked for their unrealistic positions and content; there's an entire Wikipedia page for the fan term “yaoi hole.” However, the defining cliché of Japanese BL is the Seme and the Uke, character archetypes that subtextually gender ostensibly same-sex relationships. A typical Seme is older, taller, and more muscular than his romantic interest, and is defined by dominance and sexual aggression (emphasis on aggression: notoriously, many BL love stories begin with rape or otherwise dubious consent that eventually morphs into true love). The Uke is the bottom, and is written in a way that codes him as female: he's shorter, thinner, pretty to the point that he may be androgynous, sexually inexperienced, shy, and emotional in a way that borders on histrionic. It's an extreme heteronormative portrayal of gay relationships where the couple is essentially straight in all but aesthetics. Reading BL as a gay man is generally not about seeing yourself reflected in the story. Scant academic studies echo many of the interviews with Tierney and his cast: For female readers, there's a sense of safety in being removed from the sex and romance they consume; they also enjoy a relationship removed from the power dynamics of gender. Women have limited physical presence in BL media, but they're spiritually represented in the genre's tone, perspective, and who is meant to derive sexual pleasure from its contents. For anyone who wondered why “Heated Rivalry” fans say they're “fujoing out” on Twitter, that's a takeoff of the BL term “fujoshi,” a pejorative roughly translating to “rotten girl” now reclaimed by female fans of queer male-centered works. South Korea, China, and Thailand also have developed their own live-action BL industries. The “Heated Rivalry” universe has its roots in fanfiction, a genre that takes obvious inspiration from BL tropes. Reid's first novel “Game Changer,” which focuses on the characters Scott and Kip, notoriously began life as a fanfiction about Captain America and Bucky Barnes from the MCU and was later retrofitted into an original story. It does not have an explicit fanfiction counterpart, although the characters of Shane and Ilya take broad inspiration from the real-life rivalry between star hockey players Sid Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin. But, more than other books in Reid's series, “Heated Rivalry” and its love story slide neatly into many BL genre conventions. All the same, both men fall neatly into stereotypical Seme and Uke roles that in some ways gender them despite their masculine appearances. While this dynamic does reflect some queer relationships, it also carries connotations of one partner occupying a more “feminine” role — an idea the book's characterization reinforces. Ilya fits the basic character traits of many Seme found in BL stories: Sexually experienced and confident, he pursues Shane while his bad-boy image hides a heart of gold. In the the book, Shane's thin characterization can make him come across as a self-insert for female audience members. A scene late in the novel reads extremely straight: As he watches Ilya play with children, Shane wonders if his lover will want kids. Reid's writing leans into a stark physical dichotomy between the two men: “Rozanov was so… masculine. Uncomfortably, this is also how the novel explores Shane's racial identity. Much of this applies only to the “Heated Rivalry” book; even in “The Long Game” sequel, Reid softens Ilya considerably and complicates the couple's dynamics in ways that largely avoid Seme/Uke characteristics. Casting plays a big role: Hudson Williams (Shane) and Connor Storrie (Ilya) are two men of roughly equal height and build. The writing emphasizes a light dom/sub flavor in their relationship that Reid's book never really identifies — for example, Shane roleplays a bellboy in a forced-seduction fantasy with Ilya in the final episode — and provides texture that considerably levels the relationship's playing field. Shane particularly receives many narrative and performance additions that push him out of the thin Uke stereotype. Williams' active choice to play him as being on the autistic spectrum recontextualizes his shyness and inexperience (Reid said she supports this, but didn't actually write him as such). In the source text, Shane acts like an awkward teen well into his twenties. That's not to say the “Heated Rivalry” show is “elevated” compared to Yaoi; it retains the characteristics of the genre consumers have loved for years, including a dramatic but ultimately sweet romance and sex scenes between men ultimately intended for female pleasure. Just don't call what the show is doing with its female audience new or unexpected — if there's a lesson to learn from manga, it's that women have been “fujoing out” for generations. Season 1 of “Heated Rivalry” is now streaming on HBO Max. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Don Lemon was “taken into custody by federal agents” on Thursday evening, according to his lawyer. The former CNN anchor has been charged with conspiracy to deprive rights and violation of the FACE Act — interfering by force of someone's First Amendment rights — during an anti-ICE protest at Cities Church in St. Paul, Minn., on Jan. 18, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told TMZ. He claimed, “Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Lowell referred to his client's arrest as an “attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration” — and an “unprecedented attack on the First Amendment.” Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, for his part, told Lemon he was “on notice,” claiming on social media that “a house of worship is not a public forum for your protest.” Last week, a magistrate judge approved charges against three individuals — not Lemon — and those people were arrested as of Jan. 22. Lemon's lawyer wrote in a statement that the “magistrate's reported actions confirm the nature of Don's First Amendment protected work this weekend in Minnesota as a reporter.” Lemon himself pointed out to Fox News Digital that he'd been “cast as the face of a protest” despite not being “the only reporter there.” Amid a “barrage of violent threats, along with homophobic and racist slurs,” he insisted, “I stand by my reporting.”</p>

The pop icon signed with Atlantic Records in September and soon after shared news of her upcoming album, luck… or something, out Feb. 20. She has released two singles so far, “Mature” and “Roommates.” In January, Duff embarked on a four-city mini tour including London, Toronto, Brooklyn and Los Angeles. And for her hometown finale, she made sure to save a special surprise. HARDY, Morgan Wallen, Tim McGraw & Eric Church Join Forces for 'McArthur': Stream It Now Halfway through her set — which featured beloved hits including “Why Not,” “Come Clean” and “What Dreams Are Made Of” — Duff invited three lucky fans on stage to dance with her. And after delivering spot-on choreography, she had a thank you gift waiting for each one of them. With their backs turned to the packed venue, Duff gave each fan a black t-shirt and told them not to turn around until her signal. Once they were all ready, the three fans spun to face the audience and revealed major news, with three words spread out across each shirt: “World Tour Loading…” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>
