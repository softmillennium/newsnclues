Historian Greg Grandin discusses the latest developments as Trump also intensifies efforts to topple Cuba's government.

In the aftermath of the abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, Venezuela has agreed to submit a monthly budget to the Trump administration, which will release money from an account funded by oil sales. It's a deal for the interim government led by Delcy Rodriguéz that historian Greg Grandin calls “governing under the blade.” In a further shift away from the nation-building foreign policy of the past several decades of U.S. power, “what the United States is planning for Venezuela is basically to run the country as a vassal state,” he says. “This is an arrangement with transactional details that we've never seen before.”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today's show looking at the Trump administration's tightening grip on Latin America and the aftermath of the abduction of the Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. On Thursday, Venezuela's interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, signed a law that will open Venezuela's oil industry to privatization, reversing a key principle of the Chavista movement that's persevered in Venezuela for more than two decades. This is Delcy Rodríguez speaking from Caracas.

INTERIM PRESIDENT DELCY RODRÍGUEZ: [translated] In this law is President Nicolás Maduro's vision for the future, because there are those who think we pulled this law out of nowhere. No, we had already studied this law, its reform, together with President Maduro. I feel moved to be able to tell him from Caracas, his birthplace: President Maduro, we are delivering for you. We are delivering for the first combatant Cilia Flores. And we are delivering for the people of Venezuela.

AMY GOODMAN: Soon after the legislation was signed, the Trump administration lifted some sanctions on Venezuela to facilitate access to the country's crude oil reserves for U.S. companies to buy, sell and store. President Trump also said Thursday the United States plans on opening up Venezuela's airspace. Trump spoke following a Cabinet meeting yesterday.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I just spoke to the president of Venezuela, informed her that we're going to be opening up all commercial airspace over Venezuela. American citizens will be very shortly able to go to Venezuela, and they'll be safe there. … We have the major oil companies going to Venezuela now, scouting it out and picking their locations.

AMY GOODMAN: This all comes as President Trump Thursday signed an executive order that would impose tariffs on goods from countries that sell or provide oil to Cuba, as Trump intensifies efforts to topple the Cuban government. The move appears to be intended to put pressure on Mexico, which has been an oil lifeline for Cuba as the Island has been devastated by decades of U.S. economic sanctions. Trump said Thursday, quote, “Cuba will not be able to survive,” unquote. Meanwhile, the Financial Times reports Cuba only has about 15 to 20 days left of oil.

For more on this and other issues, we're joined by Greg Grandin, Yale University history professor, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, whose latest book is America, América: A New History of the New World, his recent op-ed in The New York Times headlined “Trump Picked the Right Stage to Act Out His Imperial Ambitions.”

So, we last spoke to you, Professor Grandin, when Maduro and his wife were abducted. They're sitting not far from here in a Brooklyn detention center, expected to be in court, I believe, in March.

GREG GRANDIN: March, yeah.

AMY GOODMAN: But talk about what's happening now. It surprised many when the Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced that Mexico would be cutting off oil supplies, but then she had to clarify her comments. I want to see if we can go to a clip of President Sheinbaum talking about exactly what Mexico would be doing.

PRESIDENT CLAUDIA SHEINBAUM: [translated] It is Mexico's sovereign decision to send humanitarian aid, and Pemex fulfills its obligations under the contract once it ships. I never said it had been suspended. It had not been suspended. That was a later interpretation based on a newspaper article. Therefore, humanitarian aid to Cuba, as to other countries, continues.

AMY GOODMAN: So, it's not exactly clear what she's saying there, that oil for humanitarian reasons would continue. But if you can explain what's happening and the connection between — it's something you've long said — Venezuela and Cuba, especially U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the Cuban American's complete focus?

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, well, just to put it into larger context, I mean, Trump came into power saying, with a kind of buffoonish change of the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and within a year, he had launched this campaign of chaos and murder, in terms of the speedboat operators and pilots, over a hundred dead, and then — you know, and then this fast strike into Venezuela. And he built up a military naval presence in the Caribbean that is still there. It hasn't wound down since the kidnapping of Maduro. So the pressure is still on Venezuela, because Delcy Rodríguez, as Marco Rubio said the other day, is basically governing under the blade. You know, she could be in fear of — you know, he's basically threatened to take her out if they didn't — if they're not happy or satisfied with the level of cooperation that they're showing.

AMY GOODMAN: She's the interim president.

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, she's the interim —

AMY GOODMAN: Yet President Trump already tweeted that he was the interim president.

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, right.

AMY GOODMAN: President Trump himself.

GREG GRANDIN: Right. So, basically, what we're seeing is a kind of new form of imperialism, where Trump is treating these countries like hostile takeovers, where — you know, whether it be Venezuela, whether it be Gaza, whether it be Haiti, whether it be Libya. These are all kinds of — in which these countries go into receivership. And Venezuela really is the most striking example, because it was — it's a big country. In the past, in the 19th century and early 20th century, the United States would take over the customs house of the Dominican Republic or something like that. But what the United States is planning for Venezuela is basically to run the country as a vassal state, basically giving it an allowance, taking its revenues, approving its budget. The money is going to be deposited in some fund in Qatar. This is an arrangement with kind of transactional details that we've never seen before.

And yes, oil is key to it in terms of isolating Cuba — or, oil as a weapon, not oil as profit, oil as a way of isolating Cuba, because Venezuela, in the mind of Marco Rubio and the greater Florida constituency within the Republican coalition, wants the end of the Cuban Revolution. They want regime change in Cuba. And it seems like Trump has openly stated that that's the next goal. And they're putting pressure on Mexico to cut off oil to Cuba, and it seems like Mexico is caving to that pressure. Whatever Claudia Sheinbaum has said, the fact of the matter is that oil, the Mexican oil, has been dropping, has been decreasing, that it's been exporting and transporting to Cuba over the last couple of months. So she's under enormous pressure. And Cuba does have, apparently, a few weeks without oil, and it has very few friends. Brazil is not helping. Carney in Canada, for all of the strong words in his speech at Davos, they're not saying anything about this action in the Western Hemisphere. It's really a — it's really criminal. It's just straight-out criminal activity.

AMY GOODMAN: Why criminal?

GREG GRANDIN: Because it's based on no international law. When the United States says that Venezuela has sanctioned oil, that's just the United States asserting it. It's not — it's not ratified by any international body.

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go to new information, the Trump administration reportedly planning to establish a permanent CIA presence on the ground in Venezuela following the abduction of President Maduro. That's according to CNN, which spoke to several anonymous sources that outlined talks between the State Department and the CIA have weighed short- and long-term schemes to foster U.S. influence in Venezuela. One source told CNN, quote, “State plants the flag, but CIA is really the influence.” CIA officers were in Venezuela in the months leading up to the U.S. military strike targeting Maduro and his wife. The agency covertly installed a small team inside Venezuela in August to surveil Maduro, providing key intelligence for the attack on Caracas earlier this month. One CIA source reportedly operated within the Maduro government.

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, well, we could assume that in the Rodríguez government, the CIA is interpenetrated on all levels. I mean, the CIA has a presence in Latin America. That's not new. Every embassy has CIA staff operating out of the basement office. But this is envisioning an upscaling of the objective, of the mission of the CIA. It's basically turning the CIA into a colonial office, you know, how to run an informal empire.

AMY GOODMAN: Let's go to Secretary of State Marco Rubio Wednesday refusing to rule out further U.S. attacks on Venezuela. His threat came during his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he told lawmakers that Venezuela's interim government has agreed to submit a monthly budget to the Trump administration, which will release money from an account funded by oil sales and initially managed by Qatar.

SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: On the third point of use of force, look, the president never rules out his options as commander-in-chief to protect the national interests of the United States. I can tell you right now with full certainty, we are not postured to, nor do we intend or expect to have to, take any military action in Venezuela at any time. The only military presence you will see in Venezuela is our Marine guards at an embassy.

AMY GOODMAN: Greg Grandin?

GREG GRANDIN: Well, and they haven't drawn down the naval presence. About a 10th of the naval fleet is in the Caribbean, you know, doing — you know, both threatening Mexico, threatening Venezuela and isolating Cuba. So, they have many more ships in the Caribbean than they have in the Persian Gulf going into Iran. Again, this is a new form of — this is some kind of weird hybrid of imperial — informal imperial rule. It's kind of like — it's kind of like the hostile takeovers of nations and turning them — and putting them in receivership, in which the United States takes the power to administer the funds, to run them transactionally, but not take any responsibility.

But the idea of nation building, of course, it's not something that Trump ran on and his base is against. But this really kind of obliterates the idea of national sovereignty and the idea of citizenship. This is turning millions of people, Venezuela's population — but again, it's not just Venezuela — Venezuela, potentially Cuba, Gaza, Libya and so on, into interdependencies, you know, and kind of a new vassal — kind of technovassal imperialism.

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to also ask you — a really, really unusual report. Atlantic magazine recently published an article headlined ”MAGA Thinks Maduro Will Prove Trump Won in 2020.” The article quotes MyPillow founder Mike Lindell saying, quote, “I'm hoping now that Maduro will actually come clean and tell us everything about the machines and how they steal the elections,” unquote. Some have speculated Trump could pardon Maduro in exchange for him stating that Venezuela interfered in the 2020 election, even though no evidence of that exists. And it might also explain why, when the FBI raided the election office this week in Georgia's Fulton County, seeking computers and ballots related to the 2020 election, inexplicably, the head of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who would be dealing with international issues, was there.

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, apparently Tulsi Gabbard is going to be in charge of making the case that the 2020 election was rigged, drawing on all sorts of evidence. And there's long been a conspiracy that the voting machines had — I'm not exactly sure, but there were some Venezuelans that were invested in the company that ran the machines. I don't know the details.

But, I mean, anything could happen. Look, Trump pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug running — he was former president of Honduras — basically as part of a deal to bring the conservative party in Honduras to power, to overthrow the left, and in alliance — if you read — there's a great op-ed in The New York Times yesterday by Jean Guerrero about, basically, the MS-13 — Trump — were acting as election monitors, basically threatening people to vote for the conservative party or be killed.

AMY GOODMAN: Who Trump endorsed.

GREG GRANDIN: Right.

AMY GOODMAN: And again, just to make that point, as Trump says that Maduro is sitting in this Brooklyn jail because he is a narcotrafficker — 

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah.

AMY GOODMAN: — that President Trump pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, who was sentenced to something like 45, 46 years in prison for bringing in 400 tons of drugs into the United States.

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah. So, you could imagine — I mean, who knows? But you could imagine some deal being worked out with Maduro where he makes some statement. I mean, the point is just to flood the zone — right? — to create confusion, to raise the idea that the election was stolen. And this is a way of setting up to discredit whatever comes in the midterms and whatever comes next presidential elections.

AMY GOODMAN: Well, we will continue to talk —

GREG GRANDIN: I mean, but there is one thing: The oil wasn't privatized. I do just want to make this point very quickly. The privatization in Venezuela happened in the 1970s, and the law that was passed yesterday doesn't reverse that. What it does is it moves any kind of arbitration to international courts. It's what oil companies want. It gives oil companies better control over their operations. And it reduces the amount of royalties and taxes that Venezuela would charge on oil. But it doesn't quite privatize. Oil remains considered part of Venezuela's national patrimony, so that will still be a point of contention in future Venezuelan politics.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you for being with us, Greg Grandin, Yale University history professor, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, his latest book, America, América: A New History of the New World. We'll link to your piece in The New York Times, “Trump Picked the Right Stage to Act Out His Imperial Ambitions.”

Coming up, the families of two Trinidadian men are suing the Trump administration for wrongful death. The men were killed by the U.S. in a military strike that the U.S. engaged in, in a boat in the Caribbean. But first up, a premiere of a song by Billy Bragg.

[break]

AMY GOODMAN: That's “City of Heroes,” a tribute to anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis by the British folk singer Billy Bragg, the song written and released in response to the murder of Alex Pretti. In a note accompanying the release, Billy Bragg said, quote, “That these crimes can be committed in broad daylight, on camera and yet no one is held accountable only adds to the injustice.” We'll play more of his song later in the broadcast.

            Catherine O'Hara, the radiant actress whose singular comedic delivery helped elevate movies and TV shows like “Beetlejuice,” “Home Alone” and “Schitt's Creek” to cult classic status, has died. She was 71.
    


            A statement from CAA, the agency which represented O'Hara, said the actress died Friday “at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness.”
    


            O'Hara got her start at Second City in her native Canada, before turning to film.
    


            Her roles in “Beetlejuice” (1988) and “Home Alone” (1990) won wide acclaim. Soon, she turned to collaborating with director Christopher Guest, starring in many of his iconic mockumentaries, including “Waiting for Guffman” (1996) and “Best in Show” (2000).
    


            In those films, O'Hara worked often alongside Eugene Levy, becoming a signature duo who went on to co-star in the acclaimed “Schitt's Creek” together. As wayward posh actress Moira Rose, O'Hara's one-liners were meme gold and earned her critical praise.
    


            O'Hara won an Emmy in 2020 during a Covid-era ceremony that saw stars masked up and celebrating while scattered across the globe, with the action captured on 130 dispatched cameras.
    


            O'Hara thanked creators Eugene and Dan Levy for “bestowing me the opportunity to play a woman of a certain age, my age, who gets to fully be her ridiculous self.”
    


            O'Hara also won a Golden Globe for her performance as Moira Rose in the show in 2021.
    


            O'Hara was known for bringing a full commitment to her roles, with exaggerated voice work and a brilliant comedic sense of timing.
    


            Most recently, she reprised her role as Lydia Deetz for the “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” sequel and played a felled executive in “The Studio,” for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe for best supporting actress in TV this year.
    


            O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch and sons Matthew and Luke.
    


            A private celebration of life will be held by the family, according to her agency.

Lemon's lawyer called his arrest an “attack” on press freedom and a distraction from “crises” the administration faces.

Former CNN host Don Lemon, who is now an independent journalist, was arrested on Thursday over his connection to a protest that occurred inside a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier this month.

The protest was held by demonstrators who alleged that a pastor at the church is the acting field director for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in the city. Three demonstrators have been arrested so far. 

Lemon was arrested by federal authorities in Los Angeles while he was covering the Grammy Awards, his lawyer Abbe Lowell said in a statement.

“Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,” Lowell said, adding:

This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand. Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court.

Lemon is set to appear in federal court in Los Angeles on Friday.

The circumstances under which Lemon was arrested are unclear. The Department of Justice (DOJ) had twice previously sought to arrest the journalist for his reporting on the protest. The first time, a magistrate judge refused to sign off on charges brought by the department; the second, Minnesota Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick J. Schiltz forcefully stated that he wouldn't support the move, either.

“There is no evidence that [Lemon and his producer] engaged in any criminal behavior or conspired to do so,” Schiltz said in his decision. 

Independent journalist Georgia Fort, who is based in Minneapolis, was also arrested on Friday morning for her coverage of the protest. Fort shared details of her arrest as federal agents were knocking outside her door, saying they had a warrant for her arrest based on a grand jury's indictment. 

“This is all stemming from the fact that I filmed a protest as a member of the media,” Fort said in her video. “We are supposed to have our constitutional right, freedom to film, to be a member of the press. [But] I don't feel like I have my First Amendment right as a member of the press because now federal agents are at my door, arresting me for filming the church protest a few weeks ago.”

“It's hard to understand how we have constitutional rights when you can just be arrested for being a member of the press,” Fort added. 

“Agents are at my door right now” In addition to Don Lemon the Trump regime also Arrested Georgia Fort👇🏽 for covering the church protest (where an ICE field director is a pastor)

In response to the arrests, journalist Katie Phang denounced the Trump administration's tactics. “They are coming after those of us in independent media because we speak the truth!” Phang wrote in a Bluesky post. 

Freedom of the Press Foundation Chief of Advocacy Seth Stern also condemned the arrests.

“The government's arrests of journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort are naked attacks on freedom of the press,” Stern said in a statement, noting that “two federal courts flatly rejected prosecuting Lemon because the evidence for these vindictive and unconstitutional charges was insufficient, and Lemon has every right to document news and inform the public.”

Stern added:

These arrests, under bogus legal theories for obviously constitutionally protected reporting, are clear warning shots aimed at other journalists. The unmistakable message is that journalists must tread cautiously because the government is looking for any way to target them. Fort's arrest is meant to instill the same fear in local independent journalists as big names like Lemon.

The organization advised against journalists bowing to pressure from the Trump administration, Stern said.

“The answer to this outrageous attack is not fear or self-censorship. It's an even stronger commitment to journalism, the truth, and the First Amendment,” he said. “If the Trump administration thinks it can bully journalists into submission, it is wrong.”

Some commentators have suggested that Lemon's and Fort's arrests are a “test” of the First Amendment — and that freedom of the press will be weighed against freedom to worship in the federal government's cases against the journalists.

In separate comments sent directly to Truthout, Stern rejected that premise.

“There is a federal law against interference with religious observance, but it requires intent. Journalists don't get to decide where news is going to happen,” Stern said, adding that the intent of the journalists in this instance “clearly was to document important news where it was happening, not to interfere with anyone's right to worship.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Capital punishment taken off table but Mangione will still face federal charges over killing of Brian Thompson

The death penalty is off the table for Luigi Mangione after a New York federal judge dismissed the charges that were eligible for capital punishment in the case accusing him of killing the UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York in December 2024.

In a written court order on Friday, US district judge Margaret Garnett dismissed counts three and four against Mangione, including murder through use of a firearm, which carried a potential death sentence, and a weapons charge.

She said she felt constrained by US supreme court precedents to dismiss the murder charges, saying they were legally “incompatible” with the two stalking charges the defendant still faces.

Mangione, 27, has previously pleaded not guilty to murder, weapons and stalking-related charges in the federal case. He still faces two federal stalking counts.

“This case will proceed to trial on counts one and two, which charge the defendant with causing Brian Thompson's death under two federal stalking laws,” Garnett wrote in the order dated Friday. “The potential maximum punishment for each of those offenses is life in prison without parole.”

“Count three is a capital-eligible offense, on which the government filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty,” Garnett added. “Consequently, the chief practical effect of the legal infirmities of counts three and four, and this court's decision that they must be dismissed, is solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury that will otherwise determine, at trial, whether to convict the defendant for causing Brian Thompson's death.”

Mangione's lawyers had asked the judge in October to dismiss some of the charges in the case, including the only count on which he could be eligible for the death penalty.

Prosecutors have not yet announced if they will appeal Friday's ruling.

In a 39-page decision, Garnett said federal prosecutors could pursue their murder and weapons charges only if the stalking charges qualified as “crimes of violence”.

She said the charges did not qualify because any use of force could be achieved through “reckless”, as opposed to intentional, conduct.

The judge said prosecutors and Mangione agreed that this fell short of the kind of “force” the supreme court required to make out a crime of violence.

Garnett acknowledged the “apparent absurdity” of the legal landscape, saying no one would seriously question that Mangione's alleged conduct – crossing state lines to kill a specific healthcare executive with a handgun equipped with a silencer – was violent criminal conduct.

Separately, Mangione has also pleaded not guilty to murder, weapons and forgery-related charges in Manhattan state court.

He is accused of shooting Thompson dead after approaching him on the street in Manhattan as the executive was attending an event.

On Friday morning, the judge also rejected a defense motion to suppress evidence related to the case, including Mangione's backpack that was recovered from him at the time of arrest, and its contents, including a gun that prosecutors allege Mangione used to kill Thompson.

Mangione's attorneys had argued that Mangione was not immediately apprised of his constitutional rights.

Mangione is due back in court later on Friday morning for a conference in the case. Earlier this month, the judge said that the federal trial is scheduled to start with jury selection on 8 September.

            Scientists have discovered the largest organic molecule containing sulfur — a key ingredient for life — ever identified in interstellar space. The researchers call the discovery a “missing link” in scientists' understanding of the cosmic origins of life's chemistry.
    


            Sulfur is the 10th most abundant element in the universe and a critical component of amino acids, proteins and enzymes on Earth. But while researchers had previously found sulfur-bearing molecules similar to the newly discovered one in comets and meteorites, there was a puzzling lack of large molecules including sulfur in interstellar space — the vast region between stars that is scattered with clouds of dust and gas.
    


            “Sulfur came to Earth from space long, long ago,” said Mitsunori Araki, a scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany and lead author of a study on the discovery, which was published last week in the journal Nature Astronomy.
    


            “However, we have only found a very limited amount of sulfur-bearing molecules in space, which is strange. It should exist in huge amounts, but it's very difficult to find.”
    


            A different team of researchers previously suggested that sulfur might appear to be rare in space because it's trapped in cosmic ice — hiding in plain sight rather than missing.
    


            The new detection, therefore, adds an important piece to this puzzle. “This is the largest sulfur-bearing molecule ever found in space, at 13 atoms,” Araki said. “Before this one, the largest only had nine atoms, but it was already a rare case, because most detected sulfur-bearing molecules only had three, four or five atoms.”
    


            Finding larger molecules is important, he added, because it helps to fill an existing gap between simple chemistry found in space and the more complex building blocks of life that have been discovered in comets and meteorites.
    


            The molecule, which also contains carbon and hydrogen, is called 2,5-cyclohexadiene-1-thione and adds to a growing catalog of over 300 molecules observed in space so far. The finding, Araki said, suggests that many more molecules containing sulfur, perhaps even larger, could be detected in the future.
    


            The molecule was found within a molecular cloud called G+0.693–0.027 about 27,000 light years from Earth, near the center of our galaxy.
    


            Molecular clouds are cold and dense concentrations of dust and gas that allow for the formation of molecules. They act as stellar nurseries as gravity creates clumps that eventually become baby stars.
    


            “A molecular cloud is where star formation is happening,” said Valerio Lattanzi, also a scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics and a coauthor of the study.
    


            Eventually, Lattanzi added, some of these clouds will lead to the formation of planetary systems like our own solar system. “The ingredients that are embedded in the molecular cloud will be transferred to the planets,” he said. “We are trying to find out what the ingredients that will eventually form life are, trying to understand how from simple molecules we get to life as we know it on Earth. And we are trying to add elements to this picture, one by one.”
    


            Researchers first synthesized the molecule by applying an electric discharge to a substance called thiophenol — a foul-smelling liquid containing sulfur, carbon and hydrogen. They then obtained an extremely precise “radio fingerprint” of the molecule that they compared with existing telescope data from the observation of the cloud, collected by the IRAM-30m and the Yebes radio telescopes in Spain.
    


            “We had seen from earlier observation that sulfur molecules were quite abundant in this cloud,” Lattanzi said. “That's why it was a very good target for us. We believe that one of the possible origins of life on Earth is through collisions and impacts of small body systems like comets and meteorites with our planet in the past, that probably brought complex molecules, including ones containing sulfur. So that's what we are trying to do — to connect these missing links in the path to eventually form life as we know it.”
    


            Kate Freeman, Evan Pugh University Professor of Geosciences at Penn State University, called the study “an exciting detective story made possible by powerful radio telescopes and a really good search strategy.”
    


            Meteorites are known to have large and complex sulfur compounds, said Freeman, who was not involved in the research, and they likely delivered many of them to Earth to help set the stage for the chemistry of life.
    


            “Yet, we didn't really know how these compounds ended up in meteorites or their precursor planetary bodies,” she added in an email. “Now we know there is at least a good possibility some of them could be derived from outside the solar system, from molecule-rich regions of our galaxy like the area studied by the authors.”
    


            Sulfur is one of only six elements essential to life on Earth and may have been a critical ingredient in the earliest life on Earth, providing vital fuel to ancient microbes, according to Sara Russell, a professor of planetary sciences at the Natural History Museum in London.
    


            “The presence of complex organic molecules in the centre of our Milky Way implies that biologically important materials may be everywhere in space,” Russell, who did not participate in the study, said in an email. “Finding such molecules such a long way from our home planet also suggests that similar processes may be happening elsewhere — it makes the presence of life existing on another planet that little bit more likely.”
    


            Ryan Fortenberry, an associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Mississippi, said the findings excited him. “Sulfur as an atom exists in a very special place on the periodic table. It has a unique chemistry that allows molecules to do much more than what only oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon would allow,” Fortenberry said via email. “Finding molecules with sulfur in them helps us to better gauge where life could've started, and where it could end up.”
    


            More than 50 years ago it was a miracle to find any molecules in space, added Fortenberry, who was also not part of the study.
    


            “The common thinking was that the harsh environment would simply break them down — now we're finding molecules with 13 atoms and some with multiple dozen atoms,” he said.
    


            “Molecules are more resilient than we gave them credit for, and telescopes have shown us that the chemistry of space is far richer than we could have imagined. I fully expect that we will find amino acids in space beyond our solar system.”

            GOP leaders are still working to resolve complaints in their own party – including last-minute demands from South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham – on a bipartisan funding plan that would stave off another prolonged government shutdown.
    


            And time is running out.
    


            Republican senators are set to huddle midday Friday as Senate Majority Leader John Thune attempts to unite the party behind a White House-endorsed funding deal, all while a midnight deadline draws nearer.
    


            A brief shutdown is virtually guaranteed: Any Senate-passed measure would still need approval from the House, which is not expected to return before Monday. But Thune, Senate Democrats and the White House are scrambling behind the scenes to act on a funding plan that avoids a dramatic weeks-long shutdown like last fall.
    


            “We're still working on a couple of things, but we're getting closer,” Thune said on his way into a conference lunch to discuss funding.
    


            No votes were expected before the midday lunch, leadership sources said. House Republicans will also meet by phone later Friday to discuss whether they can back the emerging deal, according to a source familiar with the plans.
    


            One of those hurdles is Graham, a major Trump ally who is demanding a vote on his own measure to target so-called sanctuary cities, where local officials do not enforce certain federal immigration laws.
    


            He is also threatening to oppose the package because it would void a controversial law that senators had forced into the bill that ended November's historic shutdown. Under that law, senators can sue the Department of Justice for large sums of money if the department fails to notify the Senate when a lawmaker is under investigation and if their personal information is being subpoenaed. Graham himself has made clear he intended to use this provision.
    


            The Republican senator is insisting on a commitment to holding the two votes – one on sanctuary cities as part of the renegotiated DHS funding bill in two weeks and the other on the so-called Arctic Frost provision at some point down the line – in exchange for lifting his hold.
    


            “I've been told the White House doesn't like this, and I told the White House last night, I don't care if you like it or not,” Graham said defiantly from the Senate floor, aware that his opposition was delaying a President Donald Trump-backed deal.
    


            Democrats, meanwhile, are pushing ahead on the funding deal struck Thursday, while publicly and privately fuming about Graham.
    


            “We're working to get it done,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said as he entered the US Capitol Friday when asked where talks stand.
    


            The New York Democrat declined to offer more details about the holdup. But the leadership sources told CNN they are still resolving some issues on the GOP side. They include Graham's demands to keep his ability to sue the Justice Department for major financial sums over the seizure of his phone records – as well as some issues on the Democratic side.
    


            As lawmakers left Capitol Hill late Thursday with a vote not yet secured, Thune expressed hope that senators could act ahead of the midnight funding deadline.
    


            “I hope we can get these issues resolved. Right now, we got snags on both sides, but tomorrow's another day,” the Republican leader told reporters.
    


            But it remains unclear when the Senate may vote Friday.
    


            The current plan — backed by Senate Democrats and the White House — is a funding package comprised of five full-year bills, with a two-week stopgap for the Department of Homeland Security to buy time for further bipartisan negotiations to rein in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Senate GOP leaders do not yet have an agreement among their own conference to bring that funding plan to the floor.
    


            If the package does pass the Senate, it faces multiple obstacles in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson and his team may need help from Democrats to pass the bill.
    


            Schumer, asked if both parties can achieve a real compromise measure on federal immigration enforcement in just two weeks, said, “If the Republicans are cooperative, we can get it done.”
    


            The minority leader earlier this week laid out his caucus' demands for reshaping ICE tactics and protocol in any funding bill for DHS. They include: tightening the use of warrants, ending roving patrols, enforcing a code of conduct comparable to use-of-force policies for state and local law enforcement, and requiring ICE agents to remove their masks and wear body cameras.
    


            Democrats, cognizant of the moment of heightened public scrutiny in the wake two high-profile killings of US citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis, saw those demands as attainable reforms.
    


            Trump called on Congress Thursday to support the package, saying he hoped both parties would “give a very much needed Bipartisan ‘YES' Vote.”
    


            But government agencies are still likely to close their doors at the end of the day on Friday due to a lapse in government funding, as the narrowly divided House has not yet returned from its week-long recess to weigh the deal.

Batch will include more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, deputy attorney general Todd Blanche says

Epstein files release – latest updates

The US deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said on Friday that the justice department had released more than 3m pages of documents related to its investigation into the disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in a long-awaited announcement that appears to represent the bulk of the so-called Epstein files that have dogged Donald Trump politically.

In a testy news conference, Blanche said that the release would include more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, which will have “extensive redactions”. He added that the Trump administration had produced roughly 3.5m pages in an effort to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act. He said that they include large quantities of commercial pornography and images “that were seized from Epstein's devices”.

“The department's collection effort resulted in more than 6m pages being identified as potentially responsive, including Department and FBI emails, interview summaries, images, videos and various other materials collected and generated during the various investigations and prosecutions that the act covered,” Blanche said.

A large tranche of documents became available on the Department of Justice website during the news conference.

Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to release the Epstein files, but after taking office, he spent months downplaying the files' significance and at times lashing out at Republicans who demanded their release.

The files became Trump's “worst issue by far”, according to the CNN analyst Harry Enten, who noted that while 87% of Republicans approved of his overall job performance in a September NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, only 45% approved of his handling of the Epstein files.

Under mounting pressure from both parties, Trump abruptly reversed course in November, signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act while dismissing the controversy as a “Democrat hoax”.

A letter from the Department of Justice to Congress on Friday explained that the documents were drawn from primary sources spanning over 20 years, including the Florida and New York cases against Epstein, the Ghislaine Maxwell prosecution, investigations into Epstein's death, and multiple FBI investigations. The department has also filed court motions to release additional materials currently covered by protective orders from a civil lawsuit and grand jury materials from a case against corrections officers who worked where Epstein died.

Blanche said that what was withheld were personal and medical files, documents depicting death, physical abuse and injury, as well as any depiction of child sexual abuse “that would jeopardize an active federal investigation”. He shared that the department will submit to the House and Senate judiciary committees a report listing “all categories of records released and withheld”.

Approximately 200,000 pages were redacted or withheld based on various legal privileges including attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine, according to the letter to Congress.

When asked if there were new names in the document drop, Blanche said he did not have anything to share.

He did say that the release reiterated what “President Trump has said for years …which is detailing his relationship, and lack thereof, with Mr Epstein, and what he thought about Mr Epstein.”

The justice department also established an email inbox for victims to report redaction concerns and will allow members of Congress to view unredacted portions under confidentiality agreements. Democratic congressman Ro Khanna, who co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act to secure their official release, said the redactions are potentially suspicious.

“The DoJ said it identified over 6m potentially responsive pages but is releasing only about 3.5m after review and redactions,” Khanna said in a statement. “I will be reviewing closely to see if they release what I've been pushing for: the FBI 302 victim interview statements, a draft indictment and prosecution memorandum prepared during the 2007 Florida investigation, and hundreds of thousands of emails and files from Epstein's computers.”

Just ahead of the files being released to the public, Blanche told Fox News Digital that “in none of these communications, even when doing his best to disparage President Trump, did Epstein suggest President Trump had done anything criminal or had any inappropriate contact with any of his victims”. Later in his press conference, the deputy attorney general said he wanted to dispel rumors about Trump and the justice department working hand-in-hand on Epstein.

“What we told our reviewers, is that that was the goal … there's this mantra out there that, oh, you know, the Department of Justice is supposed to protect Donald J Trump, and that's what we were telling that's not true,” Blanche told reporters. “That was never the case. We are always concerned about the victims.”

The huge document dump follows weeks of delay after the department conceded in a 5 January letter that only 12,285 documents totaling 125,575 pages had been published to date, falling far short of a 19 December deadline mandated by the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The attorney general, Pam Bondi, in the letter, wrote that “more than 2 million documents potentially responsive to the Act” were under various phases of review at the time.

Documents released in prior batches under the act have detailed systemic failures by law enforcement officials to stop Epstein's abuse and included graphic testimony about the recruitment methods used to ensnare victims.

Earlier disclosures under the act included grand jury testimony describing how Maxwell allegedly asked one victim to recruit other girls, telling her “they have to look young at least”, though the victim refused, saying she “didn't want anyone else to go through that”.

Meanwhile, bills requiring students to watch “fetal development” videos advance in Florida and Wisconsin.

Even though many legislative sessions only just convened across the country this month, efforts to restrict access to abortion pills are in full swing, particularly in states that already ban abortion. 

Nearly 200 anti-abortion bills have been introduced in 29 states, according to an estimate by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization. 

“In 2026, medication abortion remains one of the central battlegrounds in the fight over reproductive autonomy, with policymakers in several states pushing bills that would criminalize patients, restrict telehealth and mailing, and even misclassify abortion pills as controlled substances or environmental hazards,” Kimya Forouzan, Guttmacher's principal policy adviser for state issues, said in a statement. 

Some measures targeting abortion medication, including proposals in Arizona and Missouri, have not moved past introduction or beyond referral to initial committees. But lawmakers in Republican strongholds like Indiana and South Carolina have advanced bills that would allow residents to sue providers and manufacturers of mifepristone and misoprostol, key abortion drugs, for sending abortion pills into the state. 

Those efforts echo laws passed in Texas and Louisiana that come with $100,000 payouts if plaintiffs are successful in court. Leaders in states that ban abortions have been clear that the intent behind these measures is to thwart the availability of abortion drugs, States Newsroom reported. 

Our reproductive rights reporting team will be tracking abortion-related bills through biweekly roundups as sessions continue this winter and into the spring. Depending on the partisan makeup of a state's legislature and other state government officials, some bills have a higher chance of passing and becoming law than others.

Senate Bill 236: The proposal would allow Indiana residents to sue anyone — providers, manufacturers and distributors — involved in sending abortion medication into the state and let plaintiffs collect at least $100,000 if a claim proves successful in court. If a claimant cannot identify the manufacturer of the abortion drug, that person can sue all abortion drugmakers by pursuing wrongful death or injury claims for fetuses and pregnant people, Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. 

The law would carry a 20-year statute of limitations. Women who took abortion pills and mail carriers could not be sued, and the use of the medication in other scenarios, such as miscarriage, would be permitted under the law. The bill also empowers the state's attorney general to pursue litigation for violating the legislation. 

Other abortion-related provisions in the bill include legally redefining abortion — treatment for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies would no longer be considered abortion procedures. The measure would require providers to submit to the state health department information about the age, race, sex and location of patients who sought care after abortions.

Tina and Milo, the ermine and stoat mascots of this year's Olympic Games in Italy, are already everywhere — smiling on stuffed animals, posters, mugs and T-shirts.

However, it is another story for their real-life counterparts — living out of sight and under pressure in the Alps as their snow cover slowly melts away due to climate change.

Ermines and stoats are the same animal, but with the ermine sporting its white winter coat and the stoat its brown one for summer. While they might be the face of the Olympics, they are disappearing in Italy's Alps, according to the country's only dedicated ermine researcher.

Since 2022, University of Turin doctoral student Marco Granata has been single-handedly monitoring the sinewy, hard-to-spot mammals who inhabit the same mountain peaks where the games would take place, high in the snowy Alps where their winter coats camouflage them from predators.

“The ermine is like a wild ghost. It's a small, elusive animal,” Granata said. “What makes it so interesting to me is the fact that it risks disappearing from entire mountains.” 

The small mammal's ability to molt — its brown coat turning to white in November — is what Granata calls a “super power” that has allowed it to survive for thousands of years. 

Now, it is a liability.

“The ermine faces a mismatch when it finds itself completely white in a world that should be white, but is no longer so,” Granata said.

Snow cover in the Italian Alps has decreased by half in the past 100 years, a study published in December 2024 showed.

With their camouflage gone, the white ermines now stand out starkly against their mountain backdrop, becoming easy targets for predators such as hawks, owls or foxes.

Another problem awaits when the energetic carnivores climb to higher altitudes in search of snow — a lack of prey.

While ermines are compelled to ascend, the snow voles and mice they depend upon for food have no need to do so.

Ski slopes also encroach on ermine habitat because of “competition for the areas where it snows the most,” Granata said.

His research predicts ermine habitat in the Alps would decrease by 40 percent by 2100, with ermines forced to climb by an average of 200m and the voles staying put. There is little fuss made in Italy over ermines, which were once heavily hunted for their white pelts to adorn royal ceremonial robes. 

Scientists have paid them scant attention in recent decades, given the difficulty of gathering data on the fast-moving creatures.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature last classified the ermine in 2015 as of “least concern” on a list of potentially threatened species. 

That influential list is out of date, said Granata, who hopes his research would lead to their protection.

“The fact that a doctoral student is the expert on a species shows how little attention has actually been paid to this species,” he said.

Every fall, Granata hikes the Alps, placing camera traps — plastic boxes with a motion-triggered camera inside — that help him analyze the animal's seasonal patterns.

“You have to think like an ermine,” he said, placing the box in areas where the curious mammal might go to find food.

When the snow melts, Granata collects the data from inside the boxes and watches a season's worth of videos and photos.

“It's like unwrapping a gift because you don't know what's inside... you actually see this invisible world,” he said.

Fiery accusations of rights abuses and betrayal have circulated for weeks in state-run and social media after a brief conflict in Yemen, where Saudi airstrikes quelled an offensive by UAE-backed separatists. 
The United Arab Emirates is “investing in chaos and supporting secessionists” from Libya to Yemen and the Horn of Africa, Saudi Arabia's al-Ekhbariya TV charged in a report this week. 
Such invective has been unheard of

Relations between the US and its northern neighbor have been rocky since Trump returned to the White House a year ago, with spats over trade and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney decrying a “rupture” in the US-led global order. 
During a visit to Beijing earlier this month, Carney hailed a “new strategic partnership” with China that resulted in a “preliminary, but landmark trade agreement” to reduce tariffs — but

The probe into Zhang Youxia (張又俠), Xi's second-in-command, announced over the weekend, is a “major development,” Perdue said, citing the family connections the vice chair of China's apex military commission has with Xi. 
Chinese authorities said Zhang was being investigated for suspected serious discipline and law violations, without disclosing further details.
“I take him at his word that there's a corruption effort under

Fraud compounds where scammers lure Internet users into fake romantic relationships and cryptocurrency investments have flourished across Southeast Asia, including in Myanmar.
Initially largely targeting Chinese speakers, the criminal groups behind the compounds have expanded operations into multiple languages to steal from victims around the world.

U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to decertify Canadian-made aircraft in the United States could hamper the services of several U.S. airlines and aircraft operators, according to Cirium, an aviation data company.

Mr. Trump made the threat on Thursday night on social media, along with a warning he would slap 50-per-cent import taxes on planes made by Bombardier Inc. BBD-B-T and other domestic manufacturers. He made the declaration in an apparent reaction to the Canadian aviation regulator's move to review changes to U.S.-made Gulfstream business jets.

“Based on the fact that Canada has wrongfully, illegally, and steadfastly refused to certify the Gulfstream 500, 600, 700, and 800 Jets, one of the greatest, most technologically advanced airplanes ever made, we are hereby decertifying their Bombardier Global Expresses, and all aircraft made in Canada, until such time as Gulfstream, a Great American Company, is fully certified,” Mr. Trump wrote.

Where appropriate, aviation authorities certify aircraft for safety reasons, including updates or changes to existing models. Canada is reviewing electronics changes to Gulfstream G700 and G800 models the company made to increase its range and payload, said John Gradek, who teaches aviation leadership at McGill University.

Reuters reported a Trump official said the President did not mean to say Canadian-made aircraft in operation are decertified. Presumably, it would affect new aircraft made in Canada by Airbus SE, Bombardier, De Havilland Aircraft of Canada and helicopter maker Bell Textron Inc., as well as their U.S. customers.

In a statement, Bombardier said it has contacted the Canadian government in response to Mr. Trump's declaration, and emphasized its U.S. footprint.

“Bombardier is an international company that employs more than 3,000 people in the U.S. across 9 major facilities, and creates thousands of U.S. jobs through 2,800 suppliers. Our aircraft, facilities and technicians are fully certified to FAA standards and renowned around the world. We are actively investing in expanding our U.S. operations,” including a new service centre in Fort Wayne, Ind.

Bombardier shares fell by about 6 per cent in early trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Industry Minister Mélanie Joly told CBC the Gulfstream's certification process is under way, and the demands for approvals were made “recently.” 

“We believe that this can be resolved,” Ms. Joly said. “The certification process is something we don't politicize.”

Mr. Gradek said Gulfstream is upset Bombardier is outselling it in the U.S., and unhappy with delays obtaining Canadian certification of recent updates. “This is a trade war between Gulfstream and Bombardier,” he said by phone. Rather than lose the sale battle, Gulfstream pressured Mr. Trump to ban the Bombardier planes from the U.S., he said.

Gulfstream owner General Dynamics GD-N, Bell Textron, De Havilland and the FAA did not immediately respond to e-mailed questions.

Yves-François Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Québécois, called on Mr. Trump to withdraw his threats. 

“This threat undermines economic stability and the entire continent's air transport network on false pretenses, and potentially jeopardizes its security,” Mr. Blanchet said. 

Benoit Poirier, a stock analyst at Desjardins Group, said the matter could be resolved easily. “Both [Gulfstream] aircraft are already certified in the U.S. and EU. Assurances could likely be provided that Canadian certification will follow shortly,” Mr. Poirier said.

According to Cirium, “decertifying” Canadian-made aircraft in the U.S. – normally a responsibility of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration – could affect Delta Airlines, SkyWest, NetJets and others. There are 5,425 aircraft of various types made in Canada in service in the U.S., including 58 Airbus A220s.

Cirium said there are 2,678 Canadian-made Bombardier aircraft registered in the U.S., flown by 1,202 operators. This includes 150 Global Express aircraft in service operated by 115 operators.

Mr. Poirier, in a research note, said the headlines are bad for Bombardier, but the threat is likely empty and unenforceable. 

Still, the U.S. market is key for makers of private and business jets. 

There are about 2,970 Bombardier jets operating the U.S., many of which are owned by large companies, wealthy people and fleet operators. The market is undersupplied, he said, with a two-year wait for new deliveries. 

Tariffs would restrict buyer and traveller choice, while affecting U.S. factories and jobs, he said, given the high U.S. content in Bombardier planes.

California governor files complaint against Medicare head's ‘baseless and racist allegations'

US politics live – latest updates

Gavin Newsom accused the Trump administration official Dr Mehmet Oz of discrimination in a civil rights complaint filed with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator, recently visited Los Angeles and filmed a video alleging that members of the city's Armenian community orchestrated large-scale healthcare fraud. The post set off a days-long public quarrel that culminated in the California governor's announcement.

“My office is filing a civil rights complaint seeking an investigation into Dr Oz's baseless and racist allegations against Armenian Americans in California,” Newsom said.

In the complaint filed with the HHS, Newsom's office argued that Oz's “racially-charged and false public statements” could discourage people in the targeted community from participation in hospice and home-care programs.

The governor's office noted the claims had “already caused real-world harm” by significantly slowing business at an Armenian bakery that is shown in the video.

Oz and the CMS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the complaint or the content of the video, and they have not publicly shared details that confirm the fraud being alleged. But the Trump administration has frequently alleged there is widespread fraud in Medicare, Medicaid and other social service programs in Democratic states.

The conflict began when Oz posted a video online earlier this week in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles pointing to a four-block radius that he said was home to 42 hospices, suggesting potential fraud. He references a business that he says was part of a $16m fraud scheme.

Then, while standing in front of a building that includes an Armenian bakery, he alleges that roughly $3.5bn in hospice and home care fraud has taken place in Los Angeles and “quite a bit of it” was run by “the Russian Armenian mafia”.

Oz, whose parents emigrated to the US from Turkey, describes the Armenian script on the businesses' signs while the camera pans to the bakery.

“You notice the lettering and language behind me is of that dialect,” he says in the video. He also claims there “has not been a lot of attention on these problems” in California.

Newsom disputed the claims in the video and noted on social media that California had revoked more than 280 hospice licenses and banned new licenses starting in 2022 because of concerns about fraud. Then the two leaders exchanged multiple sharp attacks in a back-and-forth on social media.

In one post, Newsom said there were “historic sensitivities”, presumably referencing Oz's Turkish heritage and the history of conflict and violence between the country and Armenia, and said “any and all acts of hate have no place in California”.

In response, Oz said: “If there were a real defense for California's fraud crisis, we'd hear it.”

The feud is one of many that have sprung up between Newsom, seen as a potential Democratic presidential candidate for 2028, and the Republican administration of Trump.

Newsom and the president have clashed over issues ranging from the Trump administration's national guard deployment in Los Angeles to the president's efforts to block California's 2035 ban on new gas-powered cars, a nationwide first.

Oz's video also points to a larger Trump administration effort to spotlight fraud around the country. That effort comes after allegations of fraud involving daycare centers run by Somali Americans in Minneapolis prompted a huge immigration crackdown in the midwestern city, resulting in widespread protests. Two people have been fatally shot in the city by federal agents this month.

Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty for allegedly killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024, a federal district judge ruled Friday, dealing a blow to US prosecutors who were adamant about pursuing the ultimate sentence.
    


            The judge dismissed the murder charge that would have made the 27-year-old eligible for the death penalty in his federal case because it requires that the killing was committed during another “crime of violence.” Prosecutors alleged the other crimes of violence were represented by two stalking charges, arguing Mangione stalked Thompson online and travelled across state lines to carry out the killing.
    


            The judge disagreed, finding the stalking charges did not amount to “crimes of violence” and dismissed two counts in Mangione's federal case – the murder charge and a related firearm offense.
    


            “The analysis contained in the balance of this Opinion may strike the average person – and indeed many lawyers and judges – as tortured and strange, and the result may seem contrary to our intuitions about the criminal law,” Judge Margaret Garnett wrote in her ruling. “But it represents the Court's committed effort to faithfully apply the dictates of the Supreme Court to the charges in this case.”
    


            The ruling is a boon for Mangione and his attorneys, who had made several arguments to avoid the death penalty. And it's sure to galvanize his many supporters, who see Mangione as an avatar for their resentment and anger towards the American health care system.
    


Man arrested on charges of impersonating FBI agent in alleged attempt to free Luigi Mangione



            In court Friday, an assistant US attorney indicated he did not yet know whether the Justice Department would appeal the judge's ruling on the death penalty. Judge Garnett asked for an update by February 27.
    


            Garnett denied as moot the defense's other motions regarding the death penalty. She said the only motion that may still be relevant in a non-capital case is regarding pre-trial publicity. She suggested the defense “table that for now” until prosecutors make a decision on appealing, and then they can renew that motion with a new brief at a later time.
    


            The murder charge was the only count in any of the cases brought against Mangione that could have carried a possible death sentence. He will still face two counts of stalking in the federal case. If convicted, those counts have a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.
    


            Mangione also faces a second-degree murder count and other charges in a separate case in New York state, where the death penalty is unconstitutional. If convicted of the highest charges in the state case, Mangione could face a sentence of 25 years to life.
    


            Mangione also faces counts related to his arrest in a state case in Pennsylvania that are not death penalty eligible. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.
    


US Attorney General Pam Bondi announced she had directed the Justice Department to pursue the death penalty in April 2025, calling the killing “a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.”
    


Jury selection could start in September for Luigi Mangione's federal trial as the death penalty remains a question



            Judge Margaret Garnett also ruled Friday to allow into Mangione's trial evidence recovered from his backpack at the time of his arrest.
    


            Law enforcement seized several items from Mangione's backpack, including a handgun, a loaded magazine and a red notebook – key pieces of evidence that authorities have said tie him to the killing.
    


            The recovered gun is consistent with the firearm used to kill Thompson, federal authorities said in court filings. Some of the handwritten entries in the notebook “express hostility towards the health insurance industry and wealthy executives in particular,” they wrote.
    


            Mangione's attorneys had argued for the evidence to be barred from trial, contending the search of their client's backpack was illegal because they had not yet obtained a warrant and there was no immediate threat to justify a warrantless search.
    


            Federal prosecutors have argued in court filings that officials had a right to go through Mangione's possessions as part of routine arrest procedures and to search for any weapons that could be a safety threat. Prosecutors have also said the evidence should be permitted since it would have inevitably been discovered legally during the course of the investigation.
    


            Jury selection for the federal trial is scheduled to begin on September 8, with opening statements starting on October 13.

Fifteen years ago this month, Tunisian protesters overthrew an authoritarian police state, overcoming brutal repression.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Fifteen years ago this month, a mass movement in Tunisia overthrew the 24-year reign of U.S.-backed despot Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. What seemed impossible merely weeks prior became real.

Today, living in the United States, things feel daunting, hopeless, terrifying: It is hard to imagine how to reverse the intensification of the police state, the erosion of whatever pretenses of democracy this country had, the looming fascism, the open occupation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in our cities, or the kidnapping and execution of our neighbors by masked agents prowling our streets.

Before the fall of President Ben Ali, people in Tunisia faced a situation even more difficult than the conditions that have descended on the U.S. today. For this reason, engaging with the history of the uprising that occurred 15 years ago in Tunisia can be a beckoning whisper in U.S. ears conveying how quickly things can change, how powerful we can be, and how “all that is solid” — to quote Marx and Engels — sometimes “melts into air.”

Life Under Totalitarian Rule in Tunis

Living in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, in the early 2000s, it was clear to me that we were living in an authoritarian police state. While walking to the Sidi El Bahri market near my apartment to do my shopping, I would routinely witness cops randomly rounding up men into vans — this appeared to be a constant occurrence.

As a Western expat I had a degree of immunity from most of the police repression, but the fact that I lived in a populaire (working-class) neighborhood meant that I encountered police checkpoints multiple times a week. At the checkpoints, police would demand my identification, conduct mini interrogations, and generally be a hassle. The omnipresent portrait of Ben Ali observed people going about their days, along with constant surveillance by the state.

In February 2005, after Ben Ali announced that he was inviting Israeli President Ariel Sharon to a technology conference, a wave of crackdowns on potential protest occurred. Leading opposition figures and activists like Mohamed Abou were arrested.

I remember peeking out between the curtains of a friend's apartment on Avenue Habib Bourguiba — Tunis's central road. Through the window I saw rows upon rows of jackbooted cops lining the whole thoroughfare, to ensure there was no protest. A Tunisian friend of mine stepped onto the balcony to take a picture on his phone of the show of force, and within 10 minutes a plainclothes policeman knocked on our door and abducted our friend and confiscated the phone.

The internet mysteriously became especially censored and erratic over those days, and there was a rumor that the police had killed some students at a protest in one of the smaller cities. The police state was a topic as commonplace as the weather — sometimes discussed in hushed, careful, and furtive words, and sometimes alluded to through mocking jokes.

I remember walking home late from a bar in the summer of that year with a Tunisian friend named Walid, who asked to be identified here by first name only due to ongoing concerns for his own safety. An unmarked cop car pulled over, and an officer aggressively grabbed him and demanded his identification, asking him to explain why he was “with these Westerners.” Terrified, Walid yelled to not let them take him because he would “disappear.” I tried to break him free, even cavalierly trying to climb in the back of the truck and insist they take me with him until six more cop cars descended, tossed him in the back of the truck, tossed me into the street and whisked away.

With Walid's brother's help, we got him out of jail the next morning and saw how Walid's wrist was swollen and bruised: the police had hung him from handcuffs in the station while interrogating him. Over breakfast, Walid told me about how he was imprisoned in his teens and tortured for several months with no charge for driving somewhere he was not “supposed” to. His family was given no information on his capture.

He also told me that his earliest memory was of the mass protests against the attempt to lower the bread subsidy in the early 1980s. His neighborhood was an epicenter of the protests, which were met with government tanks in the streets: the army shot demonstrators in the streets. His entire political life had involved contending with totalitarian rule.

The Earth Trembles

Five short years later, everything changed.

“I can't breathe anymore,” Mohamed Bouazizi — a produce seller from the central Tunisian city of Sidi Bouzid — told his cousin one week before he was harassed by police yet again in what was a regular pattern of harassment. And in a story immortalized by the events that followed, Bouazizi set himself on fire in December 2010 in Sidi Bouzid.

In less than a month, the quarter-century reign of a “near perfect” strategic partner of United States imperialism fell, fleeing the country in disgrace. Authoritarianism was swept away with a rapidity that was completely stunning.

After his death, the police could not keep the masses of people off the streets of Avenue Habib Bourguiba — the entire country erupted in protest. What seemed improbable strode bravely into the field of history, singing like the prominent Tunisian singer Emel Mathlouthi that they were “those who are free and never fear” and a “thorn in the throat of the oppressor.” In less than a month, the quarter-century reign of a “near perfect” strategic partner of United States imperialism fell, fleeing the country in disgrace. Authoritarianism was swept away with a rapidity that was completely stunning.

Something was set loose. A dam was broken that had remained solid for decades, not just in Tunisia but also across the Middle East and North Africa. People in the millions saw in a stroke of lightning that fighting was possible, fighting could win, freedom could be grasped, and revolution was an actuality.

This is not to say the events were purely spontaneous — important networks of underground activists in numerous countries and worker organizations like the Tunisian General Labor Union played invaluable roles in trying to harness and organize an energy unleashed. But masses of people learned by doing. We often don't grasp our power or what is possible until we actively are taking part in mass struggle.

As the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin remarked of Russia's revolutionary events of 1905: “Only struggle educates the exploited class. Only struggle discloses to it the magnitude of its own power, widens its horizon, enhances its abilities, clarifies its mind, forges its will.”

The wave of pro-democracy protests, uprisings, and rebellions that took place in the early 2010s — which collectively came to be described in some quarters as “the Arab Spring” — shook not just the region but the world. Over the next year, in every country from Morocco to Iraq, major protests against undemocratic regimes and neoliberal economic conditions changed the political landscape, toppling governments.

The 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, the 32-year rule of Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen, and the 42-year rule of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya were all were brought to an end either by the protests themselves or events related to mass upheaval. In total, 130 combined years of despotic rule were torn down in weeks and months.

In Syria, the despotic rule of Bashar al-Assad held on despite almost toppling, and the situation turned into an armed conflict. In Bahrain, the government almost fell. For a brief moment, Palestinians began marching from Jordan and Lebanon to the dividing lines of the Israeli occupation with raised aspirations as Palestinians in the West Bank kicked off a short-lived protest movement directing slogans of the revolutionary wave at the head of the collaborationist Palestinian Authority.

A “revolutionary process” was taking place. This process was born of local conditions in Southwest Asia and North Africa, but it was also thoroughly internationalized. The communards of Tunis, Cairo, and Homs raised aspirations of other people in struggle across the world, leading to the anti-austerity indignados movement in Spain; the anti-austerity “movement of the squares” in Greece; the Wisconsin Capitol occupation in Madison; and the Occupy movement across the U.S. In Madison I remember signs drawing parallels between the detested Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and the detested Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak who was kicked out by the revolution. And in Chicago I remember leading Occupy protests awkwardly in chants in Arabic marching to the Egyptian consulate in solidarity.

After a series of blowbacks and defeats, the revolutionary process reemerged years later with another wave of uprisings in 2019 in Algeria and Sudan that similarly overthrew entrenched governments. In Iraq and Lebanon, another round of governments toppled, though the states remained intact. It is not hard to argue that just like in 2011, internationally this revolutionary process reverberated into a year of revolt that saw insurgent movements challenge power in Hong Kong, Chile, Colombia, Nicaragua, and Haiti.

Weeks Where Decades Happen

The power of these movements caught nearly everyone off guard. It is a common sentiment of those involved that they were unexpected. I remember an old comrade of mine, an Egyptian revolutionary socialist who would often jokingly recount how he flew back to the U.S. literally days before the revolution in Egypt began, with no awareness that the solid ground was about to split.

Meanwhile, as Tunisia and Egypt were rising up, The Guardian asked a prominent Syrian revolutionary living abroad, Robin Yassin-Kassab, if the revolution was going to come to Syria, and he replied “Of course not.”

The swiftness that mass movements can swing into action can be stunning. And these movements transform how people see themselves, each other, their world, and their ability to act in alchemical ways. Omar Aziz — the Syrian anarchist who died in 2013 as a result of enduring torture and incarceration at the hands of Assad's jailers, and who played an important early role in the Syrian revolution — wrote: “A revolution is an exceptional event that alters the history of society while also transforming each human being.”

Soberly we must reflect on the fact that these high points of struggle have since been tragically beaten back by counterrevolution. New police states are entrenched in Egypt and Tunisia. Sudan's revolution — perhaps the most advanced and organized of them all — has been drowned in a genocidal civil war. Syria finally got rid of Assad, but it has now entered a complicated new situation in which the new reality under the government of Ahmed al-Sharaa still brings repression and sectarianism. The balance sheet is not positive: In the end, the mass uprisings for economic justice and democracy did not win. And a revolution half-made — as the French revolutionary Louis Antoine de Saint-Just is oft quoted as saying — digs its own grave. But people strived, and tried, and glimpsed a world that they could have taken hold of and won.

Is a Tectonic Shift Against U.S. Authoritarianism Possible?

So what of today? Here in the U.S., our society's repression sometimes feels overwhelming. On January 24, 2026, federal agents occupying Minneapolis, Minnesota, executed a nurse named Alex Pretti on the street in full view of a crowd, as he was pinned to the ground by a half-dozen masked goons. On January 7, 2026, a federal agent shot Renee Nicole Good in the face. On September 12, 2025, federal agents killed Silverio Villegas González in Chicago — to much less outrage.

Meanwhile ICE is abducting small children. Federal immigration agents are dragging child care workers away in front of the kids they care for. People are disappeared to other countries, to concentration camps in swamps. Masked paramilitaries prowl our streets, shooting tear gas into residential streets, and shooting rubber bullets and chemical weapons at peaceful protesters.

With chaotic malevolence on the international stage, Donald Trump is now overtly talking about conquering Greenland and abducting presidents of other countries. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is doing its best to try to essentially outlaw trans people, who are told they don't exist. A McCarthyite purge is underway in higher education. History is being erased in an unironically Orwellian fashion.

Despite the tremendously inspiring turnout of everyday people to defend their neighbors against ICE in Chicago, Charlotte, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and elsewhere, the U.S. still stinks of fascism from sea to shining (and warming) sea.

How can we possibly stop this? What we are up against can feel insurmountable. The presence of far right movements connected with the White House is scary; descriptors of ICE and the Border Patrol as “Gestapo” seem apt. The flurry of Trump's attacks and how quickly things have felt to be spinning out of control is dizzying, destabilizing. Many sharp political people I know feel some sense of hopelessness. It haunts me as well. I have argued that all capitalist states should be called police states, but the current iteration of the U.S. police state is intensified, blatant, and unveiled in Trump's fantasy of strongman authoritarianism. Will we have another election? Trump in his erratic ravings has certainly made ominous claims. The Democrats, in their flimsy charade of being a “resistance” have abandoned us all — as they always have. It all seems so bad.

Dwelling for a moment on the anniversary of revolutions that flamed into existence 15 years ago can remind us that police states do fall, and that the force of people, of mass movements, and of uprising, is swift and powerful.

Faced with this dire situation, dwelling for a moment on the anniversary of revolutions that flamed into existence 15 years ago can remind us that police states do fall, and that the force of people, of mass movements, and of uprising, is swift and powerful.

Even in crushingly difficult political environment of suffocating totalitarianism, people filled their lungs, raised their voices, and breathed fire against their oppressors. Voices and arms and feet and labor crumbled the powerful, even if briefly.

As the great historian Howard Zinn wrote: “If we remember those times and places — and there are so many — where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction.”

It is far from certain that we will win liberation, but the possibility of the collective gasp of a people taking a breath before the leap should hearten us.

In more difficult times and places people have done heroic things that they themselves did not expect. If anything, the steadfastness of Palestinians who resist erasure, who refuse to leave, who stand up against all odds and still live and love amid the rubble, should be our compass. We should hold these lessons to our hearts not out of a Panglossian certainty that things will change despite us, but out of a resolve that a new world is possible if we act together.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks.

We can only resist Trump's attacks by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

Carlos Alcaraz will play Novak Djokovic in this year's Australian Open final after the pair navigated two epic semifinals in Melbourne on Friday.
    


            First, Alcaraz beat Alexander Zverev in five sets – 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (4-7), 7-5 – after five hours and 27 minutes on court, but even that long scoreline belies the drama of a semifinal that demanded so much from both players.
    


            The encounter was a breathtaking display of resilience, fitness and skill from both men, with Alcaraz battling through apparent cramp to prove yet again why he's the current world No. 1.
    


            Then, Djokovic upset the odds to beat reigning champion Jannik Sinner in another titanic five-set battle, progressing with a 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 win.
    


            Now that the dust has settled, CNN Sports takes a look at two memorable matches in Melbourne.
    


            After watching the semifinal before them, Sinner and Djokovic seemed intent on trying to produce an equally epic contest.
    


            For Djokovic, aiming to win a record-breaking 25th grand slam victory, it almost feels like the stars are aligning at this year's tournament.
    


            Until today, he's managed to conserve energy given two of his opponents have dropped out through injury during his run to the final.
    


            It was a rollercoaster match against Sinner, with momentum swinging in favor of both men throughout the contest.
    


            But the Serbian seemed to dig deeper at the end to set up a date with history on Sunday.
    


            “I'm lost for words right now, to be honest,” Djokovic said during his on-court interview, before being reminded of quotes he gave last year where he stated it would be “very difficult” to beat Sinner over five sets.
    


            “I wasn't wrong,” Djokovic said with a smile. “I said it would be very difficult – but not impossible. So here we are.”
    


            At 38 years 255 days, Djokovic has also become the oldest man in the Open Era to reach the Australian Open final.
    


            Sinner, meanwhile, will be left ruing multiple missed chances to take the match away from his opponent. The Italian won just 11% of his break point opportunities and actually ended the night winning 12 more points than Djokovic.
    


            “It was good match from both of us. (I) had many chances, couldn't use them, and that's the outcome,” Sinner told reporters afterward.
    


            “Yeah, it hurts for sure.”
    


            Meanwhile, according to the Australian Open, Alcaraz's semifinal against Zverev was the third-longest match in the tournament's history and the longest semifinal ever at Melbourne Park.
    


            “I always say that you have to believe in yourself no matter what,” Alcaraz said afterward.
    


            “I've been in this kind of match before, so I knew what I had to do. I had to put my heart into the match. I think I did it. I fought until the last ball.
    


            “I knew that I was going to have my chances. I was passionate, you know, in the fifth set, but just extremely proud about myself, the way that I felt and the way that I came back.”
    


            Alcaraz was the favorite heading into the semifinal, and the match started as expected as he established a two-set lead.
    


            But the Spaniard began to struggle physically as the match wore on, with the scorching Australian sun seemingly draining the energy out of him. In the third set, Alcaraz suddenly pulled up with what appeared to be an issue with his right thigh. He subsequently called for a medical timeout as he seemed to struggle with cramps, a moment that angered Zverev since cramping isn't considered a valid reason for a timeout under tournament rules.
    


            “I don't want to talk about this right now,” Zverev told reporters after the match. “I think this is one of the best battles there ever was in Australia. It doesn't deserve to be the topic now.”
    


            With tensions running high and Alcaraz struggling, the world No. 3 seized on his opportunity to level the match after winning both a third- and fourth-set tiebreak.
    


            The writing then appeared to be on the wall as Zverev, still looking for his first grand slam title, broke Alcaraz's serve early in the deciding set. Remarkably, though, the 22-year-old still had more to give.
    


            Digging deep and feeding off the energy of the crowd, Alcaraz stepped up another level when his opponent was serving for the match. He subsequently won three games on the bounce to secure his spot in the Australian Open final, falling to the floor in exhaustion after winning match point.
    


            “I was struggling in the middle of the third set. Physically, it was one of the most demanding matches that I have ever played in my short career,” he added.

MOSCOW, January 30. /TASS/. In 2025, Ukrainian armed formations launched more than 130,000 munitions on Russian civilian facilities, an increase of over 40,000 from 2024, Russian Foreign Ministry Ambassador at Large on Kiev's War Crimes Rodion Miroshnik said at a briefing.

Medical personnel and rescue workers are becoming casualties of Kiev's targeted strikes; they are being hunted, the diplomat noted. Meanwhile, the playbook used by certain UN agencies to collect data on the Ukraine conflict resembles an attempt at large-scale manipulation.

TASS has compiled the key statements from the senior Russian diplomat.

The Kiev regime has responded to every new peace initiative to resolve the Ukrainian conflict with increased shelling of Russian territory or new terrorist attacks.

The intensity of attacks and the number of civilian casualties from Ukrainian strikes "have grown exponentially and are directly related to the intensification of the peacekeeping process."

The playbook used by certain UN structures to collect data on the Ukraine conflict raises serious questions and looks more like an attempt at "broad-scale manipulation:" "Eventually, this looks more like attempts to adjust the conditions of the problem to predetermined results."

Those agencies rely on quite a strange playbook to collect the data based solely on reports from one side of the conflict and "ignore reports about killed or wounded civilians in Russian border areas."

"Unfortunately, much of the allegedly unbiased data is pro-Western," the diplomat noted.

Medical personnel and rescue workers are becoming casualties of Kiev's targeted strikes; they are being hunted: "Attack unmanned combat aerial vehicles have become the primary means of attacking medical workers, medical facilities, and ambulances."

Last year, Ukrainian militants, according to the Russian Health Ministry, "struck 56 civilian ambulances." the diplomat said at a briefing. "Over the past year, 50 medical workers have been injured and 10 killed" in such enemy assaults.

Rescuers from the Emergencies Ministry and emergency response personnel who arrive at the sites of destruction from Ukrainian attacks "are no less at risk:" "The Nazis are encroaching on the very possibility of human survival and humane living conditions."

"Over the past 12 months, five rescuers have been killed as a result of shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces, and another 78 sustained injuries of varying degrees of severity," Miroshnik revealed.

The number of injured emergency service personnel has increased by 40%: in total, 77 employees who arrived to restore destroyed infrastructure have fallen victim to deliberate strikes and repeated attacks over the past year. "Eleven repair workers have been killed as a result of militant strikes," the diplomat emphasized.

Last year, Ukrainian armed formations fired "at least 130,627 munitions" on Russian civilian facilities, an increase of over 42,000 from 2024.

Since February 2022, the overall number of attacks on "apartment and school buildings, hospitals and civilian infrastructure has exceeded 350,000."

In 2025, "at least 6,483 civilians" suffered from criminal and terrorist attacks as well as extrajudicial executions carried out by Ukrainian armed groups.

"No fewer than 1,065 Russian civilians were killed" and "at least 5,418 others" were injured as a result of Ukraine's criminal actions in 2025.

At least 293 children suffered from Ukrainian attacks in 2025. "Of these, 22 were killed, and 271 were injured or maimed to varying degrees."

Kiev has taken 12 civilians out of the Kursk Region and is holding them captive in Sumy: "Kiev has been demanding the release of Ukrainian war criminals held prisoner in Russia in exchange for the return of the civilians," Miroshnik concluded.

Uline employee says she can no longer work for people who helped ‘America descend into fascism'

When Laura Wittmann decided this week to submit her resignation from Uline, the giant office supply company owned by two of the biggest donors to Donald Trump's 2024 election and other Maga Republicans, she did not hold back.

“As America descends rapidly into fascism,” Wittmann wrote in a two-page company-wide email sent on Wednesday, “I can no longer work to grow the personal fortunes of people who helped make it so.”

Working for the multibillion-dollar privately held company had become untenable for the 32-year-old Canadian in the aftermath of the recent killing of Renee Good, a mother, and Alex Pretti, a VA nurse, by border patrol agents in Minneapolis, she told the Guardian in an interview.

Wittmann is based in Ontario and worked in customer service for Uline, which is headquartered in Wisconsin, for four and a half years. She was on a leadership track.

In a disclaimer included in the letter, she said her statements about Liz and Dick Uihlein, the company's founders and owners, were based on her own opinion, and that all claims about their political relationships and donations are alleged. She urged people to Google their record.

“The most insidious form of evil is that which hides behind outward decorum, concealing the violence of its intent behind written policy, monetary donations, and old-fashioned principle. It's easy to see the evil of those who are outwardly violent, tactless, and crude, but it's harder to see the evil of the frail old man and his wife, who comes around once a year to rearrange our paintings,” she wrote.

The political activities of the Uihleins, who recently hosted a speech by Vice-President JD Vance in their Allentown, Pennsylvania, facility, are well known.

The couple are ranked as the fourth largest donors in the 2024 election cycle, having donated $139m to Maga Republicans and their political action committees, according to Opensecrets, which tracks money in politics.

Liz Uihlein in particular is known for the pointed letters she includes in the company's thick hundred-pages long catalogues, which she signs. One missive in 2022 criticized workers who were leaving the company after less than two years of employment, given the “precious resources” used to train them.

She called them “nomads” and blamed the Affordable Care Act – which has been gutted in the first year of Donald Trump's second term – for allowing young adults to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26 and “go where the grass looks greener”. She blamed parents who “pay for their kids' phone bill, car insurance and streaming services” who ought instead to “kick them out of the nest so they can learn to fly”. She also blamed stimulus checks, which meant “people didn't get off their couches to work”.

In her resignation, Wittmann referenced the 2022 “nomad” letter, saying she believed it was a sign of the disdain Liz Uihlein felt toward people who elected to leave. Wittmann wrote in her letter that workers should consider their higher-than-average pay not as an act of generosity as it is framed by Uline, but instead an “assurance of compliance”.

She wrote: “I truly believe that the Uihleins and others like them are the biggest threat to global peace, equity, and quality of life. With their money and influence, they could sway politicians against the horrors unfolding in their own backyard” she wrote. Instead they support the people and organizations “committing the horrors”.

Uline declined to comment.

The resignation letter was removed from workers' emails about 40 minutes after it was sent, Wittmann was told by some of her now-former colleagues. A copy of the letter, which was printed by someone who received it before it was deleted, was shared with the Guardian and published on Reddit.

Wittmann's decision to speak her mind was also influenced by a recent trip to the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where she learned more about how few consequences were felt by individuals who committed atrocities in the war and domestically, including in the aftermath of the Kent State massacre, when 28 national guardsmen opened fire on anti-Vietnam protesters and killed four students.

“What has changed since then? Or more importantly, what will ever change if we are too afraid to speak out and accept some personal risk?” she wrote. “This email is the least I can do.”

In her letter, Wittmann included a call for defiance from other Uline employees. “What is happening now in America and across the territories they invade is either by the design or the indifference of people like the Uihleins,” she wrote. “The system will never change if we continue to work under them and allow their kind to succeed. However small or passive a role we might play, Uline employees are all parts in the American imperialist war machine.”

“I've always been interested in social justice,” Wittmann said by phone. She may go back to school, she said, or just take some time to figure it out. She was bolstered by positive feedback she received from former co-workers and also people in Wisconsin, who found her letter on Reddit and reached out to her.

Wittmann also said she received a voicemail from Uline saying they accepted her resignation and that it was effective immediately. Wittmann said she was not expecting to be paid severance, under the circumstances, and said she felt fortunate to be in a position where she could afford to “take a hit”.

The network's editor-in-chief unveiled a curious list of 19 people to be paid contributors across different platforms

A focus on wellness, nutrition, longevity and cosmology, mixed with more than a sprinkling of conservative ideology, appears to represent Bari Weiss's vision to revitalize CBS News, and regain the trust of the network's lost viewers and employees.

Editor-in-chief Weiss on Tuesday unveiled a curious list of 19 individuals – including podcasters, influencers, restaurateurs, climate deniers and a number of other opinionated writers – who will be paid contributors offering their wealth of wisdom and insight that will help CBS become, in her words, “fit for purpose in the 21st century”.

It is unclear in which context, or how often, any of them will appear. But in seeking to carve out a new direction for the troubled network, Weiss, alternately described by observers as a “millennial media maven” or a prolific “hawker of rightwing bile”, has assembled an extraordinary and eye-opening cast.

The network's takeover by David Ellison, a billionaire ally of Donald Trump, and the appointment of Weiss, raised fears that CBS News could pander to the administration. Here is a look at some of the new contributors Weiss has recruited.

A former US marine and Purple Heart turned bestselling New York Times author, Ackerman's military-themed novels reflect his combat service in Iraq and Afghanistan.

He has called for bringing back the US military draft; and has described Donald Trump, a five-time draft dodger who slurred troops of Nato allies, as a “combat leader” who “will figure out how to bring the country together”.

Depending who you talk to, Attia is variously “the internet's favorite doctor”, with a loyal podcast following of millions, or a wellness grifter whose “expertise” in longevity stems from only rudimentary medical training, and is offered to premium members for $19 a month.

The Canadian expounded on his anti-ageing strategies, and buzzwords, in a 2023 Guardian interview on the publication of his bestselling book Outlive.

“Longevity is such a bastardized term. It sort of smells of snake oil and elixirs and, you know, false promises. What I don't think gets enough attention is health span,” he said.

Weiss is taking a deep stride into the “lifestyle space” with De Boer, a seemingly apolitical chef, restaurant owner and, with her husband Luke Sherwin, founder of a company selling hand-crafted classic furniture they bill as “a love letter to the American home”.

De Boer, born in Britain, is the “ultimate multitasker”, according to the Albany Times Union. She owns three restaurants, writes for the New York Times and Vogue, has a thriving recipe-based Substack, is a part-time fashion model, and parents four sons under six.

During a lengthy career as a firebrand conservative political commentator and historian, Glasgow-born Ferguson has railed against “wokeism” in higher education, and argued that US military might deters crimes against humanity.

In 2018, he resigned from a free speech program at Stanford University after leaked emails revealed that he urged Republican students to conduct “opposition research” on a student with progressive views.

A “wellness bro” and neuroscientist with a YouTube channel and podcast followed by more than 13 million people, Huberman extols the benefits of dietary supplements sold through partner companies on his website.

But critics say many of his theories are pseudoscience; and that the jovial, carefully crafted “masculine minimalism” of his podcasts hides a darker personal background, brought to the fore by a viral 2024 New York magazine profile that alleged multiple infidelities and narcissism.

A “young, Black conservative” with a YouTube following of almost a quarter-million, Hughes, 29, opposes diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and has spoken out against reparations for slavery.

His essay casting doubt on some of the key established facts of George Floyd's 2020 murder in Minneapolis by the police officer Derek Chauvin appeared on Weiss's new media Free Press platform in 2024.

A decades-long friend and confidant of Robert F Kennedy Jr, Hyman – who built a lucrative wellness empire built on “functional medicine” – shares the health secretary's promotion of alternative practices, and skepticism of vaccines, certain of which he believes are linked to autism, a long-debunked theory.

According to the New York Times, Hyman's combined businesses, including a podcast, media appearances, numerous books and an online store, brought in $28.8m in revenue in 2023, and his supplement company has 300,000 customers.

A theoretical cosmologist and astrophysicist, Levin explores many of the mysteries of the universe in her avant garde Higher Dimensions Substack. A September post focuses on “the delicate balance of hot bodies that keeps us alive” and offers an alternative explanation for the climate emergency.

“Our current climate crisis is caused by an unstable interplay of hot bodies, each a vibrating quantum system radiating beautifully at a peak color, as though emanating an aura,” she wrote.

As president of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative thinktank, he wrote an obsequious January 2025 analysis for the Economist arguing that the second Trump administration would be considerably more “pragmatic” than the first; and that it would take “a more selective approach to immigration”, an assertion shattered by recent events in Minneapolis and elsewhere.

He is another author previously published on Weiss's Free Press, penning a disparaging essay describing New York's new democratic socialist mayor, Zohran Mamdani, as a “bourgeois bohemian failson”.

U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House in October, 2025.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press

Threats against Canada come in two varieties: manageable and existential.

In the first category are economic threats – challenges that could leave our economy weaker, and us poorer. The most significant today is from the United States. As Prime Minister Mark Carney put it at Davos, the hegemon is weaponizing our formerly mutually beneficial relationship of trade interdependence and economic integration.

Then there are existential threats. For Canada, an external existential threat is something new. Many other countries, in contrast, are used to living with threats to their existence from larger neighbours. For most of human history, it has been the way of the world.

Canadians have not known such a peril, and have not had to imagine one, since the 19th century.

Economic threats are survivable, even if the worst comes to pass. An existential threat, in contrast, is one where if the worst comes to pass, we cease to be. 

The United States is now an existential threat to Canada.

Opinion: Carney's speech makes Canada a threat to Trump

Before I get into that, let's review the American economic threats. However costly they may turn out to be, they will be manageable. 

Some degree of de-integration of the single North American market is a high probability. The process has already begun. There are tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, and U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked why the U.S. buys other manufactured goods such as cars from Canada. He's also mused about doing away with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

If we do not bend the knee, and even if we do, we could pay an economic price. If we do not bend the knee, and even if we do, trade walls could be erected against many exports to the U.S.

This is, I say again, a high-probability threat. But its costs, regardless of the height of the tariff wall, are survivable. 

Last week, Mr. Trump vaguely threatened a 100 per cent tariff on all Canadian exports. It's not about to happen tomorrow, but let's think about the impact such a tariff would have. 

The erection of a wall effectively blocking nearly all exports to the current destination for most of Canadian exports would send our economy into a recession, at least at first.

But Canada can survive a recession. We have one every decade or so. We recover. The country doesn't end.

Carney calls for national unity in face of economic challenges ahead

During long stretches of the 19th and 20th century, Canada and the U.S. had high tariff walls, and hence far less trade. It would be a difficult transition today to move to trading far less with the Americans, or even, in the most extreme and improbable scenario, trading with them not at all. It would tend to make our economy less efficient, which would tend to lower Canadian living standards. 

But a slightly lower average Canadian living standard would not be the end of Canada. Per capita gross domestic product is currently just under $80,000; the country wouldn't cease to exist if the impediment of U.S. trade barriers, the higher costs of more domestic production and the inefficiencies of more trade with partners farther away permanently lowered that figure by a few percentage points.

An economic hit, followed by adjustment, is manageable. It's survivable.

Which brings me to the other kind of threat.

Canada has gone to war many times since Confederation, but at no time was the enemy an existential threat. From the Kaiser to Hitler to the North Korean communists to UN peacekeeping to the Taliban, we sent our young people overseas to fight for our interests, our principles and our friends. Not national survival.

Modern Canadian foreign policy has been unconsciously shaped by the absence of such an external existential threat. Ditto Canadian defence policy. 

Both operated with the knowledge – the certainty – that Washington was an ally. As a result, Canada's military posture, training and procurement have been mostly about fitting into an American-led NATO and NORAD.

The change in Washington is forcing a change in Canadian economic and trade policy, which Mr. Carney has repeatedly articulated. As part of that, there will be more defence spending, with more of the spending on weapons systems made in Canada and in concert with non-American partners. 

What has not been talked about publicly is the orientation of the sights on those weapons. 

Our long-time friend, with whom our military and intelligence services are entwined and embedded, is now our only potential existential threat. Low probability, but infinitely high impact. 

The other threats our military and intelligence services are designed to confront – Russia, China, Islamist terrorism, high seas piracy, whatever – are not existential threats.

The revolution in Washington isn't just economic. It calls for a reorientation of Canadian foreign and defence policy. 

The last time the Americans were a threat to our existence, we were under the protection of the world's mightiest empire. Now, we stand more alone than Greenland.

More on this next week.

Canada's main stock index tumbled over 2% on Friday, hammered by plunging mining shares, ‍as gold slumped ​after U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh - often viewed as hawkish - as the new Federal Reserve chair.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 3.18%, or 1,051.32 points, to 31,964.81 as of 1241 ET. It's on track for its biggest one-day drop since April 25, when Washington's sweeping universal tariff threats roiled global markets.

Prior to today, the TSX was poised for its ninth consecutive monthly advance, its longest streak since 2017.

Trump ‍named former Fed Governor Warsh to succeed ‌Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, giving ⁠a frequent Fed critic a chance to put his idea of monetary policy “regime ​change” into practice.

“He's historically been quite hawkish and cautious about inflation and the Fed's balance sheet, but he's...become more supportive of lower short-term rates,” said Shiraz Ahmed, founder at Sartorial Wealth.

The gold sector fell 7%, with spot gold sliding 6.6% ​after briefly slipping below the $5,000 mark, while the U.S. dollar strengthened after a recent slide.

The selloff, described by analysts as profit-taking, also pressured silver, along with copper and other base metals.

The broader materials index declined 6.2% and was on track for its biggest single-day drop since October 2025

Among ⁠individual stocks, Imperial Oil fell 4.5% after the oil producer's fourth-quarter profit ⁠fell.

Bombardier fell 6.7% after Trump threatened the decertification of its business jets and 50% ‌import tariffs on all aircraft made in Canada, until the country's regulator certified a number of planes produced by its U.S. rival Gulfstream.

The Canadian jet maker's fall dragged the industrials index down 1.7%.

Meanwhile, data showed economic growth stalled in November in Canada as growth in ‌services was offset by weakness in goods-producing industries.

‘A general sense of hawkishness': How market pros are reacting to Warsh as next Fed chair

U.S. stocks fell modestly, with the S&P 500 down 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 440 points, or 0.9%, as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% lower.

The value of the U.S. dollar, meanwhile, climbed but only after swiveling a couple times following Trump's announcement. 

Warsh used to be a governor on the Fed's board, so investors are familiar with him. That could also mean Warsh is familiar with and hopes to continue the institution of the Fed as an independent operator. And while with the Fed, Warsh criticized the central bank's buying of bonds to keep interest rates low.

Some on Wall Street took Warsh's nomination as an encouraging signal for a still-independent Fed.

But Warsh has also recently been critical of the Fed's current chair, Jerome Powell, and has voiced support for lower rates.

“Indeed, Warsh is not the Fed's guy, he is Trump's guy, and has shadowed Trump on monetary policy almost every step of the way since 2009,” according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie Group. “This doesn't necessarily mean that Warsh will push the Fed into rate cuts soon,” but it could indicate he may be quicker to do so when the time comes.

On Wall Street, stocks of metals miners tumbled as the price of gold sank. Silver, which has been on a similar, jaw-dropping tear, fell even more than silver. It dropped 16.4%.

Prices for gold and other precious metals had been surging as investors looked for safer places for their money while weighing a wide range of risks, including a potentially less independent Fed, a U.S. stock market that critics say is expensive, political instability, threats of tariffs and heavy debt loads for governments worldwide.

Friday's drops for metals prices helped send the stock of miner Newmont down 7.9%. Freeport-McMoRan, another miner, dropped 7.2%.

Also weighing on the market was a dip of 0.6% for Apple, even though the iPhone maker reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

Meta Platforms was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 and slid 2.7% to give back some of its big gain from the day before, after it reported a stronger profit than expected.

Helping to limit the market's losses was Tesla, which rose 5.3%. It bounced back after dropping on Thursday despite delivering better profit reports for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.24%. That's where it was late Thursday, but in the overnight and early-morning hours, it had climbed near 4.28% before falling back. A rise in a bond's yield indicates that its price is weakening.

Yields may have felt some upward pressure later in the morning from a report released Friday showing U.S. inflation at the wholesale level was hotter last month than economists expected. That could put additional pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates steady for a while instead of continuing to cut them, as it did late last year.

In stock markets abroad, indexes rose in much of Europe following a mixed performance in Asia.

Stocks rose 1.2% in Jakarta after the CEO of Indonesia's stock market, Imam Rachman, resigned Friday. Stocks had stumbled there in prior days after MSCI, an influential company in the investment industry that creates stock and other indexes, warned about market risks such as a lack of transparency.

Canada's main stock index tumbled over 3% on Friday, hammered by plunging mining shares, ‍as gold slumped ​after U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh - often viewed as hawkish - as the new Federal Reserve chair.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 3.68%, or 1,213.72 points, to 31,802.41 as of 1327 ET. 

It's on track for its biggest one-day drop since April 25, when Washington's sweeping universal tariff threats roiled global markets.

The TSX, as of early afternoon trading, effectively wiped out all of its 2026 gains. It had been on its longest monthly winning streak since 2017.

Trump ‍named former Fed Governor Warsh to succeed ‌Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, giving ⁠a frequent Fed critic a chance to put his idea of monetary policy “regime ​change” into practice.

“He's historically been quite hawkish and cautious about inflation and the Fed's balance sheet, but he's...become more supportive of lower short-term rates,” said Shiraz Ahmed, founder at Sartorial Wealth.

Investors gain some Fed clarity with Warsh choice, but mull rate path

The gold sector fell 12%. Spot ‍gold dropped ​8.9% to $4,915.17 per ounce at 12:30 p.m. ET, after retreating to an intraday low of $4,898.89 earlier. U.S. gold futures for February delivery slipped 7.7% to $4,940.70.

The selloff, described by analysts as profit-taking after their huge rally, also pressured silver, along with copper and other base metals.

A sharp upturn in the U.S. dollar in the wake of Warsh's appointment also exerted pressure on precious metals prices. Commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, so a stronger currency effectively makes metals more expensive to buy on a global basis.

Some on Wall Street took Warsh's nomination as an encouraging signal for a still-independent Fed.

But Warsh has also recently been critical of the Fed's current chair, Jerome Powell, and has voiced support for lower rates.

MOSCOW, January 30. /TASS/. Russia and the UAE held Kremlin talks following recent Ukraine-related negotiations in Abu Dhabi; Denmark intends to expand its military presence in the Baltic; and NATO countries plan to launch a defense bank by 2027. These stories topped Friday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and UAE President Mohammed Al Nahyan were held at the Kremlin. The UAE leader arrived in Moscow four days after the conclusion of trilateral negotiations in Abu Dhabi on the settlement of the conflict in Ukraine and on the eve of a new meeting there between representatives of Russia and Ukraine. Experts told Vedomosti that the Kremlin talks may have focused on coordinating mediation ahead of renewed Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Abu Dhabi, exchanging positions on Iran, Syria, and Gaza to prevent regional escalation, as well as reinforcing the UAE's role as a key economic, energy, and diplomatic partner for Russia.

Ahead of the talks, Al Nahyan met with Russian, Ukrainian, and American negotiators. The continuation of the security group's negotiations is scheduled for February 1, although this time without the participation of the Americans, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.

The bilateral talks between the leaders of Russia and the UAE are primarily focused on the upcoming second meeting of Russian, American, and Ukrainian representatives in Abu Dhabi under the mediation of the Emirati authorities, Kamran Gasanov, a doctor of political science at the University of Salzburg, told Vedomosti. During his dialogue with Putin, Al Nahyan may have been expected to deliver a message from the presidents of the United States or Ukraine and to gauge the Russian side's stance, the political scientist suggested.

The heads of state will undoubtedly exchange information regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict against the backdrop of the negotiations scheduled for February 1 in Abu Dhabi, Ivan Bocharov, program manager at the Russian International Affairs Council, said. Meetings between the leaders of Russia and the UAE have been regular since 2022, and the Emirates are Russia's second most important trade and economic partner in the Middle East after Turkey: by the end of last year, bilateral trade turnover neared $10 bln, the Middle East expert noted. Both countries, he added, work closely together in the fields of energy, logistics, and industrial technologies.

Another important topic of the talks was the situation surrounding Iran in the context of a possible strike on the Islamic Republic, Gasanov believes. Al Nahyan is likely to attempt to persuade the Russian president to act jointly as a mediator to de-escalate the situation, the expert said: "The UAE authorities are not interested in a new regional war, as it could potentially lead to the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway through which Arab states supply energy resources to the global market."

Gasanov also suggested the possibility of joint participation in Syria's economic and military reconstruction, potentially with the involvement of financial resources from Abu Dhabi. On the broader Middle Eastern agenda, the sides are likely to align their positions on the situations surrounding Iran, Syria, and the Gaza Strip, particularly in the context of the emerging "Board of Peace," in which the Emirati authorities hope to play an important role, Bocharov added.

 

The Danish authorities plan to station a missile battery on the island of Bornholm and increase their military contingent there, the Russian Embassy in the kingdom told Izvestia. According to analysts, these plans pose a threat to the Baltic Fleet and to civilian shipping. At the same time, Denmark and 13 other European countries are gradually building a legal framework for actions against tankers in the Baltic Sea. Against this backdrop, discussions are underway about strengthening NATO's military presence in Greenland as well.

"Copenhagen's plans to militarize Bornholm are being implemented consistently. A separate regiment is being formed on the island. Over the next two years, the number of its personnel is set to increase from 200 to 500. An anti-ship missile battery will also be deployed there. Danish Air Force fighter jets are stationed on Bornholm on a regular basis," Russian diplomats noted.

The appearance of anti-ship missiles on the island will pose a threat to the Baltic Fleet and to Russian civilian vessels. The use of such missiles would mean a war between NATO and Russia, which would inevitably become nuclear, with corresponding consequences, Yuri Zverev, Director of the Center for Foreign Regional Studies and Country Studies at the Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, told Izvestia.

"There is a danger of tankers being detained by Denmark and other countries. Retaliatory measures may not be direct, meaning not at sea, but they could be sufficiently painful for the countries engaged in piracy. And I am confident that such measures are already being considered," the expert believes.

At the same time, the strengthening of NATO's military presence in Greenland is also being discussed. "The buildup of the military presence on the territory of Greenland is taking place amid lamentations about the need to counter an alleged Russian threat. Such narratives provoke military and political tension in the Arctic," Russian diplomats stressed.

However, the development of the Northern Sea Route and the growth of cargo traffic, including transit shipments along this route, will proceed in accordance with Russia's own long-term plans and regardless of the situation surrounding Greenland, the diplomatic mission noted.

 

NATO countries will establish a special "Defense, Security, and Resilience Bank" (DSRB) by 2027 to prepare for a potential military conflict with Russia, Izvestia has learned. Leading roles in the institution will be held by representatives of the United Kingdom. The new financial body is intended to help NATO members meet the required level of military spending of 5% of GDP, allowing them to spend more on weapons than their domestic laws would otherwise permit.

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte stated bluntly that Russia is the alliance's main adversary. According to the bloc, a potential military conflict with Russia could occur as early as 2029-2031. Last summer, member states agreed to increase the mandatory minimum level of defense spending from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035.

The bank's full-scale launch is planned for 2027, a source familiar with the matter told Izvestia. Earlier, plans were reported to raise 100 bln pounds sterling ($135.1 bln). The leadership of the DSRB aims to finalize the bank's charter in Q1 of 2026, with the first bond issuance on capital markets expected in Q3 or Q4 of 2026. The organization is currently choosing a headquarters location, with Ottawa and Toronto among the options. Toronto is considered the leading candidate due to Canada's strong financial sector and its relative distance from Europe.

The prominent role of British nationals in this project is no accident. London has taken a particularly tough stance toward Russia and opposes initiatives by France and Italy to restore dialogue with Moscow. Among British elites, the prospect of a near-term military conflict with Russia is widely debated, Richard Balfe, member of the House of Lords of the UK Parliament, told Izvestia.

Unlike Donald Trump, who has stated that US priorities lie in the Western Hemisphere, London is interested in bolstering its influence in Eastern Europe, senior research fellow at the Center for British Studies of the Institute of Europe of the Russian Academy of Sciences Oleg Okhoshin told Izvestia.

 

The White House and members of the US Senate are seeking to reach a deal to extend federal funding in order to avoid a partial shutdown, which could take effect on January 31 if the funds are not approved, CNN reported on January 29, citing sources. According to experts interviewed by Vedomosti, a bipartisan deal is still possible, but likely only after a partial shutdown, with the Trump administration expected to offer temporary funding for the Department of Homeland Security in exchange for keeping the rest of the federal government funded through the end of September.

Republicans led by President Donald Trump, on the one hand, and Democrats, on the other, have been unable to agree on one of the key sticking points: funding for the DHS. The former support extending its funding, while the latter favor freezing it. The reason for this dispute lies in the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which operates under DHS, following incidents in which two US citizens were killed by agency officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in January.

Public outrage over ICE's actions is no longer confined to Minnesota. According to the latest YouGov poll published on January 26, 57% of Americans do not support ICE's work, and 46% favor its abolition. More broadly, the agency's activities have long sparked concern among a significant segment of US society. Against this backdrop, Trump himself continues to face declining approval ratings.

Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, but 60 votes are required to bring the bill to a final vote, where a simple majority of 51 votes or more would be needed for passage. In other words, Republicans must secure support from at least seven Democrats.

A deal between the parties is possible, but they will not make it in time to avoid a shutdown, Vadim Kozlov, head of the Domestic Policy Studies Department at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told Vedomosti. According to him, the Trump administration is prepared to make concessions in order to prolong talks over immigration enforcement. The most acceptable structure for the White House, in Kozlov's view, would be a deal under which funding for all federal agencies is approved through the end of September, while DHS funding is extended for two months, with the option of further extensions.

 

Lukoil, which was unable to sell its foreign assets to the trader Gunvor due to opposition from the US Treasury Department, has reached an agreement to sell them to American company Carlyle. If the deal is approved, Lukoil's business in Kazakhstan will not be included in it, and the discount could reach up to 40%. For Carlyle, the acquisition would provide an opportunity to benefit from the subsequent resale of Lukoil's most liquid foreign assets, Kommersant writes.

Lukoil clarified that the agreement with Carlyle is not exclusive and is subject to a number of conditions, including obtaining clearance from the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Lukoil is also continuing negotiations with other potential buyers.

According to Vladislav Bedrosov, lawyer in the special projects practice at Vegas Lex, the ability to negotiate with other bidders allows Lukoil to explore multiple options and avoid unjustified delays, given OFAC's previous positions. The statement that talks are continuing with other buyers also suggests that Lukoil may still be able to enhance the terms of the deal, Kirill Bakhtin, head of the Russian equity analytics center at BCS World of Investments, told Kommersant.

Dmitry Kasatkin, a partner at Kasatkin Consulting, noted that the deal would give Carlyle control over a portfolio that includes European refineries, logistics, and retail operations. However, he added, the company itself describes its approach as ensuring operational continuity, preserving jobs, and stabilizing the asset base, which is typical of preparing for a subsequent exit. According to the expert, the most likely plan is to stabilize and "clean up" the portfolio before proceeding with a phased divestment. The most liquid assets, Kasatkin added, are minority stakes in major international projects with strong operators, where there are "natural" buyers in the form of partners, while refineries are the most politicized and could potentially be sold under regulatory pressure, possibly at a discount and through complex transaction structures.

Igor Yushkov, expert at the Financial University under the Russian Government, agrees with this scenario, adding that Carlyle's primary objective will be the subsequent resale of Lukoil's foreign business. From a political standpoint, the expert believes it is important for US authorities that an American company profits from the deal, while the question of whether that profit comes from operating the assets or from reselling them is less critical.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on Jan. 30 rejected the Kremlin's proposal for holding talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow but signaled readiness for a meeting in a more appropriate format.

 "I can just as well invite him to Kyiv, let him come. I'm openly inviting him, if he dares," Zelensky said during a briefing with journalists, hinting that Putin is trying to avoid face-to-face talks.

The comments follow Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov's statement that Moscow is prepared to ensure Zelensky's security and working conditions if he comes to Russia to continue discussions on ending the war.

Ukraine previously said it was open to a meeting between Putin and Zelensky to discuss two crucial issues in an ongoing U.S.-led peace process: territorial questions and the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.

However, the Ukrainian president rejected holding talks in either Russia or Belarus, arguing that Moscow is the aggressor in the war, and Minsk its partner.

The two leaders have not held face-to-face talks since the start of the full-scale war, meeting previously during the Normandy format negotiations in 2019. Last year, Putin rejected Zelensky's proposal for talks in Turkey, instead inviting the Ukrainian president to Moscow — an offer Zelensky promptly declined.

"We are serious about the need to end the war. Any real format for a meeting of leaders is suitable," Zelensky said.

The latest round of peace talks among Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. officials took place in Abu Dhabi on Jan. 23-24, with U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff describing the discussions as "very constructive."

The negotiations were scheduled to continue at the same venue on Feb. 1, but Zelensky did not rule out that the next round may be postponed.

"I don't know when the next meeting will be," the president said, saying that the date and location may change due to the "situation with the U.S. and Iran."

Recent days saw renewed tensions in the Middle East as U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly again weighing strikes against Iran following weeks of violent crackdown against anti-regime protests.

Zelensky also commented on the supposed week-long pause in aerial strikes that Trump announced on Jan. 29. 

According to the Ukrainian leader, there was no direct agreement between Kyiv and Moscow on halting strikes against energy facilities, but he pledged that Ukraine is ready to refrain from attacking if Russia does the same.

"I think this is the response that the mediator in these negotiations, namely the United States of America, was expecting," Zelensky added.

Throughout this winter, Russia has escalated its attacks against Ukraine's power grid, causing one of the most serious energy crises during the war and triggering a state of emergency.

A pause in Russian strikes — provided that Ukraine also refrains from attacking Russian oil refineries and tankers — was said to be discussed during the trilateral meeting in Abu Dhabi.

Editor's note: This article has been updated with additional comments from EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.

Estonia is pushing for an EU-wide entry ban on former Russian soldiers who participated in the war against Ukraine, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said on Jan. 29.

 "There cannot be a path from Bucha to Brussels," Tsahkna told reporters in the Belgian capital, adding that he would raise the proposal at a meeting of EU foreign ministers later that day.

Estonia, a NATO member sharing a border with Russia, banned access to the Schengen area for the first 261 Russian fighters earlier in January. Tallinn is now calling for a coordinated approach across the bloc.

"We have close to 1 million combatants in Russia. They're mainly criminals; they are very dangerous people," Tsahkna said.

"We have information that most of them will come to Europe after the war. And Europe is not ready for that."

An undisclosed senior Estonian diplomat told Politico that existing methods for identifying and banning individuals are too slow and dependent on individual countries, which is why Estonia advocates for a more robust approach.

Another European official told the outlet that while Estonia has the right to impose a blanket entry ban, this would be difficult for many other EU countries, which would have to list each fighter and the necessary evidence individually.

When asked by reporters to comment on the proposal, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that "many member states" have voiced their support for an entry-ban.

"It poses a clear security risk to Europe," Kallas said. "This is one of the steps that we need to prepare for." 

Kallas added that the bloc will further consult with EU members to ensure it has a plan for after a ceasefire is reached.

In Russia, soldiers returning home from the front in Ukraine have been linked to spikes in criminality. Over 1,000 people have been reportedly killed or injured by returning combatants over the past four years, with cases of robbery and drug trafficking also on the rise.

Russia has been extensively recruiting convicts for the war in Ukraine, offering pardons in exchange for service at the front.

 Tokyo Has Stepped Up on China—Now It's Washington's Turn 

 Dan Blumenthal, Mike Kuiken, and Randy Schriver

In November, soon after taking office, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi told parliament that a Chinese assault on Taiwan could constitute an existential threat to Japan and could warrant a military response. To China, which sees any commitment to supporting Taiwan as a provocation, these were fighting words. In response, Beijing stepped up military exercises near Japan, halted the imports of Japanese seafood, banned exports of dual-use goods—products that can be used for civilian and military purposes—to Japan, and advised its citizens not to travel there.

Takaichi's comments are all the more worrying for China because Japan is undergoing a profound shift. Over the past four years, Tokyo has prepared itself to counter China's coercive behavior by splurging on its armed forces, protecting its supply chains, and becoming more assertive in its neighborhood.

Washington has welcomed these moves—but its support of Tokyo in light of Beijing's recent pressure campaign has been tepid to nonexistent. That is a mistake. The United States should capitalize on Japan's newfound muscularity by building its Indo-Pacific strategy around a revitalized U.S.-Japanese alliance. The two countries should harmonize their defenses and, along with its regional partners Australia and India, coordinate industrial policy in sensitive sectors. If the United States fails to take advantage of this moment or sees Japan's strength as a reason to pull away from the region, Washington will be in a much worse position to deter China from taking Taiwan or otherwise wreaking havoc in the Indo-Pacific.

Tokyo began recalibrating its role in the world under the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who led Japan in 2006–7 and 2012–20. In response to an increasingly assertive China, which launched frequent incursions in and around Japan's Senkaku Islands (known in China as the Diaoyu Islands), Abe loosened constitutional constraints on Japan's armed forces and began building up Japan's military might. (Previously, Japan subscribed to the idea that it should possess only the minimum amount of force to repel an invasion.) In addition, he promoted the idea of building a free and open Indo-Pacific, which positioned Japan at the center of efforts to prevent the region from falling under hegemonic Chinese influence.

Abe also revitalized the Quad—a diplomatic partnership among Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—to coordinate security, technology, and economic policy. Abe did more than any other leader to encourage the United States and other like-minded countries to take a more assertive stance against an aggrandizing China. He also made clear that Taiwan's security is Japan's security.

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 accelerated Japan's transformation into a modern military power. Then Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warned that “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,” summing up the fear that China might take a page from Russia's playbook and invade its neighbors. That year, Japan committed to doubling its defense spending to two percent of GDP by 2027 and explicitly and unequivocally identified China as its greatest threat. Tokyo also started acquiring counterstrike capabilities to target an adversary's missile launch sites, which, just a few years before, was considered unthinkable for fear of upsetting China and violating a self-imposed restriction on weapons that can be used offensively. No longer would Japan's military, the Japan Self-Defense Forces, remain in a purely defensive crouch.



Today, Tokyo is preparing to put into service hypersonic weapons that can disrupt North Korean and Chinese air and missile defenses, and deploying Tomahawk cruise missiles, Joint Strike Missiles, and domestically upgraded Type 12 surface-to-ship missiles to improve its ability to launch counterstrikes. Tokyo is also investing heavily in space domain awareness—the ability to track satellites and detect threats in orbit—committing $3.5 billion in 2025, up tenfold from 2020. In addition, Japan is hardening its position on its southwest islands, which are close to Taiwan. (One of them, Yonaguni Island, is just 68 miles away.)

Moreover, Japan has been strengthening its regional defense ties to further solidify its position against China. It has helped other countries in the region, including Bangladesh and the Philippines, defend against Chinese incursions. Tokyo, for instance, has provided the Philippines with an air surveillance radar system and 12 of its 18 coast guard vessels. Japan has also loosened its defense export rules so it can more easily share technology with its allies. In 2023, it signed an agreement with Italy and the United Kingdom to jointly produce a fighter jet. And in 2025, Australia announced it would buy 11 Mogami-class stealth frigates from Japan for $6.5 billion—Japan's biggest defense export deal yet.

Equally significant has been Tokyo's investment in collective defense arrangements. Over the past five years, Japan has inked agreements with Australia, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom that expand opportunities for joint training, resource pooling, shared logistics, and reciprocal access to bases. These are the building blocks of a NATO-like system in the Indo-Pacific.

Japan is now more capable today than it has been at any point since the end of World War II. Yet it faces a paradox: the success of its fortification risks encouraging U.S. retrenchment. American policymakers and strategists who advocate foreign policy restraint may argue that with a more capable Japan, the United States can do less in the Indo-Pacific. But the opposite is true.

Japan's new military posture offers the United States a rare gift: a fully committed ally willing to act as the forward anchor of regional collective defense. Washington should meet this moment by strengthening its defense cooperation with Japan. Deterring China will demand an alliance architecture built around combined planning, interoperable forces, and integrated economic security policy. Geography works against U.S. power projection: if the United States were to go to war with China over Taiwan, the logistical strain on U.S. forces would be immense. Washington would need to work with its regional allies to station its troops and equipment close to the action.

The United States and Japan have been collaborating more on defense over the past several years but they need to go further. In 2025, Japan launched its Joint Operations Command, which integrates the three branches of its armed forces. And Washington and Tokyo have begun upgrading U.S. Forces Japan, which oversees American troops in the country, from an administrative body to a joint force headquarters. But the two allies still don't have a body with the operational authority and structure to coordinate U.S. and Japanese forces in a crisis. The United States should place a senior officer in Tokyo—under the authority of the Indo-Pacific combatant commander—to make quick decisions alongside Japan's Joint Operations Command. Over time, the United States and Japan should work toward a truly combined command like U.S. Forces Korea. Otherwise, if U.S. and Japanese troops come up against a common enemy, they will be fighting in parallel, leading to inefficiencies and, potentially, accidents.

The United States and Japan must also integrate their missile defense systems, including fusing sensors between Aegis ships, ground-based interceptors, and space-based early warning systems to create a seamless defensive umbrella across the so-called first island chain, which stretches from Japan to the Philippines and separates China from the Pacific Ocean.

Beyond command and missile defense integration, the United States and Japan need to together produce critical arms on Japanese soil. Today, the United States stations precision-guided munitions, air defense interceptors, and antiship missiles in Japan. That's a good start, but those stocks would quickly run out in the event of a war with China. Washington must leverage Japan's advanced manufacturing base, which already produces Patriot missiles, SM-3 interceptors, and Type 12 missiles, to jointly make SM-6 multimission missiles and AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, which are precise and long-range.

In addition to improving its hard power, Japan has been preparing itself to better withstand Chinese economic coercion. Through its industrial policy, Beijing has come to dominate manufacturing in batteries, drones, and legacy chips, and it exploits its control of chokepoints over the economy, such as its near monopoly over the processing of critical minerals such as gallium to its advantage. Tokyo learned the risks of relying too heavily on China earlier than most. In 2010, after Japan detained a Chinese fishing captain who rammed a Japanese coast guard vessel near the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, Beijing retaliated by cutting off its exports of rare earths. Japanese industry was jolted, and the episode became a case study in China's willingness to weaponize interdependence.

Almost a decade later, Tokyo established the Council for the Promotion of Economic Security, a government body that coordinates defensive economic policy, and passed the Economic Security Promotion Act to ensure stable supplies of critical goods, protect essential infrastructure, develop vital technologies, and safeguard sensitive intellectual property. In particular, Japan has upgraded its domestic chip industry. Tokyo, for instance, allocated $6.9 billion for a plant for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's leading semiconductor manufacturer, in Kyushu. And it has poured over $10 billion into Rapidus, a chip-making startup and Japan's most ambitious, and risky, bet on technological sovereignty since the 1980s. Founded by eight major Japanese companies, including Toyota and Sony, Rapidus aims to mass produce two-nanometer chips by 2027, bringing Japan back to the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing after falling two decades behind.

At the same time, Japan has gone on the economic offensive against Beijing. It has joined the United States and Europe in restricting exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China. Tokyo has also curbed Chinese investment in sensitive Japanese technologies. The combined effect has been to deny Chinese firms the specialized tools and intellectual property needed to make high-end chips. And crucially, Japan imposed sanctions on Russia outside a UN mandate—a notable departure from its historically cautious approach. It is clear that Tokyo is prepared to meet aggression with tough economic action.

Still, there is even more that Japan can do to improve its economic security, such as protecting its pharmaceutical supply chains. China dominates the global production of essential medicines, including breakthrough drugs, and controls many of the world's key pharmaceutical ingredients, giving it massive leverage over the public health of Japan and its allies. Tokyo and Washington should coordinate on pharmaceutical security by mapping supply chain dependencies, investing in alternative manufacturing capacity, and cracking down against unauthorized distribution networks that provide Beijing with backdoors to manipulate supply volumes and degrade drug quality.

Protecting the region from China's economic and military dominance must ultimately involve coordination among all four members of the Quad. An allied response to Chinese industrial policy cannot simply subsidize domestic production in each country, which would lead to inefficient duplication and fail to create a combined market large enough to compete with the scale of China's state-led economy. Instead, Australia, India, and the United States can work with Japan to build on Tokyo's manufacturing leadership.

Japan has a history of transferring its manufacturing excellence to other countries. In the 1980s, when Japanese automakers established so-called transplant factories in the United States, they did more than just build cars—they transformed American manufacturing culture. A joint venture between Toyota and General Motors in Fremont, California, took a failed GM plant with abysmal productivity and combative labor relations and turned it into a model of efficiency within a year. Toyota sent hundreds of U.S. workers to Japan for intense training, then embedded Japanese managers as on-site mentors who worked side by side with their American counterparts. The transformation was remarkable: the same workforce, using similar equipment, achieved Japanese-level quality and productivity.

Today, the Quad should apply this model to the production of advanced batteries, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, aerospace and hypersonic materials, and precision robots. Japan, for instance, produces 45 percent of the world's industrial robots. Its expertise could dramatically improve manufacturing productivity across Quad countries. And with Australia's critical minerals, India's rare-earth processing capabilities, Japan's manufacturing precision, and the United States' research and development and market scale, each member of the Quad brings something the rest need. By sharing knowledge and their respective domestic advantages, Quad members can genuinely increase their productivity, not just rest on subsidies.

Once these countries have built up their capacity, they should, through a series of bilateral trade agreements or “minilateral” partnerships, finally cut China out of critical supply chains in pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, drones, and legacy chips. The end result would be a trading system protected from China's economic coercion. To be sure, excluding China would be costly. It remains the largest trade partner for Australia, Japan, and the United States. But by diverting trade flows toward one another, Quad members can ditch the vulnerability of the Chinese market for the collective security of its most reliable partners.

Cutting China out, as painful as it would be, would simply head off the inevitable. For at least two decades, Beijing has systematically squeezed Australian, Indian, Japanese, and U.S. companies out of its market when they are no longer needed for its industrial plans. If Japan took the lead on this reorientation, it could at least control some aspects of how the decoupling process unfolds.

Beijing's campaign to manufacture political controversy over Takaichi's Taiwan comments reflects a broader objective: to intimidate Japanese policymakers, divide Japan's governing coalition, and deter other supporters of Taiwan from speaking out. Chinese leaders understand that the U.S.-Japanese alliance represents the single biggest obstacle to their ambitions for regional primacy. A Japan that is economically resilient, diplomatically active, and militarily capable undermines Beijing's plan to isolate Taiwan, coerce its neighbors, and raise the costs of U.S. engagement.

The United States' faint support of Japan in its spat with China undermines deterrence in the western Pacific. The United States should stand with its ally by endorsing Takaichi's comments about the existential nature of a Taiwan crisis for Japan and other allies. Washington has an interest in fostering a broad coalition that speaks out against Chinese aggression toward Taiwan because China is more likely to be deterred from attacking the island if it believes many countries will rise in opposition. Silence, by contrast, signals to Beijing that it can peel off U.S. allies one by one through economic pressure—and that Washington will not defend those who call out China's behavior.

The United States and Japan stand at a pivotal juncture. As Tokyo continues to take bold steps to prepare for an era of prolonged confrontation with China, Washington's commitment is wavering. Tokyo has done the hard part. Now it is time for Washington to step up. If it doesn't, it will prove Beijing right—that the United States' alliances are temporary, its promises are hollow, and its power is in decline.

BAKU, January 30. /TASS/. Azerbaijan will never allow its territory or airspace to be used to carry out strikes against Iran, Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov said during a phone call with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi.

"On January 29, Jeyhun Bayramov held a phone call with Abbas Araghchi. It was particularly emphasized that the Republic of Azerbaijan will never allow any country to use its airspace or territory to conduct military operations against Iran or any other country," the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Bayramov emphasized that Baku's position is principled and unwavering. He said Azerbaijan consistently opposes actions and rhetoric that could destabilize Iran or the surrounding region.

"During the phone call, the sides also exchanged views on other bilateral and regional issues of mutual interest," the ministry added.

Journalist Don Lemon and three other people were arrested Friday in connection with an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church and increased tensions between residents and federal officials.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Journalist Don Lemon has been charged with federal civil rights crimes in connection with an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Friday.

Lemon was arrested Thursday by federal agents in Los Angeles, where he had been covering the Grammy Awards, his attorney Abbe Lowell said. He was expected to appear in court there Friday afternoon. 

The veteran journalist is charged with conspiracy and interfering with the First Amendment rights of worshipers during a Jan. 18 protest at the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor. Another journalist and two protest participants were also arrested in Minnesota.

Lemon, who was fired from CNN in 2023, has said he has no affiliation to the organization that went into the church and that he was there as an independent journalist chronicling protesters.

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the arrest of Don Lemon after a Minneapolis church protest.

“Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,” Lowell said in a statement earlier Friday. “The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable.” 

Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed the arrest of Lemon and the others who were present during the protest.

“At my direction, early this morning federal agents arrested Don Lemon, Trahern Jeen Crews, Georgia Fort, and Jamael Lydell Lundy, in connection with the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota,” Bondi said on social media.

Since he left CNN, Lemon has joined the legion of journalists who have gone into business for himself, posting regularly on YouTube. He hasn't hidden his disdain for President Donald Trump. Yet during his online show from the church, he said repeatedly: “I'm not here as an activist. I'm here as a journalist.” He described the scene before him, and interviewed churchgoers and demonstrators.

A magistrate judge last week rejected prosecutors' initial bid to charge the veteran journalist. Shortly after, he predicted on his show that the administration would try again. 

“And guess what,” he said. “Here I am. Keep trying. That's not going to stop me from being a journalist. That's not going to diminish my voice. Go ahead, make me into the new Jimmy Kimmel, if you want. Just do it. Because I'm not going anywhere.”

Fort, an independent journalist, livestreamed the moments before her arrest Friday on Facebook Live.

“I don't feel like I have my First Amendment right as a member of the press because now the federal agents are at my door arresting me for filming the church protest a few weeks ago,” Fort said.

It was not immediately clear if Fort and the two other Minnesotans who were arrested have attorneys.

The arrests brought sharp criticism from news media advocates and civil rights activists. The Rev. Al Sharpton said the Trump administration was taking a “sledge hammer” to “the knees of the First Amendment.”

Kelly McBride, a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute, said the arrests and the recent search of a Washington Post journalist's home were intended to intimidate journalists documenting opposition to the president's policies.

In an Instagram post, the National Association of Black Journalists said it was “outraged and deeply alarmed” by Lemon's arrest. The group called it an effort to “criminalize and threaten press freedom under the guise of law enforcement.”

Crews is a leader of Black Lives Matter Minnesota who has led many protests and actions for racial justice, particularly following George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis in 2020.

After Trump administration officials said earlier this month that arrests would be coming in the church protest, Crews told The Associated Press there's a “tradition” of Black activists and leaders being targeted or subjected to violence.

“Just as being a Black person, you always have to have that in mind,” Crews said.

A prominent civil rights attorney and two other people involved in the protest were arrested last week. Prosecutors have accused them of civil rights violations for disrupting the Cities Church service.

The Justice Department launched a civil rights investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,” referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. 

Jordan Kushner, an attorney for Nekima Levy Armstrong, who was in the first group arrested, said the latest prosecutions “are beyond the pale.”

“Nonviolent protest is not a federal felony,” Kushner said.

Lundy is an intergovernmental affairs manager in the office of Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, and is married to St. Paul City Council Member Anika Bowie. Bowie and Moriarty could not be reached for comment.

Lemon briefly interviewed Lundy, who is also a candidate for state senate, as they gathered with protesters preparing to drive to the church.

“I feel like it's important that if you're going to be representing people in office that you are out here with the people,” he told Lemon, adding he believed in “direct action, certainly within the lines of the law.”

Cities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads ICE's St. Paul field office. 

“We are grateful that the Department of Justice acted swiftly to protect Cities Church so that we can continue to faithfully live out the church's mission to worship Jesus and make him known,” lead pastor Jonathan Parnell said Friday in a statement.

“Make no mistake. Under President Trump's leadership and this administration, you have the right to worship freely and safely,” Bondi said in a video posted to social media on Friday. “And if I haven't been clear already, if you violate that sacred right, we are coming after you.”

Live Updates


• Anti-ICE protests: Nationwide demonstrations are expected today against President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement efforts. Organizers are calling for a boycott of school, work and shopping. In the Minneapolis area, protesters are gathering outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building.
    


• Don Lemon in custody: The former CNN anchor was taken into custody, according to his attorney, in connection to a protest in which dozens of anti-ICE demonstrators rushed into a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, leading to tense confrontations. Independent journalist Georgia Fort, who was filming the protest, also was taken into custody.
    


• Alex Pretti shooting: The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the Pretti shooting in Minnesota. The probe will look into whether the Department of Homeland Security officers violated the law in shooting Pretti. This marks an expansion of the federal investigation that was being led by the FBI.
    


            A planned national shutdown to protest federal actions in Minneapolis has resulted in closed businesses and kids walking out of classes across the country, with groups calling for “no work, no school, no shopping.”
    


            Businesses from North Carolina to New England to Washington state closed their doors. A restaurant in Portland, Maine, posted to its Facebook account they were closing in “solidarity with countless other restaurants in this city and across the country.”
    


            Other businesses posted to social media accounts they would be open but would donate their profits to groups supporting immigrants in Minnesota.
    


            Video showed students walking out of schools in both Arizona and Georgia. School districts in Colorado preemptively canceled classes for Friday in anticipation of protests. Aurora, Colorado, schools said they were canceling classes “due to a higher than anticipated number of staff absences.”
    


            Gatherings of protestors were planned in a number of cities, including New York, Atlanta and Chicago, with the first of the day kicking off at the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis Friday morning.
    


            The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday.
    


            In past administrations, such a probe would investigate whether the Department of Homeland Security officers violated the law in shooting Pretti.
    


            Blanche was not clear during Friday's news conference on the extent of the probe. The FBI is conducting a “standard investigation,” and, “to the extent it needs to involve lawyers at the Civil Rights Division, it will involve those,” Blanche said.
    


            The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has conducted previous investigations into law enforcement — including shootings, instances of potential police brutality or potential hate crimes — to make sure that the officers did not breach the rights of a victim, even if that investigation never results in charges.
    


            In such probes, federal officials keep their investigative eye towards violations of civil rights laws, while local law enforcement focus on potential state charges, such as murder, assault or anything else befitting the case.
    


            One example of a case that led to a civil rights investigation against a law enforcement officer: The 2020 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Former police officer Derek Chauvin pleaded guilty in federal court to civil rights charges.
    


            Another case: The 2023 death of Tyre Nichols after an encounter with police in Memphis, Tennessee. Five officers were convicted of various federal charges in Nichols' death. That includes one found guilty of violating Nichols' civil rights by causing bodily injury and showing deliberate indifference to medical needs, and two who pleaded guilty to violating Nichols' civil rights by causing death.
    


CNN's Evan Perez, Hannah Rabinowitz and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this reporting.



            Members of the media spoke out in support of independent journalist Georgia Fort a short time ago, demanding her release and warning that journalism – and the First Amendment – are under attack.
    


            “This is wrong,” Fort's teenage daughter said tearfully about her mother's arrest. “She is not a protester. She is not an activist. She is a mom working to provide for her children through the only way she knows how – documenting and sharing stories of the community, and truth of what's happening here every day in our state.”
    


               Former Minneapolis NAACP President Leslie Redmond called on local leadership for support at a time she described as “a state of emergency.”
    


            “It's not a joke, it's not a drill,” she said. “And I'm wondering where our leadership is? Where is Governor (Tim) Walz, where is Mayor (Jacob) Frey? Where are all of our representatives?”
    


            “Democracy is crumbling,” Harry Colbert Jr., the vice president of The Center for Broadcast Journalism, said.
    


Remember: Fort and former CNN anchor Don Lemon are in federal custody Friday in connection to a protest they filmed where dozens of anti-ICE demonstrators rushed into a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier this month.
    


            Independent journalist and former CNN anchor Don Lemon is facing two federal charges in connection to an anti-ICE protest at a St. Paul church, according to his lawyer.
    


            Lemon's lawyer Abbe Lowell told CNN the journalist has been charged with two federal crimes: conspiring to violate someone's constitutional rights and violating the FACE Act, which prohibits the use of force or threats to intentionally interfere with someone expressing their First Amendment right to religion.
    


            Court records related to the arrest were not immediately available. Lemon is expected to appear in federal court in Los Angeles on Friday.
    


            Immigrant rights advocates filed a lawsuit on Friday challenging a recently disclosed policy adopted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement allowing its officers to enter the homes of people suspected of living in the United States illegally without a judicial warrant.
    


            The lawsuit by the Greater Boston Latino Network and the Brazilian Worker Center was filed in federal court in Boston and marked the first case to challenge the constitutionality of a policy laid out in a May memo issued by ICE that became public last week as a result of a whistleblower complaint.
    


            The policy marked a departure for ICE, whose agents in the past had generally been barred from entering private homes and businesses without a warrant signed by a federal judge.
    


            But as President Donald Trump's administration ramped up immigration enforcement last year in its quest to carry out mass deportations, the acting head of ICE issued the memo advising its agents they could rely instead on administrative warrants.
    


            The lawsuit argues that allowing ICE officers to enter someone's home to conduct arrests, even with force, based solely on such an administrative warrant violates the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.
    


            Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the new policy eliminated a guardrail designed to protect people's rights as ICE escalates enforcement operations in numerous states including Minnesota with aggressive tactics that several judges had ruled unlawful.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment, but a spokesperson has previously said those served with administrative warrants “have had full due process and a final order of removal from an immigration judge.”
    


            Organizers have called for a nationwide strike Friday, encouraging people to avoid shopping and walk out of school and work as a way to speak out against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.
    


            Here is how demonstrators are making their voices heard today:
    


            New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is proposing legislation to ban cooperation agreements between local police departments and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
    


            Known as the 287(g) program, it allows ICE to authorize state and local law enforcement officers to perform specific immigration enforcement duties under ICE's supervision.
    


            “With this proposal we're sending a strong message to ICE: You will not weaponize local police officers against their own communities in the state of New York,” Hochul said in a Friday news conference in Manhattan alongside several law enforcement officials from across the state.
    


            ICE currently has 287(g) agreements with law enforcement agencies in around 40 states, data published by the agency shows.  In the state of New York, there are 14 law enforcement agencies with agreements in place.
    


            The governor's proposal does not completely ban all cooperation. Local departments would still be required to work with immigration enforcement and federal law enforcement to detain people accused of violent crimes.
    


            It would also ban ICE from using local police technology or databases to track people unless they have a judicial warrant, the governor said.
    


            Hochul's proposal will go before the State legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, making the measure likely to pass.
    


Context: Hochul has called on Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to step down. She has stopped short of saying ICE should be abolished, a posture which several Democrats in New York have adopted in the aftermath of increased ICE enforcement around the country and violence in Minneapolis.
    


            The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday.
    


            “All that that means is that (the Department of Homeland Security), as they've, as the Secretary has said, is conducting an investigation, as they should,” Blanche said. “And as they do every time there's a tragic event like this, and the FBI, in their role which is a separate role from DHS, is also take looking into it and conducting investigation.”
    


            CNN previously reported that the FBI is taking the lead on the investigation into Pretti, which was initially handled by DHS's investigative agency.
    


            The announcement means that the Justice Department is looking into whether the DHS officers who shot Pretti violated the law, and marks an expansion of the federal government's investigation into the matter.
    


            Customs and Border Protection are also conducting an internal probe on the officers who shot and killed Pretti.
    


            Later on during Friday's press conference, Blanche appeared to backtrack from his initial confirmation.
    


            “I don't want to overstate what's happening,” Blanche said. “I don't want the takeaway to be that there's some massive civil rights investigation that's happening.”
    


            Blanche added that it was “a standard investigation by the FBI” and said that “when there's circumstances like what we saw last Saturday, and that investigation, to the extent it needs to involve lawyers at the Civil Rights Division, it will involve those.”
    


Read the latest from CNN Investigates: How two federal agents escalated an encounter with Alex Pretti into a deadly shooting



            The FBI is now leading the investigation into the shooting of Alex Pretti by Customs and Border Protection officers in Minnesota, taking over the investigation from the Department of Homeland Security's investigative agency, HSI, a senior DHS official confirmed to CNN.
    


            In the wake of the shooting, HSI took the lead on the investigation, with FBI providing support, including by initially processing Pretti's firearm at a local laboratory. FBI Director Kash Patel has previously referred questions about the investigation to DHS.
    


            On Fox News Thursday night, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem also said the FBI was leading the investigation.
    


            This comes after White House aide Stephen Miller's acknowledgement that “may not have been following” proper protocol before the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti.
    


            It's unclear what, exactly, the change means for the investigation and the FBI has, in the past, been the agency tasked with investigating such shootings along with local investigators.
    


            “We will continue to follow the investigation that the FBI is leading,” Noem said Thursday, “and giving them all the information they need to bring that to conclusion – and make sure that the American people know the truth of that situation.”
    


            The White House on Friday issued its first response to the arrest of Don Lemon, sharing an image announcing the former CNN journalist's arrest and quipping, “When life gives you lemons….”
    


            The post also included a chain emoji.
    

When life gives you lemons... ⛓️ pic.twitter.com/wxry0fudOj


            In a post to social media platform X earlier Friday, Bondi announced Lemon's arrest, promising “More details soon.”
    


            White House Deputy Chief of Staff James Blair also reacted to Lemon's arrest in a pair of posts to X criticizing media coverage of the arrest, writing, “A federal grand jury indicted Don Lemon. He was not just magically arrested.”
    


            President Donald Trump has yet to weigh in on Lemon's arrest. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison condemned the arrests of two independent journalists — former CNN anchor Don Lemon and Georgia Fort — in connection with an anti-ICE protest at a St. Paul church this month.
    


            The arrests “are deeply troubling and contrary to the rights our Constitution guarantees us,” he wrote in a post on X Friday morning.
    


                    “In Minnesota we do not treat journalists like criminals for doing their jobs,” Ellison went on. “No one should be arrested merely for holding a camera, asking hard questions, or telling the public what we have a right to know.”
                





            He added: “The First Amendment is not a luxury in a democracy. It is a necessity.”
    


            Lemon and Fort were live-streaming as dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters rushed into Cities Church on January 18, interrupting a church service and leading to tense confrontations.
    


            CNN issued a statement in defense of Don Lemon, who was terminated by the network in 2023.
    


                    “The FBl's arrest of our former CNN colleague Don Lemon raises profoundly concerning questions about press freedom and the First Amendment,” the network said.
                





            “The Department of Justice already failed twice to get an arrest warrant for Don and several other journalists in Minnesota, where a chief judge of the Minnesota Federal District Court found there was 'no evidence' that there was any criminal behavior involved in their work. The First Amendment in the United States protects journalists who bear witness to news and events as they unfold, ensuring they can report freely in the public interest, and the DOJ's attempts to violate those rights is unacceptable. We will be following this case closely.”

            As President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown has whisked through major US cities, trial-level judges attempting to restrain the frenzied actions of federal agents have been repeatedly slapped down by higher courts – often with the help of judges the president put on the bench in his first term.
    


            A series of rulings from the Supreme Court and federal appeals courts dominated by Trump nominees have overturned early victories secured by opponents of the immigration blitzes in California, Chicago and Minnesota.
    


            The administration's latest win came Monday, when a three-judge federal appeals court panel indefinitely paused a Minneapolis judge's decision to put tight guardrails on how agents can respond to individuals peacefully protesting Operation Metro Surge, which has sparked intense opposition in the Twin Cities and led to the fatal shooting of two US citizens by federal officers.
    


            Trump and his allies have long complained that lower court judges have acted out of bounds in cases challenging his agenda, particularly in the immigration context, over which they argue he has broad, unreviewable authority.
    


Read more about the Trump-appointed judges.



            A large crowd of protesters is outside the Whipple Federal Building, the Minneapolis-area site of daily demonstrations against the federal government's immigration enforcement operations.
    


            “ICE out!” demonstrators chanted, bundled up in heavy coats and scarves amid frigid temperatures in Minnesota.
    


            “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here,” sounded another chant.
    


            President Donald Trump said Thursday evening that there were no plans to pull immigration enforcement agents out of Minneapolis, after border czar Tom Homan announced earlier in the day he had ordered federal immigration authorities to work on a drawdown plan.
    


            Asked if he'd be pulling back immigration agents, Trump said, “We'll do whatever we can to keep our country safe.” Pressed again if he was not pulling back, Trump said, “No, no not at all.”
    


            Trump's comments — made at the premiere of first lady Melania Trump's documentary at the Kennedy Center — followed Homan's remarks that morning that he was working on a “draw down plan” to begin reducing the number of immigration agents in the state and insisted that upholding “public safety should be paramount.”
    


            Speaking on the red carpet Thursday evening, Trump heaped praise on Homan, calling the border czar “terrific.”
    


            “I think he's terrific but we have to get rid of the criminals,” Trump said. “We have to take criminals out of our country so from that standpoint, nothing's going to change.”
    


            Press freedom groups are condemning the arrests of journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort in connection with their coverage of an anti-ICE protest inside a Minnesota church on January 18.
    


            “These arrests under bogus legal theories for obviously constitutionally protected reporting are clear warning shots aimed at other journalists,” said Seth Stern, the chief of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation. “The unmistakable message is that journalists must tread cautiously because the government is looking for any way to target them.”
    


            Stern told CNN: “The answer to this outrageous attack is not fear or self-censorship. It's an even stronger commitment to journalism, the truth, and the First Amendment. If the Trump administration thinks it can bully journalists into submission, it is wrong.”
    


            Katherine Jacobsen, the US, Canada and Caribbean program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, said Lemon's arrest “should alarm all Americans.”
    


            “As an international organization, we know that the treatment of journalists is an indicator of the condition of a country's democracy. The United States is doing poorly,” Jacobsen said.
    


            Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the nonprofit advocacy group Public Citizen, called the action against Lemon an “authoritarian breach” and an “egregious violation of the First Amendment.”
    


            “Reporters in America are free to view, document, and share information with the public,” Gilbert said. “This arrest is a constitutional violation, an outrage, an authoritarian breach, and utterly appalling.”
    


Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated the date of the church protest.



            Independent journalist Georgia Fort was taken into custody by federal agents Friday morning, an official who was briefed on the arrest told CNN's Sara Sidner Friday morning.
    


            Fort's arrest comes the morning after former CNN anchor and independent journalist Don Lemon was taken into custody.
    


            Both Fort and Lemon filmed dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters as they rushed into church in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier this month, interrupting a service, leading to tense confrontations.
    


            US Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed in a post this morning on X that Lemon and Fort, as well as two others, were arrested in connection with the church protest. Federal agents arrested the four at Bondi's direction, the post reads.
    


            “This is all stemming from the fact that I filmed a protest as a member of the media,” Fort said during a Facebook Live this morning before she surrendered to agents.
    


                    “We are supposed to have our constitutional right of the freedom to film, to be a member of the press,” she said. “I don't feel like I have my first amendment right as a member of the press because now federal agents are at my door arresting me for filming the church protest a few weeks ago.”
                





            Details on what charges Fort and Lemon face weren't immediately available.
    


            “It's hard to understand how we have a constitution, constitutional rights, when you can just be arrested for being a member of the press,” Fort said before ending this morning's live video.
    


            Journalist Don Lemon was taken into custody on Thursday night in connection to a protest at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, according to his attorney.
    


            Lemon, a former CNN anchor, was with dozens of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protesters as they rushed into Cities Church in St. Paul earlier this month, interrupting a church service and leading to tense confrontations.
    


            Court records related to his arrest were not immediately available. Lemon is expected to appear in federal court in Los Angeles on Friday. Lemon was in Los Angeles to cover the Grammy Awards and was arrested after 11 p.m. local time in a hotel lobby in Beverley Hills as he was leaving for an event.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice for for information.
    


            “Don Lemon was taken into custody by federal agents last night in Los Angeles, where he was covering the Grammy awards,” his attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement early Friday. “Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done. The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable.”

This post has been updated.



            Overnight, US President Donald Trump in a social media post referred to Alex Pretti, the man fatally shot by Customs and Border Protection agents in Minneapolis Saturday, as an “agitator and, perhaps, insurrectionist.”
    


            This matches the language the Trump administration has been using when classifying protesters across the country, calling those demonstrating their opposition to Trump's immigration offensive “agitators.”
    


            Here's the backstory on how the word has been used:
    


            Read more here.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last night that she was using “the best information we had at the time” when she made her initial statements about the killing of Alex Pretti, the second person killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month.
    


                    “We were using the best information we had at the time, seeking to be transparent with the American people and get them what we knew to be true on the ground,” she told Fox News' Sean Hannity.
                





            Noem, who was among the top officials claiming in the immediate aftermath of the shooting that ICU nurse Alex Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” who posed a threat to law enforcement, on Thursday described the situation as “chaotic” and noted she was “being relayed information from on the ground from (Customs and Border Protection) agents and officers that were there.”
    


            Noem's comments come as she faces increased scrutiny of her job performance and her initial statements on the circumstances around Pretti's killing.
    


CNN reported earlier Thursday that President Donald Trump and his top officials have publicly and privately maintained that the president still has full confidence in Noem, even as he has moved to sideline one of his top officials on the ground, Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino, putting border czar Tom Homan in charge of immigration operations in Minneapolis.

FOX Business contributor Phil Flynn reacts to the U.S. having its first $500 million sale of Venezuelan oil, the impact of the sale and more on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodriguez signed a law overhauling the nation's oil sector, opening it to privatization. The move reverses a core policy of the socialist movement that has ruled the country for more than two decades.

Rodriguez's policy shift, aimed at luring the foreign investors needed to rework the industry, comes less than one month after the U.S. captured former Venezuelan dictatorial leader Nicolás Maduro. The acting president, who served as Maduro's vice president prior to his capture, was facing pressure from the Trump administration, which was eyeing Venezuela's oil industry after imposing sanctions.

On Jan. 10, Trump hosted nearly two dozen top oil and gas executives at the White House. He said American energy companies will invest $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's "rotting" oil infrastructure and push production to record levels.

That same day, Trump signed an executive order titled "Safeguarding Venezuelan Oil Revenue for the Good of the American and Venezuelan People," blocking U.S. courts from seizing Venezuelan oil revenues held in American Treasury accounts.

"We're talking about the future. We are talking about the country that we are going to give to our children," Rodríguez said of the reform, according to The Associated Press.

The legislation ends the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela SA's (PDVSA) monopoly over the production and sale of oil, as well as pricing, and allows private companies to take control, the AP reported. 

The new law states that a private company "will assume full management of the activities at its own expense, account, and risk, after demonstrating its financial and technical capacity through a business plan approved by" Venezuela's Oil Ministry, according to the AP. However, the outlet added that the law leaves control of hydrocarbon reserves operated by private companies with the government.

The law also allows for independent arbitration of disputes, ending the requirement that they be settled in Venezuelan courts controlled by the ruling party, according to the AP. Additionally, it modifies extraction taxes, setting a royalty cap rate of 30%, the AP reported.

President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Rodriguez on Thursday, the AP reported. The call came just one day after the secretary explained to senators how the administration was planning to handle the sale of tens of millions of barrels of oil from Venezuela, the AP added. The outlet noted that Venezuela has the largest reserves of crude oil in the world.

"What we hope to do is transition to a mechanism that allows that to be sold in a normal way, a normal oil industry, not one dominated by cronies, not one dominated by graft and corruption," Rubio said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday.

The secretary said that the U.S. would retain control of the oil revenue and that Venezuela would submit monthly budget outlining what they need funded. Subsequently, the funds will be moved into an account over which the U.S. will have oversight. He explained that the money would not be in the hands of the U.S., but Washington would control its disbursement to ensure it benefits the Venezuelan people.

National champion head coach Lou Holtz has reportedly entered hospice care at the age of 89.

Best known for manning the sidelines at Arkansas and Notre Dame, Holtz coached college football for 33 years. He was the head coach of the Fighting Irish for 11 seasons from 1986-1996, where he finished with a 110-30-2 record. 

ABC57 in Indiana was one of the first to report the news.

In 1988, Notre Dame finished with a perfect 12-0 record and claimed the Fiesta Bowl, which remains their last national championship. He went 249-132-7 in his coaching career.

Holtz rose to even further prominence during his time as a college football analyst on ESPN.

He played at Kent State before moving into coaching as an assistant in 1960, then got his first head coaching job in 1969 at William & Mary. Holtz later left for N.C. State, spending four seasons in Raleigh, before giving the NFL a shot. That stint didn't work out, though, as the Jets went 3-10 and he stepped down.

In recent years, Holtz has been a stern supporter of President Donald Trump. In February 2024, Holtz posted to social media that the country "need[ed] to coach America back to greatness!"

Holtz, who spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention, was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Trump in 2020, shortly after former President Joe Biden defeated him in the election.

"It's the highest honor or award you could possibly receive, and I receive it with mixed emotions. First of all, I'm humbled," Holtz told "Fox & Friends" afterward. "There are many more people far worthy than me, I can assure you. Nobody is more appreciative than me. So, I'm excited to have this opportunity and at the same time, I'm excited to receive it from President Trump. The president I admire and respect. I think he did a tremendous job."

Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports on new details from the United Nations Security Council meeting after a Russian strike in Ukraine on ‘The Story.'

As the Trump administration slashes funding and exits multiple international bodies over criticism that the U.N. has failed to promote U.S. interests, the United Nations is warning it could face a cash crisis by July. 

In a Jan. 28 letter from U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres to ambassadors, he cited record unpaid dues and rigid budget rules that have left the organization exposed.

Guterres said the U.N. is trapped in a "Kafkaesque cycle" in which rigid budget rules force it to return "unspent" funds even when those contributions were never paid. He said outstanding dues reached a record $1.568 billion at the end of 2025 and that collections covered only 76.7% of assessed contributions, leaving the organization dangerously exposed.

Unless collections "drastically improve," the secretary-general warned, the U.N. will not be able to fully implement its 2026 budget and could face a liquidity crisis by mid-year.

UN CHIEF ACCUSES US OF DITCHING INTERNATIONAL LAW AS TRUMP BLASTS GLOBAL BODIES

A senior diplomatic source told Fox News Digital that the secretary-general himself bears significant responsibility for the deepening crisis, arguing that warning signs had been visible long before the current shortfall.

According to the source, major contributors had been pressing for efficiency and reform for years, yet meaningful action was delayed. When reforms were eventually introduced, the source said, they were applied broadly rather than through targeted cuts in areas where real savings were possible, harming even U.N. bodies considered central to the organization's mission. "He is going to go down as the worst secretary-general in the history of the U.N.," the source said.

TRUMP ADMIN EXIT FROM UN, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS RAISES QUESTION OF WHO'S NEXT

The warning from Guterres comes as the United States, the world body's largest contributor, has cut voluntary funding to multiple U.N. programs and declined to make some required payments, deepening the cash crunch described in the secretary-general's letter.

Broader U.S. foreign assistance cuts under the Trump administration's foreign policy realignment. In January 2026, the United States formally withdrew from the World Health Organization and began exiting dozens of international bodies, including multiple U.N. entities, citing misalignment with American priorities.

The funding squeeze has already forced the United Nations to tighten spending across several agencies. Separate Reuters reporting shows that U.N. bodies, including the World Food Programme and refugee agencies, are preparing layoffs and program reductions as overall contributions fall to the lowest level in a decade.

Hugh Dugan, former National Security Council special assistant to the president and senior director for international organization affairs, told Fox News Digital that the current turmoil reflects long-standing structural weaknesses rather than a sudden collapse.

"We've heard this before," Dugan told Fox News Digital, referring to repeated warnings from U.N. leadership over cash shortfalls.

Dugan said the organization has struggled for decades with inconsistent revenue and outdated financial practices, arguing that alarmist messaging is unlikely to restore donor confidence without visible internal reforms.

He said Guterres, who has roughly 11 months remaining in office, appears focused on ensuring the institution does not close on his watch.

"The doors will remain open, maybe just, but that's his legacy," Dugan said.

Asked about President Trump's newly announced peace board, Dugan said it should not be viewed as a competitor to the United Nations or a replacement for its charter-based system.

"I don't see it as a replacement of the principles of the U.N.," he said, describing the initiative as operational rather than ideological.

Dugan compared it to past convening efforts such as the Clinton Global Initiative, saying it focuses on dealmaking and coordination rather than supplanting the international order.

Despite mounting criticism of its performance and finances, Dugan said the U.N. continues to hold one enduring advantage.

Referring to the annual U.N. General Assembly debate, Dugan said, "When the U.N. calls a meeting today, it's routine to have more than 100 heads of state in the room," he said. "The power to convene is no small accomplishment."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's nomination on Friday of Kevin Warsh to chair the Federal Reserve could bring about sweeping changes at a central bank that dominates the global economy and markets like no other. 

Warsh, if approved by the Senate, will be under close scrutiny from financial markets and Congress given his appointment by a president who has loudly demanded much lower rates than many economists think are justified by economic conditions. Whether he can maintain the Fed's long time independence from day-to-day politics while also placating Trump will be a tremendous challenge. 

Still, former associates and friends of Warsh say that he has the intellectual heft and people skills to potentially pull it off. His family also has connections to Trump that could reduce the pressure from the White House. 

Warsh has “a judicious temperament and both the intellectual understanding but also the hopefully diplomatic talents to navigate what is a challenging position at this point,” said Raghuram Rajan, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and formerly head of India's central bank. 

Warsh would replace current chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in May. Trump chose Powell to lead the Fed in 2017 but this year has relentlessly assailed him for not cutting interest rates quickly enough.

“I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,” Trump posted on social media. “On top of everything else, he is ‘central casting,' and he will never let you down.”




Trump said later Friday in the Oval Office that he didn't ask Warsh to commit to cutting rates, calling such a question “inappropriate” and adding, “I want to keep it nice and pure.”

But Trump added, “But he certainly wants to cut rates.”

The appointment, which requires Senate confirmation, amounts to a return trip for Warsh, 55, who was a member of the Fed's board from 2006 to 2011. He was the youngest governor in history when he was appointed at age 35. He is currently a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. 

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on President Trump's pick to lead the Federal Reserve.

In some ways, Warsh is an unlikely choice for the Republican president because he has long supported higher interest rates to control inflation. Trump, by contrast, has said the Fed's key rate should be as low as 1%, a level few economists endorse, and far below its current level of about 3.6%. 

During his time as governor, Warsh objected to some of the low-interest rate policies that the Fed pursued during and after the Great Recession of 2008-09. He also often expressed concern at that time that inflation would soon accelerate, even though it remained at rock-bottom levels for many years after that recession ended. 

More recently, however, in speeches and opinion columns, Warsh has voiced support for lower rates, seemingly coming in line with Trump's point of view. 

Financial markets reacted in ways that suggest investors expect Warsh could keep rates a bit higher over time. The dollar and yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys ticked higher. U.S. stocks fell about 0.5%. The biggest moves were in the volatile metals markets, where gold dropped more than 5% and silver sank more than 13%.

In Congress, Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, reiterated in a social media post that he will oppose Warsh's nomination until a Justice Department investigation into Powell is resolved. 

Tillis is on the Senate committee that will consider Warsh's nomination. 

He added that Warsh is a “qualified nominee,” but stressed that “protecting the independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference or legal intimidation is non-negotiable.”

Tillis's opposition could complicate the confirmation process. Asked late Thursday whether Warsh could be confirmed without Tillis's support, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, “probably not.”

Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee, said, “This nomination is the latest step in Trump's attempt to seize control of the Fed.”

Warsh has frequently criticized the Fed for its ownership of trillions of dollars in government and mortgage-backed securities, which it accumulated after the Great Recession and during the pandemic. 

Warsh has charged that the massive bond-buying, which was intended to lower longer-term interest rates and boost the economy, enabled Congress to ramp up spending without concern for higher borrowing costs. 

Reducing the Fed's $6.6 trillion balance sheet, however, will be a fraught exercise because banks have become accustomed to the large amounts of cash in the financial system that it provides. 

Warsh has also said the Fed's economic models wrongly assume that rapid economic growth threatens to elevate inflation. Instead, “Inflation is caused when government spends too much and prints too much,” he wrote in a November column in The Wall Street Journal.

The announcement comes after an extended and unusually public search. The chair of the Federal Reserve is tasked with combating inflation in the United States while also supporting maximum employment. The Fed is also the nation's top banking regulator. 

The Fed's rate decisions, over time, influence borrowing costs throughout the economy, including for mortgages, car loans and credit cards. 

Trump has sought to exert more control over the Fed. In August he tried to fire Lisa Cook, one of seven governors on the Fed's board, in an effort to secure a majority of the board. Cook, however, sued to keep her job, and the Supreme Court, in a hearing last week, appeared inclined to let her stay in her position while her suit is resolved. 

Powell revealed this month that the Fed had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department about his congressional testimony on a $2.5 billion building renovation. Powell said the subpoenas were “pretexts” to force the Fed to cut rates. 

Warsh has expressed support for the president's economic policies, despite a history as a more conventional, pro-free trade Republican. 

In a January 2025 column in The Wall Street Journal, Warsh praised Trump's deregulatory policies and potential spending cuts, which he said would help bring down inflation. He has also suggested that artificial intelligence will boost productivity, making the economy more efficient while reducing inflation. Lower inflation would allow the Fed to lower rates. 

In December, Trump wrote on social media of the need for lower borrowing costs and said, “Anyone who disagrees with me will never be the Fed chairman!”

If confirmed, Warsh would face challenges in pushing interest rates much lower. The chair is just one member of the Fed's 19-person rate-setting committee, with 12 of those officials voting on each rate decision. The committee is already split between those worried about persistent inflation, who'd like to keep rates unchanged, and those who think that recent upticks in unemployment point to a stumbling economy that needs lower interest rates to bolster hiring. 

Financial markets could also push back. If the Fed cuts its short-term rate too aggressively and is seen as doing so for political reasons, then Wall Street investors could sell Treasury bonds out of fear that inflation would rise. Such sales would push up longer-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, and backfire on Warsh.

Trump considered appointing Warsh as Fed chair during his first term, though ultimately he went with Powell. Warsh's father-in-law is Ronald Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune and a longtime donor and confidant of Trump's.

Protesters across the U.S. are calling for “no work, no school, no shopping” as part of a nationwide strike on Friday to oppose the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

The demonstrations are taking place amid widespread outrage over the killing Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse who was shot multiple times after he used his cellphone to record Border Patrol officers conducting an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis. The death heightened scrutiny over the administration's tactics after the Jan. 7 death of Renee Good, who was fatally shot behind the wheel of her vehicle by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

“The people of the Twin Cities have shown the way for the whole country — to stop ICE's reign of terror, we need to SHUT IT DOWN,” said one of the many websites and social media pages promoting actions in communities around the United States.

Some schools in Arizona, Colorado and other states preemptively canceled classes in anticipation of mass absences. Many other demonstrations were planned for students and others to gather at city centers, statehouses and churches across the country.

Just outside Minneapolis, hundreds gathered in the frigid cold early Friday at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, the site of regular protests in recent weeks.

After speeches from clergy members, demonstrators marched toward the facility's restricted area, jeering at a line of DHS agents to “quit your jobs” and “get out of Minnesota.” Much of the group later dispersed after they were threatened with arrest by local law enforcement for blocking the road.




Michelle Pasko, a retired communications worker, said she joined the demonstration after witnessing federal agents stopping immigrants at a bus stop near her home in Minnetonka, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.

“They're roaming our streets, they're staying in hotels near our schools,” she said. “Everyone in this country has rights, and the federal government seems to have forgotten that. We're here to remind them.”

In Michigan, dozens of students walked out of Friday morning classes at Groves High School in Birmingham, north of Detroit. The students braved the zero-degree temperatures and walked about a mile to the closest business district where a number of morning commuters honked horns in support.

“We're here to protest ICE and what they're doing all over the country, especially in Minnesota,” said Logan Albritton, a 17-year-old senior at Groves. “It's not right to treat our neighbors and our fellow Americans this way.”

Numerous businesses announced they would be closed during Friday's “blackout.” Others said they would be staying open, but donating a portion of their proceeds to organizations that support immigrants and provide legal aid to those facing deportation. 

Otway Restaurant and its sister Otway Bakery in New York posted on social media that its bakery would stay open and 50% of proceeds would go to the New York Immigration Coalition. The restaurant remained open as well.

“As a small business who already took a huge financial hit this week due to the winter storm closures, we will remain open on Friday,” they posted.

In Maine, where Republican Sen. Susan Collins announced that ICE is ending its surge, people gathered outside a Portland church on Friday morning, holding signs that said “No ICE for ME,” a play on the state's postal code. 

Grace Valenzuela, an administrator with Portland Public Schools, decried an “enforcement system that treats our presence as suspect.” She said ICE's actions brought “daily trauma” to the school system.

“Schools are meant to be places of learning, safety and belonging. ICE undermines that mission every time it destabilizes a family,” Valenzuela said.

Portland Mayor Mark Dion, a Democrat, spoke about the importance of speaking out in the wake of ICE's actions in the city.

“Dissent is Democratic. Dissent is American. It's the cornerstone of our democracy,” Dion said.

CNN reporters are reviewing the files, which stem from the investigation into the convicted sex offender


            • The Justice Department is releasing more than 3 million pages of files related to the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein today, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche saying the department has now completed its review of the Epstein files.
    


            • Blanche said the White House had “no oversight” of the review of documents and firmly stated that “we did not protect President Trump.” He said any member of Congress can view unredacted versions at the Department of Justice.
    


            • CNN reporters are going through the documents now, and we will share information here as we learn more.
    


            After Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre filed a defamation lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell in 2015, Jeffrey Epstein sat for a deposition in the case, which was first unsealed in 2024.
    


            In the deposition from September 2016, Epstein repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate when asked more than a dozen questions about his relationship with former President Bill Clinton or the Clinton Foundation.
    


            Some examples of the questions asked to Epstein were to “Please describe all dinners you've ever had with Bill Clinton” and “Please list every place you and Bill Clinton have ever been together.”
    


            Lawyers also asked Epstein repeatedly about whether Clinton visited his private island and flew on his private plane. They also repeatedly asked Epstein whether he's heard of the Clinton Foundation and for all his interactions with it.
    


            For every question, Epstein responded: “Fifth.”
    


            A spokesperson for Clinton has repeatedly said the former president cut ties with Epstein before he was charged with soliciting prostitution in 2006 and didn't know about his crimes.
    


            Recently, the Clintons rebuffed a subpoena from the Republican-led House Oversight Committee to have them testify in a congressional probe related to Epstein. The House voted to hold the Clintons in contempt earlier this month.
    


            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday the White House had “no oversight” of the review of documents related to the Epstein investigation.
    


            “Let me just be clear — they had nothing to do with this review,” Blanche said. “They had no oversight over this review. They did not tell this department how to do our review, what to look for, what to redact, what to not redact.”
    


            Critics have repeatedly accused the Justice Department of withholding documents that referenced President Donald Trump and of attempting to divert attention away by implying democratic officials were involved in Epstein's alleged abuse.
    


            Blanche repeatedly denied the assertion, firmly stating that “we did not protect President Trump.”
    


            “There's this mantra out there that the Department of Justice is supposed to protect Donald J. Trump,” he said. “That's not true. That was never the case. We are always concerned about the victims.”
    


            The deputy attorney general conceded, however, that “There's a hunger or a thirst for information that I do not think will be satisfied by the review of these documents. There's nothing I can do about that.”
    


            The latest tranche of Epstein documents released by the Department of Justice on Friday include fresh information about his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, including booking photos with weight and height details, as well as pictures of her New Hampshire home from search warrant requests.
    


            The newly released documents also contain dozens of Maxwell's financial records.
    


            There are documents from Maxwell-linked accounts at UBS, including one that described her investments and showed a balance of $773,775 in March 2019.
    


            There is also a letter describing a $1 million wire transfer in 2016, as well as IRS documents about her tax returns.
    


            CNN's chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid, who attended the Department of Justice's news conference announcing the release of additional documents in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, asked Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche whether additional open investigations were ongoing.
    


            Blanche said that some documents would be withheld due to “ongoing investigations.”
    


            Watch what he said above.
    


            Among the millions of pages of documents, images and videos related to Jeffrey Epstein that the Justice Department released on Friday appear to be numerous “302” forms — written documentation of interviews that the government has conducted.
    


            This is potentially significant because these 302 forms could be related to past interviews that federal agents conducted with alleged Epstein victims. Some survivors have told CNN that they have been desperately in search of information that they previously reported to the FBI about Epstein's alleged crimes and misconduct, wondering whether what they reported to law enforcement was ever acted upon.
    


            It's clear scrolling through some of the 302 forms, however, that they contain heavy redactions. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche made clear that the department sought to redact any personal identifying information about victims, among other things.
    


            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said members of Congress can view unredacted versions of the Jeffrey Epstein files at the Department of Justice.
    


                    “If any member of Congress wishes to review any portions of the response of production in any unredacted form, they're welcome to make arrangements with the department to do so, and we're happy to do that,” Blanche said at a news conference.
                





            The DOJ is allowed to make certain redactions, including personally identifying information of victims, child sexual abuse materials, or information that would jeopardize an active federal investigation.
    


            But lawmakers have criticized the DOJ's redactions so far, and Blanche's comments today provide members with a new opportunity to view the materials in full.
    


            The new tranches of Epstein files the Justice Department released Friday begins with a new page asking whether users are 18 years of age or older.
    


            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, announcing the release, said that the 2,000 videos and 180,000 images released are not all from Epstein or those close to him, noting that they may be explicit in nature.
    


            “They include large quantities of commercial pornography and images that were seized from Epstein's devices, but which he did not take, or that someone around him did not take,” Blanche said.
    


            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche addressed which files were withheld as new documents have been released from the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein today.
    


            “The categories of documents withheld include those permitted under the act to be withheld,” Blanche said.
    


Here's what he said is not in the release:



            “Although the act allows for withholding for items necessary to keep secret in the interest of national security or foreign policy, no files are being withheld or redacted on that basis,” Blanche added.
    


            The Justice Department has completed its review of records related to Jeffrey Epstein and will release the documents throughout the day Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced.
    


            “Today, we are producing more than 3 million pages, including more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images in total, that means that the department produced approximately three and a half million pages in compliance with the act,” Blanche said at a press conference at 11 a.m. ET.
    


            The release will end the months of tension between the Justice Department, federal judges, and some lawmakers over if, and how, to release more than one million documents from the investigation into to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            But it's not clear whether the release of documents will conclude the year-long public outcry from critics who say the department, and Pam Bondi herself, did not follow through on their promise for transparency into what investigators had uncovered in their probe into Epstein's alleged sex trafficking.
    


            The Justice Department has been plagued by the Epstein case since last February when Bondi said that the long-rumored “client list” was sitting on her desk for review. The DOJ later said that Bondi misspoke and was referring generally to documents from his case.
    


            A few months later, however, the Justice Department and FBI released a memo that affirmed Epstein died by suicide, said there was no evidence of a client list, and reneged on Bondi's promises to release investigative files. The memo sparked bipartisan outrage and eventually resulted a new transparency law passed by Congress.
    


            The Justice Department just released more files related to the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            CNN reporters are going through them now, and as we wait to learn more details about the contents of today's release, here's a quick recap of where things stand:
    


How we got here: Congress passed a law in November — with near-unanimous support — giving the Justice Department a December 19, 2025, deadline to release all of its files. Epstein, the convicted sex offender who was accused of abusing dozens of underage girls, died by suicide in 2019.
    


Few files released so far: The Justice Department earlier this month said it had released 12,285 documents — less than 1% — of its Epstein-related files, with more than 2 million documents still in review. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS between January 9-12 found that few Americans are satisfied with the amount of evidence released in the Epstein case, with most saying they believe the government is intentionally holding back information.
    


About the files: The files are made up of papers, videos, photographs and audio files that live within the FBI's main electronic case management system and largely originate from the FBI's two major investigations into Epstein, in Florida and New York, spanning decades. A July 2025 FBI memo said that the department had uncovered “more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence” during a review of the investigative materials.
    


            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche is holding a news conference now at the Department of Justice.
    


            The news conference comes as the department releases more files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.
    


            The Justice Department released another tranche of files related to the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein today.
    


            CNN reporters are going through the documents now, and we will share information as we learn more.

White House border czar Tom Homan vowed Thursday to remain in Minnesota leading Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations there "until the problem is gone." 

A former Biden administration official's social media post lamenting the death of a young child in government custody amid increased immigration operations in Minnesota drew backlash from Republicans, who seized on the fact that the death occurred during the Biden administration. 

Andrew Bates, who previously served as the senior deputy press secretary for former President Joe Biden, on Tuesday retweeted a post from the Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats about Anadith Danay Reyes Alvarez, an 8-year-old who suffered from sickle cell anemia and a heart condition and died in Border Patrol custody in 2023.

Bates wrote alongside the reposted content, "Not about Democrat or Republican/left or right. Just absolutely wrong." 

Bates' post, and the original Senate Judiciary Committee post, prompted comments from conservatives pointing out that Alvarez died in 2023, during President Joe Biden's administration.

"What's remarkable, Andrew, is the level of pride you must have felt when posting this, completely unaware that it had happened while you worked in the White House yourself," Tim Murtaugh, who was President Donald Trump's campaign communications director in 2020, said in response to Bates. "Just remarkable. Top notch work from beginning to end."

Greg Price, Trump White House rapid response manager for the first half of 2025 wrote, "Andy, remind who was in charge of the country in 2023?"

"I stand by what I said. It's horrible and shouldn't have happened," Bates wrote in the post's replies. "What makes me proud is that the American people are rejecting the cruelty that ICE is forcing on Americans and immigrants, putting all of us in danger. I'd hope we could agree on that."

Fox News Digital reached out to Bates for comment. 

The series of social media posts between the White House veterans come amid heightened scrutiny of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in Minneapolis as part of Operation Metro Surge, an immigration operation that kicked off in December 2025 and dispatched thousands of ICE agents to the city. 

The agency recently seized 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Ramos, an Ecuadorian national whom federal officials say is in the U.S. illegally.

The two are being held at a Texas immigration detention facility.

The interaction between Bates and Murtaugh also comes as ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CPB) have faced increased scrutiny following the deaths of two U.S. citizens at the hands of federal agents in Minnesota. 

On Saturday, two CBP agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a Department of Veterans Affairs ICU nurse, while he was recording federal immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis. The agents who fired their weapons at Pretti have been placed on administrative leave in accordance with the agency's procedures, Fox News Digital previously reported.

Pretti's death came weeks after an agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, 37.

The Department of Homeland Security has described both shootings as acts of "self-defense." Deputy Attorney Todd Blanche confirmed Friday in a press conference that the Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into Pretti's death. 

Meanwhile, a majority of voters believe that ICE's immigration tactics are going too far. A new Fox News poll found that 59% of voters believe the agency's immigration efforts are "too aggressive," up from the 49% who said so in July 2025.

The Justice Department says it's releasing more than 3 million pages of documents in the latest Jeffrey Epstein disclosure

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that if any member of Congress would like to see materials in their unredacted form, they can make arrangements with the department to do so.

▶ Follow the latest developments on Friday's release of the Epstein files

NEW YORK (AP) — The Justice Department said Friday that it was releasing many more records from its investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein, resuming disclosures under a law intended to reveal what the government knew about the millionaire financier's sexual abuse of young girls and his interactions with rich and powerful people including Donald Trump and Bill Clinton.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the department was releasing more than 3 million pages of documents in the latest Epstein disclosure, as well as more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images. The files, which were being posted to the department's website, include some of the several million pages of records that officials said were withheld from an initial release of documents in December.

The documents were disclosed under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted after months of public and political pressure that requires the government to open its files on the late financier and his confidant and onetime girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.

“Today's release marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process to ensure transparency to the American people and compliance with the act,” Blanche said at a news conference announcing the disclosure.

The prospect of previously unseen records tying Epstein to famous figures has long animated online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and others who have clamored for a full accounting that even Blanche acknowledged might not be met by the latest document dump.




“There's a hunger, or a thirst, for information that I don't think will be satisfied by review of these documents,” he said.

He insisted that, “We did not protect President Trump. We didn't protect — or not protect — anybody,” Blanche said.

After missing a Dec. 19 deadline set by Congress to release all of the files, the Justice Department said it tasked hundreds of lawyers with reviewing the records to determine what needs to be redacted, or blacked out. 

Among the materials being withheld from release Friday is information that could jeopardize any ongoing investigation or expose the identities of potential victims of sex abuse. All women other than Maxwell have been redacted from videos and images being released Friday, Blanche said.

The number of documents subject to review has ballooned to roughly six million, including duplicates, the department said.

The Justice Department released tens of thousands of pages of documents just before Christmas, including photographs, interview transcripts, call logs and court records. Many of them were either already public or heavily blacked out.

Those records included previously released flight logs showing that Trump flew on Epstein's private jet in the 1990s, before they had a falling out, and several photographs of Clinton. Neither Trump, a Republican, nor Clinton, a Democrat, has been publicly accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and both have said they had no knowledge he was abusing underage girls.

Also released last month were transcripts of grand jury testimony from FBI agents who described interviews they had with several girls and young women who said they were paid to perform sex acts for Epstein.

Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.

In 2008 and 2009, Epstein served jail time in Florida after pleading guilty to soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. At the time, investigators had gathered evidence that Epstein had sexually abused underage girls at his home in Palm Beach, but the U.S. attorney's office agreed not to prosecute him in exchange for his guilty plea to lesser state charges.

In 2021, a federal jury in New York convicted Maxwell, a British socialite, of sex trafficking for helping recruit some of his underage victims. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence at a prison camp in Texas, after being moved there from a federal prison in Florida. She denies any wrongdoing.

U.S. prosecutors never charged anyone else in connection with Epstein's abuse of girls, but one of his victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, accused him in lawsuits of having arranged for her to have sexual encounters at age 17 and 18 with numerous politicians, business titans, noted academics and others, all of whom denied her allegations.

Among the people she accused was Britain's Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor after the scandal led to him being stripped of his royal titles. Andrew denied having sex with Giuffre but settled her lawsuit for an undisclosed sum.

Giuffre died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia last year at age 41.

            Iran is ready to participate in “fair and just” nuclear talks with the United States amid rising tensions between the two nations, but will not be dictated to, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Friday.
    


            “We are under no circumstances willing to accept dictation or imposition,” Araghchi said at a press conference during a visit to Istanbul alongside Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. “Nevertheless, Iran is ready to participate in any diplomatic process that is meaningful, logical and fair.”
    


            It is not clear when or in what format the potential talks could occur. Araghchi said no meeting with the US has been arranged while cautioning that such talks cannot be “conducted under threat.”
    


            He also ruled out the possibility of Tehran engaging in negotiations about what he called Iran's “defensive capabilities,” as well as its missile programme. “I believe no country is prepared to compromise on its own security or its national defence,” he said.
    


            The announcement follows renewed threats from Washington, with US President Donald Trump urging Iran on Wednesday to sign what he called an “equitable” nuclear deal or face another potential US military strike.
    


            Trump said Thursday he's been having conversations with Iranian leaders and is planning on further discussions.
    


            “I have had and I am planning on it,” he said when asked about the status of his conversations with Tehran. “We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn't have to use them.”
    


            Trump did not say to whom he spoke, but he did describe the message he conveyed. “I told them two things,” Trump said. “Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.”
    


            Thousands of demonstrators were killed during recent anti-government protests in Iran after a heavy clampdown by the Iranian regime.
    


            Araghchi said Friday that Iran is “ready to re-enter the nuclear negotiations” while reiterating Tehran's long-standing position that his country's nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.
    


            “The necessary preliminaries must first be established – concerning the format, the venue and the agenda of the discussions,” he added.
    


            During Araghchi's trip to Istanbul, Turkey said it was ready to “assume a facilitating role” between Iran and the US to help de-escalate tensions.
    


            The offer was made in a call between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, the Turkish presidency said.
    


            “The leaders discussed Turkey-Iran bilateral relations and the escalating military tensions in the region,” the Turkish presidency said in a statement Friday.

            On arrival to Istanbul, Araghchi accepted that regional issues are “extremely serious at the moment and we are facing major challenges.”
    


            “The goals stated by the United States and others make it necessary for us to hold closer consultations, review regional developments and coordinate our positions,” Araghchi told reporters.

NEW YORK (AP) — A new front in the battle between California Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Trump administration has opened over a video in which Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz visits Los Angeles and alleges members of its Armenian community orchestrated large-scale health care fraud.

The dayslong public scuffle on social media escalated on Thursday evening, when Newsom announced his office was filing a civil rights complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services accusing Oz of discrimination.

Newsom's office argued in the complaint that Oz “spewed baseless and racially charged allegations” that risked chilling participation in hospice and home care programs among the community targeted. The governor's office noted the claims had “already caused real-world harm” by dampening business at an Armenian bakery that is shown in the video.

Oz and CMS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the complaint or the content of the video, and they haven't publicly shared details that confirm the fraud being alleged.

The video posted on social media earlier this week shows the CMS administrator visiting the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles and pointing to a four-block radius that he says is home to 42 hospices, suggesting potential fraud. He references a business that he says was part of a $16 million fraud scheme. 

Then, while standing in front of a building that includes an Armenian bakery, he alleges that roughly $3.5 billion in hospice and home care fraud has taken place in Los Angeles and “quite a bit of it” was run by “the Russian Armenian mafia.” 




Oz describes the Armenian script on the businesses' signs while the camera pans to the bakery.

“You notice the lettering and language behind me is of that dialect,” says Oz, whose parents emigrated to the U.S. from Turkey. He also claims there “has not been a lot of attention on these problems” in California.

Turkey and Armenia have long been strained by historic grievances and Turkey's alliance with Azerbaijan. The neighboring countries have no formal diplomatic ties, and their joint border has remained closed since the 1990s, though late last year they agreed to simplify visa procedures in an effort to normalize ties.

Newsom disputed the claims in Oz's video and noted on social media that California had revoked more than 280 hospice licenses and banned new licenses starting in 2022 because of concerns about fraud. Then the two leaders exchanged multiple sharp attacks in a back-and-forth on social media.

The feud is among many that have sprung up between Newsom, seen as a potential Democratic presidential candidate for 2028, and the Republican administration of President Donald Trump. Newsom and Trump have clashed over issues ranging from the federal administration's National Guard deployment in Los Angeles to the president's efforts to block California's 2035 ban on new gas-powered cars, a nationwide first.

Oz's video also points to a larger Trump administration effort to spotlight fraud around the country. That effort comes after allegations of fraud involving day care centers run by Somali residents in Minneapolis prompted a massive immigration crackdown in the Midwestern city, resulting in widespread protests. Two people have been fatally shot in the city by federal agents this month.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate leaders were scrambling on Friday to save a bipartisan spending deal and prevent a partial government shutdown this weekend as some Republicans pushed back on a rare deal between President Donald Trump and Democrats. 

Democrats who are demanding new restrictions on federal immigration raids across the country struck an agreement with Trump on Thursday to separate funding for the Department of Homeland Security from a broad government spending bill and give Congress two weeks to debate the issue. That agreement came after irate Democratsthreatened to block the entire spending bill and trigger a shutdown in the wake of the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis. 

Trump said he didn't want a government shutdown and encouraged members of both parties to cast a “much needed Bipartisan ‘YES' vote.” But passage of the package was delayed Friday as some Republican senators pushed back on the deal, warning that Republicans should not give away too much leverage on the border issue. 

ICE agents and Border patrol agents have been “slandered and smeared,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a speech on the Senate floor. “And to the Republican party, where have you been?”

Graham said said he would hold up the deal, for now, unless Republican leaders would give him a vote on his bill preventing local governments from resisting the administration's immigration policies. 




“Guarantee me that vote and we move forward,” Graham said. 

Graham has also opposed House language repealing a new law that gives senators the ability to sue the government for millions of dollars if their personal or office data is accessed without their knowledge.

It was unclear if any Democrats would object. Leaving the Capitol just before midnight on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said there were “snags on both sides” as he and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York tried to work through any objections.

“Hopefully people will be of the spirit to try and get this done” on Friday, when the Senate was scheduled to reconvene in the late morning.

Schumer said Friday morning that “time is of the essence” and “the abuses of ICE have to come to an end.” 

Even if the Senate passes the funding measure, it would need House approval before becoming law. The House is not expected to return until Monday, raising the possibility of at least a temporary partial shutdown over the weekend. 

The Trump administration is expected to issue guidance to federal agencies on how to proceed. 

The unusual bipartisan talks between Trump and Schumer, his frequent adversary, came after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minnesota last weekend and calls by senators in both parties for a full investigation. Schumer called it “a moment of truth.”

“What ICE is doing, outside the law, is state-sanctioned thuggery and it must stop,” Schumer said. “Congress has the authority — and the moral obligation — to act.” 

The standoff has threatened to plunge the country into another shutdown, just two months after Democrats blocked a spending bill over expiring federal health care subsidies. That dispute closed the government for 43 days as Republicans refused to negotiate. 

That shutdown ended when a small group of moderate Democrats broke away to strike a deal with Republicans. But Democrats are more unified this time after the fatal shootings of Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents. 

Republicans were more willing to make a deal, as well. Several said that after those shootings, they were open to new restrictions.

Democrats have laid out several demands, asking the White House to “end roving patrols” in cities and coordinate with local law enforcement on immigration arrests, including requiring tighter rules for warrants.

They also want an enforceable code of conduct so agents are held accountable when they violate rules. Schumer said agents should be required to have “masks off, body cameras on” and carry proper identification, as is common practice in most law enforcement agencies.

Tom Homan, the president's border czar, said Thursday in Minneapolis that federal immigration officials are developing a plan to reduce the number of agents in the state, but that would depend on cooperation from state authorities. 

If the deal moves forward, negotiations down the road on a final agreement on the DHS bill are likely to be difficult. 

Democrats want Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown to end. “If the Trump administration resists reforms, we shut down the agency,” said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal.

Republicans are unlikely to agree to all of the Democrats' demands. 

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C, said he is opposed to requiring immigration enforcement officers to show their faces, even as he blamed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for decisions that he said are “tarnishing” the agency's reputation.

“You know, there's a lot of vicious people out there, and they'll take a picture of your face, and the next thing you know, your children or your wife or your husband are being threatened at home,” Tillis said.

Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., criticized what he called Democrats' “woke wish list of so-called ICE ‘reforms.'” 

“Now, more than EVER, we need to let our police officers know that we have their backs—not burden them with some new protocols that could slow their progress on DEPORTING CRIMINALS,” Tuberville posted on X. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told The Associated Press on Thursday that he had been “vehemently opposed” to breaking up the funding package, but “if it is broken up, we will have to move it as quickly as possible. We can't have the government shut down.”

At a Kennedy Center evening premiere of a movie about first lady Melania Trump, Johnson said he might have some “tough decisions” to make about when to bring the House back to Washington to approve the bills separated by the Senate, if they pass. 

House Republicans have said they do not want any changes to their bill. 

“The package will not come back through the House without funding for the Department of Homeland Security,” members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus wrote Trump.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters that any change in the homeland bill needs to be “meaningful and it needs to be transformative.” 

Absent “dramatic change,” Jeffries said, “Republicans will get another shutdown.”

Federal officials have arrested former CNN host Don Lemon for his presence at a protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a Minnesota church during a Sunday service.

The Thursday evening arrest comes after Lemon said he was there in his capacity as a journalist to report on the protest. He's charged with violating federal law during the event.

On Jan. 18, protesters stormed Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, asserting the pastor was connected to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Protesters began shouting, “ICE out!” Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Friday morning that federal law enforcement arrested four individuals, including Lemon, associated with the protest.

“At my direction, early this morning federal agents arrested Don Lemon, Trahern Jeen Crews, Georgia Fort, and Jamael Lydell Lundy, in connection with the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota,” Bondi said, promising “more details soon” in her post on X.

The Justice Department had dropped its arrest warrant requests for Lemon and several others involved in the protest earlier this week, after federal Magistrate Judge Douglas L. Micko had also previously rejected the charges against Lemon.

After Micko initially rejected the arrest warrants, the DOJ appealed the decision to a higher court, in which Judge Patrick J. Schiltz, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, also refused to take action on the emergency request. Then, the DOJ appealed for a “writ of mandamus” to request a higher court force Schiltz to take action, according to Politico. That panel of judges rejected the emergency decision as well.

Lemon's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, railed against the Thursday arrest in a statement.

“This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand. Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,” Lowell said.

Lowell maintained Lemon's stance that he was doing “constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis,” reporting on the church protest.

“Once the protest started in the church, we did an act of journalism, which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church, and members of the organization,” Lemon said in a recent video posted to social media. “That's it. That's called journalism.”

Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon challenged Lemon's assertion in an interview with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson on Jan. 19.

“Lemon went into the facility, and then he began, ‘committing journalism' as if that's a sort of shield from being a part, an embedded part, of a criminal conspiracy. It isn't,” Dhillon said.

A source familiar with the matter told the Washington Examiner that the arrest occurred in Los Angeles at around 12:30 a.m. Pacific time and that Lemon was charged with conspiracy to deprive rights and a FACE Act violation.

WHAT IS THE FACE ACT? FEDERAL CHARGES FOR MINNESOTA CHURCH PROTEST COULD COME BY SUNDAY

The Justice Department had dropped its arrest warrant requests for Lemon and several others involved in the protest earlier this week, after a Minnesota magistrate judge had also previously rejected the charges against Lemon.

Lemon is now scheduled to appear in a Los Angeles court on Friday morning.

Fox News host Jimmy Failla discusses the ad celebrating "made in America" on "Varney & Co."

Budweiser recently unveiled its patriotic, Americana-themed ad for this year's Super Bowl — with the company once again part of the big game's advertising lineup. This year's "American Icons" commercial commemorates Budweiser's 150th anniversary, according to a news release.

The ad follows a Clydesdale foal that forms a friendship with a young bird. It's a bond that grows between the two over time as Lynyrd Skynyrd's iconic "Free Bird" plays.

"One day, the bird perches on the Clydesdale's back, flapping its wings in an attempt to fly" with help from the horse, the company notes about the spot. "Despite the effort, the bird can't quite fly yet — and nearby farmers, including Brian Fransen, a real-life Budweiser barley farmer, look on, amused by the bond."

In time, as they both grow, the bird is revealed to be a glorious bald eagle as it takes flight from the galloping and now-grown horse's back — resembling the mythical Pegasus. 

"You crying?" one farmer says to the other.

"Nah. Sun's in my eyes," comes the response. 

The spot honors the brand's "deep-rooted American heritage and features the iconic Budweiser Clydesdales in their 48th national appearance on the Super Bowl stage," the company noted in its release.

Todd Allen, senior vice president of marketing for Budweiser, said the brand "knew we had to rise to the occasion in a way only Budweiser can."

He added, "'American Icons' brings our heritage to life through powerful storytelling with the Budweiser Clydesdales and an American bald eagle."

He went on, "This year's spot will leave fans awestruck and proud to enjoy a Budweiser as they celebrate our shared milestone moments."

The 60-second commercial will be shown on the biggest day of the NFL season. 

Fans have already begun posting thoughts about this year's ad. 

One person wrote on X, "Well done, Budweiser. Welcome back to being American."

Another person wrote, "If this doesn't give you chills, you can't call yourself an American!"

Yet another person said, "Dear NFL, could we just cancel the Super Bowl halftime show and watch this repeatedly on the Jumbotron instead? I've never seen a better Budweiser commercial than this one," the individual added.

"Love the colt," wrote another fan on Facebook.

"Best Budweiser commercial ever," someone else gushed. 

"The Budweiser eagle ad is a reminder of what Americana looks like — strength, pride and love for this country," Brian Downey, owner of Downey's Bar & Grill in the Bronx, told Fox News Digital. "It's a nod to the beer drinkers who embody that spirit."

The secret to “looks-maxxing” and saving money? Sardines.﻿

If it feels like your algorithm is being hijacked by tiny, silver fish, you're not just seeing things; sardines are experiencing a cultural moment right now. From influencers showing off snack plates and skin care tips to fitness experts raving about its high protein content, the internet can't stop extolling the benefits of the formerly slept-on, salty snack.

It's a bit like millennials experiencing “bacon-mania” in the 2010s or Gen Z's more recent obsession with olives and pickles. The hype around sardines has gotten so big that some store owners are hiking up prices, citing increased demand and steep tariffs. Longtime sardine consumers have taken to social media to complain about the budget-friendly meal becoming more expensive and naming one culprit, in particular. “Sardines and canned fish in general being randomly expensive now — we hate you, TikTok,” wrote one X user last week.

The current cultural obsession with sardines isn't being driven by memes or even insatiable cravings. It's all about health, beauty, and the Gen Z concept of “-maxxing,” the internet-slang suffix for optimizing a specific area of one's life. It's the appropriately affordable snack for an increasingly unaffordable era that has led young people to invest in their self-improvement when they can't monetarily invest in much else.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Watching social media brag about their sardine consumption feels a bit uncanny. Many of us have gone our entire lives passing up sardines at the supermarket for more mainstream seafood, whether that's canned tuna or something more luxurious, like smoked salmon. If you were raised on sardines, it wasn't exactly the type of meal you would show off during lunchtime. Maybe its most accurate moniker is a struggle food, an involuntary grocery pick for those on a tight budget. That was the case for influencer Ally Renee when she began incorporating them into her diet.

“I always watched my dad eating them growing up,” Renee said. “But I actually got into them by force, because they were like the cheapest thing I could afford in LA.”

Now, she's become a big proponent of sardines on her page, describing it as “skincare in a can” in one of her latest videos. She says she genuinely enjoys the taste of them, but the fact that they're filled with Omega 3's and high in protein is a “win-win.”

“I notice my skin is more bouncy and the texture is a little better,” she said. “When I'm trying to tone up my body, it's such a good source of protein.”

With 28 grams of protein per serving (around the same amount as a lot of pricey protein bars), sardines factor into the current obsession with protein intake and strength training. As a source of omega-3 fatty acids, they may help to reduce inflammation — one of the most-fretted-about medical conditions online — and boost collagen. You'll also see sardines touted online as a way of “looksmaxxing,” “skinmaxxing,” “omega-3-maxxing,” and so on. The objective when eating them is never just to have a good meal, but to be improving your health and appearance at the same time while making the most out of every penny spent.

Kim Severson, a food culture reporter for the New York Times, sees a few other things contributing to the current sardine takeover, including high-end chefs incorporating sardines in their menus and the recent rise in tourism to Portugal, “the land of tinned fish.” She added that we're also witnessing the “snack-ification of America,” where snack plates, girl dinners, and meals entirely made of side dishes have become a popular mode of serving food — and saving money.

“Affordability is a big part of it,” Severson said. “You can eat well with these little snack bites for less.”

The desire to eat well for less has driven a lot of food trends on social media since the pandemic, as people were forced to come up with creative dining options at home and on a budget. A few years ago, the rise of the girl dinner, which is essentially a homemade Lunchable, revolutionized the way many young people thought about healthy, affordable, and aesthetically pleasing food preparation. Self-proclaimed “snack plate girls” even started dedicating their pages to these protein medleys. Grocery prices continued to rise, and the snack plate came into fashion as more people embraced low-effort charcuterie boards. So, it felt appropriate, at the end of last year, when sardines became the centerpiece of many of these viral dishes. TikTok quickly became enamored with the aesthetic of a tin of oven-baked sardines surrounded by tomatoes, pickles, and hard-boiled eggs.

Severson says these sardine snack plates satisfy a “culinary itch” that consumers may not be able to scratch by spending money at fancy restaurants. But it's just one of the ways sardines have become integral to aspirational living on a budget.

What was once a resource for famished soldiers during both world wars and foreign-born workers in the early 20th century has gotten a surprisingly glamorous makeover, thanks to its place in young people's skin care regimes and sophisticated meals. There are even more expensive brands, like Fishwife, which sell “premium” sardines in artful tins with preserved ingredients that have helped boost the image of sardines as luxury.

However, the largely utilitarian function of sardines has seemed to remain intact. While you'll find influencers raving about sardines' briny taste, they've become more of a holy grail for wellness junkies and health nuts than something simply meant to be enjoyed. It shouldn't be so surprising that a highly nutritious but affordable food is speaking to young people from a generation that's hyper-focused on self-improvement and optimization in lieu of abundant job opportunities and wrestling with an economically uncertain future.

Maybe most glaringly, the current sardine obsession falls into a well-documented trend of Gen Z giving the cheapest items value. If they can turn affordable knickknacks into status symbols, why not make a $2 can of sardines the ultimate wellness secret?

PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama's president moved to assure the public on Friday that critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal will continue to operate without interruption — a day after the country's Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings was unconstitutional. 

The court's decision late Thursday advances a U.S. aim to block any influence by China over the strategic waterway and immediately drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing.

Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino said that until the court's ruling is executed — a period of time he did not specify — Panama's Maritime Authority would work with Panama Ports Company, the CK Hutchison subsidiary, to ensure continuing operations at the port. 

Once the concession is formally ended, a local subsidiary of Danish logistics company A.P. Moller-Maersk will operate the ports in a transitional phase until a new concession can be bid and awarded, Mulino said.

“Panama moves forward, its ports will continue operating without interruption and we will continue serving the world at the logistics center of excellence that we are,” Mulino said in a recorded video address.

The court's ruling followed an audit by Panama's comptroller, which alleged irregularities in the 25-year extension of the concession, granted in 2021.

The Trump administration made blocking China's influence over the Panama Canal one of its priorities in the hemisphere. Panama was U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's first overseas stop as the United States' top diplomat. On Friday, Rubio said on X that “the United States is encouraged by the recent Panamanian Supreme Court's decision to rule port concessions to China unconstitutional.”




Despite the insistence by Panama's government and the canal authority that China has no influence over its operations, Rubio made clear that the U.S. viewed the operation of the ports as a national security issue. U.S. President Donald Trump had gone so far as to say Panama should return the canal to U.S. control.

The court's brief statement gave no guidance on what would happen to the ports now.

CK Hutchison's subsidiary, Panama Ports Company, said it has not been notified yet about the decision but insisted its concession was the result of transparent international bidding. 

It said in its statement that the ruling “lacks legal basis and jeopardizes not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity, but also the rule of law and legal certainty in the country.” 

It said that it reserves all rights to proceed legally in Panama or elsewhere, but gave no more details.

The Hong Kong government firmly rejected the ruling in a statement, saying it strongly opposes any foreign government using coercive, repressive or other unreasonable means to seriously harm the business interests of Hong Kong enterprises. It said the Panamanian government should respect the spirit of contracts and provide a fair business environment.

“Given the current situation in Panama, Hong Kong enterprises should carefully review their existing and future investments there,” it said. 

In Beijing, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told reporters that China would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of “the Chinese company,” without elaborating on the potential steps. 

Political analyst Edwin Cabrera said once the parties are notified, the issue of what to do with the ports goes to Panama's executive branch, specifically the Panama Maritime Authority.

“I have the impression from conversations that I have had with some people that the operation (of the ports) will not stop,” Cabrera said.

CK Hutchison Holdings announced a deal last year to sell its majority stake in the Panamanian ports and others around the world to an international consortium that included BlackRock Inc. But the deal appeared to stall over objections by the Chinese government.

The company said last July that it was considering seeking a Chinese investor to join as a significant member of the consortium, a move that some interpreted as way to please Beijing, but CK Hutchison hasn't said more since.

The awkward position the company found itself in highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing's expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing.

Last year, Panama's comptroller audited the concession to the Panama Ports Company, which had held the contract to operate the ports since 1997. The concession was renewed in 2021 for 25 years, during the prior Panamanian administration.

Comptroller Anel Flores said the audit found payments that were not made, accounting errors and the apparent existence of “ghost” concessions operating within the ports since 2015. The company denied those allegations.

The audit determined that the irregularities had cost the government about $300 million since the concession was extended and an estimated $1.2 billion during the original 25-year contract.

Flores also said the extension was granted without the required endorsement of his office.

On July 30, the comptroller challenged the Panama Ports Company's contract to operate the ports before the Supreme Court.

Washington, DC – Leading political figures, celebrities and "cultural iconoclasts" known the world over walked the red carpet at the "MELANIA" world premiere at the Trump Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., on Thursday evening in front of the media and invited guests.

First lady Melania Trump hosted the debut of her new film, which provides an up-close look at her life across 20 days before the inauguration of the 47th president as she and President Donald Trump prepared to return to the White House.

The Supreme Court will soon hear a landmark challenge over precisely who can enjoy the birthright citizenship granted under the 14th amendment, and the Trump administration and its allies are urging the high court to side with the president's view.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 20, 2025, claiming that birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment does not extend to children born on U.S. soil to parents who are in the country illegally or on a temporary basis, such as on a visa. Under the executive order, a child born on U.S. soil who has one parent who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident would still be granted citizenship at birth. Trump's order was challenged by numerous lawsuits, and the Supreme Court agreed to take up a class action lawsuit, titled Trump v. Barbara, in December, after the DOJ appealed multiple cases to the justices.

The Justice Department submitted its brief for arguments to the high court earlier this month, followed by multiple briefs from outside groups supporting the president's side filed this week. In the DOJ's brief, the administration defended the executive order as consistent with the 14th amendment's original intention for citizenship when it was ratified in the 19th century.

“The Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause was adopted to grant citizenship to freed slaves and their children—not to children of temporarily present aliens or illegal aliens,” the DOJ said in its brief to the Supreme Court.

“The Order advances broader efforts to combat the ‘significant threats to national security and public safety' posed by illegal entry and birth tourism,” the brief added. “Henceforth, consistent with the Citizenship Clause's original meaning, the Executive Branch would not treat future children of temporarily present aliens and illegal aliens as U.S. citizens.”

Various groups and lawmakers offered their friend-of-the-court briefs in favor of upholding the Trump administration's executive order this week. The Coolidge Reagan Foundation, a right-leaning group, argued in its brief that the Supreme Court “should not allow one of the most important issues of the twenty-first century to be resolved as a matter of constitutional law by accident.”

“This Court should not construe this provision to inadvertently resolve the fundamentally different challenge of systemic illegal immigration in the face of the modern welfare state more than a century later without any public debate or deliberation,” the Coolidge Reagan Foundation's brief said.

“The Court should not grant the millions of illegal aliens whose continued presence in this country violates federal law the constitutional power to change the American political community—the electorate—by conferring citizenship upon their children,” the brief continued.

A group of Republican-led states, led by Tennessee and Iowa, also filed a brief supporting the Trump administration's stance, stressing that the influx of illegal immigrants into the U.S. in recent years has overwhelmed the states filing the brief – along with the rest of the country – and that the longstanding assumption that children of illegal immigrants are due birthright citizenship is “seriously mistaken.”

The coalition states argued that the text of the 14th Amendment, debate around the creation of the amendment, and the Supreme Court's previous holdings, all favor the Trump administration's view of birthright citizenship.

“Contra plaintiffs' thin historical arguments, contemporaneous sources instead support what common sense suggests: Conferring United States citizenship requires a more meaningful connection than mere presence by happenstance or illegality. That connection, originalist evidence repeatedly instructs, was parental domicile,” the coalition of states said.

The briefs from group of people whose children could be affected by the order and their supporters are expected to be submitted to the high court in the coming weeks.

The oral arguments in Trump v. Barbara are expected to be one of the most closely watched of the term, as one of the president's signature executive orders undergoes Supreme Court scrutiny. The high court has yet to schedule oral arguments in the case, but it is expected the justices will hear the case in March or April.

A decision in Trump v. Barbara is expected by the end of June, when the high court releases its final rulings on its current term.

            President Donald Trump said Friday he is nominating Kevin Warsh to be the 17th chair of the Federal Reserve after Jerome Powell's term ends in May.
    


            “I am pleased to announce that I am nominating Kevin Warsh to be the CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, Trump wrote on his social media platform on Friday morning. “I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best.”
    


            In an Oval Office meeting later Friday, Trump further touted his pick, saying: “I would say that this was the perfect candidate. This was the man that's most qualified, top student, best schools, everything was perfect, the youngest person ever to serve on the Fed. Got the whole package. Looks don't mean anything, but he's got the look, right?”
    


            Warsh is a somewhat conventional candidate for Fed chair: a former Fed governor who was previously under consideration to be Treasury secretary in Trump's second term and was a candidate for the top job at the Fed during Trump's first term. Warsh was appointed to the Fed in 2006 at the age of 35, making him the youngest person to have ever served on the Fed's powerful board.
    


            Warsh, now 55, has recently shifted his stance on monetary policy. A former inflation hawk, Warsh now favors lower interest rates, according to numerous public statements he's made in recent months as Trump launched a reality-show-like spectacle for his Fed chair decision. He's also called for overhauling the central bank's workforce.
    


            “It's reasonable to assume that he told the President he favors reducing interest rates today, otherwise he would not have been nominated,” wrote Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in commentary issued Friday. “Our instincts tell us Mr. Warsh will be more preoccupied with how history will view his record than with continuing to pander to the President.”
    


            Selecting a new Fed chair is one of the most important hires any president makes – but the nomination takes on even greater importance under this president. Trump has vowed to drive down the cost of living, and the Fed is responsible for maintaining price stability.
    


            Trump has railed against the Fed and Powell for the past year, berating Powell, his handpicked Fed chair, for not cutting rates. Earlier this month, Powell revealed in an extraordinary video statement that the Trump administration has launched a criminal investigation into the Fed and its chair. In his extraordinary rebuke, Powell said the move was a “pretext” to intimidate the central bank to lower rates to the president's liking.
    


            It's been no secret that Trump has been unhappy with Powell, though it's not clear he has the authority to actually fire him. However, Trump waved a termination letter in front of a group of House Republicans at an Oval Office meeting in August, according to three people familiar with the matter.
    


            Meanwhile, the Trump administration is actively arguing before the Supreme Court why it should proceed with removing Fed Governor Lisa Cook, whom the president said he fired in August. The Fed's independence is at stake in the landmark case, but conservative Justices were already skeptical about the administration's legal reasoning in oral arguments earlier this month.



Trump names his pick to replace Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve



            Trump's choice for central bank head caps off an extensive search process that at one point considered about a dozen people, from MAGA fixtures such as National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett to even former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, according to Scott Bessent, Trump's Treasury chief, who led the search. Bessent himself was also under consideration for the role but told Trump he'd prefer to remain in his current position.
    


            In addition to Warsh, the final four candidates were National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock's Rick Rieder.
    


            “Christopher Waller, Rick Rieder, and others, were interviewed for the Fed position. They all would have been outstanding, and have a great and unlimited future with “TRUMP.” Such amazing talent in our Country. Thank you!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday.
    


            Hassett would have been “a great Chairman,” Trump noted in a separate post. “But, quite honestly, he is doing such an outstanding job working with me and my team at the White House, that I just didn't want to let him go. Kevin is indescribably good so, as the expression goes, ‘if you can't do better, don't try to fix it!'”
    


            The Senate Banking Committee will consider Warsh's nomination through a public hearing, then the broader Senate chamber will vote on whether or not to confirm him. But even that process may be tainted by the Trump administration's extraordinary criminal investigation of Powell, a red line that some key Republican senators said Trump crossed that could hold up Warsh's nomination until the investigation draws to a close.
    


            “No Republican purporting to care about Fed independence should agree to move forward with this nomination until Trump drops his witch hunts of the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve and Governor Lisa Cook,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic member of the committee, said in a statement Friday.
    


            Trump's efforts to politicize the Fed's decisions have threatened to undermine the central bank's prized independence. Members of the Senate Banking Committee will almost certainly ask Warsh about his shifting policy on interest rates and any potential promises he made to Trump about setting policy.
    


            He may also get questions about his father-in-law, Republican mega-donor Ronald Lauder. In 2002, Warsh married cosmetics billionaire heiress and businesswoman Jane Lauder, granddaughter of Estée Lauder. They met at Stanford.
    


Jerome Powell's remarkable advice to his successor speaks volumes about his battle with Trump



            Warsh worked as a White House economist in the George W. Bush administration. He is currently a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative-leaning think tank at Stanford University.
    


            Although Trump is seeking deep interest rate cuts to turbo-charge US growth, some economists and analysts note that Warsh once had a track record of pushing back against policies that stimulate the economy.
    


            For instance, in April 2009 during the middle of the Great Recession when the unemployment rate was surging, Warsh expressed concern about inflation.
    


            “I continue to be more worried about upside risks to inflation than downside risks,” Warsh said during a Fed meeting, according to minutes that were later released. His own reason for resigning from the Fed in 2011 also underscores his aversion to loose monetary policy — at least before he was in the running for Fed chair this time around.
    


            “Kevin Warsh has been a monetary policy hawk his entire career and most importantly, during a time when the labor markets fell out of bed. His dovishness today stems from convenience,” analysts at Renaissance Macro Research posted on X Friday. “The President risks getting duped.”
    


            Warsh is seen in economic and financial circles as an experienced and serious policy figure with a deep resume. As a young Fed governor, he played a key role managing the financial crisis alongside then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and former New York Fed President Timothy Geithner, who later became Treasury secretary.
    


            However, he has shown he can be independent in the past: He stepped away from the central bank due to policy disagreements about the crisis-management tools the Fed used after the Great Financial Crisis. He was critical of quantitative easing, or large purchases of Treasury bonds to help lower long-term interest rates, saying later that such moves risked pushing up inflation and brought the Fed outside its core mandate.
    


            “He got the policy response wrong in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis,” Joe Brusuelas told CNN on Thursday. “He truly did not understand the nature, magnitude and implications of the Depression-like shock that occurred.”
    


            “During the defining crisis of our time – the Great Financial Crisis – Kevin Warsh continued to extoll inflation as the primary risk during 2007-08 as a massively deflationary event was unleashed via the near collapse of the American banking sector and freezing up of credit markets that ensued.”

Fox News Digital explores the day of the killing of Alex Pretti.

The anti-ICE mobilization that unfolded around the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last week mirrored the methods used to overthrow governments and spark bloody revolutions around the globe, according to a Fox News Digital analysis.

Encrypted Signal chats, command-and-control centers, rapid-response propaganda and orchestrated tear-gas clashes with law enforcement have served to mobilize forces and manipulate public opinion in the ongoing conflict. Close analysis of guidelines distributed online by anti-ICE groups and the minute-by-minute events surrounding the Pretti's death reveal tactics and strategy well-known to military and intelligence analysts as the elements of global insurgencies.

"The violence and rebellion that we're seeing on the streets of Minneapolis is like an insurgency," said Rick de la Torre, a retired CIA senior operations officer and chief of station.

De la Torre, who has tracked insurgency groups globally from Afghanistan to the Philippines for 20 years, told Fox News Digital he believes the effort is being directed and funded from overseas.

"All of the evidence I've seen indicates to me that the insurgency is funded by foreign adversaries who want to see violence and Americans fighting each other," said de la Torre, now founder of Tower Strategies, an advisory firm based in Washington, D.C.

"The violence and rebellion that we're seeing on the streets of Minneapolis is like an insurgency."

Core U.S. government manuals, such as the "CIA Guide to the Analysis of Insurgency" and the U.S. Army's "Insurgencies and Countering Insurgencies," describe how decentralized movements embed within civilian populations, rely on rapid communications, exploit triggering events and sustain momentum through logistics, narrative control and persistent surveillance of their perceived adversaries.

In the case of the anti-ICE network, many of the organizations involved are self-described Marxist-Leninists, with the ANSWER Coalition, the People's Forum, the Party for Socialism and Liberation and BreakThrough News funded by an American-born tech tycoon, Neville Roy Singham, living in Shanghai supporting the communist regime that runs the People's Republic of China.

"What these groups are trying to do is destroy everything that makes America great: our history, our belief systems, our freedoms, our family unit, our self, our religion, everything. In their minds, all that has to be destroyed so that the system they want to bring about can be progressed," said de la Torre. "That means the end of free enterprise and America as we know it."

Across anti-ICE guides circulated in Minnesota, several recurring tactical elements parallel those insurgency tactics with a clear "command and control" of the operation, another feature of insurgencies:

"The usage of hi-tech equipment, communications, the tactics they employ to track individuals, to break things up into zones, to have a chain of command. Someone is in charge of communications, someone is in charge of moving people, someone is in charge of even medical help. This is all textbook violent revolution," de la Torre said. 

VIDEO APPEARS TO SHOW ALEX PRETTI SPIT AT FEDERAL AGENTS, VIOLENTLY DAMAGE SUV DAYS BEFORE FATAL CBP SHOOTING

A new video by the News Movement captured Pretti cursing and spitting at federal agents on Jan. 13, 11 days before his death, as they arrived at a street corner. He kicked out a rear bumper light on the agents' SUV before a federal agent jumped out and tackled him as ICE Watch "rapid responders" blew whistles, took videos and cursed at agents. What appeared to be a gun was visible in the waistband of Pretti, who was carrying a handgun when his fatal encounter with Border Patrol agents occurred.

"This is not Martin Luther King sitting at a café counter," said de La Torre. "They didn't throw things at cops. They didn't bite cops or yell or blow whistles. They politely smiled and allowed themselves to get arrested. That's peaceful protesting. What we're seeing is violent insurrection. And we're seeing violent insurrection promoted by many members of the Democratic Party. They know this."

JONATHAN TURLEY: DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS ARE RISKING LIVES WITH RECKLESS ANTI-ICE RHETORIC

A timeline of events surrounding Pretti's killing illustrates how those tactics were implemented in real time and how the incident functions as a window into a broader tactical strategy.

What happened: At 8:45 a.m, ICE Watch "rapid responders" added the first license plate and movement of suspected ICE vehicles and agents in an "MN ICE Plate" database. Reports continued throughout the day, revealing the sustained monitoring of their work.

ICE Watch tactic: The guides formalize patrol roles, including "foot patrol," "dispatch" and "mobile patrol / commuter," which is designed by the car and air 🚗💨 emojis. Mobile units have core tasks of license plate collection and vehicle pattern tracking.

Insurgency doctrine parallel: Military doctrine describes irregular networks as relying heavily on "pattern-of-life" intelligence, systematically tracking adversary movements to anticipate, disrupt and publicize government activity.

LIBERAL SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM BLUESKY FLOODED WITH USERS CALLING FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST ICE AGENTS

What happened: A Signal user, "Willow," posted a 22-second video from inside Glam Doll Donuts, followed by messages reading "26and 3rd" and "Outside Glam Doll," documenting federal agents at Glam Doll Donuts on Nicollet Avenue. The day before, Glam Doll Donuts had closed its shop for business to join a protest, "ICE OUT OF MINNESOTA." In the video, someone shouted, "Get out of here!" to the federal agents.

ICE Watch tactic: The "Best Practices Guide for Neighborhood or Area Patrol / Monitors: 612" stresses the use of Signal group calls for live, on-scene reporting.

Insurgency doctrine parallel: Intelligence manuals note that insurgencies depend on dense local networks and rapid information dissemination to shape perceptions and mobilize supporters, often by exploiting a "population's concerns and grievances."

Border Patrol was reportedly involved in a shooting in South Minneapolis on Saturday, January 24, 2026. The suspect was allegedly armed with a gun and two magazines. (DHS)

What happened: Another Signal user, "Salacious B. Crumb," escalated the alert, sending the message: "Backup needed at the Black Forest Inn parking lot on Nicollet Ave just south of 26th Street," by Glam Doll Donuts, adding: "One confirmed ICE vehicle seen was a maroon Dodge Durango."

ICE Watch tactic: The 612 guide coordinates "Dispatch - Live on the Monitor / Patrol group" with the ☎ emoji to alert members to heightened federal agent movements.

Insurgency doctrine parallel: Military analysts note that effective insurgent movements maintain something called "command and control" despite decentralization, relying on communications discipline and pre-assigned roles rather than formal hierarchies.

What happened: Pretti and other anti-ICE activists stepped into the middle of Nicollet Avenue to direct traffic outside Glam Doll Donuts, with fellow anti-ICE agitators blowing whistles to alert locals that ICE officers were around. 

ICE Watch tactic: The manuals explicitly describe the use of whistles and horns as rapid, low-tech alert systems to activate surrounding community members and draw attention to federal activity.

Insurgency doctrine parallel: Such immediate, visible mobilization aligns with "rapid response" techniques described in insurgency literature, where "triggering events" are used to quickly activate local populations.

What happened: At least one federal agent shot Alex Pretti outside Glam Doll Donuts on Nicollet Avenue, killing him.

ICE Watch tactic: Manuals have been updated to direct members of ICE Watch patrols to avoid direct confrontation with law enforcement authorities, but the back-room message has been to instigate confrontations that can then be filmed and turned into propaganda for the effort.

Insurgency doctrine parallel: Military manuals emphasize that "kinetic actions" – or violent, physical and lethal actions – involving government forces often become catalytic moments and symbolic events that can be leveraged to accelerate mobilization and escalate a narrative of state-sponsored cruelty.

What happened: The signal network erupted with an urgent red-phone alert: "☎️URGENT: observers urgently requested at glam doll donuts @ 26th & nicollet. an observer has been shot by ice, unknown condition, emts present, please be safe. EDIT: medics requested to join perimeter in case agents start gassing."

ICE Watch tactic: The guides instruct members to rapidly summon medics, establish perimeters and prepare for anticipated law-enforcement countermeasures such as gas deployment.

Insurgency doctrine: The U.S. Army manual emphasizes the importance of the "information environment" immediately after violence, noting that logistics, medical support and messaging function as force multipliers for sustained irregular activity.

What happened: BreakThrough News, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and propaganda arm of the People's Forum, the ANSWER Coalition and the Party for Socialism and Liberation, posted a video of the killing, filmed from inside Glam Doll Donuts, calling it "Another CBP Shooting…" It's been funded by tech tycoon, Singham, living in China.

ICE Watch tactic: The field guides dedicate entire sections to cultural production, media engagement and rapid narrative dissemination following high-profile incidents.

Insurgency doctrine: Military analysts describe propaganda and imagery as core tools for shaping perceptions, reinforcing in-group identity and portraying government actions as illegitimate or repressive.

MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER: THE LEFT IS GETTING PEOPLE KILLED

What happened: The Party for Socialism and Liberation published a poster on social media, saying, "CPB MURDERS ANOTHER IN MINNEAPOLIS," with the message, "EXPAND THE GENERAL STRIKE!"

ICE Watch tactic: The ICE Watch manuals include workplace-focused tactics and "non-cooperation," including ways to sabotage ICE activities and engage in noncompliance. 

Insurgency doctrine: U.S. Army guidance identifies economic disruption and government paralysis as classic insurgent strategies designed to demonstrate power and force concessions.

What happened: The People's Forum posted an "EMERGENCY PROTEST" call for 4 p.m. ET in NYC.

ICE Watch tactic: The guides emphasize "city-wide/state-wide coordination" and "rapid response networks" through shared platforms like Signal and Action Network to rapidly scale actions beyond the original incident location.

Insurgency doctrine: Experts say effective insurgency movements synchronize "distributed nodes," like cells and chapters, to create the appearance – and reality – of momentum across multiple boundaries.

What happened: Democratic Socialists of America posted a graphic calling the killing an "execution" and demanding "ABOLISH ICE NOW."

ICE Watch tactic: The manuals stress narrative shaping and mass communication that results in "consciousness-raising" and expanding resistance into "every home and every block."

Insurgency doctrine: Counterinsurgency doctrine describes this as a "legitimacy contest" with competing claims intended to erode confidence in government forces and institutions.

What happened: The Party for Socialism and Liberation and other socialist, Marxist-Leninist and communist groups asserted that Pretti was "murdered" and declared later, "We will continue the struggle for justice in his memory!"

ICE Watch tactic: Sustaining morale through messages of reaffirmation is repeatedly emphasized in the manuals.

Insurgency doctrine: Experts note that martyr narratives and "commitment signaling" are used to sustain recruitment, cohesion and risk tolerance.

What happened: Signal alerts continued into the following day, including reports of "2 confirmed ICE vehicles… at least 2 agents in each vehicle," indicating ongoing surveillance and situational awareness well after the initial incident.

ICE Watch tactic: The license-plate tracker, vehicle identification guides and persistent patrol roles are designed for long-duration monitoring rather than one-off responses.

Insurgency doctrine: Intelligence manuals describe sustained surveillance as a defining feature of mature insurgent networks, enabling anticipation of government actions and reinforcing the perception of omnipresent resistance.

Megan Mauro of the Texas Business Association tells Fox News Digital that low taxes and light regulation are key drivers of business migration to the Lone Star State.

Everything's bigger in Texas — including its economy. And it's not just because more people are moving there.

Strip out population growth and Texas is generating thousands of dollars more per resident than it did just three years ago.

That kind of growth matters politically. It signals rising living standards, a stronger tax base and greater leverage to fund infrastructure, education and other priorities without raising taxes. Texas' success story gives Republicans a clear example to argue that low taxes, light regulation and strong energy production deliver real economic advantages, not just population churn.

Those gains show up clearly in the data. The Lone Star State saw a 10.1% increase in economic output on a per-capita basis from 2021 to 2024, based on calculations using Bureau of Economic Analysis and U.S. Census figures.

CALIFORNIA'S LOOMING CAPITAL FLIGHT PROBLEM COULD RESHAPE STATE IN 3 KEY AREAS

In dollar terms, Texas boosted economic output per resident from roughly $64,000 to nearly $71,000. Even states with far larger economies, including California, didn't see the same growth per person, with California's rising far more modestly, from about $80,000 to $84,000.

Looking at growth for residents helps distinguish economies that are truly getting stronger from those that are simply getting bigger. Texas falls firmly in the former camp, undercutting the argument that its rise is merely a demographic mirage.

Even within the fast-growing Sun Belt, Texas outpaces peers like Florida and Arizona, which also benefit from migration but posted smaller per-resident gains. 

That distinction carries political weight heading into 2026.

With the midterm election cycle approaching, Texas' per-resident gains give Republicans a concrete way to argue that their policy mix delivers stronger growth as Democrats push for a larger federal role.

Everything may be bigger in Texas — but the data suggest its economy is also getting stronger.

Federal models keep missing homes that burn. A new AI tool zooms in.

A lot of us might assume that most homes that are destroyed by wildfires were in obvious, high fire-risk areas, like on the edge of forests that frequently burn. But wildfires are a faster-growing and much closer threat than we may realize — burning in places that rarely used to see them.

For instance, many homes that remain in the neighborhoods that burned in the historic Los Angeles wildfires last year are still considered as having “low risk” in assessments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) despite the charred remains of their neighbors showing how vulnerable they might be to embers blowing from miles away.

It raises an urgent question: Do we actually know which homes face the most danger of burning?

Government risk maps are too coarse for the way wildfire works now. But new tools powered by AI are giving us a clearer picture. They could reshape how we understand the dangers that lie ahead and force a reckoning over where we live and how we build and protect our homes — if we choose to listen.

For decades, modelers calculated wildfire risk by looking at historical patterns of wildfires, but it's increasingly evident that this vastly understates the scope of the problem. In fact, until 2023, California prohibited insurers from using forward-looking catastrophe models that included factors like future climate change to set their rates. “Wildfires have very complex dynamics, and a backward-looking approach is not sufficient,” said Firas Saleh, director of North America wildfire models at Moody's, a financial analytics firm.

Now, one company, ZestyAI, says they have a new model that fills in “blind spots” in the government's fire risk calculations, providing a sharper picture of the threats wildfires can pose to individual homes.

“Early on in our journey, we realized that insurance companies were writing property insurance without having a deep understanding of the properties themselves,” said Kumar Dhuvur, chief product officer at ZestyAI. “A lot of times, their way to get that understanding was to ask agents or the homeowners, ‘Hey, do you have a tree next to your house? Do you have a swimming pool?'”

To produce their estimates, ZestyAI used satellite images of neighborhoods to examine structures, vegetation, and terrain. They combined this information along with historical fire records and climate variables to train their AI model. This allowed them to calculate risks for specific houses.

“You've got to be very granular in your assessment of risk,” Dhuvur said. “There could be whole neighborhoods where the resolution is too low and becomes a no-go zone for an insurance company.”

When using its model to analyze the regions burned in Los Angeles wildfires last year, for example, ZestyAI found that more than 3,000 properties that were labeled as low or no risk in assessments from FEMA showed up as having an elevated fire risk in ZestyAI's model. These properties have an estimated value of $2.4 billion. Across California, there are 1.2 million properties worth around $940 billion that were labeled as low risk in FEMA's National Risk Index. ZestyAI found all of them to face greater danger.

It's an alarming result when you put it in the greater context. Sprawling, destructive wildfires are extracting a massive and growing toll from the global economy. In 2025, fires around the world burned through 390 million hectares — more than 90 percent of the land area of all the countries in the European Union. The price tag of wildfires has been surging in recent decades, and the Los Angeles wildfires last year may be the most expensive disaster in US history.

This is a big jump forward from conventional fire risk models.

FEMA's National Risk Index, for example, calculates threats over census tracts or counties (The National Risk Index has now been migrated into the new Resilience Analysis and Planning Tool). The dataset groups high-risk and low-risk homes together in ways that miss a lot of important differences between them. Some houses may have fire-resistant shingles and a wide defensible space that give them more protection. Others may have shared wooden fences with neighbors that create pathways for fire to travel, leaving those homes vulnerable to fires that start far away.

That was clear in the aftermath of the Los Angeles fires, when some homes were left standing despite just about the rest of the neighborhood turning to ash.

For its part, the Federal Emergency Management Agency told Vox that the National Risk Index is intended to be a baseline, not an absolute measure of risk.

“FEMA welcomes efforts by others to develop additional datasets that support communities in preparing for all hazards, including wildfires,” a FEMA spokesperson wrote in an email. “Increased research and data collection on risks enables communities to enhance their preparedness and resilience before disasters happen.”

But even though ZestyAI's analysis provides a clearer picture of which homes are in danger, it can still leave some important complexities of wildfires, said Hussam Mahmoud, who leads the Vanderbilt Center for Sustainability, Energy and Climate and studies risks to communities.

Fire risk is not just a function of individual homes but of how whole neighborhoods and environments interact. A group of homeowners might clear a wide defensible space around their own homes, upgrade their sidings, and protect attic vents from cinders, but if one of their neighbors falls short, it could endanger the whole community when flames arrive. Even fire-resistant homes that meet upgraded construction codes can burn if they are pummeled for hours with waves of embers on hurricane-force winds, as the 2025 Los Angeles fires showed.

“I think AI is a very promising technology,” Mahmoud said. “It has limitations to how it can be used with a physics-based model.”

There are also tradeoffs between how precise risk estimates can be and how much they cost. Inspecting individual homes in person can yield the sharpest picture, but it's intrusive, time-consuming, and expensive to send people to examine millions of homes. And in-person inspections still don't tell the whole story.

“When you're on the ground assessing buildings and looking if the building has good roof material versus good siding versus something else, you're assuming that this building is a recipient of fire,” Mahmoud said. “You're not looking at how the fire is propagating across the community.”

The story we tell about wildfires is shifting. They are not just a problem in wilderness areas that happen to spill over into cities and neighborhoods. Houses are now as much a part of the landscape as pine trees and chaparral. They are both fuels and sources of ignition, even far from forests and shrublands. The vast majority of wildfires are ignited by human activity, and when entire neighborhoods ignite, fires behave in hard-to-predict ways not seen in nature. That was evident as the Los Angeles fires last year engulfed coastal mansions in Pacific Palisades and entire neighborhoods in downtown Altadena.

But better models like ZestyAI's can make a difference — if we're willing to make hard decisions and act on them.

Some communities have already used specialized fire forecasts to target certain properties with mitigation measures to reduce their odds of igniting and then leveraging that to lower their insurance rates. And with regulatory reforms like allowing insurers to use fire models that look ahead, California is starting to lure some insurance companies back to the state.

The biggest challenge may yet be getting people to acknowledge their risks at all.

The home listing site Zillow last year decided to remove climate risk scores from property listings under pressure from California real estate groups that complained that the scores were hurting the resale value of some homes. It makes sense: A better map of fire dangers might not be in your interest if you're trying to sell your home and its value suddenly drops because it shows up as having a higher risk of igniting. An insurance company might also use that information to raise your premiums or drop your coverage entirely.

There are more reasons why people might not want to think too hard about future fires. Faced with an urgent housing shortage, Los Angeles is under immense pressure to build as much as possible, as fast as possible. Yet despite all the efforts to speed up construction, especially in the wake of the devastating wildfires last year, building in Southern California is still an agonizingly slow process.

Anyone with money and time who has lost their home in a fire can afford to wait to assess their risks and rebuild their homes to be more resilient, or move. However, many lower-income fire victims don't have a choice other than to try to go back to the same conditions that put them in danger in the first place. That's part of why there have been more permit applications to date for rebuilding in low and middle-income communities — like Altadena, for example — that burned last year, and fewer in wealthier enclaves like Pacific Palisades.

“Families that are displaced from Palisades do have the wealth and means to look for alternatives as opposed to Altadena residents, for whom that's their only option,” said Minjee Kim, an assistant professor of urban planning at the University of California Los Angeles.

AI and more advanced models can help us predict these risks and understand them better, but no algorithm can extinguish financial denial or do the political heavy lifting required to stop us from building tomorrow's homes in burn zones that are only getting bigger.

Fox News legal editor Kerri Urbahn joins 'America's Newsroom' to react to social media companies facing trial over allegations that their platforms are defective products intentionally designed to cause addiction in children.

For over a decade, child victims and their parents have been denied the chance to get justice for the harms they have suffered from social media's products–ranging from anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance use disorders, suicide, sextortion, and, in the starkest cases, death. Starting this week, they will finally have their day in court. 

On Tuesday, the first bellwether trial against social media companies began in Los Angeles, serving as the initial test case for many more pending lawsuits. Meta, TikTok, Snap and YouTube face more than 3,000 lawsuits in California alone, along with more than 2,000 additional cases in federal court. 

Startling evidence is already coming to light. One internal Meta employee message exchange compares Instagram to drugs and slot machines. "Oh my gosh yall IG is a drug," "Lol, I mean, all social media. We're basically pushers." 

FRENCH LAWMAKERS DECLARE 'BATTLE FOR FREE MINDS' AFTER APPROVING SOCIAL MEDIA BAN FOR CHILDREN UNDER 15

This is a landmark case. Never before have we been able to see this evidence, to reach this stage of litigation with social media where courts, and the public, can finally see for themselves the choices these companies have made when it comes to minors.

For years, any lawsuits brought against social media companies were dismissed outright because of a law from 1996 called Section 230 that gives internet platforms immunity for harm caused by third-party content they host. But this new wave of cases takes a novel approach: Rather than alleging that harm to the victims was caused by the content victims were exposed to, they argue that harm was caused by the product design features of the companies themselves. 

These lawsuits do not blame bad content or "too much screen time," dismantling the idea that parents are to blame for allowing kids to be online too much. Instead, they claim the defendants engineered their platforms to be addictive and failed to warn users about their addictive potential.

The features designed to foster addiction that are at issue include infinite scroll, autoplay, recommendation algorithms that send minors down rabbit holes, push notifications and "likes," all of which create addictive dopamine-driven feedback loops to keep a user engaged for as long as possible. 

Parents are fighting back because Washington didn't. Congress hasn't passed a child online safety law since 1998, nearly a decade before social media even existed.

As with the massive litigation against tobacco companies in the late 1990s and opioid manufacturers more recently, the key question for the jury to decide in this social media trial is straighforward: Did these companies negligently design and market a highly addictive product to children and did they know — and fail to warn users—-that their products cause harms to minors? 

Critics of the social media lawsuits argue that these cases don't belong in court – claiming that it is too difficult for victims to prove causation of their harms from social media, given the complex interplay of personal experience, personality and online exposure.

Similar arguments, however, were also made in the past against bringing lawsuits against Big Tobacco or opioid producers. Critics argued that people fall into addiction for all kinds of reasons, and therefore companies weren't to blame. But we know how those massive litigations turned out: multibillion-dollar settlements from Big Tobacco and the pharma companies to hundreds of thousands of plaintiffs who were harmed by their products. These social media suits appear to be on that same path. 

The evidence speaks for itself. Newly unsealed documents provide smoking-gun evidence that Meta, Google, Snap and TikTok all purposefully designed their social media products to addict children and teens and that youth addiction was an intentional part of their business models. 

The documents include internal discussions among company employees, presentations from internal meetings, and their own research studies. One exhibit of an internal report from Meta states that "the lifetime value of a 13 y/o teen is roughly $270 per teen." Another Meta report says, "the young ones are the best ones" in explaining how young users have greater long-term retention for the company in using their products.

These companies quantified our children and their attention to maximize their profit value, all while knowing their products were harming minor users. Results of a Meta internal study on teen mental health found that "Teens can't switch off from Instagram even if they want to" and that "Teens talk of Instagram in terms of an ‘addict's narrative' spending too much time indulging in a compulsive behavior that they know is negative but feel powerless to resist." 

Meta and these other platforms allowed our children to be harmed and said nothing. Now the public will finally know.

Unsurprisingly, two of the four companies in this first trial, Snap and TikTok, both settled before the proceedings began. These companies don't want damning internal evidence that they knew their products were harming children, and they did nothing to change the design or warn users, to come to light. Nevertheless, parents and teens will finally have their day in court.

Parents are fighting back because Washington didn't. Congress hasn't passed a child online safety law since 1998, nearly a decade before social media even existed. Whereas Australia has recently passed a social media ban for minors under 16, with France and the UK proposing the same. In the United States, parents and states are the ones stepping in to the void to hold the social media companies accountable through the courts. If Congress won't do it, parents will. 

This trial is the tobacco moment for Big Tech.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem explained the reasoning behind her previous statements regarding the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, in which she referred to him as a “domestic terrorist,” during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. Noem said she relied on the “best information” that was available at the time and sent to her from agents and officers who were present during the shooting. 

“That situation was very chaotic,” said Noem. “We were being relayed information from on the ground from CBP agents and officers that were there. We were using the best information we had at the time, seeking to be transparent toward the American people and get them what we knew to be true on the ground.”

Noem's comments come as the Trump administration has altered its original tone and strategies in Minnesota after the fatal shooting. First, there was the revelation that border czar Tom Homan would now lead illegal immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota. Then presidential adviser Stephen Miller revealed that agents in the state may have broken protocol during operations. Meanwhile, Noem said on Thursday the current FBI investigation of Pretti's shooting would ensure “the American people know the truth of the situation.”

“We will continue to follow the investigation that the FBI is leading and giving them all the information that they need to bring that to conclusion and make sure the American people know the truth of the situation and how we can go forward and continue to protect the American people,” Noem said.

Hannity pressed Noem on her past use of the phrase “domestic terrorism” when commenting on the shootings of Renee Good and Pretti.

“People seem to be upset over the term ‘domestic terrorism.' Why do you believe that's appropriate, because you used it in both cases?” Hannity asked. 

Noem mentioned the FBI investigation would be important in how the situation is discussed. She then pivoted to discussing the root of why Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations have occurred, mentioning the surge of “unvetted” illegal immigrants entering the country during the Biden administration. 

“We're continuing to gather information, and the FBI leading this investigation is important to make sure we talk about both of these situations appropriately,” Noem said. “In the Renee Good situation, we have more information as it happened previously, and we'll continue to get to the truth of all of this. But we can't distract from the fact of how we got here, and we got here because we had a Biden administration that allowed an invasion over our southern border and allowed millions of people to come into our country unvetted.”

“And we know for a fact that we had dangerous criminals and drug traffickers, murderers, terrorists, people on the suspected and known-terrorist watchlist, that are in this country, that these officers are working so hard to get off of our streets,” Noem said.

Hannity also asked Noem if there were “any lessons to be learned” from the Pretti shooting. Noem replied that she is committed to daily improvement and that, along with DHS, she can “always do better.”

“We believe that we can always do better, and we seek to do that every single day,” Noem said. “And we want to make sure that we not only improve protocols on the ground in chaotic and volatile situations like this, but that we continue to find the truth around this situation and get the facts to the American people and make sure that we continue to do our work every day with integrity.” 

RUBIO SIDESTEPS MINNEAPOLIS QUAGMIRE FROM SECRETARY OF STATE POST WITH 2028 LOOMING

Noem also emphasized that the DHS would stay the course and continue to “get criminals and dangerous people off the streets like these officers have been for months, ever since President Trump came back into office.”

She also lauded the courage of federal law enforcement officers as they continue to do their jobs in such challenging situations and a tenuous political climate.

“They take an oath to go out and protect these communities and to keep them safe, and that's one of the jobs that they take very seriously, especially in Minneapolis, as we've seen this kind of violent riots go forward and attack them,” Noem said.

            Panama's Supreme Court ruled late Thursday that the concession held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings to operate ports at either end of the Panama Canal was unconstitutional, an outcome that advances a U.S. aim to block any influence by China over the strategic waterway.
    


            The court's ruling followed an audit by Panama's comptroller, which alleged irregularities in the 25-year extension of the concession granted in 2021.
    


            The Trump administration made blocking China's influence over the Panama Canal one of its priorities in the hemisphere. Panama was U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's first overseas stop as the United States' top diplomat.
    


            Despite the insistence by Panama's government and the canal authority that China has no influence over its operations, Rubio made clear that the U.S. viewed the operation of the ports as a national security issue for the U.S. President Donald Trump had gone so far as to say Panama should return the canal to U.S. control.
    


            The court's brief statement gave no guidance on what would happen to the ports now.
    


            Political analyst Edwin Cabrera said the next procedural step will be notifying the parties of the court's decision. Then the issue of what to do with the ports goes to Panama's executive branch, specifically the Panama Maritime Authority.
    


            “I have the impression from conversations that I have had with some people that the operation (of the ports) will not stop,” Cabrera said.
    


            CK Hutchison Holdings announced a deal last year to sell its majority stake in the Panamanian ports and others around the world to an international consortium that included BlackRock Inc. But the deal appeared to stall over objections by the Chinese government.



            In parallel, Panama's comptroller audited the concession to the Panama Ports Company, which had held the contract to operate the ports since 1997. The concession was renewed in 2021 for 25 years, during the prior Panamanian administration.
    


            Comptroller Anel Flores said the audit found payments that were not made, accounting errors and the apparent existence of a “ghost” concessions operating within the ports since 2015. The company denied those allegations.
    


            The audit determined that the irregularities had cost the government about $300 million since the concession was extended and an estimated $1.2 billion during the original 25-year contract.
    


            Flores also said the extension was granted without the required endorsement of his office.
    


            On July 30, the comptroller challenged the Panama Ports Company's contract to operate the ports before the Supreme Court.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statewide disaster declaration on Thursday to prevent the potential spread of the New World screwworm fly into the Lone Star State, as he seeks to better protect livestock and wildlife.

The governor's declaration allows the Texas New World Screwworm Response Team to use all state government prevention and response resources to prevent the spread of the parasite into Texas.

The New World screwworm fly is spreading north from Mexico toward the border it shares with the U.S.

"Although the New World screwworm fly is not yet present in Texas or the U.S., its northward spread from Mexico toward the U.S. southern border poses a serious threat to Texas' livestock industry and wildlife," Abbott said in a statement.

"State law authorizes me to act to prevent a threat of infestation that could cause severe damage to Texas property, and I will not wait for such harm to reach our livestock and wildlife," he continued.

With his statewide disaster declaration, the governor said the Texas New World Screwworm Response Team "can fully utilize all state government prevention and response resources to prevent the re-emergence of this destructive parasite."

Texas officials are prepared to fully eradicate the pest if need be, the governor said.

Abbott has taken preemptive action against the New World screwworm threat by directing the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Texas Animal Health Commission to establish a joint Texas New World Screwworm Response Team.

The governor also highlighted a partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to create a new $750 million domestic sterile New World Screwworm production facility near Edinburg, Texas.

The Department of Agriculture said in August that the New World screwworm is a "devastating pest."

"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal. NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people. It is not only a threat to our ranching community, but it is a threat to our food supply and our national security," the department said at the time.

First lady Melania Trump wants you to know that her new documentary is not a documentary.
    


            “Some have called this a documentary. It is not,” she told a crowd of Cabinet members, conservative influencers and minor celebrities gathered in the opera house of the newly rebranded Trump Kennedy Center for the film's premiere Thursday evening.
    


            “It is a creative experience that offers perspectives, insights and moments,” she said.
    


            After more than a year of production, “Melania” is getting its debut, and the country is getting an education in what has become the lucrative business of being first lady.
    


            Trump inked a $40 million deal with Amazon MGM Studios, plus a whopping $35 million marketing budget, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            Asked how she would define success for the film, the first lady didn't point to box office numbers or streaming statistics — because the deal has already been a win, in her view.
    


            “I'm very proud of the film so people may like it, may don't like it, and that's their choice,” she told CNN as she walked the red carpet, which was actually black, in keeping with her creative vision.
    


            She later added: “We achieved what we want to achieve. For myself, it's already successful. I'm very proud of what we did.”
    


What to know about the Melania Trump documentary



            The film, which documents the 20 days around Trump's return to the White House, marks an unprecedented move by a sitting first lady to profit off inside access to her private life — which is traditionally reserved for the post-presidency with less lucrative book deals and speaking engagements.
    


            “She put this deal together as a private individual and she's not an elected official, so I don't see why we would restrict her in any way,” Marc Beckman, her agent and senior adviser, said on the red carpet.
    


            Trump was still a private citizen during the presidential transition when the ink dried. But director Brett Ratner and his team were given access to the first lady well after President Donald Trump's inauguration, flying aboard Air Force One as they documented the first couple's trip to storm-ravaged North Carolina and, later, Pacific Palisades, still reeling from the California wildfires.
    


            Reporters were not invited into Thursday's screening. But the film is carefully curated, according to one source who attended, underscoring that Trump, as an executive producer on the project, had full editorial control. But there are a couple of new details from Inauguration Day preparations, the source said.
    


            Among the notable scenes is one moment where Donald Trump questioned why the college football championship game was scheduled on the same day as his inauguration – and whether that was intentional. In another scene, Trump was told he would be riding to the US Capitol in the car with his predecessor, President Joe Biden, quipping, “That'll be interesting.”
    


            The first lady speaks personally in the film about losing her mom, Amalija Knavs, who died in January 2024. She also takes the audience behind the scenes of picking out her outfits and planning the day's events, narrating it all.
    


            The president offered an early review of the not-documentary-documentary Thursday night.
    


            “I got to see it for the first time the other night. It's really good. Glamorous – very glamorous. We need some glamour,” he told reporters.
    


            He had uncharacteristically skipped two opportunities to take questions from the press earlier in the day, while running characteristically late. But but he arrived at the premiere on time and ready to chat.
    


            It was his wife's big night, but the president made news — announcing he'd be naming a Federal Reserve chair “tomorrow,” weighing in on his director of national intelligence's trip to a Georgia elections office, and saying he's been holding conversations with Iran.
    


            The space was fully decked with black-and-white branding and images of the first lady — her name emblazoned on windows and doors in the iconic Hall of States, next to a bronze bust sculpture of John F. Kennedy, and on posters and cocktail napkins.
    


            Ahead of the VIP arrivals, workers meticulously ran a Swiffer over a black carpet under a lit step-and-repeat bearing Trump's name: MELANIA, MELANIA, MELANIA.
    


            And a swarm of reporters and photographers from dozens of outlets assembled to document their arrivals: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth with his sequin-clad wife; Education Secretary Linda McMahon in a fur coat; Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins in a jacket trimmed in beaded fringe; Dr. Mehmet Oz — the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — with his family, including influencer daughter Daphne Oz; and even an appearance by the first lady's father, Viktor Knavs.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has come under criticism for her handling of the federal law enforcement shooting of Alex Pretti over the weekend in Minneapolis, skipped a dramatic entrance. But she was spotted inside the theater, according to the source in the room.
    


            Worldwide audiences will be able to see the film in theaters on Friday — an opening that will test whether there's enough curiosity about the first lady to drive people to the cinema.
    


            For House Speaker Mike Johnson — who attended Thursday's premiere as his Senate colleagues struck a deal in a bid to avert a government shutdown — the answer was yes.
    


            “I think it's worth the investment,” he said, adding, “I think it'll pay off.”

President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was present during the FBI raid in Fulton County, Georgia, to maintain election integrity even though her office doesn't directly oversee the issue.

“She's working very hard on trying to keep the election safe, and she's done a very good job,” he said of Gabbard. “They got into the votes with a signed judge's order in Georgia, and you're going to see some interesting things happening. They've been trying to get there for a long time.”

The FBI executed a search warrant on Wednesday at an election facility in Fulton County, which was at the center of alleged voter fraud and election litigation following the 2020 presidential election. Ever since his election loss that year, Trump has consistently spoken out against election fraud.

Gabbard was photographed in Fulton County on the day of the raid as the FBI seized 2020 election ballots. Her appearance largely went unexplained, prompting outrage from Democrats.

Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) is especially concerned about what the retroactive federal review of election results means for the future.

“This is a seismic event. This should have people across the country absolutely shook. This is a huge deal,” Ossoff said. “And here's the thing: This is a shot across the bow at the midterm elections. [Trump] tried to steal power when he lost it in 2020. We have to be prepared for all kinds of schemes and shenanigans. We have to be prepared for him to try to deprive people of their voting rights.”

Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was also not fond of Gabbard's surprise appearance in Georgia.

“Either Director Gabbard believes there was a legitimate foreign intelligence nexus — in which case she is in clear violation of her obligation under the law to keep the intelligence committees ‘fully and currently informed' of relevant national security concerns — or she is once again demonstrating her utter lack of fitness for the office that she holds by injecting the nonpartisan intelligence community she is supposed to be leading into a domestic political stunt designed to legitimize conspiracy theories that undermine our democracy,” Warner said on X.

“Either is a serious breach of trust that further underscores why she is totally unqualified to hold a position that demands sound judgment, apolitical independence, and a singular focus on keeping Americans safe,” he added.

Gabbard has not explained her involvement in the case. An administration official has said she plays a “pivotal role in election security and protecting the integrity of our elections against interference, including operations targeting voting systems, databases, and election infrastructure.”

Trump answered various questions at the Kennedy Center premiere of first lady Melania Trump's eponymous documentary, scheduled for a Friday theatrical release.

When asked about his administration's immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, the president replied he would not be pulling back.

“We want to keep our country safe. We'll do whatever we can to keep our country safe,” he said.

His administration is facing increasing scrutiny after immigration officers killed two American citizens in Minneapolis this month. Despite the public outcry, federal personnel will not be leaving.

JON OSSOFF CALLS FOR MORE ATTENTION TOWARD ‘SEISMIC' FULTON COUNTY RAID

The president also revealed he will announce his choice to become the next Federal Reserve chairman on Friday morning, confirming he knows who he's going to pick.

Former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, Fed governor Christopher Waller, and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett are among the top contenders for the position. The nominee, whoever it is, will replace Jerome Powell once his term as chairman ends in May.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to declare a national emergency over the Cuban regime's support for “malign actors adverse to the United States.”

The executive order says those actors include Russia, China, Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah.

“Cuba blatantly hosts dangerous adversaries of the United States, inviting them to base sophisticated military and intelligence capabilities in Cuba that directly threaten the national security of the United States,” the directive reads, citing Russia as a frequent guest of Cuba.

WHAT ARE TRUMP ACCOUNTS? GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES $1000 BABY BONUS

By declaring a national emergency, Trump intends to create a “tariff system” targeting Cuban imports, including oil.

The move comes one day after Mexico temporarily halted its oil shipments to Cuba. The Caribbean island once relied heavily on oil shipments from Venezuela, but that supply was cut off when the United States asserted control over the South American nation this month.

The proposed tariff system will feature an “additional ad valorem duty” on imports that are either directly or indirectly sold to Cuba by foreign countries. The order says the system is a “necessary and appropriate” part of the declared national emergency.

The additional tariff took effect immediately upon Trump's signature of the order.

The president directed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to determine whether any foreign adversaries directly or indirectly sell goods or oil to Cuba. Lutnick will then consult with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other administration officials about his findings.

HERE'S WHERE HOUSE AND SENATE RETIREMENTS STAND IN 2026

This action indicates the Trump administration is looking forward to possible regime change in Cuba. Rubio confirmed that desire during his Senate testimony on Wednesday, but he said the U.S. may not be directly involved in setting up a new government for Cuba.

“Regime change? Oh no, I think we would love to see the regime there change,” Rubio answered when asked if the administration would rule out regime change. “That doesn't mean we are going to make a change, but we would love to see a change. There's no doubt about the fact that it would be of great benefit to the United States if Cuba was no longer governed by an autocratic regime.”

As a Cuban American citizen born in Miami, Rubio has been especially critical of Cuba's poor economic conditions and communist leadership.

“That's a country that's been backwards,” he said during the hearing. “It has no functional economy. The people, you can call them Marxists, we can call them communists, but not even Lenin would recognize this version of communism and Marxism that they've instilled in Cuba.”

RUBIO SAYS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WOULD ‘LOVE' TO SEE REGIME CHANGE IN CUBA

After signing the executive order, Trump commented on possible regime change in Cuba.

“The word choke off is awfully tough,” Trump said when asked if he's trying to “choke off” the island. “Cuba is a failing nation, and you have to feel badly for Cuba. They've treated people very badly. We have a lot of Cuban Americans who really were treated very badly, and they probably like to go back. No, I'm not trying to, but it looks like it's something that's just not going to be able to survive. I think Cuba will not be able to survive.”

President Donald Trump has a Jerome Powell-sized problem with installing Kevin Warsh as the new Fed chair.

A key Republican senator has vowed to oppose the confirmation of any nominee to be the next Federal Reserve chairman until the Department of Justice's probe into Powell, the current chair, is resolved.

That senator — Thom Tillis of North Carolina — happens to sit on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, which considers Fed chair nominations. If all Democrats join Tillis in opposing Warsh's confirmation, Warsh's nomination will effectively be stuck in committee.

In a post on X on Friday, Tillis made clear that he has nothing against Warsh, who has otherwise been lauded as a strong pick by both Republicans and economists.

"Kevin Warsh is a qualified nominee with a deep understanding of monetary policy," Tillis wrote, later adding: "Protecting the independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference or legal intimidation is non-negotiable."

Earlier this month, Powell revealed that the DOJ issued grand jury subpoenas to the Federal Reserve related to recent renovations at the building.

Powell called the probe an effort to exert pressure on the central bank's monetary policy, and central bankers from around the world have rallied to Powell's defense.

Trump has said that he had no knowledge of the subpoenas before Powell made them public.

In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that Warsh is "eminently qualified to serve" as the next Fed chair and that the White House "looks forward to working with the Senate to quickly confirm him and get the Federal Reserve back on track."

Trump appeared unmoved by Tillis's opposition, telling reporters in the Oval Office later on Friday that it's "too bad."

He also suggested that Warsh's confirmation may have to wait until Tillis is out of office. The North Carolina senator's term ends in January 2027.

"If he doesn't approve, we'll just have to wait until somebody comes in that will approve it," Trump said.

Under Senate rules, before the full chamber can vote on a nominee, it must be reported "favorably" by the committee with jurisdiction, which requires a majority vote.

Democrats are expected to broadly oppose Warsh's confirmation, with many raising concerns about the independence of the Fed.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement on Friday that "no Republican purporting to care about Fed independence should agree to move forward with this nomination" under the circumstances.

If Tillis and every Democrat vote against Warsh's nomination, that leads to a deadlocked 12-12 committee vote.

It would take 60 votes in the Senate to bypass that committee vote and bring his nomination to the floor — an unlikely prospect, given that it requires Democratic support.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune has acknowledged the predicament. According to POLITICO, when asked on Thursday whether Warsh could be confirmed without Tillis's support, Thune said: "Uh, probably not."

Earlier this year, Tillis opted not to seek reelection, making it far more difficult for Trump to exert pressure on him to change his mind.

Eli Lilly on Friday said it will spend more than $3.5 billion to build a manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley that will help make its next-generation obesity drugs.

That includes a closely watched experimental drug called retatrutide, which has shown the highest weight loss seen to date for any treatment in a late-stage trial. 

It is the fourth facility in a string of new planned U.S. investments by the pharmaceutical giant. Lilly announced in February 2025 that it would spend at least $27 billion to build new domestic manufacturing facilities, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020. 

On Thursday, President Donald Trump said Lilly CEO Dave Ricks has told him the drugmaker aims to build six plants in the U.S. But Lilly has not confirmed those plans. 

The company on Friday said it expects construction of the Pennsylvania plant to start this year and for the site to be operational in 2031. 

That added production capacity for upcoming weight loss treatments is crucial. Retatrutide is viewed as a key pillar of Lilly's long-term obesity strategy after its popular injection Zepbound and upcoming obesity pill. 

Some health experts say retatrutide, which works by targeting three gut hormones rather than one or two, can reach patients with severe obesity who would benefit from even more weight loss than what existing injections can offer. Lilly plans to release data from seven other Phase 3 trials on the drug this year. 

The company and its chief rival, Novo Nordisk, have invested heavily in boosting production capacity after previously facing supply shortages for their existing weekly injections in the U.S. 

Preparing enough supply of upcoming drugs is also central to Lilly's efforts to maintain its dominance in the booming GLP-1 market. The company secured the majority share in the space last year for the first time, overtaking Novo. 

But the Danish drugmaker is hoping to close the gap with the launch of the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity this month, which has already racked up thousands of U.S. prescriptions. Lilly has its own pill, orforglipron, that could win approval and launch later this year. 

Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. after threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. But concerns about those potential tariffs have eased following voluntary drug pricing deals with Trump in recent months that exempt companies — including both Lilly and Novo — from the levies for three years. 

Eli Lilly said the Pennsylvania site will bring 850 jobs to the area, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, as well as 2,000 construction jobs.

Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said Friday that Venezuela has taken positive steps to protect investment by private oil companies since the Trump administration captured former President Nicolás Maduro.

Venezuela on Thursday passed reforms to its hydrocarbon law that ease state control of the oil industry and grants private producers more autonomy. 

Wirth said Chevron is still reviewing the legislation. The CEO said security of contracts, commercial stability and regulatory predictability are key to attract investment in Venezuela. 

"We see Venezuela taking steps in a positive direction to address those issues, which will encourage investment, not only from a company like ours, but from others that I think are also considering the opportunities there," Wirth told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" in an interview. 

Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela through a special license issued by the Treasury Department. It is currently producing about 250,000 barrels per day through joint ventures with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA. 

Wirth said Friday that Chevron could increase production in Venezuela by up to 50% over the next 18 to 24 months if the company receives authorization from the U.S. government.

Wall Street largely views Chevron as the U.S. oil company best positioned to benefit from the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela due to its presence in the country and its relationship with PDVSA. 

"We've stayed when others didn't," Wirth said. "We're getting paid back some debts that we're owed, and it does give us a significant head start. And the country has tremendous long-term potential."

The CEO said the security situation is mostly stable where Chevron operates though there are areas of Venezuela that are less safe. 

"We've got good, strong safety protocols and security protocols in place in the country,"  Wirth said. "And our operations have continued uninterrupted through this entire period of time."

Chevron reported fourth-quarter earnings on Friday that beat estimates. The oil major increased production in 2025 by 12% worldwide and 16% in the U.S. to record levels.

While Chevron is ready to ramp up production, competitor Exxon Mobil is wary of returning to Venezuela after its assets were seized twice in the past. Exxon CEO Darren Woods has called the country uninvestable. He told CNBC on Friday that the country needs to transition to democracy for investment to make sense.

President Donald Trump is pressuring the oil industry to invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. 

Chevron shares were trading up 1.4% after reporting its results. The stock has gain nearly 14% since the start of the year, outpacing the broader market.

Luigi Mangione will not face a possible death penalty sentence in the New York federal criminal case where he is charged with killing health insurance CEO Brian Thompson, a judge ruled Friday.

Manhattan U.S. District Court Judge Margaret Garnett, in an order Friday, dismissed two of the four criminal counts Mangione faced in the case. 

The potential maximum sentence for the remaining two counts for causing the UnitedHealthcare executive's death under federal stalking laws is "life in prison without parole," Garnett noted. Thompson was fatally shot on a midtown Manhattan street in December 2024.

The third count accused Mangione of the murder of Thompson through the use of a firearm during that alleged stalking. That count, which the judge tossed out, would have made Mangione eligible for a possible death sentence. The fourth count, which was also dismissed, accused Mangione of the use of a firearm equipped with a silencer during the stalking.

"The crimes charged in Counts Three and Four require that the stalking crimes in Count One and Two meet the federal statutory definition of 'crimes of violence' as a matter of law," Garnett wrote. "The Defendant has moved to dismiss Counts Three and Four on that ground that this requirement is not satisfied."

The judge, who admitted that the analysis she applied to that argument "may strike the average person — and indeed many lawyers and judges — as tortured and strange," ruled that Supreme Court precedent bound her to conclude that the first two counts did not meet the definition of "crimes of violence."

"The motion is GRANTED."

Separately on Friday, Garnett dismissed a motion by Mangione's defense team to suppress the contents of the backpack in his possession when he was questioned and detained by police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days after Thompson's killing.

A police search of that backpack initially found a loaded gun magazine, and then later a handgun, a silencer, and a red notebook, among other items. Mangione's attorneys had argued that the search was not legally valid.

Mangione also faces murder charges in state court in Manhattan, where prosecutors are seeking to try him before the federal trial.

Sandisk's stock popped 14% after the company crushed Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter estimates, as the artificial intelligence boom sent demand for its chips skyrocketing. 

The flash storage memory company reported earnings of $6.20 per share, excluding items, blowing past the $3.62 per share expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet. Revenue totaled $3.03 billion, topping a forecast of $2.69 billion. 

Shares had jumped more than 20% in the premarket. 

Sandisk's third-quarter forecast also outpaced expectations for analysts. 

Sandisk guided for between $4.4 billion and $4.8 billion in revenue for the quarter. That blew away the $2.93 billion expected by FactSet. The company expects adjusted earnings between $12 and $14 per share in the third quarter, more than double the $5.11 estimate from analysts. 

Raymond James analysts upgraded the stock to an outperform rating, citing Sandisk's pricing momentum as new supply struggles to come online. 

"We know demand is exceptionally strong and likely only growing, supply is tightening to the point of potentially being sold out for years," the firm wrote, believing the company should benefit from "longer-lived" datacenter production. 

Memory companies like Sandisk are seeing a boost from skyrocketing memory need, as businesses race to funnel more storage supply into the power-hungry datacenter buildout that's fueling the AI revolution.

The company's datacenter business grew 64%, sequentially.

This backdrop has also created a supply and demand imbalance that's allowed memory companies to hike prices and maintain strong margins. 

Sandisk said it expects third-quarter gross margins to range between 65% and 67%, far ahead of the 49.3% expected by analysts polled by StreetAccount.

The memory shortage has hit multiple areas of the tech sector, and Apple reported supply issues of its own when it reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday.

CEO Tim Cook said access to advanced node manufacturing was keeping it from making more iPhones, but the company would be hit by rising memory prices.

Cook said Apple was looking at "a range of options to deal with that."

Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods said Friday that Venezuela needs to transition to democracy in order for investment in the South American nation's dilapidated oil industry to make sense. 

President Donald Trump is pressuring oil companies to invest at least $100 billion in Venezuela to rebuild the country's oil industry after the U.S. captured former President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. 

But Woods told Trump at the White House on Jan. 9 that Venezuela is "uninvestable" in its current state. The Exxon CEO's blunt assessment angered the president who threatened to cut the oil major out of any future investment in the country.

Woods stood by his assessment in an interview with CNBC on Friday. He said the government in Caracas needs to make major reforms for Exxon to seriously consider returning to Venezuela. 

"Those priorities start with one, stabilizing the country," Woods told CNBC's "Squawk Box." "Second is to kick-start the economy and try to recover some of the damage that's been done over the decades of abuse that the dictators brought in, and then ultimately to transition into representative government." 

The Trump administration has not laid out a clear plan for Venezuela to hold elections and transition to a democratic government. Senior administration officials have said they are focused right now on stabilizing the country and improving its economy through oil sales. 

The U.S. has been working with Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, who is a long-standing insider in the authoritarian regime that former President Hugo Chavez built. The cooperation with Rodriguez has raised concern among some observers that the current regime could remain in place so long as it meets the Trump administration's demands on oil. 

Exxon exited Venezuela in 2007 after its assets were seized by the Chavez regime. It has billions of dollars in outstanding claims against Caracas from the nationalization. 

"Frankly, from our perspective, there's a principle that we stand on that if you don't uphold the sanctity of the contracts, if you choose to instead to steal the investments that we made and undermine the work that we've been doing, that we can't continue to work with you," Woods said. 

Trump told oil industry CEOs at the White House meeting that his administration is not planning to force Venezuela to play claims from the 2007 nationalization. 

"We're not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault," Trump said on Jan. 9. "That was a different president. You're going to make a lot of money, but we're not going to go back."

Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, is believed to have the largest crude oil reserves in the world but its energy infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. 

Investment to repair Venezuela's infrastructure could prove financially challenging right now as a surplus of crude oil in the world has depressed prices. Oil prices in 2025 posted their steepest annual loss since 2020 as OPEC+ increased production and the U.S. continued to pump oil at a strong clip.

Earlier Friday, Exxon reported fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates, but both profit and revenue were down from the year-ago period due to weak crude prices. Notably, Exxon achieved its highest full-year net production in more than 40 years at 4.7 million barrels per day. It pumped 4.98 million bpd in the quarter with its assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana setting output records for the period.

Exxon's competitor, Chevron, is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela under a special license issued by the Treasury Department. Chevron says it can increase production in Venezuela by 50% over the next 18 to 24 months. 

While Exxon's stock was down more than 1% after reporting its results, its shares have had a strong start to the year. The stock has gained nearly 16% in 2026, outpacing the S&P 500's 1.6% bump.

For many Americans, the best part of the Super Bowl is the commercials. This year, you can make — or lose — money on them, too.

Prediction market platforms Kalshi and Polymarket currently have contracts open on which companies will run ads during Super Bowl 60, which will feature the Seattle Seahawks vs. the New England Patriots and is set for Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California. Users can trade on whether Salesforce or Verizon or Coca-Cola will have a Super Bowl spot this year, for example.

While Polymarket's trades are just a "Yes/No" bet, Kalshi has a few predictions that are a bit more nuanced, such as, "Who will appear in a big game ad before Feb 9, 2026?", with trades available for Sydney Sweeney, Timothée Chalamet and Harry Styles. 

It's a new wrinkle for the advertising industry's biggest night. The price of Super Bowl commercials goes higher and higher each year as the Super Bowl's TV audience keeps rising. Last year's game was watched by 127.7 million viewers, a record high. That game, broadcast by Fox, generated about $7.5 million per 30-second spot, with 10 or so ads commanding more than $8 million. 

This year, NBC, which will broadcast the game, has sold out all of its ad inventory, averaging $8 million per 30-second commercial, with between five and 10 ads selling for more than $10 million apiece, according to Mark Marshall, NBC's chairman of global advertising and partnerships. The closer to the game that a company buys an ad slot, the more it pays. 

According to Marshall, technology companies have bought the most spots across this year's slate, though NBC defines technology relatively broadly: Uber Eats, for example, is considered a tech company. Only two automobile companies are advertising during the game. About 40% of advertisers this year have never bought a Super Bowl spot before, Marshall said.

But the entrance of prediction market platforms means Marshall has reason to keep details close to the vest. 

For those not familiar with how these prediction markets work, they basically trade like stocks, with contracts priced between $0 and $1. The contracts trade up or down depending on the action. 

For example, for "Which brands will advertise during the big game 2026?" on Kalshi, Spotify spiked on Jan. 19, going from $0.35 to $0.69 before settling down. As of Friday morning, a "Yes" contract for Spotify was priced at $0.37.

If your predicted outcome materializes, you get paid, with winning contracts paying out $1 each, minus fees. 

Both Polymarket and Kalshi are also offering other prediction trades around the Super Bowl, including "What songs will be played at the halftime show?," "Who will attend the big game?" (Lionel Messi? Elon Musk?), and more traditional sportsbook "bets" such as "Seattle vs. New England: Most Rushing Yards."

While straight sports predictions, such as rushing yards, are unknown events, there are likely hundreds, if not thousands, of employees who know whether their company is planning to run a Super Bowl commercial. That makes some contracts ripe for insider trading.

Existing laws prohibit insider trading on prediction markets, but industry experts are skeptical that a gutted Commodity Futures Trading Commission has the will or the staff to police those problems. 

Meanwhile the question of whether events contracts on sports amount to financial derivatives or gambling is dividing the sports gambling industry — and tying federal courts in knots.  

"A couple of courts have held that event contracts based on sports are not derivatives subject to the CFTC's authority," said Jack Murphy, senior counsel at Akin Gump and a former CFTC enforcement attorney. "Those decisions are up on appeal. If sports event contracts aren't derivatives, then criminal authorities could still prosecute insider trading on prediction markets under a wire fraud theory."

On Thursday, Michael Selig, the new chairman of the CFTC, said he had directed agency staff to withdraw a proposed rule that would ban prediction trades on sports and politics. He said new rules would be coming. 

Meanwhile live sports continue to fuel prediction market growth. Kalshi's on track for 44% month-over-month growth in total trading volume, according to Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley. The contract on "Who will win the Super Bowl?" has already accounted for more than $150 million in trading volume.

Former CNN anchor Don Lemon was arrested by federal agents in connection with his journalistic activities covering protests in Minnesota, his lawyer said Friday.

Lemon "was taken into custody by federal agents last night in Los Angeles, where he was covering the Grammy awards," his attorney, Abbe Lowell, in a statement. 

"Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done," Lowell said.

Department of Justice officials had publicly vowed to bring charges against Lemon over his presence at a Jan. 18 protest at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota. 

Lemon, an independent reporter who hosts "The Don Lemon Show" on YouTube, has said he was reporting on the protest. A federal magistrate judge last week reportedly rejected a criminal complaint that was brought against Lemon.

In Friday's statement, Lowell called Lemon's arrest an "unprecedented attack on the First Amendment" and a "transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration."

"Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court," Lowell said.

Today's the day not to do much of anything.

At least, that's what a group of ICE protesters is hoping for.

Activist groups, unions, and some celebrities, including Hannah Einbinder and Pedro Pascal, are promoting a nationwide blackout. No work. No school. No shopping. It's in response to the recent fatal shootings by immigration officers in Minnesota.

Of course, getting buzz on social media about a protest is one thing. Executing it is something else entirely. Minnesotans did take to the streets for a regional protest on January 23, but this is on a much larger scale.

It's unclear what, if any, impact Friday's protest will have on the economy. For context, boycotters last year planned an economic blackout of major retailers on February 28 to protest corporate corruption.

The impact wasn't massive — only a 5.4% drop in sales, according to Numerator — but Black and LGBTQ+ shoppers did noticeably shift their spending habits that day.

But these one-off events are more so meant to signal frustration than destroy companies' bottom lines. And some change has already been elicited, as Maine Sen. Susan Collins announced ICE halted "enhanced activities" in the state.

One company that's right in the thick of it has issues beyond a one-day blackout.

Minneapolis-based Target has deep ties to the city and a history of navigating civil unrest there. Now it has the added challenge of doing it with a new CEO.

Michael Fiddelke is facing a baptism by fire as he takes over as Target's new CEO this weekend, writes BI's Dominick Reuter and Sarah Needleman.

Hundreds of Target employees already signed a letter urging the company to bar ICE from its stores. Fiddelke addressed the situation in a video message Monday, but didn't name Trump or ICE specifically.

Fiddelke's problems don't just stem from the rising tension in the city over the past few weeks. In recent years, Tar-jay has started feeling pretty blasé. Over the past 12 quarters, 10 have had flat or declining comparable sales.

But Target didn't bring in outside talent to shake things up. Fiddelke is a true company man, starting at Target as a finance intern. And former longtime CEO Brian Cornell is sticking around as executive chairman.

Fiddelke's deep knowledge of the company could be considered a strength. But with so much ground to make up, drastic changes outside what's been the norm might be the company's best way forward.

President Donald Trump has chosen Kevin Warsh, a former bank executive and central bank governor, to lead the Federal Reserve.

Within minutes of the nomination, reactions started pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders.

Here are what some of the leading voices in economics and business are saying.

The renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian congratulated Warsh on his nomination to lead the Fed.

"Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of the Group of Thirty (G-30), I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills," El-Erian wrote in a post on X.

"His commitment to reforming and modernizing the Fed bodes well for enhancing policy effectiveness and protecting the institution's political independence."

Earlier in January, El-Erian wrote on X that the Department of Justice probe into Jerome Powell could undermine the "credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile."

Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economist to President Barack Obama, wrote on X that "Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve."

"The Senate should ask tough questions about his independence & President Trump should reduce the threat to it. Hopefully that will make it clear Warsh should be confirmed," he wrote.

"Warsh has a range of views that would not have led me to recommend a Democratic President nominate him as Federal Reserve Chair," Furman added. "I would be thrilled if he ends up conducting himself over the next four years in a way that would make a President of any party want to reappoint him."

Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence and reform, as well as on reducing the Fed's balance sheet.

"Moreover, he should be challenged to how he would respond in a financial crisis given his public track record of focusing on inflation risk during a time of rising unemployment and deflation during the early portion of the Great Financial crisis," Brusuelas wrote on X.

"Warsh has a range of views and track record that presents significant concerns about how he would proceed during a financial and economic crisis. I would not have recommended him but he is qualified for the job," he added.

Robin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings, said in an X post that Warsh "is a really good pick for Fed Chair and known as a hawk."

He did, however, note the muted market reaction in the minutes after the announcement.

"But markets are asking themselves what was promised to get the nod, which is why the Dollar - after its huge decline in recent days - isn't managing to rally on what should be good news," said Brooks, who was also a managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.

Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and research professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, criticized Warsh's nomination.

He wrote in a post on his Substack: "As I write this, many media reports are describing Warsh as a monetary hawk. That's a category error. Warsh is a political animal. He calls for tight money and opposes any attempt to boost the economy when Democrats hold the White House."

Krugman cited Warsh's track record as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, saying he had "argued strenuously against the Fed's efforts to boost the economy."

"It's a humiliating day for the Federal Reserve, which has always prided itself on its professionalism and has been hugely respected around the world. But even the Fed can't insulate itself from the derangement sweeping America," he added.

Sonali Basak, the chief investment strategist for iCapital and a former Bloomberg anchor, wrote on X: "Between Bessent & Warsh, you have two proteges of Stanley Druckenmiller in the most powerful finance posts in government."

Warsh is a partner at billionaire Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office LLC.

George Osborne, the UK's former Chancellor of the Exchequer,  praised Trump's decision to nominate Warsh as Fed chair.

"Kevin Warsh is an excellent choice as Chair of the Fed - smart, serious, experienced, knows the new economy as well as the old," said Osborne, who leads OpenAI for Countries, wrote in a post on X.

"I've been fortunate enough to know him for more than twenty years and this is the job he was put on earth to do. The world feels a little safer - and more prosperous - today," he added.

Howard, the billionaire founder of $33 billion macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, called Warsh an "outstanding choice for Fed Chair."

"I've known him for more than 20 years, and his judgment, integrity, and depth of experience will make him an exceptional leader of the Federal Reserve," Howard said in a statement sent to Business Insider.

In his first stint at the Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh came to a central bank that was about to be asked to save the world. He returns now under very different circumstances, asked to serve a notoriously fickle president who will place significant but very different demands on him.

Warsh indeed is a Fed veteran, serving during the critical period of 2006 to 2011 that led up to and ultimately through the global financial crisis and the central bank's efforts to stabilize the economy. Appointed by President George W. Bush, Warsh was one of the youngest members ever to serve on the board of governors.

While at the Fed, Warsh played an important role in the design and implementation of emergency lending programs aimed at stabilizing credit markets. Warsh also played a key role in helping devise the myriad programs aimed at rescuing the economy. One of those programs, developed separately at the Treasury Department, became known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, developed by Neel Kashkari, who is now the Minneapolis Fed president.

However, Warsh emerged from the era as a Fed critic. 

He warned that large-scale asset purchases and near-zero benchmark interest rates ran the risk of distorting markets and undermining long-term price stability. While supporting the earlier efforts, Warsh voted against the second round of Fed bond buying, a program known as quantitative easing.

Warsh has further criticized the post-financial crisis Fed with going too far in monetary policy stimulus, contending that it is helping sow the sees for further crises. In some respects, President Donald Trump is appointing a Fed chair who may be even less inclined to accommodate political pressure than Jerome Powell.

Trump cited Warsh's extensive background in announcing his appointment to the top Fed post Friday morning. Warsh is currently a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford University.

"On top of everything else, he is 'central casting,' and he will never let you down," the president posted on Truth Social.

Warsh, is a Stanford University graduate who earned his law degree from Harvard and ultimately married into the Lauder cosmetics family. Before joining the Fed, he worked in investment banking at Morgan Stanley and served in the George W. Bush White House as a special assistant to the president for economic policy.

While positioning himself as a defender of Fed independence, Warsh also has criticized it for mission creep and told CNBC in an interview last year that the central bank needs "regime change."

Warsh made his misgivings known about the current Fed. 

"The credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the Fed, in my view," he said during that July interview. It's a position that could put him in an adversarial role at an institution where consensus building is key to policy implementation.

Despite multiple missteps on policymaking, Chair Powell has largely been able to keep the Fed consensus together. However, in recent months that has faltered, with each of the past several meetings featuring at least one and sometimes multiple dissents. 

Warsh's appointment would mark a sharp philosophical shift from Powell's pragmatic, consensus-driven approach and signal a potential tightening of the Fed's tolerance for inflation and balance sheet expansion. He would fill the seat currently occupied by Stephen Miran, whose term expires Saturday.

Miran told CNBC on Friday that he supports the pick.

"Chairman-designate Warsh has a long history of being an innovative and original thinker on monetary policy," Miran said. "He's got a number of really important insights over the years, and I'm really excited to see all the good work he's going to do at the Fed."

But if Trump thinks Warsh will be able to just push through aggressive rate cuts with ease, he might be in for an unpleasant surprise. Multiple voting members on the Federal Open Market Committee have expressed resistance to cutting further until there's more evidence that inflation is definitively moving towards the central bank's 2% inflation goal. 

Moreover, the full group of Fed officials in December indicated they see just one more rate cut coming in 2026, then another in 2027. In the aggregate, that's in line with market expectations, with futures traders pricing in two reductions this year and none next year.

Traditionally, though, the chair has been first among equals when it comes to voting on the FOMC, so Warsh may be able to tilt the group in at least a bit more dovish direction.

"We see Warsh as a pragmatist not an ideological hawk in the tradition of the independent conservative central banker," Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note. "Because he has a hawkish reputation and is seen as independent, he is better placed to bring the FOMC along with him to deliver at least two and plausibly three cuts this year than some rivals."

So while Warsh may prove an ideological ally of the administration, how that translates into action will be a key question.

"Analytically, we expect he will be strongly aligned with the Administration's arguments that booming productivity will allow for neutral or accommodative rates even with robust growth," wrote Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research. "But it all depends how the data comes in, as we expect the rest of the FOMC will remain data-dependent and focused on the workhorse Fed models that Warsh has criticized."

Warsh emerged from a competitive derby that one included 11 candidates, an array of past and present Fed officials, leading economists and a few Wall Street investment professionals including BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder. That field was whittled down to five then four before Warsh emerged as the selection.

Trump made no secret of the most important criteria — a willingness to slash rates lower and keep them low. The president has expressed the importance of lower rates as both a way to help the moribund U.S. housing market and to help lower financing costs for the $37 trillion U.S. debt. 

Before all that, he will have to be confirmed by a Senate during a ticklish political situation. 

The Trump Justice Department has been investigating the massive renovation project at the Fed's Washington, D.C., headquarters and has served Powell with a subpoena demanding information. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has vowed to block any Trump Fed nominees until that situation is resolved.

Once that hurdle is cleared, Warsh would face a full Senate in which Republicans still command a majority.

"The Warsh pick is likely to have broad support – Democrat economist Jason Furman is out early in favor – and he should be relatively easy to confirm in the Senate," Guha said.

Don Lemon, the former CNN anchor, was arrested in Los Angeles on Thursday night.

Lemon's arrest comes after protesters interrupted a service at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota.

He has said that he was reporting as a journalist when he entered the Cities Church on January 18. Protesters said that one of the church's pastors also worked for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In a statement, Lemon's attorney Abbe Lowell said he was taken into custody by federal agents in Los Angeles, where he was covering the Grammy awards.

"Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done," Lowell said.

Lowell called the criminal charges an "unprecedented attack on the First Amendment."

"Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court," he said.

Attorney General Pamela Bondi confirmed Lemon's arrest in a post on X.

She also said that Georgia Fort, another independent journalist, had been taken into custody, along with two other people.

"At my direction, early this morning federal agents arrested Don Lemon, Trahern Jeen Crews, Georgia Fort, and Jamael Lydell Lundy, in connection with the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota," Bondi wrote.

Fort posted a livestream on Facebook on Friday morning where she said federal agents were at her door.

"They said they were able to go to a grand jury sometime, I guess, in the last 24 hours, and they have a warrant for my arrest," Fort said in the video. "I've talked to my attorney and I've been advised to go with them."

"It's hard to understand how we gave constitutional rights when you can be arrested for just being a member of the press," she said at the end of the video. "Alright, I gotta go, they're knocking."

The Trump administration sought to charge eight people in relation to the Cities Church incident, citing a law protecting people in a service at a house of worship. Minnesota has been rocked by major protests amid a surge of ICE agents that the Trump administration has sent to the state to ramp up deportations.

A federal magistrate judge had previously rejected charges against five people who appeared at the protest, including Lemon, according to The New York Times.

Lemon left CNN in 2023 after 17 years at the network. He has since worked as an independent content creator, distributing his work on social media and hosting live events.

The day after the Cities Church protest, President Donald Trump shared a screenshot of an X post on his Truth Social calling for Lemon to be imprisoned.

In a statement Friday, Seth Stern, an executive at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said the arrests of Lemon and Fort were "naked attacks on freedom of the press."

"These arrests, under bogus legal theories for obviously constitutionally protected reporting, are clear warning shots aimed at other journalists," Seth said. "The unmistakable message is that journalists must tread cautiously because the government is looking for any way to target them."

Sen. Thom Tillis said Friday that he will oppose President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve chair until the criminal probe of the current chair, Jerome Powell, is "fully" resolved.

"Protecting the independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference or legal intimidation is non-negotiable," the North Carolina Republican said in a statement on X.

Tillis, who is set to retire, vowed earlier this month to oppose any new nominee for the Fed until the Department of Justice's controversial investigation of Powell is completed. 

Tillis is a member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, which has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats. 

The refusal of a single Republican on that panel to vote for a presidential nominee would set up a stalemate that could leave Warsh's nomination without a recommendation of approval by the full Senate.

Powell has said he is under investigation by the DOJ, ostensibly in connection with the Fed's multibillion-dollar renovation of its headquarters and his testimony to Congress about that project.

Powell says the real reason for the probe is his and other Fed board members' refusal to cut interest rates as quickly and as much as Trump has demanded.

"Kevin Warsh is a qualified nominee with a deep understanding of monetary policy," Tillis said in his statement. 

"However, the Department of Justice continues to pursue a criminal investigation into Chairman Jerome Powell based on committee testimony that no reasonable person could construe as possessing criminal intent," Tillis said.

"My position has not changed: I will oppose the confirmation of any Federal Reserve nominee, including for the position of Chairman, until the DOJ's inquiry into Chairman Powell is fully and transparently resolved."

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the banking committee, in a statement on Friday, said, "No Republican purporting to care about Fed independence should agree to move forward with this nomination" of Warsh.

"Donald Trump said anybody who disagrees with him will never be Fed Chairman," Warren said.

"Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh – who cared more about helping Wall Street after the 2008 crash than millions of unemployed Americans – has apparently passed the loyalty test," she said.

"This nomination is the latest step in Trump's attempt to seize control of the Fed and follows the Trump Administration's weaponization of the Department of Justice to open criminal investigations into Fed Governor Lisa Cook and sitting Fed Chair Jerome Powell."

President Donald Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair, ending a prolonged odyssey that has seen unprecedented turmoil around the central bank.

The decision culminates a process that officially began last summer but started much earlier than that, with Trump launching a fusillade of criticism against the Powell-led Fed almost since Powell took the job in 2018. 

"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best," Trump said in a Truth Social post announcing the selection.

The pick of Warsh, 55, likely won't ripple markets because of his past Fed experience and Wall Street's view that he wouldn't always do Trump's bidding.

"He has the respect and credibility of the financial markets," said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

"There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn't going to be cutting rates in the short term. However, I believe longer term he will be a credible candidate," added Bahnsen.

Stock market futures nevertheless were slightly negative Friday morning, though off their lows since Warsh's appointment became clear.

Warsh now faces Senate confirmation. If approved, he will take over the position in May, when Powell's term expires. Warsh will fill the Board of Governors position currently held by Governor Stephen Miran, whose term expires Saturday. Miran can continue to serve until a replacement is named. 

Since Powell's confirmation in 2018, during Trump's first term, the president has persistently hectored policymakers to lower interest rates aggressively. Even with three successive reductions in the latter part of 2025, Trump kept up the attack, pressing for lower rates and criticizing Powell for cost overruns at the Fed's massive renovation of its Washington, D.C., headquarters.

Beyond interest rates, Warsh comes to the Fed at a time when policymakers have taken a looser hand on banking regulations. Among the changes, pushed by Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, herself once in the running for Fed chair, are lower capital requirements, reducing supervision and supervisory staff, and backing the Fed out of ancillary efforts like pushing banks to prepare for climate events.

For his part, Warsh in a CNBC interview last summer called for "regime change" at the Fed.

"The credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the Fed, in my view," he said during the July interview. It's a position that could put him in an adversarial role at an institution where consensus building is key to policy implementation.

Trump's decision to nominate Warsh comes at one of the most precarious moments for the U.S. central bank in decades — with inflation not fully defeated, government borrowing escalating and the Fed itself facing unusually direct political pressure over how it conducts monetary policy.

Most recently, the Justice Department subpoenaed Powell regarding the construction project. In an uncharacteristically blunt response, Powell charged the move was a "pretext" to push the Fed into following Trump's orders and ease policy further.

To that end, the nomination comes as questions about Fed independence, a bedrock of central bank credibility, have moved from academic debate into concern. Trump and other administration officials have  floated ideas ranging from tighter White House oversight to changes in how the central bank sets rates, including forcing the chair to consult with the president on rate decisions.

"I want to keep it nice and pure, but he certainly wants to cut rates," Trump said Friday afternoon during an Oval Office session with reporters. He added that he has not talked with Warsh about cutting rates, though the president said that would be a litmus test for candidates.

The nomination ends a competitive derby that at one point included 11 candidates. They spanned from former and current Fed officials to prominent economists and Wall Street pros in an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Ultimately, the field was winnowed to five then four, with Trump last week hinting to CNBC that he had arrived at his choice. Among the finalists were current Governor Christopher Waller, BlackRock bond chief Rick Rieder and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.

"Christopher Waller, Rick Rieder, and others, were interviewed for the Fed position. They all would have been outstanding, and have a great and unlimited future with "TRUMP." Such amazing talent in our Country," Trump said in a separate Truth Social post. 

Rieder, thought to be the favorite as recently as Thursday afternoon, congratulated Warsh on the nomination.

"This has been an incredible honor for me," Rieder said in a statement to CNBC. "I congratulate Kevin on his nomination and think he will serve the institution and our nation very well."

Trump praised Hassett and said he was so good at NEC that he didn't want to move him.

"He is doing such an outstanding job working with me and my team at the White House, that I just didn't want to let him go," he said.

In a CNBC interview, Hassett said he was not disappointed and wished Warsh well.

"I've got my dream job," he said. I think President Trump made a great choice, and I'm really thrilled and humbled by all the kind things he said about me. You know, the bottom line is that the economic team in this White House ... I think we've been hitting on all cylinders, and it's a really bad time to change teams."

From here, the nominee faces a tough road.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has indicated he will block any Fed nominees until the Justice Department probe is finished. 

"Kevin Warsh is a qualified nominee with a deep understanding of monetary policy. However, the Department of Justice continues to pursue a criminal investigation into Chairman Jerome Powell based on committee testimony that no reasonable person could construe as possessing criminal intent," Tillis posted Friday on social media site X.

"My position has not changed: I will oppose the confirmation of any Federal Reserve nominee, including for the position of Chairman, until the DOJ's inquiry into Chairman Powell is fully and transparently resolved," he added.

Hassett told CNBC that the DOJ issue "could get resolved quickly. The White House is highly, highly confident that Kevin Warsh is a great nominee and that he should be confirmed as soon as possible, and every single resource we have at our disposal is behind him, and behind that outcome."

The nomination gained support elsewhere in Congress. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who chairs the Senate banking committee, praised Warsh's "deep knowledge of markets and monetary policy that will be essential in this role."

"The Federal Reserve's decisions touch every American household, from mortgage rates to retirement savings, and President Trump has been clear that bringing accountability and credibility to the Federal Reserve is a priority, and his nomination of Kevin Warsh reflects that focus," Scott said.

The issues, though, are more than political.

Though Trump has insisted that inflation has been vanquished, it remains a good deal from the Fed's 2% target. At the same time, the labor market has slowed, with the economy current in a no-fire, no-hire climate that poses another challenge to Fed policy.

In any event, markets don't expect much action from the new chair: Traders are pricing in at most two more cuts this year before the benchmark fed funds rate lands around 3%, which policymakers have indicates is the long-run "neutral" rate that neither boosts nor hinders economic growth.

Then there's the issue of what happens with Powell.

Though chairs historically have resigned their Fed positions after being removed as chair, that may not be the case this time around. Powell has two years remaining in his governor term, and he could choose to serve it as a bulwark against Trump's efforts to compromise Fed independence. The Supreme Court already is weighing Trump's move to unseat Governor Lisa Cook, a case that ultimately could decide what powers a president has over Fed board members.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Knox, co-owner of Toma Mojo Grill near Minneapolis. This story has been edited for length and clarity.

I run a fast casual chicken restaurant in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb just south of Minneapolis.

With ICE agents in the area, I don't know when — or if — staff will be able to come to work. We all have pretty set schedules, and we're tight-knit. There are only six of us operating this place, seven days a week. And I have concerns: Are my employees going to get stopped on their way to work? Are they going to be hassled or detained? Are they going to come back?

It's a day-by-day thing. Over the past couple of weeks, we've adjusted our hours, opening later and closing earlier. I've been picking up everyone's shifts, but I can't physically work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to close last week so that I could have a day off. I had a doctor's appointment that I couldn't miss.

Some of my employees don't feel comfortable leaving their houses. If they tell me they can't come to the restaurant, my policy, of course, is "no questions asked." I get it. But I'm not a wealthy businessman. If we're not serving guests our food, there's no money coming in, and we can't pay people. I wish that we were at a place where we could offer better PTO benefits, but we're not. That's been hard.

We're just trying to keep our people safe and our employees comfortable. We have a big bay window at the front of the restaurant where the full kitchen is visible. I'm going to make some modifications to the space that will make it harder to see inside. We don't know who's looking in now, or what their purpose is. We put up cameras that we didn't have before — we need to have a record of whatever happens here.

I worry that ICE agents will come to my business to abduct my staff. I also worry that they're going to come enjoy hospitality, and that's going to get out to the public. I can only do what I think is good for me, my staff, and the restaurant. ICE agents are bad for business, no matter which way they come.

Last week, my sales were down about 40% year over year. There are fewer delivery drivers and gig workers, so our takeout food is sitting longer before pickup. Our walk-in business is suffering too: After the sun goes down, we're seeing almost a noticeable drop in sales. That didn't previously happen. Now I have regulars who I haven't seen in weeks.

I went to the strike with my friends and family last week to voice our dissatisfaction with the situation. My employees and I thought it was important to close that day too. Shutting down a restaurant on a Friday in January is devastating. It's the busy day, the day that pays for the rest of the week. That's a big sacrifice — but I know it's important.

What's happening in Minneapolis should horrify every American. There's a very real, pervasive fear about what's going to happen next. That's bad for business. That's bad for life. And I'm worried that there's going to be more loss of life.

Small business owners are brave people. It takes a lot of guts to put everything on the line do something you really want to do, to present a product or service that you think is good enough to charge money for. They don't tend to be the quiet type. I'm not surprised they're speaking up.

A leaked Amazon Web Services organizational chart shows the 15 executives under CEO Matt Garman, plus changes to his reports over the past year.

AWS is Amazon's massive cloud-computing unit. Garman, a longtime Amazon veteran, began leading in June 2024 after running sales and marketing. AWS teams were among those impacted by the company's recent mass layoff targeting 16,000 employees.

Business Insider wrote about Garman's org chart a year ago. A comparison to the previous org chart shows the six new executives who became his reports, the 10 executives who stayed on his org chart, and the two executives who left since January 2025.

Brad Bonnett, VP, Technical Advisor:

Bonnett is an Amazon boomerang who rejoined the company in 2024 after a two-year stint at Google. Bonnett is Garman's new technical advisor. Laura Grit was listed as technical advisor in Garman's January 2025 org chart.

Chet Kapoor, VP, Security Services and Observability:

Kapoor joined Amazon in October from his previous post as CEO and chairman of DataStax, an AI data company acquired by IBM last year.

G2 Krishnamoorthy, VP, AWS Database Services:

Krishnamoorthy runs database services, including Redshift and Aurora. He joined Amazon in 2022 from Meta, where he was most recently head of AI infrastructure.

David Brown, VP, AWS Compute & ML Services, EC2:

Brown is a nearly 19-year Amazon veteran who runs services including Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2, intended to allow customers to easily scale up and down their cloud usage on AWS using virtual servers.

Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, VP, AWS Tech:

Tomsen Bukovec joined AWS in 2010 and is a high-profile executive at Amazon, known for running key services, including Simple Storage Service (S3), the first cloud service AWS introduced.

Swami Sivasubramanian, VP, Agentic AI:

Sivasubramanian became head of Agentic AI in March 2025 and is known for launching popular AI platforms, including Amazon SageMaker and Bedrock.

Prasad Kalyanaraman, VP, AWS Infrastructure Service:

Kalyanaraman has spent more than 20 years at Amazon and took over infrastructure and network services in 2021. Kalyanaraman, in an internal memo viewed by Business Insider after the company announced plans to lay off 16,000 employees, wrote that his org in the past year has "made tremendous progress on scaling to meet unprecedented customer demand."

Colleen Aubrey, SVP, AWS Applied AI Solutions:

Aubrey has spent more than 20 years at Amazon but switched to AWS in May, around the time ex-AWS CEO Adam Selipsky left. She leads the AWS unit responsible for business applications. Aubrey is a member of Jassy's S-team. A calendar invite sent on behalf of Aubrey this week shared details about the company's layoff plans before they were announced.

Elizabeth Baker, VP, Private Pricing:

Baker has been at Amazon since 2016 and runs the unit responsible for custom agreements between AWS and customers, including terms such as usage-based discounts. Baker's past roles include positions at SAP and Oracle.

Greg Pearson, VP, AWS Global Sales:

After Garman became CEO, Pearson integrated global sales teams under Pearson, combining AWS Global Sales, Worldwide Public Sector, the Greater China Region, and Sales Strategy and Operations.

Julia White, VP, Worldwide AWS Marketing:

White joined AWS in November 2025. She was most recently the chief marketing and solutions officer at SAP. Before that, she spent nearly two decades at Microsoft in roles including corporate vice president of product marketing for the Azure cloud unit.

"Julia will join my leadership team and further develop and execute our global marketing strategy, playing a pivotal part in AWS's growth," Garman wrote in an email announcing her appointment.

Laura Grit, VP/Distinguished Engineer:

Grit, an 18-year Amazon veteran, is Garman's previous technical advisor. She previously led Amazon.com's migration from on-premise data centers to AWS cloud services.

Ruba Borno, VP, AWS Specialists & Partners:

Borno has been at AWS since 2021. When Garman took over, he put Borno in charge of a new unit combining its Channels and Alliances team, responsible for relationships between global partners and customers, and its Worldwide Specialist Organization, which connects service teams to customers.

Uwem Ukpong, VP, AWS Industries:

Ukpong now leads the organization responsible for industry-specific AWS products for customers, succeeding Kathrin Renz, who left in December.

Werner Vogels, VP and CTO:

Vogels is technically the chief technology officer of Amazon overall, but he has another important role within AWS, acting as one of the public faces of the company's cloud business and technical infrastructure.

Missing from Garman's latest organizational chart are Peter DeSantis, previously listed as senior vice president of AWS Utility Computing, and Kathrin Renz, ex-VP of AWS Industries. DeSantis, this month, took on a new role overseeing a new AI organization, and Renz left the company in December, according to a LinkedIn post.

Nvidia's meteoric stock surge has done more than reward investors; it has created vast wealth for some long-standing employees.

While Nvidia's workforce is relatively small compared to other tech giants, with just 36,000 employees as of early 2025, stock appreciation during the AI boom has turned certain ordinary contributors into millionaires, according to pay data tracked by Levels.fyi.

Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang takes a hands-on approach to employee compensation.

"I review everybody's compensation up to this day at the end of every cycle," Huang said on an episode of the "All-In" podcast in July.

Huang also said on the podcast that he's "created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world."

Still, employees who joined Nvidia earlier are likelier to have reaped rewards than newer hires—a pay disparity that employees sometimes openly discuss.

Nvidia doesn't disclose salary data for its workforce, though publicly available work visa filings offer one of the few empirical glimpses into how much it pays for key roles. The figures come from filings that all companies submit to the Labor Department to sponsor H-1B visas, which Huang has stressed Nvidia will continue to sponsor and cover all associated fees amid evolving policies.

The figures only reflect base pay — not the equity and bonuses that typically comprise total compensation packages.

Nvidia received roughly 1,900 certified H-1B applications in fiscal 2025, with some of the 25 most frequent roles including software engineers, research scientists, and product managers.

Software engineers can make anywhere from $92,000 to $425,500 in base pay, while research scientists can make from $104,000 to $431,250, and product managers can make from $131,029 to $379,500.

Big Tech salaries amid the AI boom have seen companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft forking over similar figures.

Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

The global memory chip shortage is catching up with Apple, Tim Cook says.

The Apple CEO said on the company's first-quarter earnings call that Apple is beginning to feel the effects of the memory shortage crisis, with rising prices expected to put pressure on margins ahead.

The warning comes amid blockbuster demand for Apple's newest products. Customer response to the latest iPhone lineup "exceeded our expectations," with iPhone revenue jumping 23%, Cook said on the call Thursday.

Apple reported revenue of $143.76 billion and earnings per share of $2.84, beating analyst estimates.

The staggering iPhone demand left Apple exiting the December quarter with "very lean" inventory, pushing the company into what Cook described as "supply chase mode."

Cook said the biggest constraint is the limited access to advanced chipmaking nodes used to produce Apple's system-on-a-chip processors. Higher demand has also reduced flexibility across Apple's supply chain, he said.

Memory shortages played a minimal role in Apple's December-quarter margins, but their impact is expected to grow, Cook added.

The company expects memory costs to weigh more heavily on margins in the second quarter, contributing to its forecast gross margin range of 48% to 49%. Apple posted a gross margin of about 48% in the December quarter.

"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly," Cook said. "As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that."

Apple's stock price rose about 2% after hours following the results on Thursday.

Cook's comments come as the tech industry grapples with a worsening global shortage of memory chips.

AI companies, smartphone makers, and PC manufacturers are competing for the same pool of memory components, which are critical not just for consumer electronics but also for powering large language models and other AI systems. That surge in demand has sent prices climbing.

At CES 2026 last month, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, described the memory storage market as "completely unserved."

"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs," he said at CES with analysts.

"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high," he added, referring to AI storage needs.

The Korea Economic Daily reported in January that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are seeking server DRAM price hikes of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Market analysis firm Counterpoint also said last month that memory prices could climb as much as 40% through the second quarter of 2026.

"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply," an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.

The rapid buildout of AI infrastructure marks a break from the industry's traditional "boom-and-bust cycles."

"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term," the analyst added.

The bubble in precious metals might have popped this week, with silver's violent decline on Friday leading the group lower.

Having touched a new record of $120 per ounce earlier in the session, silver has pulled back to $75 in U.S. afternoon hours, now lower by 35% for the day. Gold — which as recently as Sunday had never seen $5,000 per ounce — climbed to $5,600 at one point Thursday, but has now retreated to $4,718, down 12% for the day.

Platinum is lower by 24% and palladium by 20%.

To put silver's move in perspective, it's given back nearly its entire massive January gain in the space of a few hours. While crypto bulls might be used to such action, only those precious metals traders who were around during the days of the Hunt Brothers in 1980 will be familiar with that sort of downside volatility.

U.S. stocks are selling off as well, the Nasdaq down 1.25% and S&P 500 0.9%.

After plunging earlier in the week, cryptocurrencies, by comparison, are moving somewhat sideways on Friday, holding above Thursday evening's panicky lows. Bitcoin was trading around $83,000 recently versus its overnight bottom of $81,000.

The action in markets has been volatile all week, but this latest bout appears to have been set off by President Trump's picking Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair. Conventional thinking at the moment says Warsh was a somewhat hawkish pick, thus perhaps setting off the selling in risk assets.

Paul Howard, director at trading firm Wincent, spoke for many crypto bulls, saying the parabolic move in commodities in recent months had siphoned risk capital from crypto markets. That dynamic may now be shifting.

"Cryptocurrency markets have been the victim of risk capital flowing into the still popular commodities trade," he said. He noted growing interest in options markets for upside exposure in February, with the 105,000 BTC calls among the most actively traded contracts.

"The outlook indicates what a lot of crypto traders are feeling right now — that their market is long overdue a commodity-style catch-up," Howard added.

“What was meant to be a bullish move for the markets appears to have coincided with a broad risk sell-off,” Howard said of the nomination of Kevin Warsh. “The reaction may be more of a knee-jerk as markets recalibrate.”

Having touched a new record of $120 per ounce earlier in the session, silver has pulled back to $75 in U.S. afternoon hours, now lower by 35% for the day. Gold — which as recently as Sunday had never seen $5,000 per ounce — climbed to $5,600 at one point Thursday, but has now retreated to $4,718, down 12% for the day.

Platinum is lower by 24% and palladium by 20%.

To put silver's move in perspective, it's given back nearly its entire massive January gain in the space of a few hours. While crypto bulls might be used to such action, only those precious metals traders who were around during the days of the Hunt Brothers in 1980 will be familiar with that sort of downside volatility.

U.S. stocks are selling off as well, the Nasdaq down 1.25% and S&P 500 0.9%.

After plunging earlier in the week, cryptocurrencies, by comparison, are moving somewhat sideways on Friday, holding above Thursday evening's panicky lows. Bitcoin was trading around $83,000 recently versus its overnight bottom of $81,000.

The action in markets has been volatile all week, but this latest bout appears to have been set off by President Trump's picking Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair. Conventional thinking at the moment says Warsh was a somewhat hawkish pick, thus perhaps setting off the selling in risk assets.

Paul Howard, director at trading firm Wincent, spoke for many crypto bulls, saying the parabolic move in commodities in recent months had siphoned risk capital from crypto markets. That dynamic may now be shifting.

"Cryptocurrency markets have been the victim of risk capital flowing into the still popular commodities trade," he said. He noted growing interest in options markets for upside exposure in February, with the 105,000 BTC calls among the most actively traded contracts.

"The outlook indicates what a lot of crypto traders are feeling right now — that their market is long overdue a commodity-style catch-up," Howard added.

“What was meant to be a bullish move for the markets appears to have coincided with a broad risk sell-off,” Howard said of the nomination of Kevin Warsh. “The reaction may be more of a knee-jerk as markets recalibrate.”

Dubai, United Arab Emirates, January 30th, 2026, Chainwire

Otters, a fast-growing Telegram Mini App built on the TON blockchain, is redefining how everyday users discover, engage with, and adopt Web3 through simple, social, and rewarding experiences.

Built natively inside Telegram, Otters removes the friction that has historically kept millions of users away from crypto. Instead of wallets, bridges, and complex onboarding flows, Otters introduces Web3 through familiar mechanics like daily rewards, short farming cycles, social competition, and in-app mini games, all accessible in just a few taps.

Since launch, Otters has attracted tens of thousands of users organically, driven by strong daily engagement and repeat usage. The app is designed to feel intuitive for newcomers while still offering real on-chain value for experienced users.

Turning Crypto Onboarding Into a Game

At its core, Otters transforms Web3 participation into something playful and social. Users earn Otters Coins through daily check-ins, short farming sessions, slot-style Spin and Earn gameplay, and community-driven activities like referrals and leaderboards.

Unlike many Telegram mini apps that focus only on speculative rewards, Otters prioritizes habit-forming engagement and long-term retention. Each interaction is designed to be lightweight, enjoyable, and easy to understand, lowering the psychological barrier to Web3 adoption.

TON Badge Brings Verification and Utility On-Chain

One of Otters' most notable innovations is the TON Badge, a premium on-chain verification feature. By completing a small TON transaction through the integrated wallet, users unlock a verified badge that appears beside their username inside the app.

The TON Badge is more than cosmetic. It enables access to peer-to-peer Quick Share transfers, enhances trust within the community, and establishes a verified identity layer inside Telegram. Otters is among the first Telegram Mini Apps to successfully gamify user verification and permissioned P2P access using on-chain mechanics.

In-App NFT Collection Store Goes Live

Otters has recently launched its in-app NFT Collection Store, allowing users to mint official Otters NFT collections directly on the TON blockchain without leaving Telegram.

Through the store, users can purchase and mint NFTs that are delivered straight to their connected wallet on-chain. This approach removes the need for external marketplaces or complex minting steps, making NFT ownership accessible to a broader audience while preserving full on-chain transparency.

The NFT Store marks a key milestone in Otters' roadmap, expanding the ecosystem beyond rewards and gameplay into digital ownership and long-term utility.

A Platform Designed for Scale

Otters is built with scalability in mind. The app already supports TON wallet connections, on-chain transactions, premium features, and modular reward systems. Upcoming releases include the $OTR token generation event, a full claiming system, deeper ecosystem partnerships, and listings across both centralized and decentralized exchanges.

The team is also preparing Otters v2, a major application rebuild focused on performance, design consistency, and expanded social mechanics.

Otters is currently opening discussions with strategic partners and early-stage investors to accelerate growth, strengthen liquidity planning, and expand distribution ahead of its token launch.

About Otters

Otters is a social gaming and Web3 onboarding platform built inside Telegram and powered by the TON blockchain. By combining gamification, social interaction, and real on-chain utility, Otters makes crypto accessible, engaging, and intuitive for the next wave of users.

For more information, users can visit the Otters Telegram Mini App or follow official Otters community channels.

Tether, the world's largest stablecoin issuer, is storing gold in a Cold War-era nuclear bunker in Switzerland. The company is stockpiling more than a ton of the precious metal every week in the Swiss mountains to back its gold-pegged XAUT Token—an attention-grabbing security measure once employed by a Bitcoin firm from crypto's early days.

Tether currently owns an estimated $24 billion in gold, the most of any holder outside of governments, central banks, and major ETFs. As a new Fortune magazine feature reveals, the gold hoarding reflects a belief on the part of Tether's CEO that Western economies are unraveling and that his firm can be an anchor of stability in an unstable world. 

The company's use of Swiss vaults to hold its approximately 140 tons of gold—which backs its gold token but also forms part of its own treasury—coincides with a record precious metals rally. 

This isn't the first time the crypto world has flocked to Switzerland. One of the first crypto custody firms, Xapo, would store customers' Bitcoin in a bunker under a Swiss mountain. The company was founded by Argentine Wences Casares, who rubbed elbows with the original Bitcoin crowd, in 2013. He sold the custody portion of the business to Coinbase in 2019. 

During this rally, gold has climbed 83% in the last year, even as Bitcoin—the so-called “digital gold—posted a 20% decline. The precious metal has even beaten the original cryptocurrency over the long term, as gold is up 174% in the last five years, while Bitcoin is up 142% since then. 

Investors are betting against the dollar, which is supposed to be a recipe for success for those in the crypto world. Instead, traders are pouring money into gold and leaving Bitcoin behind. Younger investors have touted cryptocurrency as the future of finance and a pathway to get richer, quicker. To their disgust, buyers of gold, typically associated with older generations, are cashing in winnings. 

Last year was a letdown for crypto enthusiasts, and 2026 isn't looking much better. Bitcoin is down nearly 35% since October to its current price of about $83,000 according to Binance. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana are also down 30% and 37%, respectively, in the last three months. 

One analyst argues that Bitcoin could sink even more, given the turbulent macroeconomic environment. “I do not think that low 70s is out of the question in Bitcoin – not today specifically, going to depend a lot on what happens with Iran and general overall sentiment,” said Russell Thompson, CIO of Hilbert Group.

Oops, something went wrong

Vitalik Buterin has withdrawn 16,384 ETH (c. $44.7 million) to support the ongoing growth and development of Ethereum, declaring that the Ethereum Foundation has entered a period of “mild austerity” in which some goals may be prioritized over others.

In a lengthy tweet, the Ethereum co-founder argues that such austerity is necessary for the Foundation to achieve two interrelated goals: the realization of an “aggressive” roadmap that advances Ethereum's utility as a decentralized “world computer”; and the protection of users' ability to access Ethereum “with self-sovereignty, security and privacy.”

Coming as the price of Ethereum falls to a six-month low of $2,710, Buterin's post also revealed that he will taking more of a leading role in special development projects, with a particular focus on producing open-source applications in such areas as finance, communication, governance, operating systems, biotech, and secure hardware.

He said, “If you have seen [...] my own enthusiasm and use for privacy-preserving, walkaway-test-friendly and local-first software (including operating systems), then you know the general spirit of what I am planning to support.”

It was here that Buterin noted he had withdrawn 16,384 ETH from his own funds to pursue such goals “over the next few years,” and that he will also seek out “decentralized staking options” in order to grow the pool of available funds.

Decrypt has reached out to the Ethereum Foundation for comment.

While the use of the term “austerity” may potentially alarm some observers, particularly during a bearish market, some commentators emphasize that Buterin's intent is much more about directing funding to valuable R&D activities than limiting funding altogether.

“I read the comment as one about focus, on building the protocol in a particular direction,” said Lex Sokolin, Managing Partner at Generative Ventures, and the former chief economist at ConsenSys.

Speaking to Decrypt, Sokolin noted how ETH has largely traded sideways over the past few years, and that Buterin's comments are a sign of recognition that “narrative-driven investment” is no longer very effective as a source of growth for onchain projects and Ethereum more generally.

“All things have to show fundamentals, not just conferences and unicorns,” he said. “We have seen compression in value in prior R&D ideas like restaking, zero-knowledge L2s, and so on.”

Ethereum's Oldest Crisis Reborn as a $220 Million Security Fund

Sokolin also explained that, with the wider market mostly focused on real-world assets, stablecoins and other commercial activities, the Ethereum Foundation will have to step in to fund things that may not be commercially viable off the bat, but that are still essential to Ethereum's development.

“I think Vitalik will fund projects that are important to him—open source, privacy and self sovereignty focused—outside of the Ethereum Foundation,” he explained.

The market was initially jolted by the sudden news of President Donald Trump naming Kevin Warsh as his choice for the next Federal Reserve chair, ending a month-long saga of guessing game.

The U.S. dollar rallied, bitcoin fell, and the equity market became volatile when the news broke; while the market might have stabilized a bit for now, the uncertainty is still gripping the traders across all asset classes.

So who is Kevin Warsh, and more importantly, how will his leadership shape the future of monetary policy and crypto?

Kevin Maxwell Warsh is a former U.S. Federal Reserve governor who served from 2006 to 2011 and played a senior role during the 2008 global financial crisis, including acting as a key liaison between the Fed and financial markets.

Before joining the central bank, Warsh worked at Morgan Stanley and served in the George W. Bush administration as Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Executive Secretary of the National Economic Council, giving him experience spanning Wall Street and Washington.

After leaving the Fed, Warsh became a visiting fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, where he has written extensively on monetary policy, central bank credibility and what he views as the long-term risks of prolonged balance-sheet expansion by central banks.

It's worth noting here that while the nomination spooked the market and bitcoin, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell — whose second four-year term expires on May 15, 2026 — is eligible to remain on the Fed's Board of Governors until Jan. 31, 2028. Warsh must still be confirmed by the Senate before assuming the role, but a vacancy created by Governor Stephen Miran's expiring temporary term on Jan. 31, 2026 could allow him to join the board ahead of May.

Warsh's appointment has drawn particular scrutiny from digital-asset investors — at least initially — given his long-held views on monetary discipline and skepticism toward bitcoin's role as money.

While the concern is not with Warsh personally, his background has led many market participants to view him as potentially bearish for bitcoin and other risk assets. He is broadly viewed as favoring monetary discipline, higher real rates, and a smaller Fed balance sheet, all of which oppose a liquidity-heavy environment that has historically backed risk assets.

So what are his ties to crypto?

First, let's take a look at what he said about bitcoin previously.

In public commentary in 2015, Warsh approached bitcoin and cryptocurrencies primarily through a monetary-policy lens, expressing skepticism about their use as stable mediums of exchange while acknowledging the potential of blockchain technology.

“The underlying technology in that white paper, it's just software,” Warsh said during a video conversation with Stanley Drukenmiller. “It's just the newest, coolest software that will provide us the opportunity to do things we could never have done before."

While acknowledging all software can be used for good and for evil, Warsh said that by building it here in the US, that gives us the opportunity to be more productive and create something very special over the next decade…”

At one point in the conversation with the billionaire hedge fund manager and his former colleague, Warsh told Drukenmiller, “You made reference to Bitcoin and I thought I heard a little condescension in your voice, that people are buying bitcoin.”

He went on to make a case in favour of bitcoin, saying “it could provide market discipline, it could tell the world that things need to be fixed.” He also said he thinks of “bitcoin as a lot of things, but certainly with every passing day it's getting new life as an alternative currency.”

While the interview is from 2015, when bitcoin was still seen as dangerous and mostly used for illegal activities, a lot has changed in the last eleven years. Now, the U.S. has a pro-crypto government, there is legislation in the works to create a legal framework for digital assets, and, most importantly, crypto has become too big to ignore, even for Wall Street giants.

The potential future Fed chair has argued that central banks must engage with digital money, including considering a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) to counter bitcoin and rival China's digital yuan. Worth noting that CBDC is a hotly debated topic in the crypto community due to privacy concerns.

He also said cryptocurrency was nothing more than "software pretending to be money.” He categorized cryptocurrencies as a symptom of "speculative excess" driven by loose monetary policy and argued that Bitcoin's rise was largely a derivative of the "global dollar flood" and that, as liquidity tightens, such assets are likely to lose their appeal.

Warsh also had close ties with crypto in general.

Warsh has drawn attention in crypto circles for his early involvement with digital-asset firms, including Bitwise Asset Management, a crypto index fund provider. Warsh was an investor in a cryptocurrency project called Basis, an algorithmic central bank. He also served as an adviser for Electric Capital, a VC firm focused on crypto, blockchain and fintech.

Market analysts covering crypto have said Warsh's policy outlook, which emphasizes institutional credibility and monetary discipline, could matter for liquidity conditions affecting risk assets such as bitcoin.

Warsh is not a crypto evangelist, but has expressed a nuanced, pragmatic stance on innovation and regulation. Analysts view him as cautious about private crypto volatility and as more focused on systemic financial stability than on championing unregulated markets.

While criticizing its use as money, Warsh has conceded that bitcoin could potentially serve as a "sustainable store of value, like gold." However, he maintains that its boom-and-bust cycles are speculative and may foretell "heightened market volatility" across broader financial assets.

“Warsh is not viewed as hostile to crypto, and the prospect of a new Fed Chair perceived as more inclined toward rate cuts could trigger a short-term relief rally across risk assets,” Market analyst and Adlunam founder Jason Fernandes said.

“However, without a genuine macroeconomic justification for easing, any such move will be met with skepticism and sold into,” Fernandes added.

Pudgy Penguins: A New Blueprint for Tokenized Culture

Pudgy Penguins is building a multi-vertical consumer IP platform — combining phygital products, games, NFTs and PENGU to monetize culture at scale.

What to know: 

Pudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token.

The ecosystem now spans phygital products (> $13M retail sales and >1M units sold), games and experiences (Pudgy Party surpassed 500k downloads in two weeks), and a widely distributed token (airdropped to 6M+ wallets). While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.

Dieppe, New Brunswick--(Newsfile Corp. - January 30, 2026) - Canadian Gold Resources Ltd. CAN ("Canadian Gold" or the "Company") is very pleased to announce that, on January 29, 2026, it completed the sale of 7,000,000 non flow-through units (an "NFT Unit") at a price of $0.15 per NFT Unit under its previously announced listed issuer financing exemption offering (the "LIFE Offering") (see the Company's news release dated December 29, 2025) for gross proceeds of $1,050,000.

Each NFT Unit is comprised of one common share (a "Common Share") and one share purchase warrant (a "Warrant"), each Warrant entitling the holder to acquire one additional Common Share of the Company at a price of $0.22 per share for a period of 36 months from the date of issuance provided, however, that should the closing price at which the Common Shares trade on the TSXV (or any such other stock exchange in Canada as the Common Shares may trade at the applicable time) exceed $0.45 for ten (10) consecutive trading days at any time following the date that is four months and one day after the date of issuance, the Company may accelerate the warrant term (the "Reduced Warrant Term") such that the Warrants shall expire on the date which is 30 business days following the date a press release is issued by the Company announcing the Reduced Warrant Term.

In connection with the sale of the NFT Units, the Company paid $79,640 cash finder's fees and issued 530,933 finder's warrants (each a "Finder's Warrant") to eligible arm's length parties. Each Finder's Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Common Share at a price of $0.15 for a period of 36 months from the date of issuance. The Finder's Warrants are subject to the same acceleration provisions as the Warrants.

The net proceeds from the sale of the NFT Units will be used for the purchase of assets for use on the Company's Lac Arsenault project, the Robidoux project and VG Boulder project as well as corporate overhead expenditures which do not qualify as flow-through expenses for funds raised through the sale of flow-through units.

Combined with the $2,016,297.90 raised on December 31, 2025 through the sale of flow-through units under the LIFE Offering and a concurrent non-brokered private placement (see the Company's news release dated January 2, 2026), the Company has now raised gross proceeds of $3,066,297.90 in the last 30 days.

Closing of the LIFE Offering is subject to final acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange.

Oops, something went wrong

President Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as Chairman of the Federal Reserve on Friday, selecting a candidate who views bitcoin as a strategic tool for central banks rather than a threat to the financial system or a competitor to the dollar.

Warsh noted in a Hoover Institution interview last year that price movements can indicate when the Federal Reserve is mismanaging the economy or ignoring inflation signals.

“I think it can often be a very good policeman for policy,” Warsh said.

Trump announced the selection on Truth Social, praising Warsh's previous tenure on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and his background in economics and finance.

Warsh, a former Morgan Stanley banker and Hoover Institution fellow, has distinguished himself from traditional central bankers through a constructive stance on cryptocurrency.

The nominee argued in a recent interview that Bitcoin serves a disciplinary function for monetary policy.

He explicitly disagreed with the late investor Charlie Munger, who previously characterized Bitcoin as “evil” because it undermines the Federal Reserve's control.

Warsh instead said that bitcoin provides necessary “market discipline” for the financial system, describing it as an “important asset” capable of signaling when policymakers make errors.

The nominee rejected the anxiety that frequently characterizes regulatory perspectives on the sector.

“Bitcoin does not make me nervous,” Warsh stated directly when asked about the potential risks of the asset class.

He acknowledged his early exposure to the technology in 2011 through venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, but admitted he initially missed its significance.

He continued to draw a clear distinction between the technology's utility and the sovereignty of the dollar, but clarified that, while he values Bitcoin, he believes “it is not a substitute [for] the dollar.”

This position suggests he views cryptocurrency not as a replacement for daily transactions or global dominance, but as a parallel asset class.

Warsh also framed the cryptocurrency industry as a matter of national economic competitiveness, and he emphasized that the locus of software development for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency broadly is in the United States.

Warsh previously served as the youngest Governor in Federal Reserve history at age 35, serving from 2006 until 2011.

Trump highlighted Warsh's role managing the Board's operations and his experience as the Federal Reserve's representative to the G-20.

“I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post announcing the nomination (emphasis his).

On January 28, 2026, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the arrest of a teacher at La Costa Canyon High School in Carlsbad, California, on charges related to the possession and attempted possession of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). According to the California Department of Justice, the defendant attempted to purchase CSAM online, which led to a search warrant, seizure of electronic devices, and multiple criminal counts. The Attorney General's Office emphasized the importance of strong interagency partnerships in keeping communities safe.

TRM Labs is proud to support the California Department of Justice and its law enforcement partners in this investigation and in their ongoing efforts to disrupt the production, distribution, and financing of child exploitation material. This investigation, which included tracing blockchain transactions to and from known CSAM sellers, is a powerful example of law enforcement leveraging blockchain intelligence to identify and disrupt individuals engaged in the purchase, sale, and distribution of CSAM.

Historically, CSAM investigations are among the most difficult and resource-intensive cases in law enforcement. They often require investigators to infiltrate encrypted forums, rely on confidential sources, and spend extensive time and resources identifying offenders and safeguarding victims. Blockchain intelligence can change the starting point and accelerate the identification of perpetrators. When cryptocurrency is used as a payment rail, investigators can begin with financial traces, build an evidentiary path from known seller infrastructure to suspected purchasers, and use that financial trail to support lawful process, including search warrants and device seizures.

The Carlsbad arrest is the second such case in just the last few weeks involving an educator allegedly using cryptocurrency to procure CSAM online. Earlier this month, Indianapolis Police arrested Julian Wachner on similar allegations. The probable cause affidavit filed in the Wachner matter provides a clear, step-by-step blueprint for how blockchain tracing is operationalized in CSAM investigations when digital assets are used.

The entry point is frequently a compliance-driven signal rather than a purely undercover discovery. In the Wachner matter, the investigation began with a CyberTip, triggered by a virtual asset service provider report indicating suspected use of cryptocurrency to purchase CSAM. That matters because it underscores a key reality: regulated platforms, when they detect patterns or exposure consistent with CSAM-related typologies, can generate actionable leads that allow investigators to move quickly.

From there, the tracing flow is typically built in layers.

First, investigators learn the beneficial person behind a cryptocurrency transaction through an exchange's records and ‘Know-Your-Customer' details. That provides a lawful anchor for the analysis: the suspect is not identified by a wallet address alone, but through records tying account activity to an individual.

Next, investigators identify the on-chain transfers from the subject's account to the illicit CSAM seller's address. In the Wachner affidavit, investigators describe transfers from a custodial exchange, across multiple intermediary hops, and ultimately to a CSAM seller's address:

The affidavit describes how TRM documented the CSAM's seller's address as CSAM; in this case, backed up by screenshots, on-chain patterns, and transactions consistent with obfuscation techniques. 

These cases illustrate a growing intersection of child exploitation investigations and financial technology. For law enforcement, the practical implication is that blockchain intelligence can help identify suspects, map networks, and accelerate investigative disruptions more efficiently, particularly when investigators already have exposure points to known seller infrastructure. For the financial and compliance ecosystem, the implication is that platform monitoring and alerting can serve as a critical early warning system, surfacing activity that may otherwise remain buried behind encrypted channels.

While the two arrests occurred in different jurisdictions and involved different circumstances, the shared thread described by authorities is the use of cryptocurrency as a payment method to access CSAM online.

That overlap matters for two reasons. First, it suggests certain seller ecosystems have normalized crypto as a payment mechanism, sometimes relying on token-based purchasing and deposit-address structures. Second, it shows why the crypto angle is not simply that digital assets can be used in crimes. It is that the public, immutable nature of many blockchains can produce investigative advantages when paired with compliance monitoring, lawful process, and expert analysis.

Officials emphasize that educators and other trusted community figures are not immune from scrutiny when evidence points to online abuse material, and that cryptocurrency is not beyond the reach of law enforcement. In cases where digital assets are used, tracing and analytics can help connect the dots between pseudonymous transactions and real-world actors, supporting interagency investigations and enabling timely action to disrupt exploitation networks.

Some CSAM sellers use digital assets because they believe crypto provides anonymity, and recent arrests suggest that even trusted community figures, including educators, have allegedly exploited these payment methods to access abuse material online.

Blockchain intelligence allows investigators to trace immutable transactions between suspected purchasers and known CSAM seller infrastructure, map networks, identify patterns, and generate financial evidence that supports lawful process.

Regulated platforms can generate CyberTips or suspicious activity reports when CSAM-related typologies are detected, providing investigators an early entry point and tying blockchain activity to real-world identities through KYC records.

CSAM investigations often involve encrypted forums, anonymous networks, and horrific content, requiring intensive investigative resources. Blockchain tracing can help shift the starting point from hidden communications to financial evidence.

The Wachner probable cause affidavit provides a real-world blueprint of how investigators traced funds from an exchange through intermediary hops to addresses linked to CSAM sellers, using blockchain analytics to support attribution, warrants, and enforcement action.

Together, these cases highlight both the continued use of cryptocurrency in facilitating CSAM-related commerce and the increasing ability of law enforcement, using blockchain intelligence and interagency collaboration, to identify perpetrators and disrupt exploitation networks.

Coin Metrics data shows the top 10 alts now hold about 82% of the market cap excluding Bitcoin. That leaves the long tail fighting for scraps even in “recoveries.”

Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry. His expertise primarily focuses on the Brazilian blockchain ecosystem and developments in decentralized finance (DeFi).

This is a familiar story for those who have been in crypto for a while. Bitcoin crashes, rebounds, and a few altcoins follow after. Yet, that small- or medium-cap crypto with promising fundamentals never followed through.

The question investors won't say aloud: Why did my token never catch the recovery bid?

The answer has less to do with the coin's fundamentals and more to do with how crypto's microstructure has fundamentally reshaped itself.

The “investable altcoin market” has contracted into a top-heavy pyramid in which new liquidity doesn't rotate down the capitalization curve. Instead, it concentrates in majors and occasionally in ETF-credible large caps, while the long tail gets brief, thin narrative pops that fade within weeks.

The math is brutal. Top 10 altcoins now command roughly 82% of the altcoin market cap excluding Bitcoin, per Coin Metrics analyst Tanay Ved. That's up from a range of 69-73% maintained across 2020-2024, and well above the 64% low reached during the 2021 bull run.

This isn't a temporary flight to quality during a bear market, but a structural reordering. The breadth that defined “alt season” has evaporated. Even when alts rise, most beta accrues to the top 10, not the tail.

The investable universe itself has shrunk. Coin Metrics tracks that altcoins with market caps above $1 billion fell from roughly 105 at the 2021 peak to just 58.

The headline statistic that “thousands of tokens exist” is misleading, as the liquid, scalable set has contracted by nearly half. The concentration math is: if the top 10 already own 82% of the market cap, the entire “everything else” bucket represents just 18%.

In a recovery where capital allocation rules don't change, most marginal dollars land in the top bucket. The long tail competes for leftovers while absorbing ongoing emissions and unlocks.

Recoveries no longer function as a “rising tide lifts all boats” effect because liquidity enters crypto through channels that don't naturally spill into microcaps.

Wintermute's 2025 OTC report argues that how capital entered crypto mattered as much as how much came in. ETFs and digital asset treasury vehicles concentrate flows into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a narrow set of large caps, with limited organic rotation into the broader token universe.

Spot Bitcoin ETF assets under management hover around $122 billion at the current $85,000 price level. The funnel at the top of the stack is massive, but it doesn't connect to microcaps.

The narrative half-life has shortened dramatically.

Wintermute found that the average altcoin rally lasted approximately 19 days in 2025, down from 61 days in 2024. This reflects reduced follow-through and insufficient liquidity to sustain the themes beyond the initial burst.

Small caps don't just need a pump, but also need time and depth to build sustained bids. Yet, the window keeps shrinking.

The market's “liquidity surface” is thinner than it looks. CCData's December 2025 exchange review reports that combined spot and derivatives volumes fell 26.4% to $5.79 trillion, the lowest level since October 2024.

Execution metrics focused on 1% market depth indicate that when depth declines, the same trade size moves the price more violently and makes follow-through more difficult. Small caps can go up in these conditions, but they just can't stay up.

Crypto remains trapped in its risk-on cage. During recent stress, the S&P 500 fell roughly 1.5%, gold shed 1%, while Bitcoin dropped 5%.

This movement reinforces that crypto continues to behave as leveraged beta for risk assets.

VanEck noted that Bitcoin's 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 fell to approximately 0.18, one of the lowest readings of the past year, while Bitcoin's correlation with gold rose.

This unstable relationship makes institutional allocators wary of anything below the majors when risk appetite fragments.

Equities sit at or near all-time highs, with the S&P 500 sitting at 6,927.40 after crossing 7,000 on AI optimism and expectations of Federal Reserve cuts.

Meanwhile, the crypto market cap slid below $3 trillion, down by 5.1%. The valuation disparity amplifies caution.

Stablecoin “dry powder” isn't expanding as it did before, reaching an all-time high above $310 billion in mid-January, before contracting to $308 billion. If stablecoin supply isn't growing, the market fights over a relatively fixed pool of deployable liquidity, and it crowds into liquid names.

Small tokens face an additional headwind that majors absorb more easily: supply unlocks and dilution.

99Bitcoins flagged roughly $1.69 billion in token unlocks over a single week in early January 2026, highlighting near-term sell pressure.

Market maker Keyrock's analysis found that token unlocks frequently create downward price pressure, with effects beginning weeks before the unlock.

That small-cap coin isn't only just waiting for buyers, but it is also manufacturing new supply.

Additionally, small-cap tokens reached a four-year low, indicating that the alt season thesis is dead. The same fate applies to the possibility of a recovery when Bitcoin rebounds.

The data has only tightened since.

The path forward splits into three distinct scenarios, each with observable tells.

An institution-led recovery, which is the most probable path if ETFs remain the primary on-ramp, will involve Bitcoin and Ethereum outperforming, with large caps leading while small caps lag and breadth remaining narrow.

The top-10 alt share will remain above 80%, centralized exchange volumes will remain muted, and rally durations will remain compressed to weeks rather than months. This scenario preserves the current structure.

A retail-led breadth return requires a new inflow source and a longer narrative half-life. The signals: stablecoin supply growing materially rather than staying flat, more tokens re-entering the “>$1 billion investable” set and reversing Coin Metrics' documented shrinkage, and narrative cycles lengthening back toward 2024-style durations.

This scenario requires ammunition: an expanding stablecoin supply that creates a pool that can rotate down the cap curve.

A liquidity shock or a risk-off continuation represents the worst-case scenario. Majors absorb what liquidity remains, the tail bleeds via unlocks and emissions, and random pumps get even shorter.

This scenario will include cross-asset signals such as gold bid versus Bitcoin weakness, large unlock weeks landing into thin depth, and further compression of rally windows. This scenario accelerates concentration.

Wintermute itself points to 2026 catalysts for broader participation: ETF and digital-asset treasury mandates expanding beyond major asset managers, Bitcoin and Ethereum wealth effects creating rotation appetite, and retail mindshare returning.

These are the conditions, not guarantees, under which small caps might catch a sustained bid.

Tokens outside the top 10 now require a different recovery than Bitcoin.

They need expanding stablecoin ammunition, a longer narrative half-life, and enough depth to absorb new supply. Without those conditions, the rebound stays concentrated in majors.

The market has revealed its preference structure: when capital is scarce, it seeks liquidity and credibility. The top 10 provide both. The long tail provides neither.

The 82% concentration figure isn't just a statistic, but a new default. Reversing it requires either a substantial expansion of deployable capital or a fundamental shift in how institutional and retail capital flows into crypto.

Until one of those conditions materializes, small-cap holders face a market structure that works against them by design. The “alt season” thesis didn't just die, it was buried under a collapsing liquidity pyramid where only the apex thrives.

It's reasonable to say that this coin isn't behaving like a safe harbor asset right now.

Bitcoin (BTC +0.46%) is having one of those periods that make even its evangelists a bit tense. It's down by 17% over the last 12 months as I write this, and 22% over the last three months. It seems to sink no matter what the headlines are saying about politics, the economy, or international relations. Sentiment about the coin hasn't been this bad in years.

But none of that will stop me from buying even more of it. Here's why.

Image source: Getty Images.

The short-term mechanism of Bitcoin getting beaten down is quite simple. For the last 12 months, there's been a new problem every week or so.

In that period, the market has been perpetually repricing the coin relative to the latest geopolitical conflicts, tariff risks, and other economic phenomena in real time. There has been absolutely no shortage of these chaotic happenings, and there will probably not be any reprieve for a few years. And when these threats escalate, investors tend to trim risk assets like Bitcoin.

But if you're buying an asset to hold it for years, the headlines in any given week are really not all that important. After all, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it isn't a fiat currency that a government can just print more of. And, as its supply gets even harder to produce every four years thanks to its halvings, today's coins are very likely to be cheaper than those in the future, when miners will need to be compensated for the additional effort needed.

This is to say that no matter how mediocre its performance has been in these turbulent times, its core investment thesis still holds as strong as ever. I expect the coin's price to be significantly higher within a few years.

Nonetheless, there is one risk that I view as being potentially deadly for Bitcoin, and it's something I am paying very close attention to.

At some point in the future, likely more than five years from now, a quantum computer might be powerful enough to crack Bitcoin's encryption and steal coins. That'd be a massive problem for every holder if it happens.

But, it's already theoretically possible to mitigate this threat. Bitcoin has to choose and deploy its own mitigation path, which will take some time, but  its developer community is already in the process of evaluating what the best course of action is.

In the long run, I expect Bitcoin to navigate this obstacle, and that's why I still have the confidence to keep buying it now.

Bitcoin can behave badly this week without there being a long-term problem. I still buy it because the long-term upside comes from inherent properties, specifically its supply policy, while the scariest downside has a plausible path to mitigation that's already starting to move forward.

Drop Protocol emerged as a significant innovation within the Cosmos ecosystem, creating an open-source liquid staking solution to facilitate better capital efficiency across decentralized finance (DeFi). Conventional systems restricted the usability of staked assets within the DeFi landscape, but Drop Protocol introduced ‘dAssets' such as dATOM or dTIA, which represented staked tokens and their accumulated rewards. These could be freely traded, used as collateral for loans, or added to liquidity pools. By promoting interoperability across chains, users enjoyed enhanced flexibility with their staked capital. The project, which gathered $4 million in seed funding, quickly established itself as a crucial piece of infrastructure for interchain staking.

The Droplets Program was set up to boost early adoption of Drop Protocol. It offered rewards for on-chain activities such as staking specific assets like ATOM or TIA and participating in various DeFi strategies. Rewards were calculated based on the amount and duration of assets staked, encouraging continuous engagement over passive participation. This program intended to distribute 100 million $DROP tokens, with a significant portion earmarked for participants.

In an unexpected turn of events, the Drop Protocol team ceased the protocol operations and concluded the $DROP token campaign in November 2025. Instead of distributing $DROP tokens as initially intended, they announced the distribution of 42,000 ATOM to users who earned Droplets during the active phases of the program. This shift aimed to compensate the early users fairly and was received as a practical solution to the closure of the Droplets Program.

Eligibility for the ATOM airdrop is straightforward—participants must have held at least one Droplet with their activities recorded in a snapshot on November 13, 2025. Eligible users can claim their ATOM tokens through the Drop Protocol interface. Steps include accessing the Droplets portal, connecting a compatible Cosmos wallet, and verifying the allocation before confirming the transaction. The ATOM tokens will then be directly transferred to the user's wallet.

Drop Protocol significantly influenced the DeFi space by enhancing liquidity and the utilization of staked assets within the broader Cosmos ecosystem. Its legacy lies in the innovative approach to unlocking capital efficiency and promoting greater ecosystem interoperability. Although the planned $DROP airdrop never materialized, the alternative compensation through an ATOM distribution ensures that the early supporters and active users of the protocol receive due recognition and rewards. This conclusion, while not as initially planned, affirms the value of their contributions to the protocol's brief but impactful operation.

Oops, something went wrong

Circle Internet Group has unveiled an aggressive 2026 roadmap centered on Arc, its Layer-1 blockchain designed to serve as an “Economic Operating System” for global finance.

The company aims to push Arc from testnet toward production while scaling its Circle Payments Network and StableFX applications to capture enterprise market share in stablecoin-powered settlement.

The strategy comes as Circle faces mounting competition from Tether, which generated $5.2 billion in revenue during 2025 and now controls 60.1% of the $311 billion stablecoin market through USDT.

Circle's USDC holds 24.2% market share at $72.4 billion circulation, trailing significantly despite 108% year-over-year growth.

Arc's public testnet has processed more than 150 million transactions since launching in October 2025, with close to 1.5 million transacting wallets and average settlement times around 0.5 seconds, according to Circle's latest product update.

The network attracted over 100 institutional participants, including BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, Société Générale, and Visa during its first 90 days.

Circle Chief Product & Technology Officer Nikhil Chandhok said the company is working toward production readiness by “evolving the validator set toward greater distribution” and “standing up a governance model that aligns with institutional risk and compliance expectations.“

The blockchain uses USDC as its native gas token and provides deterministic sub-second finality specifically designed for regulated financial operations.

The company has integrated Arc with its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol, which now connects 19 blockchains and has processed $126 billion in cumulative volume as of December 2025.

Circle introduced Gateway, a chain-agnostic system that unifies USDC balances across networks, and launched Build, a suite of AI developer tools alongside App Kits, to accelerate application development.

Circle's enterprise offensive unfolds as Tether expands beyond stablecoins into traditional finance, recently accumulating 140 tons of gold worth $23 billion and launching USAT, a federally regulated stablecoin under America's new GENIUS Act framework.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino told Bloomberg that the company is “soon becoming basically one of the biggest, let's say, gold central banks in the world,” while buying more than a ton per week.

Tether emerged as the most profitable crypto entity in 2025, capturing 41.9% of all stablecoin-related revenue and maintaining its position as the third-largest digital asset globally at $186.8 billion market value.

The company holds more U.S. Treasuries than Germany, South Korea, or Australia, cementing its role as a macroeconomic participant.

Meanwhile, Circle's Circle Payments Network has enrolled 29 financial institutions since launching in May 2025, with 55 undergoing eligibility reviews and 500 in the pipeline.

The network operates across eight countries and reached $3.4 billion in annualized transaction volumes, partnering with Binance, Corpay, FIS, Fiserv, and OKX.

BlackRock is staffing up for its next crypto expansion phase, posting digital asset roles across New York, London, and Singapore with managing director positions offering up to $350,000 annually.

The asset manager accepted its tokenized BUIDL fund as collateral at Binance and identified Bitcoin exposure as a core portfolio building block for 2025.

Visa also announced in December 2025 that it will allow U.S. financial institutions to settle transactions using USDC on Solana, offering “seven-day availability and improved resilience during weekends and holidays.“

Initial participants, Cross River Bank and Lead Bank, are already settling with Visa in USDC, with a broader U.S. rollout planned through 2026.

“Financial institutions are preparing to use stablecoins as part of their treasury operations,” said Rubail Birwadker, Visa's Global Head of Growth Products and Strategic Partnerships.

The payments giant is serving as a design partner for Arc and plans to operate a validator node once the blockchain launches.

Circle's partnership strategy extends to Asia, where the company signed a memorandum of understanding with LianLian Global in December 2025 to explore stablecoin-backed payment infrastructure for international merchants.

The collaboration will assess how USDC can “support faster and more resilient transactions especially in high-volume international payment flows,” according to the announcement.

The company's tokenized money market fund, USYC, expanded more than 200% since June 2025 to approximately $1.6 billion in assets as of January 2026, while StableFX launched on Arc testnet to enable 24/7 institutional stablecoin foreign exchange trading.

Circle reported $214 million net income for Q3 2025 as USDC circulation surged to $73.7 billion.

Chandhok emphasized that Arc and the broader platform aim to make “value moves with the same openness, reliability, determinism, and speed as information,” positioning Circle to compete as stablecoins become “the connective tissue of the global digital economy.“

Bitcoin slides to key support as overleveraged longs are wiped out, Middle East tensions rise, tech stocks wobble, and gold and silver hit fresh highs.

Microsoft's earnings report, which showed rising costs and slower growth in cloud services, are weighing on investor sentiment as the broader sell-off in the tech sector continues. 

Several major technology stocks declined following the results, leading some investors to reduce exposure to both equities and cryptocurrencies, traders said.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell sharply during early U.S. trading this week, triggering widespread liquidations across cryptocurrency exchanges, according to data from crypto.news.

Approximately 270,000 accounts were liquidated across exchanges in the past 24 hours, with total liquidations reaching significant levels, the data showed. More than 90% of the liquidated contracts were long positions, primarily in Bitcoin and Ether, according to reports.

The rapid price decline forced margin calls and triggered stop orders across trading platforms. Price gaps appeared on some exchanges as volatility increased, according to market observers.

Heightened tensions in the Middle East contributed to the selloff, analysts said. A U.S. warship deployment and public statements from U.S. President Donald Trump increased pressure on risk assets. An executive action related to tariffs on goods tied to certain oil transactions raised additional concerns among global traders, according to market participants.

Bitcoin was trading near a higher-timeframe support level that has been significant in recent months, according to technical analysts. Weekly price closes have remained within a recent range for several weeks.

The broader cryptocurrency market lost significant value across multiple tokens during the decline, according to market data.

Analyst Benjamin Cowen stated that Bitcoin may continue to underperform relative to stocks, suggesting that a rapid shift from gold or silver into cryptocurrency may not occur quickly. Gold and silver have climbed to record levels, according to Trading Economics.

Some analysts characterized the market reaction as excessive, noting that prices had been declining since October. Others warned that a prolonged correction could continue if macroeconomic pressures persist.

The collaboration aims to provide financial institutions with a streamlined path to adopting digital asset custody and payment capabilities without disrupting their mission-critical legacy systems.

The integration is significant due to the sheer scale of DXC's existing infrastructure. The Hogan core banking platform currently supports over 300 million deposit accounts and manages more than $5trillion in global deposits. By embedding Ripple's technology into this environment, the partnership offers a bridge between traditional finance and the “onchain” economy for a vast network of existing banking clients.

The solution is designed to enable programmable payments, as well as the tokenisation, custody, and transfer of digital assets. Crucially for risk-averse institutions, it allows for the deployment of these regulated use cases without necessitating a complete overhaul of core banking systems.

Sandeep Bhanote, global head and general manager of financial services at DXC, emphasized the necessity of this infrastructure for mass adoption: “For digital assets to move into the financial mainstream, institutions need secure custody and seamless payment capabilities. Our work with Ripple brings those capabilities together in a way that allows banks to engage in the digital asset ecosystem without changing their core systems, connecting traditional accounts, wallets and decentralized platforms at enterprise scale.”

The partnership addresses a common pain point for banks: the pressure to modernise and compete with fintechs while maintaining complex, decades-old infrastructure.

Joanie Xie, vice president and managing director, North America at Ripple, noted that the collaboration brings specific assets—including digital asset custody and RLUSD (Ripple's stablecoin)—directly into trusted environments.

“Banks are under increasing pressure to modernize while continuing to operate on complex infrastructure,” said Xie. “Together, we're enabling banks to deliver secure, compliant digital asset use cases at enterprise scale without disruption.”

The initiative will utilize Ripple Payments for managing fund flows and Ripple Custody for the secure management of digital assets, stablecoins, and Real World Assets (RWAs).

As talk of a “BRICS currency” grows, the bloc actually seems to be moving in a very different direction. Instead of one shared currency, BRICS is working on a digital payment system that links national digital currencies like India's e-rupee, China's e-yuan and Russia's e-ruble. WION Explains

As India prepares to host the BRICS summit later this year, amid rumours of a “BRICS currency” to replace the US dollar, the focus is expected to be on a shared payment system that links national digital currencies. Here's all you need to know about a BRICS payment system.

Previously, reports suggested the possible launch of a single BRICS currency that could potentially replace the US dollar. However, the proposals for a common currency ran into obvious problems: different inflation regimes, capital controls, and fears that China's yuan would dominate any shared system. However, this new approach, a BRICS payment system built on interoperable central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), could avoid all of that.

According to Asia Times, the idea is to connect existing central bank digital currencies, such as India's digital rupee, China's digital yuan and Russia's digital ruble, through a common payment infrastructure. Each country keeps full control over its own currency. What changes is how these currencies interact.

In simple terms, it would allow countries to settle trade directly in their own digital currencies, without routing payments through correspondent banks or the dollar-based SWIFT network.

India is playing a central role in shaping this direction. Summit host New Delhi has consistently pushed for interoperability rather than monetary integration, a philosophy shaped by its own digital payments success at home through Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The emphasis is on building systems that talk to each other while preserving sovereignty.

The Reserve Bank of India has been clear that the digital rupee is not a crypto asset and not a step toward a currency union. It is simply a digital version of sovereign money.

There is also a practical lesson behind this stance. Earlier trade settlements with Russia left Moscow holding large amounts of rupees it could not easily spend, the so-called “rupee trap”. A multilateral system, rather than bilateral deals, helps prevent currencies from piling up uselessly.

The proposed BRICS payment system rests on two technical ideas: settlement cycles and forex swap lines. Settlement cycles mean countries do not settle every transaction instantly. Instead, trade flows are netted out over a period. Only the final difference is transferred.

For example, if China imports 500 billion rupees worth of goods from India in a month and exports 450 billion, only the net 50 billion needs to be settled. That massively reduces liquidity needs and transaction costs.

Forex swap lines, meanwhile, act as a safety valve. If one country suddenly needs more of another's currency to settle its balance, central banks can temporarily swap currencies to smooth things over.

This is not about killing the dollar

None of this replaces the dollar. The dollar still dominates global finance, making up around 59 per cent of global reserves and about 58 per cent of international payments. But there is growing anxiety about how fragile that system has become.

US national debt is nearing 39 trillion dollars. Global debt stands at around $315 trillion, 64 per cent of which is denominated in dollars. That means the entire world is exposed to US monetary policy and US political stability.

The risk is circular. If global demand for dollar assets weakens, US borrowing costs rise. That tightens financial conditions everywhere and can trigger cascading crises.

This is where geopolitics enters. The concerns about the dollar partly stem from Russia's exclusion from SWIFT and the freezing of 300 billion dollars. While Iran, North Korea and Cuba have also faced similar measures before, Russia proved that even major economies are not immune.

With financial infrastructure emerging as a strategic weapon, the BRICS digital payment system could act as a shock absorber. A parallel system that keeps trade functioning if the main one breaks down.

The BRICS payment system will take some time to come into practice as most CBDCs are still in pilot stages. Legal frameworks and technical standards also vary wildly among the BRICS countries.

The likely path is gradual - starting with bilateral links, then stitching them into a network. India, meanwhile, already offers a model. Its UPI is already interoperable with the UAE's payment system, enabling fast cross-border transfers. Brazil's PIX and China's digital infrastructure could follow. Over time, this could evolve into a shared BRICS payment layer.

Leading cryptocurrencies plunged alongside stocks on Thursday, as a tech-driven sell-off sent risk-on markets into a tailspin.

Bitcoin sank below $84,000 to hit levels last seen in April. Trading volume surged 64% over the last 24 hours, signaling high selling pressure. 

Ethereum dived to $2,751, its worst since early July, while XRP and Dogecoin recorded sharp drops.

Shares of cryptocurrency-related companies, including Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR)  and Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BMNR), closed down 9.63% and 9.89%, respectively

About  $1.74 billion was liquidated from the market in the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass, with $1.64 billion in levered longs alone wiped out. Bitcoin's open interest fell 2.24% in the last 24 hours to $58.34 billion.

The market sentiment worsened from "Fear" to "Extreme Fear," according to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index.

Top Gainers (24 Hours) 

The global cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at $2.87 trillion, shrinking by 4.88% over the past 24 hours.

Major indexes closed in the red on Thursday. The S&P 500  slid 0.13% to end at 6,969.01, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite fell 0.72% to finish the session at 23,685.12

The Dow Jones Industrial Average defied the decline, gaining 0.11%, or 55.96 points, to close at 49,071.56.

Spot gold fell 0.85% to $5,329.63 per ounce, after reaching new highs of $5,590 earlier in the session.

In a note shared with Benzinga, analysts at cryptocurrency payment company B2BINPAY noted Ethereum's two month-long consolidation phase.

"This prolonged accumulation suggests that the $2,600-3,400 range reflects equilibrium and a fair value for the asset," the analysts said. "In other words, demand and supply are currently balanced."

They added that for the "picture to become clearer," the market needs a "clear impulse" either to the upside or downside.

Ali Martinez, a well-known cryptocurrency trader and analyst, derived $98,643, $121,482 and $144,321 as key resistance levels for Bitcoin from the Market Value to Realized Value pricing bands.

These pricing bands use statistical deviation from the Market Value to Realized Value ratio's all-time average to identify potential market tops and bottoms.

Bitcoin order-book analysis said that BTC price action was being held back by just one trading entity, while risking a trip to "Bearadise."

Bitcoin (BTC) lingered beneath $88,000 into Thursday's Wall Street open as attention switched to order-book manipulation.

Key points:

Bitcoin is facing fresh attempts to manipulate short-term price action, says analysis.

Order-book data flags key support and the risk of a trip to “Bearadise” if it fails to hold.

Wyckoff BTC price bottom calls grow more confident as the monthly close nears.

Data from TradingView showed ongoing BTC price weakness, with BTC/USD acting in an increasingly narrow range.

After failing to sustain above $90,000 the previous day, frustration continued to build among traders as stocks and precious metals smashed records.

In his latest analysis of exchange order-book liquidity, Keith Alan, cofounder of trading resource Material Indicators, had a theory as to why Bitcoin could no longer beat resistance.

“FireCharts shows $BTC price is being suppressed by one entity using a liquidity herding strategy to push price lower, potentially to get their own bids filled, or possible to keep price pinned in the lower end of this range before Friday's options expiry,” he told X followers on the day.

Alan referred to one of Material Indicators' proprietary trading tools covering liquidations at key nearby price levels, as well as whale order volume.

As Cointelegraph reported, large-volume entities are known to influence price action using liquidity to shift the market, trapping less experienced traders in the process.

“A significant amount of bid liquidity is concentrating in the $85k - $87.5k range to strengthen support, and potentially provide a foundation for a bounce before the Monthly Close,” Alan continued.

He warned that closing January below the 2026 open level at $87,500 would “serve as the gateway to Bearadise.”

Continuing, pseudonymous trader CW described $86,000 as a “buying wall” provided by whales.

“The gap between the buy and sell walls is narrowing. Volatility is coming,” an earlier X post forecast.

Earlier, Wyckoff analysis led commentator MartyParty to predict that Bitcoin would put in a long-term low around the end of the month.

This could see BTC/USD dip below $80,000 — an event that would act as the Wyckoff “spring” event before a dramatic market turnaround.

MartyParty uploaded two charts showing how the event could play out in the coming days.

Altcoins are feeling the impact of Bitcoin's latest sell-off, with total altcoin market capitalization continuing its downward trend.

Bitcoin's slide below $85,000 has triggered broad weakness across major altcoins, with market data showing losses extending beyond BTC into the broader market. 

While short-term price action has stabilized in pockets, aggregate figures suggest risk appetite has cooled rather than rotated.

Among the top ten crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins, losses were widespread over the past 24 hours.

Ethereum traded around $2,818, down 6.38% on the day, while BNB slipped 4.06% to roughly $865. XRP fell 5.79% to $1.80, extending its weekly decline to more than 6%.

Solana posted one of the sharpest pullbacks among large caps, down 6.26% on the day and over 8.5% across seven days.

Memecoins and high-beta assets also struggled. Dogecoin dropped 6.69% in 24 hours, while Cardano fell 7.17%, underscoring the lack of defensive positioning within the altcoin complex.

Volume data suggests the moves were not isolated. Ethereum recorded more than $36 billion in 24-hour trading volume. At the same time, Solana exceeded $6 billion, indicating that selling pressure was broadly distributed rather than confined to thin liquidity conditions.

Total altcoin market capitalization declined to around $1.18 trillion, continuing a downtrend that has been in place since early December.

While short-lived rebounds appeared earlier in the month, the broader trajectory shows lower highs and lower lows, pointing to sustained capital outflows rather than temporary volatility. 

The contraction coincides with Bitcoin's failure to reclaim higher resistance levels, reinforcing the market's current risk-off posture.

Notably, the data does not show meaningful divergence between large-cap and mid-cap altcoins. The decline appears systemic, with most sectors moving in tandem rather than investors reallocating into select narratives.

Despite Bitcoin's pullback, there is limited evidence of a classic rotation into altcoins. The absence of relative strength among major tokens suggests traders are reducing exposure rather than shifting risk within the crypto market.

This dynamic aligns with recent derivatives and liquidation data, which showed elevated leverage being unwound earlier in the week. As leverage resets, spot markets have followed with subdued demand and weaker follow-through on rebounds.

Unless Bitcoin regains traction above recent breakdown levels, altcoins are likely to remain sensitive to further downside or extended consolidation.

Researchers using a synchrotron at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have been able to recover pieces of the Hipparchus star catalog that had been overwritten.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Hipparchus was light-years ahead of his time. Around 2,150 years ago, the father of astronomy had not only figured out how equinoxes occur, invented a scale of stellar magnitude, observed planets, discovered a nova, and made cosmic predictions that were eerily accurate—he also created what is thought to be the first star catalog to ever exist. Then it was lost.

What remained of the catalog was hidden symbolism that first surfaced on a statue of Atlas shouldering the world. Known as the Farnese Atlas, this Roman copy of a Greek original eternally carries Earth as his burden at the Archaeological Museum in Naples, Italy. On the marble planet are glyphs and lines that may have been copied from one of several sky globes Hipparchus made in his time. It wouldn't be until 2022 that anything else from the early astronomer's star catalog would surface, this time as erasures on an ancient manuscript.

A palimpsest manuscript is one that has been erased and written over multiple times. Because parchment made from animal skins was expensive, it was often reused, with old scripts erased and eclipsed by new ones. But part of Hipparchus' catalog that would have been invisible on one of these palimpsests was revealed using multispectral imaging. Now, several years later, more star coordinates in the fabled catalog have been discovered in another palimpsest manuscript, the Codex Climaci Rescriptus. First created by Christian monks in Egypt during the 5th or 6th century C.E., some of the Codex's pages were written over as many as six times in the following 200 years.

Led by archaeologist and translator Victor Gysembergh of Sorbonne University in Paris, France, a team of researchers at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory used X-rays generated by the facility's synchrotron to see past layers of ink that had been scratched off or otherwise erased, allowing them to decipher the original writing that indicated star coordinates from the Hipparchus catalog. The Codex Climaci Rescriptus is pieced together from at least ten different Greek and Aramaic manuscripts. Text from those manuscripts was erased and overwritten by monks with a Syriac translation of the religious works of Saint John Climacus of Sinai. 

“The goal is to recover as many of these coordinates as possible,” Gysembergh, who also led the 2022 deciphering efforts, recently told KQED. “And this will help us answer some of the biggest questions on the birth of science […] because the coordinates we are finding are incredibly accurate for something that is done with the naked eye.”

For the pages to stay intact as they made their way to SLAC from the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., they traveled in cases that were controlled for humidity, and could only be carried by hand, because the parchment is so ancient and fragile. Despite that fragility, using a synchrotron made it possible to decode traces of star coordinates on the palimpsest. A synchrotron is a type of particle accelerator that uses electric and magnetic fields to excite electrons until they are moving at the speed of light and leaving behind intense X-ray beams. Preventing damage meant radiation needed to be kept at low levels, with X-ray pulses lasting only about ten milliseconds, and keeping targeted areas of the parchment no wider than a human hair.  

Seeing past so many layers is possible because different types of ink with distinct chemical compositions were used on the parchment. By adjusting the X-ray beam to detect specific elements, the researchers were able to identify traces of writing no longer visible to the naked eye. Because the ink used to transcribe Hipparchus' star map was high in calcium, the synchrotron could see it.  Though this process may be slow, it has had incredible results. When the team used the synchrotron to scan 11 pages of the manuscript late in the day, lines of ancient Greek that had barely appeared as smudges before were showing up on the monitor. 

What has surfaced from Hipparchus' star catalog can now be used to infer how ancient astronomers without telescopes were able to map the cosmos so precisely. It's just a matter of reading between the lines.

Bluesky released its first transparency report this week documenting the actions taken by its Trust & Safety team and the results of other initiatives, like age-assurance compliance, monitoring of influence operations, automated labeling, and more.

The social media startup — a rival to X and Threads — grew nearly 60% in 2025, from 25.9 million users to 41.2 million, which includes accounts hosted both on Bluesky's own infrastructure and those running their own infrastructure as part of the decentralized social network based on Bluesky's AT Protocol.

During the past year, users made 1.41 billion posts on the platform, which represented 61% of all posts ever made on Bluesky. Of those, 235 million posts contained media, accounting for 62% of all media posts shared on Bluesky to date.

The company also reported a fivefold increase in legal requests from law enforcement agencies, government regulators, and legal representatives in 2025, with 1,470 requests, up from 238 requests in 2024.

While the company previously shared moderation reports in 2023 and 2024, this is the first time it's put together a comprehensive transparency report. The new report tackles other areas outside of moderation, like regulatory compliance and account verification information, among other things.

Compared with 2024, when Bluesky saw a 17x increase in moderation reports, the company this year reported a 54% increase, going from 6.48 million user reports in 2024 to 9.97 million in 2025.

Though the number jumped, Bluesky noted that the growth “closely tracked” its 57% user growth that occurred over the same period.

Around 3% of the user base, or 1.24 million users, submitted reports in 2025, with the top categories being “misleading” (which includes spam) at 43.73% of the total, “harassment” at 19.93%, and sexual content at 13.54%. 

A catch-all “other” category included 22.14% of the reports that didn't fall under these categories, or others like violence, child safety, breaking site rules, or self-harm, which accounted for much smaller percentages.

Within the “misleading” category's 4.36 million reports, spam accounted for 2.49 million reports.

Meanwhile, hate speech accounted for the largest share of the 1.99 million “harassment” reports, with about 55,400 reports. Other areas that saw activity included targeted harassment (about 42,520 reports), trolling (29,500 reports), and doxxing (about 3,170 reports).

However, Bluesky said that the majority of “harassment” reports included those that fell into the gray area of antisocial behavior, which may include rude remarks, but didn't fit into the other categories, like hate speech.

Most of the sexual content reports (1.52 million) concerned mislabeling, Bluesky says, meaning that adult content was not properly marked with metadata — tags that allow users to control their own moderation experience using Bluesky's tools. 

A smaller number of reports focused on nonconsensual intimate imagery (about 7,520), abuse content (about 6,120), and deepfakes (over 2,000).

Reports focused on violence (24,670 in total) were broken down into subcategories like threats or incitement (about 10,170 reports), glorification of violence (6,630 reports), and extremist content (3,230 reports).

In addition to user reports, Bluesky's automated system flagged 2.54 million potential violations. 

One area where Bluesky reported success involved a decline in daily reports of antisocial behavior on the site, which dropped 79% after the implementation of a system that identified toxic replies and reduced their visibility by putting them behind an extra click, similar to what X does.

Bluesky also saw a drop in user reports month-over-month, with reports per 1,000 monthly active users declining 50.9% from January to December.

Outside of moderation, Bluesky noted it removed 3,619 accounts for suspected influence operations, most likely those operating from Russia. 

The company said last fall it was getting more aggressive about its moderation and enforcement, and that appears to be true.

Last year, Bluesky took down 2.44 million items in 2025, including accounts and content. The year prior, Bluesky had taken down 66,308 accounts, and its automated tooling took down 35,842 accounts. 

Moderators also took down 6,334 records, and automated systems removed 282.

Bluesky also issued 3,192 temporary suspensions in 2025, and 14,659 permanent removals for ban evasion. Most of the permanent suspensions were focused on accounts engaging in inauthentic behavior, spam networks, and impersonation.

However, its report suggests that it prefers labeling content more than it does booting out users. Last year, Bluesky applied 16.49 million labels to content, up 200% year-over-year, while account takedown grew 104% from 1.02 million to 2.08 million. Most of the labeling involved adult and suggestive content or nudity.

Billionaire tech mogul Reid Hoffman is urging his fellow tech moguls in Silicon Valley to not just condemn the killings of two American citizens at the hands of Border Patrol agents, but to stop pacifying President Trump.

In posts on X and an opinion column penned for The San Francisco Standard, Hoffman writes: “We in Silicon Valley can't bend the knee to Trump. We can't shrink away and hope the crisis fades. Hope without action is not a strategy ––  it's an invitation for Trump to trample whatever he can see, including our own business and security interests.”

There's been some pushback among the most powerful in the Valley against these deaths. Besides Hoffman, a longtime critic of Trump, billionaire VC Vinod Khosla has been the most vocal, characterizing the White House and crew as “a conscious-less administration.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have also expressed concern over the Border Patrol incidents, with some doing so in leaked internal memos. But most of them were quick to distance their concerns over this issue from the president himself.

That's the distinction that Hoffman wants to end. He's making the case that tech leaders have power “and sitting on that power is not good for business. It's also not neutrality. It's a choice.”

Still, many of the largest tech companies depend on the federal government for business, including AI regulation, tariffs that affect the costs of their products, and massive, lucrative contracts to supply the U.S. government with technology. (OpenAI even got in a bit of hot water in November after its CFO said, and later walked back, that the company wanted the feds to backstop their loans, essentially guaranteeing payment so the AI lab could get more favorable rates.)

Hoffman is echoing the sentiment of a growing contingent of tech workers, who have signed a petition asking their CEOs to call the White House and demand that ICE leave U.S. cities, to cancel all company contracts with ICE, and to speak out publicly against ICE's violence.

While there certainly are tech leaders who remain vocal supporters of Trump, like Elon Musk and Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures, many leaders appear to be, at least publicly, walking the fence. Cook, for instance, wrote that he was “heartbroken” and urged “de-escalation” in his internal memo, but also attended an exclusive screening of First Lady Melania Trump's documentary hours after the ICE shooting of Alex Pretti, one of the Americans killed in the incidents. Hence Hoffman's call to arms.

Seattle startup Electric Era landed $5.05 million in National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program funding to install six charging stations along interstates and highways in Washington state. The company builds DC fast-charging systems that include giant batteries to help deliver and store power.

Editor's note: Story updated to correct the amount of funding awarded to Electric Era. The original post was inaccurate due to an error on the state's website.

— After more than 20 years at the tech giant, Steve Rabuchin has retired from Amazon, leaving the role of vice president of Project Kuiper, the internet-providing satellite project that was recently rebranded as Amazon Leo. 

Rabuchin's career at the company included serving as general manager for Kindle, vice president of Amazon Appstore, VP of Alexa, and a stint with AWS, among other roles.

Amazon this week laid off 16,000 workers from corporate roles, but Rabuchin made clear in a LinkedIn post that his departure was voluntary. 

“So, what's next? I am going to spend a significant amount of my time working on my fitness, health and longevity — which will definitely include golf + pickleball + family time! I also have plans for a new venture but will save those details for later,” Rabuchin wrote. 

— Jon Turow left his role as a partner at Seattle investment firm Madrona to join the technical staff at Anthropic as a “builder.”

“After four years as a VC investor at Madrona, I've decided to jump back onto the field,” Turow said on LinkedIn. “I'm incredibly grateful to the founders I was honored to support and to the Madrona team — I learned so much from both.”

Prior to Madrona, Turow was at Amazon Web Services for nearly a decade, serving as head of product for computer vision and as a technical lead for Greengrass, which extends AWS functionality to local devices. Turow will remain a venture partner at Madrona. 

— Hrvoje Benko, former director of research science at Meta Reality Labs Research, was among those recently let go in a round of layoffs affecting 331 employees in Washington state. Benko was with the company for eight years and remains an affiliate professor at the University of Washington.

“I am leaving full of pride and gratitude for I was fortunate to have a chance to build and lead an amazing AI and HCI research effort from scratch, see it grow and accomplish so much, build many generations of innovative XR and AI wearables, change the company roadmap on multiple occasions, and learn a ton from many amazing colleagues in the process,” he said on LinkedIn.  

Prior to Meta, Benko was with Microsoft for more than a decade, working as a principal researcher.

— Global fintech company Convera named Meaghan Riley as chief commercial officer. Riley joined the Seattle-based business from Google Cloud North America where she was chief operating officer. Past positions include senior leadership roles at DocuSign, SAP and others. 

“Meaghan's leadership will be instrumental in delivering on our commitment to make global business payments simpler and smarter — serving our customers with excellence while building a high performing, aligned organization,” Convera CEO Patrick Gauthier said in a statement. 

— Greater Seattle Partners, a public-private economic development organization, named two new members to its team:

— BJ Fox is now chief technology officer for Metrc, a Florida company with technology to track and trace cannabis products from “seed to sale.” Fox has been based in the Seattle area most of his career, working in C-suite and other leadership roles at companies including Swiftly, SimpleID, Thunder, Glympse, GetJar and others.

— Seattle investment firm Flying Fish Ventures appointed Malyun Abdullahi as chief of staff. Abdullahi previously worked at Columbia Hospitality and graduated in 2024 from the University of Washington with a degree in business administration.

— Bonnie Frye Hemphill has joined the board of CleanTech Alliance, a Washington trade group. Hemphill is also director of policy and partnerships at UMC, a company helping clients plan, build, and manage their buildings, facilities or construction projects.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

Amazon built its in-person grocery brand on the promise that shoppers could “just walk out.” On Thursday in Seattle's Central District, they couldn't even walk right in. 

A line of more than 30 people stretched from the door of the Amazon Fresh store at 23rd and Jackson for much of the afternoon, ebbing and flowing as employees let shoppers in 15 at a time. Many waited more than 30 minutes. It was an unexpected farewell for a retail experiment built on the promise of streamlining grocery shopping.

Amazon announced this week that it's closing all of its Fresh grocery and Go convenience stores, many of them on Sunday. The news sent bargain hunters rushing to stores across the country after word of 50% clearance discounts spread on TikTok and Instagram.

In announcing the closures, Amazon said it wasn't able to create “a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion.”

Many of those in line were less interested in Amazon's business justifications than in the impact of the closure on the neighborhood and their lives.

The closures are part of a broader reset at Amazon, which is also laying off an additional 16,000 corporate employees this week as CEO Andy Jassy works to streamline operations. Some people in line questioned the timing of it all, noting that Amazon had remodeled and opened new stores in recent years.

They're “throwing money away,” one shopper said. “I don't understand it.”

Stacey Beaver, who grew up down the street, remembers when a Red Apple grocery stood on the same site. It was demolished to make way for the mixed-use Jackson Apartments development, where Amazon Fresh opened in 2021. The closure leaves residents with a 10-minute bus ride or a 30-minute walk from the nearest major grocery store in either direction.

Many people in the neighborhood don't drive and depended on having a grocery store within walking distance. A bus ride or a long walk to the nearest alternative is a real barrier. 

“Now you have nothing,” Beaver said.

Marco Vertucci, who lives a few blocks away, was a regular. He liked being able to drop off Amazon returns and get store credit, and he appreciated the Dash Cart — the high-tech shopping cart that scans items and tracks your total as you shop.

“Sometimes you have a whole cart and you're like, ‘Oh, shit, I didn't mean to spend $200,'” he said. “This way you can actually track what you get.”

He found out about the closure Tuesday from a friend who texted him an article. “I'm not a huge fan of Amazon,” he said. “But just the convenience of it.”

Some described a store that never quite caught on. Foot traffic was sparse, shoplifting was common, and several regulars said they weren't surprised by the closure. 

Others had never set foot in an Amazon Fresh before Thursday. They'd seen the sale trending on TikTok and came for the deals. For them, a physical store never made much sense. 

Amazon Prime, one first-time store shopper said, is for delivery.

Amazon is betting on that. The company is shifting focus in part to same-day Amazon Fresh delivery, which is now available in 2,300 U.S. cities and towns. Amazon says perishable grocery sales through the service have grown 40-fold since January 2025, with fresh items now making up nine of the top 10 most-ordered products in areas where it's available.

It also plans to open more than 100 new Whole Foods stores over the next several years, expanding the chain it acquired for $13.7 billion in 2017. Some Fresh stores will be converted into Whole Foods. Amazon hasn't said whether 23rd and Jackson will be one.

Some of the technology Amazon developed for its Fresh and Go stores will live on. For example, a redesigned version of the Dash Cart is rolling out to Whole Foods locations. 

The “Just Walk Out” system — which uses overhead cameras and sensors to let customers skip checkout — was phased out of Fresh stores in 2024 in favor of Dash Carts, but remained a core technology in Amazon Go convenience stores until the end. 

It now operates in more than 360 third-party locations, including hospitals and sports arenas.

Amazon is discontinuing its Amazon One palm recognition system, which let customers enter stores and pay by scanning their hand. The company cited limited customer adoption. A terminal inside the 23rd and Jackson store displayed the message: “Amazon One palm authentication services will be discontinued at retail businesses on June 3, 2026.”

Once we made it inside the store on Thursday afternoon, we found shelves about half empty and aisles packed with shoppers filling their carts. Lines were as long as six people deep at checkout. 

A sign on the freezer case read, “Low prices, here to stay.” The shelves behind it were bare.

Elon Musk's rocket company is reportedly in talks to merge SpaceX with some of his other businesses, ahead of a planned initial public offering on Wall Street later this year.

Several media outlets, including Bloomberg and Reuters, reported that SpaceX is considering a potential merger with Musk's electric vehicle company, Tesla. Alternatively, it's also weighing a deal with xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence company that owns the chatbot Grok and the social media platform X.

There are already signs SpaceX is preparing for either scenario. Bloomberg reported that two legal entities established in Nevada include “merger sub” in their names and list SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen as an officer. 

SpaceX, xAI, and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

A merger between SpaceX and either company could make sense. Musk has previously stated that one of SpaceX's ambitions is to place data centers in space. Still, Bloomberg reports that investors appear particularly excited about the idea of a Tesla merger.

In contrast, a merger between the private company and xAI could come with its own more personal benefits. The deal could make xAI the first major AI startup to get a big, glitzy public debut. 

That timing here is key. The Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI is eyeing an IPO as early as the fourth quarter of this year. Anthropic, the company behind the Claude chatbot and coding agent, has also reportedly held talks with banks about going public, according to the newspaper. Neither company responded to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

For its part, SpaceX is reportedly targeting a mid-June public debut to coincide with a conjunction of Jupiter and Venus near Musk's birthday.

If xAI were folded into that IPO, it would give public-market investors their first direct chance to buy into a major AI startup, essentially giving Musk the first access to a bigger pool of investors. Additionally, if there really is an AI bubble going on, it wouldn't hurt to get investors on board before it bursts. 

There may also be a more personal motive behind a SpaceX–xAI merger. Musk has had a contentious relationship with OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, for years. Musk co-founded OpenAI but later left the company in 2018, reportedly due to disagreements over the direction of what was then a nonprofit organization.

Musk is now suing OpenAI and Microsoft for $134 billion, alleging “wrongful gains.” He claims he invested $38 million in OpenAI's seed funding and made significant nonmonetary contributions under the belief that the company would remain a nonprofit.

OpenAI strongly disputes those claims. Earlier this month, the company published a blog post responding to Musk's court filings, arguing that Musk had agreed that OpenAI would need to transition into a for-profit structure. According to OpenAI, Musk ultimately walked away after the company rejected his proposal to merge OpenAI into Tesla.

If Musk gets xAI to Wall Street first, he'd almost certainly frame it as a win over OpenAI.

Would you buy Sony's perfunctory PlayStation Portal if it finally had a screen that looked as good as a Steam Deck OLED? The Portal has proven its chops as a remote player and game streaming device as of late, enough that Sony could be using it as a testbed for what may eventually become a PlayStation 6 handheld. 

Sony's remote player is literally a DualSense controller split in half with a screen in the middle, which means any upgrade to its display is a pretty big deal. The relatively reliable leaker KeplerL2 posted on the Neogaf forums that there may be an OLED version of the Portal on its way this year. That's in addition to rumors spread by fellow leaker Zuby_Tech on X, which promised the screen could hit a max of 120Hz refresh rate, up from 60Hz on the current Portal.

This supposed “Portal Pro,” or whatever it's called, will be the first hardware update to the device since its launch in 2023. We still don't have a good idea what this would mean for the device's battery life. All in all, it may prove to be a mere aesthetic upgrade. However, with new updates coming to PlayStation consoles, we may have the chance to see more games hit the fabled 120 fps benchmark when running at that lower resolution.

The PlayStation Portal offers only an ounce of what players really want from a handheld, and yet it's reportedly sold relatively well, at least compared to its 2023 launch. Last week, Circana's leading video game industry analyst, Mat Piscatella, posted on Bluesky that the Portal has a 7% attachment rate for U.S. PS5 owners from launch to date. The PS5 has sold 84.1 million units worldwide as of September last year, according to Sony. 

While we don't have official numbers on U.S.-specific sales numbers, Circana's estimates suggest Sony has managed to sell several million units of a device that's good for remotely playing a PS5 over Wi-Fi and, more recently, for streaming some games with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. The Portal recently received an update that enhanced its UI and made it easier to access these streaming titles.

The supposed Switch 2-like dockable PlayStation 6 handheld has already been detailed in multiple leaks by reliable AMD rumormonger Moore's Law is Dead on YouTube. This upcoming device may use AMD's yet-to-be-released RDNA 5 graphics. That's a big deal, since it could get access to more graphics potential and better upscaling developed jointly by AMD and Sony. KeplerL2 clarified some additional details to Moore's Law's reporting, including that it would use LPDDR5X-9600 memory and run at a standard 15W of TDP (thermal design power). Based on the specs, it could prove to be a powerful handheld for playing current-gen and next-gen titles.

The PlayStation 5 still feels like it has life left in it. Sure, it's running on AMD's older RDNA 2 graphics microarchitecture. Some modern games (mostly Unreal Engine 5 titles) struggle to meet the low watermark of 60 fps performance. At the same time, Sony may soon offer a new round of upscaling updates, called PSSR 2 (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution), that could boost the performance of games on PlayStation 5 Pro. 

Industry analyst David Gibson at MST Financial reported the ongoing RAM shortage has likely delayed any release of a true PlayStation 6 console. Considering the spiking cost of current-generation consoles, maybe that's not such a bad thing. The real problem would be a delay for a next-generation Sony handheld, one that may finally prove the company's PlayStation Vita deserved a second shot. In the meantime, during this cold, cold winter, we may need to huddle for warmth with our PlayStation Portals and imagine what they could be.

Display makers and OSATs begin parallel investments as the race towards glass-core qualification continues. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Glass wafer materials are emerging as a potential and viable alternative to their more conventional, aged organic counterparts. Replacing plastic-based cores with glass panels, these substrates offer lower warpage and a flatter overall profile, two properties that chipmakers will be keen to take advantage of as packaging becomes more of a performance limiter alongside silicon and memory.

Samsung, AMD, Intel, Broadcom, and even AWS have all been associated with glass-substrate evaluation as they contend with the challenges posed by growing package sizes and wiring density. Now, according to Korean supply chain reporting cited by DigiTimes, several Chinese companies from across PCBs, displays, and outsourced semiconductor assembly are understood to be moving into the glass substrate market as the technology is increasingly seen as “a new growth engine.”

Visionix, an advanced display solutions provider that spun out of Tsinghua University in 2001, and BOE Technology, one of the world's largest manufacturers of OLED and flexible displays, were two of the most prominent companies named in the initial reporting, along with PCB supplier AKM Meadville and Yuntian Semiconductor.

According to industry sources, these companies are said to be involved in full-chain buildouts, with equipment and process capabilities assembled in parallel. Visionix alone is understood to have now begun “full-scale investment” after spending the second half of 2025 organizing a supply chain for materials and equipment. Meanwhile, BOE has already launched a glass substrate business following internal technical verification.

On the manufacturing side, AKM has built a pilot production line, while assembly and test giant Yuntian — which gained notoriety after entering Huawei's supply chain — is also known to be assembling its own glass substrate capability. According to the industry sources cited by DigiTimes, Chinese suppliers are keen to move into this space quickly by standing up manufacturing flows all at once to shorten time to market, rather than scaling incrementally.

It should come as no surprise that capital scale and execution speed are being emphasized here. Chinese officials have been unusually transparent about the importance it is placing on establishing a domestic semiconductor market that can stand up to and compete with the West in the age of AI. It's a matter of significant national importance to the Chinese, with Xi Jinping recently calling AI “epoch-making” and defining it as a core pillar of the country's next five-year plan through 2030.

China's approach here isn't without risk. Glass substrates introduce entirely new defect modes and reliability challenges, and early missteps can be very expensive because these defects tend to appear later in the manufacturing process. Glass is, of course, brittle, so microscopic cracks from mishandling or drilling can survive early inspection and then propagate during thermal cycling or mechanical stress. It's entirely possible — and arguably likely — that customers evaluating early glass-core packages will require extensive thermal cycling and long-term aging data before they can commit to volume production, potentially extending timelines beyond the 2027 to 2030 projections given by manufacturers currently working with the technology.

Chinese companies seem to be willing to absorb these challenges and the potential associated costs in exchange for a long-term competitive advantage in advanced packaging. And, at the same time, glass handling and high-throughput manufacturing are already core competencies of the likes of BOE and Visionix, who are uniquely positioned to redeploy their expertise into the semiconductor glass substrate market.

Outside China, companies in South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and the U.S. are also exploring glass substrates. SK group subsidiary Absolics is among the most advanced and is expected to become the first company to commercialize the technology after beginning prototype production at its Georgia, U.S. facility last year. Meanwhile, Samsung Electro-Mechanics signed a memorandum of understanding with Sumitomo Chemical back in November to establish a joint venture for glass cores, while LG Innotek has delayed its glass substrate commercialization until 2030 due to demand uncertainty.

Naturally, companies linked to TSMC and major substrate suppliers like Unimicron are also exploring glass substrate options as part of their broader advanced packaging roadmaps, while Japan's Dai Nippon Printing has been developing glass-core technology within its advanced packaging business. The company announced work on glass core substrates using high-density TGV aimed at next-gen semiconductor packages back in 2023, announcing the launch of a TGV glass core substrate pilot line at its Kuki Plant last December.

While all these companies are currently racing towards first qualification rather than full volume production, once a supplier manages to iron out defects and is qualified for flagship chip packaging, multi-year supply agreements will follow. It's easy to see why China wants in on that, but ultimately, the pace at which Chinese suppliers can close any technical gaps will be the deciding factor on whether its entry to the market can shake up competition. A mature glass display sector may shorten the learning curve, but semiconductor packaging imposes punishingly tighter reliability and defect requirements than display manufacturing.

Intel Foundry this week released a promotional document aimed at detailing its leading-edge front-end and back-end offerings for AI and HPC applications, and showcased its 'AI chip test vehicle' that demonstrates the company's current packaging capabilities. Indeed, they are quite impressive as the company is showing off an 8 reticle-sized system-in-package (SiP) that features four logic tiles, 12 HBM4-class stacks, and two I/O tiles. More importantly, unlike the massive concept with 16 logic tiles and 24 HBM5 stacks the company presented last month, this one is actually manufacturable today.

First and foremost, it is necessary to note that what Intel Foundry is showcasing is not a working AI accelerator, but rather an 'AI chip test vehicle' that shows how future AI and HPC processors can be physically built (or rather assembled). To a large degree, the company is demonstrating its entire construction method that combines large compute tiles, stacks of high-bandwidth memory, ultra-fast chip-to-chip links, and a new class of power delivery into one manufacturable package. This package differs significantly from what TSMC offers today (more on this later). In short, the concept shows that next-generation heavy-duty AI processors are multi-chiplet designs, and Intel Foundry can build them.

At the heart of this platform are four large logic tiles allegedly built on Intel 18A process technology (hence featuring RibbonFET gate-all-around transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery) that are flanked by HBM4-class memory stacks and I/O tiles and presumably stitched together with EMIB-T 2.5D bridges embedded directly in the package substrate. Intel uses EMIB-T, which adds through-silicon vias inside the bridges so that power and signals can pass vertically as well as laterally, to maximize interconnection density and power delivery. Logically, the platform is designed for UCIe die-to-die interfaces running at 32 GT/s and beyond, which are also seemingly used to attach presumably C-HBM4E stacks.

The test vehicle also previews Intel's move toward vertical integration. The company's roadmap includes Intel 18A-PT process technology developed specifically for chiplets that stack other logic dies or memory on top and therefore must feature backside power delivery, pass-through TSVs, and hybrid bonding. In the case of the 'AI chip test vehicle', 18A-PT base dies sit under 18A/18A-P compute dies and either act as large caches or perform some additional work. To connect chiplets vertically, Intel uses its Foveros family — Foveros 2.5D, Foveros-R, and Foveros Direct 3D — packaging technologies to enable fine-pitch copper-to-copper bonding between active dies. Together with EMIB bridges, these methods enable Intel to build a hybrid lateral-and-vertical assembly that Intel positions as an alternative to large silicon interposers with higher wafer utilization and yield.

 




For multi-chiplet AI and HPC accelerators, power delivery is the principal design constraint. To that end, Intel's platform should be able to combine all of Intel's latest power-related innovations, including PowerVia, on-die Omni MIM capacitors, bridge-level decoupling in EMIB-T, base-die eDTC and eMIM-T capacitors, and embedded CoaxMIL inductors to support 'semi' integrated voltage regulators (IVR) that are located beneath every stack and below the package itself (as opposed to IVRs in the case of TSMC's CoWoS-L, which are a part of the interposer). This layered network is designed to support fast current swings of generative AI workloads without collapsing voltage margins and deliver maximum clean power when needed.

Showing an 'AI chip test vehicle' is a way for Intel to attract customers. Yet, it remains to be seen whether the company's codenamed Jaguar Shores AI accelerator, due in 2027, will use the architecture that Intel is showcasing today.

"We'll look at a range of options to deal with that."

Tim Cook said that Apple has a low supply of memory chips following the increased demand for the latest iPhones. Cook said in his response to a question about the memory shortage's impact on the company during its 1Q26 earnings call that Apple does not keep these chips in stock, and that it's currently scrambling to find sources because of the iPhone's strong sales in December.

“We were thrilled with the customer response on the latest iPhone lineup. It exceeded our expectations, to say the least, and you know, iPhone grow 23%,” Cook said. “What the result of the was that we exited the December quarter with very lean channel inventory due to that staggering level of demand. And based off that, we're in a supply chase mode to meet the very high levels of customer demand.” He also added later, “We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly. As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that.”

Apple is known for the egregious pricing it puts on memory and storage upgrades on its devices. For example, the 13-inch MacBook Air with a 10-core GPU costs $1,199 for the basic 16GB Unified Memory and 256GB SSD storage configuration. But if you want to get an extra 16GB of RAM to bump its capacity to 32GB, you have to pay Apple an extra $400. By comparison, the pricing trend for 64GB (2x16GB) of DDR5-6000 RAM kits used sit under $150 before the memory apocalypse. While the best RAM kits with 32GB of capacity now exceed $400, you can still get a decent 16GB kit for less than $250 — this is by no means an affordable price, but it's still way less than what Apple charges you just to get the privilege of more memory.

Nevertheless, it is still one of the remaining few companies that have not increased pricing because of the memory chip shortage, possibly as a result of the prices being so high to begin with. Mini PC maker Minisforum was one of the first to announce a price hike, and it was soon followed by Dell, Asus, and even Framework desktops — because of this, industry experts predict PC prices to jump by 8% in 2026.

Apparently, complaints from the Windows Insider community have reached a tipping point for Microsoft higher-ups.

Complaints surrounding Windows 11's buggy updates and glitchy UI have apparently finally reached the ears of Microsoft, and the company wants to do something about it in 2026. The Verge reports that Microsoft is now focusing on fixing Windows 11's core issues for the rest of the year, in a process known as "swarming".

The Verge received a statement from Windows and devices president Pavan Davuluri, who claims that feedback from Windows Insiders to fix Windows 11's core issues has been loud and clear. Davuluri further claimed that Microsoft needs to improve Windows "in ways that are meaningful for people", and this year will see Microsoft improving performance, reliability, and the "overall experience" of Windows.

Windows 11 has faced backlash since its launch for having "bloated UI", inconsistent performance, and stricter system requirements than Windows 10. Windows 11 requires a TPM 2.0 module to exist on the host computer to officially work (without workarounds).

Lately, Windows 11 users have had to deal with severe problems affecting the OS's basic functionality, including boot failures after installing the latest (January 2026) security update. Last year, we also saw other security updates break Windows 10 and Windows 11's recovery tools, preventing users from saving their files when reinstalling Windows through some methods.

Performance has been another concern users have had; a Windows enthusiast benchmarked all editions of Windows, dating back to Windows XP, and found that Windows 11 could not win a single test he ran, thanks to the OS's larger footprint compared to Windows 10 and older versions.

Pavan Davuluri's comments don't reflect the first time we have heard Microsoft promise to improve Windows 11 performance. Microsoft promised to fix Windows 11 gaming performance specifically last December, and promised to accelerate BitLocker storage performance in the same month, too.

The first Trump administration, and the tech industry that stood up to it, are both looking quainter by the day.

Here's one example: In 2017, when President Trump issued a series of executive orders instituting a travel ban on foreigners from certain countries (predominantly Muslim-majority ones), people from across the United States vigorously protested the policy. They included some of tech's most elite: Google cofounder Sergey Brin, who joined a demonstration at the San Francisco airport; Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who wrote a company-wide email outlining “legal options” that Amazon was considering to fight the ban; and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who took to Instagram to describe his own family's immigrant roots.

How times have changed. On Saturday, hours after federal agents shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in the streets of Minneapolis, several prominent tech executives attended a private White House screening of Melania, a documentary being released by (of course) Amazon MGM Studios. The timing was not lost on the group of Silicon Valley workers who recently launched ICEout.tech, essentially an open letter to their bosses. The letter, posted following Renee Nicole Good's killing earlier this month, has now been signed by more than 1,000 tech employees. Those workers, who come from across the spectrum of Big Tech companies and startups, are asking that executives use their clout to demand Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents leave American cities, that they cancel company contracts with the agency, and that they speak publicly about ICE's violent and deadly tactics.

Worker-led demands like those were commonplace during Trump 1.0, when tech employees at the world's biggest companies often spoke out—internally and externally—about the cruelty of the US administration and the industry's role in facilitating or tempering its most craven policies. Today, though, a movement like ICEout.tech feels downright revolutionary: Tech employees have been notably quiet this past year, as the power dynamic within their companies tilted to favor management versus frontline workers. Meanwhile, the executives leading those companies have been busy kissing the ring—over dinner at the White House or with outlandishly expensive documentaries nobody's watching—at every opportunity.

Is the dam finally breaking? This week, Silicon Valley leaders including Anthropic heads Dario and Daniela Amodei, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Apple CEO Tim Cook finally spoke out about ICE's outrageous overreach. It's a start, but I wanted to know more about what was happening inside tech circles, and where the industry goes from here. So I asked two early ICEout.tech signatories, Moonshine AI CEO Pete Warden and Gatheround cofounder Lisa Conn, to sit down for an emergency episode of The Big Interview.

Here's our conversation.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KATIE DRUMMOND: Pete and Lisa, thank you so much for joining me. I'm thrilled that you're able to be here.

PETE WARDEN: It's great to be here.

LISA CONN: Thank you for having us.

You both work in the tech industry, and you have for a long time. You're among the many who've signed the ICEout.tech letter that has now been widely circulated in Silicon Valley.

That movement and the website actually launched earlier this month after the tragic shooting of Renee Nicole Good. What made you decide to put your name on this letter? At this moment in the tech industry, it is no small thing to put your name out there on a document like this.

Conn: I signed the letter for a bunch of reasons. I think one of the primary ones is that it feels like we are entering an economic and governance crisis when the government starts killing people on the streets and then denying or reframing what is clearly documented. It's really a bad situation.

Just purely thinking about the economics of it, in those circumstances, capital starts to flee. Talent leaves, and it will take decades to recover from a situation like this. Businesses are not going to thrive when employees fear for their safety and communities are being terrorized, and tech hubs and tech leaders and employees are especially vulnerable because our talent is so mobile.

People can and will leave, start companies elsewhere, choose to work elsewhere. This is not hypothetical, this is happening in front of us right now. So I suppose it is risky within the tech community and when thinking about potential retaliation from the Trump administration, but the stakes are too high not to act and not to speak up.

It feels like a no-brainer to me to share and to put my name on this.

Pete, what about you?

Warden: Much like Lisa, there were a lot of reasons behind this for me, but a big one was seeing how much courage the people of Minneapolis were showing. They are literally putting their bodies at risk of being beaten to save their neighbors. So the fact that nobody in the tech industry was willing to risk a ding to their career in order to actually do whatever we can to stop this happening, to save people's lives, I felt like it was the least I could do.

I spent five years at Apple, seven years at Google, and a lot of my colleagues are too afraid to speak up. I'm a startup founder, so there may be retaliation if I can't raise funding for my startup, because people like Marc Andreessen do hold a lot of sway in the industry, but I'm not gonna get fired. A lot of my former colleagues are rightfully afraid that they will get fired if they speak up.

I want to ask you about the difference you've seen in the tech industry from the first Trump administration to today. How would you characterize the way that tech leadership has shown up? What about the workers? What has changed in that decade?

Conn: I think there's been a pretty significant power shift away from the employees in the tech industry and in most industries. Until about 2021, retaining employees was a top business priority. It really mattered to companies. Talent was considered the most precious resource, and companies couldn't hire fast enough.

Perks were abundant, and layoffs hadn't really happened. It was considered bad leadership and a failure as a CEO to lay people off. Mark Zuckerberg was very proud of his record of never having laid people off at Meta. So employees had a lot of power. We saw this in 2020, at the peak of the movement after George Floyd's death and the DEI moment where employees put a lot of pressure on the employers to make statements, to stand up, to speak out.

A lot did performatively, maybe some authentically. But it was clear that employees had a lot of power. As the economy started to shift and companies started to do layoffs in 2021, 2022, employees lost a lot of that power because retaining them wasn't as important. Coinbase was a real leader in this way. Coinbase was one of the first big companies to do layoffs, and Brian Armstrong was one of the first CEOs to say there should be no talk about politics in the workplace. So there was this correction that happened in 2021, 2022, where companies were much less willing to listen, because listening to their employees just didn't matter as much.

If they wanted to leave, they could leave. It would save the company in severance. I think that's one big distinction in the dynamic of worker power in the tech industry, and probably also in other industries. I imagine this is gonna shift back. These things always do, but we are still in a moment where employee power is not as high as it was a decade ago, and certainly five years ago.

Warden: If I can add to that, I think another aspect is there's a lot more willingness from the administration to go after people in industry who step out of line.

If you are a tech CEO with a large company and you do not kiss the ring, you are gonna be targeted. You are gonna have the power of the federal government used against you in a vindictive way. So in some ways, I actually sympathize with the CEOs, because this is not a choice that anybody ever expected to have to make between free speech and having your company destroyed.

At the same time, I think this is an open question—and Lisa, you alluded to this a minute ago. How much of what happened on the part of tech executives from 2016 to 2020 was performative and how much of that was sincere? I wonder to what extent some of them now see this as an open invitation to be who they really are and to practice what they have wanted to do for a long time.

Conn: I am generally an optimist, and I generally think that people are good, and when people aren't good it's because of their circumstances, not any kind of innate evil. My sense of the psychology of a lot of tech CEOs, especially those who are also founders—and this is speaking as a founder myself—is at some point the company becomes their ideology. And protecting the company, keeping the company safe, succeeding, protecting employees, shareholders, if you have them, investors, et cetera, is the ideology. It is the prevailing motivator.

I think when the culture and the power dynamics are such that being on one side of an issue is more favorable, it's easier to speak up. And when there could be harm to the thing that feels like life-or-death for you as a founder, it's a lot harder just to speak up and to be critical. It's hard for me to truly believe that in a decade people's ideals and values—people, meaning tech CEOs—have completely changed.

Everything I know about how people change their minds and what persuades people suggests that doesn't really happen. So I don't think it's that this moment is somehow giving them permission to be their true selves, but rather that it is more beneficial to companies in 2026 to be quiet. I think that's what's unique about this moment and so important about this moment is, maybe that was true two weeks ago, but I actually don't think that's necessarily true anymore.

Right.

Conn: A key distinction between 2016 and now that we didn't speak about is how much more brutal the Trump administration is, how much greater Trump's corruption is, and so much more blatant.

There are a lot of things that are harmful to the tech industry. The very foundation of the tech industry, scientific research, has been cut and is underfunded, economic stability is at risk, our ability to attract global talent—all these things are hurting, and that is going to hurt these companies in turn.

Still, if this continues, I think we could reach CEOs of the top 10 tech companies and ask them to speak up because their companies are at risk.

Pete, anything to add on that?

Warden: I can't know what's in people's hearts, but there's been this dynamic—we used to lionize tech startup founders; they would be held in universally high esteem. Everybody thought what they were doing was cool. And the tech industry won, we became a dominant industry, and that came with a whole different dynamic around being held accountable, people not liking everything you're doing.

I really feel like that shift from being given a lot of leeway because you were the scrappy underdog to owning massive parts of the economy means that you are gonna get a lot more criticism. I have to believe that that was shocking to a lot of people, a lot of the top-end tech CEOs, who'd been used to very friendly treatment by the media and the public. Suddenly they were being treated like the CEO of Exxon or something, and that had to be a shock.

Conn: I think it's hard for people to change their self-perception away from being the underdog. When you're the underdog, punching is not as bad as when you are the bully and you're punching down. So if you see yourself as punching up, but the world sees you as punching down, it's challenging to change that.

Lisa, you mentioned a minute ago that what has happened in Minneapolis in the last few weeks has tipped the scales. It has really changed the conversation. I'm curious to hear from both of you what the conversation among your colleagues has been like over these past few weeks. What are people saying? What are they worried about? What are they thinking?

Conn: One thing I've observed is this is not just folks on the left. There's a really, really big tent. We're hearing from people who identify as moderates and independents and libertarians and Republicans, and people who have never really been politically active before. We're seeing that people in a big range of roles—engineers, CEOs, directors, VPs, people at the big tech companies, people at the AI labs, startup founders, VCs—have been troubled about this administration from the beginning, but these violent attacks on our neighbors and desire to suppress dissent is a breaking point. We've seen in the last 18, 19 days since this pledge has circulated, exponential growth and interest from all these companies across the political spectrum and across a variety of roles. That is unique.

Warden: Even people who do not follow politics, and I can totally understand why people do not want to deal with everything that's been going on for the last few years, just people couldn't ignore that and people really responded to that by saying, look, this is wrong. Like this is obviously wrong, and I think that that has been the big difference I've seen in conversations with people across the political spectrum.

When WIRED first reported on this open letter a couple weeks ago, you had a few hundred signatures. You now have over a thousand in just a few days. That is remarkable. But the tech industry is a huge business. Amazon alone employs over a million people in the United States. Pete, you talked earlier about fear. I have to ask, why do you think this list isn't in the tens or hundreds of thousands of names by now? Where is everybody else?

Warden: There's a very real fear of retaliation if you are in a big tech company. By speaking out, you are marking yourself as somebody that the Trump administration will demand be fired, or the tech company will suffer harm to its business. Even if you are a startup. We think of startups as these crazy renegades, who sort of march to the beat of our own drummer, but the reality of the venture capital industry is if somebody like Marc Andreessen is saying he will not do business with people who are against the Trump administration—which really feels like a lot of what's coming from some of the top people in the VC industry, even VCs who are sympathetic—they're gonna have to do deals with Andreessen Horowitz in the future.

So just having a few key influential people in the venture capital industry means that even startups who are all supposed to be about “think different” and all of these other slogans we've been throwing around for years, glorifying ourselves, there's actually a very centralized system that makes it very costly to go against the handful of big figures who are at the top of this industry.

Have either of you spoken with anyone directly who didn't want to sign on, who decided not to?

Warden: I definitely have multiple people at Google that I've spoken to who are absolute believers in this, but they are too afraid to put their names behind this.

Conn: People I've spoken to are putting their ethics above any fears that they have. I've talked to a couple people who said, “I don't think I'm allowed to sign this.” That was sort of the end of it. But those same people might be more comfortable posting internally in Slack or having a conversation internally in Slack.

For instance, there was reporting that there was a Slack channel within Palantir where folks were expressing concerns about this. That's a different effort than our effort, which is great. If employees of companies get inspired reading about this or seeing it, but maybe feel that handling things internally is more effective, that's fabulous. Do it.

I wanted to ask you about Palantir, actually. Some companies' work is tied to ICE, and reliant on government contracts. So the argument goes that companies being asked to cancel the contracts they have with ICE, which is one of the asks in the ICEout.tech letter, might not be in the realm of possibility. How do you respond to that idea?

Warden: If you look at Palantir, it's not like they're gonna go bust if they turn down the ICE contracts. I think what a lot of people aren't realizing on the business side is that Trump is not gonna be in power forever, and people are looking at what these companies are doing. For the long term, people are not going to forget that Palantir was a key enabler of ICE. That has benefits for them right now with this administration, but down the line, they have publicly allied themselves as keen supporters of this horrific brutality. Even not thinking about morality, that's not gonna be good for business.

It's short-term thinking versus long-term, absolutely. Do you both feel, from your own experience, does that kind of internal pressure work? Are they listening? Is it effective?

Conn: Kim Scott, a former Google employee and amazing author, wrote about this effect for The New York Times last year where she talked about how CEOs are rarely the first to break with perceived political consensus, and that only when they feel pressure from a range of folks in their organizations, from their peers, from their friends and family, and from their employees, will they seriously consider shifting their positions.

So yes, if it becomes untenable, it does work. We've seen Sam Altman make a statement internally in response to pressure from employees. We've seen Dario and Daniela from Anthropic, and a number of other leaders have made statements in response to this. So it does work. There's no question that it works.

What I think is interesting is we may not know what's working because it is totally fair game for CEOs, who maybe are in tuxedos at movie screenings at the White House, to be having private conversations that are never reported. That may be more effective than making public statements; that may be more effective than speaking up at an all-hands meeting and making declarative statements.

Trump was in Washington over the weekend and he was with a lot of these people this weekend. It does seem as of [Wednesday] that things are changing in Minnesota. So we may not know exactly what's going on, but there's no question that being a thorn in the side of a lot of these leaders, they notice that there's a thorn in their side, and they wanna pull it out one way or another.

Sure.

Warden: Just to add to that, one of the first places that pressure shows up is in recruiting. Even though general tech employees are now treated as essentially disposable, and they've lost a lot of their bargaining power and leverage, in the field of AI, there's still very fierce competition for talent.

If you are an AI researcher and you're looking around and you look at a company that's doing all of this really controversial, brutal stuff, that's not gonna be attractive to you. You're gonna worry about your own reputation, having that on your résumé. So that's the most immediate place where once candidates start turning down offers at these companies, and the feedback is that they don't want to work for somebody who's causing this much harm, that is very quick to go up the chain in my experience.

That's a good point. You mentioned that several of these executives were at the Melania screening at the White House over the weekend, but you're right that prior to that, and then subsequently this week, Tim Cook issued a public statement. Sam Altman issued a statement internally. What do you make of that? Is it too little, too late? Does it feel performative, or are you of the mind that the more of these leaders speaking out the better?

Conn: I applaud it.

You applaud it.

Warden: Absolutely, like come join us. This is a broad coalition. This is not about purity tests. This is about trying to make practical change happen. Anybody who's helping with that, we are super happy to be working alongside them.

Who are we still waiting to hear from? Whose voice in this have we not heard, who might really move the needle? Who really matters in Silicon Valley?

Conn: Alphabet. I don't know if we're getting anything, but who knows what's being said behind closed doors.

Warden: As a startup founder, I'm hoping to see more from the venture capital industry. Like I said, the dynamics of that industry make it very hard to break from the pack. Even though everyone likes to think of themselves as contrarian, the costs of doing that in the VC industry can be very high.

Once it becomes acceptable to speak out about this, I think that that's gonna open up. You know, Vinod Khosla, who was an investor in my first startup, it's been great to see him being very vocal about comments by [Khosla Ventures partner] Keith Rabois that were pretty ghoulish.

These are the comments on X.

Warden: Exactly. So I want to give Vinod props. He's one of the giants of the industry, so having him come out and say that, I was so thankful to see that. I'm really hoping we get to see more leaders like him coming out and doing the right thing.

I wanted to ask you both, before we wrap up, about the nature of being a startup founder. Pete, you've mentioned it a few times. You're both entrepreneurs, right? You are not strangers to relying on VC money to fund your companies. A lot of startup founders, as you've said, have chosen to stay quiet when it comes to politics. They don't want to put their business at risk. What do you say to them, if any are listening, about that stance and that decision?

Warden: I just say, do what you can. You know, I'll never judge. I'm never gonna judge somebody for not sticking their neck out because, you know, I'm older. I'm not gonna be out on the street if I get blacklisted. A lot of younger entrepreneurs don't have that privilege, and what I would say is just please try and find other ways to help. Try and get involved with your local community. You know, in San Francisco we are still having the Tesla Takedown protests a year after it started. I sometimes show up there in a Portland frog costume to dance around.

Do you really?

Warden: I do, yeah. I can send you the video.

Please do.

Warden: If you feel like, “I didn't have any way of using my voice in tech to protest what was happening, but hey, I could turn up on a street corner and dance around like a goofball,” it will make you feel better.

It helps the world, but you will also not feel powerless, which is what I hear from a lot of startup founders right now. They don't know what to do. They hate this, but they feel so constrained. And that's where it doesn't have to be public, it doesn't have to be a big statement. Just join the community that's formed around this. Just help with donations. Anything you can do. Internal conversations. There's lots of ways to help that don't involve a high level of risk.

Conn: I have two thoughts. One, I don't think being opposed to state-sanctioned violence and being lied to by our government leaders is very controversial. There's a large range of things that you could be worried about and be vocal about. This is one that I don't think is that controversial. So if this is the moment where you feel compelled to speak up and you're a little afraid, I think the risk is low, personally.

The second thing I will say to startup founders is: Focus on building a great company. If you build a great company, people will want to invest. Investors are capitalists, they're not ideologues, most of them.

If you are ideologically in opposition to one that is an ideologue, they might not be a good fit for you anyway. So focus on building a great company. If you build something great, if you do something interesting, investors want to be part of it. They won't necessarily care that you oppose state-sanctioned violence. Be respectful and diplomatic. You don't need to be extreme about anything. I don't think it's effective most of the time. Assuming that you're respectful, but you speak your mind and you speak your truth and build a great company at the same time, I think you're OK. I think investors will still be thrilled to write you a check.

Warden: If I can just jump in on that as well, if you can get to cash-flow positive, then the dynamic changes. So get those customers, get that revenue that buys you the power, that buys you the freedom. That's part of why I'm willing to stick my neck out. I know if funding dries up we have customers who are paying us money, and we can make the rent and we can make payroll.

Yeah, exactly what you're saying, Lisa, just build the company and you do get a lot of ability to really get your voice out there once you've done that.

The list has over a thousand signatories. What's next? Are you guys collectively planning anything else? How do you maintain and build on the momentum that you have?

Conn: We wanna get to 2,000. That's our next goal.

I have every confidence that you will.

Warden: And these are verified signatures, so I think there are more being verified, but each one of these is verified and we confirm it's a real person.

From my side, and this is still an idea that's just bubbling around my head, not an official idea from ICEout.tech, but I would love to have an in-person meetup in San Francisco. Let people just see and hear that there are all of these other people who share the same beliefs, who believe this is wrong.

We've seen in Minneapolis the power of people coming together. I really want this to be the start of us forming a community that's dedicated to being decent to people. It doesn't have to be political beyond, “Hey, let's stick to the Constitution. Let's care about human rights. Let's not murder people in the street.”

Thank you both, so much. And Pete, if you go ahead with that meetup, please give WIRED a heads-up.

Xbox gamers have seen their share of struggles lately.

AAA gaming has been having a rough go of it the last few years. Microsoft's latest fiscal reports revealed a whopping $623 million drop in gaming revenue, compared to the same fiscal quarter last year.

The figure is bad enough on its own, but it gets worse when you realize that it represents a 9% year-on-year drop. Microsoft attributes the financial hit to "declines in Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services", letting on that Xbox consoles, games, and Game Pass sold 32% less than the same quarter a year ago.

Xbox fans have faced their share of struggles recently, with Microsoft hiking Game Pass prices three times in as many years, and increasing the price tag on the Xbox consoles not just once but twice in the same year (making them much pricier than the PlayStation) all while removing benefits.

If you're an Xbox gamer, Microsoft still promises it's in it for the long haul, as last October the company pinky-promised that it's not exiting the gaming market.

Microsoft is making more money than ever, but the "More Personal Computing" category, where the gaming income is included, represents only about 20% of the company's revenue. Some back-of-envelope math puts the Xbox section at around a third of that, thus at best an estimated 7% of the company's total revenue, depending on how you run the figures.

With Azure, cloud services, and the investment in OpenAI all seeing meteoric rises every quarter, it's not hard to see where the focus of the company is right now. Predictions that "gaming is dead" might be ten a penny, but the harsh reality is that just as with Nvidia, Intel, or AMD, Microsoft dropping a small portion of its business (or at least putting a hold on it) would hardly matter that much for its bottom line. At least the silicon shortage may lead to more optimized, and hopefully, original games.

About a decade ago, many media outlets—including WIRED—zeroed in on a weird trend at the intersection of mental health, drug science, and Silicon Valley biohacking: microdosing, or the practice of taking a small amount of a psychedelic drug seeking not full-blown hallucinatory revels but gentler, more stable effects. Typically using psilocybin mushrooms or LSD, the archetypal microdoser sought less melting walls and open-eye kaleidoscopic visuals than boosts in mood and energy, like a gentle spring breeze blowing through the mind.

Anecdotal reports pitched microdosing as a kind of psychedelic Swiss Army knife, providing everything from increased focus to a spiked libido and (perhaps most promisingly) lowered reported levels of depression. It was a miracle for many. Others remained wary. Could 5 percent of a dose of acid really do all that? A new, wide-ranging study by an Australian biopharma company suggests that microdosing's benefits may indeed be drastically overstated—at least when it comes to addressing symptoms of clinical depression.

A Phase 2B trial of 89 adult patients conducted by Melbourne-based MindBio Therapeutics, investigating the effects of microdosing LSD in the treatment of major depressive disorder, found that the psychedelic was actually outperformed by a placebo. Across an eight-week period, symptoms were gauged using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a widely recognized tool for the clinical evaluation of depression.

The study has not yet been published. But MindBio's CEO Justin Hanka recently released the top-line results on his LinkedIn, eager to show that his company was “in front of the curve in microdosing research.” He called it “the most vigorous placebo controlled trial ever performed in microdosing.” It found that patients dosed with a small amount of LSD (ranging from 4 to 20μg, or micrograms, well below the threshold of a mind-blowing hallucinogenic dose) showed observable upticks in feelings of well-being, but worse MADRS scores, compared to patients given a placebo in the form of a caffeine pill. (Because patients in psychedelic trials typically expect some kind of mind-altering effect, studies are often blinded using so-called “active placebos,” like caffeine or methylphenidate, which have their own observable psychoactive properties.)

This means, essentially, that a medium-strength cup of coffee may prove more beneficial in treating major depressive disorder than a tiny dose of acid. Good news for habitual caffeine users, perhaps, but less so for researchers (and biopharma startups) counting on the efficacy of psychedelic microdosing.

“It's probably a nail in the coffin of using microdosing to treat clinical depression,” Hanka says. “It probably improves the way depressed people feel—just not enough to be clinically significant or statistically meaningful.”

However despairing, these results conform with the suspicions of some more skeptical researchers, who have long believed that the benefits of microdosing are less the result of a teeny-tiny psychedelic catalyst, and more attributable to the so-called “placebo effect.”

In 2020, Jay A. Olson, then a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, conducted an experiment. He gave 33 participants a placebo, telling them it was actually a dose of a psilocybin-like drug. They were led to believe there was no placebo group. Other researchers who were in on the bit acted out the effects of the drug, in a room treated with trippy lighting and other visual stimulants, in an attempt to curate the “optimized expectation” of a psychedelic experience.

The resulting paper, titled “Tripping on Nothing,” found that a majority of participants had reported feeling the effects of the drug—despite there being no real drug whatsoever. “The main conclusion we had is that the placebo effect can be stronger than expected in psychedelic studies,” Olson, now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, tells WIRED. “Placebo effects were stronger than what you would get from microdosing.”

More than a stick in the eye to the microdosing faithful, Olson maintains that the study's key findings had more to do with the actual role, and power, of the placebo effect. “The public has a lot of misconceptions about the placebo effect,” he says. “There's this assumption that placebo effects are extremely weak, or that they're not real.”

Olson goes on to say that placebo effects in psychedelic trials can be further juiced by the hype around the drugs themselves. Patients may enter a trial expecting a certain experience, and their mind is able to conjure a version of that experience, in turn. In Olson's study, it wasn't a matter of microdosing effects not being real, but that those effects may be caused by environment, or patient expectation. As he puts it: “It can be true at the same time that microdosing can have positive effects on people, and that those effects are perhaps almost entirely placebo.”

This itself raises a sticky question about MindBio's study. How could a placebo group, who thinks they're taking LSD, perform better than an active control group, members of which both think they're taking LSD and are actually taking it? The answer comes from the design of the study itself.

Using what's called a “double-dummy” design, MindBio's researchers informed patients that they'd either be receiving LSD, a caffeine pill, or a dose of methylphenidate, better known as Ritalin or Concerta. (No patients were actually administered the methylphenidate.) This means that patient expectation was lowered, as they could ascribe any perceived effects to either the LSD or either of the active placebos. Patients taking LSD microdoses may well have believed they were merely on a stimulant. All patients followed an adaptation of the “Fadiman protocol,” a popular microdosing programme that sees patients taking a small dose of the given drug once every three days.

Jim Fadiman, the veteran psychedelic researcher after whom the protocol is named, rejects MindBio's conclusions, and trial design, out of hand. Because, Fadiman believes, patients were given the active caffeine placebo, their reported benefits may well be attributable not to a pure placebo effect, but to the actual psychoactive properties of that drug.

“Double-dummy is a remarkably apt term,” Fadiman, 86, sneers. “What I know is that if you take enough caffeine, you will not be depressed!”

Fadiman points to MindBio's earlier, Phase 2A study, recently published in the journal Neuropharmacology, which drew markedly different conclusions. It was a non-blinded, so-called “open label” study, meaning patients knew definitely that they were being microdosed with LSD. This study found that MADRS scores decreased by 59.5 percent, with effects lasting as long as six months. It also found improvements in stress, rumination, anxiety, and patient quality of life. Fadiman says that this reportage is more consistent with his own research on microdosing. “Their prior study did wonderfully with LSD,” Fadiman says. “I have collected literally hundreds of real world reports over the years that validate those findings.”

MindBio's Hanka stands by the science. “We are bewildered at the significant difference between the open label Phase 2A trial results and the Phase 2B trial results,” he says. “But that is the nature of good science—a properly controlled trial will get a proper result. Our Phase 2B trial was of the highest standard, a triple-blind, double-dummy, active placebo controlled trial. I haven't seen another psychedelic trial that has gone to these lengths to control and blind a trial.”

Despite these findings, some microdosing true believers don't seem especially shaken. In 2017, writer Ayelet Waldman (best known as the author of the Mommy-Track Mysteries series of novels that follow the adventures of stay-at-home-mom-cum-sleuth Juliet Applebaum) published A Really Good Day, a diaristic account of her own self-experiments using microdosing to treat an intractable mood disorder. She tells WIRED she's not especially bothered by the implication that her positive shifts in mood may have merely been placebo. “In my book I took very seriously the possibility that what I was experiencing was the mother of all placebo effects,” Waldman says. “I wrote about this a number of times in various chapters and decided in the end it didn't matter. What mattered was that I felt better.”

Perhaps that's true enough. If the effects are measurable, and repeatable, then it should hardly matter if they're attributable to a sub-perceptual dose of lysergic acid, or to the (perhaps equally profound) mysteries of the placebo. Still, one cannot help but wonder why anyone looking to use LSD to aid severe clinical depression would bother assuming the legal risk of procuring and consuming a drug still classified under Schedule I by the US Drug Enforcement Administration.

Certainly, for his part, Justin Hanka seems content to pivot MindBio's research into a new field. His next project is “Booze A.I.”: a smartphone app that uses artificial intelligence to scan the human voice for relevant biomarkers that determine blood alcohol concentration. He's leaving microdosing in the rearview. “I put millions of dollars into this myself,” he says. “Had I known six years ago what I know about psychedelics, I probably wouldn't have ventured into the microdosing field.”

And now it doesn't even split games in "Linux" vs "Windows"; it simply assumes all games run on Linux. And they mostly do! Though to be fair I had to tweak a couple to make them run, and Space Marine II absolutely refuses to play past the cutscene, but most other games "just work".

Valve has good, stable funding to pay a team full time to build and support Steam OS which, over a long period of time and with enough user uptake, I think will have better chances of getting publishers on board with ensuring their games work on something that isn't Windows. Hell, they could probably make deals with publishers to say "hey, here's a pile of money to make sure your game works on Steam OS day 1, and put it in all the ads" and get the ball rolling that way.Gaming is a tough space to crack. I think Valve's money and their history of supporting the most popular gaming platform on PC inspires more trust needed to make their platform a standard target.

It wasn't that long ago that Wine was only really useful for games that were at least 5-10 years old. Proton is amazing.

There are many older games I can't install on Linux anymore, because they used an older SDL1 or some particular X11 version or some GPU driver that's no longer available for the current kernel.The exact same game, Windows version, can be installed and runs flawlessly on both Linux and Windows.So, native Vulkan executables?  Sure, if they can continue to run in 20 years.

I don't think so. I rather do believe that many game developers would actually love to give a more native approach for writing GNU/Linux games a try (to make this point more plausible: game developers are very used to game-console-native SDKs).But what these game developers really demand is a very stable user-space API for everything that is necessary for writing games, which will work reliably on basically every GNU/Linux distribution, and will be supported for at least 20 years.

Sure, the platform is enshittified spyware, but that only impacts the game devs on their work machines (which are probably locked down to protect secret IP anyway).

I don't think this is a given.

You're making a huge assumption here. I think that's a really small percentage. Most people game on PC because certain games they like to play are only on PC, or are much better suited to PC, or because their friends are on PC, or because they want to play on the go (Steam Deck is very recent and still not widely used), or because they need to have a PC anyway. Or because they grew up with it at home/in the neighborhood because there was no money for a console. Or because "Because they like building their system", I'm going to peg at <10%.

But I still feel like we're still in the eye of the storm, and things will improve. Remember late 2020 when every useless GPU would command a fortune? I remember buying a used RX 5600 XT with a warranty somewhere around October for 300 €. A month later, it would cost at least twice as much, if you could even find one in stock. Last December I looked a bit at prices, and the current equivalent model (9060xt 16 GB) was roughly around 300 again, and I don't think it has gone up since. I understand there may be a shortage of equivalent Nvidia GPUs from a thread the other day, so this may change soon, again. I have no use for top-of-the-line models, so I'm not familiar with their prices and availability.

reply

Truly I have seen not even a hint of reason to believe prices would come back down in the near term.

And this won't change a thing: it doesn't matter if they make a Linux-native frontend to the horrible GOG Galaxy. I just want my games to launch as seamlessly as they do from Valve's UI, not yet another launcher that I have to launch on top of Valve's system UI. I am already doing that with Heroic Games Launcher, which is far better than whatever they will concoct in-house and supports many other stores.

reply

reply

Valve integrated steam all the way down to the OS level to do all that. GOG galaxy meanwhile is focusing more on being an accompanying app to optionally use than centralizing everything under GOG. I think Galaxy trying to strive to be as "seamless" will break the very philosophy of GOG to begin with; being a store to grab games you truly own, not a platform to immerse yourself in.

I don't use Galaxy at all. My GOG games work on Linux. It's a good company.

I don't really want to see locked down hardware in the space any more than there already has been (Nintendo, Sony, X-Box, etc)... I think the PC centered gaming community largely wants a more open platform in general.  In the long run, I don't see a lot of solid competition... especially with ever growing legacy libraries of content.

reply

If people really want Linux to be a viable alternative to Windows, run by a majority of the general public, it has to be possible to sell closed-source software that runs on it (where "it" means a broad range of different distros).Yes, that means less freedom concerning that particular software. But without it, the platform is a tiny niche that's easily run over by the hardware OEMs.

There's definitely a desire for an appliance/console like experience where all the complexity is hidden behind install/play buttons, and steam has got most of the way there. As protondb shows that can't go all the way and tweaking is needed owing to the shifting PC compatibility in general and running software from one OS on a different one, it's the nature of the beast. Personally pushing towards monoculture on an open platform needs to be tempered, and there's a lot of debate previously for other places where that's relevant.

This is one of the areas where GOG Galaxy has tried to stand out. It supports integrations with other launchers in Python: https://github.com/gogcom/galaxy-integrations-python-apiIt's intended for the other direction of other launchers (or third party integrations with other launchers) feeding data to GOG Galaxy, but it's still one of the more interesting attempts in the wild of a launcher trying to be a little bit more than just a walled garden.I don't know if in an Official Linux port of Galaxy if they'll try to find more ways to integrate beyond what they've already done with their Python API and how much they would be willing work with other launchers, especially Heroic, but of the big game stores, GOG seems one of the few that actually wants to try. Maybe they will. It would be nice to see. It's interesting seeing so many comments assume the worst of them, as someone who has played around with that Python API a little bit. (I was toying with a third-party Itch.io integration. Didn't get very far, but it was neat what seemed possible.)

In my experience GOG bought games handled by Lutris/Heroic/Mini Galaxy trump Steam in convenience almost every time. There's been quite a few deal breaking issues with Steam client and/or Proton that went unaddressed by Valve for months that just never happened to me on the GOG+game manager combo. (Remember the most recent Steam rewrite that made certain UI elements not work on Linux and which still needs a workaround option in the client years later?) All that on top of another application requiring full browser engine under the hood eating resources just to be able to launch a game. I don't know if I am just extremely unlucky to get hit with every Linux related issue on Steam and notice its drawbacks or if people are offering Valve unreasonably high leniency, because they see then as some sort of champion of gaming on Linux, while not giving enough to other players like GOG.Pardon my rant.

Game launchers are a good idea that lots of people want. A good game launcher needs both deep game integration and an online account, to provide save game syncing, joining friends and updating games.

I think GOG is saying a lot of the right things in terms of Game Preservation being a long term goal for them. I think they are between a rock and a hard place that the store would be a lot less active if they couldn't offer the latest games from companies like Sony, and they want to be on good terms with such companies to get access to their giant back catalogs for Preservation efforts which also presumably includes sales numbers of recent titles for justification.But yes, I'd also love to see them push back a bit harder on some of these publishers a bit further than "needs an offline-capable installer" and mabye include more steps towards some definition of "should run offline-capable", because yeah things like "Live Services" and account systems and mandatory telemetry systems and rootkit anti-cheat systems are often de facto DRM just wearing another hat of "user convenience" or "achievement tracking" or "game safety" tools. I don't think GOG can make that push alone, though. There are too many industry trends to try to buck to get further in those directions. (Thinking about the recent Anthem shutdown as a recent for instance of a mostly single player game that is entirely unplayable because EA shutdown live services this month.)

There's nothing in the Crime Cities GOG forum about this, nor in the various tracking threads in the main forum, and generally GOG users are extremely sensitive about anything which even reeks of forcing Galaxy, so I'd strongly expect any issue to be known.I've seen cases where the developer implemented a bad online check, so that if you blocked the program from accessing the internet while the OS reported being online, the game would hang or crash, but being fully offline would work. Could it be that something like that was at play here? Oh, or that you simply picked the wrong installer for the game, and thus ran the Galaxy-installer rather than the offline installer?

If I can send you the private key and the game and it allows you to run the game with no further inputs, then the DRM is trivially broken (even without open source).If it does some online check, then if the source is open we can easily make a version that bypasses the online check.If there is some check on the local PC (e.g. the key only works if some hardware ID is set correctly), we can easily find out what it checks, capture that information, package it, and make a new version of the launcher that uses this packaged data instead of the real machine data.If you use a private key to go online and retrieve more data, having it be open source makes it trivial to capture that data, package it, and write a new version of the launcher that uses that packaged data.Basically, DRM requires that there is something that is not easy to copy, and it being open source makes it a lot easier to copy.

- the DRM/delivery software is open source- the game payload is sent to you encrypted using the public key of a secure enclave on your computer- while the game runs all its memory is symmetrically encrypted (by your own CPU) using a key private to that secure enclave. It is only decrypted in the CPU's cache lines, which are flushed when the core runs anything other than the game (even OS code)- the secure enclave refuses to switch to the context in which the CPU is allowed to use the decryption key unless a convolution-only (not overwriteable with arbitrary values) register inside itself had the correct value- the convolution-only register is written with the "wrong" value, by your own computer's firmware, if you use a bootloader that is not trusted by the DRM system to disallow faking the register (ie, you need secure boot and a trusted OS)That doesn't seem to fit in any of your models. There's no online check, you can't send someone else the key because it's held in hostile-to-you hardware, you can't bypass the local-PC check because it's entirely opaque to you (even the contents of RAM are encrypted). You can crack into a CPU itself I guess?I don't think the mechanism of the DRM being open source helps with the copying AT ALL in this design.This design is, by the way, quite realistic: most modern CPUs support MK-TME (encrypted RAM mediated by a TPM) and all Windows 11 PCs have a TPM. Companies just haven't gotten there yet.

So I guess the whole game software, or at least a significant part, is loaded encrypted and runs encrypted. It's on the users hardware but the user can't access it.The only thing I can think of: You say the game payload is encrypted using the public key of a secure enclave. This means the open source game launcher has to pass the public key to the server doing the encryption. Could you not supply a fake public key that goes to a virtual secure enclave? I guess the public key could be signed by intel or something, is that something that happens on current TPMs?Would it even be possible to do this if the program had to run under Proton/Wine? The original subject here is the launcher running on Linux.I do wander about the use of an open source launcher at this point though. As someone who prefers open source software, the idea of encrypted software running on my PC makes me uncomfortable, more than just closed source software.

It's been... amazing. A good game, running at workable framerates, no more crashes than usual (it's a Bethesda game, after all), and the software was free as opposed to building out a new PC with Windows 11.It's like rediscovering PC gaming after years of it becoming bloated and a cash grab.

Gamers used to own the games they purchased via cassettes, disks, and later even digital copies.

I know it's eastern Europe but that's $5000-7500 a month, barely $90k a year. It sounds like a solo job too so a lot of responsibility for this salary.

reply

$90K a year goes much further in most of Europe barring the centres of the biggest cities—let alone eastern Europe—than it does in the US.NYC and Bay Area salaries are outrageously inflated, with much of the take-home being funnelled into four/five digit rents or mortgages for houses built out of matchsticks, car loans, health insurance payments, and more. None of this is necessary or costs as much in most of Europe, or the rest of the world, really.

If you account for the fact that Poland is generally less expensive than the average and that the average monthly living cost is ~900 EUR ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?cou... ), even the 50k lower bracket is in the higher range. You get ~2k EUR net/month in your account after pension and tax contributions, health insurance, rent and expenses (as a single). That's not bad at all. EDIT: (excluding rent)

Pause for a moment and consider the mere plausibility of the claims in the first few paragraphs: The effect size for antidepressants is 0.4, but the effect size for Vitamin D is 1.8? Are we to believe that Vitamin D supplements have an effect size 4.5X larger than antidepressant drugs, and nobody noticed this massive discrepancy until now?Effect size is also a favorite metric in this vein of supplement-over-pharma writing because it's so commonly misunderstood and it's so easy to find small supplement studies that have outlier effect sizes.To put it in context, even common OTC pain meds can have effect sizes lower than 0.4 depending on the study. Have you ever taken Tylenol or Ibuprofen and had a headache or other pain reduced? Well you've experience what a drug with a small effect size on paper can do for you.Please be very careful when someone tries to tell you that supplements are miraculous and pharmaceutical drugs don't work at all. I know too many people who delayed trialing SSRIs for years due to internet driven fears and lost many years of their lives to depression based on content like this. People with cabinets full of dozens of supplement bottles that were chosen based on studies, too. Then they finally decided to try real antidepressant medications and wished they'd done it sooner.As much as I wish we could all just cure depression by taking a simple Vitamin D supplement that has 4.5X higher effect size than antidepressant drugs, this claim just isn't passable.

Hiking has the biggest effect though.I think maybe the problem is that therapists are diagnosing people, and psychiatrists are prescribing pills based on those diagnoses, but neither are ordering bloodwork to check for deficiencies.  Which leads to a lot of people suffering from lack of basic health, and treating the symptoms with SSRIs that have withdrawl symptoms a million times worse than most of the problems they treat.Now to your point, I seriously doubt that vitamin D will hold up against anti-depressants and therapy if we control for other health and quality of life issues.  I just think there is a ton of misdiagnosis, and lack of root cause analysis in the mental health field, and health care in general.

I don't have the energy to do all that when I'm down though. I hate all sports though I do like hiking (there's no team or competitive bullshit) but I'm too clumsy for it.

I remember reading that pine trees give off a chemical that is a natural human bronchodilator.One thought of why people love hiking, especially in piney woods, is that the chemical allows humans to process more oxygen which in turn helps them feel more "energized".I point this out for two reasons:1. It's a fascinating bit of trivie2. It highlights that there are MANY confounding variables so it will always be tough to figure out the isolated impact.

Oddly a lot of the “guys with road bikes wearing full gear” seem to just ride on the road anyway. I have no idea why, I've double checked the laws and I'm allowed to ride there.

A few months ago I tried walking with a weighted vest, and my body and brain got completely shocked in a really good way. Wakes up everything. So that is in my mix now.Walking with 20 then 40 lbs was a lot easier than I expected, and the results were much greater.

I can definitely tell that the Adderall I was prescribed had an immediate, huge benefit. Not sure about the vitamin D.But I really appreciated that he took a wide angle look at my health.

That statement is broadly true for most outcomes studied, but specifically for depression the larger study results are pretty mixed.VITAL (the heavily cited metastudy) shows no effect. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32749491/But there are other large metastudies like this one for Vit D (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39552387/) and this one for Omega 3 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31383846/) that do show robust moderate effects.

Either way, the conclusion to this whole debate is incredibly simple: get a blood panel done and go from there - it might not even be one of these that ails you.

What the article states, then fails to take into account, is that is the mean effect size, and there is huge variation.Anti-depressants are notorious for producing different effects for different people.What that high variance means in practice, is for any anti-depressant, the people who get good results are getting a much higher effect than 0.4. And the other people move on to try something else.So to keep comparing 0.4 directly to the effect of Vitamin D and Omega-3 directly is very misleading.

> Please be very careful when someone tries to tell you that supplements are miraculous and pharmaceutical drugs don't work at all.I'll concede I unintentionally gave the tone that one should replace antidepressants with supplements, even though the conclusion specifically writes: "(Don't quit your existing antidepressants if they're net-positive for you!) you may also want to ask your doctor about Amitriptyline, or those other best-effect-size antidepressants."I have now edited the intro to more explicitly say "you can take these supplements alongside traditional antidepressants!

Some of the available reviews, owing to the limited number of trials and methodological biases, were of low quality (Anglin et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2014; Shaffer et al., 2014). Considering these uncertainties, we aimed to fill this gap by conducting a systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) to determine the optimum dose and shape of the effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression and anxiety symptoms in adults regardless of their health status.===> even common OTC pain meds can have effect sizes lower than 0.4 depending on the study. Have you ever taken Tylenol or Ibuprofen and had a headache or other pain reduced? Well you've experience what a drug with a small effect size on paper can do for you.I must push back: that's an effect of 0.4 plus placebo effect and time.There's now RCTs of open-label placebos (where subjects are told it's placebo), which show even open-label placebos are still powerful for pain management.

There's now RCTs of open-label placebos (where subjects are told it's placebo), which show even open-label placebos are still powerful for pain management.

You're cherry picking papers.

No, the domain name is nature.com because it's in a Nature Publishing Group journal, Scientific Reports, which is their least prestigious journal.It's a common mistake, and they do that on purpose, of course, to leverage the Nature brand.It's also a mistake that implies a complete lack of familiarity with scientific publishing, unfortunately, which makes it a bit difficult to take your judgements regarding plausibility very seriously.

It's still peer reviewed, and as the sibling comment said, more applicable to this type of research. Also you now went from raising understandable objections to refusing the argument because it comes from a specific journal, which doesn't sound very scientific to me

We shouldn't have believed the study more if it actually had been in Nature.I don't think that's what I was saying, though.The issue in this thread was about taking a step back and looking at the overall plausibility of the conclusions, taking together multiple studies.I agree with the GP that the argument doesn't really pass the smell test.That's still the main issue, and it is something that people who don't understand scientific publishing struggle understanding/doing, because they lack the intuition for how certain results came about.

Basically, the possibility that the small study was underpowered, and just lucky...then the large studies with more power are closer to the truth.

Then the supposed big effect attracts attention and ultimately properly designed studies which show no effect.

1. Small studies are more likely to give anomalous results by chance. If I pick three people at random, it's not that surprising if I happened to get three women. It would be a lot different if I sampled 1,000 people.2. Studies that show any positive result tend to get published, and ones that don't tend to get binned.Put those together, and you see a lot of tiny studies with small positive results. When you do a proper study, the effect goes away. Exactly as you would expect.The less charitable effect is "they made it up". It happens.

If a minority of patients benefit hugely and most get no benefit, then you get a modest effect size.This is probably why this discussion always has a lot of people saying “yeah, it didn't help me at all” and a few saying “it changed my life.”I believe we should be focusing on more relevant statistical methods for assessing this hypothesis formally. Basically, using mean differences is GIGO if you assume you're comparing a bimodal or highly skewed distribution to a bell curve.

For the past 15-20 years, november thru february are basically a writeoff due for me due to seasonal affective disorder. Cold showers, exercise, no alcohol, strict sleeping rituals. Vitamin d. I can still sleep 11 hours and feel like reheated cat shit.Enter citalopram. "It will take up to six weeks to dial in" they said. Within four days I felt like the inside of my head was designed by Apple in their glory days. My mind became an orderly, well lit, tastefully designed space... instead of a dimly lit crack den. I'm more emotionally available, no longer tired, less cranky. I felt cozy. I could cry with joy because I could finally understand emotionally why people like the Christmas season.I won the SSRI lottery I guess, the side effect are sweaty feet, vivid dreams and a dry mouth. That's all.This just goes to show that for me, they're extremely effective.

Luckily, sertraline was an almost instant cure.I can come off it for periods, but it tends to reoccur after a while. So, it does mean I have to take a drug indefinitely, but is that really a problem? It turns my life into one worth living.The reason we can't take sleeping pills daily is because they stop working in fairly short order. But if, like antidepressants (typically), they didn't lose their effectiveness over time, would there even be a problem with using sleeping pills if you had trouble sleeping?

They also give you low quality sleep, because they just knock you out. It's not a natural kind of sleep.At least that's how it was a while ago. Maybe the situation has improved.

There actually is a condition that calls for extremely high (100mg+ doses), but it is a very rare thing, no one should ever consider that much without instruction from a doctor. But you'll find it right next to the normal <=5mg doses without any explanation.

Chemistry trumps psychology. Good enough chemistry enables cognitive treatments. But to fix the wrong chemistry you need chemistry.

reply

To nitpick: The mind is applied biochemistry. Psychology intervenes in the chemistry, like many other activities do. The goal of that is to solve the root cause so that your future levels will be maintained at the right level, instead of just forcing the level by sourcing the respective chemicals externally.A good rule of thumb in biology and particular any kind of hormone production and balance is "use it or lose it" - if you start regularly receiving something externally, internal production will scale back and atrophy in response, in many cases permanently.

We don't really know how SSRIs work, but there's some evidence that it's through desensitizing serotonin receptors, not directly addressing the lack of serotonin. If so, "use it or lose it" doesn't apply; long-term adaptation is the point, and SOMETIMES does persist after quitting.

reply

There are ways to "hack it".For example, ~6 months ago I started trt (testosterone replacement). It was the best decision health wise ever. I feel way better psychologically, first time in my life I managed to stick with cardio training for so long (before 3 months was the most). There are other benefits too.So what about the "loose it" part? Well there is a hormone called HCG one can take a twice a week to trick one's balls into producing some natural testosterone. Its use prevents atrophy and infertility.

Interesting.Well, I don't think you'll be able to avoid testicle atrophy even if it minimizes it, but the important part is understanding the tradeoff. Particularly, that adding testosterone will cause changes throughout your entire body (including, for example, shortening life expectancy a bit), and that adding other hormones to the mix will likewise cause changes around the entire body and not just one single process or organ.But it's your body, your life, your priorities and decision. I also wouldn't consider it a good decision health-wise to take steroids to get huge, but I have no problem with someone deciding that absurd bulk is their main goal in life and worth the tradeoff.

Very basic and very often wrong rule, so take it with a grain of salt.Insulin for example is the opposite. "lose it then use it" would be a general rule for type 2 diabetics where insulin resistance commonly due to weight gain is the primary problem. Losing the weight leads to better uptake and usage. For a type 1 "lose it then use it" you typically lose the ability to produce insulin to an an autoimmune disorder, then are stuck using insulin for the rest of your life.The body itself typically attempts to main homeostasis, but at population scales this is something that is going to have a massive range of ways it shows up. Evolution, at grand scales, doesn't care if you survive as long as enough of your population survives and breeds. At the end of the day you might just be one of those people that was born broken and to work properly you need replacement parts/chemicals. A working medical system should be there to figure out which case is which.

You're describing entirely orthogonal issues. In case of insulin resistance, your natural production is running full blast with demand exceeding supply because the consumer stopped caring about the hormone. In case of autoimmune disease, the natural production was killed - you can neither use nor lose what is already dead, and even if some capacity was left it will either soon be killed or atrophy under external insulin, but it will not be mourned.So no I would say it is exactly the same - "use it or lose it" - but that does not mean that there is never a reason to manually overrule your body's attempt at homeostasis through direct manipulation. It just means that there is a very significant consequence to the process.> The body itself typically attempts to main homeostasis, but at population scales this is something that is going to have a massive range of ways it shows up.As a somewhat sidenote, this is also why I dislike the idea of trying to classify people into "normal" and "divergent/atypical".

My personal preference is to always suggest getting actual daylight on your retina for 20 min three times a week. Not through glasses, including eyeglasses, but can be through eyelids. That loads transferatin, as in transfer, this loads the enzyme that make serotonin. This then allows the body a better chance to make the intermediate between Serotionin and Melatonin, and is the one believed to help.

I'm incredibly optimistic and am content with my position in life. My default state is being mindful of the present and I don't think about things too far into the future. I very rarely ever feel stressed out over things in life.However, none of that changes the fact that I feel completely empty and find no joy in things.

The only thing that helped those subjects was a regimen of personalized neuroimaging-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation for 10 minutes every hour for 10 hours every day for a week. Even then, it wasn't permanent. Some saw improvement for months, others only weeks.For some people, it's not just a matter of "perspective".

In case of depression in particular, it appears to be a label given to a big bag of various issues you may have causing similar symptoms.

reply

In my own opinion, we need to stop viewing "mental health" as a separate class of conditions from general/physical health. A mental illness is a health/medical condition just like any other and shifting our views and diagnostic criteria in that direction would do a lot to remove the stigma associated with mental illness.Someone with depression has a chronic illness, not a temporary "it's just in your head" condition.

It's not as liberating as you might think. A joyless existence is either suffering or nothingness. A life without meaning, either internal or external, is one where nothing is meaningful with no motivation thus one of crippling catatonia til death.All I can say is just that it doesn't feel good and if you can't feel good about anything, your calculus of your life inevitably leads to the conclusion that existence isn't worth it.

I didn't have anxiety, just depression. I rarely thought. I existed on autopilot. I was physically exhausted on a daily basis as a division 1 athlete in college. Often went days without eating either because I simply forgot to eat or forgot to make time for it between classes and training. Didn't change anything.I think something people are forgetting is that motivation is either driving you toward something you want or driving you away from things you specifically don't want. A complete lack of motivation means I wasn't motivated to do anything to get something, but also I wasn't motivated to anything to avoid something either. I wasn't motivated to eat to avoid hunger pangs. I wasn't motivated to quit my sport to avoid routine physical exhaustion. Instead, my empty autopilot existence just freely acted on the expectations of those around me as a proxy for motivation.

It's not at all clear that chemistry is the root issue. The brain is a synaptic graph that does something. Some graphs can have weird paths that lead to pathologies (maybe bad feedback loops). Chemistry seems like fairly a blunt instrument for bludgeoning a "bad" graph into one that's "better".Forced habits, like cognitive exercises from psychology, can sometimes rewire the graph by themselves because that's how the brain learns/adapts, but we still don't have a good grasp on how to do this truly effectively in many cases.That said, the blunt instrument of chemistry can sometimes be useful, particularly if it enhances neuroplasticity, as I think psychedelic research is beginning to show.

A few HN submissions recently are in the style "thinking about doing the thing is not doing the thing. Planning the thing is not doing the thing. <etc etc>. Only doing the thing is doing the thing". Comparing a brain to a large software project with bugs hiding in it, in that vein giving the computer 11 hours of 'sleep' each night is not debugging the code; overclocking or undervolting the CPU is not debugging the code; installing the latest updates and patches is not debugging the code. 'knowing there is nothing to worry about' is not debugging the code. Only debugging the code is debugging the code. Reading a badly explained idea on an internet comment and dismissing it with a mocking "thanks I'm cured" isn't debugging the code. Saying "I've tried everything" isn't debugging the code.A more specific example, if you are going on a rollercoaster and you are experiencing physical and mental symptoms of worry - nervous, anxious, angry at the person pushing you to ride, twitching and trying to back away, eyes looking around searching for an exit, coming up with excuses to do something else instead, nervous shaking, dread tightness in the chest, affected breathing, perspiring, gritted teeth, etc. etc. then washing over all that with "I know there is nothing to worry about so this must be a problem of brain chemistry" seems a clearly incorrect conclusion.Such a person clearly has a worry. Quite likely one that's out of proportion (e.g. "rollercoasters kill thousands of people every day!"). Possibly one that's completely incorrect (e.g. "going more than 10mph makes people's insides fall out!"). Quite likely a less clear and less obvious one - which could be anything, e.g. they saw a documentary about a rollercoaster which behaded a child and that's their only thought about rollercoasters; they saw a show about fighter pilots pulling high-G maneouvres and passing out and think that will happen to them on a big rollercoaster; they see the rollercoaster track and support flexing and don't understand that a some flexibility doesn't mean weakness; they went to a theme park as a child and older children bullied them into riding a scary ride and they wet themselves and figuratively died of shame and buried the memory; they were pushed into learning to drive at 15 by their wicked stepfather and this is pattern matching to the same kind of experience; etc. etc.Saying "there is nothing to worry about, rollercoasters are safe enough and you know it, so your brain chemistry must be broken" isn't debugging the problem.

Such a person clearly has a worry. Quite likely one that's out of proportion (e.g. "rollercoasters kill thousands of people every day!"). Possibly one that's completely incorrect (e.g. "going more than 10mph makes people's insides fall out!"). Quite likely a less clear and less obvious one - which could be anything, e.g. they saw a documentary about a rollercoaster which behaded a child and that's their only thought about rollercoasters; they saw a show about fighter pilots pulling high-G maneouvres and passing out and think that will happen to them on a big rollercoaster; they see the rollercoaster track and support flexing and don't understand that a some flexibility doesn't mean weakness; they went to a theme park as a child and older children bullied them into riding a scary ride and they wet themselves and figuratively died of shame and buried the memory; they were pushed into learning to drive at 15 by their wicked stepfather and this is pattern matching to the same kind of experience; etc. etc.Saying "there is nothing to worry about, rollercoasters are safe enough and you know it, so your brain chemistry must be broken" isn't debugging the problem.

Ha, of course it can be! Our brain chemistry is not stable through our life! Many children are born with epilepsy, but some people develop it later in life. epilepsy, like all neurological disorders are nature AND nurture, genes AND the environment.Using your roller coaster analogy, there very well may be genes that control; how much fear someone experiences when riding a roller coaster. The problem society has is telling people that they all should be able to not have feear riding a roller coaster and if youa re too afraid to ride a roller coaster you should take xanax.

Citation requested. Because, y'know, it's not like your leg muscles suddenly don't work from age 40-50 and then start working again and we say it's because of unstable "leg chemistry". It's not like your stomach, liver, kidneys, <organs> suddenly stop working after you lose your job or your life partner and we say it's both inexplicable and because of a deficit of "body chemicals" and nod agreement with each other that "body chemistry isn't stable" through a lifetime.These are just unsatisfyingly crappy non-explanations.And quick attempts to assume that Doctors, Neuroscientists, Psychiatrists, Psychologists must have a better detailed knowledge of brain chemistry and I'm just falling for nonsense seems to find that they actually don't, and they don't agree that "brain chemistry" is a good explanation, and it can't be measured in a patient, and the idea isn't strongly supported by evidence, and even the mechanism of action of "drugs which correct brain chemistry" isn't agreed on, and when given to people to "correct brain chemistry" it often doesn't make the problem that was blamed on brain chemistry go away.> "there very well may be genes that control; how much fear someone experiences when riding a roller coaster."I will lump "genetics" in as another pet-hate unsatisfyingly crappy non-explanation that people tag onto whatever they want so they can stop thinking about it further. There probably are many genes which affect how much fat bodies store, or burn, or food cravings, or what constitutes hunger, or production of various leptins and grehlins and insulins and stomach acids, but that doesn't mean "I'm obese because of my genetics" is any kind of explanation at all. Or "I have this personality because my parents and grandparents had it, it's genetic" is an explanation. Downe's Syndrome is a good use for genetics as an explanation. "I have a macro-scale set of vaguely related behaviours, symptoms and body effects and no clear cause, it's my genetics" isn't.Even if you have sequenced your genome, and have some specific gene that is associated with extra fat storage, genes can be turned on and off through a lifetime by behaviours and environment.

Ohhh, leg chemistry, good choice! You know that leg "chemistry" is control by neurotransmitter release, yes? So you must have never heard of Familial Periodic Paralysis then. Let me tell you what happens with that, because it happened to me while taking Seroquel. Familial Periodic Paralysis is also called Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and is due to mutations in the gene that encodes the alpha-subunit of the skeletal muscle sodium channel (SCN4A).https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1338/"The paralytic attacks are characterized by decreased muscle tone (flaccidity) more marked proximally than distally with normal to decreased deep tendon reflexes. The episodes develop over minutes to hours and last several minutes to several days with spontaneous recovery.Some individuals have only one episode in a lifetime; more commonly, crises occur repeatedly: daily, weekly, monthly, or less often. The major triggering factors are cessation of effort following strenuous exercise and carbohydrate-rich evening meals. "Look at that! Their muscles stopped and stared working again!And yes, this happened to me while taking seroquel because it lowered my potassium so much it affected my nervous system.Any good psychiatrist will tell you that they have no idea what is going on. But that does not mean neurotransmitters cannot be changed and that they do not effect behavior.> I will lump "genetics" in as another pet-hate unsatisfyingly crappy non-explanation that people tag onto whatever they want so they can stop thinking about it further.As someone who, as an armature geneticist, helped design a genetic study for Stanford, can I say that I put more energy into thinking about these things over the last 45 years than you can even imagine?>Or "I have this personality because my parents and grandparents had it, it's genetic" is an explanation.I have my hair color, height, skin color, all the physical traits from my parents, so why do you think the brain is not physical as well? Or or adrenal system? The brain is effected by genetics, this is true as has been shown clearly as a risk for schizophrenia. I have no idea why people think our mood, which is dictated by our thoughts which are created and sensed by our brain, which is a physical organ, does not have anything to do with genetics and neurotransmitters.and then you go on to talk about epigenetics, like that matters by genes don't? Do you know that genes control the epigentic response? Genes like DNMT1? So people with differences in DNMT1 will have different epigenetic responses?> I agree with this. Society likes assuming everyone is the same.So how are we different? nature AND nurture. Genes AND environment. I agree the solution to these problems are wrong, but your solution are just as bad as the ones your are prescribing.Listen, there are times when our neurtranmitters are supposed to be different, like when we are in pain or when some one dies. But some people, like me, have these changes regardless of the situation and we can like them to other environmental factors like diet, sunlight, weather, etc.I could tell you whey and why I think am so sensitive to the world but I doubt you would listen, because no one listens, because everyone knows.

Your second paragraph reveals a biased motive behind your opinion.I'm really tired of reading anti-medicine testimonials from people who had anecdotal bad results. Yes, penicillin won't stop antibiotic-resistant strains of some germs, and in fact may kill people like me if we take heavy doses. That's worse than what you're describing for SSRIs; does that mean doctors shouldn't prescribe it?

Doctors of all countries have been under a lot of pressure by patients and health administrators to "fix the issue and quick". The last thing that your doctor wants is giving you pills so you go away, but that's what the context very strongly incentivize. You want doctors to stop abusing pills, stop asking them for immediate fix. Give them less patients, more time and more resources to deal with the health of the population. Also, prevention.

She then proceeded to say "well I'll just write you the prescription anyway and you can do your research later and decide to fill it or not".> I was actually shocked by this interaction, and think about it often. She's a regular family doctor with the local hospital system, and this was just a regular checkup. I answered one question with a "yes, but it's manageable and I think I can handle it with lifestyle change" and then said no twice to medication and ended up with a prescription, which I ignored but don't appreciate having on my record, since it's a false indicator for future prescribing physicians.

Prevention is one of those things that when we actually attempt to fix it would have to completely change the world you live in.Humans are social creatures and a huge part of our mental health is dependant on the society around us. If the actual problem is "wow capitalism is really broken and showing us ads 24/7 that say were not good enough is killing us", then taking a pill is a valid solution because changing the system will take generations or very violent wars.

Not that my personal experience is actually a statistically significant sample, but I don't know anybody who takes sleeping pills. Or maybe I do, but they haven't told me. I've also never heard heavy sleeping pill use is one of the stereotypes about Americans. There are an estimated 342 million people in the United States, so impressions aren't always meaningful.

Because it's easy to say change your habits when the problems are systematic as you say. Cutting yourself off social media, or stopping watching the news isn't easy. Being bullied/stressed about work and not having other work options isn't easily dealt with. Being bombarded with advertising telling you that you suck is not something you can personally deal with.The US especially has this idea that we're all rugged individualists and any problem we have is our own and not one created by the larger society around us and therefor communal solutions are bad, and you should toughen up.

It's not a great idea to make general assumptions about such a large and diverse country. Some drugs may be over prescribed, I have no idea if Ambien is one of them, but trying to fit 340 million people across 50 states into the same box isn't going to be very accurate.

This has been true across two countries (Scotland, Hong Kong) and multiple doctors, with a third country's (China) doctor suggesting I try out sleeping tablets for a few weeks - and only giving me a very limited supply of them - to try out instead.I wonder if the "here take these" is a predominantly American phenomenon due to the weird incentives around health care costs (I'm being genuine here - maybe it's predominant in other countries too, I honestly don't know!)

But that's exactly what many claim. Even this article is trying to claim that Vitamin D has 4.5X higher effect size than antidepressants (e.g. that they don't work)> It's like if we took sleeping pills every time we had trouble sleeping. Having said that, I just realised I have the impression that's exactly what people do in the USA?USA is actually not the world leader in over medication in this domain, even though it's popular and safe to hate on Americans. The rates of benzodiazepine and Z-drug prescription in some countries like France are substantially higher than the USA.

Similarly, SSRIs have much better evidence in treatments for many other situations, like anxiety, and yet the medicine itself is attacked, not using it to poorly treat a disorder we barely even begin to understand.The "hate" is not based in science, despite the fact that SSRIs are objectively a mediocre treatment for depression.We just don't really have much in terms of better treatments because we know so damn little about depression.The medical community knows SSRIs are mediocre and have a low success rate at treating depression. They don't have better tools. Everything is a bad treatment for depression because "depression" is a loose collection of symptoms and statistics that we have really poor understanding of, and will certainly be broken up into the actual diseases that make it up when we figure them out, and we will be able to medicate those diseases more effectively.Every single doctor that would prescribe you an SSRI for your depression will also prescribe vitamin D supplementation if your blood shows low levels.Someday we will also have a situation where we are going to have to admit that for some subset of the population, their depression has no cause other than "Your life is utterly terrible, for reasons entirely outside of your control, and nothing I can do as a medical professional can fix that".

The lingering roots of Calvinism in the US cause us all kinds of problems."You were born broken because god made you that way, don't make yourself better, and hurry up and die" permeates huge parts of our culture. It's why lots of other cultures look at us and what we do with relative confusion.

I can't speak for USA but in parts of Europe a lot of people have PTSD that prevents normal sleep, so they end up on these pills, and then they end up with PTSD and worse insomnia caused by long term use of sleep meds.I think it's just incentives. Easier to take a pill than to deal with horrible trauma. And that probably stays true forever.

What is either revealing or terrifying is seeing how many people attempt to prevent that. Sexual abuse for example is pretty rampant in the US. Sexual education at a young age so people know they are being abused under no uncertain terms is a good solution for this.And yet you will run into far too many people that under no uncertain terms want their children to be excused from sex abuse education. What deeply concerns me is when you see people with this position that you know where sexually abused themselves.I don't know, people really suck.

I wish people would stop saying this.Our understanding of the brain is not sufficiently sophisticated to allow us to identify the "root cause" (whatever that means) of depression in most people.  Indeed we have no reason to believe that there even is a root cause to most people's depression.If you take antidepressants, go to therapy (or meditate or exercise or whatever), then go off them and still feel good, that's great.And if you take antidepressants indefinitely because doing so improves your life, that's also great!  Your life is improved!  This isn't an "abuse" of the drugs.No psychiatrist is making you do anything.  They're advising you based on their clinical judgement and experience, but ultimately it's your decision to take the pills or not.  If your goal is to go on antidepressants temporarily, any decent psychiatrist will support you in that (because, again, they understand that they can't make you take the pills one day longer than you want to).I've been on Lexapro and done evidence-based therapy for years.  They both have been helpful, but if I had to pick one, I'd immediately pick Lexapro.  For me it is a miracle drug.  And the miracle is, I can choose how I feel.(I also added a small dose of Buspar to help with the sexual side-effects.)If you're on the fence about trying an antidepressant, I really encourage you to talk to a psychiatrist.  If you try it and hate it, then you can stop.  But a lot of people try it and love it.  And I think a lot more people would be willing to try it if the notion that this is somehow "wrong" were gone.For further reading I recommend https://lorienpsych.com/2021/06/05/depression/.  I don't agree with everything Scott Alexander says, but his writing about mental health specifically has been useful to me.

Indeed we have no reason to believe that there even is a root cause to most people's depression.If you take antidepressants, go to therapy (or meditate or exercise or whatever), then go off them and still feel good, that's great.And if you take antidepressants indefinitely because doing so improves your life, that's also great!  Your life is improved!  This isn't an "abuse" of the drugs.No psychiatrist is making you do anything.  They're advising you based on their clinical judgement and experience, but ultimately it's your decision to take the pills or not.  If your goal is to go on antidepressants temporarily, any decent psychiatrist will support you in that (because, again, they understand that they can't make you take the pills one day longer than you want to).I've been on Lexapro and done evidence-based therapy for years.  They both have been helpful, but if I had to pick one, I'd immediately pick Lexapro.  For me it is a miracle drug.  And the miracle is, I can choose how I feel.(I also added a small dose of Buspar to help with the sexual side-effects.)If you're on the fence about trying an antidepressant, I really encourage you to talk to a psychiatrist.  If you try it and hate it, then you can stop.  But a lot of people try it and love it.  And I think a lot more people would be willing to try it if the notion that this is somehow "wrong" were gone.For further reading I recommend https://lorienpsych.com/2021/06/05/depression/.

For a long time I wrote off my symptoms as being all in my head. And after a formal diagnosis, I am 100% certain they are all in my head because that's where my brain is. Symptoms are also unequivocally psychosomatic. What I'm feeling can influence my physical symptoms and rather abruptly at that. It's right in the definition of the illness. None of this means that disease is imaginary or not real or I can talk myself out of it. It's as physically irreversible as losing an arm. There are some very good treatments, but I will never ever be cured (barring a miraculous breakthrough).While the causes of mood or personality disorders are less well understood, it seems entirely plausible that they can be just a physically inevitable. Every thought, feeling, sensory input and motor output is a physical process originating in your brain and your brain can malfunction if it's ill. And we can treat illness with medicine.

I know this road leads to SSRIs at the very least, so I always reply in the negative.The parent comment hints to me that this might be a mistake. I do not want to become accustomed to an antidepressant, so perhaps my course of action was correct.I was measured low on Vitamin D, which I've hopefully corrected, and I haven't always eaten fish regularly. Perhaps I should pay more attention to that.

Seems odd. Your doctor can't force you to take anything. If they say "do you want to try X?" just say "No". Not giving your doctor full medical context seems like a mistake - for example, maybe depression would be indicative of another issue, or maybe people who are depressed really shouldn't take a specific medication.To each their own, and perhaps you have other reasons, but this seems like a less than ideal solution to a very trivial problem if the goal is just to not take an SSRI.

She then proceeded to say "well I'll just write you the prescription anyway and you can do your research later and decide to fill it or not".I was actually shocked by this interaction, and think about it often. She's a regular family doctor with the local hospital system, and this was just a regular checkup. I answered one question with a "yes, but it's manageable and I think I can handle it with lifestyle change" and then said no twice to medication and ended up with a prescription, which I ignored but don't appreciate having on my record, since it's a false indicator for future prescribing physicians.

This is actually a somewhat difficult diagnosis to make, especially when diagnosing adult ADHD without the user documenting and bringing in a well defined log of their behavior (and possibly another person to point out things they don't know about themselves).>ADHD is a highly heterogeneous disorder with a significant comorbidity rate.Is thing that you read about in literature around it. And even more common than that is the comorbidity of all the above symptoms, that is ADHD and depression + more in autism.

Frankly, I see this as similar to telling diabetics that they should use just enough insulin to get them to learn to stop being diabetic. That's possible for a few type 2 diabetics who could make lifestyle changes that got them back into good ranges. It's completely useless for type 1 diabetics, or type 2 who can no longer go back.I'm neither diabetic nor depressed. I don't have a dog in this hunt. I'm just always astonished at “have you tried not being depressed?” Some people can “snap out of it”. Many times that number of people cannot.

There's a lot of this attitude, at least in the USA, when it comes to mental illness in general. I have ADHD, it's a common trope/meme at this point of "Have you just tried focusing?" "Gee thanks, I'm cured!"It's a form of institutional ableism, particularly prevalent in the US I think because of our hyper individualist culture. A lot of people tend to assume that you are just lazy, or not trying hard enough, as if it was just a matter of willpower.Kind of frustrating, because those same people would never walk up to someone in a wheelchair and say "have you just tried walking?" but for some reason mental illnesses get a free pass to be ableist.

When you view the creation of the US medical system with that view many of our screwed up systems make sense. A lack of willpower is a failure of man to be in touch with god, and not a problem a doctor should solve.

I don't know how rampant that problem actually is, but I don't think you should discount the impact of social stigma when it comes to mental health. It is only in the past 10 to 15 years, at least in the US, that mental health has entered the public dialogue in any meaningful sense. Historically it has been a source of massive shame with people expressing embarrassment at their loved ones suffering from mental health crises. And now we have a whole generation of influencers and politicians  who are trying to tell people to pour out all their medications, reject doctors wholesale, take their specific brand of colloidal silver, and be free.I just think this is a lot more complicated than “psychiatrists abuse the diagnosis.”

And when you question this approach, the famous lecture comes: "but diabetes patients take insulin for life. You realize depression is a real condition and need to be treated right?"

reply

Well that but also they have poorly understood long term effects even after being discontinued (in some people, not others) and they don't work for everyone. The latter is probably most of the reason they get hated on. I don't recall the source but a given antidepressant only works for something like 1/3 or less of the population. So take a person not in a great place emotionally, who is also statistically not in a great place in life overall, subject them to an insufferable bureaucratic process, give them a drug that doesn't end up working for them, add in some pretty wild side effects, sprinkle on a few long term effects that persist after they discontinue the thing that didn't work to begin with, and of course you end up with a bad reputation.The tl;dr is that our understanding of the brain and mood disorders kind of sucks.

It's actually like statins. Ideally, a doctor will recommend diet changes in addition to the pills. However, relying on lifestyle interventions almost never is effective, And the more we learn about it, the more we realize that cholesterol is mostly genetic based rather than diet based anyway. So the most effective thing they can do is say "here, take these indefinitely". And thank God they do because it saves thousands of lives annually.For many people with depression, a neurochemical imbalance is the root cause. Just like with statins, addressing it means taking some pills.

From reading internet comments you'd think so, but your experience is more typical than anything.Depression is deceptively common. As a consequence, SSRI use over a lifetime is also more common than most would assume. Any drug will come with negative side effects for some portion of its users. Multiply that by the high number of people who have ever taken an SSRI and it starts to become obvious why there are so many Internet anecdotes about SSRIs not working.Meanwhile, most people who take SSRIs successfully aren't going around and advertising the fact that they're on psychiatric medications. There is less stigma now than there was in the past, but it's still not something most people like to broadcast to the world. For patients on long term SSRIs in stable states, the SSRI is just a routine thing they take in the background and don't really think about. There's no reason for it to come up in conversation.

I have started taking SSRI after a harder-than-usual body collapse, and after no matter what I did my mood hasn't improved for a month. Regular running, meditating, writing, crafting, coding etc were my antidote to my mood swings but this time it didn't work. Started taking SSRI and continue doing all this things, and I was reborn.My therapist said that a big chunk of why i am feeling better is also because I kept doing things that are good for me. That she sees with a lot of her patients that they think a pill will magically change the situation. It doesn't work on itself, you need to show up and do things that release serotonin in your body.But seriously, unbelievable, years of frustration and friction in my life disappeared and I have never felt better.

I didn't even know I had it, but when I was diagnosed, my psychiatrist was very concerned and made a point of encouraging me to keep in touch, making sure I worked through things and engaged with the problem. I initially thought something like "I'm fine, just a little down here and there, I wonder if this person is inventing work for themselves?"Same with anxiety. I would have told you something like "I'm not an anxious person at all. I don't even know what that's like, though I can sympathize with people who suffer with it". As it turned out, I was suffering pretty severe anxiety. In retrospect it's as clear as day, but at the time it was just... The way life was.The thing is, all of my assessments remarked that I demonstrated relatively high self awareness and openness. My experience being diagnosed with ADHD and depression made me seriously concerned for people who 1) can't afford this process and support, and 2) will just continue to grind like I was, living half-dead without knowing it can be any other way.I suspect there are a ton of these people—I think I notice them quite often—and I was arguably accidentally pulled from that stupor and would likely still be there, unaware, if it weren't for a chance encounter that caused me to think slightly differently about the possibility of having ADHD.

I had a very similar experience, except it killed my libido, so I chose to endure the suffering of Winter rather than live with emotional numbness.Still, I strongly recommend it for people flirting with the abyss. It was life-changing for me while I was raising an autistic 2yo during the pandemic.

Did you, as well as the other people seconding this, have any libido left in the first place? I got on Sertraline because I was depressed, and it actually brought my libido back, by virtue of just bringing me back to a better emotional baseline.All to say, if it had affected my libido, it'd have been a NOOP anyway in my case.

When I hear people say "it killed my libido" I always think about the fact that hyper-sexuality can be a trauma response, and if your body is healing the hyper-sexuality is most likely also reduced.It's like when you have a disease and then read the side effects of a medication and notice that a lot of the side effects are basically also something that can happen when your overall condition is improving but still some people report them as adverse effects and then these are added as side effects to the package label.For example you take antibiotics but bacteria can have toxins in their body, and when the bacteria disintegrate you get more sick from the released toxins. It's called the Herxheimer effect: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarisch%E2%80%93Herxheimer_rea...When I started methyl-B12 supplementation I also had inflammation in sinuses for weeks but it was just from my immune system starting up again and being able to attack long-standing inflammation. Someone else would've put "fever", "headache" and "stuffed nose" onto the side effects medication label of methyl-B12.

Is this your trauma speaking, or do you automatically associate any sexual needs with a pathology?You've done it twice in this thread alone.

reply

The situation is PersonA has determined they need an anti-depressant. So one thing is 'wrong.' It stands to reason that they may be using sex as a painkilling mechanism. After all, sex feels great. When the anti-depressant kicks in, the body may determine it doesn't have to use that painkilling method anymore, hence, the decreased libido. It doesn't mean having a libido is bad, it means that the person potentially was overdriving it.

But I understand that it would have been better to ask and not associate because it's a fraction of the cases.

Don't take it as criticism, more of a personal take on figuring out what antidepressants do for me. Furthermore, since posting that parent comment I've converted my vit. D dose to IUs and I realised i'm only taking 800 IUs daily. So a thank you for clueing me in on that, and who knows what happens if I up that. Maybe you were right all along and all i DID need was a heroic dose of vitamin D. (... thats what she said)

About a week ago, there was a reddit post claiming it's actually geographically impossible for anyone where I live to produce enough Vitamin D naturally from the sun alone, due to the shorter days and lower angles throughout the day. I had no idea.

reply

I can't find a rigorous academic source right now, but the top web results all say we need at least UV Index 3 for our skin to be able to make enough Vitamin D. I guess summer may work for us, in the Montreal/New England area, but other than that, yeah, you and I will need to get Vitamin D from diet and/or supplements. And fish is expensive, so supplements it is.

I finally went and got diagnosed at age 46 for what had been an childhood-onset issue in retrospect. All the signs were there: inability to start work until enough challenge or novelty or a state of crisis had come about, etc. When I spoke to friends about considering treatment, they said they thought of me as a hyperfocus kind of person. But they didn't see how many support systems I had put in place to function normally, how I saw others around me just doing things while I had to work myself up to start and then keep checking and double-checking for the silly inattentive mistakes I knew from experience I would keep making.I've had a meditation practice for a long time and it has helped with anxiety but it hasn't really helped with getting started on tasks, especially those perceived as boring. I even had to psych myself up to sit down and start meditating, even though I knew I would enjoy it.I didn't know until a year or two ago that non-stimulant medication existed to treat ADHD. I always thought it was only Adderall and the like, and I couldn't risk anything that would ramp my anxiety up, or take additional treatment for the anxiety with SSRIs because I have severe hemophilia and any additional risk of bleeding from SSRIs was an untenable proposition.After sitting on the idea for some time and just hoping that I could fix it with more meditation, I finally decided to see a psychiatrist. The doctor suggested Atomoxetine, but said it doesn't work for most people and even then takes 3-4 weeks to take full effect. I started on the absurdly low dose of 10mg/day for the first month to be sure it wouldn't cause additional bleeds. By day 3 I could see a huge improvement in my working memory and ability to perform tasks. It gave me insomnia for a bit but I would wake up at 3 AM, sit down happily to work and write the best code I've written in years. I could not believe the difference it made. There were quite a few side effects initially but I was willing to put up with them because of how smoothly my brain was functioning. I became a nicer person to deal with. I felt this sense of possibility and freedom that I haven't felt since my 20s. My only regret is not having done this sooner.So yeah, please don't avoid medication based on internet reading.

More recently I was on a vacation where I took mushrooms and had a nice trip. Two days later at work I felt very relaxed driving in and sat at my desk BUT something was wrong, my head was dead quiet (the GP explained this exactly like I would.) So quiet that for a second I had a bit of panic as I thought something was wrong. Then something wonderful happened: I realized I was able to just do my work. There was no stress, no worry, no nothing. Just a calm quiet confidence to get the job done. Best day of my life.After that I called a mental health center and connected with an ADHD specialist who has been working with me. I am also on Atomoxetine myself and while it has not brought me back to that zen head space it brings me close enough. My only gripe is at a higher dose it gives me sensations in my head. However, I learned that eating a proper breakfast helps a lot as I was taking it on a near empty stomach. Overall my life has been slowly improving and I feel more confident at work.> So yeah, please don't avoid medication based on internet reading.This - 100%

I do wonder if being highly functional and feeling capable is normal though, like as a species it seems almost dysfunctional to happily plow through 8 hour workdays and bills and appointments and all the little bureaucracies we have to navigate. Sometimes a little voice screams "Run to the woods!" when I sit down and look at a long todo list for the day, but with Adderall I can generate some semblance of enjoyment from ticking off the boxes.Granted our world is what it is, and we are mostly helpless to enact large changes. Finding some kind of peace with reality is probably better than bashing your head against why you don't fit into it well.

Huge quality of life improvement. 10/10 would medicate again.

B: When people say that antidepressants saved their life, they aren't joking or exaggerating in the least.Are placebos unable to save lives?Not claiming antidepressants are or are not mostly placebo, and don't mean to minimize the pain of depression in anyway. I just don't think whether or not they saved a person's life is an indication either way. The placebo effect is real, right? As in the subject actually gets better after taking it.> Keep your pet theories to yourself if you are not a subject matter expert or someone who has experienced it first hand.This is the internet, friend. I wish you the best, but maybe don't put too much hope into that one. I think you'll have better luck cultivating the ability to be comfortable having your own beliefs while others have different (possibly wrong!) ones.

Placebo-controlled RCTs show that some people react well to antidepressants with major variation from person to person.

I'm not disputing that someone had the genuine experience of antidepressants saving their life. I'm asking if that precludes antidepressants acting as a placebo.In other words both things can be true: antidepressants saved someone's life and antidepressants can act as placebo (even in the case where they saved someone's life). And notice I'm saying "can be true". I'm not saying they are true, cause I have no idea.This is a logic question, not some kind of moral attack.

However, citalopram specifically has a big effect on the histaminegma  the sigma-1 receptor. I will focus on the sigma-1 receptor:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S134786131...Never heard of it? Yeah, don't be ashamed, it is the biggest secret in depression. In fact they are finding that many "SSRIs" are sigma-1 agonists, even prozac.https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1691987/fnins-19-...It tunrs out that Sigma receptors modulate glutamatergic dysfunction in depression, and glutamate, being excitatory, well, you can. make your assumptions from there.https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/1...It seems the main function of the Sigma-1 receptor is Calcium release. And calcium ion channels are one of the most studies ion channels in mood disorders. By increasing calcium release you increase neuronal activity, hence, the uplifted mood.It is too bad that the sigma-1 receptor is just starting to be studied and there is limited evidence of how omega-3 and Vitamin D effect it. But I do know that Vitamin D has a huge effect on SLC6A4 (SERT).https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79388-7I have Schizoaffective Disorder Bipolar Type (disabled) and have been on no less than 14 types of meds. I knwo how they work better than my psychiatrists, which I why I no longer take them. I also know my genetics which gave me clues to what is happening in my body. Now I eat a mostly seafood diet and my needs for meds has mostly vanished. I am still an odd old fellow, but at least I am not ranting in the streets or trying to kill myself anymore.Meds saved my life, but a diet high in Omega 3, D, and a bunch of other things has removed so much suffering from my life, more than any medication has.(Also, if you want to get into the weeds of depression, you might wat to look at ATP and depression https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cns.14536)

Getting on them can be a ball ache (or entirely painless; escitalopram was easy on and easy off, Wellbutrin was a nightmare to get on, but also easy off), but entirely worth a shot for anyone symptomatic.

Yes, you did. Had the same medication and got tremors and stiffness so bad I thought I had early-onset Parkinson. Could hardly unlock the door without dropping the keys five or six times. Fortunately, it ceased when I stopped the SSRI.

Me and my brother just can't stop mixing English and German when we talk to each other. But we don't or barely do it when we talk to others.When I learned about code, logic, math, I started talking and thinking in different ways and from different and towards different perspectives.The more I read, which I haven't done in a long long while, the more massive and vast the info I pack into a few sentences becomes.The more I draw or play the guitar or work on game mechanics and story design or  dialogues, the more annoying my speech and manners become but to my environment, that also means that I become "more" social and actually somewhat likeable and bearable.You smell like Non-evidence based arrogance. I was always surrounded by people who smelled like that. But they are good little copypasta soldiers who follow trends and mutually assure that they don't go completely off the rails. But if one does, they leave him on his real or imaginary battlefield. Nobody wants to evolve anymore. It hurts some people just a little too much, I guess. They'd rather poison others and have their code deleted before getting to live a second life. I hope I could get you on edge a little. I'm just fucking around.

"Do not rely too much on your own judgment. [...] if you are an expert user of LLMs and you tag 10 pages as being AI-generated, you've probably falsely accused one editor."Never accuse people of LLM writing based on short comments, your false positive rate is invariably going to be way too high to be acceptable given the very limited material.It's just not worth it: Even if you correctly accuse 9/10 times, you are being toxic to that false positive case for basically no gain.

Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor, but saw 4 seasons of dr. House. Moreover, few hours of Huberman Lab on sleep and light and most importantly, this episode of Additude Mag Podcast on curing SAD and ADHD day-rhytm shifting with light glasses: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu4mLgkNc6IWhat happens in the seasonal affective disorder season is the sunlight pattern diverges from 6-18 that we evolved with. Without daily reminder of getting enough sun (or sun-like) light at the 6 o'clock⁰, your body clock will drift.It can start by feeling groggy instead of refreshed in the morning, even if you've slept enough. And can escalate into loosing the will to do anything or even live.No wonder. You're still an animal. You need to be fed, put to bed, etc. at a specific time. If you try to make your body sleep during the day, and eat and work during what body expects to be night, you won't really sleep and won't really live/work. Enough of not really sleeping and not really living - you mess up your body, your gut biome, your hormonal balance and your brain chemistry. You kind of should get depressed when you do it.You can steer your body clock with light. Most of us do it, by exposing ourselves to strong (strong enough it won't matter if it includes blue wavelength or not).But you can do it consciously (and in a way good for you) by putting on light therapy glasses (I'm using Lumiere 3¹, and they are not the only ones, find your own) at 6⁰ everyday, or right after you wake up if you're trying to readjust your rhythm. Or if you have time and want to save $200, use a stationary lamp and just sit in front of it doing nothing. I don't have the time. When readjusting, small doses of melatonin (0.5mg) 1h before sleep will accelerate body clock shift.But don't listen to me, if you have SAD, you should really listen to that ADHD experts episode.I feel for you, struggling with that stuff for a long time.

In many countries it is physically impossible to get enough vitamin D from the sun, even if you go out naked.Also did you ever notice that the cheap apartments in many places are facing north and do not have a balcony, and of course do not have a private garden? Now you are reduced to going to a park which in the "cheap" areas is also not a good spot to chill for 30 minutes.

For D3, it is 25mcg / 1000 IU / 125%After splitting in half it's 12.5 mcg / 500 IU / 62.5%.I take with some fat-containing food to allow ir to absorb which is usually breakfast (yogurt, some nuts, some kind of fruit, oats), and it's a night and day difference in my mood (how easily I can control my temper if already agitated, how easily I brush off annoying stuff, takes the intensity off of my reactions and mood during conversations).I did a blood test before starting, and if normal is between 30 - 70, I was at 10. Dr prescribed megadose of D2, followed by daily D3, but I skipped on the megadose and went straight to D3 -- makes me wonder if a megadose would build up my stores since D is fat-soluble and make it so I could miss a day and not notice.All of the above is anecdotal from me, a self-professed cave dweller, but it's been a couple of years now, and I still notice the difference. Also, what I heard from people in Boston is that 90% of them are on a vitamin D supplement. My friend from there laughed at me when I was raving about it, saying "yeah, literally everyone here is on it".

Edit: for clarity I am not saying it is impossible to overdose on oral tablets, but rather that with most tablets 400 IU to 1000 IU and the safe limit so much higher than these, it seems like it would be extremely unlikely for someone to be taking 30+ tablets daily. Not impossible, but not easy either.

reply

First: the RDA and the safety limit are not the same, and an RDA in a country being too low does not mean that the maximum safe dose is wrong.And it certainly does not mean that there is a higher risk in under-dosing than overdosing when taking the RDA (which already includes recommendations for supplementing if you spend most of your time indoors).I'm not a scientist, so I only know what physicians told me and what's explained in news publications or by consumer advocacy non-profits.Here are a study (which I didn't read) and the NHS's advise on Vitamin D toxicity:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557876/https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-...The study says:> Most cases of vitamin D toxicity resolve without serious complications or sequelae. However, in some instances, severe hypercalcemia can lead to acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Cases of permanent renal damage due to vitamin D toxicity are rare.Which sounds good, but I don't think it supports that there is no risk of oral Vitamin D overdose.

* Toxicity resulting from lack of monitoring is frequently seen in patients requiring high doses to treat ailments like osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, psoriasis, gastric bypass surgery, celiac, or inflammatory bowel disease.* Patients who are on high doses of Vitamin D and taking inadvertently increased amounts of highly fortified milk are also at increased risk for vitamin D toxicity.* According to the latest report from America's Poison Centers (APC), there were 11,718 cases of vitamin D exposure recorded in the National Poison Data System. More than half of these cases were in children younger than 5 years.* The clinical signs and symptoms of vitamin D toxicity manifest from hypercalcemia's effects.* Clinical management of vitamin D toxicity is mainly supportive and focuses on lowering calcium levels.* Isotonic saline should be used to correct dehydration and increase renal calcium clearance.A lot of those point to people drinking too much milk! (enriched milk)* People with osteoporosis thinking "I better drink more milk for strong bones" when they are already on supplements/medicine.* Kids drinking lots of milk and presumably not drinking any water - hence the dehydration.PS: There are a lot of people out there that don't drink any water, and stick to juice or milk or soda, etc. They are not always fat, but that doesn't mean they don't have issues.

And my takeaway is not that everyone should be taking 10k IE, but it's a great reminder to be more consistent in taking my Vitamin capsules in winter.I'm still standing by my point that it's "easy" to overdose on Vitamin D. Like the article already mentions, one should remember possible kidney issues and not take insane doses of it.What the recommended daily intake should be, I don't know.The whole reason I'm commenting on this is I used to take one of the "top" antidepressants on this list.And I am a skeptic of antidepressants, that doesn't mean I deny all positive effects in people who are prescribed them, of course.For what it's worth, it's also easy to overdose on Venlafaxine. It's still considered safe.Just an example to make clear that my comment was not a critique of taking Vitamin D in general.I don't find the article's main point surprising though. That's the reason I'm taking Vitamin D, too. Doesn't mean that it's impossible to overdose, and this point is also important, because many people still think that it would be impossible to take too much of an vitamin or mineral. Thankfully, high-dose Vitamin A / retinol supplements are not as widespread.

But also here is something to think about: your body will produce more D3 than that by being in the sun for just several minutes. So if you consider such a low dose of D3 an overdose then you better steer clear of the sun!

reply

This is another superficial statement, that displays shallow-at-best understanding. Staying in the sun and producing via the skin, and intake via food are 2 separate pathways. You cannot just make wild assumptions about one of those pathways from stuff you know about the other pathway.And actually: Yes, you shouldn't stay in the sun for too long without proper protection. Having the sun shine on your skin is not some inherently healthy thing. It too comes with acceptable dosage and overdose. Symptoms of overdose are commonly known as getting a sunburn.

If you are not an expert in the matter of the paper, you might not realize some side condition, that makes some statement or result of the paper irrelevant for your individual situation.

Just a simple look at the side effects of high dosages:Safety and side effectsTaken in typical doses, vitamin D is thought to be mainly safe.But taking too much vitamin D in the form of supplements can be harmful and even deadly. Taking more than 4,000 IU a day of vitamin D might cause:    Upset stomach and vomiting.
    Weight loss and not wanting to eat.
    Muscle weakness.
    Not being able to think clearly or quickly.
    Heart rhythm issues.
    Kidney stones and kidney damage.

> McCullough et al 2019 gave over thousands of patients 5,000 to 10,000 IU/day, for seven years, and there were zero cases of serious side effects. This is in line with Billington et al 2020, a 3-year-long double-blinded randomized controlled trial, where they found "the safety profile of vitamin D supplementation is similar for doses of 400, 4000, and 10,000 IU/day." (though "mild hypercalcemia" increased from 3% to 9%. IMHO, that's a small cost for reducing the risk of major depression & suicide.)So why then does Mayoclinic, etc, all say 4000 IU is the limit? I think because policy is decades behind science (this happened with trans fats), and also policymakers are much more risk-averse. (this is why in California, thanks to Prop 65, up until ~2018, there used to be a warning in every coffeehouse that coffee causes cancer.)But thanks to your comment, I will edit the intro to note what the official max safe dose is, and that more recent peer-reviewed research shows it's too low!

1) There are lots of studies that correlate Vitamin D production with sunlight exposure. For example, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20398766/ this one lands on 1/4 of a MED = 1000 IU. Of course now we have a MED definition problem, but we're roughly talking single digit numbers for a white person in midday sun in NYC to reach 1/4 of a MED.2) If you also supplement with Magnesium, a lot of your side effects go away. Vitamin D3 depletes Magnesium absorption.

I did have one issue related to magnesium however.  If I did a very high dose of magnesium taurate and a couple of other chelated forms I would have trouble catching my breath after physical exertion similar to chronic high doses of iodine.

Fortunately today's vegan communities are much more aware of this so I started taking these supplements right up front and all my blood markers improved dramatically since when I consumed meat/dairy.It's annoying to hear some push back against this when it's as simple as taking relatively safe supplements (just make sure you talk to a doctor, and not a social media influencer, about how much you should take, and if you get a chance to regularly check your bloodwork don't miss out).

from https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-maga... :  Eating ground flax seeds gives you more benefits than whole seeds, as whole seeds remain undigested and pass through the system.

from https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/must-you-grind-flax...  Most people can't chew flaxseeds effectively, so they grind them first or swallow them whole. (They are tiny.) Nutrition experts do recommend grinding them first to release the fiber and the beneficial fatty acids. Flaxseeds are helpful for constipation and may lower cholesterol as well.

  Ground flaxseed goes rancid easily, however, so it should be kept in the freezer until you are ready to use it. If you buy it ground, you wouldn't have to use the blender or coffee grinder to break those seeds up before you have breakfast.

On a sidenote, I know that knowing that it is "just your depression talking" is also a pretty hard pill to swallow and not always helpful. Personally I have a lot of fears that I know are irrational but that doesn't make them any less real.And even if your problems are external, sometimes you need to focus and your inner self first, find some strength and help so you can tackle the external problems later. But for other people "working on yourself" can be avoiding the actual problems they need to work on.And yes happiness is always relative.

We tell ourselves that we must have "better lives" than say a native american in the year 1000AD, but there's no reason to think that.I think odds are that maybe the native american was happier -- having a small group that you spend time with outdoors every day, getting extensive exercise, having a clear sense of purpose, eating healthy fresh food every day, never once thinking about politics or bills or global warming. I bet they liked their life more than a depressed divorced accountant in our modern society, even if we have more material wealth or health access.

The problem with this that to a bad situation different people react differently - some trying to do what they can to improve the situation or at least don't make it worse and some give up and let situation to slip and become worse and worse (becoming a self fulfilling prophesy). It's not a choose one makes I think (it's likely a biological predisposition) but the difference is still exists.People prone to depression genuinely believe the main (only) reason for a depression that the life sucks and as a result they avoid medical help and don't do anything which could help them.

And each of those things can be caused by physiological issues as well. You might feel stressed because you don't sleep well. You might sleep poorly because you suffer from e.g. sleep Apnea. Which in turn might be because of a mix of physiological and other reasons (diet, weight, alcohol abuse, etc.).Or you might be working too hard, which makes you stressed and causes you to lose a lot of sleep. Different causes that have similar results. Including long term physiological results. Your brain can actually get damaged if you chronically abuse it or neglect it. Many "between the ears" type problems are actually physiological.Root causing your issues enables you to deal with them properly instead of fighting the symptoms.Anyway, I take vitamin D and a few other things. Getting yourself checked out regularly once you hit middle age is a good idea. There's a lot of stuff that is long term lethal that a checkup can detect early. And some of it is fixable. I have the usual cardio vascular challenges that many people struggle with because of a combination of genetics, age, and life style. And indeed a vitamin D deficit.I was also recommended to consume more omega-3 as well. Eat salmon. Work some flax/chia seeds in your breakfast. I put flax seeds in my yogurt and use it as a thickener in sauces as well. You have to grind it to dust for it to get absorbed properly. Dirt cheap and it doesn't mess with flavor/texture too much. I keep a jar of ground flax seeds in my fridge. Takes 2 minutes to top it up every 1-2 weeks or so with some freshly ground seeds.But I'm also aware that me being a stressed startup founder has health consequences that a few pills and suplements won't fix for me. I need to actively make sure I get my rest and sleep. I deal a lot better with stressful situations when I'm well rested. And I seem to be better at avoiding getting in to those as well. And I feel happier. Sometimes the best thing I can do for my company is having a proper weekend or going to bed early enough that I can get my 8 hours of sleep. You can survive on 4 hours (been there done that), for a while. But most people are not at their peak performance if they do that.

Pinpointing problems in your life as the cause of your depression is a trap.

reply

For example: if your life objectively sucks, why aren't you doing anything about it? Some people whose lives suck fix their lives, and other people get depressed and do nothing; what's the difference? And: all of us know somebody who appears to have a good life and therefore their depression is presumably a chemical imbalance thing but if you're being honest the vibes in their life are a bit off, actually, like you can tell they're not really getting everything they need out of it, that they're clearly good at masking (for example people who are clearly not thriving in their relationships) .... in which case sure medication could help but you can't shake the feeling that facing the reality of their life would help a lot more.However! Questioning this stuff becomes a bit of a moral minefield. "Believing" in the chemical imbalance theory is part of why it's medically helpful. If your life has sucked for years and you could find no way of fixing it and then SSRIs helped, then you basically need to believe that it really was a chemical imbalance, because believing that it might not be threatens to take away the thing that's making your life work. So much so that I would bet at this point there are already readers of this comment who are ready to angrily reply to my preceding paragraphs, because the model I just described threatens their existence. (If so, wait a sec and read the rest...)On the flip side, for some people not believing in the chemical imbalance model for some particular case might be important. Maybe they want to feel responsible for their life being bad, so they will be motivated to do something about it, and being happy due to drugs would make them feel complacent and okay with years passing by at a shitty job or something. Or picture someone whose parent has gone their whole life unable to take them seriously as an adult, which as a result means the child and parent have a bad relationship, and then picture the parent complaining about depression and taking medication for it. This can be really infuriating: the child thinks about the parent, "your life sucks because of the tension created by not treating people around you with respect, and you're so incapable of recognizing this even when it's told to your face regularly that you're taking drugs to feel better despite not fixing the problem". Now ascribing depression to medical problems seems like avoidance, and having people write off your frustrations and say that you're just depressed and need to take a drug for it is frustrating.Just saying: the two narratives really get tangled up. I don't really know what to do about it, but I do think that some harm is done by harping on the concept of a "chemical imbalance". A lot of the issue is avoided if you just think of the drugs as helpful but don't choose any model (with its moral implications) for what exactly it is they're helping with. Just treat them as a tool for making you feel better.Also, I suspect that people who have an intuitive aversion to mental health drugs are probably way overindexing on that intuition. I definitely did this for a long time, as did some friends I knew growing up. Turns out whatever your issues you can sometimes just deal with them sooner than later if you accept that doctors might be onto something. (Actually I think the reason people get stuck avoiding medication for so long is precisely that they feel like they're not allowed to be skeptical of them... which makes them kinda plant their feet in the ground and refuse to be open to it. That's kinda why I'm typing this long comment, to tell anyone reading that it is a reasonable thing to feel. And now that you know that maybe try them anyway..?)

I know first-hand that low energy-levels and lacking energy production mechanically lead to depression.Also, look at how people (children also) experience the world and their relationships and their stresses when they are tired (or even just hungry) compared to when they are fit...Fix those, and the depression might be gone.This is not bashing against anti-depressants, they play their role to. But in some cases, energy-management is key.

The technical details are beyond my understanding but I've heard from a PhD in the field that Masterjohn's understanding of metabolism is second to none. Whether his protocols work or not is certainly a case by case matter (like any health protocol), but he always appears to substantiate it with well-cited lines of argument, and is willing to engage with interlocutors.As for spending years with changing protocols without getting anywhere besides spending lots of money, well that can be said for people with complex issues who go the institutionally approved route as well. It isn't discrediting in its own right that a protocol didn't work for some.

If you (or your close ones) don't suffer from depression, then I guess it's best to ignore it until scientific consensus has formed. That will for sure show up on wikipedia. As far as I can see as a layperson there is a lot of correlation with Vitamin D that breaks down in interventions and Vitamin D is recommended mostly for babies and elderly people. On the other hand I see Vitamin D pushed as a miracle drug not unlike Vitamin C used to some decades ago and regular reports of overdosing of supplements leading to organ failure.If you're suffering from depression, you should talk to your doctor. They will be able to help you to weigh potential benefits with risks

reply

Those are two different things. Cutting out caffeine can help with anxiety but not ADHD. It's the opposite for ADHD, stimulates help significantly.

reply

Also there's a growing trend of diagnosing every focus problem as ADHD when many patients might have focus problems secondary to another condition like anxiety. It's sadly all too common to find someone who believes they have ADHD due to TikTok self diagnosis or even a lazy doctor's diagnosis but their core problem is actually anxiety. For these people, stimulants of any kind can actually worsen focus even if then provide a short term perception of helping due to the energy boost.

I'm quite sensitive to caffeine, yet I can drink green tea all day without noticing much effect, while even a light coffee or a caffeine pill is clearly noticeable. I can also drink tea before going to sleep without any problems.

You can absolutely get high doses of caffeine from tea if you really want to. It comes down to the type of tea, how much is used, and how strong it's brewed.There is nothing special about tea that breaks the rules of caffeine. It comes down to the content of the leaves, quantity, and extraction into water.> while even a light coffee or a caffeine pill is clearly noticeableCaffeine pills generally have really high dosages, FYI. Even light coffee drinkers can be caught off guard by how much caffeine is in a typical off the shelf caffeine pill.

There's definitely something special, just poorly studied: typical "how much caffeine is in X?" tables show tea having caffeine levels similar to coffee, but I never feel the same effects.> Caffeine pills generally have really high dosages, FYI.I use 200 mg tablets split into quarters for doses of 50–100 mg. Yet, they produce a much milder curve than coffee (which I no longer drink) and, as a side effect, cause no gastrointestinal side effects!

I have never seen a caffeine comparison table that shows tea and coffee at the same level.It's common knowledge that typical coffee brews are in the range of 2-5X higher in caffeine content than typical tea brews.Tea is widely used as a lower caffeine alternative to coffee.

I briefly quit caffeine once but it as well before any realization of anxiety. So, hard to extrapolate forward from that experience.What feels different to me (compared to you) is this: sometimes I'll drink 2 cups of coffee in the morning and be awake but useless. Sometimes totally productive. Caffeine in some form is there - recently sometimes substituting coffee for a Celsius.

I'm usually able to reason or force my way through depression and the like, but have had a few deep bouts in my life.  The medications have ranged from ineffective to building a tolerance quickly, to just plain worse than the symptoms being treated.  Nothing like missing your highway exit multiple times back and forth because you get lost "in" the drive on medication, or having 140 browser tabs open and losing 5 hours of work time.Everyone is different.  I am amazed at how much western society has so many hormonal issues that come down to the lack of quality or appropriate fatty acid intake and a lack of something as simple as more outdoor/sun time.  I think the "low fat/cholesterol" advice for most of the past half century combined with the increase in snacking and junk foods have been massive disservices to humanity as a whole.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the effects are multi-generational in the making either.

recent evidence [0] suggests there's not much of a link between serotonin and depression, and therefore the effects of SSRIs are either placebo or an as of yet unexplained mechanism of action.

This curio bothered me as well. I didn't yet get a fully satisfying explanation for this either.There's this diagram, showing for example the full pathway of how linoleic acid catabolizes: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Linoleic_acid_beta_o...It shows dependencies of the process onto several very specific molecular machines we call enzymes.(main pathway, handling saturated fatty acids)   ° Acyl CoA dehydrogenase -- removes 2 hydrogens from carbons immediately after the carboxylic head, forming a π-bond (double-bond) between the α-β carbons;
   ° Enoyl CoA hydratase -- adds water as H-OH to that α-β carbons π-bond;
   ° 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase -- converts the added -OH hydroxyl group to =O keto group;
   ° β-ketothiolase -- grabs the two keto groups, and snips off 2 carbons from the chain, carrying them off in bound form as a molecule of acyl-CoA;

(unsaturated side-branch)   ° Dienoyl CoA reductase -- collapses two neighboring π-bonds into one;
   ° Enoyl CoA isomerase -- converts cis- to trans- variants, making them compatible with Enoyl CoA hydratase. Pathway continues from there.

These, when viewed as a set of combinators, seem perfectly sufficient to metabolize any fatty acid chain. Their chemistry reads pretty straightforward — and it must deal with cis/trans isomerism shenanigans, with neighboring π-bonds, with odd/even parity of the carbon chain. But it apparently handles all that!Besides catalysis (combustion of the acids for energy), the two other paths for consumed fatty acids are excretion, and laying them into cell walls and membranes. These two paths aren't selective; they mostly don't care about the length of the chain, and where which π-bonds occur in it, if any.So this must imply, that the "quirk of evolution" lives somewhere on the anabolic  (synthesis/production) side of fatty acids; definitely not on the catabolic side.

But it apparently handles all that!Besides catalysis (combustion of the acids for energy), the two other paths for consumed fatty acids are excretion, and laying them into cell walls and membranes. These two paths aren't selective; they mostly don't care about the length of the chain, and where which π-bonds occur in it, if any.So this must imply, that the "quirk of evolution" lives somewhere on the anabolic  (synthesis/production) side of fatty acids; definitely not on the catabolic side.

   ° Dienoyl CoA reductase -- collapses two neighboring π-bonds into one;
   ° Enoyl CoA isomerase -- converts cis- to trans- variants, making them compatible with Enoyl CoA hydratase. Pathway continues from there.

Within my peer group of people on the spectrum (which very often comes with a depression, which is logical) we've discussed Vitamin D studies for years. And multiple of us decided to give it a try for a couple of months. And neither those who tried it INSTEAD of an SSRI, nor those that took both (SSRI + D) could report any measurable difference.I have a theory on why is that: It is known that low levels of Vitamin D is one likely cause for depression - in Northern Europe, where during winter time people do not get enough sunlight, that correlates very clearly with the suffering of depression.But potentially it simply does not work the other way round: I moved to near the equator, and I therefore basically have sunlight shining out of my butt, but still am depressed. It makes sense that in this case Vitamin D makes no difference at all.In summary my theory would be: Vitamin D only has an effect on a depression that was caused by a lack of Vitamin D.

The main problem with ALA is that to have the good effects attributed to omega-3s, it must be converted by a limited supply of enzymes into EPA and DHA. As a result, only a small fraction of it has omega-3's effects — 10%–15%, maybe less. The remaining 85%–90% gets burned up as energy or metabolized in other ways. So in terms of omega-3 "power," a tablespoon of flaxseed oil is worth about 700 milligrams (mg) of EPA and DHA. That's still more than the 300 mg of EPA and DHA in many 1-gram fish oil capsules, but far less than what the 7 grams listed on the label might imply.https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-not-flaxseed...Also, beware of omega 6 fats. Seed oils (corn, soy, canola) used in commercial food products are incredibly omega 6 dominant in terms of polyunsaturated fat content. Consequently, the ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 fats we consume has plummeted as food production has industrialized. Omega 3 fats are precursors to generally anti-inflammatory signaling compounds, whereas omega 6 fats are precursors to pro-inflammatory signaling compounds. The bias in fat intake leads to more pro-inflammatory signaling in the body, and a lot of alt health types have alleged this is a major causative factor in the obesity epidemic.This is important for depression, because chronic brain inflammation as a cause of depression was one of the going hypotheses at least a decade ago when I last looked into all of this. Upping omega 3 intake is an intervention that can address chronic inflammation, which is potentially why it improves some cases of depression.Pretty much nobody in the west needs more omega 6s these days. I hear even farmed salmon eat primarily corn and soy based feeds these days, meaning their fat ratio is skewed much more heavily toward omega 6 than wild salmon and fish.

First, when taking omega 3 supplements, you generally care about increasing the ratio of omega 3 to omega 6. Hemp hearts have much more omega 6 than omega 3, so they're not very effective for improving the ratio.Second, hemp hearts contain ALA, while what you generally want to improve is EPA and DHA (this is also covered in TFA). The body can convert ALA to EPA and DHA, but it's not efficient.So all in all, if Omega 3 for the article's stated benefits is what you want, this is not the way. I recommend looking into eating more fish, or if you want a vegan route, algae-based supplements. [0] is a decent source from the NIH about foods and their Omega 3 content, split by ALA/EPA/DHA.[0]: https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthPro...

Do be aware that not all vitamin E supplements actually contain the dosage that they are labeled at, and that inclues both no-name brands and some big name brands.  I'm having trouble finding a good reference on google due to AI and SEO pollution.  But I recall Nature Made was labelled accurately and that is what I buy.My wife on the other hand has struggled with life-long anxiety/depression even when living in Atlanta.  For her a fairly low dose of lexapro enables her to live her life like a normal person.  We wish we could get her mother to give it a shot for a few weeks, as she now can see a lot of similarities in both their personality traits that were affected by a life of untreated anxiety.We also have cat that would probably have been put down for fear-biting of people and attacking our mild and mellow dog until we got his aggression under control with kitty prozac.  I kid you not, it's a transdermal fluoxetine cream we put in his ear each day.  Without the constant anxiety stimulus in the way, his real personality came through and he is actually very sweet.  To me at least.  Still bites my wife, but not hard anymore, just enough to keep her alert.

Too much Vitamin D3 can be toxic, so doctors are reluctant to tell you to go over published guidelines.  but if you don't have other issues, and stick to what you can get OTC from a normal vitamin brand and follow the instructions, you're probably safe.  There was a story a while ago about a woman who died from too much D3, but it turned out she was taking a whole bottle's worth every day for years.

Taking 10K per day is a bad idea. I went into the excess Vitamin D range with half that dose even in winter with an indoor job.More is not always better.

That's not what I was doing in my other comments that you replied to. If you have a knot, and imagine all the possible things you can do with your hands and body and tools in the universe and notice that to a first approximation none of them will untie the knot. Not hitting it with a spoon, not stroking your chin, not jazz hands, way more than 99.999% of possible movements will not untie it. Some of the things which won't work also include pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, "not being weak", "toughing it out". "just get over it". All those are no more effective than any other of the 99.999...% of things which won't work.The things which will work are in a tiny space of things involving fingernails, needles, knot-eye-hand-feedback-loop and some understanding of rope and tangles. Or fire.Just because fire will have a useful effect doesn't mean the knot is caused by an imbalance of fire and so you should keep burning your fingers for the rest of your life as "the cure" for knots. The way to untangle a knot is to develop the focused, pointed, targeted skills of untangling knots. And (I argue) the way to untangle negative thoughts is not by powering through them, toughing them out, positive mental attitude, fortitude, being strong, manifestation, dreaming big, just getting over it, or crowbarring your mood up with sledgehammer drugs to an 80-billion neuron network for the rest of your life, or anything else of the millions of other concepts one could do or imagine doing - except the focused, pointed, feedback-loop skills of untangling negative thoughts wielded by a particularly good therapist or by yourself.Whether you develop such a thing by therapy training, meditation, prayer, Stoicism, biofeedback systems, luck, intuition... I suspect there are multiple ways which are effective that can be developed through multiple approaches, but not many. And "I tried thinking my bad thoughts away and it didn't work so it must be genetic" is not one of them.

Ethos Technologies, a San Francisco-based provider of software for selling life insurance, debuted on the Nasdaq on Thursday. As one of the year's first major tech IPOs, the insurtech platform is being closely watched as a bellwether for the 2026 listing cycle.

The company and its selling shareholders raised approximately $200 million in the offering, selling 10.5 million shares at $19 each under the ticker symbol “LIFE” — one of the more on-the-nose choices in recent memory. The name fits. Ethos runs a three-sided platform where consumers buy policies online in 10 minutes without medical exams. It says over 10,000 independent agents use its software to sell those policies and that carriers like Legal & General America and John Hancock rely on it for underwriting and administrative services. Ethos itself isn't an insurer — it's a licensed agency earning commissions on sales.

Though the company's stock closed its first day as a public company at $16.85, 11% below its IPO price of $19, Ethos co-founders Peter Colis and Lingke Wang still have plenty to celebrate, having grown the 10-year-old business to public-market scale.

“When we launched [the business], there were like eight or nine other life insurtech startups that looked very similar to Ethos, with similar Series A funding,” Colis told TechCrunch. “Over time, the vast majority of those startups have pivoted, been acquired at subscale, remain at subscale or gone out of business.”

For instance, Policygenius, which raised over $250 million from investors, including KKR and Norwest Venture Partners, was acquired by PE-backed Zinnia in 2023. Meanwhile, Health IQ, a startup that secured more than $200 million from prominent VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, filed for bankruptcy that same year.

Ethos, which has raised over $400 million in venture capital, could have easily succumbed to a similar fate. Instead, the company remained laser-focused on reaching profitability as the era of cheap capital and easy fundraising came to an end in 2022. “Not knowing what the ongoing funding climate would be, we got really serious about ensuring profitability,” Colis said.

That financial discipline transformed it into a profitable company by mid-2023, according to its IPO documents. Since then, Ethos has also maintained a year-over-year revenue growth rate of more than 50%. In the nine months ending September 30, 2025, the company generated almost $278 million in revenue and just under $46.6 million in net income.

Still, the company ended its first day as a public company with a market capitalization of about $1.1 billion, a valuation that's significantly below the $2.7 billion it garnered in its last private round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 in July 2021.

When asked why Ethos went public, Colis said that a big part of the reason was to bring “additional trust and credibility” to potential partners and clients. He explained that because many major insurance carriers are over a century old, being publicly traded signals the company's staying power.

The largest outside shareholders of Ethos include prominent firms, including Sequoia, Accel, Google's venture arm GV, and SoftBank, as well as General Catalyst and Heroic Ventures. Sequoia and Accel did not sell shares in the IPO, the company disclosed.

Electronic cigarettes - or vapes - can release puffs of vapor in aromatic clouds. The health risks of breathing in this secondhand or passive vapor aren't fully understood. So, researchers reporting in ACS' Environmental Science & Technology conducted a preliminary study on lingering vape plumes in indoor environments. They found that aged vapor contained fine particles with several metals and highly reactive compounds, which together produce radicals that might damage lung tissue if inhaled.

Our study reveals that the chemical cocktail of metal nanoparticles and reactive peroxides in aged e-cigarette aerosols creates a unique profile of respiratory health risks, highlighting that secondhand vapor is something by-standers shouldn't have to breathe."

Ying-Hsuan Lin, corresponding author of the study, University of California, Riverside

Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes don't create smoke; they create vapors that could expose non-users to harmful substances. Early studies showed that these secondhand vape aerosols contain volatile organic compounds that react with indoor ozone, creating new compounds, such as peroxides. Additionally, vape liquids and puffs commonly contain heavy metals, as well as other metals that could easily react with peroxides to produce potentially damaging compounds like free radicals.

In another step toward understanding the potential health effects of secondhand vape plumes, Lin and colleagues examined how ozone indoors impacts the metal and peroxide composition of vape aerosols. They also wanted to see what happens when these substances react in wet environments, simulating what might happen inside the lungs.

For their experiments, the researchers created a simplified vape liquid with one flavoring ingredient (a floral-smelling terpene) and no nicotine, loaded it into two different vape pens with refillable cartridges, and puffed it into a chamber with ozone in the air. After 90 minutes, they collected the aged aerosols for analysis. The particles from both pens contained iron, aluminum and zinc ions, as well as trace amounts of heavy metals such as lead, arsenic and tin. And the two sets of aged aerosols had similar levels of peroxides. The smallest particles, classified as ultrafine particles, contained higher percentages of metals and peroxide compounds compared to larger aerosols.

To preliminarily understand how aged aerosols react with lung fluids, the researchers placed the samples in a water-based solution. The aged aerosols created radicals with the ultrafine particles producing 100 times more radicals relative to their weight as compared to larger particles. Because ultrafine particles can get deep into humans' lungs and enter the sensitive, fluid-lined alveoli, the researchers say the results indicate these particles' potential to damage lung tissues and lower respiratory function.

The researchers acknowledge that the study was done under controlled laboratory conditions, and more research is needed using real-world indoor environments and commercially available e-cigarette liquids. Regardless, these results suggest that repeated exposure to aged vape plumes could negatively impact lung health, especially for individuals with pre-existing lung conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, commonly referred to as COPD.

The class of anti-inflammatory drugs known as TNF-inhibitors has brought relief to many sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis, but they don't work for up to 4 of every 10 patients.

New research led by Washington State University may have discovered why: a "backdoor" pathway of inflammation that sidesteps medicines that lock the front door.

The findings, published in the journal Cellular & Molecular Immunology, suggest new avenues for improving the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, a debilitating autoimmune disease where the body attacks its own joints. The disease affects roughly 1% of the world's population, and the discovery could have positive implications for rheumatoid arthritis as well as other autoimmune diseases.

The research team found that a lesser-known inflammatory signal triggered by proteins known as TWEAK and Fn14 play an important role in the inflammatory response. The main protein involved in arthritis is Tumor Necrosis Factor, or TNF; over the past quarter-century, a range of biologic drugs known as TNF inhibitors, which block signaling in that pathway, have come onto the market.

The new study found that TWEAK and Fn14 signaling team up with TNF to amplify inflammation. When both signals are active, inflammation surges. When the Fn14 receptor-mediated pathway is blocked, that TNF-driven surge quiets dramatically. 

It's kind of like a back-door entry or an alternate route. If you shut the main door for TNF, it has other ways to cause inflammation."

 Salah-uddin Ahmed, professor and associate dean for research and graduate education, College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and corresponding author of the new publication

The discovery could herald good news for the millions of people afflicted by rheumatoid arthritis worldwide. Many of those patients have gotten effective relief from the five TNF inhibitors that have been approved by the FDA, a class of drugs that has grown rapidly since their introduction.

They are also prescribed for conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and others. It is estimated that the market for the drugs in 2024 was about $25 billion.

"These are fantastic for the majority of patients, but roughly 30% to 40% of patients don't respond," Ahmed said.

Also, among those who do respond, some will see the effectiveness of the drugs decline.

The new publication grows from several years of research led by a former graduate student in Ahmed's lab, Farheen Shaikh, who was the first author on the paper. The researchers wanted to explore the biological reasons that TNF inhibitors aren't always effective; it was known that TWEAK was a part of the large protein superfamily of TNF-an evolutionarily related group of proteins with a common ancestor-but the relationship between them was not well-understood.

The team examined human tissues, as well as data from rat studies, to explore the molecular communications involved in the inflammatory process. They discovered that TWEAK can exploit its own protein receptor-Fn14-to cause inflammation.

"What we found was when you block Fn14 or knock down Fn14, the power of TNF to cause inflammation was reduced significantly," Ahmed said. "This was telling us TNF heavily relied on this receptor to cause inflammation."

This "crosstalk" between TNF and Fn14-the alternate route for inflammation-was first described in the new publication.

Ahmed now plans to investigate a couple of different pathways for developing potential therapeutics - one would target the two inflammatory pathways together, and the other would focus on the Fn14 path. Given the role of TNF in other autoimmune diseases, further study of the Fn14 function could shine a light on other illnesses, as well, he said. 

"This is almost like a partner in crime for TNF," he said.

A preclinical study published in Nature has found evidence that the hippocampus, the brain region that stores memory, also reorganizes memories to anticipate future outcomes.

The findings, from researchers at the Brandon Lab at McGill University and their collaborators at Harvard University, reveal a learning process that had not been directly observed before.

"The hippocampus is often described as the brain's internal model of the world," said senior author Mark Brandon, Associate Professor in McGill's Department of Psychiatry and Researcher at the Douglas Research Centre. "What we are seeing is that this model is not static; it is updated day by day as the brain learns from prediction errors. As outcomes become expected, hippocampal neurons start to respond earlier as they learn what will happen next."

The hippocampus builds maps of physical space and past experiences that help us make sense of the world. Scientists have known these maps change over time as brain activity patterns shift, a phenomenon that is currently assumed to be random.

The new findings demonstrate the changes are not random, but structured. Researchers obtained these findings by tracking brain activity in mice as the mice learned a task with a predictable reward.

What we found was surprising. Neural activity that initially peaked at the reward gradually shifted to earlier moments, eventually appearing before mice reached the reward."

Mark Brandon, Associate Professor, McGill's Department of Psychiatry 

Rather than relying on traditional electrodes, which can only track neurons for short periods, the researchers used new imaging techniques that cause active neurons to glow. The Brandon Lab is among the first in Canada to use this technology, enabling the team to follow cells over several weeks and track slow changes that traditional methods often miss.

Simpler forms of reward learning have long been associated with more primitive brain circuits, as famously demonstrated by Ivan Pavlov's experiments, which showed that animals can associate a cue, such as a bell, with food. The new findings suggest the hippocampus supports a more sophisticated version of this process, using memory and context to anticipate outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease patients often struggle not only to remember the past but also to learn from experience and make decisions. By showing that the healthy hippocampus helps turn memories into predictions, the study offers a new framework for understanding why learning and decision-making are affected early in Alzheimer's disease and opens the door to research into how this predictive signal may fail and be restored.

UBC Okanagan researchers have advanced their work on developing a non-invasive, accessible way to reduce uncontrolled hand tremors.

In a newly published study, the team has demonstrated how a new wearable device may reduce involuntary hand tremors linked with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.

Hand tremors affect millions of people worldwide and can interfere with everyday activities such as eating, writing and personal care, explains Dr. Hadi Mohammadi, Professor in UBCO's School of Engineering. Current treatments often involve medication or surgery, while existing wearable devices can be costly, bulky or cause unwanted side effects.

Hand tremors are among the most prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorders, causing involuntary upper-limb fluctuations that significantly impair a person's quality of life. Although not life-threatening, tremors can severely impair daily living and adversely impact psychological wellbeing."

Dr. Hadi Mohammadi, Professor, UBCO's School of Engineering

Since 2018, UBC Okanagan's Heart Valve Performance Laboratory has been researching ways to reduce hand tremor attenuation using patient-centred, mechanically driven solutions. While medications and therapy provide limited relief, wearable devices that suppress tremors offer a promising non-invasive alternative, he says.

A typical hand tremor absorber works by counteracting the involuntary shaking with a mechanical or electronic device.

But Dr. Mohammadi's research, published recently in the Journal of Medical Engineering & Technology, takes a different approach. The lightweight, wearable brace works without the need for motors, batteries or invasive procedures-making it accessible to many people.

"Rather than actively driving motion, the device uses a passive omnidirectional vibration-absorbing mechanism tuned to the frequency range of the uncontrolled tremors," he says. "When worn on the hand, the system dampens involuntary fluctuations while allowing voluntary movement to continue largely unhindered."

Through a combination of computer modelling and experimental testing-using a full-scale mannequin arm with a simulator designed to replicate tremor patterns-the researchers saw a 79 per cent reduction in unidirectional tremors and a 73 per cent reduction in omnidirectional tremors.

"Our goal was to develop a solution that is effective, wearable and practical for everyday use," says Dr. Dylan Goode, lab manager in the Heart Valve Performance Laboratory, which is led by Dr. Mohammadi. "By using a passive system, we can reduce tremors without adding complexity, power requirements or limiting natural movement."

UBCO master's student Manthan Shah completed his thesis on this technology and notes that the orthosis is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed-addressing many of the comfort and usability limitations that have historically limited the adoption of wearable tremor suppression devices.

While the results are promising, Dr. Mohammadi says the next step is clinical testing with human participants to evaluate real-world performance, comfort and impact on daily function. If successful, the technology could offer a non-invasive, low-maintenance option for people living with tremor-related disorders, either as a standalone aid or as a complement to existing treatments.

"This work represents a meaningful step toward improving functional independence and quality of life for people living with hand tremors," he adds. "We hope that this technology will soon be in the hands of patients in British Columbia and across Canada."

A team of researchers from the Andalusian Centre for Molecular Biology and Regenerative Medicine (CABIMER) and the University of Seville, in collaboration with the Virgen Macarena University Hospital, have identified a fundamental mechanism that links the 24-hour circadian cycle to the precise repair of DNA breaks. This study, which focused on the circadian protein Cryptochrome1 (CRY1), suggests that the time of day when radiotherapy is administered can significantly influence the effectiveness of treatment for certain types of cancer.

Maintaining genomic stability is essential to prevent the onset of cancer. It is therefore important that DNA breaks are repaired as accurately as possible. Indeed, it is relatively common for cancer cells to be unable to repair their DNA efficiently. Consequently, multiple cancer treatments, such as radiotherapy, exploit this weakness by generating DNA breaks that tumor cells are unable to repair.This study shows that DNA break repair in human cells exhibits a circadian oscillation. In other words, its efficiency is not homogeneous, but varies cyclically depending on the time of day. In a normal human cycle, repair activity peaks in the early morning and then decreases gradually until nightfall, subsequently increasing again during the night.

Our research has identified that this regulation depends on a central component of the biological clock, namely the CRY1 protein. This protein acts as a timer and its abundance changes naturally during the day/night cycle. In fact, the repair process reacts directly to CRY1 levels.When CRY1 levels are low (corresponding to early morning in humans), efficient DNA repair is stimulated. Conversely, when CRY1 levels increase (which occurs naturally in the afternoon/evening), repair is reduced, thereby increasing the sensitivity of cells to DNA-breaking agents such as ionizing radiation.

This circadian regulation has a direct impact on cancer progression and response to radiotherapy in specific tumors. Our study findings suggest that the reduction in repair that occurs when CRY1 levels are high can be exploited therapeutically.Thus, breast cancer patients with tumors expressing higher levels of CRY1 were found to be more sensitive to radiotherapy. In addition, a retrospective analysis of patient data from the Virgen Macarena University Hospital revealed a significant difference in overall survival based on the time of irradiation: treatment in the afternoon/evening, when CRY1 levels are naturally higher, made tumor samples more sensitive to radiotherapy and improved patient prognosis. This effect was also observed in patients with prostate cancer and breast cancer, but not in lung cancer or gliomas. Therefore, these findings open the door to exploring the therapeutic potential of irradiation at specific times of the day, a phenomenon known as chronoradiotherapy.

If severe DNA damage is not repaired, the consequences for the health of cells and tissues are dramatic. A study led by researchers at Goethe University Frankfurt, part of the Rhine-Main University Alliance, shows that the failure of a key DNA repair enzyme called SPRTN not only results in genetic damage, but also triggers chronic inflammatory responses that accelerate aging and lead to developmental abnormalities. The findings shed light on the rare hereditary disorder Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome and may open new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

Although DNA is tightly packed and protected within the cell nucleus, it is constantly threatened by damage from normal metabolic processes or external stressors such as radiation or chemical substances. To counteract this, cells rely on an elaborate network of repair mechanisms. When these systems fail, DNA damage can accumulate, impair cellular function, and contribute to cancer, aging, and degenerative diseases.

One particularly severe form of DNA damage are the so-called DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs), in which proteins become attached to DNA. DPCs can arise from alcohol consumption, exposure to substances such as formaldehyde or other aldehydes, or from errors made by enzymes involved in DNA replication and repair. Because DPCs can cause serious errors during cell division by stalling DNA replication, DNA-protein crosslinks pose a serious threat to genome integrity.The enzyme SPRTN removes DPCs by cleaving the DNA-protein crosslinks. SPRTN malfunctions, for example as a result of mutations, may predispose individuals to develop bone deformities and liver cancer in their teenage years. This rare genetic disorder is known as Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome. Its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood, and there are no specific therapies.Now a research team led by Prof. Ivan Ðikić from the Institute of Biochemistry II at Goethe University demonstrated that the loss of a functional SPRTN enzyme not only leads to the accumulation of damaged DNA in the cell nucleus. Using cell culture experiment and genetically modified mice they found out that, in addition, DNA from the nucleus also leaks into the interior of the cell, the cytoplasm.DNA in the cytoplasm is recognized by the cell as a danger signal, as such DNA usually originates from invading viruses or bacteria or from malignant transformation. Cytoplasmic DNA therefore activates defense mechanisms in the cell by initiating the so-called cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Furthermore, the cell releases messenger substances that attract immune cells, leading to chronic inflammation.The Frankfurt-led research team observed that this chronic inflammatory response is especially pronounced in the mouse embryos and persists in adulthood, particularly in the lung and liver. As a result, the mice died early or showed signs of premature aging similar to those seen in people with Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome. Blocking the relevant immune response alleviated many of the symptoms.

Unrepaired DNA-protein crosslinks have broader systemic consequences. They not only compromise genome stability but also drive chronic inflammation that can significantly influence lifespan."

Prof. Ivan Ðikić, Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University

The physician and molecular biologist sees potential for the development of therapies: "In addition to Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome, there are other rare genetic diseases in which DNA-protein crosslinks play an important role. With our work, we have laid an important foundation for future therapeutic approaches to these diseases as well. By studying the underlying mechanisms of these rare diseases, we discovered a new link between DNA damage, inflammatory responses, and the lifespan of an organism. This also contributes to the understanding of the biology of aging."Partners in the research project included Goethe University and Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (Institute of Molecular Biology/Professor Petra Beli and Institute of Transfusion Medicine/Professor Daniela Krause) within the Rhine-Main Universities alliance (RMU), the German Consortium for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), EPFL Lausanne, Charité Berlin and the Universities of Cologne and Split (Croatia).

Barbara Tuszynski was concerned about her vision but confident in her insurance coverage when she went to an eye clinic last May.

The retiree, 70, was diagnosed with glaucoma in her right eye in 2019. She had a laser procedure to treat it in 2022, and she uses medicated drops in both eyes to prevent more damage. She is supposed to be checked regularly, she said.

During the May appointment, Tuszynski's optometrist examined her eyes and reassured her that the glaucoma had not worsened.

Tuszynski, who lives in central Wisconsin, had looked up beforehand whether the clinic in nearby Madison participated in her insurance plan. The insurer's website listed the optometrist's name with a green check mark and the words "in-network." She assumed that meant her policy would cover the appointment.

Then the bill came.

An optometrist tested Tuszynski's vision and took pictures of her optic nerves.

$340, which included $120 for vision testing and $100 for optic nerve imaging.

Tuszynski's UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plan declined to pay for her eye appointment. "The member has no out of network benefits," the company's denial letter said.

Tuszynski felt like she was seeing double. How could an eye doctor be in-network and out-of-network at the same time? She said she sent the insurer a screenshot of its own webpage showing the clinic listed as in-network.

She said that after she complained, UnitedHealthcare representatives explained that the eye clinic was in-network under her vision plan, so her policy would cover the clinic's services related to glasses or contact lenses. But they said the clinic was not in-network for her medical insurance plan, and glaucoma treatment is considered a medical issue.

Tuszynski was baffled that care for a patient's eyes would not be covered by vision insurance. She said she didn't realize that insurers can have contracts with eye clinics to provide some services but not others.

UnitedHealthcare spokesperson Meg Sergel said such arrangements are common, including with non-Medicare insurance provided by employers or purchased by individuals. "I looked up my eye doctor, and it's the same thing," she said in an interview with KFF Health News.

Sergel said she understood how a customer could mistakenly think vision insurance would cover all care for the eyes. She said UnitedHealthcare recommends that before undergoing treatment, patients ask care providers whether they are in-network for specific services.

Otherwise, she said, to know whether a test or treatment is covered by vision insurance, "you'd have to read the nitty-gritty" of a policy.

Leaders at Steinhauer Family Eye Clinic, where Tuszynski saw the optometrist, declined to comment.

Casey Schwarz, senior counsel for education and federal policy at the nonprofit Medicare Rights Center, said such complications frequently come up when Medicare Advantage members try to use their insurance at eye clinics or dental offices.

The federal government pays insurers to run Medicare Advantage plans for people who choose them instead of traditional Medicare. More than half of Medicare beneficiaries sign up for the private plans. Many offer routine vision and dental coverage that isn't included with traditional Medicare.

"We hear from people who choose these plans because of those supplemental benefits, but there is not a lot of transparency around them," Schwarz said.

After receiving the rejection letter, Tuszynski repeatedly contacted UnitedHealthcare to question the decision and filed an appeal with the company. Then, she said, she called a Medicare hotline to complain to federal officials. She also wrote to KFF Health News, which asked the insurer about the case.

UnitedHealthcare eventually agreed to cover the bill as if the service had been in-network. "In good faith, we made an exception," Sergel said. However, Tuszynski was warned that if she received medical care from the clinic again, it would not be covered, because the clinic remains out-of-network for such services, Sergel said. "It doesn't sound like that pleased her."

Tuszynski confirmed that she is not pleased.

She said she lost sleep over the dispute and felt that it shouldn't have taken so much effort to obtain a fair outcome. "It's just been a horrible, difficult whirlwind," she said.

Schwarz said regulators should require insurance companies to clearly explain to customers and care providers how different procedures and services will be covered under vision, dental, and health plans. "They're tricky," she said.

In an ideal world, Schwarz said, Medicare would consider things like dental cleanings, eye checkups, and hearing aids as basic health care that would be covered in the same way as other medical care. But until that happens, she said, patients with any doubt should call their insurers beforehand to check whether services will be covered.

Tricia Neuman, a senior vice president with KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, noted that Medicare's website now includes a tool that can help people determine whether their doctors participate in a Medicare Advantage plan.

"This is helpful and a step forward, but information about provider networks is not always correct," Neuman said. "Errors can come at a cost to enrollees, unless they are willing and able to take on their insurer."

Tuszynski worked for 30 years as a secretary in hospitals and at doctors' offices, so she's familiar with billing issues, she said. "If I can't sort through all this, how can anybody else do it?"

She knows her $340 bill was much smaller than the medical debts many other people face. But she said it was a serious amount of money to her, and she was glad she objected to the insurer's contention that the bill shouldn't be covered.

"I have a strong feeling about right and wrong — and this is just wrong," she said.

For 2026, she decided to shift out of her Medicare Advantage plan. She now is enrolled in traditional Medicare, plus a supplemental plan to help with copays and other costs. She pays $184 a month for that plan, compared with paying no separate premium for her old Medicare Advantage plan.

Now she won't have to worry about private insurers' limited networks of contracted care providers, she said. Her glaucoma treatment will be covered at the Madison eye clinic.

However, she no longer has insurance coverage for eyeglasses, just a discount plan if she buys glasses from certain stores. She used her Medicare Advantage insurance to buy new glasses shortly before switching. "Hopefully, those will last me a while," she said.

Recent reports of Nipah virus (NiV) infections in West Bengal, India, have reignited global concern, prompting public health authorities to prioritize research into this high-mortality pathogen. In response, Sino Biological, Inc., a global leader in recombinant technology, has announced the accelerated availability and development of critical research tools to support the global scientific community in combating NiV.

Nipah virus, a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a priority pathogen due to its epidemic potential and high fatality rate (estimated between 40 % to 75 %). With no approved vaccines or specific antiviral treatments currently available, the demand for high-quality, biologically active reagents is critical for developing effective countermeasures.

To meet the urgent needs of researchers, Sino Biological has launched a series of high-purity NiV G and F proteins. These proteins are essential for understanding viral entry mechanisms and screening therapeutic antibodies. Additionally, the company is fast-tracking the development of NiV N proteins and pre-fusion and post-fusion F trimer proteins. The N proteins are based on the most recently reported strains, offering improved sequence relevance compared with existing products that contain multiple mutations. In addition to standard proteins, Sino Biological offers ProPure™ endotoxin-free (ET-free) versions of NiV G and F proteins, designed for vaccine research applications where immunogen purity and endotoxin control are critical.

Our mission is to provide the scientific community with the highest quality tools as rapidly as possible when emerging infectious diseases threaten global health. By expanding our NiV portfolio, we aim to empower researchers to streamline vaccine discovery and diagnostic breakthroughs."

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in the tissue around oral cancers both increases nerve sensitivity and makes opioids less effective, according to new research published in Science Signaling.

The findings point to a shared mechanism underlying both oral cancer pain and opioid tolerance-and a possible new treatment strategy for both. 

Repurposing existing cancer drugs that block EGFR may be a promising way to manage oral cancer pain and prevent or reverse opioid tolerance."

Yi Ye, PhD, associate professor at NYU College of Dentistry and associate director of clinical research operations at NYU Dentistry's Translational Research Center

Oral cancer can be extremely painful, making it difficult for patients to eat, drink, and speak. Despite the well-known side effects and risk for addiction, opioids are still seen by experts as the gold standard for treating oral cancer pain. In order to effectively manage this pain, patients often need high doses of opioids and develop tolerance more quickly than those with other forms of chronic pain, requiring larger and larger doses to treat it.

"In the field of pain research, we struggle with the fact that-even after all these decades of research-the best drug on the market is often still opiates, which come with many risks," said Ye, the study's senior author and a faculty member at the NYU Pain Research Center. 

When people with cancer experience pain, the severity of the pain tends to increase as a tumor grows, suggesting that there may be shared molecular drivers behind both processes-ones that could be targeted to manage both cancer and pain.

"We are increasingly finding that cancer and the nervous system are interconnected. In my lab, we're trying to address whether there's a common, overlapping mechanism between cancer and pain," added Ye.

EGFR, a protein found on the surface of certain cells involved in promoting cell growth and division, has emerged as an important target in cancer treatment. The receptor is overexpressed in most oral cancers, and several FDA-approved drugs that block or inhibit EGFR are used to treat lung, breast, colon, pancreatic, and oral cancers. 

Notably, some research shows that when patients receive EGFR inhibitors to treat their cancers, they also experience rapid pain relief. Additional studies point to EGFR's role in other pain conditions and in opioid tolerance.

In the Science Signaling study, the research team from NYU Dentistry, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and Loma Linda University School of Dentistry studied human tissue samples from patients with oral cancer as well as mice with oral cancer to better understand the role of EGFR signaling. In both human and mouse cells, they found that cancer cells and nearby glial cells secreted EGFR ligands, the molecules that activate the receptors. 

EGFR was overexpressed in human and mouse nerves associated with oral cancer tumors, including in trigeminal ganglia, the main sensory nerve cells in the face and mouth. This EGFR activation also drove signaling and hyperactivity of the glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-a well-studied pain signaling receptor that is thought to play a critical role in the development of opioid tolerance-in trigeminal ganglia and the brainstem.

In additional studies in mice, the researchers found that EGFR ligands that activate the receptor in the trigeminal system increased pain and made morphine less effective. In contrast, giving the mice an EGFR inhibitor drug both reduced pain and restored the analgesic effects of morphine.

"These results are clinically significant and reveal a link between EGFR signaling and NMDAR hyperactivity, a mechanism that heightens pain signaling and reduces the effectiveness of opioid analgesics," said study author Hui-Lin Pan, MD, PhD, professor of anesthesiology and perioperative medicine at MD Anderson.

This new mechanistic understanding of oral cancer pain and opioid tolerance suggests a new-and not-so-new-approach to better treating oral cancer pain: EGFR inhibitors. Because these drugs have been widely studied as cancer treatments, researchers already know about their safety and side effects. Moreover, EGFR inhibitors might reduce pain and the need for more opioids while also controlling the cancer.

"This study provides a rationale for repurposing FDA-approved EGFR inhibitors already used to treat oral cancers, shifting from symptomatic suppression to mechanistic intervention. This approach may offer dual benefits, controlling cancer while addressing pain through a non-opioid, biologically rational approach that could dramatically improve quality of life," said Moran Amit, MD, PhD, assistant professor of head and neck surgery at MD Anderson.

The researchers are continuing to look at the role of EGFR and its ligands in oral cancer pain and opioid tolerance by analyzing patients' tumor and blood samples, alongside self-reported pain scores and opioid use. In addition, leveraging an existing clinical trial on EGFR inhibitors in oral cancer regression, the team plans to retrospectively evaluate the impact of EGFR inhibitors on pain relief using clinical records.

"In drug development, it can take decades for a new compound to actually reach the market. If our mechanism holds true in future studies, repurposing EGFR inhibitors is appealing because it could lead to rapid translation and quickly help patients," said Ye.

"These findings could significantly impact the way we treat cancer pain, providing a targeted approach that mitigates the detrimental side effects seen with opioids. This new treatment approach provides hope to both patients and clinicians treating oral cancer alike," said study author Chi Viet, DDS, MD, PhD, associate professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry.

Additional study authors include Naijiang Liu, Xiaojie Shi, Maria Daniela Santi, Maria Fernanda Pessano Fialho, Rocco Latorre, and Nigel Bunnett of NYU Dentistry; Shao-Rui Chen, Hong Chen, Tongxin Xie, and Frederico Gleber-Netto of MD Anderson; and Dong Minh Phuong of Loma Linda University School of Dentistry. The research was supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (R01DE032501, RM1DE033491).

Researchers have developed a way to grow a highly specialized subset of brain nerve cells that are involved in motor neuron disease and damaged in spinal injuries.

Their study, published today in eLife as the final Version of Record after appearing previously as a Reviewed Preprint, presents what the editors call fundamental findings on the directed differentiation of a rare population of special brain progenitors – also known as adult or parent stem cells – into corticospinal-like neurons. The editors note that the work provides compelling data demonstrating the success of this new approach.

The findings set the stage for further research into whether these molecularly directed neurons can form functional connections in the body, and to explore their potential use in human diseases where corticospinal neurons are compromised.

The nervous system comprises diverse neurons with many distinctive features including shape, anatomical position, connections to other neurons (their circuitry), the genes they express, patterns of electrical conductivity, and ultimately their function. These unique subpopulations of neurons arise from tightly controlled and precise differentiation processes that direct them to transition from immature nerve stem cells to fully mature, specialised neurons. Because they are so specialised, such distinct "subtypes" of neurons are often particularly vulnerable to, or associated with neurodegenerative injuries or diseases.

"To realistically model diseases and screen for potential treatments, or to regenerate neurons that are damaged in spinal injuries, we need reliable approaches to accurately differentiate progenitor cells into these specific types of neurons," explains co-lead author Kadir Ozkan, who at the time of the study was a Postdoctoral Fellow in senior author Jeffrey Macklis' lab at the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, and Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, US. "Generic or regionally similar neurons do not adequately reflect the selective vulnerability of neuron subtypes in most human neurodegenerative diseases or injuries."

Corticospinal neurons are crucial cells that degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of motor neuron disease. Damage to these cells' long axons – the extensions that connect from the cell bodies in the brain through the spinal cord to their target spinal motor neurons – underlies the loss of voluntary and skilled movement seen in people with spinal cord injuries.

There are currently no appropriate in vitro models for investigating the selective vulnerability and degeneration of corticospinal neurons in ALS or to explore potential routes to regeneration in spinal cord injury. This critically limits the relevance of much existing research."

Jeffrey Macklis, senior author, the Max and Anne Wien Professor of Life Sciences, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, and Center for Brain Science, Harvard University

Previous work from the Macklis Lab and others has identified central molecular programs that first broadly, and then with increasing precision, control and regulate the specification, diversity and connectivity of specific neuron subtypes in the cerebral cortex during the period of their differentiation. Building on that work, the team has identified a subset of progenitor cells in the postnatal and adult cortex that can be captured and differentiated in the lab into neurons with unique characteristics of corticospinal neurons.

"Knowing that a subset of early progenitors and glial cells in the cortex share a common ancestry with cortical 'projection neurons', we hypothesised that some of these progenitors might retain dormant neurogenic potential – that is, the potential to differentiate into neurons," explains co-lead author Hari Padmanabhan, who was also a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Macklis Lab at the time of the study. The team found that a subset of progenitor cells producing two important regulatory molecules, Sox6 and Neuron/Glia Antigen 2 (Sox6+/NG2+ cells), are poised to develop into neurons. "We wanted to grow these cortical SOX6+/NG2+ progenitors in the lab and see if we could direct their differentiation into corticospinal neurons."

To achieve this, the team designed a multi-component gene-expression system termed "NVOF" to precisely fine tune the regulatory signals the progenitor cells require. The system enabled them to drive cells down a highly specific differentiation route where they acquire the hallmark characteristics of corticospinal neurons, rather than the features of other types of central nervous system neurons.

As they anticipated, the NVOF programming produced mature neurons from the progenitors with the same distinct shape, key cell markers, molecular-gene expression, and electrical connectivity as seen in native corticospinal neurons. By contrast, a widely employed approach to differentiate neuron-like cells by switching on just the Neurogenin2 gene resulted in cells of a mixed identity with abnormal forms (morphology) and molecular features.

eLife's editors note that, as the study demonstrates reprogramming in vitro only – that is, not using living model organisms – future research is needed to assess how these reprogrammed corticospinal neurons integrate and function under physiological conditions and in models of trauma or neurodegeneration.

"We have identified a subset of cortical progenitor cells with strong potential to differentiate into specialised neurons for disease modelling in ALS and spinal cord injury, and for regenerative therapies," concludes Macklis. "Importantly, SOX6+/NG2+ progenitor cells are widely distributed in the cortex, already positioned near sites of degeneration or pathology. This adds substantially to their therapeutic potential, pending further study, including with human pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical progenitors."

Seattle Reign FC defender Jordyn Bugg has been nominated for Seattle Sports Commission's Sports Star of the Year award, in the Women's Sports category. This award acknowledges and celebrates the vast array of powerful athletes throughout women's sports in the state of Washington.

Bugg is up for the award alongside five other nominees in Washington, including Yvonne Ejim (Gonzaga Basketball), Emily Lundgren (WSU Swimming), Amanda & Hana Hull (UW Track & Field), Carolina Penner (Seattle U Soccer) and Gabby Williams (Seattle Storm).

In 2025, Bugg completed her first full NWSL season after signing with the Reign in July 2024. From her 25 regular-season appearances in the backline, the 19-year-old stalwart made 129 clearances and 26 tackles, in addition to winning 36 aerial duels. She was named to the NWSL Team of the Month twice over the course of the season – in March and June.

She added three goals, showing up for the Reign in critical road matches. Each of her goals decided the result of the match, and her first-ever professional goal in North Carolina, was nominated for the FIFA Marta Award.

Adding to her accolades, Bugg was the youngest-ever Finalist for NWSL Defender of the Year, an NWSL Best XI second team honoree and was voted Reign FC's Defender of the Year by her teammates. She also won Reign FC's Goal of Year, as voted on by Reign fans on social media.

On the international stage, the California native had a breakout year, earning her first cap for the United States Women's National Team. She has now amassed six caps and five starts for the squad and was nominated for the U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year award.

Vote now for Bugg to win the Sports Star of the Year, Women's Sports award HERE. Voting ends February 14.

With some Americans potentially on the move, and a few surprises in store, GOAL's writers take a look at the state of the transfer window.

Welcome to the final few days of the transfer window. First of all, it must be established that the January window ending in February is a shocking move. The game is gone - we now have proof. But since we're here and these things cannot be changed, it might be time for a little analysis. There hasn't been a blockbuster move yet. Whether it be a bit of reluctance due to the World Cup or a change in scouting approaches, no one - outside of Man City - is spending big. 

But there are a few names that could still move. U.S. international Ricardo Pepi has been in conversations. So, supposedly has Weston McKennie. And outside of the American sphere, there's chat of a career rebirth for Raheem Sterling, and a well-deserved step up for Jean Philippe-Mateta, who has been excellent for some time now. There will also, one would imagine, be some real surprises here (we can dream). 

Either way, there's plenty to analyze. And GOAL's writers break it all down in a transfer window edition of... The Rondo.

Tom Hindle: Mateta to somewhere or another. The latest chat is that the move from Nottingham Forest fell apart, and now, somehow, Milan are in for the big man. It seems an odd fit, but here we are. Either way, he's gotta get out of there. Welcome to the Rossoneri, Jean. There's also a shout for Josh Sargent to Toronto. Sure, it should happen, but it's hard to root for a player who's gone on strike. 

Ryan Tolmich: Sargent to Toronto FC. It's just gotten too negative to see this continuing, and if Sargent is really dug in about only going to Toronto, it would be a nightmare for Norwich to not let that happen. It's unfortunate it got this far, given Sargent's status at the club, but it's hard to imagine them continuing to work together now.

TH: If you'd asked a few weeks ago, it would have been Mo Salah out of Liverpool, but he needs to stick around now - especially given the injury issues the Reds have. So let's go for a slightly deeper cut and say Kalvin Phillips needs to get out of Man City. He was a proper footballer for a couple of years there, and deserves to be playing this sport at a decent level someplace. 

RT: It would be really nice to see Raheem Sterling land somewhere that actually cares about him. It's been so long since he's been an important piece at a club, and now that he's a free agent, he'll have different types of options for whatever his next step is. Hopefully, that next step is worthwhile because he deserves one more real run before it's all said and done.

TH: Yes, for now. But it won't be the end of the world if he leaves. We're on that fun ole cycle where McKennie becomes pretty valuable to his club again after being almost booted out. It's a nice vibe, for now, but surely the guy has to head somewhere else after the World Cup. If this is a club that sort of looks after him, what might he be able to achieve where he's sincerely looked after?

RT: Absolutely. He holds all the cards now, and he'll continue to hold them if he can move for free this summer. He's proven that he can be a legitimate contributor at a Champions League level. Surely, someone, whether it's Juve or elsewhere, will be willing to pay pretty good money to bring that in this summer.

TH: No. He's injured. He's scoring goals when he's not. We're four months from a World Cup. Who cares if he's banging them in for PSV, Fulham, or Shrewsbury? Stay. 

RT: Probably not. He won't be healthy until March, and by then, the fight to get into the XI would be pretty difficult. Even if he cracks it by April, that gives him just a few short weeks with a new club to really show what he can do. Instead, he can stay at PSV, come back firing, and then make a move post-World Cup. It makes more sense for everyone, except maybe the buying club, if he does score this summer.

TH: Show me a better one than Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool, dare you. A word too, for Dele Alli to Spurs in 2015, which is a little more of a hipster favorite.

RT: It's Virgil van Dijk, and it's not particularly close. Don't argue.

TH: If only to stick with the scouse thing, it has to be Andy Carroll to Liverpool - especially after Fernando Torres left on the same day. 

RT: The Alexis Sanchez - Henrikh Mkhitaryan swap deal. It's not often that you see a deal that both sides lose, and it's hard to even argue which side lost more. A complete disaster all around that had lasting ramifications for both sides for several years.

Less than five months before the 2026 World Cup, U.S. men's national soccer coach Mauricio Pochettino indicated that he has better things to do than answer questions about ticket prices, which on some sites are approaching $9,000 per ticket.

“It's not about us to provide our opinion,” Pochettino said. “Our responsibility is to play and perform on the pitch.”

Pochettino said during a video conference call from FIFA offices in Coral Gables, Florida, that players and coaches have no control over ticket prices and shouldn't be expected to explain the price of admission for the tournament, which runs from June 11 to July 19.

Pochettino responded to a question about American forward Timothy Weah, who said World Cup tickets were too expensive and that some fans would not be able to afford to attend the games.

“Players need to talk on the pitch playing football. It's not his duty to evaluate the price of the ticket," Pochetinno said about Weah's comments. "My duty is to prepare the team in the best way to perform. We are not politicians; we are sports people. We can talk about our jobs. If FIFA does something or [makes] some decision, they know why and it is their responsibility to explain why.”

Weah had told French outlet Le Dauphiné: "Football should still be enjoyed by everyone. It is the most popular sport. This World Cup will be good, but it will be more of a show."

World soccer's governing body, FIFA, has repeatedly defended its pricing, and once ticket prices hit the secondary market next week, prices could surge.

“FIFA is doing an amazing job around the world, uniting people,” Pochettino added, stressing he is not a politician. "I think for sure you need the media to ask directly to FIFA ...

"We need to be focusing in the sports side and trust in the organization that is in charge of soccer or football around the world that they are going to do the right things."

Lionel Messi is considered to already be acting like Inter Miami's owner, with former MLS star Bacary Sagna telling GOAL of why the Argentine icon has found the perfect home at this stage of his career. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner continues to enjoy success on the field in the United States, while also enhancing his global brand away from the pitch.

Messi decided to go chasing the American dream in 2023 when reaching the end of his contract at Paris Saint-Germain. The Barcelona legend accepted a call from Manchester United great David Beckham and headed to South Florida.

He made an immediate impact, with Leagues Cup success being savoured within weeks of his arrival. The South American GOAT has gone on to rewrite the record books with back-to-back MVP awards and a historic MLS Cup triumph.

All of that has been achieved with a smile on his face, with Messi and wife Antonela finding the ideal surroundings for their young family - having struggled to settle in France across two seasons with PSG.

Messi can be more ‘normal' in the States, with greater freedom afforded to him in his private life, and that is considered to be helping competitive fires to burn as brightly as ever. He also has plenty of say on recruitment business in Miami and how the Herons are run.

Sagna, who spent time in MLS with Montreal Impact after representing Arsenal and Manchester City in the Premier League, has - in association with Parimatch Online Casino - told GOAL of Messi in Miami: “He's a phenomenon. He was born with talent, with the gifts. If you combine his game and passion and love, it makes things perfect and allows him to make the impact he is still having at his age. You have players like him that are phenomenons.

“It's not only the performance on the pitch, it is the whole generation that is following them. The fans that are in the US today, having the World Cup will only be good for American football. They are the type of people that can change the world and make a big impact on how people think and play.

“I think he is having an amazing time in Miami. Miami is a Spanish-speaking city, so he is feeling at home. I think he is already like an owner of the club, his family is very present. It's like being at home. He could play for a few more years.”

Pressed further on whether Messi could take inspiration from ex-England captain Beckham and move into club ownership when he retires, Sagna added: “I think he will stay in Miami. It suits him. There are a lot of Spanish speakers, and his English is not great! It's like being in a safe environment.

“Being in the US, business-wise, is perfect for him because he is a brand. Building this brand for after football is perfect for him and his kids. He seems to like playing for the club. He has David Beckham next to him. Also the power of adidas, which is another point to add. They are building something together.

“At the minute he is playing and can't get involved with the surroundings of the club, but he is involved with his performances. He has his work and will help to bring more players into the club.”

Fellow former Barcelona stars Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Luis Suarez followed Messi to Miami. World Cup-winning Argentina team-mate Rodrigo De Paul has also trodden that path, while the likes of Thomas Muller and Son Heung-min are elsewhere in MLS.

Asked if more big names will follow, with there already talk of Neymar and Robert Lewandowski potentially heading to the States at some point, Sagna said: “I see more because it is an exciting league, especially at the end of your career. It's having fun and still enjoying football. 

“You have quality players, especially South American players. America put on a show every game, fireworks etc. They don't have as many restrictions on the private side of things. You can enjoy walking around the cities. Messi couldn't do that because of who he is, constantly walking on the street, but you can do that there and see America in real life. 

“The approach is totally different. I don't want to call it a mini-retirement, but you learn how to love football differently by playing there.”

Messi will, much to the delight of a US audience, be sticking around for a few more years as he has signed a contract extension through 2028. He is expected to enjoy a mid-season break in MLS this year when forming part of Argentina's World Cup title defence.

Mykhailo Mudryk is being prevented from doing his day job at the moment, with a suspension being served at Chelsea due to alleged doping violations, but he is keeping himself amused away from the football field. The Ukrainian winger has indulged in some playful flirting with American actor and social media star Jordyn Jones, with a possible romance on the cards there.

Mudryk has not kicked a competitive ball in anger for over a year, with it announced in December 2024 that he was being stung with a ban. The 25-year-old had finally found a spark for the Blues by that point, as he impressed in Conference League competition.

He is now cutting a frustrated figure again, with just 21 goal contributions being posted through 73 appearances on the back of his £62 million ($85m) transfer to Stamford Bridge in January 2023.

Mudryk, who still faces the threat of an even longer sentence, said in June 2025 after seeing charges made official by the Football Association: “This has come as a complete shock as I have never knowingly used any banned substances or broken any rules, and am working closely with my team to investigate how this could have happened.

“I know that I have not done anything wrong and remain hopeful that I will be back on the pitch soon. I cannot say any more now due to the confidentiality of the process, but I will as soon as I can.”

Mudryk remains hopeful of clearing his name and resuming his professional career, but for now he is enjoying regular contact with 25-year-old actress Jones. His attempts to woo the Michigan native began in September 2025 when he commented on a video, saying: “Guys, should I try?”

He subsequently invited Jones to Disneyland in Paris, and she shared pictures with her nine million Instagram followers from the French capital a couple of days later. Speculation immediately began to rage regarding a hooking up with Mudryk.

The Ukraine international continues to make his presence known in public, with Mudryk commenting on an image of Jones and a set of roses in Oxfordshire: “Flowers suit you”. Jones responded with: “Why thank you darling.”

Mudryk is said to have been in regular contact with Jones on social media, calling her “the cutest” at one stage while sharing a single rose and heart emoji. He has also said in another message: “Save your tears for another day.”

Jones has continued to stir the spot when sharing an image of her wearing a Chelsea scarf. She has also followed Mudryk back on Instagram. That has got fans around the world gossiping about their relationship.

Jones made her name as a dancer in the early 2010s. She has appeared in Shake It Up on screen and now does regular modelling work. Mudryk's eye has been caught, with the Chelsea-owned star prepared to try his luck in the smooth-talking stakes.

The Blues have changed manager since Mudryk was hit with his ban. Enzo Maresca was relieved of his coaching duties on New Year's Day, paving the way for Liam Rosenior to fill his first Premier League post.

He admits to having held no talks with Mudryk, who is prevented from training alongside his colleagues at Cobham. Rosenior has said: “Not yet. It's definitely something that I want to do, but there are many things I want to do and haven't been able to do.

“But, no, he's a magnificent player. He's had a really difficult time and when the moment is right for me and him and the club, I'll definitely have a conversation with him. The time is right when I speak with the board and the sporting directors and when it's right that he's in a place where I can have an impact, in a positive way, on his career.”

Chelsea, who continue to compete on four fronts this season and have secured automatic qualification for the last-16 of the Champions League, will be back in Premier League action on Saturday when taking in a derby date with London rivals West Ham.

According to Meu Timao, Corinthians endured a day of contrasting fortunes on Wednesday. The women's side reached the final of the inaugural Women's Club World Cup, while the men were beaten in their Brasileiro opener.

In the morning in London at the Gtech Community Stadium, Corinthians faced Gotham FC of the United States in the semi-final. Gabi Zanotti scored late in the second half to seal a 1-0 win.

They will meet Arsenal of England in Sunday's final, scheduled for 15:00 Brasília time.

The win also guaranteed a financial boost. Both finalists will receive at least US$ one million, about R$ five point three million, while the champions will earn an additional US$ one point three million, roughly R$ six point nine million, for a total of US$ two point three million, around R$ twelve point two million.

In the evening, the men's team began the 2026 Campeonato Brasileiro with a 2-1 defeat to Bahia at Vila Belmiro. Breno Bidon scored for Corinthians, while Jean Lucas and Willian José secured the win for the northeastern side.

Corinthians have released a behind-the-scenes film of the 1-0 win over Gotham FC that sealed a place in the FIFA Women's Club World Cup final against Arsenal. According to Meu Timao, it blends provocation with a rallying call for unity.

Running just over 17 minutes, it opens with Gabi Zanotti's decisive strike and celebrations in front of a sizeable Fiel following at Gtech Community Stadium.

The soundtrack features Hylander by Abbot and Somynem.grin, including an expletive aimed at the United States, before cutting to coach Lucas Piccinato and his players at the whistle. A journalist covering Gotham is heard casting the Americans as heavy favourites expected to dominate.

Despite that, the mood stayed light, with singing on the bus and dances, jokes and a makeshift futmesa in the dressing room, before focus sharpened during the pitch walk.

Piccinato's team talk stressed collective work and defensive compactness, urging the group to defend, attack, handle set plays and reorganise together. After the final warm-up, kitman Serginho delivered a fierce message that the match had to be theirs, however it came, and dismissed outside noise.

Match clips follow, then the poropopó with supporters. Zanotti and Gi Fernandes climbed an advertising board as images went viral, before a centre-circle huddle where Piccinato praised the effort and said unity gives the team the tools to win the decider. Corinthians are the first side confirmed for Sunday one February at 15:00, at Emirates Stadium.

Ousmane Dembele's Paris Saint-Germain will face Monaco, while Jose Mourinho's Benfica will take on Real Madrid Getty Images

It was the outcome Real Madrid must surely have dreaded.

After the ignominy of falling out of the Champions League top eight on Wednesday via a defeat at Benfica — which featured the Portuguese side's goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scoring a stoppage-time header to send his team through — the two clubs have been drawn to face each other in February's play-off round.

It means a first return to the Bernabeu for Jose Mourinho since leaving as Real Madrid manager in 2013.

Five of the six English clubs skipped this draw as they qualified for the round of 16 via top-eight finishes in the league phase, but they now have at least a degree more clarity on who they might face when they are next in European action (more on that below).

Newcastle United, the one Premier League team involved in Friday's draw, face a long trip to Azerbaijan to take on Qarabag, while elsewhere the holders Paris Saint-Germain will play fellow Ligue 1 side Monaco.

The first leg of the play-off ties will take place on February 17/18, with the second legs on February 24/25.

Dermot Corrigan, Nick Miller, Seb Stafford-Bloor, Jack Lang and Tom Burrows analyse the draw and what it means for the rest of the Champions League campaign.



Whichever team Real Madrid got in the draw held the potential for more embarrassment, given all the drama and chaos so far this season.

While being drawn to face Benfica brings a chance for immediate revenge after the loss in Lisbon on Wednesday, few at the Bernabeu will be really looking forward to facing their former manager Mourinho again.

The way Mourinho's Benfica relentlessly outran and outbattled Madrid on Wednesday, and ruthlessly targeted their issues in defence, was extremely impressive. New Madrid coach Alvaro Arbeloa and his players will be worried about it happening all over again. All the noise and spectacle that will inevitably surround Mourinho returning for the first time since his turbulent three years in charge over a decade ago adds up to more possible distraction.

Adding to Arbeloa's issues are Rodrygo and Raul Asencio's suspensions for the first leg, with both having been sent off late in Wednesday's game. Centre-back Asencio's absence is particularly important, given the lack of fit defenders in the Madrid squad currently, and there is no sign of club president Florentino Perez sanctioning any emergency signings before the winter transfer window shuts on Monday.

Logistics. It isn't the sexiest of words in the context of European football, competing against the biggest teams and the glittering possibility of silverware, but it is uppermost in Newcastle's thoughts as they attempt to navigate a testing, stretching fixture list.

In those terms, this draw is sub-optimal. Their 2,500-mile journey to Baku, where Qarabag play their home games, is sandwiched between another two away ties, against Aston Villa in the fourth round of the FA Cup and before a trip to Manchester City in the Premier League. In the business half of the season, it really is make-or-break stuff. Talking to reporters on Friday, head coach Eddie Howe admitted Monaco, Newcastle's alternative opponents for the draw, were his preferred option because of that.

In football terms, they will be confident, however, particularly after their 1-1 draw with holders PSG this week. Qarabag, the first Azerbaijani club to qualify from the Champions League group stage, drew 2-2 at home to Chelsea in November, but were thrashed 6-0 by Liverpool on Wednesday. Get through this and either Chelsea or Barcelona await Newcastle in the round of 16.

Losing finalists against PSG last season, Inter started their Champions League campaign with four straight wins, only to come unstuck once the fixtures stiffened up. They now face the very real possibility of becoming the next fall guys in the Bodo/Glimt fairytale. The Norwegians beat Manchester City and Atletico Madrid to sneak into the play-offs and can call on plenty of knockout experience after their run to the Europa League semi-finals last year. Inter will be the favourites, but the peril-o-meter is clicking loudly.

Things won't be easy for Juventus against Galatasaray, either. Okan Buruk's side lead the Turkish league and are always tricky customers on their day — just ask Liverpool, whose only defeat in the competition so far came at the Ali Sami Yen in September. The form table, though, does suggest these sides are heading in opposite directions: 10 of Juve's 13 points came from their past four matches, whereas Galatasaray fell off a cliff halfway through the league phase.

For the neutrals, a repeat of the most recent meeting between the sides would hold some appeal — not for the football played but for the conditions. Their second game in the 2013-14 group stage took place in a blizzard so insistent that the referee stopped it and postponed it for 24 hours… only for the sides to play out the remaining minutes in another snowstorm.

Jack Lang

PSG will be kicking themselves at having to contend with a two-legged play-off game, although an all-French tie against Monaco (the first time the teams have met in European competition) is one they will expect to win.

After five matches, PSG were second in the Champions League table, behind only Arsenal. However, a disappointing goalless draw with Athletic Club, a surprising loss to Sporting CP and that draw at home to Newcastle on Wednesday meant they slipped out of the top eight, finishing 11th.

That summed up the season for Luis Enrique's side so far, with the team struggling to hit the heights of their scintillating 2024-25 campaign, not helped by a lack of proper pre-season after the Club World Cup and injuries to key players. Winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is the latest absentee, picking up a minor ankle injury against Newcastle.

Monaco, who finished third in Ligue 1 last season, have struggled this campaign. They are 10th and their poor form led to Adi Hutter's sacking in October, replaced by Sebastien Pocognoli. Their season highlights include a 1-0 home victory against PSG in November, while they also held Manchester City and Juventus to draws in Europe, and beat Galatasaray and Bodo/Glimt. However, they are without a win in five Ligue 1 matches since that PSG win, while they were hammered 6-1 by Real Madrid this month.

This is usually around the time in the season when PSG click into gear and, having been eliminated from the Coupe de France, the French and European champions can now put full focus on Ligue 1 and the Champions League.

They can also take comfort from last season, when they finished 15th in the Champions League table before defeating another French side, Brest, 10-0 on aggregate in the play-off stage.

They then beat Liverpool, who had topped the league-phase table, in the round of 16, on their way to European glory.

Can they repeat the trick?

You wouldn't bet against them.

Tom Burrows

This is a tricky one for Borussia Dortmund, who suffered that dispiriting defeat by Inter in their last group-stage game and will now have to face another Italian side: Atalanta. The good news for Niko Kovac is that this is no longer Gian Piero Gasperini's team; Atalanta are seventh in Serie A and not as intimidating a proposition (now coached by Raffaele Palladino) as they were a few years ago.

The bad news is that Dortmund are not in form. Serhou Guirassy is mired in a deep slump and his goals have dried up — just nine in the Champions League and Bundesliga combined. That will need to change. As will the impact of Karim Adeyemi, which has been in short supply since the autumn.

The defensive standard they established before German football's winter break will also need to be rediscovered. The defeats to Tottenham Hotspur and Inter on those final two European matchdays were notable for a lack of cutting edge, but also sloppiness at the back. Kovac will get some players back soon and that should help. Niklas Sule and Waldemar Anton should both be fit for Atalanta, and Daniel Svensson will return from his suspension, but Dortmund need to find some momentum, fast.

It could have been a lot worse for the other German team involved in this play-off draw, Bayer Leverkusen. 

Olympiacos are to be respected, of course, particularly given the group-stage result, in which the Greek side beat Leverkusen 2-0. But Leverkusen coach Kasper Hjulmand will welcome the avoidance of one of the big beasts. We saw in the crushing defeat by PSG in the autumn that this rebuilt Leverkusen, with pockets of talent but many, many new parts, are not really equipped to handle continental power.

But Hjulmand will still be wary. His defence is short of chemistry and the kind of understandings necessary to keep clean sheets in difficult environments — which Athens inevitably will be — and first-choice goalkeeper Mark Flekken is among the long-term injured. 

That league-phase game was a match Leverkusen should not have lost. They created the better chances, failed to take them, and paid the price for a weakness against the ball that has been there all season. This will be an awkward tie. 

Seb Stafford-Bloor



Given UEFA does not like to make anything super easy, there are still plenty of eithers, ors, ifs and buts. The automatically-qualified teams won't find out which side of the draw they're on until another draw on February 27, but the path through to the final for the English clubs has become very slightly clearer.

Arsenal will be pleased with the spoils of having finished top of the league phase, given they will face the winner of either Olympiacos vs Leverkusen, or Dortmund vs Atalanta. That could set up a quarter-final against Manchester City, but Pep Guardiola's boys will be less delighted with their lot, as in all likelihood they will play either Real Madrid (assuming Mourinho's power of narrative doesn't lead Benfica to beating Madrid again) or Inter.

Chelsea will be watching the play-offs with interest, because they will either meet PSG, assuming they beat Monaco, or Newcastle, assuming they beat Qarabag: assumption is the mother of all stuff-ups, but as assumptions go, those are two fairly safe ones. If they get through that, it could be another all-English quarter-final, against either Tottenham or Liverpool.

Both of those Premier League sides face a fairly lively round-of-16 game, whatever happens: they are destined for the winners of either Galatasaray vs Juventus, or Club Brugge vs Atletico Madrid.

Advertisement

A couple of other things: Tottenham and Liverpool now know that the earliest they can face Real Madrid is the semi-finals; Newcastle could also face Barcelona again, should they get past Qarabag; if the form in the league phase is anything to go by, and the fact that at least five of the teams already in the last 16 hail from the Premier League, brace yourself for an all-English semi-final line-up.

It likely won't affect Tim Weah's playing time, but U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino downplayed the international player's criticism of World Cup ticket prices, on Thursday.

It likely won't affect Tim Weah's playing time, but U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino downplayed the international player's criticism of World Cup ticket prices, on Thursday.

“First of all, I think players need to talk on the pitch, playing football, not outside of,” Pochettino said Thursday during a Zoom news conference from Coral Gables, Fla. “It is not his duty to evaluate the price of the ticket. And then also my job, my duty is to prepare the team, the U.S. men's national team in the best way to perform. We are not politicians.

“We are sport people that only we can talk about our job and I think if FIFA does something or takes some decision, they know why, and (it) is their responsibility to explain why. But it is not about us to provide our opinion. Our responsibility is to perform, play and perform on the pitch and then the people that is in charge of the federation, maybe he can give his opinion, but I am the head coach of the federation.”

FIFA is charging up to $8,680 list price per ticket for the World Cup. The tournament runs from June 11 to July 19 in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

“It is too expensive,” Weah was quoted as saying this month by France's Le Dauphiné. “I am just a bit disappointed by the ticket prices. Lots of real fans will miss matches.”

Friday morning is usually a time when we look for lighter-hearted stories on Planet Football. Instead, we feel obliged to write about our disappointment in Mauricio Pochettino.

In an interview from World Cup headquarters in Florida, USMNT manager Pochettino was asked about comments by Timothy Weah about the scandalous price of World Cup tickets.

“It is too expensive,” Weah told French outlet Le Dauphine. “Football should still be enjoyed by everyone. It is the most popular sport. This World Cup will be good, but it will be more of a show.

“I am just a bit disappointed by the ticket prices. Lots of real fans will miss matches.”

FIFA are charging up to $8,680 list price per ticket for the tournament and as much as $175 for parking spots.

Though there are more affordable markets, average ticket prices have been widely criticised, including supporter groups from around the world.

Now was the time for Pochettino to publicly back his own player or at least give a politician's answer of peace-keeping neutrality. Sadly, Poch's nose is as brown as his hair.

“First of all, I think players need to talk on the pitch, playing football, not outside of,” the ex-Spurs and Chelsea boss said, in a voice barely audible over the washing and soaping of hands.

“It is not [Weah's] duty to evaluate the price of the ticket. And then also my job, my duty is to prepare the team, the U.S. men's national team in the best way to perform.

“We are not politicians. We are sport people who can only we can talk about our job, and I think if FIFA does something or takes some decision, they know why, and [it] is their responsibility to explain why.

“But it is not about us to provide our opinion.

“Our responsibility is to perform, play and perform on the pitch and then the people that is in charge of the federation, maybe he can give his opinion, but I am the head coach of the federation.”

Yikes. The crate of lemons was supposed to absorb this negative energy, Poch.

The best-case scenario is that this was a pre-emptive measure to shut down any polarising social commentary. Players have eyes and brains, and are often asked questions. It's part of their jobs.

The second possible benefit is if he believes being nice to FIFA can help on the field.

We suppose it worked for South Korea back in 2002, a competition where Pochettino was part of the Argentina squad eliminated in the group stages.

The obvious counter-argument is that he did so in the worst way possible. The 53-year-old said far too many words to be given the benefit of any doubt regarding ulterior motives.

It was a clear example of the ‘shut up and dribble' retort used against LeBron James, as if people can only have opinions on things directly related to their job.

It's worth mentioning that Weah's dad is George Weah, the generational footballer who became President of Liberia between 2018 and 2024. ‘Sticking to football' has always been a feeble argument.

“I think for sure you need the media to ask directly to FIFA, and for sure, you're going to receive a very good answer, but no, it is not up to us to shush this type of thing,” Pochettino added.

“We need to be focusing on the sports side and trust in the organisation that is in charge of soccer or football around the world that they are going to do the right things.

“(FIFA) is doing an amazing job around the world uniting people.”

The snag? FIFA have consistently demonstrated their lack of interest in ‘doing the right things'. Oh, Poch.

We thought he was better than willfully serving as a useful idiot for one of the most corrupt organisations in the world. Discovering otherwise has ruined our Friday morning.

It will be hard enough for Pochettino to pick the 26-player squad. But it will be just as vital to decide how many players he'll take at each position. 

In a few months, U.S. men's soccer team manager Mauricio Pochettino will have to make some of the toughest choices he has ever made in his decorated coaching career.

It will be hard enough to pick the 26-player squad for a World Cup on home soil. But it be will just as vital to decide how many players he'll take at each position: centerback, outside back, the many kinds of midfielders, and forwards.

His life will be made a little easier by the number of goalkeepers being set by rule at three. But all those other choices will cause plenty of headaches, and debates among U.S. fans.

“It's difficult to now tell you if we are going to bring a number of centerbacks or fullbacks or strikers or midfielders,” he said in a news conference Thursday in Miami. “The way that we build the roster, it's always about having the possibility to be very flexible, to have the possibility also to change during the game.”

Pochettino alluded to the big tactical change he installed in the fall, switching from the program's longtime 4-3-3 setup to a 3-4-2-1. The switch sparked the team's five-game unbeaten run to end 2025, but it also posed new questions.

The biggest arguably is at centerback. That position can have a big effect on the overall balance because it changes the outside backs' playing style and takes a midfielder off the field.

Pochettino didn't address centerback directly, for the reason he noted above. But he did acknowledge that “if we want to play with fullbacks that go forward, we bring more forwards and less wingers.”

The injury list will also matter a lot, of course.

“Until we really know the possibilities of the players that we are going to have available, it's impossible to say if we are going to bring more or less” at any given position, Pochettino said. “It's a domino effect that if something changes, [it] sometimes affects another.”

He summed it up like this: “I think the combination is always going to be to first have the players available, and then [address] how we are going to approach, in the tactical way, the games.”

It would be natural for fans to expect the March squad, which will play star-studded Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta, to be a preview of the World Cup roster — not that it has to be all 26, but at least be on the way there.

Pochettino indicated he would like to think that way, too, but players' health comes first.

“It's true that now we are close to the World Cup, and it's true that it's going to be difficult to bring some new players because I think we don't have time,” he said. 

“But, already, we had time to assess all the players, more than 70 players that we saw during one year and a half — I think we have a very good idea. Now it's about to wish that our players will be fit and will be in very good form for us to select the right players to try to compete in our best way.”

Right back Alex Freeman could have a lot at stake in March. The 21-year-old son of former Eagles wide receiver Antonio Freeman made a $4 million move to Spain's Villarreal on Thursday. Villarreal currently is fourth in La Liga and was just eliminated from the Champions League.

It's a big bet for Freeman to make on himself so close to the tournament. Pochettino said the player asked for advice on the move, and the manager gladly gave some.

“I said, ‘You need to be very natural and take what you believe is the best option for you, for your family, and, of course, for your people that advise you,'” Pochettino said. 

“For sure, always for me, it's important that the player feels happy, feels comfortable, [but does] not to want to be in a comfort zone. This type of thing that happens is because they want to improve, they want to grow, and I think it's an amazing challenge that we need to support and help,” Pochettino said. 

Ricardo Pepi might be the next major American to change clubs. English Premier League club Fulham wants to buy the 23-year-old striker from the Netherlands' PSV Eindhoven and has upped the ante to $38 million to try to seal a deal this winter.

That's an even bigger gamble. Any striker needs to be playing and scoring regularly to secure a place on the U.S. depth chart, but Pepi was one of the closest cuts to miss the 2022 World Cup. 

Still, Pochettino backed the move.

“When you change, it's because you are convinced that you're going to be in a better place than the place that you are, no?” he said. “And I think that is why always I am very optimistic, I'm very positive on all the moves.”

Pochettino was asked about Tim Weah's recent remarks to French newspaper Le Dauphiné Liberé that ticket prices for this summer's World Cup are “too expensive.”

“Football should still be enjoyed by everyone,” said Weah, who plays for Marseille. “This World Cup will be good, but it will be more of a show. … I am just a bit disappointed by the ticket prices. Lots of real fans will miss matches.”

Pochettino's response got fans' attention, too.

“First of all, I think players need to talk on the pitch playing football,” he said. “It's not his duty to evaluate the price of the ticket. And then also, my job, my duty, is to prepare the U.S. men's national team in the best way to perform. We are no politician, we are sports people, that only we can talk about our job.”

The  prices  were set by FIFA, world soccer's governing body, and not by U.S. Soccer, which proposed considerably lower prices in its bid book.

“I think if FIFA does something or takes some decision, they know why, and it's their responsibility to explain why, but it's not to us to provide our opinion, our responsibility is to perform,” Pochettino said, coincidentally sitting in FIFA's Miami offices. 

“The person that is in charge of the federation, maybe he can give his opinion, but I am the head coach of the [U.S.] federation. And I think we have the organization that is over us, FIFA, that is doing an amazing job around the world, uniting people, because I think FIFA unites people.”

He added that “the media need to ask directly [to] FIFA, and for sure you are going to receive a very good answer.”

Cost overruns for Toronto and Vancouver are among the highest of all 16 cities co-hosting the World Cup in June. But unlike their American counterparts, they're not scaling back their plans for the soccer tournament – they've just increased the budget. 

All the host cities in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico are feeling the pressure of rising costs, much of it driven by inflation, an expanded tournament format, stadium upgrades required by FIFA and higher than expected security costs. 

But the response to these pressures has been different in Canada than in the U.S., because the Toronto and Vancouver host committees are publicly-funded extensions of their municipalities, while their American counterparts are private, non-profit organizations that can more easily fundraise or cut their budgets in the face of financial pressure. 

Mexico's model is different still, where soaring costs are being absorbed by a massive, multi-billion-dollar national infrastructure campaign designed to draw tourists to the country long-term.

Toronto's estimated cost to host FIFA's marquee event has grown from an estimated $30-million to $45-million in 2018 to $380-million today – roughly ten times what city councillors approved when they first supported a bid. Vancouver's estimated costs, meanwhile, have swelled from roughly $240-million in 2022 to $624-million shared between all three levels of government, according to the latest update from the province.

Politicians in both cities now swing between celebrating the tournament's global status and bemoaning its skyrocketing costs. 

“The World Cup is going to make a lot of money for a lot of people, but not for the City of Toronto or Vancouver,” Toronto city councillor Josh Matlow told The Globe and Mail. “There's no rational way to suggest that there's going to be a good return on investment when it comes to dollars and cents for our cities.”

Similar complaints are being heard in American host cities, but the rising costs there have not been on the same scale as those in Canada. One major difference is the U.S. host cities are using a model that isn't relying as heavily on public funds, and uses more private donors and local sponsorships in addition to whatever government dollars they can secure. Boston, for example, is raising tens of millions in corporate sponsorships to help pay for hosting costs expected to exceed USD$100-million. 

One response by U.S. World Cup host cities to rising costs has been to cut back on their obligations for fan festivals, part of their original commitment to FIFA to hold outdoor watch parties for large crowds during the entire length of the tournament. Under backlash from host cities, FIFA has quietly relaxed these requirements, and has allowed them to plan more affordable, smaller-scale festival celebrations. 

Seattle, where hosting costs are expected to be between US$45-million to US$65-million, is planning more limited fan festivals as a cost-saving measure - after dumping official FIFA FanFest branding events projected to cost US$1-million a day. Los Angeles, projected to spend more than USD$150-million on the World Cup, is running a shorter FIFA-approved celebration, before switching to smaller regional events operated outside the soccer federation's control. New York, meanwhile, has said it will charge people for entering its organized fan events.

When asked if they're cutting back on fan festival spending, Canada's two host cities said they had no immediate plans to scale down these free events, or move to more budget-friendly celebrations outside of FIFA's purview. 

Vancouver says it will share cost estimates this spring for its FanFest events, which will include live concerts, game broadcasts and “immersive” fan experiences – all taking place at the PNE Fairgrounds at Hastings Park, with space for 25,000 people.

“While we are watching other host cities, our responsibility is to make decisions based on the realities and opportunities that most benefit our local community. We are taking a disciplined approach to ensure we deliver the strongest possible outcome within budget, and the total number of operating days will reflect that,” Elayne Sun, a spokesperson for the City of Vancouver, told The Globe.

She added that the city can offset some of those costs by selling premium tickets to FanFest events, which will include elevated seating, as well as food and commercial partnerships. 

Sharon Bollenbach, executive director of Toronto's bid committee, meanwhile, said the city can't yet share an estimate for its FanFest costs, but “more details will be shared as plans are solidified.”

Toronto's mayor Olivia Chow has questioned how the city wound up contractually obligated to host the World Cup when its costs are rising out of its control. Other cities, such as Chicago, Minneapolis and Calgary, walked away early in the bid stage when they lost their appetite to meet FIFA's financial requirements. Montreal, meanwhile, dropped its bid when the Quebec provincial government withdrew financial support, saying the budget would have been difficult to justify.

Toronto's city council first directed its deputy city manager to consider a joint bid to co-host the 2026 World Cup in April, 2014. Nearly four years later, it still didn't have a memorandum of understanding with other levels of government to share hosting costs. That meant the city had to bid to host the tournament before it had any commitment from the province or the federal government that they would support it financially, according to a June report from the city's auditor general.

Ontario later committed up to $97-million, but as much of a third of that will be in the form of provincial services, not cash. Mr. Matlow says it's all left the city in a compromised position as it's moved forward with a plan to host – something former mayor John Tory called a “once in a generation opportunity to showcase Toronto to the world” in January, 2018.

“It was more than a risk. It was irresponsible and reckless and should never have happened,” the councillor said.

One of the largest costs to Toronto is the $123-million needed to upgrade city-owned BMO Field to meet FIFA's strict requirements for World Cup games. Those renovations, which will add 15,000 temporary seats to the 30,000-seat stadium, will include four new videoboards and upgrades to the stadium's hospitality suites, locker rooms, lighting, audio and broadcast infrastructure. Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Toronto FC and the Toronto Argonauts, is contributing $23-million to the upgrades at BMO Field.

Other World Cup host cities, such as Miami, didn't have to take on major stadium renovations because they had NFL facilities big enough to meet FIFA's requirements. Miami's stadium, home to the Miami Dolphins, seats 65,000 people and has already hosted eight games during the FIFA Club World Cup 2025. Miami‑Dade County's official hosting cost estimate is around USD$46-million.

Vancouver's host stadium, the 54,000-seat B.C. Place, is also undergoing major renovations to meet FIFA requirements for hosting matches – including installing a temporary natural grass pitch. But unlike Toronto, which is paying for upgrades out of municipal coffers, the $196-million for stadium upgrades in Vancouver is coming from the provincial government. That's because BC Place is owned by a provincial Crown corporation, and belongs to the British Columbia government.

Vancouver's host committee says inflation and security expenses have been the biggest sources of its cost increases since 2022, the year it was confirmed as one of 16 host cities. The city's projected costs, estimated to be over $600-million, are now among the highest of all host locations in the tournament. 

To help pay for the games, the City of Vancouver introduced a Major Events Municipal and Regional District Tax of 2.5 per cent on short-term accommodations. The city said the tax, which came into effect on Feb. 1, 2023, could generate $230-million over seven years. The province estimates the tournament could draw 350,000 spectators to BC Place.

While Ontario premier Doug Ford has balked at giving more World Cup funds to Toronto, B.C. Premier David Eby has doubled down on his support for the tournament's costs, saying more games in Vancouver “would not only be possible, but they would be incredibly welcome.” Vancouver is hosting seven games, while Toronto has six. 

FIFA, meanwhile, defends the high cost of hosting, arguing there is a long-term return that will benefit host cities. According to the soccer federation's own assessment, Canada will see $3.8-billion in positive economic output, including $2-billion in GDP, $1.3-billion in labour income and 24,100 jobs created between 2023 and 2026.

A look at past World Cups raises questions about whether these investments truly pay off, however. Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based thinktank, said 12 of the last 14 World Cups hosted since 1966 have resulted in financial losses for their host countries. The last three World Cups have had an average negative return on investment of 31 per cent, according to a recent report from the group.

“FIFA justifies these high costs and lofty demands with the promise of economic returns. It says North American cities will receive a huge influx of tourists eager to spend their money on hotels, restaurants, and other parts of the local economy which will make up for the lost revenues,” the report's author, Page Gray, said.

“Other countries' experiences are less convincing.”

The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) says it remains optimistic that FIFA will rule in its favour concerning the petition against the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) over the eligibility of players used in November's World Cup play-off final, Soccernet.ng reports.

Nigeria's hopes of reaching the 2026 FIFA World Cup were dealt a heavy blow when the Super Eagles lost on penalties to DR Congo at the Moulay Hassan Stadium. It was a result that appeared to condemn them to a second consecutive absence from the global tournament.

However, weeks after that defeat, the NFF confirmed it had formally approached FIFA, alleging that DR Congo breached regulations by fielding ineligible players during the decisive fixture.

FIFA has remained silent over the matter, with Nigeria and DR Congo keen to know the final decision of the football-governing body.

There have been criticisms, including from former Super Eagles captain and coach Sunday Oliseh, aimed at the NFF for its attempt to claim victory over DR Congo via administrative technicalities rather than on the pitch.

But the NFF insists it is not on a wild goose chase.

Speaking on the matter, NFF General Secretary Dr Sanusi Mohammed said the federation would not have pursued the case without confidence in its position.

“We have a good case,” Sanusi told Brila.net. “We don't venture into what we know is an exercise in futility.”

Sanusi added that Nigeria's complaint is still being reviewed by world football's governing body and that the federation is waiting patiently for a response.

“As far as we are concerned we have a good case and we are waiting for what FIFA will say as regards to the complaints we have logged.”

The NFF's argument is based on claims that DR Congo fielded players who allegedly breached FIFA rules on eligibility, particularly around dual nationality. DR Congo have strongly denied any wrongdoing and, for now, retain their place as Africa's representatives in the inter-confederation play-offs.

FIFA has yet to announce a date for its verdict, leaving the situation unresolved just two months before the next stage of the qualification process.

Under the current arrangement, DR Congo are set to compete in the inter-confederation play-off tournament scheduled for 26 and 31 March 2026 in Mexico. The mini-tournament will decide two final qualification places for the World Cup, which will be hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Alongside DR Congo, the six-team competition features Iraq, Jamaica, Suriname, New Caledonia and Bolivia. The Congolese side are due to face the winner of the tie between New Caledonia and Jamaica.

However, that line-up could still change.

Should FIFA uphold Nigeria's petition, the Super Eagles could yet be reinstated and handed a late route back into contention for a place at the 2026 World Cup.

Mauricio Pochettino didn't seem interested in commenting on one of the most-talked-about issues of the upcoming World Cup — the sky-high ticket prices fans are being forced to shell out to attend matches. 

The U.S. Men's National Team head coach said during a conference call Thursday that “it is not up to us to judge” the ticket pricing situation for the World Cup and that he and his players focus on “our job.” 

Pochettino was asked for his thoughts on concerns that ticket prices, which range from several hundred to several thousand dollars to attend matches, were too unaffordable and about comments from winger Tim Weah that he was “disappointed” by costs.

“First of all, I think players need to talk on the pitch, playing football, not outside of the [pitch],” the USMNT coach said. “It is not his duty to evaluate the price of the ticket. And then also my duty is to prepare the team, the U.S. Men's National Team, in the best way to perform. We are not politicians. We are sport people that only we can talk about our job. And I think if FIFA does something or takes some decision, they know why, and it is their responsibility to explain why. But it's not up to us to provide our opinion.

“Our responsibility is to perform, play and perform on the pitch. And then the people that [are] in charge of the federation, maybe he can give his opinion, but I am the head coach of the federation. And I think we have the organization that is over us, that is FIFA, that is doing an amazing job around the world uniting people, because I think FIFA unites people. I think for sure the media need to ask directly to FIFA, and for sure you are going to receive a very good answer. But no, it is not up to us to judge this type of thing. We need to be focused on the sports side, and trust in the organization that is in charge of soccer or football around the world, that they are going to do the right things.”

Weah told French outlet Le Dauphiné that World Cup tickets were “too expensive.” 

“Football should still be enjoyed by everyone. It is the most popular sport. This World Cup will be good, but it will be more of a show,” he told the outlet.

“I am just a bit disappointed by the ticket prices. Lots of real fans will miss matches.”

The cost of tickets at the World Cup is an increasingly charged topic that has drawn condemnation from fans across the soccer world, including from New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani.

In an attempt to curb some of the negative comments, FIFA cut ticket prices for some of the participating nations' most loyal fans down to $60. 

The number of $60 tickets ranges from 400 to 750 per team, and it will be up to the national federations to determine how to distribute the tickets. 

Even with the high prices, it appears that tickets for the upcoming tournament, being jointly hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, are still in high demand.

FIFA World Cup 2026 Executive Director of Commercial Operations Ross McCall told The California Post this week that they've received more than 500 million applications for tickets to World Cup matches. 

McCall told the outlet that FIFA is making “about 6.8 million” tickets available for purchase at face value, which has led to the astronomical ticket prices on the secondary market, with the Associated Press reporting last week that a ticket for the final at MetLife Stadium had been listed for more than $200,000.

Licence fee payers' money will not be used this summer

Micah Richards will be on The Rest is Football podcast

The BBC has made clear it will not use licence fee payers' money to help leading pundits such as Micah Richards to work for rival podcasts during this summer's World Cup.

Cost constraints and environmental considerations mean the BBC's World Cup presentation will come from its Salford studios for the bulk of the tournament, with Richards expected to have a leading role. However, he has also committed to appearing on The Rest is Football podcast, which will be presented by Gary Lineker in New York.

During Euro 2024 the then BBC trio of Lineker, Richards and Alan Shearer recorded episodes of The Rest is Football together in Berlin, but the BBC's decision to stay at home and Lineker's split from the corporation last year have created issues in terms of filming together during the World Cup.

In another complication, The Rest is Football is expected to be shot to higher production standards this summer owing to a distribution deal with Netflix, which will be making the podcast available on its platforms after a £14m deal agreed last month.

Netflix's deal with Lineker's production company, Goalhanger, is understood to include a commitment to produce more than 40 Rest is Football video podcasts during the World Cup, which the streaming platform will want to feature as many big-name guests as possible.

Lineker will be in Netflix's New York studio throughout, with other pundits to join him when they are available. The BBC has told its pundits that it is happy for them to do other media work during the World Cup and many are expected to do so, but it will not subsidise the cost. As a result Richards's travel costs will have to be met by Netflix or Goalhanger.

Shearer will be in the US throughout the tournament on co-commentary duties for the BBC, so there is more chance of him presenting The Rest is Football alongside Lineker in person.

The Match of the Day presenters Mark Chapman, Kelly Cates and Gabby Logan will be based in the Salford studio for the bulk of the World Cup, although one or more of them may travel to the US later in the tournament, particularly if England or Scotland reach the latter stages.

The trio will also have podcasting duties during the World Cup as presenters of The Sports Agents, which is expected to record its programmes remotely.

The BBC chose to base its World Cup coverage in the UK in part because the huge travel distances involved would affect its commitment to reduce its carbon footprint.

The expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams, resulting in an increase from 64 to 104 matches, has also influenced its thinking. Despite this rise the BBC's matches will be shown on its main channels rather than on iPlayer, with UK rights shared with ITV.

The BBC and The Rest is Football declined to comment.

Novak Djokovic turned back the clock once more in the early hours of Saturday morning at the Australian Open, where he snapped his five-match losing streak against Jannik Sinner in a five-set epic to move within one victory of a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title and an 11th in Melbourne.

Having dropped the opening set and then slipped two sets to one behind, the recent familiar narrative threatened to repeat itself for Djokovic, who lost in the semi-finals at all four majors in 2025. This time, however, the 38-year-old refused to yield, saving 16 of the 18 break points he faced in the four-hour and nine-minute thriller. Red-lining under the lights on Rod Laver Arena, he dragged himself back into the clash and outlasted the two-time defending champion 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in a gripping semi-final battle.

“I am lost for words right now, to be honest,” said Djokovic, who is in his first major final since Wimbledon 2024. “It feels surreal to be honest. Playing for over four hours, it is nearly 2 am. Reminiscing about 2012 when I played Rafa in the final and that was almost six hours. The level of intensity and the quality of tennis was extremely high and I knew that was the only way for me to win tonight against him. He won the past five matches against me. He had my mobile number, so I had to change my number for tonight.

“Jokes aside, I told him at the net, thanks for letting me have at least one [win]. I have tremendous respect for him, an incredible player. He pushes you to the very limit, which is what he did tonight to me, so he deserves a great round of applause... Tonight has been one of the best nights, if not the best night, atmosphere and support-wise, I have had in Australia.”

NOT. DONE. YET! 🤯@DjokerNole #AO26 pic.twitter.com/nfZo4EPMP8

It marked Djokovic's first five-set match since Roland Garros in 2024, when he survived against Francisco Cerundolo. Awaiting Djokovic in Sunday's final is rival Carlos Alcaraz, who earlier endured the longest semi-final in Australian Open history, a five-hour, 27-minute marathon against Alexander Zverev, to reach his first championship match in Melbourne.

"I did watch [Alcaraz-Zverev]. I was very eager to get out on the court. What an incredible match," Djokovic said. "We tried to match that quality and intensity, but credit to both of those guys, battling it out. I saw Carlos after the match and he told me 'I am sorry to delay the start of your match', and I told him I am an old man and I need to go earlier to sleep. I am looking forward to seeing him in a few days."

Djokovic has not lifted a major trophy since the US Open in 2023, a drought underscored by the dominance of Sinner and Alcaraz, who have shared the past eight majors between them. The Italian and Spaniard had also contested the previous three Grand Slam finals, but Djokovic tore up that script on Friday, denying them the chance to become just the second pair in the Open Era to meet in four consecutive major finals, after Djokovic and Rafael Nadal between Wimbledon 2011 and Roland Garros 2012.
The Serbian will carry a narrow 5-4 Lexus ATP Head2Head advantage over Alcaraz into Sunday's final, having beaten the Spaniard in the quarter-finals in Melbourne 12 months ago. Buoyed by his proactive, ruthless display against Sinner, Djokovic will also enter the title match the fresher of the two, having spent less time on court through a unique path to the final.

Djokovic won his opening three matches in straight sets, benefited from a fourth-round walkover against Jakub Mensik and advanced again when Lorenzo Musetti retired while leading by two sets in the quarter-finals. Into his 38th major final following his win, Djokovic is the oldest man in the Open Era to reach the Australian Open final. The No. 4 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has now earned a record 104 wins at the major, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Roger Federer is second on the list with 102.
In front of an electric Rod Laver Arena crowd, Sinner showed exactly why he had won his previous five meetings with Djokovic in the first set, producing a composed and authoritative display in the opener. The Italian struck 15 winners to Djokovic's eight and dictated the majority of the baseline exchanges to take control.
Djokovic responded with urgency at the start of the second set, clawing back momentum. The 38-year-old converted his fourth break-point opportunity to move ahead 3–1, striking with renewed aggression and pinpoint accuracy down the line to force Sinner out of position and level the match.

Sinner wrestled back the initiative in the third, using his touch and variation to outmanoeuvre Djokovic while winning an imposing 90 per cent (18/20) of his first-serve points. Yet the Serbian refused to fade. In the fourth set, Djokovic penetrated Sinner's defences with increasingly proactive hitting, upping the pace on his forehand beyond 140 km/h and saving two crucial break points at 4-3 to drag the contest into a deciding fifth set.
Djokovic then showcased why he is the champion he is in a tense decider. The 101-time tour-level titlist continued to swing away in the fifth set and saved all eight break points he faced, including three from 0/40 at 4-3. He conjured up some magic of his own on return to find the key breakthrough in the seventh game before holding out for a remarkable win.
Djokovic failed to convert either of his first two match points, with Sinner scrambling to stay alive on the backhand side to bring the scores back to deuce. However, it was third time lucky for the 38-year-old, who dropped to his knees shortly after sealing victory.
"It already feels like winning tonight, but I know I will have to come back in a couple of days and fight the number 1 in the world," Djokovic said looking ahead to the final. "I hope I have enough gas to stay toe-to-toe with him, that is my desire."

It is the first time since Wimbledon 2018 that both men's semi-finals have gone to five sets.

 Carlos Alcaraz had to rouse every last ounce of energy to overcome Alexander Zverev on Friday in an Australian Open classic. After five hours and 27 minutes of back-and-forth semi-final action inside Rod Laver Arena, the Spaniard's focus quickly turned to physical recovery for Sunday's championship match. 

 The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Alcaraz struggled with an injury in his upper right leg from the closing stages of the third set of his 6-4, 7-6(5), 6-7(3), 6-7(4), 7-5 triumph against Zverev. He later revealed he thought the problem was with his adductor muscle but expressed confidence that he would be raring to go for the title match against Jannik Sinner or Novak Djokovic. 

 “Well, obviously I feel tired,” said Alcaraz, who would become the youngest man to complete the Career Grand Slam by lifting his maiden Australian Open title on Sunday, in his post-match press conference. “Obviously my body could be better, to be honest, but I think that's normal after five hours and a half. [After the match] I just did whatever it takes just to try to be better, to feel better tomorrow. Ice bath… I'm going to have treatment with the physio now, and we will see. 

 “Hopefully it's not going to be nothing at all, but after five-hours-and-a-half match and that high level of physically, I think the muscles are going to be tight, and I just got to do whatever it takes to be as good as I can for the final.”

 Against Zverev, Alcaraz could barely run for the tail end of the third set and much of the fourth, but loosened up in time to rally back from 3-5 in the decider to prevail in the longest semi-final in Australian Open history. 

 “This one was one of the more demanding matches that I have ever played in my career so far,” said the 22-year-old. “I think physically we just pushed each other to the limit today. We pushed our bodies to the limit. I think the level of the fifth set was really, really high. 

 “I'm just really, really happy to get the win, that I came back. I rank this one in the top position, [among] one of the best matches that I have ever won.” 

 Alcaraz is now 15-1 in fifth sets, and he has become the youngest man to reach the final at all four Grand Slam events. If he wants to go on to complete the Career Grand Slam on Sunday, he may need to reproduce some of the remarkable battling qualities he showcased to overcome Zverev. 

 “When I was younger, there were a lot of matches that I just didn't want to fight anymore or just I gave up,” said the six-time major champion. “Then I just got mature, and I just hate that feeling… Every step more, even just one second more of suffering, one second more of fighting is always worth it. So that's why I just fight until the last ball and always believe that I can come back in every situation.”

 Carlos Alcaraz advanced to his maiden Australian Open final in dramatic fashion on Friday afternoon, when he overcame physical problems and rallied from the brink to secure a marathon semi-final win against Alexander Zverev. 

The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Alcaraz overcame World No. 3 Zverev 6-4, 7-6(5), 6-7(3), 6-7(4), 7-5 after a pulsating five hours, 27 minutes inside Rod Laver Arena, the longest semi-final in tournament history. After appearing to recover from the upper right leg injury that hampered him from late in the third set, the Spaniard rallied from 3-5 in the decider and collapsed to the ground in ecstasy after sealing his first final appearance in Melbourne. He will take on Jannik Sinner or Novak Djokovic on Sunday for the trophy. 

“Believing, all the time,” said Alcaraz in his on-court interview, when asked how he won the match. “I always say you have to believe in yourself, no matter if you are struggling or what you have been through. No matter about anything, you still have to believe in yourself all the time. I was struggling in the middle of the third set. Physically it was one of the most demanding matches that I have played in my short career.

“I have been in these kinds of situations and I knew what I had to do. I had to put my heart into the match. I think I did it and I fought until the last ball. I knew I was going to have my chances. I am extremely proud of myself with the way that I fought and came back in the fifth set.”

 With his victory, Alcaraz moved to within one win of becoming the youngest man to complete the Career Grand Slam (winning the singles title at all four majors). Standing between Alcaraz and that piece of history, however, is a heavyweight showdown with one of his great rivals. World No. 2 Sinner is the two-time defending champion at Melbourne Park, while Djokovic is a record 10-time Australian Open titlist. 

Alcaraz is the youngest man in the Open Era to reach the final at all four majors and the 22-year-old Spaniard could now face Sinner in a fourth consecutive major title showdown. Into his eighth championship major match, the top seed will seek his seventh major on Sunday.

“I am really happy to play my first final in Melbourne,” Alcaraz said. “It was something I was chasing a lot, pursuing a lot. Having the chance to fight for the title. I think it has been a great tournament so far and my level is increasing a lot. But one thing I think I am going to say is I could not be here doing this interview right now without [the fans]. It was a pleasure playing in front of all of you. The way you pushed me back in the match... I am really grateful for the support.”

Alcaraz won 78 per cent (35/45) of points at the net in his epic win, according to Infosys Stats. The 22-year-old is now 15-1 in fifth sets, while he has also taken a 7-6 lead in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Zverev. Meanwhile, Friday's agonising defeat leaves the 28-year-old Zverev still chasing his maiden Grand Slam title. The German, who was just three points from victory, was aiming to reach his fourth slam final and second consecutive in Melbourne.



Alcaraz, who had not dropped a set across his opening five matches in Melbourne, appeared on course to maintain his perfect run after opening a two-set lead against Zverev. The top seed produced typically classy tennis when he needed it most, particularly when he rallied from 2-5 to clinch the second set. 

 It was at 4-4, 15/15 in the third set when the real drama began. Alcaraz appeared to pull up and struggle with an upper right leg injury when serving at 4-4 in the third set. He twice received treatment from the tournament physio, and he was unable to stop Zverev from clawing his way back into the match from there. 

Alcaraz's approach of playing ultra-aggressively to shorten rallies was competitive, but it appeared not to be enough. Zverev broke his opponent's serve in the opening game of the deciding set and, after fending off five break points across three of his service games, was soon serving for the match at 5-4. 

Then came Alcaraz's scarcely believable comeback. Moving freely again, the Spaniard reeled off four games in a row to stun his rival and become the youngest man to reach the final at all four Grand Slams. On match point, Alcaraz powered a forehand pass low into the encroaching Zverev, before falling to his back in ecstasy as the German's volley dropped into the net.

So near, yet so far again for Alexander Zverev in his quest for major glory. The third-seeded German was just three points away from defeating Carlos Alcaraz in their Australian Open semi-final on Friday night, but was unable to close it out as Alcaraz rallied from 3-5 down in the fifth set to triumph.

In the aftermath of the five-hour, 27-minute loss, the longest semi-final in tournament history, a fatigued Zverev reflected on his latest Grand Slam heartbreak.

“Unbelievable fight, battle. Unfortunate ending for me, but to be honest, I had absolutely nothing left in me,” Zverev said.

“To be honest, I think I'm way too tired to have emotions right now, so like in two days, I'll probably have more, but right now I'm just exhausted,” the German later continued. “I think we both went to our absolute limits, so somewhat I'm also proud of myself, the way I was hanging on and came back from two sets to love.

"Of course it's disappointing, but this is the start of the year, so if I continue playing that way, if I continue training the way I train, if I continue working on the things that I've been working in the offseason, I do believe it's going to be a good year for me.”

Zverev was chasing a fourth major final and a second consecutive Australian Open title match. Having rallied from two sets down, the 28-year-old looked poised to complete the comeback and hand Alcaraz just a second defeat in a fifth set.
However, the 28-year-old's post-match regrets did not come from his inability to serve out at 5-4 but his lack of ruthlessness more than three hours earlier in the second set.
“The second set, that one, I felt like I should have won,” Zverev said. “Especially serving for it, I didn't play a good game serving for it. Funny enough, I don't have many regrets in the fifth set, because I was hanging on for dear life, to be honest. I was exhausted. But the second set. I think going up, being one set all, and him starting to cramp in the third set, that probably would have made a difference.”

Alcaraz struggled with physical issues deep in the third set but found a way to dig in during an exhilarating fifth set. The Spaniard now holds a 15-1 record in matches that have gone the distance but this was not a factor Zverev was overly concerned about during the decider.
“I know my five-set record is quite good, as well. But, no, of course not," Zverev said. "It's not something you think about 5-4 serving. I had other thoughts in my mind. Basically I didn't want to fall over in the match.
“No, it's not something I think about, but I know that he's fit, I know that he's very, very strong and hard to beat in long matches. He's proven that last year in Paris, I think, as well against Jannik. I always feel like on the physical side I'm quite okay as well.”
Alcaraz now leads Zverev 7-6 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series and will face Jannik Sinner or Novak Djokovic in Sunday's final.

After about two hours on court it looked like things were headed in one direction in the first semifinal on Friday, after Alcaraz took the first set on the strength of one break in the ninth game, then rallied from a break down at 5-2 to clinch the second set in a tie-break, going up two sets to none.He was even two points from closing out the match late in the third set, during Zverev's 4-5 and 5-6 service games.But he began struggling with cramping during the second set and Zverev eventually pounced, sneaking out the third and fourth sets in tie-breaks. The German then broke in the opening game of the fifth set, which looked like the final nail in the coffin.Alcaraz got to break point in three of Zverev's service games in a row, at 2-1, 3-2 and 4-3, but he just couldn't convert, and he soon found himself down 5-3 in the decider, serving to stay in it.But the world No. 1 held to close in to 4-5, and then he finally broke through, breaking Zverev in the next game to make it 5-all. He then held for 6-5 and broke again to close out the match after a ridiculous five hours and 27 minutes on court.

Fittingly, Alcaraz's on-court interviewer after the match was Courier, the man whose record he had just broken. His first question: 'How in the world did you win this tennis match?'"Believing. Believing, all the time," Alcaraz replied."I always say that you have to believe in yourself, no matter what struggles you've been through, no matter anything. You've still got to believe in yourself, all the time."I was struggling in the middle of the third set. Physically, it was one of the most demanding matches I have ever played in my short career, I would say. But I've been in these situations, I've been in these kinds of matches before, so I knew what I had to do. I had to put my heart into the match. I think I did it. I fought until the last ball, I knew that I was going to have my chances."I'm just extremely proud of myself and the way that I fought, and the way that I came back in the fifth set."

On Sunday, he'll play the winner of the second semifinal between Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic to capture the only Grand Slam title missing from his trophy cabinet."I'm just really happy to have the chance to play my first final here in Melbourne," the six-time Grand Slam champion said. "It's something that I was pursuing a lot, chasing a lot, having the chance to fight for the title. I think it's been a great two weeks so far. I think my level has been increasing a lot."He then gave a shout-out to a few (thousand) people."But one thing that I've got to say—I couldn't stay here right now doing this interview without these guys," he said, gesturing to the crowd. "It was, for me, a real pleasure playing in front of all of you. The way you pushed me back into the match, the way you pushed me every time, every ball, every point, it's crazy."I'm just very grateful for the support, not only in this match, but during the whole tournament. So hopefully on Sunday it's going to be a great atmosphere, a great support. So I just can't wait."But obviously right now my head is about recovering as much as I can," he added, "just to try to be in a good state to put a show for you guys, and see you on Sunday, I guess."

O'Hara died Friday after a brief illness.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	Catherine O'Hara, a gifted comedic actress and two-time Emmy winner, has died. 


	O'Hara died Friday at her home in Los Angeles after a brief illness, her reps at CAA confirmed. She was 71.




	A native of Toronto, O'Hara was part of the SCTV ensemble that also helped launch the careers of John Candy, Eugene Levy, Rick Moranis and others. She's arguably best known for playing Kevin's (Macaulay Culkin) mother, Kate, in the Home Alone movies and had a career renaissance in the past 10 years with Schitt's Creek — winning an Emmy for her role as a faded soap opera actress opposite old friend Levy — and The Studio, for which she earned an Emmy nomination last year.

	She won an Emmy in 2020 for playing Moira Rose in Schitt's Creek. She also earned an Emmy for her work on SCTV Network in 1982 and was nominated eight other times for acting and writing awards. O'Hara was a double nominee in 2025, scoring anod best guest actress in a drama series for HBO's The Last of Us along with her comedic turn in The Studio.


	O'Hara was born March 4, 1954, and grew up in Toronto. She joined the city's Second City company at age 20, first serving as an understudy to Gilda Radner and moving up to the main cast when Radner left to become part of the original Saturday Night Live ensemble. 


	In 1976, the troupe launched SCTV, a sketch comedy show that originally aired on Canada's Global network. The show's initial cast, all of whom were writers as well, featured a murderer's row of comic talent in Candy, Joe Flaherty, Levy, Andrea Martin, O'Hara, Harold Ramis and Dave Thomas; Moranis joined later in the show's run, as did Martin Short. NBC later picked up the show to run in the United States.

	











	O'Hara would go on to play the overbearing Delia Deetz in Tim Burton's Beetlejuice (a role she reprised in the 2024 sequel Beetlejuice Beetlejuice) before being cast in 1990's Home Alone, the now holiday classic where she plays Kate McCallister, a mother who races back from a Paris Christmas trip after realizing the family left their 8-year-old son, Kevin (Culkin), behind. She played Kate once more in the sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.


	She became part of Christopher Guest's regular ensemble in the films Waiting for Guffman (1996), Best in Show (2000), A Mighty Wind (2003) and For Your Consideration (2006). O'Hara earned an Emmy nomination for her supporting role in HBO's 2010 film Temple Grandin.


	With Schitt's Creek, co-created by Eugene Levy and son Dan, O'Hara won a new generation of fans for her role as Moira, who rails at the formerly wealthy Rose family's diminished circumstances. The show swept the comedy categories at the 2020 Emmys, winning best comedy series and acting honors for O'Hara, Dan Levy, Eugune Levy and Annie Murphy. 


	The show became a breakout hit in its later seasons on Canada's CBC, Pop TV in the U.S. and streaming on Netflix, in addition to its awards haul. “There's so many projects that get a ton of attention right at the beginning, maybe before they're even quite ready for it, and then it's kind of downhill attention-wise from there,” O'Hara told The Hollywood Reporter after her 2020 nomination. “We're so lucky to do the show we wanted and, apparently, leaving people wanting more. I'm happy to be a late bloomer, I always have been in my life and I'm grateful for it.”

	











	What turned out to be O'Hara's final series role came in The Studio, Apple TV's Hollywood satire in which she played deposed studio head Patty Leigh, who alternately relishes in and sympathizes with her replacement Matt Remick's (Seth Rogen) struggles. She had been set to continue her role in the show's second season, which began filming in mid-January.


	O'Hara is survived by her husband, Bo Welch, sons Matthew and Luke, along with siblings Michael O'Hara, Mary Margaret O'Hara, Maureen Jolley, Marcus O‘Hara, Tom O'Hara and Patricia Wallice.

Catherine O'Hara — the beloved Canadian comic actress best known for her roles in the films of Christopher Guest, the “Home Alone” movies, “Schitt's Creek,” and many more — has died. She was 71. The news was confirmed to IndieWire by her agents at CAA. She died at her home in Los Angeles on January 30, 2026 after a brief illness.

O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch and sons Matthew and Luke. The acclaimed actress was born in Toronto but died in Los Angeles, where she had lived throughout the last few decades of her career.

 










O'Hara was most recently seen on the big screen reprising the role of Delia Deetz in “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” the sequel to Tim Burton's 1988 “Beetlejuice.” She also starred in Season 2 of HBO's “The Last of Us” as a hard-drinking therapist to survivors of a zombie apocalypse and in Season 1 of “The Studio” as exiled Hollywood executive Patty Leigh.

But she's perhaps best known for her roles in Christopher Guest films like “A Mighty Wind” and “Best in Show,” and, of course, the “Home Alone” movies, where she played the frazzled mother to Macaulay Culkin's perennially missing Kevin McAllister.

 










She earned Emmy nominations for “The Last of Us” and “The Studio” and won a primetime Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as hilariously deluded, struggling actress Moira Rose in the Canadian show “Schitt's Creek.” Other credits include a laugh-out-loud funny stint on “Curb Your Enthusiasm” as Bam Bam, plus Martin Scorsese's “After Hours,” Mike Nichols' “Heartburn,” Spike Jonze's “Where the Wild Things Are,” Sam Mendes' “Away We Go,” the animated favorite “Nightmare Before Christmas,” and more.

O'Hara collaborated with Christopher Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy four times on the critically acclaimed mockumentary films “Waiting for Guffman,” “Best in Show,” “A Mighty Wind,” and “For Your Consideration.” Her performance in the latter won her the 2007 National Board of Review Award for Supporting Actress.

Catherine O'Hara launched her career as a star of “Second City Television,” aka “SCTV,” the Canadian sketch show that also featured Eugene Levy, John Candy, Rick Moranis, and more familiar faces in comedy. Her breakout screen role was as an ice-cream truck driver in Scorsese's “After Hours,” which led to roles like in “Beetlejuice” as the pretentious sculpture-art collector Delia, or in Warren Beatty's “Dick Tracy,” or of course, the “Home Alone” movies. She starred in the 1990 original and in 1992's “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York” as a mother who became the heart of the story, stressing about her son Kevin's whereabouts, but funny on her own terms.

 










Her roles in Guest's films announced her as a big-screen comedic talent to watch, whether in “Best in Show” as middle-class Floridian Mayflower kennel club entrant Cookie Fleck (“this tastes like cafeteria hot-plate food”) or in “For Your Consideration” as Academy Award-bidding actress Marilyn Heck, who doesn't receive a nomination (“I wasn't nominated! I'm not gonna lose!”). She's also side-splittingly hilarious as Bam Bam in Season 7 of HBO's “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” as the mentally disabled sister to Marty Funkhouse (played by late actor Bob Einstein). A role that perhaps would not be assigned today.

Looking back, she was also outrageously funny in Jake Kasdan's 2002 middling comedy “Orange County”; she could elevate any material. In that film, she played another stressed-out mother, here to Colin Hanks, who is heading off to college while she's stuck at home in an unfulfilling second marriage. Her panic at Hanks' character beginning to flee the nest is pure comic genius.

Her turn as outré onscreen diva Moira Rose in Eugene and Dan Levy's Canadian sitcom “Schitt's Creek” turned her into a star for a new generation. In that show, which won her a best actress Emmy, she perfectly embodies a too-into-herself failed actress scrambling for a new role, and often decked out in ridiculously over-the-top fashion.

 










Along with Emmys for “Schitt's Creek” and “SCTV,” she also won a Golden Globe (for “Schitt's Creek” in 2020) and two SAG Awards (for the same show). It's hard to think of a more beloved comic screen actress who was still working today. She was nominated for a New York Film Critics Circle Award for her role in “For Your Consideration” — she didn't win it. 

Much like her character in Christopher Guest's film, she couldn't lose.

Like many world and business leaders and would-be Orlando vacationers, Queen guitarist Brian May is thinking twice about crossing the pond these days. Amid mounting state violence, threats of immigrant detention, and civilian executions, May tells the Daily Mail that touring the States again has given him pause because “America is a dangerous place at the moment, so you have to take that into account.” Since July, masked state agents have been involved in eight fatalities, including the shooting deaths of Alex Pretti, Renée Good, and Keith Porter earlier this year. Meanwhile, the Trump administration's masked police force has arrested more than 352,000 people, cramming them in inhumane detention centers, before shipping detainees, including children, to countries they've often never been to before. Particularly in cities such as Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Portland, ME, things continue to escalate, and today, they began arresting journalists. “It's very sad because I feel like Queen grew up in America and we love it, but it's not what it was,” May says. “Everyone is thinking twice about going there at the moment.” Since 2009, May and Queen drummer Roger Taylor has toured with singer Adam Lambert under the name Queen + Adam Lambert. They last played America in 2023.

May didn't speak to any particular reason why he feels America is becoming a dangerous place, though an increasingly violent secret police force that's hostile to immigrants seems as good a reason as any to avoid a country. The guitarist's personal politics have drifted left over the last few decades, particularly as the U.K.'s Conservative Party moved toward the isolationism of Brexit. He's particularly engaged with animal welfare, and per Stereogum, refused to play Glastonbury Festival because, he claims, its founders “like killing badgers, and they think it's for sport and that's something I cannot support because we've been trying to save these badgers for years.”

“Schitt's Creek” star Catherine O'Hara has died. She was 71.

“Prolific multi-award-winning actress, writer, and comedian Catherine O'Hara died today at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness,” her agency, Creative Artists Agency, confirmed in a statement to Page Six on Friday.

The Los Angeles Fire Department told us exclusively that they responded to a call to the beloved acting icon's home at 4:48 a.m. local time before transporting her to the hospital in “serious” condition.

TMZ was the first to report the news. O'Hara's cause of death remains unclear.

She is survived by her husband of 33 years, Bob Welch, and their two sons, Matthew, 31, and Luke, 29.

Born in 1954 in Toronto, Canada, O'Hara was one of seven children. 

After graduating high school in 1973, O'Hara began working as a waitress at the legendary Second City improv comedy hub in Toronto before landing a spot as Gilda Radner's understudy.

She went on to become a main cast member the following year when Radner left “Saturday Night Live.”

“Once I saw the Second City show, I thought, ‘Oh my Lord, that is what I want to do. This is what I am meant to do. Please let me in,'” O'Hara told Playback in 2008. “Waitressing seemed like a fun way to watch the show for free every night.”

O'Hara later served as a founding cast member of “Second City Television” (“SCTV”) in 1976 alongside fellow Canadian comedians and future stars Eugene Levy, John Candy, Martin Short and Rick Moranis. 

She became a star of the sketch comedy show for her ability to play both comedic and dramatic characters, and the friendships she made with Levy, Candy and the rest of her co-stars would last for decades.

“A lot of people come up to me to talk about ‘SCTV' – it is really amazing how long that show has lived on,” she said in 2008. “There have always been amazingly funny people in Canada, and we were just one group.”

“‘SCTV' might have strengthened the idea that your work can go farther than the city or the country you live in, and made it seem more accessible,” she added at the time.

During a period when “SCTV” was in between network deals in 1981, O'Hara was hired to join the cast of “SNL.” 

However, she quit the Lorne Michaels-created sketch comedy after only a few days without ever appearing on air. O'Hara ultimately returned to “SCTV” when it was picked up by NBC and rebranded as “SCTV Network 90.”

O'Hara's work on “SCTV Network 90” earned the comedian her first-ever Emmy Award for outstanding writing in a variety or music program in 1982. 38 years later, she would go on to win her second and final competitive Emmy for her role as Moira Rose in “Schitt's Creek.”

Although O'Hara ultimately left “SCTV” ahead of its fifth season in 1982, she returned for occasional guest appearances until the show's cancellation in 1984.

O'Hara, meanwhile, also led an impressive and successful film career.

She made her feature debut in the 1980 film “Double Negative,” alongside “SCTV” co-stars Candy, Levy, and Joe Flaherty.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Editor-In-Chief


	It's been an eventful few weeks for HBO/HBO Max with a string of strong releases. Kicking off the current streak was an unlikely breakout, low-key Canadian acquisition Heated Rivalry. The hockey gay romance took America by storm, averaging 9 million U.S. viewers and counting to pace as the #1 acquired scripted series launch in HBO Max history.


	It was followed by the January 8 return of HBO Max's breakout medical drama The Pitt, which is averaging 9.5 million U.S. viewers thus far, up 65% from Season 1 and ranking among the top 5 returning seasons in platform history — both in the U.S. and globally — only behind the second seasons of The Last of Us, House of the Dragon and Euphoria domestically and the three, plus Season 3 of The White Lotus globally. The medical drama, from ER‘s R. Scott Gemmill, John Wells and Noah Wyle, also recently picked up more trophies at the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Awards, including Best Drama Series at both.

	











	Another January launch, HBO's new Game of Thrones prequel series A Knight of The Seven Kingdoms, created by Ira Parker and George R.R. Martin, is averaging over 8 million U.S. cross-platform viewers thus far, pacing as a top 3 series debut globally in platform history behind House of the Dragon (17.2M over the same period) and The Last Of Us. Its companion, Season 4 of Mickey Down and Konrad Kay's Industry is nearing a more modest 1.5 million U.S. cross-platform viewers but it is up year-to-year, with Season 4 outpacing Season 3 by about +40% and lifting global streaming of Season 1 nearly +50% last week to their highest levels ever as audiences continue to discover the series.

	What's more, all four series are delivering those viewership levels at very reasonable price tags, a fraction of the $20 million an episode House of the Dragon and other big-scale, high-end dramas reportedly cost.


	In an interview with Deadline, Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO of HBO and HBO Max Content, addressed the quartet's performance and the status of additional seasons already ordered for The Pitt, AKOTSK and Heated Rivalry while hinting that a Season 5 of Industry may not be far behind. 


AKOTSK, which is based on Game of Thrones author Martin's three Dunk and Egg novellas (one season per book), is the second GoT prequel to get a series order after House of the Dragon. In the meanwhile, HBO has developed a slew of other offshoots, with a number being rumored to be currently in the works, including a Jon Snow and Arya Stark sequel written by Quoc Dang Tran; an animated Sea Snake project Nine Voyages, with Genndy Tartakovsky said to be attached, as well as 10,000 Ships written by Eboni Booth and Aegon's Conquest penned by Mattson Tomlin.


	Bloys would not comment on any of the alleged GoT development projects but indicated that the success of the smaller-scale, modestly budgeted A Knight of the Seven Kingdom is informing their development strategy. 


RELATED: Everything We Know About ‘The White Lotus' Season 4 So Far


	He reflected on HBO's association with Martin, who, in a recent Hollywood Reporter profile confirmed creative friction on House of the Dragon that started during Season 2 and came to a head at a start of Season 3 when the author allegedly temporarily stepped back. Not mincing words, Martin called his relationship with showrunner Ryan Condal, his co-creator on the series, “abysmal.” 


	Bloys also addressed Condal's comments that Season 4 of HoD, whose third season premieres this summer, will be its last as well as wide speculation that the upcoming final seasons of HBO's The Last of Us and HBO Max's Hacks will also be their last. 


	As for Euphoria, whose third season was a logistical miracle, reassembling a cast of high-priced movie superstars, there may be some hope for more.


	Bloys also discussed the swift acquisition of Crave's drama Heated Rivalry, created by Jacob Tierney, whose success turned its young stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie into global celebrities overnight and whether HBO would get involved in the show creatively going forward.

	And yes, Deadline asked Bloys about the proposed Netflix acquisition of Warner Bros. that would bring HBO into the fold of its main rival. 


DEADLINE: Is the success of The Pitt a lesson that you don't have to spend $20 million an episode to get a big commercially successful and acclaimed show?


BLOYS: I don't know if it's a lesson so much as it's the history of television, there is a reason why shows were designed this way. What we were hoping for — and what The Pitt delivered — was more than six or eight weeks of episodes, 15 weeks of weekly engagement, but also, and probably most importantly in this environment, setting up a show that is creatively capable of coming back within a year, and with producers who are able to do that. 


	That obviously used to be the norm, and as an industry, we've gotten away from it as shows have gotten bigger and more complicated: special effects, shooting overseas, and all of the things that make shows bigger and more cinematic, but also more challenging to produce. The idea of getting back to the basics, back to what television was, the people who know how to do that, it's a skill, and John and Scott and Noah know how to do that; John has made some of the best shows with the highest episode counts there are. So if you want to achieve those things, you have to go to people who understand how to set it up and execute on that.

	











DEADLINE: The Pitt has been able to replicate the creative strength of its first season in Season 2. How do you feel about them keeping up the level for the recently ordered Season 3? 


BLOYS: I have zero doubts about their ability to keep it going.


DEADLINE: Are you excited about the pitch for Season 3?


BLOYS: They're only preliminarily talking about ideas. This is a bet on that creative team, and what they've proven with Season 1 and Season 2. I don't need to hear the specifics of what happens to understand what they're going to do.


DEADLINE: Will they keep the cadence? Can we mark our calendars for a January 2027 Season 3 debut?


BLOYS (laughs): I don't know the exact date but yes, the idea is to keep it on on an annual basis. One of the big goals in putting a show like this on the air was to be able to bring it back annually, that is an important part of the equation.


DEADLINE: Like The Pitt, A Knight of Seven Kingdoms also is delivering strong viewership on a modest budget and a smaller scale than House of Dragon, for example. Are you starting to rethink the model to possibly do more of these type of shows? 


BLOYS: No, no, no. Firstly, and most importantly, the creative has to lead it and to use the two examples that you brought up, The Pitt and Seven Kingdoms. One of the reasons why medical shows have been a staple of television is it is a unique setup where you spend the majority of your time in one location, and drama walks through your door, three times an episode, somebody dying, somebody in distress.


	That's a unique setup that allows you to sustain the storytelling for 15 episodes. The production model is important, and I would say it serves the creative. The same thing with the Knight of Seven Kingdoms. If you think about the novellas, it's a two-hander. It's two unlikely friends and heroes wandering Westeros. From its inception, from the starting point, it is not warring families, it is not dragons, it is not giant battles. So the creative made sense first, and then the production follows.


	I'm not looking to change the way that we make television at all. Our business has always been a portfolio business, which means you can have shows like The Last of Us or House Of the Dragon, and you can also have smaller-scale shows like Somebody Somewhere or The Chair Company, adding things that can come back on an annual basis, like The Pitt, or adding things where the creative lends itself, in Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, I don't want to say an easier production, but something that allows you, on a smaller scale, to produce and come back on an annual basis.


DEADLINE: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms has been renewed for a second season. There are three novellas but George R.R. Martin has indicated that he has put other ideas to paper. Is there a possibility for the show to go beyond three seasons?


BLOYS: That would be a conversation with Ira and George. Certainly possible. So we'll see. They're producing Season 2 right now, Season 3 beyond that. I haven't really gotten into what's possible beyond that, but if he's got more stories, it's certainly something to talk to Ira and George about.


DEADLINE: Has production on Season 2 started? 


BLOYS: Yes, they're currently shooting. This will be annual. Again, it was something that we were trying to — it's not possible for all shows — but it is something that, where it's possible creatively, to get back to that and we'd like to try and do that.

	











DEADLINE: How would you describe HBO's relationship with George R.R. Martin? He recently called his relationship with Ryan Condal “abysmal.” 


BLOYS: Like any good American family, I would prefer that our dysfunction stays behind closed doors. But here we are. What I would say is George introduced us to Ryan as the person that he thought would be the best to create House the Dragon. And I will say Ryan has been an excellent showrunner and a really great partner and collaborator, so we embrace his vision and his creative choices, or we wouldn't have done it.


DEADLINE: Do you still have an overall deal with George R.R. Martin?


BLOYS. Yes. Listen, I consider it great to have George as the architect of this world. I mean, think about what he has created, the world, the families, the battles, all of the history, it's pretty extraordinary. George is a great partner for us to have. The idea that he is going to agree with every creator or showrunner that is either developing or producing, two artists are not always going to agree. So, some of this comes with the territory.


DEADLINE:  How involved was he in Season 3? Did he really pull back and then come back?


BLOYS: He definitely took a step back. And I would say he's definitely been focusing on Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. And I will tell you one of the reasons why [head of drama] Frannie [Orsi] and I really thought about the Knight of Seven Kingdoms as an interesting adaptation is, we had always heard and know that it was George's favorite, that was meaningful to us.


DEADLINE: What is your assessment of House of the Dragon Season 3 creatively compared to previous seasons? 


BLOYS: I'm thrilled. BTW, I've been thrilled by all three seasons. If you remind yourself of the Rotten Tomato stores of the first two seasons, it's 87%; this has been a very successful show for us. So, again, I will say I'm thrilled with what Ryan has done, he's been a great collaborator with us.


DEADLINE: HoD has been renewed for a Season 4, and Ryan has gone on the record that it will be the final season. I don't think HBO has said it officially. Is this the case?


BLOYS: Yes, that is the idea. The idea has always been to follow the history of the Targaryens. If you know the books, you know how the Targaryens end up. So there is a natural end to this particular history of that House of the Targaryens.


DEADLINE: And any plans to have a supersized final season?


BLOYS: Ryan is working, like any show like this; he is finishing post on Season 3 and working with the writers on what Season 4 looks like. I don't know where he's landed on the episode count yet.


DEADLINE: Since we're talking about endings, I'm going to ask about Hacks and The Last of Us‘ upcoming seasons also being final. Is it something you can confirm?


BLOYS: It certainly seems that way, but on decisions like that, we will defer to the showrunners. So you can ask them.


DEADLINE: I deliberately did not include Euphoria in the last question. It has been widely expected that Season 3 would be the final chapter but I hear that creator Sam Levinson may have an idea for a potential fourth season. What's happening with that?


BLOYS: What's happening is Sam is finishing the third season, which I will say he's come up with an incredible way to move all these characters ahead five years, it's really exciting to see. We're just starting to see the cuts, which are great. But in terms of what he wants to do next, we will have a conversation about what he's thinking. But right now, he's focused on finishing three and getting it out.

	











DEADLINE: Do you think it's feasible that you can bring the cast back? 


BLOYS: Not something I can even get into. We need to find out what Sam is thinking, what he wants to do creatively either with the show, with his life. I don't know exactly what he wants to do next, so that'll be a conversation with him. But he is in the thick of Season 3 right now.


DEADLINE: And a show that has found itself surprisingly in limbo with no renewal yet, IT: Welcome to Derry. What is the rationale; it did so well? 


BLOYS: Let me say, not in limbo at all. Hardly. It was a huge success for us. And Andy [Muschietti] and Barbara [Muschietti] are hard at work trying to come up with an idea for a story they'd want to tell for another season. I would happily do it. One of the challenges is, there's not a book that you're basing it on, so it's invention. They want to make sure that they have a story they're excited to tell. So it's not limbo other than they need to land on something they're excited by creatively. We'll be there.


DEADLINE: It's probably going to be the same answer on The Rehearsal. You said in September that it's all in Nathan Fielder's hands. Has he come up with an idea for Season 3 yet? 


BLOYS: Yes. He's talking to [HBO head of comedy] Amy Gravitt about ideas. I think he has a kernel of an idea that he seems to be excited by, but he and Amy are talking. So again, when he's ready, he will come to us.


DEADLINE: What is your assessment of It's Florida, Man? It is an experiment; a different kind of budget, a different setup. 


BLOYS: It's Danny McBride and his company, and I think it's a lot of fun. I'll break news with you, we are going to do another season. 


DEADLINE: The rumored slate of Game of Thrones offshoots. Is there anything real? The Jon Snow-Arya Stark sequel, where is that at?


BLOYS: Well, since you're asking, you know what my answer is going to be, is that we don't really talk about development. But, one thing I will say that's interesting. Obviously, there's a lot of interest around the Game of Thrones universe. And one thing I noticed with the launch of The Seven Kingdoms was this idea that it was the latest Game of Thrones spinoff. 


	And I do like to remind people that there have been exactly two spinoffs, House of the Dragon, and then The Seven Kingdoms which launched two weeks ago. Sometimes, because of the intense interest in development, I think people get confused and believe that development means something is actually in production. So I just want to be clear about that we've been very, very judicious about shows that we produce. We'll develop a lot because we want to give ourselves the best chance of finding a show that makes sense, but we have not produced all that much. This is not Marvel level, four series a year, or anything like that. So sometimes people confuse development speculation with actual shows being produced.


DEADLINE: Can you at least give us a sense how many of the HoD live-action and animated spinoffs that have been in development are still active and whether any of them is close to a green light?


BLOYS: I'm not getting into any of that. Development is development, we like to give ourselves as many options as possible. And that's part of the reason why it makes no sense for us to comment on it, because it does fuel this idea that misinformation, and shows are about to be greenlit, and so we just try to keep a lid on it. I know it all comes from the place of being excited, but we try to be careful about what we actually develop and produce.

	











DEADLINE: In terms of scope, is the slate of offshoots more diversified given the success of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms? Are you looking for stories in the GoT world that can be told that way?


BLOYS: I do think that A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms was instructive in that it does show that the interest in the Game of Thrones universe is there, whether it is huge set pieces or more intimate character piece. So that was instructive. But the way we develop is from the stories. And like I said, from the beginning, George's conception of the Dunk and Egg novellas was on a small scale. So I don't think I would take what would otherwise be a giant show and try to produce it smaller. The creative has to lead.


DEADLINE: George has been listed as co-creator on the two GoT spinoffs to date. Will that continue to be the case going forward?


BLOYS: I suspect, because he's been fairly involved in the process.


DEADLINE: The success of Heated Rivalry, did it catch you by surprise?


DEADLINE: We've got it in Australia, US, Italy, Germany, I think also in Latin America and some other territories, but we picked it up in the US, I wanna say, three weeks before it aired. I think what was happening was, Crave originally was going to take it out in 2027 and then they liked what they were seeing and moved up the airdate. So the sales process was more accelerated. 


	When I was sent the episodes, I was surprised it was available. It's rare that you'll see a finished show available three weeks from air. So it was a strange situation that was even available, but I was happy it was available. It was a very easy yes, like, of course, we'll take it. I was able to see all the episodes, and I would say that we had some sense that it would make waves or be something that people talked about, but not the way that [it did], the stardom that these guys have experienced and the conversation around the show has been a really nice story and a fun story to witness and be a part of. 


DEADLINE: Was it competitive, did you have to bid against other streamers in the US? 


BLOYS: Well, we moved very quickly. I got it on a Friday. We made an offer on a Monday. I'm not exactly sure where else Crave was selling this, so I don't know the details of the sales process, but I was just happy that we got in there and got it done. 


DEADLINE: Is this the best return on investment ever in the history of HBO? 


BLOYS (laughs): It's gotta be pretty close. It was a great move, and we're thrilled to have it on HBO Max. And look forward to Seasons 2 and 3. 


DEADLINE: Do you have to pay more for licensing future seasons in light of the success?


BLOYS: Typically, when you make a deal like this, any subsequent seasons are included. So thanks to Crave for producing the show


DEADLINE: And they have to deal with renegotiations with the actors, right?


BLOYS: It is a Crave original, so I imagine. We're very happy licensees.


DEADLINE: So you have no desire to come in as a co-producer? 


BLOYS. No, there is no reason. This is obviously a very successful creative collaboration between Jacob and Crave. I see no reason why we would be involved creatively. And as I said, I'm thrilled to have it on our platform, and I'm very happy to be the licensee in a lot of big markets around the world. So I'm very happy, and I'm excited to see whatever they come up with for Seasons 2 and 3. 

	











DEADLINE: So the show will not be HBO-ized? 


BLOYS: No, no, no. 


DEADLINE: What can you say about Season 2? Production was supposed to start, I think June or July, but people may try to put a rush on it now, given the success.


BLOYS: I don't know. That really is between Jacob and Crave and actors. I've seen in the press, I think the actors have speculated, maybe summer sometime. I don't really know.


DEADLINE: What's next? Would you do more acquisitions for HBO Max or was this a lightning in a bottle?


BLOYS: It is lightning in a bottle, for sure. But, obviously, we have big acquisitions. We have a huge Warner Brothers library, we have Mad Men, for example, on the platform, we do acquisitions. It is rare for an acquired original to blow up like this.


DEADLINE: Compared to the numbers we just mentioned, Industry‘s 1.5 million viewers delivery is modest, but it's 40% up from Season 3. Talk about how HBO can afford to renew shows that it believes in that may not be broad hits.


BLOYS: Industry is a really great story. First of all, it has grown. It's unusual in that it has grown every season. And typically, we see growth within the season, and then when we bring back Season 2, Season 3, and Season 4, we've seen catch-up viewing on each previous season. So it's been a nice effect.


	I have to give credit to Jane Tranter, who we developed the show with, she's a producer at Bad Wolf. We started out saying, let's try and produce a very modestly budgeted show. Bad Wolf has studios in Cardiff, Wales, and the idea was to find talent coming out of drama school, something we could shoot mostly in Cardiff. So it was very modestly budgeted, and continues to be, relative to other shows, very modestly budgeted and easy to say yes to, and that was all due to Bad Wolf and to Jane.


	And I'll say, what's nice about the show is everybody involved, Mickey and Konrad, the actors, everybody's profile has grown exactly as you want to see with a show like this. It does prove again that TV makes stars. Seeing Myha'la and Marisa [Abela] and their profiles rise and Mickey and Konrad, how they're running the show has been really exciting to see. So it's really been a great success story for us, for our collaboration with Bad Wolf.


DEADLINE: You started adding big names with Kit Harington in Season 3, and even more this season, so it is not the same small show anymore.


BLOYS: But I will say it is still a very smartly produced show. In other words, the budget isn't some massive thing. It is a smartly produced.


DEADLINE: Since Industry seems to be breaking out, can we expect another renewal? 


BLOYS: You'll have to wait and see.


DEADLINE: With all the activity at HBO, we need to acknowledge what is happening in the background. I know you can't say much but how would you imagine HBO adding prestige to Netflix's slate? 


BLOYS: Well, as you imagine, not a lot I can talk about. Obviously, I read what you write and what other people put out there, so I don't have any inside knowledge about anything, and it's not far enough along that we've had any discussions about what it would look like or anything like that. So it's not something I can comment on because I don't know a lot about it.


DEADLINE: Okay, but does it excite you, the idea that you may team up with your biggest rival whom you're fighting at every awards show?


BLOYS: Could be fun. 

	











DEADLINE: And last but not least, have you narrowed down the premiere window for the Harry Potter series?


BLOYS: Well, we've been saying 2027. I would say, to narrow it down to some extent, early 2027. And now you're going to ask, does that mean January, February, March, April, that we're not ready to say. I'll say early 2027.

Editor-In-Chief


IT: Welcome to Derry has been a ratings standout for HBO, hitting multiple series highs, culminating with 6.5M U.S. viewers across HBO and HBO Max for the finale within the first three days of availability. At the time of the Dec. 14 finale release, the freshman season had been averaging nearly 20M viewers globally to rank among the Top 3 original series debuts on HBO Max launched, behind only The Last of Us and House of the Dragon.


	And yet, more than a month later, the Stephen King adaptation executive produced by Andy Muschietti and Barbara Muschietti is yet to be renewed for a second season. As part of a wide-ranging interview, Deadline asked Casey Bloys why Welcome to Derry has found itself surprisingly in limbo with no renewal after it did so well.

	











	“Let me say, not in limbo at all. Hardly. It was a huge success for us,” he said. “Andy and Barbara are hard at work trying to come up with an idea for a story they'd want to tell for another season. I would happily do it. One of the challenges is, there's not a book that you're basing it on, so it's invention. They want to make sure that they have a story they're excited to tell. So it's not limbo other than they need to land on something they're excited by creatively. We'll be there.”

	Andy Muschietti told Deadline in December that he is hoping to do a three-season arc. He revealed that he intends for Season 2 to go backward in time to 1935, 27 years before the first season to bring audiences along for yet another of IT's murderous cycle. The finale also gives a big hint as to why this story is being told backward.

	











	The series is executive produced by Andy Muschietti and Barbara Muschietti through their Double Dream production company alongside Jason Fuchs and Brad Caleb Kane, who also serve as co-showrunners.

HBO stop dragging your feet and renew it. Stop being dumb

EXCLUSIVE: Don Lemon will appear before a federal judge this afternoon in downtown LA after being arrested by federal agents late Thursday night. While the charges against the former CNN anchor remain sealed by the Department of Justice and have yet to appear in a court docket, Lemon is being held in federal custody.


	Earlier Friday, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said that Lemon was facing “conspiracy to Deprive Rights, and …interfering by force of someone's First Amendment rights.” If found guilty, Lemon could face up to a decade behind bars on the first charge and fines and more than a year in prison on the second charge if prosecuted as a misdemeanor violation.

	Expected to show up in court at around 1 pm PT, Lemon was taken into custody by federal agents in Los Angeles County just before midnight on January 29 in Beverly Hills. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The arrest was in connection with an anti-ICE protest at a Minneapolis church earlier this month that Lemon covered, his lawyer Abbe Lowell said this morning. Acclaimed journalist and producer Georgia Fort live streamed her arrest in Minnesota today in conjunction to the church coverage. Always declaring he was a journalist covering the church event in the northern state, the former CNN anchor was in L.A. to cover this weekend's Grammy Awards when he was arrested.


	When asked about Lemon at a press conference Friday on more Jeffrey Epstein material being released, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche replied in typical Trump administration fashion: ‘Do you want me to jump up and down?” While Attorney General Pam Bondi alleged there was some sort of coordinated effort on the part of activists and journalists like Lemon to disrupt the church gathering, no information on the decision to snag Lemon last night has been provided — even though previous recent cases against Lemon have been tossed out by the courts.

	











	Also in typical Trump distraction mode as a backlash to the Lemon arrest grew today, the long delaying DOJ dumped boatloads of redacted documents related to the case of one-time Trump party pal and convicted sex offender Epstein. Flooding the zone after more than a month of violating the law over the release of the so-called Epstein Files, the DOJ also suddenly put out more than 2,000 videos and nearly 200,000 images connected to the deceased and well-connected financier. Blanche called the DOJ's Epstein Files work “completed,” though much still seems not to be in the public sphere.


	Detailing how much of the UTA-repped Lemon's situation is in the legal shadows, LA Mayor Karen Bass said this morning that she had “reached out to the U.S. Attorney to check on Don Lemon's status.” The Los Angeles Police Department and Sheriff's Department had no knowledge of where Lemon was being held when contacted by Deadline. We have reached out to the FBI's Los Angeles office and will update this story if/when they respond.


	Sources close to the journalist tell us that Lemon is in a federal facility in DTLA. The nature of the hearing that Lemon is expected to attend later today will likely be a straightforward arraignment. 


	A Trump foe herself, Bass added in her statement on Lemon : “The arrest of journalists for going into a church in the course of reporting is shocking enough, but what's even more alarming is that it's no secret that Don Lemon is a Trump critic. Let me be very clear – President Trump is not deescalating anything after the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens by federal agents. In fact, the arrest of Don Lemon and Georgia Fort demonstrates quite the opposite – he is escalating.” 


	Coming on the planned National Shutdown day of protests over the killing of American citizens by ICE agents in Minneapolis and other violence, abductions, and deportations by the feds, Lemon's arrest is the latest antagonism between the journalist and the MAGA crowd.  


	After announcements of Lemon's arrest by Pam Bondi and others, the White House unsurprisingly took to social media to mock him and this latest outcome — with emojis of chains thrown in too. Bernice King, CEO of Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, had a quick and blunt response, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's daughter called the administration's post full of “Immaturity, poor taste, and fascism.”

	This isn't the first time this month that the Trump administration has gone after Lemon personally. 


	DOJ had tried to arrest the 59-year-old Lemon and the other journalists before but a federal magistrate judge earlier this week turned down arrest warrants for five people connected to the protest. At the time, Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko said prosecutors had failed to present evidence to justify their arrests.


	But in a case of try, try and try again typical to the Trump administration's attitude to its critics, a trip to a grand jury and last night's arrest of Lemon makes it very clear the journalist was still considered a thorn in their thin skinned paw.


	Lemon has said he was working as a journalist when he had followed protesters into the Twin Cities church on January 18 to observe the demonstration against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the city. Inside the church, Lemon captured video and interviewed ICE protesters. Covering ICE crackdowns and similar federal moves over the past, Lemon has said that he “had no affiliation” to the protest organization. “I didn't even know they were going to this church until we followed them. We were there chronicling protests,” he said.

	











	“Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different from what he has always done,” his lawyer Lowell said Friday after her client's arrest. 


	“The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable,” Lowell added. “There is no more important time for people like Don to be doing his work.”


	Attorney General Bondi has been touting the DOJ's arrest of a number of demonstrators, and posted on X Friday, “At my direction, early this morning federal agents arrested Don Lemon, Trahern Jeen Crews, Georgia Fort, and Jamael Lydell Lundy, in connection with the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota. More details soon.”

Best. News. Ever.

Attack? They really do think everybody is just stupid don't they?

…Make Lemon aid.

ICE goes into churches and interrupts services to do their whole SS act, why aren't they being arrested?

Please add reference to a qualified news article where they interrupted an ongoing service. Thanks, helps to shut down disagreeing arguments.

	After telling Rolling Stone last year that Queen were in discussions about performing at the Sphere in Las Vegas, guitarist Brian May has now ruled out any American concerts for the foreseeable future.  “America is a dangerous place at the moment, so you have to take that into account,” May told the Daily Mail, in the wake of the deaths of two U.S. citizens at the hands of immigration officials in Minnesota. “It's very sad because I feel like Queen grew up in America and we love it, but it's not what it was. Everyone is thinking twice about going there at the moment.”


	Last year, during a Rolling Stone interview for the 50th anniversary of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” May had been effusive about the prospects of a Vegas residency. “I'm very keen on the Sphere,” he said at the time. “It's got my mind working. I sat there watching the Eagles, thinking, ‘We should do this. The stuff that we could bring to this would be stupendous.' So, yeah, I would like to do it. We're having conversations.”

	











	Queen + Adam Lambert last performed in the U.S. in November 2023, on a global tour that concluded at Tokyo Dome in February 2024. May suffered a minor stroke in 2024, but he's returned to the stage, including a Coachella performance with Benson Boone last year.

	Previously, Queen repeatedly demanded that President Donald stop using “We Will Rock You” and “We Are the Champions” at campaign events — efforts a band spokesperson described in 2020 as an “uphill battle.”

	May also told the Daily Mail that the band would never headline Glastonbury Festival, citing his opposition to the treatment of animals on the festival's Worthy Farm grounds. “I wouldn't do Glastonbury next year because of the politics of the people who run it,” he said, “Unless that changes, I won't do it.”

	











	Queen may still return to the stage, however. “Never say never about not coming back,” May said. “There are a couple of things you haven't heard… I don't know when Queen will be back on stage — it's an unknown. We'll take it day by day.”

The first look at the fab four in Sam Mendes' Beatles biopics has arrived—in the mail. Yesterday (January 29), the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, which was co-founded by Paul McCartney, sent out postcards with photos of Paul Mescal, Barry Keoghan, Harris Dickinson, and Joseph Quinn as their respective characters. Mescal plays McCartney, Keoghan plays Ringo Starr, Dickinson plays John Lennon, and Quinn plays George Harrison. See the cast below.

All four of Mendes' films—the first scripted movies to be granted the Beatles' life and music rights—are currently set to be released on April 7, 2028, according to Variety. The Beatles – A Four-Film Cinematic Event also stars Saoirse Ronan as Linda McCartney, Mia McKenna-Bruce as Maureen Starkey Tigrett, Anna Sawai as Yoko Ono, Aimee Lou Wood as Pattie Boyd, James Norton as Brian Epstein, and Harry Lloyd as George Martin.

EXCLUSIVE: As Italy readies itself for the Winter Olympics, a question hangs in the cold air of Milano-Cortina: Could Netflix snatch European TV rights to the world's grandest sporting spectacle when it acquires Warner Bros. Discovery?


	The winter Games will screen on Warner Bros. Discovery across 49 European territories next month, but as the Hollywood studio's future is settled, Deadline can reveal that live conversations are taking place about the television rights to future Olympics, not least Los Angeles 2028.


	Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) describes itself as the “home of the Olympics in Europe” after renewing its partnership with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2023. The deal gave WBD access to every moment of every Games until 2032 as part of a shared arrangement with members of the European Broadcasting Union, such as the BBC, which have guaranteed output regardless of who else holds rights.

	WBD is going through the process of splitting itself into two units: Discovery Global, a publicly-traded company that will launch in July and comprise CNN and free-to-air channels across Europe; and a studios business, which Netflix is planning to acquire for $83BN, giving it control over Harry Potter and Superman.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Given that WBD CEO David Zaslav first struck a deal for the Olympics in 2015, when he was leading a pre-Warner Discovery Communications, Netflix and others had expected that Discovery Global would house the current Olympics deal. Deadline hears, however, that Zaslav has yet to decide on where the Games will land. 

	











	This leaves open the possibility that he keeps the Olympics at Warner's studios operations (where he will remain as CEO post-separation), meaning that the rights would ultimately fall under Netflix when the flame arrives at the LA Memorial Coliseum. It's not yet known if Zaslav will have a role at a Netflix-controlled Warner, as we reported last month.


	Sources said that a WBD decision is not expected until after Milano-Cortina 2026, but those familiar with the matter acknowledged that the Games would be attractive for Zaslav, a renowned sports fan and Olympics lover. A WBD spokesperson declined to comment.


	There are also those at Netflix who believe the Olympics rights would be a spectacular addition to the streamer as it grows live events coverage, which includes WWE, audacious skyscraper climbs, and U.S. rights to the FIFA Women's World Cup from 2027. That said, even if Netflix does become parent to Olympics rights, it could still choose to house them on a Warner Bros. platform like HBO Max. 


	Netflix declined to comment. The IOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


TNT Sports Adds To Complexity In UK


	The situation is even more complicated in the UK, where Netflix will hold a stake in TNT Sports' British operations as part of its takeover of Warner Bros.' studio business. WBD runs TNT Sports as a joint venture with telecoms company BT, and the network will be the home to the Winter Olympics from next week. The BBC will also have rights to 450 hours of live action from the Games.


	The TNT Sports arrangement seemingly increases the chances of Netflix getting Olympics rights in the UK, but again, nothing is certain. If WBD does decide to keep the rights at Discovery Global, executives at the new company could — in theory — take the Games off TNT Sports and hand them to another service, such as the Discovery+ streamer.


	In an environment in which consolidation will likely require sign-off from Donald Trump's administration, and with Paramount continuing its hostile hovering, sports rights are not exactly at the top of the agenda. But the Olympics are a prized asset, and uncertainty over the rights situation in Europe shows there is plenty to play for.

The first-look photos from Sam Mendes' films were released around the band's hometown of Liverpool earlier this week — here they are in hi-res.


							By

	The first high-res images of Paul Mescal, Harris Dickinson, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan in character as the Beatles have arrived.


	The photos of the Hollywood stars were first printed out by Sony on four different postcards and dispersed throughout Liverpool's Institute of Performing Arts, as well as in Hamburg, New York City and Tokyo, on Thursday.




	On Friday, the images in all their glory were released to the press (see below), showing Mescal as Paul McCartney, Dickinson as John Lennon, Quinn as George Harrison and Keoghan as Ringo Starr on set. Also starring in the films is Saoirse Ronan as Linda McCartney, James Norton as Brian Epstein, Anna Sawai as Yoko Ono, Aimee Lou Wood as Pattie Boyd, Harry Lloyd as George Martin and Mia McKenna-Bruce as Maureen Starkey.

	Sam Mendes‘ The Beatles – A Four-Film Cinematic Event is currently set to premiere in theaters April 2028, with each movie following a different member of the biggest-selling music act of all time. Production is underway on the films, which makes sense given the mop top haircut Keoghan was sporting at the Crime 101 premiere in London earlier this week.


	The Liverpudlian band first skyrocketed to fame in 1963 and would break hundreds of industry records before their official breakup in 1970. McCartney and Starr remain the only surviving members after Lennon's 1980 assassination and Harrison's 2001 death from lung cancer.

	











	The movies officially announced the four leads at last year's CinemaCon, where Mendes took the stage with the stars. “We're not just making one film about the Beatles — we're making four,” he had told the crowd: “Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply.”


	Mendes produces alongside Neal Street Productions' Pippa Harris and Julie Pastor. Writing the screenplays are Ford v Ferrari‘s Jez Butterworth, Conclave‘s Peter Straughan and Adolescence‘s Jack Thorne — a trio which should, given their recent award wins, fill the average Beatles fan with hope.


	Tom Rothman told The Hollywood Reporter about getting signoff from the band's label Apple Corps: “You have to match the boldness of the idea with a bold release strategy. There hasn't been an enterprise like this before, and you can't think about it in traditional releasing terms.”

	When Matthew Allen woke up on Saturday, Jan. 24, he was looking forward to running errands. Allen, better known in the Twin Cities as the musician and rapper Nur-D, had spent the previous day with thousands of Minnesotans marching on the streets in -15º weather to protest the ongoing violent federal occupation of the state. Now the weekend had arrived, and Allen woke up excited to spend his day shopping for window blinds and dog food with his wife. “I was planning on having a regular day,” he says.


	But soon after getting up, Allen did what millions of Americans did that Saturday morning: He picked up his phone and found himself staring at footage of federal immigration officers shooting and killing VA nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Allen and his wife changed up their plans, thinking they'd stop by a protest for a little bit before going on with their day.


	What happened, instead, is that Allen was chased, tackled, sprayed with an acrid substance, and violently detained by federal immigration officers, who, he claims, told him he was being arrested for assaulting a federal officer, a charge he says was baseless. 

	











	“My name is Matthew James Obadiah Allen,” he screamed while being pinned to the ground, “I have done nothing at all….I'm a United States citizen.”  


	Given what had happened earlier that day to Pretti, Allen says he believed, in that moment, that those would be his final words. 


	“I assumed I was going to die,” Allen tells Rolling Stone, “so I was going to make it as clear and concise as I possibly could.”


	“You wanna kill me on the street?” he shouted as the masked men stood over him. “You're gonna have to fucking kill me. I have done nothing wrong.”


	Five days later, Allen thinks back to what was going through his head at that moment. “I'm not going to let you slave-catch me,” he says. “I'm not going to help you, in any way, make this into something it's not. This is grabbing someone in the street who has done nothing wrong and killing them, and if that's what we're doing — I've already seen you do it today — that's why any of us are even here right now. Most of us would rather be doing what we love to do on a Saturday morning.”

	As Nur-D, Allen has made a name for himself in the Twin Cities scene, performing at the local Soundset hip-hop festival and collaborating with the Minnesota Orchestra in recent years. Much of his music, especially on his latest album, Chunkadelic, is about the joy he feels being from his hometown: “Turn to my neighbors, say where you from?” the Rosemount, Minnesota, native sings on “Franklin Ave,” before launching into the prideful chorus: “This my city, this my vibe, this my town.” 


	He is also a veteran of local community organizing and protest; the last time he spoke to Rolling Stone was May 2020, in the midst of the uprisings for George Floyd. “So much of what 2020 was, was ‘If this becomes something that is OK for the state to do, they will do it,'” Allen says today. “And the first people who are hit are the Black and brown people of our country.”


	Speaking with Rolling Stone, Allen is ambivalent about the attention he's received for his story of being violently detained last weekend. He understands that what happened to him pales in comparison to the violent disappearings and deaths of both American citizens and foreign-born people at the hands of the federal government across the country. Allen is not the first musician detained by immigration officials: Marcos Flores, the bassist in Denver-based band Summer of Peril, has been in a Colorado ICE detention facility for more than a month.

	“What happened to me probably won't even be a footnote in what's going on in our state and across the country,” says Allen. “But there are so many people who have been in the exact situation I was in, and they are just gone. So because I get to talk right now, I'm going to talk.”


	After being arrested, Allen was placed in the back of a white pick-up truck (“worst-case scenario” as a Black man, he says) and then driven some distance to an unknown outdoor location in Minneapolis. At that point, Allen says, he was thrown out of the car, at which point he ignored a command to take his clothes off. “I refused to move my body,” he says. Instead, he kept repeating his full name, reiterating that he was a citizen, and asked to speak to a lawyer.


	“I had asked, specifically, ‘If I comply with everything I am told to do, will I be shot?' And the answer was silence,” he says. “So I didn't move.”


	After some time — he doesn't know how long — Allen, who had been demanding medical attention after being sprayed with a chemical agent in the face, was placed in a stretcher, transferred to an ambulance, and brought to a hospital. It was not until he entered the emergency room at the Hennepin County Medical Center that he realized he might be safe. He is incredibly grateful for both the EMT professional named Andrew who calmed him down in the ambulance, as well as the nurses who provided care in the hospital. By evening, Allen was back at home with his wife. 

	











	Since then, Allen has been walking around with a knee brace and a limp. He's banged up, and he's had a hard time sleeping lately, knowing that ICE officials now have his name and could find him at any point. But above all, he feels lucky and fortunate. He's since retained a team of attorneys, including Rodney King's civil rights lawyer John Burris, to pursue legal action against the government for their violation of his civil liberties.  


	He's grateful for his Twin Cities neighbors and doesn't regret, for a second, having shown up to protest in the wake of Pretti's death that Saturday morning. “The thing that pays my bills is that my community pays to see me do what I love the most,” he says. “How could I not be out here? It's them — they're the ones who spend five, seven, 10 dollars on my art. So if that's something they're gonna do, I will step up for them.”


	What he wants those outside Minnesota to understand about the ongoing federal occupation (the government is referring to it as Operation Metro Surge, with a stated purpose of apprehending violent immigrants), is that the conflict between federal agents and the people of Minnesota has not been a fight between two equal sides. 


	“This is not the people you disagree with versus the people you agree with,” he says. “This is a heavily armed people willing to murder versus snowballs and signs….We're human beings saying ‘Stop killing us.' It's crazy that that's a political statement, and I would very much like it if people would stop making it one.”

	Speaking to Rolling Stone the day before a planned nationwide strike modeled after Minnesota's recent statewide strike (and endorsed by everyone from Ariana Grande to Pedro Pascal), Allen can't help but feel as though his home state has become a microcosm for the nation. 


	“Minnesota is like a mini-America,” he says. “We have a massively diverse group of people. We have a history both beautiful and horrific. And just like there are people in this country who say ‘We don't want people different than us on our streets,' there are thousands and thousands more who still stand in the street and say, ‘Those people are dumb.' We love the differences that we all bring. We love our brothers and sisters and nonbinary people and two-spirit people, all the human beings that live amongst us. And we will not stop fighting.”

The NFL great misidentified the pop singer twice on air during the 2023-2024 season  


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	Tony Romo never made it to a Super Bowl during his 14-year NFL career, but the former Dallas Cowboys star and CBS sports analyst still knows how to throw darts that stick a decade after leaving the game. Take, for instance, his repeated slip-ups during the 2023-2024 NFL season when he accidentally referred to Taylor Swift as Travis Kelce‘s “wife,” more than a year and a half before the couple got engaged.

	Now, in a new interview with SiriusXM's The Morning Mash Up on Thursday (Jan. 29), Romo, 45, said his mistake was actually no mistake at all.


	“I did, kind of, play with the fans a little bit I think I was like, ‘And there's…' I think I said, ‘his wife,'” Romo recalled of his cheeky quip. “I did that on purpose and people were like, ‘Do you know something?' I was like, ‘Nah, I just wanted to make you guys think for a second [and] just mess with you a little bit.'”


	After referring to Swift as Kelce's “wife” during the Dec. 10, 2023 Chiefs loss to the Buffalo Bills, a week later Romo let it slip again during the Chiefs' game against the Raiders, saying, “As you see, Kelce's wife, Taylor Swift, in the audience.” That time, he appeared to catch his slip-up, quickly adding the correction, “I'm sorry. Girlfriend!” Like the rest of the world, Romo's co-host, veteran broadcaster Jim Nantz, wanted to know if his boothmate had some secret information, asking if the former quarterback knew “something we don't know.”

	











	Now we know, he did not. 


	After Swift began dating Chiefs tight end Kelce in 2023, the world's biggest pop star — then in the midst of her record-setting Eras Tour — became a staple of network coverage of her boyfriend's team, with the camera often cutting to her several times a game to gauge her reaction to Kelce's play or check out which other celebs were joining her in the Kelce family skybox.


	Kelce and Swift made it official on Aug. 26, 2025 in a widely seen Instagram post in which Taylor wrote, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.” At press time the couple had not yet revealed a date or location for the wedding.

In the bonafide phenomenon that is “Heated Rivalry,” no interview with the stars or series creator Jacob Tierney can escape one question: why women would flock to a series about the turbulent romances of gay hockey players.

Truth is: For those of us who consume anime and manga, the breakout success of “Heated Rivalry” isn't a surprising cultural development at all. Long before the “Heated Rivalry” series premiered on HBO Max in November, the story existed as two novels from the popular “Game Changer” series by Canadian author Rachel Reid. It exists in the queer romance space overwhelmingly written and consumed by women — sometimes queer, often straight.

However, the book (and the show's) narrative stylization echo Japan's decades-old manga genre Boys' Love. Also known as BL, or Yaoi, it's written by women, for women. A niche category with an outsized cultural influence, it's known for its ability to explore and experience sexuality via narrative without a female presence.

We've seen this phenomenon in American media before, such as the U.S. adaptation of “Queer as Folk” (2000-2005), which intrigued a majority-female viewership with its chronicles of modern gay male life. Anne Rice's “The Vampire Chronicles” is another example of queer male narratives written by women; look at the online audience discussing its current AMC adaptation and the vast majority of its most avid fans are female.

Still, understand how Yaoi treats authorial perspective and queerness and you'll understand what feeds the fandom of “Heated Rivalry.”

 










Boys' Love dates back to 1970 with the publication of “Sunroom Nite.” It spread through self-published fan works (known as dōjinshi) and its popularity grew during the mid-'90s. Like many genres within the Japanese media umbrella, it refers to both its target audience and its subject matter. 

Traditionally, BL are romance and love stories between men that are written primarily by women and have a core audience of female readers. Japanese gay stories made by gay men for a gay male audience are typically referred to in Western circles as Bara. (There's also a lesbian genre known as Yuri, which has a more flexible relationship with demographics).

Questions of authorial identity, and whether it's appropriate for a queer story to be told by straight writers, are murky and controversial; it feeds much of the criticism surrounding epic best seller “A Little Life” by Hanya Yanagihara. 

BL, in its feminine perspective of homoerotic male relationships, offers a fascinating case study of this phenomenon. Many entries in the genre exist in the uncanny valley between heterosexuality and queerness, where a relationship is gay because of the physical absence of women more than the actual identities of the lovers.

A frequent trope in these romances is the men in love don't identify as gay; often these are the only men for whom they've ever had romantic feelings. Sex scenes in these manga are often mocked for their unrealistic positions and content; there's an entire Wikipedia page for the fan term “yaoi hole.” However, the defining cliché of Japanese BL is the Seme and the Uke, character archetypes that subtextually gender ostensibly same-sex relationships.

 










Seme is, bluntly, the top in the traditional BL relationship. A typical Seme is older, taller, and more muscular than his romantic interest, and is defined by dominance and sexual aggression (emphasis on aggression: notoriously, many BL love stories begin with rape or otherwise dubious consent that eventually morphs into true love). 

The Uke is the bottom, and is written in a way that codes him as female: he's shorter, thinner, pretty to the point that he may be androgynous, sexually inexperienced, shy, and emotional in a way that borders on histrionic.

Frequently, there's an unstated power imbalance that places the Seme in a position where he's “wooing” the Uke. It's an extreme heteronormative portrayal of gay relationships where the couple is essentially straight in all but aesthetics.

Reading BL as a gay man is generally not about seeing yourself reflected in the story. Unlike other queer male media, it's a female-centric fantasy that imagines a functionally heterosexual relationship between two men. 

So where's the appeal in that? Scant academic studies echo many of the interviews with Tierney and his cast: For female readers, there's a sense of safety in being removed from the sex and romance they consume; they also enjoy a relationship removed from the power dynamics of gender. Women have limited physical presence in BL media, but they're spiritually represented in the genre's tone, perspective, and who is meant to derive sexual pleasure from its contents.

 










For anyone who wondered why “Heated Rivalry” fans say they're “fujoing out” on Twitter, that's a takeoff of the BL term “fujoshi,” a pejorative roughly translating to “rotten girl” now reclaimed by female fans of queer male-centered works. South Korea, China, and Thailand also have developed their own live-action BL industries.

The “Heated Rivalry” universe has its roots in fanfiction, a genre that takes obvious inspiration from BL tropes. Reid's first novel “Game Changer,” which focuses on the characters Scott and Kip, notoriously began life as a fanfiction about Captain America and Bucky Barnes from the MCU and was later retrofitted into an original story.

“Heated Rivalry” is the second in the six-book series and was the most popular by far, even before the show's release. It does not have an explicit fanfiction counterpart, although the characters of Shane and Ilya take broad inspiration from the real-life rivalry between star hockey players Sid Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin. 

But, more than other books in Reid's series, “Heated Rivalry” and its love story slide neatly into many BL genre conventions.

Given the differences in Western and Eastern beauty standards, and the realities of setting a romance in the hockey world, neither Shane nor Ilya fit the mold of BL's feminine, willowy bishonen. All the same, both men fall neatly into stereotypical Seme and Uke roles that in some ways gender them despite their masculine appearances.

 










Notably, they're rigid about the sexual roles they take in their relationship. Reid's other books feature couples willing to switch it up (the most interesting part of the largely tedious “Game Changer” novel is smoothie-maker Kip's shock when the macho Scott asks to bottom the first time they hook up). Shane and Ilya, on the other hand, are strictly bottom and top. While this dynamic does reflect some queer relationships, it also carries connotations of one partner occupying a more “feminine” role — an idea the book's characterization reinforces.

Ilya fits the basic character traits of many Seme found in BL stories: Sexually experienced and confident, he pursues Shane while his bad-boy image hides a heart of gold. Shane is not particularly feminine in his presentation but his behavior and thoughts align with the Uke archetype: He's shy, has never been intimate with another man, is socially awkward and insecure, and is more emotionally open and sensitive than Ilya.

In the the book, Shane's thin characterization can make him come across as a self-insert for female audience members. A scene late in the novel reads extremely straight: As he watches Ilya play with children, Shane wonders if his lover will want kids.

Reid's writing leans into a stark physical dichotomy between the two men: “Rozanov was so… masculine. Shane was baby-faced and short, and couldn't grow proper facial hair, and barely had any chest hair. Rozanov was almost exactly the same age as him, but he looked like he had crossed over a magical line to adulthood.” She often highlights the physical differences between the two, with the height gap frequently referenced during sex scenes.

 










Uncomfortably, this is also how the novel explores Shane's racial identity. Neither the “Heated Rivalry” book nor its sequel, “The Long Game,” puts Shane's half-Japanese heritage in the context of his career in the NHL (a league that is roughly 90 percent white) or how it informs his experiences as a gay man. His ethnicity seems only to create an aesthetic difference that codes him as the more feminine of the two.

Much of this applies only to the “Heated Rivalry” book; even in “The Long Game” sequel, Reid softens Ilya considerably and complicates the couple's dynamics in ways that largely avoid Seme/Uke characteristics. The TV show hews faithfully to the original text in plot and dialogue but often makes significant tonal departures, with the added perspective of writer/director Tierney (an openly gay man).

Casting plays a big role: Hudson Williams (Shane) and Connor Storrie (Ilya) are two men of roughly equal height and build. The writing emphasizes a light dom/sub flavor in their relationship that Reid's book never really identifies — for example, Shane roleplays a bellboy in a forced-seduction fantasy with Ilya in the final episode — and provides texture that considerably levels the relationship's playing field.

Shane particularly receives many narrative and performance additions that push him out of the thin Uke stereotype. Williams' active choice to play him as being on the autistic spectrum recontextualizes his shyness and inexperience (Reid said she supports this, but didn't actually write him as such). That reorientation helps make his relationship with Ilya feel like that of… well, that of two adult men. In the source text, Shane acts like an awkward teen well into his twenties.

 










That's not to say the “Heated Rivalry” show is “elevated” compared to Yaoi; it retains the characteristics of the genre consumers have loved for years, including a dramatic but ultimately sweet romance and sex scenes between men ultimately intended for female pleasure. Only here, it's made more relatable for the gay male audience it's about. Bingo: a massive global following.

Just don't call what the show is doing with its female audience new or unexpected — if there's a lesson to learn from manga, it's that women have been “fujoing out” for generations.

Season 1 of “Heated Rivalry” is now streaming on HBO Max.

Don Lemon was “taken into custody by federal agents” on Thursday evening, according to his lawyer.

The former CNN anchor has been charged with conspiracy to deprive rights and violation of the FACE Act — interfering by force of someone's First Amendment rights — during an anti-ICE protest at Cities Church in St. Paul, Minn., on Jan. 18, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told TMZ. 

The 59-year-old was handcuffed in Los Angeles after attending the 2026 Recording Academy Honors.

Lemon, notably, is in California covering this weekend's Grammys.

His lawyer, Abbe Lowell, promised in a statement via Instagram that “Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court.”

He claimed, “Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done. The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable.”

“Instead of investigating the federal agents who killed two peaceful Minnesota protesters, [Renee Good and Alex Pretti], the Trump Justice Department is devoting its time, attention and resources to this case,” the statement continued.

Lowell referred to his client's arrest as an “attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration” — and an “unprecedented attack on the First Amendment.”

The government, notably, sought to charge eight people in connection with the church protest, which included 30 to 40 people seeking to confront pastor David Easterwood, who is the director for St. Paul's ICE field office.

Lemon posted a video from the protest at the time, saying, “I'm sure people here don't like it, but protests are not comfortable.”

That night, Attorney General Pam Bondi tweeted, “If state leaders refuse to act responsibly to prevent lawlessness, this Department of Justice will remain mobilized to prosecute federal crimes and ensure that the rule of law prevails.”

Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, for his part, told Lemon he was “on notice,” claiming on social media that “a house of worship is not a public forum for your protest.”

Last week, a magistrate judge approved charges against three individuals — not Lemon — and those people were arrested as of Jan. 22.

A federal appeals court subsequently denied the Justice Department's right to issue the other five warrants.

Lemon's lawyer wrote in a statement that the “magistrate's reported actions confirm the nature of Don's First Amendment protected work this weekend in Minnesota as a reporter.”

Lemon himself pointed out to Fox News Digital that he'd been “cast as the face of a protest” despite not being “the only reporter there.”

Amid a “barrage of violent threats, along with homophobic and racist slurs,” he insisted, “I stand by my reporting.”

“This much time and energy … would be far better used investigating the tragic death of Renee Nicole Good — the very issue that brought people into the streets in the first place,” Lemon, who was ousted from CNN over a sexism scandal in 2023, concluded.

UPDATED: Don Lemon was taken into custody by federal agents in Los Angeles on Thursday evening, as the journalist was in town to cover the Grammy Awards, his attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement.


	“Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different from what he has always done,” Lowell said.


	It was not immediately clear what charge or charges Lemon is facing. CBS News reported that he was charged with conspiracy to deprive rights.


	Attorney General Pam Bondi has been touting the DOJ's arrest of a number of demonstrators, and posted on X Friday, “At my direction, early this morning federal agents arrested Don Lemon, Trahern Jeen Crews, Georgia Fort, and Jamael Lydell Lundy, in connection with the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota. More details soon.”

	The Justice Department has been attempting to bring charges against Lemon after he covered an anti-ICE protest inside a church in the Twin Cities earlier this month capturing video and interviewing protest participants and church goers.




			Watch on Deadline		







	A magistrate judge and an appeals court had earlier rejected DOJ efforts to charge Lemon, a former CNN anchor who is now an independent journalist. Lemon had said that he expected the Justice Department to continue to pursue charges even after being turned back in their initial attempts.


	“The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable,” Lowell said in a statement. “There is no more important time for people like Don to be doing his work.” 


	His attorney added, “This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand. Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court.”


	Fort, another independent journalist who had covered the protest, posted a video on Facebook as federal agents were at her door. She said that the agents had documentation of an indictment from a grand jury. She said, “I'm going to have to hop off here and surrender to agents. As a member of the press, I filmed the church protest a few weeks ago, and now I am being arrested for that.”

	











	Lemon's arrest is a long-feared escalation on the Trump administration's war on the news media, what First Amendment organizations have warned would be a chilling effect on the free press. Also this month, the Trump administration FBI executed a search warrant on the home of Hannah Natanson, a reporter for The Washington Post, seizing her computer and phones, among other things. Although Natanson was not the target of the investigation, the Post sued to seek the return of her reporting materials.


	Lemon live streamed the protest at Cities Church in St. Paul earlier this month, with demonstrators interrupting the services. Lemon has said that he “had no affiliation” to the protest organization. “I didn't even know they were going to this church until we followed them. We were there chronicling protests,” he said.


	At the time, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department Civil Rights Division, wrote a message to Lemon on X that the First Amendment does “not protect your pseudo journalism of disrupting a prayer service. You are on notice!”


Donald Trump also attacked Lemon, reposting a message on Truth Social that called for the independent journalist to be jailed.


	During the live stream inside the church, Lemon told viewers, “I'm not going to get in the middle of it, because I'm not here as an activist. I'm here as a journalist.”


	CNN reported that Lemon is expected to make a court appearance on Friday. 


	Patrick Schlitz, the chief judge of U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, wrote in a letter earlier this month that “there is no evidence that those two engaged in any criminal behavior or conspired to do so.”


	CNN out out a statement calling Lemon's arrest “unacceptable.” 


	“The FBI's arrest of our former CNN colleague Don Lemon raises profoundly concerning questions about press freedom and the First Amendment,” the network said. 

pic.twitter.com/Yy9IOZRpJU


	The Committee to Protect Journalists' CEO Jodie Ginsberg said in a statement that the arrests were “an egregious attack on the First Amendment and on journalists' ability to do their work. As an international organization, we know that the treatment of journalists is a leading indicator of the condition of a country's democracy. These arrests are just the latest in a string of egregious and escalating threats to the press in the United States — and an attack on people's right to know.” 


	Gabe Rottman, vice president of policy for the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press, said in a statement, “It's obviously concerning any time journalists are arrested in connection with their reporting. To our knowledge, it's unprecedented for the Justice Department to deploy the federal laws it has previously cited in this case against journalistic activity.”


	He noted that in the limited number of cases brought against a journalist documented a protest on private property, they have been trespass cases at the state level. Even then, the charges are “almost always” dropped, he said, and those that go to trial typically see journalists prevail.


	House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries condemned the arrest. 


	He posted on X, “Don Lemon is an accomplished journalist whose urgent work is protected by the First Amendment. There is zero basis to arrest him and he should be freed immediately. The Trump Justice Department is illegitimate and these extremists will all be held accountable for their crimes against the Constitution.”

	











	Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said, “Journalism is not a crime. The Justice Department should investigate the federal agents who killed U.S. citizens in broad daylight, not arrest reporters like Don Lemon. He should be released. It's a spine-chilling assault on press freedom and threatens the public's right to know.”

He was fired from CNN for a reason. He interrupted a church service for a reason. He serves himself only, and will stop at nothing to promote himself.

Yes, sounds exactly like the president

He should be referred to as the Disgraced Don Lemon.

Are we surprised that the first journalist this racist, authoritarian administration arrested was black?

The insanity of what is happening in America today reminds me of a line from a movie , “ and cancel Christmas!” Seems to me the impotent one is having one tantrum after another and will continue to do so until the regime is defeated

This is such a lame case..can pop it with a dull pin.  These hoodlums are now arresting journalists. Step up GOP..or your party will never be elected again.

The audience inside Beverly Hills' Fine Arts Theatre included Chappell Roan, Joachim Trier, Sean Baker, Simon Rex, Meg Stalter, Troye Sivan, Demi Lovato, Gabbriette, Eli Roth and rocker Matt Healy.

	Brat summer hit the big screen in winter in Beverly Hills on Thursday.


	A24 hosted the L.A. premiere of Aidan Zamiri's satirical mockumentary The Moment starring pop superstar Charli xcx — fresh from the film's Sundance world premiere last week and a red carpet outing last night at Wuthering Heights premiere (for which she did the music) — at Fine Arts Theatre. It seemed like all the city's cool kids were there with Moment merch (like brat-branded credit cards) and vape pens in hand. 




	In his brief introduction before the film, Zamiri noted how the location helped juice the festivities. “We love this film so much,” he said. “We love Los Angeles, and fortunately there are a lot of movie stars that live in Los Angeles and a lot of them are in our film, which is great. So, I great to bring them out and show them to you.”

	He welcomed stars Hailey Benton Gates, Kate Berlant, Trew Mullen, Tish Weinstock and Richard Perez to the stage along with his co-writer Bertie Brandes and producer David Hinojosa. He saved a special mention for Kylie Jenner, who makes her acting debut in the film, by calling her “fabulous.” 


	He then welcomed out Charli xcx by saying she “was born to play” her role in The Moment, which she also produced. Zamiri noted they had a blast making the film across 26 production days. “I love this cast so much, I love this crew so much. I'm so grateful you guys get to see it here.”

	











	Zamiri then turned his attention to Charli by saying, “Brat summer, forever?” Her answer? “Maybe!” 


	The L.A. location also boosted the star power in the theater. Those seated for the local premiere included stars Chappell Roan, Charli's Sweat Tour mate Troye Sivan, Demi Lovato, Gabbriette, Matt Healy, Conan Gray, Tove Lo, Scout Willis, Avan Jogia, Meg Stalter, Simon Rex and Terrence O'Connor as well as filmmakers like Sean Baker, Sentimental Value's Joachim Trier and Eli Roth. After the showing, the crowd high-tailed it over to Genghis Cohen on Fairfax Avenue for a packed after party.


The Moment follows Charli as she navigates the complexities of fame and industry pressure while preparing for her arena tour debut and juggling the demands of a new tour documentary and its unpredictable director, played by Alexander Skarsgard. 


	“It felt very vulnerable because I tapped into the most extreme parts of my personality that sometimes I feel the need to hide and diminish,” Charli recently told The Hollywood Reporter's David Canfield. “Being an artist is a really volatile thing. One minute you can be on top of the world and think you are the best and the most important person in the room with the best ideas — a generational artist — and then the next minute you can feel like a piece of shit on someone's shoe. I really feel that in my journey as an artist. To actualize that was hard because I don't like feeling, especially, the latter version of that. It's scary to admit you feel like that.”

The pop star announced her upcoming world tour at the final stop of her 'Small Rooms, Big Nerves' four-date trek.

Hilary Duff is going on a world tour — and for her longtime fans, the news really is what dreams are made of.


	Duff announced her long-awaited return to music last year. The pop icon signed with Atlantic Records in September and soon after shared news of her upcoming album, luck… or something, out Feb. 20. She has released two singles so far, “Mature” and “Roommates.”


	By the start of 2026, it was clear she was more than ready to dive back in and continue building on momentum. In January, Duff embarked on a four-city mini tour including London, Toronto, Brooklyn and Los Angeles. And for her hometown finale, she made sure to save a special surprise.

	Halfway through her set — which featured beloved hits including “Why Not,” “Come Clean” and “What Dreams Are Made Of” — Duff invited three lucky fans on stage to dance with her. And after delivering spot-on choreography, she had a thank you gift waiting for each one of them. With their backs turned to the packed venue, Duff gave each fan a black t-shirt and told them not to turn around until her signal. 


	Once they were all ready, the three fans spun to face the audience and revealed major news, with three words spread out across each shirt: “World Tour Loading…”


	As the crowd erupted in celebratory cheers and applause, Duff couldn't help but beam as she took it all in. “It's a trip,” she later said. “I can't believe I'm here 18 years later.”


	Duff has charted seven songs on the Billboard Hot 100 and all five of her albums have debuted within the Billboard 200's top 5. Metamorphosis (2003) and Most Wanted (2005) both hit No. 1.

The Amazon MGM Studios film, which follows the First Lady in the days leading up to Trump's second inauguration, debuted with support from the president and much of his cabinet. 


							By 

	Carita Rizzo



	At the Kennedy Center premiere for Melania, the Amazon MGM Studios documentary about First Lady Melania Trump, guests heaped overly effusive praise (“Brilliant”) on the subject of the film during the red carpet portion of the evening.


	“Unprecedented” was another word that came up specifically to describe the doc — which reportedly was bought for $40 million and given a marketing budget of $35 million — at Thursday's gala screening.




	“I've been to a number of performances at the Kennedy Center, and I've never seen the whole center branded,” noted one red carpet reporter. Indeed, the Kennedy Center (or the Trump-Kennedy Center, as it was referred to on the invite) had the First Lady's name printed across windows and walls, along with glowing letters across the steps and repeated everywhere. But perhaps the biggest surprise of all was the 34-minutes President Donald Trump and the First Lady dedicated to answering questions on the black carpet, from both mainstream and right-wing media outlets. “Nice to see you,” the president greeted reporters on the press line before announcing, “Tonight is about the First Lady.”

	Asked about the influence his wife wields on him, the president said, “She's somebody that I count on. I speak to a lot of people. I listen to some and I don't listen to others, but she's very influential.” In terms of the film's impact on those who were about to see the film, the First Lady told reporters she hoped the film would be inspirational, especially to other women. “Everybody will connect on a certain level,” she told reporters. “Teenagers can go to see it, young women can go to see it, and be inspired that they could have a family and business, as well.”

	











	Much of the focus amongst the press was on the eye-opening deal Amazon struck with Melania Trump and her newly launched production company Muse Films. President Trump told reporters he “wasn't involved,” while the First Lady said the producers had approached several distributors and “Amazon was the best because they agreed to do theaters all around the world.” The film's director Brett Ratner — directing his first project since being accused of sexual misconduct and harassment at the height of the #MeToo movement — received far more pointed questions about whether he felt like he was part of an act of corporate corruption.


	“That's ridiculous, but it's OK, I'll answer. I can tell you right now, if we were audited and they said, ‘How much was spent on this movie?', this movie is one of the most expensive movies — documentaries — in the genre ever made,” he said. “It wasn't about getting rich. I mean, I think the Trumps are wealthy and successful enough. This is about giving me the ability to hire the best crew in the world, to not only score the film with the best composer… I mean, when you see the movie, you'll go, ‘Oh, we see where the money went now.' This wasn't about corruption. Melania only cared about one thing, making a great movie for audiences.” 


	For Ratner, the project came as a surprise. “I didn't plan it,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “It wasn't something I was pitching. The First Lady and [producer] Marc Beckman asked me to come and consider this and I was so moved by how forthright Melania was and how thoughtful she was. She said, ‘Brett, I want you to do this.' I said, ‘But there's great documentary filmmakers.' She's like, ‘Yeah, but I want it to be for the big screen. I want it to be a movie that audiences around the world can really enjoy.' So, I said, ‘OK, well then I'm right for the job.'”

	











	“If it was just a talking-heads documentary, there's many more great filmmakers that I can suggest to them for, but if you're going to do a movie for the big screen, for audiences around the world — make it something that's entertaining as well as informative and hopefully historical, I'm the guy,” he added. 


	In terms of how he would define success for the project, Ratner told THR, “To me, it's already a success, just the fact that Amazon has agreed to distribute this theatrically. It's a different world today. When I was a kid, all I cared about was box office. ‘How much money is this movie going to make?' And now it's like I've already succeeded. I've grown up a little bit.”


	Ratner wasn't the only guest defending the unprecedented price Amazon paid for the doc that opens in 1,500 theaters worldwide on Friday (so far to rather modest ticket sales). South Africa won't be on the list  of countries as the film was abruptly pulled from the schedule on Thursday. 


	“Amazon is a business and they're in the business to make money, and I think they will make money on this film,” said Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. “It also has an inestimable value in my view, for its cultural impact. I mean, to have a documentary of a First Lady, a behind-the-scenes portrayal, I think there's great value to that and I think it transcends dollar figures. I think Amazon's done a good thing to the culture.”


	Johnson, attending with his wife Kelly Lary, hoped viewers would glean what the two of them know from their personal relationship with the Trumps. “She's one of the most gracious people we know,” he said of the First Lady. “She's very dignified and poised. She gets attacked all the time politically, but she takes it in stride and she's, I think, a great model for other women and a great representative for America. So, this will be a great film.” Asked by THR if the timing of the premiere gave him pause — following ICE's shooting of protestor Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and the nationwide outrage that has followed — Johnson brushed it off. “No. This was pre-planned and she can't account for weather events and madness in Congress. She's doing her thing, so we applaud it. We're here to support it and we're excited to be here,” he said.

	











	Johnson was not the only member of the Trump administration to attend the premiere, with other guests including attendance were Pete Hegseth, Lee Zeldin and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “She's been portrayed as this one-dimensional character, but that's not who she is,” Kennedy told THR. “She's been very kind to me and [wife] Cheryl [Hines] since we moved to Washington. Within the administration, she's been one of the primary motivators and drivers for my agenda for children's health, for better food. I've worked with her a lot on foster care, which is her passion, and I'm excited to learn more about her.”


	Kennedy also defended the recent renaming of the building dedicated to his uncle President John F. Kennedy. “This center was launched after my uncle's death because of his commitment to the arts, to making America a cultural center. President Trump has that same ambition. He's spending a lot of time thinking about it,” he said. “I have bigger fish to fry. If I can save one kid, it's better than the name of a building.” 


	And though a Saturday screening of the documentary at the White House drew criticism, the president did not seem bothered by the events of the past month. Asked how he believed the month of January would affect his legacy, he said, “I think that the legacy is very strong right now. The safest country we've had, the strongest military, doing better than we've ever done before. I think it's going to be a great legacy.”

Ariana Grande poked fun at a Photoshop fail in cheeky new social media comments.

Fan instagram account @ourpinkwitchh shared a pair of Vogue Japan snapshots of the “Wicked” star in a cream-colored floral print Dior mini skirt and top, daintily raising her left hand — which, in a closeup crop, seemingly had the faint outline of a sixth finger.

The hitmaker wore a sheer white glove, and several of her hand tattoos were visible in the shot. 

The fan account questioned, “who's responsible for giving ariana 6 fingers…. 😭” to which Grande replied in the comments thread, “holy s–t.”

She hilariously added in a subsequent comment, “oh my goodness how exciting! i've been saying i need some extra appendages so that i can start an album ! thankful for this.” 

Fans were quick to respond to Grande's clever comments, with one joking, “i knew you were hiding something,” and another chiming in, “Ariana AI Grande.” 

“This is my wallpaper and I just noticed 😭” quipped a third, while a fourth confessed, “I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE.” 

A rep for Vogue did not immediately return Page Six's request for comment. 

It's unclear where the original image came from — an almost identical photo from Vogue Japan's stunning new spread featuring the singer did not have the hint of a second pinkie. Grande, 32, channeled retro vibes in several dresses in the high fashion collection of photos.

The multi-hypenate talent — who collected a rising star award at the Palm Springs Film Festival earlier this month — previously joked about how she's enhanced her youthful appearance in the past.

“You don't know how much it means to me,” she said after Jennifer Coolidge summoned her to the stage, according to People.

“I've been performing since I was a child, so I never thought at the age of 31 I would be hearing the words ‘rising star' again, so I wanted to start by thanking my two friends: Botox and Juvederm.”

Grande isn't the only celebrity to be caught up in an apparent photoshop gaffe. 

In August, fans called out Kris Jenner for an apparent sixth toe in an Instagram photo — and daughters Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner were previously called out for also having six toes in a 2019 ad for their fragrance collab.

Celebs including Princess of Wales Kate Middleton, “Real Housewives of New York City” alum Ramona Singer, reality star Khloé Kardashian, and “RHONJ” personality Teresa Giudice have also been accused of photoshop missteps in recent years.

Jake Broido claims Warner Music Group has "obfuscated and obstructed" his attempts to collect proper payment for the chart-topper.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



	A backing vocalist on Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's chart-topping Furious 7 soundtrack hit “See You Again” is suing Warner Music Group (WMG) and NBCUniversal, alleging he was “cheated out of royalty payments and downstream compensation” for years.


	Jake Broido claims in a Thursday (Jan. 29) federal court lawsuit that he provided the so-called gang vocals on “See You Again,” which scored Paul Walker's famous final scene in 2015's Furious 7 and reigned atop the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks. But he alleges WMG and NBCUniversal misclassified his contributions on the song's registration paperwork, ultimately depriving him of royalties and licensing fees.


	“It is, of course, not surprising that Broido's efforts to get paid have been, for a decade, obfuscated and obstructed by Warner,” reads the complaint. “That is the long history of the music industry; to make executives rich at the expense of artists.”


	Broido alleges he was working as an administrative staffer at WMG in early 2015 when Puth approached him asking if he could sing gang vocals, a recording technique where voices are layered to sound like crowd noise. Broido, who had been studying gang vocals for years, says he happily went into the studio with Puth and sang what would ultimately become part of “See You Again.”


	Session vocalists like Broido are supposed to collect royalties through the AFM & SAG-AFTRA Intellectual Property Rights Distribution Fund. But Broido's name didn't make it onto the “See You Again” AFM Fund registration paperwork; instead, the files merely listed “three A&R staffers” as background singers.


	Broido alleges that WMG, whose subsidiary Atlantic Records released the Furious 7 soundtrack, deliberately doctored the AFM Fund paperwork because it hadn't secured a critical work-for-hire agreement from him. According to the lawsuit, WMG wanted to hide this “embarrassing failure” from its studio partners at NBCUniversal.


	The result, alleges Broido, is that he wasn't paid crucial royalties that should have been distributed to him by the AFM Fund. He says WMG also misclassified “See You Again” as “non-theatrical” on the registration paperwork, which deprived him of the chance to participate in lucrative licensing negotiations.


	“Warner Music made misleading statements, partial royalty payments and assurances to Broido that it was pursuing an investigation, including that it would ‘look into this' and that it would ‘follow up,' only for Warner Music to ultimately ‘ghost' Broido,” reads the complaint. “In reality, Warner Music's assurances were merely a scheme to conceal facts from Broido in an attempt to ‘wait out the clock.'”


	Broido is now suing WMG and NBCUniversal for breach of contract, fraud and conspiracy. The lawsuit also levels breach of fiduciary duty claims against the AFM Fund, alleging it was “asleep at the switch” and made “absurd and negligent decisions that allowed Warner Music and NBCUniversal to cheat Broido.”


	The background singer is seeking unspecified financial damages through the litigation, as well as a declaration that he is a co-owner of the “See You Again” copyrights.


	Reps for WMG, NBCUniversal and the AFM Fund did not immediately return requests for comment on Thursday. Khalifa and Puth are not facing any legal claims in the case.

Eighty-two percent of unionized staffers voted to empower leaders to call a work stoppage, just months before the labor group is set to face the likes of Netflix and Paramount.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


	The Writers Guild of America West could soon have another strike on their hands, but not one involving Hollywood's studios or streamers.


	Rather, the labor group's own staff union — the union within the union, as it were — on Thursday authorized a strike as they claim that negotiations over their first contract have stalled as management has engaged in bad-faith bargaining. Eighty-two percent of the 100 staffers that participated voted to authorize a strike, the Writers Guild Staff Union announced on Instagram on Thursday.

	“If management won't bargain in good faith with us at the table, we will see them on the picket line,” the post stated.

	A strike authorization does not guarantee a strike, but it does allow union leaders to call one if they deem it necessary. 


	In a statement, the WGA West refuted allegations that management had engaged in bad-faith bargaining and said it had offered “comprehensive proposals with numerous union protections and improvements to compensation and benefits.”


	The union added, “Public claims suggesting otherwise are inaccurate, and allegations of unfair labor practices are without merit. WGAW respects the staff's right to engage in collective activity, and hopes to reach a first contract agreement with the staff union soon.”


	The WGSU says that it has been negotiating its first contract with the union since September 2025 and is still fighting for “basic protections” like grievance processes, AI protections and raises for union members, according to a public flier seen by THR.

	











	“At this point in negotiations, we should be in alignment on these issues. Yet for nearly five months, WGAW management has dismissed our staff's needs and engaged in bad faith surface bargaining with no intent to reach a fair contract,” the flier stated.


	The group added that management is attempting to “keep near-total control over our wages and working conditions” and that staffers “will not stand by and let this happen.”


	The timing is hardly fortuitous for the union. The WGA's east and west coast branches are just a few months out from entering the first negotiations with Hollywood studios and streamers since their 148-day strike in 2023. The union is expected to start talks on March 16, and a few months prior would typically be the time for the labor group to cement priorities and strategize, not to face their own internal labor battles.


	Indeed, a group of self-described WGA captains — volunteer members that communicate union messaging to rank-and-file peers — commented on WGSU's Instagram post expressing their solidarity. “We've got your back. Always,” it stated. The WGA relied heavily on its captain system during its negotiations in 2023.


	The WGSU is affiliated with the Pacific Northwest Staff Union. The union was voluntarily recognized by management after a card count showed majority support for the effort in April 2025.

Five additional artists have been confirmed as surprise performers as well.

	While Cardi B will likely be at San Francisco's Super Bowl LX to cheer on her boo Stefon Diggs and his Patriots teammates, the Grammy-winning rapper is also making time for some work in the Bay Area.


	Fanatics announced Thursday (Jan. 29) that Cardi is slated to perform at Michael Rubin's Fanatics Super Bowl Party in San Francisco on Feb. 7. Five surprise artists are also booked to perform throughout the afternoon.


	Fittingly enough, Cardi also performed at the Fanatics Super Bowl Party in Atlanta in 2019, which saw Patriots owner Robert Kraft join her onstage. That year saw the Patriots defeat the Los Angeles Rams at Super Bowl LIII, so it's safe to say Cardi is hoping that history repeats itself, with Diggs and the Pats lifting the Lombardi Trophy.

	











	Michael Rubin's parties are always star-studded, and San Francisco should be no different next month. In the past, celebrities like Jay-Z, Kim Kardashian, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Brady, Kevin Hart, Kendall Jenner, Drake, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez, Justin Bieber, Emily Ratajkowski, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Usher, Aaron Judge and Jack Harlow have been in attendance.




	Super Bowl LX will be a rematch of 2015, with the New England Patriots facing off against the Seattle Seahawks on Feb. 8.


	Cardi B has been cheering on Diggs, who's a star wide receiver for the Pats, every step of the way this NFL Playoffs. She even joined the celebration with the Patriots on the field in Denver following the team's AFC Championship victory over the Broncos.


	Cardi's Fanatics performance could double as tour prep, as she's slated to kick off her Little Miss Drama Tour just a few days later on Feb. 11 in Palm Desert, California, at Acrisure Arena.

Formally ambitious and narratively elliptical, “If I Go Will They Miss Me” uses a strained father-son relationship as a lens to survey, and elevate, Black Angelino life. Expanding upon his 2022 Sundance Short Film Jury Award-winning short by the same name, writer-director Walter Thompson-Hernández adopts a painter's eye towards the local Watts community. He affords faces with warm close-ups and captures individuals and groups alike in static celebratory portraits. He treats the Nickerson Gardens housing projects, the film's primary setting, like a safe haven, a place where expressions of love and conflict, murmurs of gossip and bullshit, are allowed to roam free. Thompson-Hernández acknowledges that while Watts might be a small community, a relative sliver of greater Los Angeles, imagination flourishes in the most circumscribed places.

Case in point: drawing and crafts are creative outlets for Lil Ant (Bodhi Dell), a sensitive twelve-year old whose interest in Greek mythology intersect with the return of his father, Big Ant (J. Alphonse Nicholson), from a stint in prison. Upon his homecoming, Lil Ant compares his father to Odysseus arriving home after years at war; later, he likens him to Poseidon, and subsequently himself to the God's trusty winged horse Pegasus. Unnerved by his son's reverence, Big Ant keeps his distance from the boy and subtly pressures him to toughen up and abandon his artistic pursuits.

While trauma and toxic masculinity linger like specters in the background of “If I Go,” Thompson-Hernández permits them to merely contextualize rather than overwhelm the drama. Case in point: Big Ant's concern about his son's interest in art doesn't stem from his discomfort with its feminine implications, or that it might make him a potential target away from home. Instead, it connects with his fear that the two are more alike than he initially believed. Big Ant was also a creative adolescent until a peer-pressured assault forced him into the criminal justice system; he sees his son's passion as a harbinger of doom that will force him down a similarly harsh path. His fears intensify when he discovers that they both see the same hallucinatory vision of the neighborhood kids acting like planes, complete with outstretched arms as wings, awaiting taking off on makeshift runways.

Born and raised in Huntington Park, Thompson-Hernández grew up beneath the LAX flight path and the roar of planes departing from and arriving at the airport dominated his soundscape. Subsequently, the filmmaker became enamored with airplanes and transferred that same fascination onto Lil Ant, who eyes the planes overhead with palpable yearning and, at one point, shoplifts a toy plane from a store. The dreamlike image of kids-as-planes stresses the various “flights” that permeate “If I Go”: the emotional journey of adolescence, the physical departures of adults, and people's imagined escapes for themselves far into the future.

 










Informed and influenced by the works of Black filmmakers like Charles Burnett, Kahlil Joseph, Barry Jenkins, and Spike Lee, as well as visual artists like Jacob Lawrence and Kerry James Marshall, Thompson-Hernández brings considerable rigor to his sophomore feature. His frame exhibits a restrained beauty that honors and uplifts, rather than condescends to, its environment; in other words, he respects his audience. Thompson-Hernández's background as a feature writer for the New York Times has also supplied him with a keen ear for the spoken phrase, expressed in the film's rich and believable dialogue, as well as a facility with performers of all backgrounds. Everyone from seasoned actors like Nicholson and Danielle Brooks, who plays matriarch Lozita, to the various non-professionals that populate the frame evince a palpable comfort with being on screen, which allows them to fully inhabit their respective characters. A strong foundation of stylized realism affords “If I Go” to integrate the fantastic without rendering it incoherent, illustrating a quiet confidence on behalf of its cast and crew.

Yet, the clunky meanings behind such potently surreal imagery points to the noble faults in “If I Go.” The overly obvious aviation motif, for example, might have had more room to breathe if it wasn't competing with the Grecian myths that Lil Ant uses to explain his family's dynamic. As much as Thompson-Hernández strives to dovetail the two metaphors into a cohesive thematic framework, they feel stubbornly separated from each other, especially as “If I Go” develops. 

 










While “If I Go” deserves praise for eschewing traditional three-act structure and using lyrical vignettes as a lodestar instead of an engineered plot, its central parental relationship remains frustratingly schematic, even at its most heartfelt. There are no real surprises that occur between Big and Lil Ant, our viewpoint into the film's world, or even between Big Ant and Lozita, whose relationship feels real but too familiar. Characters keep secrets from each other, but there are no secrets from the audience. You always know why Big Ant acts distant or aggressive towards his son, and oftentimes when it will occur, as well as the ways it will (fail to) resolve. Highpoints, such as when Big Ant quietly admires the craftsmanship of his son's Pegasus wings before rejecting them for confused reasons, unproductively blend together with facile ones, like a signposted scene of physical abuse.

“If I Go” exhibits frequently strong formal and writerly instincts that the lapses — Dell and Nicholson's affected voiceover, the choice to chintzily animate Lil Ant's sketches, the bouts of flowery writing—feel especially disruptive. Thompson-Hernández's discreet abstention from stereotypical depictions of poverty and gang life would be notable on its own, but that he de facto replaces them with visions of urban stableman who view horses like healers is a powerful substitution. Moreover, his decision to embrace the incompleteness of life as “If I Go” reaches its conclusion instead of using tragedy to artificially juice the drama suggests a refreshingly mature artistic worldview, something that the Sundance Film Festival, not to mention the film industry as a whole, could stand to support.

 










“If I Go Will They Miss Me” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Yelps and screams abounded at the performance I saw.

You should know that I am not the target audience for Paranormal Activity, a stage adaptation of the Paramount Pictures movie franchise running at Shakespeare Theatre Company through February 7. I am a wimp, a wuss, a weenie, with a time-tested talent for weaseling out of movie nights with even a whiff of public fright. But more so, I am a sucker for spectacle, and this Paranormal Activity — which leans heavily on illusion and ambient creepiness instead of the “found-footage” format of its film iterations — is a horror hoot.

Playwright Levi Holloway, whose Grey House haunted Broadway in 2023, has cooked up an original story that finds newlyweds Lou (Cher Álvarez) and James (Travis A. Knight) settling into a life in London, where they've been placed in stately corporate housing. They decamped from Chicago, where Lou's mental health had deteriorated from an unshakable sense of dread, but even with new digs and medication, spooks emerge with a seemingly strong hunger for blood. Lou tries to keep the spirits at bay — at one point enlisting a medium-turned-podcast-host Mrs. Cotgrave (Kate Fry), whose refrain is “Places aren't haunted, people are” — while James attempts the same with his devout mother Carolanne (Shannon Cochran), who insists on visiting the couple from her home in Florida. Initially skeptical, James doesn't take long to accept that something is amiss. As the spirits take hold of their home, the couple is left to salvage their fracturing relationship as each learns who they really married. 

Typically, stage productions are built around texts, but when the task is to recreate an expected experience from existing intellectual property, in this case, the Paranormal Activity movie franchise, nimbleness is required, and it seems that Holloway's play was instead purpose-built to deliver that experience foremost. That's not a bad thing, though, and he impressively hits the necessary notes to create a story that is both believable and able to tee up the night's biggest tricks. Holloway veers away from referential pastiche by rooting the story firmly in today, and delightfully invokes everyday technology to remind us that even if we're not being haunted, we're still being watched; Alexa, Zoom, FaceTime, and even “targeted ads” make appearances. In a genre known for tropes, he does an especially good job of developing Lou and James, and Álvarez and Knight are both giving truthful performances even as their surroundings become more extraordinary. Fry and Cochran also do their best with their characters, who are mostly devices, but Holloway's naturalism slips noticeably with puzzling, folksy lines like “You both look like flapjacks left in a skillet overnight” that land with a thud. And not all of the various threads he pulls on throughout the two-hour play are tied up by the play's slapdash end, leaving some plot questions lingering and the moral of James and Lou's story muddy. 

It makes little difference, though. Originally directed by Felix Barrett and restaged here by Holloway, Paranormal Activity is relentless in building intoxicating anticipation from the first blaring sound cue. Even as the play cascades through a series of climaxes, one remains on tenterhooks, anxiously awaiting the moving of an object (Chris Fisher is illusions director and pulls out all the stops) or the roar of an alarm (sound design is by Gareth Fry) or a shadow on the wall (video/projections by Luke Halls) or a blackout (lighting by Anna Watson). Fly Davis' house set is big, expensive-looking, and — I don't know how else to put it — alive. Downstairs, a kitchen melts into a vestibule, then into a living room, in one continuous space with no walls, only furniture obstacles. Upstairs, Lou and James can finally find privacy from each other in a bedroom, bathroom, or nursery, but the same doors and walls that allow them to hide from each other may also be hiding the things they don't want to face. Try to stop your eye from darting around the space, asking yourself whether a spirit crossed a wall (did it?) or if something is about to move in the darkness (will it?). 

Across town at Studio Theatre, Octet, a chamber musical about “digital dependency,” has audiences locking away their devices to guarantee a “phone-free experience.” Paranormal Activity demands something similar of its audience, though no pouch is required; it moves so quickly and promises so intently that, without saying so, its directive is clear: you'd better not look away for a second. Given the scale of the spectacle, it's not a tall order, but the results are thrilling nonetheless. Yelps and screams abounded at the performance I saw, which inadvertently helped this wimp/wuss/weenie (and others like me, I'm sure) remember that it's only a play. 

I expected to be surprised, but not in the way I ultimately was. At its best, theater is a kind of seance between the audience and the play, and even with its frozen-in-celluloid roots, Paranormal Activity facilitates that connection here with great success. There's a reason we return to Agatha Christie's murder mystery The Mousetrap and Noel Coward's supernatural comedy Blithe Spirit — a tradition that Paranormal Activity, simultaneously playing in London's West End, now joins. Audiences don't need to scream, but they do want a reason to lean forward and listen. Even so, somehow jump scares feel good in a place like this.

Running Time: Two hours and 10 minutes, including one intermission.

Paranormal Activity plays through February 7, 2025, in the Shakespeare Theatre Company's Harman Hall, 610 F Street NW, Washington, DC. Tickets (starting at $43) can be purchased online, by calling the Box Office at 202-547-1122, or through TodayTix.

The Asides program is online here.

David Romero had been thinking about writing a book when he got inspiration from an unlikely place: the Green Day album “Dookie.” While scanning the song titles, Romero misread the track “Emenius Sleepus” and it sparked something in his imagination.

“I read ‘Enemy Sleeps' and thought, ‘Wow, that's so fascinating. What does that mean?” Romero said during a recent interview. “I thought that it sounded really cool.”

Shortly after, the book began to take shape, with new elements often arriving in vivid daydreams and eerie nightmares.

Romera said one of those elements came from the Bible's Ten Commandments (don't murder, be nice to your neighbor, etc.), and another from growing up in Diamond Bar. The result is his debut novel, “The Enemy Sleeps,” a supernatural thriller set in a fictional Southern Californian town.

The neo-noir, set to debut Feb. 5, tells the story of a Mexican American family who moves from the L.A. neighborhood of Boyle Heights to the fictional, sleepy suburban town of Harper, where they face suspicion because of their race. If moving into a new community isn't stressful enough, there is also a killer on the loose, dubbed the “Harper Murderer,” and a list of racist, xenophobic locals who seem like prime suspects for the killing of a young Salvadorian girl.

“A lot of the characters in this book, and the way that religion shapes community and challenges hypocrisies in suburbia, was inspired by ‘To Kill a Mockingbird,‘ including the town's name, Harper, a nod to the author Harper Lee,” he said.

In the book, a 16-year-old character named Edward is coming of age and beginning to understand what it means to be seen as Mexican American by the world at large. Edward's journey was partly inspired by Romero and his friends' upbringing, as they tried to navigate their identities with little understanding of what society had ascribed to them based on their ethnicity and race.

As Romero grew older and went to college, he took a sociocultural course that began to open his eyes to his Mexican American background. Though he had Mexican lineage, Romero passed as White. He said he felt disconnected from his culture and ignorant about a lot of things relating to his racial background, despite being the nephew of Frank Romero, one of the most influential pioneers of the Chicano Art Movement. He said his only reference to that culture was visiting his grandparents' house in Boyle Heights.

“What I did with this book, over time, is that I started to develop a counterhistory of a family that would be like an alternate version of my own,” he said, adding that his dad had left Boyle Heights and often regretted it. Romero wanted to tell a story of a family that didn't leave their community while exploring pressures of assimilation, such as speaking and dressing “White,” all of which he experienced in his own life.

Romero also researched the communities that made up his hometown of Diamond Bar after coming across a plaque at his hometown's supermarket that recounted its history. It told the story of how the town had been a ranch where Indigenous communities lived before Spanish settlers arrived, and of its existence in Mexico before that.

He was also inspired by Southern California ghost stories and urban legends, including the tales of Carbon Canyon, which is said to be a hotspot for ghost sightings and to have a mysterious, eerie atmosphere. In the book, a canyon serves as a supernatural focal point, suggesting that the ghosts haunting the town were murdered there.

“Whether you believe in them or not, ghosts are a fascinating way to explore history,” Romero said. “It remains such a great way of learning about history, and it's interesting that without this kind of fascination with the dead and with ghosts, people may not be interested in history at all.”

Other folklore subjects include the coyote, which appears on the book's cover. Coyotes symbolize many things, including the term for smugglers of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border and a spiritual guide or trickster. “The Enemy Sleeps” also features a prologue focused on the coyote, an animal the town is trying to get rid of, even though it was native to the land before humans arrived.

He hopes that his book, which centers on a Mexican American family's experience fused with supernatural elements, will inspire readers to champion their own cultures and stories, including the influences of their hometowns.

“I'd appreciate it if people read the book and developed curiosity and look into the history of where they live and contemplate how it might influence the present,” he said. “Ultimately, at the end, I want it to make the case for greater empathy for others.”

By Leslie Kean and Ralph Blumenthal

OVER A LARGE BOX of untouched donuts in Washington's Longworth House Office Building, Congressional representatives sat rapt as a visiting Brazilian neurosurgeon described what it was like to stare back at the large lilac-colored eyes of a highly intelligent, nonhuman being.

So, not your usual Capitol Hill meeting.

The closed-door session on Jan. 15 brought together three members of Congress seeking greater government transparency on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, long called UFOs, and a group of Brazilians who say they witnessed the crash of an otherworldly spacecraft and later encountered its nonhuman occupants.

Coming thirty years after the striking events, the private Washington meeting (to which we alone had media access), followed by a public press conference five days later, raised the prospect of unprecedented Brazilian-American cooperation in unraveling the mysteries of one of the best researched—and shocking—UFO cases on record.

The witnesses included the highly respected neurosurgeon, a forensic pathologist, and a geography teacher. They were brought to the United States by filmmaker James Fox, who interviewed more than two dozen witnesses for a new feature documentary that expands on a 2022 version of his film Moment of Contact. Fox has been investigating the case, with his Brazilian counterpart Marco Aurelio Leal, for over two decades.

“This could settle the debate once and for all that we're not alone,” Fox told the packed news conference, which he organized at the National Press Club on Jan. 20.

The story is this: On January 13, 1996, in the countryside outside the municipality of Varginha, Brazil, the geography teacher—also an ultralight pilot—reported seeing a cylindrical craft trailing smoke and crashing to Earth. A week later, three girls walking home through a vacant lot reported encountering a cowering creature with reddish eyes and brown oily skin that reportedly communicated its suffering through its eyes. Before long, the streets of Varginha were filled with military trucks and emergency vehicles amid rumors of the capture of two nonhuman beings, one later hospitalized, and a clandestine American operation that spirited them out of Brazil.

Fox said that now, for the first time, he knows the names of those who were in possession of videos of the purported nonhuman entities. Despite the difficulties in obtaining them, he said, “I never give up.”

Susan Gough, a Pentagon spokesperson, did not reply to requests for comment.

The Department of Defense All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), with a mission to scientifically investigate UAP, stated in a 2024 report that “none of these investigations (including USG, foreign, and U.S. academic efforts) reached the conclusion that any of the UAP reports indicated extraterrestrial origin.”

But AARO may not have a free hand. As Fox recalled, in 2024, he met with AARO staff to discuss a video staff members had obtained. They discussed the Varginha case, among others. At one point, AARO director Dr. Jon T. Kosloski came into the room. Fox says he asked Kosloski if there was a plan to inform the public about “what we are ultimately dealing with.” Kosloski replied, “I can't part my hair without the approval of the DOD. And you can quote me on that.”

There is no question that the Varginha case lacks hard data. No one has yet been able to come up with photographs or videos, physical evidence, official documentation, or medical records that could help verify the episode. Yet over two dozen witnesses to many aspects of the case have come forward independently, providing pieces of a puzzle that seem to fit together to tell a compelling story.

The Congressional meeting, held in Tennessee Representative Tim Burchett's office, drew two fellow Republicans—Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, chairwoman of the House's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, and Eric Burlison of Missouri—along with staff members. Two Democrats with a longstanding interest in UAP issues—Jared Moskowitz of Florida, and Andre Carson of Indiana, a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence—were invited but unable to attend.

“Can you take it from the top?” Luna asked the visiting neurosurgeon, Dr. Italo Venturelli, 73, at the beginning of the meeting, “Who brought the being in? I want detail about what the interaction was, from point A to point B.”

Burchett also pressed a question: “Was the being able to communicate in any way? Was it telepathic or anything like that?”

Dr. Italo (as he prefers to be called), who was on duty that day in Regional Hospital in Varginha, said the captured being was initially treated by his colleague, Dr. Marcos Vinico Neves, who sutured a wound on its cranium. Neves died in 2018, and no medical records were kept of this procedure, according to Dr. Italo.

He says he was shown a brief black and white video of the patient and then spent three or four minutes at its bedside, having been asked to visually examine it after the procedure.

“I've been a doctor for forty-six years and have performed thousands of surgeries,” Dr. Italo said in an interview before the meeting. “To me, it was obvious that this was not a human being.”

“It looked like a seven-year-old child,” the neurosurgeon told the representatives with help from a translator in attendance. “Its eyes were lilac color. Both eyes and the cranium were teardrop-shaped. It transmitted calm and tranquility.”

The doctor said it seemed to him that his patient was at peace with everything that was happening, and that he sensed it possessed intelligence greater than his own. He also described feeling as if he were looking at an angel.

“I wouldn't say it communicated telepathically; it communicated empathetically,” he said, “through its eyes.”

“What did the hands look like?” Luna asked.

Dr. Italo demonstrated, holding up three fingers and a thumb.

He said he had fixated on the eyes, which seemed to communicate power, concentration, and compassion. At one point, the being looked at him, looked out the window at the blue sky, and then looked back at the doctor, as if to communicate its wish to be released.

Burlison, taking notes, asked if it was wearing clothing. Bare above the sheet, said Dr. Italo. The skin was white, the torso was slim, and there were no nipples. A small mouth. A sliver of ears.

Burlison asked if any other medical staff or doctors could corroborate the story.

Yes, said Dr. Italo, but most doctors are afraid to speak out because they have been threatened, or for fear of damage to their careers.

“It's very important to get the others,” Burlison said.

Dr. Italo said that a near-fatal heart attack and other recent medical issues persuaded him to break his silence last year and provide his full story to Fox for the first time, even though he still works full-time at Regional Hospital.

Carlos de Sousa, the geography teacher and ultralight pilot, told the representatives that he saw a “cigar-shaped” craft that he first thought was a blimp with a lateral tear trailing white smoke and struggling to stay aloft before crashing near a highway.

He said he drove over to help any survivors and was overtaken by a strong odor of ammonia and rotten eggs. Picking up a piece of what looked like aluminum, de Sousa said he was able to crumple it in his fist, but it then immediately sprang back to its original shape. Military trucks arrived within minutes. A soldier approached him and aimed a gun at his head, demanding, “Leave now, or I'll split your skull,” de Sousa said. Dropping the fragment, de Sousa fled, but said he was confronted shortly afterwards by two men in an unmarked dark vehicle who threatened his family and demanded his silence. He did not speak about the incident for decades.

A third Brazilian visitor, Dr. Armando Fortunato, who has been a forensic pathologist and criminal medical examiner for the Civil Police for over three decades, told the representatives that he had performed an autopsy on a young military police officer, Marco Chereze, who had grabbed one of the beings during its capture and then died a few weeks later from a severe infection after it inadvertently scratched him.

Dr. Armando, as he likes to be called, said a legal request has been filed to exhume Chereze's body with hopes of collecting bacteria—or even DNA samples—that could undergo further analysis.

Dr. Armando handed the representatives a signed statement from Dr. João Janini, 89, a specialist in pathological anatomy whose biography states he has performed over 50,000 autopsies. Janini attested that he had found a rare form of a bacterium “of extremely high aggressiveness and lethality” in the tissue samples from Chereze. The characteristics of the infection went so far beyond the limits of what is conventional that, in his opinion, “it raises the hypothesis of its alien origin.”

Accounts from former U.S. officials involving alleged UAP crash retrievals and related recoveries of nonhuman bodies have continued to surface, although the Defense Department dismisses them as unfounded.

In a 2023 Congressional hearing, David Grusch, a veteran of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, and the Defense Department's UAP Task Force, testified under oath that the U.S. has retrieved vehicles and “biologics” of exotic origin.

“Biologics came with some of these recoveries,” he asserted, referring to nonhuman bodies and tissue samples, citing “people with direct knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program.” Since then, other former officials with high security clearances have echoed his statements, sometimes under oath.

Kirk McConnell, who served for 37 years on the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the House Intelligence Committee until retiring in early 2024, opened the Jan. 20 press event. He was among the staff from the two Senate Committees who collaboratively investigated the UAP issue on behalf of senators from both parties.

McConnell told the audience that reports similar to those from the Varginha case reached senators and staff conducting these investigations. The interested senators, who included now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio, held meetings and interviews in sensitive compartmented intelligence facilities “with very credible sources reporting both direct and secondhand knowledge of the reality of highly intelligent nonhuman beings, government retrievals and reverse engineering of craft not made by human beings, and the recovery of bodies of non-human beings,” McConnell said. 

He had attended some of these classified meetings.

The reports provided to Congress included alleged hidden government activities similar to those recounted in the Varginha case, stretching across many decades. “So what these folks are going to tell you today are astounding, but they're not the only credible testimony about such events,” McConnell said.

In a video statement screened at the press conference, Jacques Vallée, a French-American computer scientist who has worked on projects at NASA and DARPA, and has been a leading thinker and writer on UFOs for over fifty years, cited a “data warehouse system” that he and a scientific team compiled for the Defense Intelligence Agency.

In addition to over 200,000 reports of anomalous objects in flight, Vallée said the database includes “hundreds of reports of creatures, live or dead, associated with crashed or landed vehicles of unknown provenance, including some similar to those in Varginha,” and that creatures in other documented cases breathed air normally.

Vallée said that the Varginha case is similar to many classified cases in scientific and medical records, but it also “presents exceptional new knowledge”, especially “in the professional description of the anatomical and behavioral features of the live creature recovered by authorities within a short time of the crash, and to the point of its death.”

During the private discussion in Burchett's office, Dr. Italo said he had learned that the being he saw was taken to ESA military base, then to Campinas, and then to the States.

“All the people we talked to said the exact same thing,” Fox told the representatives.

Luna said Congress should seek Air Force flight logs and a landing permit to confirm any American retrieval operation of bodies and crash debris from Varginha, although it is uncertain whether any paper trail exists.

Later, at the press conference, Col. Fred Claussen, a retired and highly decorated U.S. Air Force colonel who held a top-secret clearance, outlined ways the alleged secret U.S. mission might yet be documented. He said that a Brazilian air traffic controller, Marco Feres, reported that on or about Jan. 20, 1996, a U.S. Air Force cargo plane, most likely a C17, took off from an American base and landed at Viracopos airport in Campinas to pick up an unusual cargo before departing for an unknown location in the U.S.

Any such cargo plane mission, the colonel said, would require paperwork from Air Mobility Command at Scott AFB in Illinois and the Air Mobility Wing at Charleston AFB in South Carolina. Air refueling would require more documentation, as would an international flight plan to Brazil, even if the mission were classified, Claussen said, adding that at Campinas, there would need to be more refueling records and another international flight plan.

Even without a paper trail, he said he believed that thirty to forty Americans involved with the operation should have direct knowledge of this flight and its purpose.

“Here is my plea,” Claussen concluded. “If you were a participant and have knowledge of this mission, come forward.”

McConnell followed by saying there was general misunderstanding that nondisclosure agreements signed by intelligence figures barred them from sharing their information about UAP recoveries with Congress. They were not liable, he said, if they presented their accounts in properly secure facilities like SCIFs. In fact, he said, “It's illegal to withhold information from Congress.”

No one has ever been prosecuted for providing classified information to Congress, McConnell said. In fact, the President himself “could affirm disclosure to Congress with the stroke of a pen or [on] social media.”

While greater UAP disclosure has been widely regarded as a bipartisan issue in Congress, “we're not yet at the tipping point for most members of Congress,” McConnell said.

A joint evidence-seeking operation between Brazilians and Americans could be in the works. Brazilian Senator Eduardo Girão, who represents the coastal state of Ceará and led a Brazilian Senate hearing on UAP in 2022, came to Washington to meet with members of Congress and attend the press event.

Acting as a private citizen and not representing the Brazilian Senate, Girão spoke from the podium and commended the three Brazilian witnesses for their courage in speaking out.

During a break, he spoke with Burlison, who said he had gotten up at 4 a.m. that morning to fly from Missouri so he could attend the news conference and present a public statement (the other members did not fly back in time to attend).

“Are there videos that you think you might be able to get access to, any other material evidence?” Burlison asked Girão.

“I'm going to try,” Girão said.

The two discussed the need for a joint effort to acquire tangible evidence that could help validate the incident. Burlison described having seen interesting UAP videos, but “nothing that is definitive 4K.” He told the Brazilian senator about key American officials who have come forward, including the current Secretary of State.

Obtaining the evidence he would like to see has been difficult, Burlison said, because “there are several government entities that are controlling this and some are willing to be more cooperative, so unfortunately we're not getting everything.”

Six other Brazilians who wanted to provide testimony on the Varginha case were denied visas by the State Department on the grounds that they might overstay their visas and attempt to remain in the U.S. So, in December, Fox and his producing partner, Aline Kras, returned to Brazil to compile their testimonies on videotape for presentation at the press conference.

One of these witnesses, Liliane Silva, now a 46-year-old early childhood teacher, said that on Jan. 20, 1996, at about 3:20 p.m., she and her sister and a friend were taking a shortcut home when she noticed some graffiti on a wall. Underneath it, she stated, “I saw the creature.”

“It was short in stature, with red eyes, brown skin, as if covered in oil,” Liliane recounted.

“When I saw it, I had a terrible feeling as if the world had stopped.” She screamed to alert the others. “The creature looked at me,” she continued. “I looked into its eyes. It gave me a sensation that it was suffering, that it was asking for help, hiding from someone.”

Then, she and the other children ran.

Her sister, Valquira Silva, and their friend Katia Xavier provided similar details in their own video statements. It had “three fingers on its hand, a big foot,” Katia said, adding: “It seemed he was suffering, asking me for help.”

In her statement, the mother of the Silva sisters, Luiza Helena da Silva, said she went back with Katia about twenty or thirty minutes later to find the creature gone. But she said it left behind a footprint with three large toes and an acrid odor that remained in her nose for several weeks.

Sometime later, the mother said she was visited by four strange men dressed in black, offering a briefcase filled with cash if her daughters would go on television and lie by describing the creature as a calf, a sick dog, or a sick human. She refused, saying she was very frightened by the visit.

Yet another videotaped witness, unnamed and his face obscured, said he was in the army in 1996 and helped transport the being from the hospital in Varginha to Três Corações and from there to Campinas, where other soldiers took over. Upon returning to Três Corações, he said, “There was talk the Americans had the creature, having transported it to an undisclosed location.”

At the news conference, Dr. Italo was questioned about his contact with the nonhuman being in the Varginha hospital room. Was it bleeding? Agitated?

“It was initially OK, it just looked out the window,” Dr. Italo replied. He said that instantly, “I was not there as a doctor anymore. The being was looking straight at me. The more he looked at me, the more I had a feeling of peace; it was transmitting peace. It looked at everything happening as if it was taking notes, like a great observer of everything happening around it.”

Asked if he had had any subsequent contacts with nonhuman intelligence, the doctor replied simply, “No.”

Fox said the videos of the entities are held by people too afraid to release them, but that for the first time, he may have the help of Brazilian Senator Girão and Representative Burlison, who is currently working on strengthening whistleblower protection for UAP witnesses.

In Varginha, individuals continue to come forward. On Jan. 26, Rosangela Ramos appeared on camera with James Fox, saying that her late husband, Pedro Luiz Aguilar, the chief of police in Três Corações in 1996, who had been on duty during the incident, claimed he had also witnessed the creature, although she had no further details. Aguilar died in December.

At the news conference, Burlison called for international transparency.

“If there's any government that's holding information about the knowledge of whether or not we are alone or not alone in the universe, that is not for any government, no matter how powerful it is, to withhold from the rest of humanity,” Burlison said, to general applause.

Dr. Italo says he has no regrets about coming forward.

“The truth is, I saw the being,” he said. “He was not a being from our planet. We are talking about something that changes the concept of humanity.”

“It's important for people to know.”

By Leslie Kean and Ralph Blumenthal

OVER A LARGE BOX of untouched donuts in Washington's Longworth House Office Building, Congressional representatives sat rapt as a visiting Brazilian neurosurgeon described what it was like to stare back at the large lilac-colored eyes of a highly intelligent, nonhuman being.

So, not your usual Capitol Hill meeting.

The closed-door session on Jan. 15 brought together three members of Congress seeking greater government transparency on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, long called UFOs, and a group of Brazilians who say they witnessed the crash of an otherworldly spacecraft and later encountered its nonhuman occupants.

Coming thirty years after the striking events, the private Washington meeting (to which we alone had media access), followed by a public press conference five days later, raised the prospect of unprecedented Brazilian-American cooperation in unraveling the mysteries of one of the best researched—and shocking—UFO cases on record.

The witnesses included the highly respected neurosurgeon, a forensic pathologist, and a geography teacher. They were brought to the United States by filmmaker James Fox, who interviewed more than two dozen witnesses for a new feature documentary that expands on a 2022 version of his film Moment of Contact. Fox has been investigating the case, with his Brazilian counterpart Marco Aurelio Leal, for over two decades.

“This could settle the debate once and for all that we're not alone,” Fox told the packed news conference, which he organized at the National Press Club on Jan. 20.

The story is this: On January 13, 1996, in the countryside outside the municipality of Varginha, Brazil, the geography teacher—also an ultralight pilot—reported seeing a cylindrical craft trailing smoke and crashing to Earth. A week later, three girls walking home through a vacant lot reported encountering a cowering creature with reddish eyes and brown oily skin that reportedly communicated its suffering through its eyes. Before long, the streets of Varginha were filled with military trucks and emergency vehicles amid rumors of the capture of two nonhuman beings, one later hospitalized, and a clandestine American operation that spirited them out of Brazil.

Fox said that now, for the first time, he knows the names of those who were in possession of videos of the purported nonhuman entities. Despite the difficulties in obtaining them, he said, “I never give up.”

Susan Gough, a Pentagon spokesperson, did not reply to requests for comment.

The Department of Defense All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), with a mission to scientifically investigate UAP, stated in a 2024 report that “none of these investigations (including USG, foreign, and U.S. academic efforts) reached the conclusion that any of the UAP reports indicated extraterrestrial origin.”

But AARO may not have a free hand. As Fox recalled, in 2024, he met with AARO staff to discuss a video staff members had obtained. They discussed the Varginha case, among others. At one point, AARO director Dr. Jon T. Kosloski came into the room. Fox says he asked Kosloski if there was a plan to inform the public about “what we are ultimately dealing with.” Kosloski replied, “I can't part my hair without the approval of the DOD. And you can quote me on that.”

There is no question that the Varginha case lacks hard data. No one has yet been able to come up with photographs or videos, physical evidence, official documentation, or medical records that could help verify the episode. Yet over two dozen witnesses to many aspects of the case have come forward independently, providing pieces of a puzzle that seem to fit together to tell a compelling story.

The Congressional meeting, held in Tennessee Representative Tim Burchett's office, drew two fellow Republicans—Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, chairwoman of the House's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, and Eric Burlison of Missouri—along with staff members. Two Democrats with a longstanding interest in UAP issues—Jared Moskowitz of Florida, and Andre Carson of Indiana, a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence—were invited but unable to attend.

“Can you take it from the top?” Luna asked the visiting neurosurgeon, Dr. Italo Venturelli, 73, at the beginning of the meeting, “Who brought the being in? I want detail about what the interaction was, from point A to point B.”

Burchett also pressed a question: “Was the being able to communicate in any way? Was it telepathic or anything like that?”

Dr. Italo (as he prefers to be called), who was on duty that day in Regional Hospital in Varginha, said the captured being was initially treated by his colleague, Dr. Marcos Vinico Neves, who sutured a wound on its cranium. Neves died in 2018, and no medical records were kept of this procedure, according to Dr. Italo.

He says he was shown a brief black and white video of the patient and then spent three or four minutes at its bedside, having been asked to visually examine it after the procedure.

“I've been a doctor for forty-six years and have performed thousands of surgeries,” Dr. Italo said in an interview before the meeting. “To me, it was obvious that this was not a human being.”

“It looked like a seven-year-old child,” the neurosurgeon told the representatives with help from a translator in attendance. “Its eyes were lilac color. Both eyes and the cranium were teardrop-shaped. It transmitted calm and tranquility.”

The doctor said it seemed to him that his patient was at peace with everything that was happening, and that he sensed it possessed intelligence greater than his own. He also described feeling as if he were looking at an angel.

“I wouldn't say it communicated telepathically; it communicated empathetically,” he said, “through its eyes.”

“What did the hands look like?” Luna asked.

Dr. Italo demonstrated, holding up three fingers and a thumb.

He said he had fixated on the eyes, which seemed to communicate power, concentration, and compassion. At one point, the being looked at him, looked out the window at the blue sky, and then looked back at the doctor, as if to communicate its wish to be released.

Burlison, taking notes, asked if it was wearing clothing. Bare above the sheet, said Dr. Italo. The skin was white, the torso was slim, and there were no nipples. A small mouth. A sliver of ears.

Burlison asked if any other medical staff or doctors could corroborate the story.

Yes, said Dr. Italo, but most doctors are afraid to speak out because they have been threatened, or for fear of damage to their careers.

“It's very important to get the others,” Burlison said.

Dr. Italo said that a near-fatal heart attack and other recent medical issues persuaded him to break his silence last year and provide his full story to Fox for the first time, even though he still works full-time at Regional Hospital.

Carlos de Sousa, the geography teacher and ultralight pilot, told the representatives that he saw a “cigar-shaped” craft that he first thought was a blimp with a lateral tear trailing white smoke and struggling to stay aloft before crashing near a highway.

He said he drove over to help any survivors and was overtaken by a strong odor of ammonia and rotten eggs. Picking up a piece of what looked like aluminum, de Sousa said he was able to crumple it in his fist, but it then immediately sprang back to its original shape. Military trucks arrived within minutes. A soldier approached him and aimed a gun at his head, demanding, “Leave now, or I'll split your skull,” de Sousa said. Dropping the fragment, de Sousa fled, but said he was confronted shortly afterwards by two men in an unmarked dark vehicle who threatened his family and demanded his silence. He did not speak about the incident for decades.

A third Brazilian visitor, Dr. Armando Fortunato, who has been a forensic pathologist and criminal medical examiner for the Civil Police for over three decades, told the representatives that he had performed an autopsy on a young military police officer, Marco Chereze, who had grabbed one of the beings during its capture and then died a few weeks later from a severe infection after it inadvertently scratched him.

Dr. Armando, as he likes to be called, said a legal request has been filed to exhume Chereze's body with hopes of collecting bacteria—or even DNA samples—that could undergo further analysis.

Dr. Armando handed the representatives a signed statement from Dr. João Janini, 89, a specialist in pathological anatomy whose biography states he has performed over 50,000 autopsies. Janini attested that he had found a rare form of a bacterium “of extremely high aggressiveness and lethality” in the tissue samples from Chereze. The characteristics of the infection went so far beyond the limits of what is conventional that, in his opinion, “it raises the hypothesis of its alien origin.”

Accounts from former U.S. officials involving alleged UAP crash retrievals and related recoveries of nonhuman bodies have continued to surface, although the Defense Department dismisses them as unfounded.

In a 2023 Congressional hearing, David Grusch, a veteran of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, and the Defense Department's UAP Task Force, testified under oath that the U.S. has retrieved vehicles and “biologics” of exotic origin.

“Biologics came with some of these recoveries,” he asserted, referring to nonhuman bodies and tissue samples, citing “people with direct knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program.” Since then, other former officials with high security clearances have echoed his statements, sometimes under oath.

Kirk McConnell, who served for 37 years on the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the House Intelligence Committee until retiring in early 2024, opened the Jan. 20 press event. He was among the staff from the two Senate Committees who collaboratively investigated the UAP issue on behalf of senators from both parties.

McConnell told the audience that reports similar to those from the Varginha case reached senators and staff conducting these investigations. The interested senators, who included now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio, held meetings and interviews in sensitive compartmented intelligence facilities “with very credible sources reporting both direct and secondhand knowledge of the reality of highly intelligent nonhuman beings, government retrievals and reverse engineering of craft not made by human beings, and the recovery of bodies of non-human beings,” McConnell said. 

He had attended some of these classified meetings.

The reports provided to Congress included alleged hidden government activities similar to those recounted in the Varginha case, stretching across many decades. “So what these folks are going to tell you today are astounding, but they're not the only credible testimony about such events,” McConnell said.

In a video statement screened at the press conference, Jacques Vallée, a French-American computer scientist who has worked on projects at NASA and DARPA, and has been a leading thinker and writer on UFOs for over fifty years, cited a “data warehouse system” that he and a scientific team compiled for the Defense Intelligence Agency.

In addition to over 200,000 reports of anomalous objects in flight, Vallée said the database includes “hundreds of reports of creatures, live or dead, associated with crashed or landed vehicles of unknown provenance, including some similar to those in Varginha,” and that creatures in other documented cases breathed air normally.

Vallée said that the Varginha case is similar to many classified cases in scientific and medical records, but it also “presents exceptional new knowledge”, especially “in the professional description of the anatomical and behavioral features of the live creature recovered by authorities within a short time of the crash, and to the point of its death.”

During the private discussion in Burchett's office, Dr. Italo said he had learned that the being he saw was taken to ESA military base, then to Campinas, and then to the States.

“All the people we talked to said the exact same thing,” Fox told the representatives.

Luna said Congress should seek Air Force flight logs and a landing permit to confirm any American retrieval operation of bodies and crash debris from Varginha, although it is uncertain whether any paper trail exists.

Later, at the press conference, Col. Fred Claussen, a retired and highly decorated U.S. Air Force colonel who held a top-secret clearance, outlined ways the alleged secret U.S. mission might yet be documented. He said that a Brazilian air traffic controller, Marco Feres, reported that on or about Jan. 20, 1996, a U.S. Air Force cargo plane, most likely a C17, took off from an American base and landed at Viracopos airport in Campinas to pick up an unusual cargo before departing for an unknown location in the U.S.

Any such cargo plane mission, the colonel said, would require paperwork from Air Mobility Command at Scott AFB in Illinois and the Air Mobility Wing at Charleston AFB in South Carolina. Air refueling would require more documentation, as would an international flight plan to Brazil, even if the mission were classified, Claussen said, adding that at Campinas, there would need to be more refueling records and another international flight plan.

Even without a paper trail, he said he believed that thirty to forty Americans involved with the operation should have direct knowledge of this flight and its purpose.

“Here is my plea,” Claussen concluded. “If you were a participant and have knowledge of this mission, come forward.”

McConnell followed by saying there was general misunderstanding that nondisclosure agreements signed by intelligence figures barred them from sharing their information about UAP recoveries with Congress. They were not liable, he said, if they presented their accounts in properly secure facilities like SCIFs. In fact, he said, “It's illegal to withhold information from Congress.”

No one has ever been prosecuted for providing classified information to Congress, McConnell said. In fact, the President himself “could affirm disclosure to Congress with the stroke of a pen or [on] social media.”

While greater UAP disclosure has been widely regarded as a bipartisan issue in Congress, “we're not yet at the tipping point for most members of Congress,” McConnell said.

A joint evidence-seeking operation between Brazilians and Americans could be in the works. Brazilian Senator Eduardo Girão, who represents the coastal state of Ceará and led a Brazilian Senate hearing on UAP in 2022, came to Washington to meet with members of Congress and attend the press event.

“Are there videos that you think you might be able to get access to, any other material evidence?” Burlison asked Girão.

The two discussed the need for a joint effort to acquire tangible evidence that could help validate the incident.

In 2015, Ektaa Kapoor introduced supernatural fiction to audiences with Naagin. Starring Mouni Roy and Adaa Khan in the lead roles, the story of shape-shifting serpents became an overnight success. Over the last 11 years, the show has been loved across the country, and its latest season (Season 7) is currently airing on TV. Now, it seems like the filmmaker is set to take the franchise to the big screen.A source exclusively told India Today that Balaji Telefilms is in conversations to potentially expand the Naagin franchise beyond television. They mentioned that Ektaa is really excited to transform her TV show into a big-screen experience.“Given the brand's long-standing popularity and cinematic scale, the makers are exploring the possibility of adapting the franchise into a feature film, with the aim of reimagining the mythology for the big screen. The conversation is in the initial stage, but with the experience the team has had building seven successful seasons, it seems like the plan will turn into reality soon,” the source added.Even though the plan is still in its initial phase, there would be immense curiosity around who will get to play the titular role. Even on television, Ektaa is said to indulge in an extensive search for her ‘naagin' every season. Given it's one of her most prized projects, even the styling, costumes, and other details are personally looked into by her.Interestingly, producer Nikhil Dwivedi was also set to breathe new life into the iconic folklore of Naagin, with Shraddha Kapoor playing the lead character. The film initially created a buzz, but post Stree 2 in 2024, the filmmaker seemed excited to restart the project. However, there have been no updates on the film so far.And if a female Naagin wasn't enough, Karan Johar, along with Mahaveer Jain Films, is helming a fantasy comedy titled Naagzilla, featuring Kartik Aaryan in the role of Preyamvadeshwar Pyare Chand -- an icchadaari naag (shape-shifting snake). The film is reportedly set for release on Nag Panchami, August 14, 2026.- EndsPublished By: Pritinanda BeheraPublished On: Jan 30, 2026Also Read |  Ektaa Kapoor slams reuse of Pavitra Rishta title for new TV show: Terrible ethics

UAP supporting financial well-being, retirement readiness with enhanced toolkit

UAP Inc. is supporting employee financial well-being and retirement readiness with an enhanced retirement toolkit.

The toolkit contains a range of information for employees approaching retirement, from financial preparation — including information on the company's pension and budgeting tips — to the potential impact on mental health that can take place after exiting a full-time role, says Geneviève Hébert, the company's senior director of global compensation. She notes the psychological aspect of retirement is a particular focus for the company this year.

“It's a big change from working normally 40 hours a week to having a lot of free time [and] at first it appears to be kind of a vacation. . . . We give them tips to slowly integrate into their routine, such as taking up hobbies or volunteering. [We want employees] to think about how they want to spend their time.”

When UAP employees are approaching retirement, they receive a letter outlining all the steps that will take place with their pension and benefits prior to leaving their role, along with the toolkit.
Hébert notes the toolkit also provides advice on physical health, including managing sleep, stress and chronic conditions such as diabetes. It also provides tailored advice for men and women entering retirement as they may face different health challenges. “For women, their bone density lowers with age, so important to keep building muscles because the muscle mass will decrease quickly after retirement.”
The toolkit is just one part of UAP's financial wellness strategy, which also includes savings plans such as a group tax-free savings account and defined contribution pension plan and access to financial advisors. She notes following retirement, former employees can remain invested in these plans and still access advisors and other financial resources.

“We allow them to continue to be in the plans and the financial advisors continue to provide advice on how to manage their budget post-retirement.”

It sucks to have your favorite NFL team get bounced before the Super Bowl — but it's an unfortunate fact of life for 30 fanbases. (Editor's note: Go Bills.) But in the vacuum that inevitably follows defeat, certain sects of NFL fans love to gin up a conspiracy theory that proves, actually, their favorite team was wronged rather than fairly beaten. 

Such fans this week have latched onto a new version of the "script" meme — the idea that the NFL is rigged and, for some reason, doling out clues about its conspiracy — via an illustration that was posted by the league before the season began. If you zoom in on the image, you can see QBs Sam Darnold and Drake Maye at the very front of a group of players staring down the NFL's Lombardi Trophy, given to the winner of the Super Bowl. 

Darnold and Maye play for the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, respectively, which are — you guessed it — the teams who'll face off in Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8. The odds of correctly guessing the teams that would appear in the Super Bowl are 0.39 percent, so it is quite the coincidence that those two players just happened to be placed together.

The illustration has gone viral since the Super Bowl matchup was decided over the past weekend. To be clear, lots of folks are joking about the "script" — it has become a meme after all — while a smaller number appear to genuinely believe this is evidence that the league is fixed. 

So many people posted about the image that NFL VP of Communications Brian McCarthy responded, writing on X, "Re: the 'controversy' over this image - no."

Jokes and silly allegations of the NFL being rigged have been around for a while. The NFL itself has joked about fans claiming there's a "script," running an ad in 2023 where players do a table read of the next season. Despite the NFL itself making fun of the "script" theories, it's an idea that refuses to go away. Theorists, for instance, developed a whole hypothesis that the NFL was previewing the Super Bowl teams via the colors in each year's logo for the big game. 

In 2024, meanwhile, people were convinced the NFL was rigging results for the Kansas City Chiefs because, of all things, Taylor Swift was dating Travis Kelce. As I wrote at the time, the NFL is not capable of pulling that off and, even if it were, would never risk its billions of dollars in profits for something so trivial. (Editor's note: Again, go Bills.)

So, no, that image from September is not evidence that the NFL is rigged. Hell, if you look at the image closely, Tampa Bay's Baker Mayfield and New York's Malik Nabers both appear to be closer or just as close to the trophy. Neither of those teams even made the playoffs. 

Saquon Barkley of the Philadelphia Eagles — my favorite team — is the furthest away from the trophy, however, which is definitive proof that the NFL was rigging the season against Philly so they couldn't repeat as champions.

ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 30 (UPI) -- One of the longest-running searches for extraterrestrial life is coming to end this year as U.S. scientists wrap up a popular program that enlisted millions of home computer users to analyze radio signals received from space.

After years poring through immense amounts of generated data, the program's co-founders at the University of California at Berkeley told UPI this week they are probing 100 detected signals deemed to be the best candidates for messages from "ET" before the effort is wrapped up for good, 27 years after it was launched.
But even though the "SETI@home" project has so far failed to record a "first contact" from an alien civilization, its leaders say valuable lessons have been learned that can be applied to the continuing hunt for beyond Earth.
SETI@home, short for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, was launched in 1999 by scientists at UC Berkeley who over the course of two-plus decades enlisted more than 5 million "crowdsourced" volunteers willing to donate their home computers' processing capacity to analyze data generated by momentary energy blips picked up by the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.

It was one of the pioneering efforts at distributed computing in an era before supercomputers and high-speed Internet connections. Under the project, home users downloaded and installed free software that could pick out signals deemed to be "ET" candidates from raw data supplied by the 1,000-foot radio telescope at Arecibo, which collapsed in 2020
The observatory was damaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and rebuilt, but it met its end a little more than three years later because filled spelter sockets that anchored the massive support cables had been undergoing long-term chemical and mechanical degradation.
The data was collected over a period of 14 years and covered almost the entire sky visible to the telescope as its operators performed other tasks, such as mapping solar system bodies and discovering pulsars.
From its data, the home computer users ultimately produced 12 billion detections. The vast majority turned out to be radio frequency interference from man-made sources, such as satellites and earthbound radio and television broadcasts, but researchers for years continued to doggedly plow through the possibilities.
Billions of "candidate" radio signals narrowed to final 100
Project co-founder David Anderson of UC Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory said he and his team spent a decade narrowing down that massive list to 1 million candidates and then to a final 100, which are now being investigated using China's 500-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, also known as FAST, in hopes of finding them again.

And after that's completed, the long-running program will officially be a wrap, in part because it has now reached point of diminishing scientific returns.
"The output of the first two phases of SETI@home were millions of what we call signal candidates, which are basically collections of momentary bursts of energy from the same place in the sky at about the same frequency, but possibly spread over many years," Anderson told UPI.
"And of course, there was a lot of work involved in removing the man-made interference from from these things and ranking them, because at some point we had to go through them and manually inspect the signal candidates to get rid of the ones that are obviously interference.
"A lot of that we could do by using computer algorithms we developed, but in the end, we had to look at these signals ourselves."
To guide the development of those algorithms, Anderson and his team used artificial candidates, or "birdies," that modeled persistent ET signals within a range of power and bandwidth parameters. The birdies were introduced blindly, allowing the team to gauge how sensitive their detection system was.
The only reason they were able to generate the initial billions of candidate signals was due to the small processors provided the home-based volunteers, whose response at the start of effort in the late '90s was overwhelming, Anderson said.

"Whether there is extraterrestrial life is kind of the most important unanswered scientific question at this point, and so I think we knew that we'd get some users," he said. "We banked on, I think, 50,000 people initially, which we thought we'd need to keep up with the stream of data from Arecibo.
"We got a lot of national media coverage at right at the beginning, and within the first year we had close to 1 million participants. We actually had to scramble to figure out ways to use that surplus of computing power effectively."
UC Berkeley research astronomer Eric Korpela, another co-founder of the program, said he felt a keen "sense of accomplishment" with SETI@home, both in the sense of technical achievements -- such as in vastly increasing the sensitivity of signal detection over existing spectroscopic methods -- and in how it demonstrated the intensity of worldwide public interest in the search for ET.
"We encountered a lot of resistance from the SETI community when we first started started this," he told UPI. "Whenever you start a project with a large public-facing component, there's always the fear in a lot of peoples' minds that you are going to do something wrong and you're going to turn people off the entire field.

"But, of course, I think that wasn't the case. Instead, this really engaged the public imagination, and I don't think that we're necessarily done with that. Someone could again tap into that sense of fascination that people have about the search for extraterrestrial life."
Many people still want to have a connection to this sort of science, Korpela said, adding, "I think that is really a large part of our legacy."
Others praise, assess impact of SETI@home
Other researchers and organizations deeply involved in the search for extraterrestrial life also praised the accomplishments and legacy of SETI@home as it wraps up its mission.
One of them is the National Science Foundation National Radio Astronomy Observatory and Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, trailblazers in radio astronomy and operators of Breakthrough Listen, described as the largest ever scientific research program aimed at finding evidence of civilizations beyond Earth.
Observatory public information officer Jill Malusky noted that her organization and UC Berkeley's SETI Research Center worked together on SETI@home, and that its winding down won't sever that relationship.
"The NSF NRAO/GBO are big supporters of citizen science projects, and we're excited about the impact of SETI@home's legacy through the tireless work of its volunteers, and for the public recognition SETI can bring to efforts like these," she told UPI.

"The search for techno-signatures and extraterrestrial life is a very exciting part of the scientific research that the NSF NRAO's telescopes can do -- and it's one of the accessible areas for the public to understand."
Most staffers who work at the West Virginia observatories were drawn there "by the same curiosity we all have when we look up at the universe -- are we the only ones here? Is anyone else out there?" she said.
"While what we find with our telescopes may not be as dramatic as we hope, like a sci-fi movie, it's still exciting to have our work overlap with the search."
Similarly, prominent astrobiologist and SETI researcher Douglas Vakoch said SETI@home revolutionized the search for life in the universe by solving one of the greatest challenges of looking for intelligence in space, and that by doing so "directly inspired a new generation of researchers who are attempting first contact by sending powerful radio messages to the stars."
Vakoch is president of METI International, a nonprofit research and educational organization dedicated to messaging extraterrestrial intelligence, and editor of many academic works in several fields.
He told UPI that SETI@home was a breakthrough in that it was able to combine "mainstream astronomy" with the search for extraterrestrials, which researchers must "constantly struggle to justify" as they seek precious telescope time.

"With SETI@home, scientists did both," Vakoch said. "As astronomers pointed the Arecibo radio telescope at targets of their choice, SETI@home also analyzed the incoming data, but this time for signals that can't be created by nature. SETI@home was designed so scientists could conduct mainstream astronomy and simultaneously determine whether we're alone in the universe."
in that way, instead of becoming an obstacle to astronomers seeking time on the world's largest radio telescope, SETI@home "helped foster public support and recognition for space science."
Its greatest legacy, he said, is that it is now "guiding the next generation of interstellar communication," including Vakoch's own METI project, which rather than listening for radio signals from space as SETI does, reverses the process by sending powerful radio signals to nearby stars in the hope of eliciting a response from an advanced civilization.
Despite thus far coming away empty-handed in the search for ET, the SETI@home project nonetheless provided many valuable insights, Anderson said.
"It was a 'whole sky' project that covered the everything visible from Arecibo, and there's there's a lot of technical things that we did, some of which were right and others we would do differently if we had to go back," he said.

"So we learned a lot of lessons about how to do radio astronomy, and we published two papers last year describing them."
He added that the powerful distributed computing system established for SETI@home can be used in the future for research in related areas such as cosmology and pulsars, or even for medical research.

Project co-founder David Anderson of UC Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory said he and his team spent a decade narrowing down that massive list to 1 million candidates and then to a final 100, which are now being investigated using China's 500-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, also known as FAST, in hopes of finding them again.


And after that's completed, the long-running program will officially be a wrap, in part because it has now reached point of diminishing scientific returns.

"The output of the first two phases of SETI@home were millions of what we call signal candidates, which are basically collections of momentary bursts of energy from the same place in the sky at about the same frequency, but possibly spread over many years," Anderson told UPI.

"And of course, there was a lot of work involved in removing the man-made interference from from these things and ranking them, because at some point we had to go through them and manually inspect the signal candidates to get rid of the ones that are obviously interference.

"A lot of that we could do by using computer algorithms we developed, but in the end, we had to look at these signals ourselves."

To guide the development of those algorithms, Anderson and his team used artificial candidates, or "birdies," that modeled persistent ET signals within a range of power and bandwidth parameters. The birdies were introduced blindly, allowing the team to gauge how sensitive their detection system was.

The only reason they were able to generate the initial billions of candidate signals was due to the small processors provided the home-based volunteers, whose response at the start of effort in the late '90s was overwhelming, Anderson said.


"Whether there is extraterrestrial life is kind of the most important unanswered scientific question at this point, and so I think we knew that we'd get some users," he said. "We banked on, I think, 50,000 people initially, which we thought we'd need to keep up with the stream of data from Arecibo.

"We got a lot of national media coverage at right at the beginning, and within the first year we had close to 1 million participants. We actually had to scramble to figure out ways to use that surplus of computing power effectively."

UC Berkeley research astronomer Eric Korpela, another co-founder of the program, said he felt a keen "sense of accomplishment" with SETI@home, both in the sense of technical achievements -- such as in vastly increasing the sensitivity of signal detection over existing spectroscopic methods -- and in how it demonstrated the intensity of worldwide public interest in the search for ET.

"We encountered a lot of resistance from the SETI community when we first started started this," he told UPI. "Whenever you start a project with a large public-facing component, there's always the fear in a lot of peoples' minds that you are going to do something wrong and you're going to turn people off the entire field.


"But, of course, I think that wasn't the case. Instead, this really engaged the public imagination, and I don't think that we're necessarily done with that. Someone could again tap into that sense of fascination that people have about the search for extraterrestrial life."

Many people still want to have a connection to this sort of science, Korpela said, adding, "I think that is really a large part of our legacy."

Others praise, assess impact of SETI@home

Other researchers and organizations deeply involved in the search for extraterrestrial life also praised the accomplishments and legacy of SETI@home as it wraps up its mission.

One of them is the National Science Foundation National Radio Astronomy Observatory and Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, trailblazers in radio astronomy and operators of Breakthrough Listen, described as the largest ever scientific research program aimed at finding evidence of civilizations beyond Earth.

Observatory public information officer Jill Malusky noted that her organization and UC Berkeley's SETI Research Center worked together on SETI@home, and that its winding down won't sever that relationship.

"The NSF NRAO/GBO are big supporters of citizen science projects, and we're excited about the impact of SETI@home's legacy through the tireless work of its volunteers, and for the public recognition SETI can bring to efforts like these," she told UPI.


"The search for techno-signatures and extraterrestrial life is a very exciting part of the scientific research that the NSF NRAO's telescopes can do -- and it's one of the accessible areas for the public to understand."

Most staffers who work at the West Virginia observatories were drawn there "by the same curiosity we all have when we look up at the universe -- are we the only ones here? Is anyone else out there?" she said.

"While what we find with our telescopes may not be as dramatic as we hope, like a sci-fi movie, it's still exciting to have our work overlap with the search."

Similarly, prominent astrobiologist and SETI researcher Douglas Vakoch said SETI@home revolutionized the search for life in the universe by solving one of the greatest challenges of looking for intelligence in space, and that by doing so "directly inspired a new generation of researchers who are attempting first contact by sending powerful radio messages to the stars."

Vakoch is president of METI International, a nonprofit research and educational organization dedicated to messaging extraterrestrial intelligence, and editor of many academic works in several fields.

He told UPI that SETI@home was a breakthrough in that it was able to combine "mainstream astronomy" with the search for extraterrestrials, which researchers must "constantly struggle to justify" as they seek precious telescope time.


"With SETI@home, scientists did both," Vakoch said. "As astronomers pointed the Arecibo radio telescope at targets of their choice, SETI@home also analyzed the incoming data, but this time for signals that can't be created by nature. SETI@home was designed so scientists could conduct mainstream astronomy and simultaneously determine whether we're alone in the universe."

in that way, instead of becoming an obstacle to astronomers seeking time on the world's largest radio telescope, SETI@home "helped foster public support and recognition for space science."

Its greatest legacy, he said, is that it is now "guiding the next generation of interstellar communication," including Vakoch's own METI project, which rather than listening for radio signals from space as SETI does, reverses the process by sending powerful radio signals to nearby stars in the hope of eliciting a response from an advanced civilization.

Despite thus far coming away empty-handed in the search for ET, the SETI@home project nonetheless provided many valuable insights, Anderson said.

"It was a 'whole sky' project that covered the everything visible from Arecibo, and there's there's a lot of technical things that we did, some of which were right and others we would do differently if we had to go back," he said.


"So we learned a lot of lessons about how to do radio astronomy, and we published two papers last year describing them."

He added that the powerful distributed computing system established for SETI@home can be used in the future for research in related areas such as cosmology and pulsars, or even for medical research.
