                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cool-down room: Russell, Verstappen and Antonelli give their take on Norris/Piastri clash It was a tough day for Alpine at the Canadian Grand Prix, with Franco Colapinto slipping backwards from P10 while Pierre Gasly remained out of contention for points. Franco Colapinto was left to rue a “wrong” strategy after slipping backwards and out of the points at the Canadian Grand Prix, while Alpine team mate Pierre Gasly also conceded that the team “need to review” following a tough afternoon in Montreal. Things had initially looked promising for Colapinto, who lined up in P10 on the grid after outqualifying Gasly for the first time since making his F1 comeback. However, after losing a position early on to Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, the Argentine later lost out further when he found himself in traffic following his first pit stop. It proved to be a difficult race from then onwards for Colapinto and he ultimately crossed the line in 13th, having been unable to work his way back up into the top 10. “It was tricky to know [if] we were doing the wrong thing, but I think we definitely were doing the wrong stuff. “I had really slow pace after that pit stop with the dirty air and [it was] very tricky to overtake, just power [limited] on the straights and it just made our race very tricky. “It was tough out there today, I think still [there were] some things learned and some things to take, but we need to focus on the next one.” “It's just that when you start in the points you want to stay there, and it feels like we didn't do the right things today to try and stay [there], and that's the only thing.” It was also a challenging day at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve for Gasly. Gasly's tricky afternoon also saw him forced wide onto the grass by Lance Stroll during a battle for P17, an incident that resulted in the Aston Martin driver receiving a 10-second time penalty. I feel like he could have done a slightly better job to give me a bit more room – not talking about much, I know we're both at the limit and we're talking a few centimetres.</p>
