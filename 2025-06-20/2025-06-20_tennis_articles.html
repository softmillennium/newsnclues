                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Briton into world's top four after win over Nakashima There were, after all, quite a few self-sabotaging concentration lapses, his forehand was too erratic and he did not always seem comfortable moving on the slick grass. The victory means Draper will return to his career-high ranking of No 4 on Monday, securing him a top-four seeding at Wimbledon. At a time when almost every player wishes to avoid an early meeting with Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner, he cannot face either of the world's top two before the semi-finals. However, a meeting with Alcaraz here remains on the cards. One day after his own dramatic three-set win, as he recovered from 2-4 in the final set to defeat Jaume Munar in a three hour, 26-minute marathon, Alcaraz, the top seed, returned to the semi-finals at Queen's Club with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Arthur Rinderknech. Alcaraz has won 16 consecutive matches, the longest winning streak of his career. Alcaraz stressed how difficult it was to recover with less than 24 hours after such a tough match. For Draper the past few days have, in some ways, emphasised just how much things have changed over the past year. Although he has broken new ground this week by reaching a first semi-final at this venue, he still feels some way from producing his best. “The level of what I'm playing could be more consistent, definitely better,” he said. I don't know when it will come together, but still doing well to be in the semis. While he has previously been able to produce his best level from the beginning of the grass season, Draper is still finding his feet after enduring his first full clay-court season and the significant efforts it took for him to adapt his game to suit a completely different surface. This is still [early] because I didn't practise too much before the tournament with certain things. I'm sort of going by ear out there a little bit, and I'm trying to become more and more comfortable on the grass. When you get more comfortable in the movement, more comfortable in what you're trying to do out there, it just starts clicking.” During the decisive moments, though, the confidence that Draper has gained over the past few years has been plain for all to see and every match affords him the opportunity to further improve his level on grass as he attempts to peak in time for Wimbledon. Elsewhere, the world No 1, Jannik Sinner, released his first music single, Polvere e Gloria (Dust and Glory), with the famous Italian vocalist Andrea Bocelli. Alongside Bocelli's singing, Sinner reiterates parts of his past speeches during trophy ceremonies. In Nottingham Katie Boulter's bid for a hat-trick of titles came to an end as she was beaten 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 by McCartney Kessler.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the grass-court season in full flow, players are ramping up their Wimbledon preparations. Just days after Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner in a French Open classic, tennis switched over to the grass ahead of the year's third Grand Slam tournament. Two players have stood out above the rest and could cause havoc at Wimbledon next month, entering the tournament without a seed next to their names. Having the month of his life, Alexander Bublik backed up his run to the Roland Garros quarterfinals with another shock win in Halle. Becoming the first player other than Alcaraz to beat Sinner since August 2024, Bublik proved just how dangerous he can be on grass courts. He may yet be seeded, though, as a title for Bublik in Halle would see him rise to world number 30. Bublik will continue his search for a second Halle title in three years when he plays Tomas Machac in the quarterfinals on Friday, June 20. Dropping the first set to Alcaraz 4-6, few would've predicted Munar to launch a comeback, but he did just that, winning a marathon one-hour, 40-minute second set, 7-6 [9-7]. Despite leading his fellow Spaniard by a break in the decider, Munar was unable to hold on to the advantage, losing out in three sets, 4-6, 7-6, 5-7. Bublik and Munar have impressed on the grass this week, but how have they performed at the All England Club throughout their tennis careers? Winning 58% of his matches at SW19, Wimbledon is statistically Bublik's best Grand Slam tournament. Munar, on the other hand, is still looking for a breakthrough at Wimbledon, having failed to win multiple matches at the event on his five previous visits. In the Spaniard's defence, he has lost to some strong grass-court players over recent years, falling to Cameron Norrie, Lorenzo Musetti, and Alex de Minaur. The 2025 Wimbledon tournament is scheduled to begin on Monday, June 30.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some things in life come more naturally, and for Jiri Lehecka, grass-court tennis appears to be one of them. After missing last year's grass swing due to a back injury, the Czech star may have approached this season's return to the surface with uncertainty. But rather than hesitating, Lehecka has silenced any doubts and surged to a significant milestone: his 100th tour-level victory. “I always like to play on grass, I call it a real surface,” Lehecka told ATPTour.com at the HSBC Championships in London, where he is into the semi-finals. “I didn't know what to expect from myself at the beginning of last week. It was my first match on grass in two years… Adjusting to grass for me is not that hard because it fits my style. There has been a quiet confidence around Lehecka's return to grass this year. Armed with blistering groundstrokes off both wings and an explosive first serve, Lehecka's game translates seamlessly to grass. He first made waves on the surface with a memorable run to the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2023 before he was forced to retire against Daniil Medvedev. Yet even before that, Lehecka's affinity for SW19 was clear: He captured the boys' doubles title there with countryman Jonas Forejtek in 2019. “Wimbledon is a special place for me,” Lehecka said. “It was the first time I had success on grass. “It was my first time being at a champions' dinner as a junior winner… I enjoyed my time so much back then and of course, two years ago I was playing pretty well on grass. Despite being sidelined last year, Lehecka has returned to grass in 2025 with vengeance. He has already matched his win tally of five matches on the surface from his breakout 2023 campaign, establishing himself as a serious threat once more. Prior to Wimbledon, Lehecka has unfinished business at Queen's Club, where he is into his third ATP Tour semi-final of the season. “It will be a big battle as always,” said Lehecka, who trails Draper 1-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “Jack is a great competitor, he's having the best season of his life so far. The two-time ATP Tour champion, Lehecka reached a career-high No. He stunned top seed Carlos Alcaraz that week before falling to Draper, but this week Lehecka is the only semi-finalist to have not dropped a set en route. “There is no better place to play my first semi-final on grass than here at Queen's,” said Lehecka.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Draper is into the semi-finals of Queen's for the first time after another gritty performance ousted the USA's Brandon Nakashima in three sets. The win also means that he will return to No 4 in the world after this tournament, overtaking Novak Djokovic and Taylor Fritz. It is a useful step up, because a top-four seeding at Wimbledon means that he won't have to face either Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner until the semi-finals. Draper had to scrap extremely hard for this 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 victory, which depended largely on his remarkable ability to repel break points. He faced 11 of them in the match, and was broken only once. There were moments when the home fans began to show their perplexity at Draper's fondness for the drop shot, which never seemed to work against an extremely fleet-footed opponent. But he brought his other virtues to the party, notably a first serve that grew in influence over the course of the match. By the time he reached the deciding set, he was landing it two-thirds of the time, and his eventual tally of 14 aces played a significant part in the match. The victory earns him a meeting with Jiri Lehecka, after the Czech defeated the other surviving Briton – Draper's junior contemporary Jacob Fearnley – in straight sets. Katie Boulter's hopes of defending her Nottingham title ended at the quarter-final stage, delivering a blow to her chances at Wimbledon. In a tournament and on a court that she described as feeling like “home”, Boulter was unable to take control of the match and convert the points that mattered in a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 defeat by McCartney ­Kessler. Boulter started the tournament, which she had won in successive years, ranked 39th in the world, with the top 32 given protected seedings at Wimbledon, thus avoiding coming up against a top-ranked player until the third round. But ­following this setback she will drop to 41. “If I was chasing points and chasing rankings, then I'd be playing next week, but my plan is not to because I want to prioritise Wimbledon and that's something I've not done before, so I'd quite like to try something different,” a defiant Boulter said after the match. Where Boulter was subdued in her match against Sonay Kartal on Thursday, she was much more vocal on court against American Kessler. The pair were evenly matched in a contest stretching 2hr 7min on a hot day in Nottingham, but Boulter was left to rue what could have been after breaking twice in the decider. Both times she was unable to avoid being broken back herself. At 4-3 ahead in the third, and needing only two more service games to go her way to win the match and reach the semi-finals for a third successive year, Boulter faltered. She lost her next two service games as Kessler carved out three match points on the Briton's serve, taking the second. Despite the outcome in the Midlands, Boulter believes she is in a good place 10 days out from Wimbledon. Draper is talking to the BBC. The support I have received this week has been amazing. I've been getting used to having the crowd against me lately so this is really nice. To be in the semi-final for the first time is something I've wanted to do ever since I was a little kid, so it means everything to me.” On tough three-set battles and winning due to having the confidence of recent victories: “It definitely helps to have you guys behind me, also at times I've not played great tennis and in those times I've just tried to believe in myself and I think that's where the confidence comes from, from the start of the year, and that's carried me through really, and hefully I can carry it on into th next round and keep playing a bit better On returning to No 4 in the world rankings and therefore being among the top four seeds at Wimbledon. Does that give  added belief? “Not really, to be honest. I keep on getting asked by the journalists about top-four seedings, but I had to get to the semis first... but obviously to be in that position it's an incredible feeling. I was ranked 40 at Wimbledon last year and to go there ranked fourth is a testament to all the hard work me and my team have done – so very proud of that... Should [Henman] Hill be renamed and if so what should we call it? But that's sand, isn't it? Nah, let's keep it Henman Hill for now. We didn't change it for Andy and he would have been next in line for that so maybe one day I'll have something but I don't think there's something that goes with Draper yet. Good return from Nakashima who forces Draper off court with a forehand and then hits into the open court for 0-15. A slow serve by Draper, who goes long inexplicably. Another drop-shot by Draper backfires as Nakashima reads it and then smashes Draper's attempted lob. Draper hits the line with an audacious forehand. Nakashima goes long and Draper gives vent to a primal scream! Nakashima forces Draper to the net, and almost passes the Briton but Draper anticipates and volleys away the winner! Two excellent serves from the American who is serving to stay in the match. Nakashima is coming out swinging but he swings too hard there and goes long. Lovely forehand from Nakashima across court for 401-5 and a decent serve gives him the game. Draper wins a long rally for 15-0 and then batters a serve down the T-line. Nakashima makes two unforced errors and Draper takes a comfortable game. Lovely passing shot by the American to follow up his serve. Good return from Draper and Nakashima goes long. Draper shouts two quick-fire “Come ons!” Could this be the crucial game? The British No 1 returns well again and this time the American goes long. Draper keeps the ball in play and Nakashima hits it out of play. Draper and the crowd think he has hit a winner for the vital break of serve but his shot was a fraction wide. Two amazingly deep ground-strokes by Draper are followed up by a wicked forehand winner from Draper. He is rewarded for his sudden change of tack – going aggressive. A real burst of intensity there from Draper after getting to 15-15 with a big forehand cross. He brought up two break points with backhands into the Nakashima forehand corner and thought he had landed a third to take the break, but HawkEye said “No”. Never mind, the forehand line gives him a great opportunity to see this one out. The backhand cross is an underrated weapon for Draper who hits it quite flat and often rushes his opponent with the lower bounce. Strong serving from Draper takes him 30-0 up. A weak backhand into the net from the baseline from Nakashima and it's 40-0. A glorious cross-court forehand pass by Nakashima brings up 30-0. Draper goes long and the American is edging this tight contest you feel. Draper has got his groove back on his serve and takes the game comfortably to 15. A big serve for 15-0 and then a long rally which Nakashima wins after Draper goes wide with his forehand. Nakashima this time tries an ambitious winner down the line and misses. Lovely forehand return down the line by Draper. Big first serve by Draper earns him 15-0 but he nets a volley for 15-all. Nakashima can't return the next two serves. A weak first serve leads to a long rally but the American nets much to Draper's relief. Nakashima makes two good serves to go 30-love up but Draper benefits from an unforced error and then takes the ball early to force another mistake from Nakashima, who nets. Impressive play from the world No 32. If he can only serve as well as he has in the previous two games. A long exchange concludes with Draper going long by a country mile. Nakashima has the better of Draper in this rally and comes to the net to intercept the Briton's attempted pass. Draper goes long and all of a sudden Nakashima has two set points. Draper goes long from the baseline! Oh Jack... didn't serve well there at all. Well, it was a shock to see that break point finally claimed by Nakashima on the ninth attempt, but the law of averages won out in the end. Draper returns well for 15-all but is then aced. Draper tries to take the second serve early but mistimes it and sends it wide. The Briton goes long on his service return. Draper tries to serve volley but nets. Big serve and follow-up forehand from Draper across court. Wicked body serve from Draper and then an angled slider. The way things are going, you'd be shocked if we weren't playing a tie-break in five minutes' time because there's not been much sign of a break so far. Nakashima fires a brave second serve past Draper for 15-0. Draper tries to pulverise his opponent's second serve on the next point and misses the line by a millimetre. Draper goes after another second serve and Nakashima can't get it back. The American is struggling with his first serve but is faring curiously well with his second serves. Draper gets taken to 30-all but serves the two clutch points remarkably well to end Nakashima's hopes of breaking serve for the first time. Good serving by Nakashima doesn't give Draper a look-in for the first three points. An unforced error by Nakashima is redundant as the American wins to 15. Two very quick games there. He goes wide to hand Nakashima 30-15 but two more monster serves and it's an easy hold. Nakashima fires down a Big Bertha for 15-0 but Draper demolishes the next one for 15-all. Nakashima hits a passing shot that just kisses the line for 30-15. Another good serve brings up two game points and then he serve volleys for a solid hold. Another break point flashed past for Nakashima in Draper's last service game, so that's all seven saved now. It's not as if Nakashima has been snatching at his opportunities; it's just that Draper is finding his best tennis when he needs it, especially with that sliding serve out to the backhand in the advantage court. If there's one big advantage to being left-handed, it's that most break points come on that side. Nakashima returns long but in the next point Draper comes to the net only to volley into it for 15-all. Fantastic deep return from Nakashima forces an error from Draper who goes just long. A long rally concludes wit Draper again hitting a forehand out of the target zone and it's break-point. Another wide serve ties Nakashima up. Draper covers a lot of ground on that point, scurrying left and right before rushing to the net. Nakashima tries to pass with cross-court backhand but can only net. Draper blasts a second serve past Nakashima for the game. Nakashima does exceedingly well to reach Draper's sliced return and Draper, on the run, nets when it looked like he might have enough juice to unleash a passing shot. A good return by Draper bring up 15-all, but Nakashima serves his way into a 30-15 lead. Draper hits a fantastic return but then goes a fraction long with his pass 40-15. An unforced error from Nakashima gives Draper hope but after returning well in the next point he goes long on the forehand to hand the American the game. A more comfortable service game from Draper who serves well and moves 40-0 up with a textbook piece of serve and volley. Nakashima gets a point back but Draper serves out without seating too much, despite the humid conditions. Nakashima wins the game despite looking a little ragged at the start of it. The American went 40-15 up after an exhausting rally in which Draper returned three almost unreturnable shots – and all for nothing. The American is testing his stamina here. Draper is serving for the first set. He loses the first point going a fraction too long with his forehand. Another drop shot is well-executed but Nakashima reads it and passes Draper cross court. Draper crashes a forehand long and it's 0-40. Draper goes for the drop shot yet again. What is this, the French Open? Draper comes bravely to the net and plays a delightful volley to save another break-point. Nakashima nets his return and it's deuce. Draper delivers another good serve and now it's set point. Oh, that's a wonderful shot by Nakashima, down the line and beyond the server. But he returns wide in the next point handing Draper a second set-point. Draper tries an ambitious passing shot down the line with his forehand but it was a strange decision that backfires and he goes wide. Nakashima returns long again for another Draper set-point. A tight first set there, with the key statistic being Draper's 100 per cent record when facing break points. The only thing he might be disappointed with is a low tally of just two aces, as against six from his opponent. Nakashima is reading the Draper serve remarkably well, and the backhand return winner he hit up the line in the last game was a collector's item: I can't remember the last time anyone did that to Draper's slider. Incidentally, did anyone else think that graphic of the ball at deuce in Nakashima's last service game showed it out, but called it in? Or was it my ageing eyes? A good serve and it's 30-love. Draper returns well again and stays patient at the baseline this time. The tactic pays off a Nakashima goes too deep with his backhand. Great defence by Draper, who returned a vicious kicking serve. Nakashima has an open-court volley but nets it! Fantastic cross-court backhand from Draper finds the corner and brings up set point. Nakashima unleashes a massive second serve into Draper's body. Draper batters the second serve this time, which was slower than the last. A good serve restores deuce. What a passing shot that is from Draper. Nakashima plays a lovely deep volley from the net and Draper looks beaten all ends up. Somehow, though, he fashions a top-spin pass that curves out of court an then back in again at the last second. Mr Whippy 🍦Draper serving up a cold whipped forehand on a hot summer's day ☀️#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/37HI8MJkE2 Nakashima plays two commanding service points to earn Advantage. He is coming more the net now, putting Draper under pressure to come up with miracle shots. Draper nets a regulation forehand and the American holds on to stay alive. A good serve is returned by Nakashima but he can't get back Draper's follow-up drive. Two powerful serves, the latter an arcing effort that sends Nakashima wide, gives the Briton 40-15. Four good serves including a ferocious ace at the end earn Nakashima a quick and easy love game – in stark contrast to the last. The fans are absorbed in this match, which isn't always the case at Queen's – an often snoozy and Pimm's-soaked venue. They groaned at every miss from Draper in his tight last service game, and sounded bewildered when he played two drop shots from game point up, losing both rallies. There is a secondary benefit to the tactic, though, as it prevents Nakashima from dropping deep in defence. A good return from Nakashima is reached by Draper but he can't quite lift his attempted pass over the net. A poor forehand by Draper hands the world No 32 cheap point. Lovely tennis by Draper saves the first of them; he sends the American left and right and then brings him to the net with another drop shot before firing into the open court. Two good serves and another pair of “Come ons!” and it's Advantage to the British No 1 Draper performs another drop shot which Nakashima does really well to reach. Draper just misses with his attempted cross-court forehand pass. A bad choice of drop shot that time and Nakashima ties Draper up with a big forehand into his body. This time Draper races to the net after two nice approach shot and salvages deuce. But Draper hits Nakashima's return into the tramlines for deuce. A big serve by Draper brings up Advantage. And another one gives him a hard-earned game. Draper digs himself out of a hole despite some suspect shot selections. Draper tries to punish Nakashima's slower second serve but hits well wide. Draper foils his opponent with whipped forehand that drops on the line at the last second. Fantastic return by Draper which even gets the applause of Nakashima. Draper is in the zone now and hits a vicious passing shot down the line for two break points. Nakashima saves them both with a big serve and an unforced error from Draper. The American catches Draper on his heels with a deep cross-court forehand, and Nakashima serves out well to survive the scare. Draper loses the first point but redeems himself with a nasty body serve. Nakashima sends three backhands long from the baseline in successive points to give Draper the game to 15. Nakashima begins with a double-fault and then is unable to return a ferocious Draper forehand. Two monster serves bring the game back to parity, but the American commits another double-fault for break point. Nakashima saves it after a long rally in which Draper returned brilliantly and then stayed in the rally, only to get over eager and hit a forehand into the tramlines. Another fine serve gives Advantage to the American, but Draper puts the pressure on with some pulverising forehands forcing his opponent to net. Nakashima takes the initiative with a big serve but it's deuce again after Draper executes a sneaky drop-shot that Nakashima reaches but can only net. Outstanding rally as Draper earns himself another break-point. Nakashima saves himself with another serve – measured at 131kph. Another entertaining rally concluded by Draper with a lovely drop shot from the baseline, which he follows up with a neat volley. And Nakashima gets it all wrong, mishitting a regulation forehand to hand Draper the first break of serve. Draper is looking smooth and confident here in the early stages. I saw him on the balcony yesterday and he said he was feeling better, after dealing with a heavy cold early in the week. Getting through the Popyrin second-round match on Wednesday was a decent effort in the circumstances. Nakashima, on paper, is the sort of match you want, because he gives you rhythm and he doesn't have Popyrin's point-ending power. But he is a very crafty player nevertheless, and his serve is deceptively strong. A nice start by Draper who fires down an unreturnable serve and then coaxes Nakashima into hitting long on the next point. A big serve brings up 40 love and he fires a delightful forehand winner down the line for a solid hold. Nakishima gets the match under way and begins convincingly, serving a couple of rocket serves that Draper cannot return. When he does get the ball back in play a long rally ensues with both players hitting hard and deep and Nakashima hitting the tramlines. He serves another missile for 40-15 and then delivers an impressive second serve to take the game with ease. Draper came though a really tight match against Alexei Popyrin in the last round, coming from a set down to win 3-6, 6-2, 7-6, changing his racket in the middle of the final-set tie-break. Today's opponent Brandon Nakashima is a big-serving American who looks at home on grass. The world No 32 already has one British scalp to his name, having beaten Dan Evans in two closely contested sets in the previous round. Nakashima is the latest in a growing list of impressive American tennis players. coming in the wake of Tommy Paul, who won this event last year, and Taylor Fritz, the world No 4. The 23-yeaar-old is not to be underestimated. Draper is hoping to succeed where Jacob Fearnley failed in the match before his on the Andy Murray Arena, the Briton losing in straight sets to Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic 7-5, 6-2. Victory is particularly important for the British No 1 as the defeat of Taylor Fritz yesterday means Draper could earn himself the world number four ranking and consequently a top-four seeding at Wimbledon, which would mean him avoiding the likes of Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Alexander Zverev in the early rounds at the All England Club later this month. But don't let's get ahead of ourselves.</p>

It's a significant step for Draper, meaning he'd avoid potential matches with Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner until the semi-finals of his home major later this month. He will overtake 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic and American Taylor Fritz in the world rankings, climbing from sixth to fourth. At Queen's on Friday he defeated the Brandon Nakashima in three tight sets, 6-4 5-7 6-4. "I've got to get to the semis first," he smiled, before adding: "I think it's a definite huge step for me. "I remember last year going in ranked around 30 or 40. To be inside the top four one year around, that's massive progress, a testament to my team, the dedication I have had for tennis, the work I have put in on a daily basis. At Wimbledon, regardless of seeding, each match is very difficult, because obviously you've got loads of top players in the draw, a bit like this week. "But it gives me confidence knowing I'm in that position and I'm going to be in the right place for that." Nakashima opened the match with a strong service game but soon Draper had him under pressure. He took an early break in the first set and consolidated it with a hold in the next game. He blasted down an ace to take the first set. Tim Henman (1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006) Andy Murray (2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016) Greg Rusedski (1997) James Ward (2011) Cameron Norrie (2021) Jack Draper (2025) Draper seized a break in the seventh game and built on that to take a clear lead in the final set. But pin-point forehand on to the line from Draper defended the first of them and he bellowed with satisfaction as Nakashima struck a return of serve too long to take them to deuce. "It means the world to me, the support I've received this week has been amazing," added Draper after becoming Britain's first semi-finalist since Cameron Norrie in 2021. Top seed Alcaraz eased through to the other semi-final after beating Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech 7-5 6-4. I am glad today was one hour and 20 minutes." Lehecka got revenge for that defeat by preventing Fearnley from becoming the first British man to reach the semi-finals on his Queen's Club debut in 48 years. Lehecka struck again for 3-2 in the second after a Fearnley forehand landed a millimetre out and then ran away with the match, wrapping up victory in an hour and 17 minutes. "Obviously if I'd known I was going to be put on first the day after playing a long match in 32 degrees and playing another doubles match late at night, then I probably wouldn't have played doubles," he said. "It's just difficult to predict those things sometimes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two Blue Devil standouts will compete together on American tennis' biggest stage. Rising junior Cooper Williams and graduate Theo Winegar — Duke's top doubles pairing for the latter part of the season — emerged victorious in the 2025 American Collegiate Wild Card Playoff. The tournament is a novel opportunity for collegiate tennis players to qualify for the U.S. Open, one of four professional tennis Grand Slams, or major tournaments. “I'm extremely proud of Cooper and Theo," said Duke men's tennis head coach Ramsey Smith. "They had a tremendous spring season, finishing No. For them to win both matches in straight-sets and earn a berth into the U.S. Open is such an incredible opportunity for them. It's amazing for the program and I couldn't be happier for the two of them.” In the final match Thursday afternoon against more conference opponents, Nicholas Godsick and Hudson Rivera of Stanford, Williams and Winegar took both sets 6-4, 6-4. Duke's team had also defeated Godsick and Rivera in April's ACC Championship semifinals. In total, they only lost two of 15 matches together, finishing undefeated in the spring with five straight wins. Winegar, a doubles specialist, transferred from Columbia for his graduate season and played at the No. Williams was the former ITA National Rookie of the Year at Harvard and demonstrated his elite talent as the year went on, holding his own on the top two singles courts and winning seven consecutive matches in March and April. The U.S. Open will begin Aug. 24 in its annual location of Queens, New York. Ranjan Jindal is a Trinity senior and audience engagement director of The Chronicle's 121st volume.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2 and two-time Wimbledon champion, Petra Kvitová, announced that she will retire from professional tennis after the upcoming US Open in August. Kvitová's decision to hang up the racket comes little over 5 months after her return to the courts, following a year-long hiatus and birth of her first child – son Petr. At the end of June, Kvitová is set to compete at Wimbledon, where she first burst onto the tennis scene, becoming the first player born in the 1990s to win a major title in 2011. “I am excited and very much looking forward to soak in the beauty of playing The Championships, Wimbledon one more time, a place that holds the most cherished memories in my career for me,” she writes on Instagram. In her message Kvitová also thanks for the “unwavering support” she received throughout her decorated professional journey, starting in 2006, and says she is prepared for the next step: “As with all phases in life, there comes a day that it is time for a new chapter, and that time for me has come now. While no such decision is ever easy to make, for me this is a happy moment! I will leave the sport with the biggest smile on my face – the same smile you've seen from me on and off court throughout my whole career.” Adding to her WTA accolades, Kvitová took bronze at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. As part of the Czech team at the Billie Jean King Cup (formerly known as Fed Cup), she collected 6 titles between 2011 and 2018 – most of any player since the 1980s.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The newly revamped mixed doubles competition is scheduled on Aug. 19 and Aug. 20, 2025, during US Open Fan Week at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. This year, the event will feature a fresh format, and the United States Tennis Association (USTA) already announced several pairings, including the duo of Sabalenka and Dimitrov. After receiving a first-round bye, she began her campaign in the second round, defeating qualifier Rebeka Masarova 6-2, 7-6(6). During the post-match press conference following her victory over Masarova, Sabalenka revealed that it was Dimitrov who initially reached out to her, asking her to partner with him for the mixed doubles at the upcoming US Open. Although at first she dismissed the idea, she ultimately agreed after Dimitrov “begged” her to join him. “He was just like texting me non-stop. He was begging me to play, and I was like, ‘Man, I don't want to play.' Sabalenka admitted that she was unaware of the new mixed doubles format, as no one had previously approached her about it. “He messaged me, and I didn't really know about the mixed doubles situation at the US Open. I was like, ‘What are you talking about? Dimitrov's best performance at the US Open came in 2019 when he reached the semifinals in singles. During that run, he triumphed over Andreas Seppi, Borna Ćorić, Kamil Majchrzak, Alex de Minaur, and Roger Federer to reach the semifinals. There, he lost to eventual runner-up Daniil Medvedev. Sabalenka's best result in the US Open doubles came in 2019 when she clinched the title alongside her partner, Elise Mertens. In their semifinal match, they registered a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over American duo Caroline Dolehide and Vania King, securing their place in the final. In the championship match, Sabalenka and Mertens faced off against the eighth-seeded pair of Ashleigh Barty and Victoria Azarenka and defeated them 7-5, 7-5 to win the 2019 US Open women's doubles title, both earning their first Grand Slam doubles title.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner, who had won the tournament in 2024, thus failed to defend his title and will lose 500 ranking points as a result. Carlos Alcaraz, Sinner's rival and the current world No. Thus, there is a gap of almost 1500 points between the two. Alcaraz had lost in the round of 16 at Queen's Club last year, which means that he had 50 ranking points to defend in the tournament this year. The 22-year-old Spaniard has already reached the quarterfinals this time, which means that he is assured of gaining 50 (100-50) ranking points even if he loses in his quarterfinal match. It will take his tally to 8900 ranking points. Should he win his next match and reach the semifinals, and then lose, he will stand to gain 150 (200-50) ranking points. It will take him to 9000, still almost 1300 points short of Sinner. Reaching the final and losing in it will earn the Spaniard 330 points, and he will thereby gain 280 (330-50) ranking points. Lastly, if Alcaraz goes on to win the tournament and earn all 500 points, his tally will be (8850+500-50) 9300 points, which will be around 1000 short of Sinner's tally. Carlos Alcaraz has won Wimbledon in each of the last two years and hence, will have 2000 points to defend this year. Jannik Sinner lost in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon last year, which means that he will have 400 ranking points to defend. That is a significant difference, and hence, Sinner will have very little to lose. Subhadeep, an adept tennis journalist at Sportskeeda, has been writing about the sport for seven years. He watches matches regularly and engages in social media platforms to stay on top of the latest happenings. As a writer, he brings the fan's perspective to his pieces, ensuring his readers enjoy an exceptional experience every time. Growing up, he idolized Boris Becker, but he now firmly believes Novak Djokovic stands alone as the 'Greatest of all Time', especially considering the 24-time Grand Slam champion's incredible stats. One thing that still puzzles Subhadeep, however, is how Becker's Wimbledon tally might have reached five if not for Pete Sampras. Speaking of the All England Club, the British Major holds a special place in his heart as he admires its blend of tradition and grass-court excellence. When not working for Sportskeeda, Subhadeep delves into the other "love of his life": football, and enjoys contributing his insights to different websites dedicated to the sport.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is Jannik Sinner still suffering from a Roland Garros hangover? 1's title defense at the Terra Wortman Open came to a screeching halt in Round of 16 on Thursday in a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 defeat to Alexander Bublik.The world No. But after relaxing with family and friends in his hometown of Sexten, Sinner proclaimed ahead of the tournament that he was ready to "forget the negative" and attack his first grass-court tournament of the season with a clear head. "I think playing in a tournament again is positive for me because every game starts at 0-0 and you always have to be mentally prepared to fight for every point on the court," he said, and went on to defeat German Yannick Hanfmann 7-5, 6-3 in his first match.Although Sinner routed Bublik in the quarterfinals in Paris, but it was a different story on German grass, a fact Bublik himself acknowledged afterwards speaking to Tennis Channel DE. Fifteen days ago, Sinner was a 6-1, 7-5, 6-0 winner over Bublik, his fourth win in four completed matches against the Kazakh. But from a set ahead in Halle, Sinner was confounded by the mercurial 28-year-old—who also has a track record of success at the German grass-court stop.

This backhand return from Bublik is BANANAS 😱#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/SloqZG0VHU He came into the match with 12 career Top 10 wins, but was 0-3 against world No. 1s.But that wasn't the most impressive streak snapped by Bublik's victory. In addition to having won six straight matches in Halle, Sinner had also won 66 consecutive matches against players ranked outside the Top 20 dating back nearly two full years. His last such loss was to Serbian Dusan Lajovic in Cincinnati in 2023, when he was ranked No. 45, and is the first man of any ranking not named Carlos Alcaraz to beat Sinner since last August. "I felt that only two or three points went Sascha's way today, and that was what made the difference in the end. "I'm relatively satisfied despite everything, two matches before Wimbledon. I need to regenerate mentally and physically now, it takes a little time, and then, logically, I'll analyze it. I think everything will be fine at Wimbledon. To be honest, it was more physical here. Mentally, I was relatively good in the first round, but you can't expect every day to be the same, so you have to accept that and yes, it's fine."

"The tournament continues, to be honest," Bublik said. I played Jannik less than two weeks ago and it was a different Jannik, I will tell you. "Sinner wasn't the only big name to lose in Halle on Thursday. 4 seed Andrey Rublev was a 6-3, 6-7(4), 7-6(6) loser to Tomas Martin Etcheverry of Argentina, failing to convert two match points. 2 seed Alexander Zverev, though, escaped defeat by rallying from a set behind to beat Italian Lorenzo Sonego, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(2).
