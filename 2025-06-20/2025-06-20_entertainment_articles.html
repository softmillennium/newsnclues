                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's no question that Broadway‘s Hamilton was (and still is) one of the most engrossing musicals on the Great White Way, but according to an original cast member, Madonna herself had other things to focus on. Rachel Zegler Serenades Crowd Outside Theater for Free in a New London Production of 'Evita' She was like this the whole time,” Ramos said, while pretending to look at a screen in his lap. Billboard has reached out to Madonna's representatives for comment. After rumors circulated in 2015 of Madonna's behavior after star and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda tweeted about not allowing a celebrity backstage after they used their phone during the performance, actor Jonathan Groff confirmed in an interview it was Madge. The news comes as Madonna prepares to release her long-rumored EDM remix album Veronica Electronica, set to feature exclusive reimaginings of tracks off her acclaimed 1988 album Ray of Light.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We've confirmed that Owen Wilson is returning for Meet the Parents 4 opposite Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Teri Polo and new castmember Ariana Grande. Fair to say that Stiller's Greg, who is looking to get the approval of Pam's rigid father, Jack Byrnes, (De Niro), is a bit jealous of Kevin. While the plot is underwraps, THR says that one plot point centers around the song of Greg and Pam, “who gets engaged to a ball-busting woman who seems all wrong for him.” Grande is the fiancée. 'Stick' Release Guide: When Do New Episodes Come Out? John Hamburg, who co-wrote all three prior films, wrote the screenplay and is set to helm. He also directed the last two episodes of Wilson's latest Apple TV series Stick. Jane Rosenthal and De Niro are producing through Tribeca Productions. Jay Roach will produce through Delirious Media. Stiller and John Lesher are producing through Red Hour Films. Universal EVP of Production Development Matt Reilly and Director of Production Development Jacqueline Garell are overseeing the project for the studio. Its sequels Meet the Fockers and Little Fockers were also box office successes, culminating in a total franchise gross of over $1.13 billion in the global box office. It was recently announced that Paramount would co-produce and release Meet the Parents 4 overseas. Universal Pictures will release the film wide on Wednesday, November 25, 2026.

Kevin Williamson was ready to put down his pen. “I was in a deal at Warner Bros. where you have to sing for your supper a little bit, in terms of making a pilot every season. So I realized I didn't have a pilot to show,” Williamson told IndieWire during a recent interview. Related Stories ‘KPop Demon Hunters' Finds Music That Slays (Monsters) Watch the ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' Writers Discuss How They Have Become Experts at ‘Pivoting' The copious amounts of alone time had forced Williamson to start contemplating how he would finally tell his most personal story to date: a drama series, set in his native North Carolina, loosely inspired by his commercial fisherman father's issues with the law. In 1983, during Williamson's transition from high school to college, his father, Wade, was arrested for using his own boat to participate in an elaborate drug smuggling operation, and he was later convicted of conspiracy to traffic marijuana in excess of 20,000 pounds — the same crime that Joey Potter's dad was arrested for in “Dawson's Creek.” In retrospect, Williamson insists that his father did what he felt he needed to support his family, because the fishing business in North Carolina at that time was about to go “belly up.” “I always teased my dad that I was going to do a show about him, and at first he would joke and say, ‘Well, just wait until I'm dead.' And then I finally said, ‘No, really, Dad.' He goes, ‘Well, I don't want to be dead and not see it,'” Williamson said, adding that Wade, a “Yellowstone” superfan, always wanted Kevin Costner to play him. He was a very funny man, and I think he would've had a big smile on his face because he would've loved all the things we did.” Set in the fictional town of Havenport, North Carolina, the series stars “Mindhunter” star Holt McCallany as patriarch Harlan Buckley who, while recovering from two heart attacks, decides to retake control of his family's crumbling fishing empire after his wife Belle (Maria Bello) and son Cane (Jake Weary) resort to increasingly dangerous means to keep themselves afloat. Smuggling opium at the whim of a mercurial drug kingpin (Topher Grace). Given that he had just been contemplating retirement a few years ago, Williamson, who just turned 60 last year, admits that telling such a personal story has given him a second wind. “I'm not going to sit down yet — one day soon, but not today,” he said with a playful smile. I can't keep writing teenagers my whole career, so it was nice to sit down and write some adults.” Speaking at the end of another long day of editing the next “Scream” sequel, Williamson opens up about the real-life elements which informed his long-awaited return to TV, how that explosive finale sets up a potential sophomore outing, the keys to building an epic love triangle — and why he thinks there will always be room for a good vampire story. The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. IndieWire: “The Waterfront” is not entirely about Harlan, but he is certainly the centrifugal force of this series. What parts of your own late father did you try to incorporate into the character that we see in this show? Kevin Williamson: I really wanted to incorporate his sense of humor. My dad had a big sense of humor, and he had that sort of self-awareness where he could comment on any given situation that he was actually standing in. I found that to be part of something that Holt does as Harlan — he does a running commentary on what's happening. With Harlan, Holt really captures the spirit of my dad, but I think Holt drew on his own father and his own background to figure out who Harlan was. You have always been known to create characters who are really an extension of how you see yourself. How did that manifest this time around? Are there any elements of yourself that you can recognize in the Buckley clan? Cane is that lost individual who feels like he's second-guessing every choice he's ever made in his life, and I can spiral that way for sure, and I'm sure a lot of people can. I think [Melissa Benoist's] Bree speaks to the outsider. Belle was a lot of my mom. My dad was a very simple but very complicated man, and he didn't show his feelings. You have described “The Waterfront” as good people who are forced to do very bad things. How would you describe the Buckley family's moral compass? One of the things that happens from a character standpoint is Harlan reignites [as a person]. Crime agrees with him, and he starts to get back his mojo and his swagger, and that part of him he had been missing. I think Belle says it in the first or second episode: She knows he can see it all ending, and this is a way for him to come back to life a little bit. And, of course, Cane is the one who has to morally figure out: How far is he willing to go? He's never really held a gun, much less pulled the trigger. We watch him go through all of those things, and his moral compass also comes in the form of his high school sweetheart who shows up. She's sort of the road not taken, and she's there to represent every choice he didn't take — and every choice maybe he still could. The finale ends with Belle seemingly taking the reins of the fishing empire right from under Harlan's nose — and Harlan appears to be none-the-wiser right now. How does that cliffhanger set up a potential second season? I think Belle, until this point, has stood by her husband. And I think it was around the seventh episode when she really lays it out on [Harlan] and she's like, “I earned my name. I am a Buckley more so than you are.” I think right around there, she's starting to figure out that, “You know what? I can't stand in the shadows anymore. I've sat by, and he just makes a mess, and I'm always there to clean it up. Now I need to get in front of him so he just won't make the mess to start with.” So I think her point at the end is she's just going to take control the same way Cane got into trouble, and she's just going to just push him aside and stand tall and deal with it. But I think she's going to take control. And then, of course, we have the Parkers [another crime family] who they're now beholden to, and I think there's a whole family there of interesting people. We had one, [played by] Topher Grace, this year. I think we're going to have a few more next year. Given that you put all of them in danger this season, did you ever consider killing any of them off? I really love the dynamic between Bree and Cane and how she sees him as the golden boy, and he doesn't feel like a golden boy at all. He sees his sister's trouble, and now they have this third sibling that has entered the mix who's kind of perfect. He actually walks in the door — smart, intelligent, with it all together — and the only thing wrong with him is he's living with some grief and he's looking for a place to belong. It's like, how far will he go to have a family? I think that's going to be Shawn's [Rafael L. Silva] burden next season, which is, exactly how far will he go? This show is a little bit about the sins of our father, and I wanted to put Bree on the right path so that she could perhaps have a whole different point of view next season. So I just wanted to get to the root of her drama, which was what she witnessed [as a child, with the killing of her paternal grandfather] and how [her family] just ignored her alcoholism. I also wanted to see Cane and his wife, [Danielle Campbell's] Peyton. So she's married this guy, she had a child with him, and I think now it's time to see them fall in love. They're doing it in the reverse way. This show is almost certainly going to draw comparisons to recent shows which have hit the cultural zeitgeist — “Ozark,” “Narcos,” maybe a little bit of “Succession.” Be that as it may, people will still try to fit this series into a specific box or genre. As a creator and writer, even though the inspiration for this show is extremely personal, how cognizant are you about creating something that may have widespread appeal and that may tap into the cultural zeitgeist in the same way? I don't think of it maybe the way that you just expressed it — which was great, by the way. I think of what's not on television right now. What's the show that I want to see? And more importantly, what's a show that I can write that no one else can? I wrote it from a place of family. I know how it went belly up. But I felt like this is a world that no one else was doing, so I chose to do it. It's still full of so much, so I just want to bring that to the screen. It's completely different than when I first started, and I didn't know how to make television back then. “Dawson's,” once again, was a very personal story, and no one else was telling that story, so I wanted to tell it. And the same with “Scream” as a movie. No one was making horror movies at that moment. I've seen all the horror movies now. What can you bring to this world?” There's so many ways everyone can be watching [content]. Part of me just loves it, and part of me is like, “Oh man, I wish we could go back.” But you can watch this hour-long drama and go, “Oh, this is a family drama. I've seen a family drama, but it's not quite like this [other show].” But hopefully, there's something comfortable about it; there's some comfort food there for people to tap into, and they'll just sit back and enjoy the eight episodes and binge them and just have a fun time. We live in a really weird place right now. We're in a weird time in the world, and I just want people to sit back and enjoy something for eight hours. I feel like they were the same goals 20 years ago when TV was in a different world. They're the same ones now — and it's not “Succession.” [Laughs.] This is a story about the Buckleys, and I love “Succession,” but I wouldn't make that comparison. We also just passed the 15-year anniversary of “Vampire Diaries.” It's so funny to me in retrospect that you and Julie Plec didn't think there would be a demand for more vampire content after “Twilight,” but here we are all these years later, and the genre seems to be en vogue more than ever. You never know what's going to resonate. I think there's always room for a great vampire story. “Interview with the Vampire” — that book came out in 1976, and now we're seeing it as a TV show. You're asking someone who just lives in the world of genre, so I'm always going to be up for a good vampire story. Why do you think vampires have stood the test of time? I just think this idea that there's this person that could kiss you or bite you — I mean, there's this inherent allure to vampires in their ability to seduce and do everything, and they're very dangerous. So if you tap into a great story with them, it's always fun. It was me dealing with someone who had died and I was in grief over someone, and I sat down and wrote a story about a dead vampire and a girl who was dead inside, and they brought each other back to life. Out of curiosity, have you seen Ryan Coogler's “Sinners”? [Williamson penned the screenplay for Robert Rodriguez's 1998 sci-fi horror film, and Coogler cited the film as one of his inspirations.] You are no stranger to creating iconic love triangles — both on “Dawson's Creek” with Dawson-Joey-Pacey and “Vampire Diaries” with Damon-Elena-Stefan. What do you think are the keys to creating an epic love triangle? Well, they all three have to be winning; they all three have to be heroes. You can't have a villain in the bunch. If you have a villain, then you're going to know exactly who to root for. I think it was so easy to portray Damon as the bad one, and you wanted Elena to pick Stefan. But I think we quickly divulged something very, very personal about Damon that made us realize that maybe there is something in him that can love and maybe love will save it. So we just set it up where everyone has a love for the triangle, but also a want that if they don't get who they want, if they don't get their soulmate, if they don't get the person they love, then it will completely affect the rest of their life. In “Vampire Diaries,” it was so awesome because everything was epic and the stakes were so high all the time, and we were just turned up to a 10 all the time. That was another show where we wanted to be shocking, so we'd kill someone in the middle of something. You are in the middle of doing post-production for “Scream 7,” which will center on Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), and this is your first time in the director's chair since 1999's “Teaching Mrs. Tingle.” Is it true that Neve was responsible for convincing you to direct this sequel? It was a Zoom, so she got to see me cry. I think somehow there were all the conversations that were had without me, and then they Zoomed me and asked me, and it was awesome. What have you made of the experience of returning to “Scream,” and how are you looking to breathe new life into the franchise? [Williamson agreed to direct amid a period of upheaval following the departures of stars Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega.] Look, we had a blast doing it. I was always there on the sidelines [as an executive producer] throughout it all, and the reason I stepped away was mainly Wes [Craven], because I was like, “Our time has passed. The same way Wes created a family, I think this group of people have created a family, and it's been quite wonderful to be a part of it. I can't really talk about it without giving stuff away, but I did go down a road that has never been gone down before, I think… [Pauses.] It's “Scream 7.” I did everything I could to make it feel new and fresh, so we'll see what happens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While filming Hallmark's latest installment of its popular “Hannah Swensen Mysteries” franchise, Victor Webster realized he had so much fun learning to tango with co-star Alison Sweeney, he's up for a little more dancing — potentially even on live TV. The dynamic duo, who play Detective Chad Norton and baker-turned-sleuther Hannah Swensen, had to take dance lessons for a scene that appears in “Pie to Die For: A Hannah Swensen Mystery,” premiering June 22 on Hallmark Channel. In addition to rehearsing the actual dance steps for their upcoming movie, Webster and Sweeney also had to hold poses as their director — and fellow Hallmark star — Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe captured gorgeous overhead angles and a dramatic scene-ending dip. Webster told EntertainmentNow they “had a great time doing the scene,” but he acknowledged that freezing in place as he and Sweeney looked into each others' eyes during that dip wasn't the easiest thing to film. “You know, I talked with Ali about it the other day,” he said, “and she was like, ‘One of the hardest things was, you know, to look super relaxed and comfortable while you're, like, laying backwards and being held up and like, you can't put any stress in your neck.' “Nobody holds that pose,” he said, adding, “Well, maybe somebody on ‘Dancing with the Stars' does.” When EntertainmentNow asked if he'd consider competing on DWTS, Webster said, “You know why I would do it? I'm not a reality TV guy, and that's more of a competition show, but my goddaughter wants me to be on that show so badly.” Like, I can't just snap my fingers, sweetheart, and then be on ‘Dancing with the Stars!' But if somebody asked me to do it? These days, Webster's open to all kinds of experiences that expand his horizons and zest for life — whether learning to dance, connecting with fans at events like the upcoming Hallmark Christmas Experience and fan cruise with Kristoffer Polaha, or diving into favorite hobbies, including photography and travel. Webster told EntertainmentNow that the latest thing he's tried is stand-up comedy. “There might be crickets in the audience, but whatever. So there's a lot of stuff around that I think dog owners will really appreciate.”</p>

German filmmaker Uli Edel adapted a harrowing nonfiction book by Kai Hermann and Horst Rieck with testimonies from users who haunted the drug-cruising spot at Berlin's Zoo Station, including from Christiane Felscherinow, who was 13 when she fell into the wrong crowd and started shooting up amid the underground club scene. For the film version, Edel cast then-unknown actress Natja Brunckhorst (who would later write her own memoir about her experience making “Christiane F.”) as the David Bowie-worshipping teen addict experimenting with first love and drug use. Related Stories ‘KPop Demon Hunters' Finds Music That Slays (Monsters) Danny Boyle Says He Couldn't Make ‘Slumdog Millionaire' Today, and He'd Want ‘a Young Indian Filmmaker' Instead Edel takes a decidedly non-moralistic approach to capturing the actual drug-addled youth who populated Berlin in the '70s; at one point, Christiane (Brunckhorst) stumbles in a bleary daze through a tunnel lined with strung-out punks, needles hanging out of their arms and their eyes glazed over. Justus Pankau and Jürgen Jürges' cinematography likely hasn't looked this shockingly vivid since the film's 1981 release, when Roger Ebert called it “one of the most horrifying movies I have ever seen.” Edel captures the jet-black streets at night and the bunker-like postwar subterranean of Berlin in a way that feels oddly romantic and nostalgia-worthy — especially under the gleaming neon signage of the trendy discotheque Sound — without ever romanticizing a youth-culture-killing drug epidemic. “Christiane F.” also stands out for its soundtrack, supplied by David Bowie with songs from the albums “Heroes” (including the title track, playing almost triumphantly as Christiane joins a marauding band of street kids wreaking havoc in a mall), “Station to Station,” “Lodger,” and “Low.” There's even an excerpted David Bowie concert, originally shot in New York, juxtaposed with audience shots from an AC/DC concert in West Germany. Bowie's inclusion makes for a cutting contrast between the doomy glamor of Berlin's late-'70s club scene with the darkness thrumming beneath it. Edel, working from Herman Weigel's screenplay, neither shies away from the brutality of Christiane's plunge into underage sex work nor the cold-turkey withdrawal hell she experiences with her boyfriend (Thomas Haustein), where they end up scrambling desperately for another fix. Once clean and with help from her mother to get sober, Christiane thinks she can handle one more shot in the arm, but that proves impossible as she's thrown into more tragic circumstances. “Christiane F.” functions on its own terms as a piece of provocative pure cinema, but it's also in a social dialogue with the rise of cautionary tales like the controversial American “memoir” “Go Ask Alice” from 1971, which charts a 15-year-old girl's self-destruction and was later deemed fiction. The book was used as an educational tool to warn kids off drug use, a tradition of agenda-driven anti-drug art that began with the American exploitation movie “Reefer Madness” in the 1930s, and of course continued with myriad after-school specials. “Christiane F.” inadvertently might have served the same purpose, but Edel isn't chasing moral instruction here. He's capturing a moment, a milieu, and it's one that the real-life Christiane eventually pulled herself out of, unlike many of her friends.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Don't you just love it when two worlds collide? That's exactly what happened when Henry Winkler lent a helping hand to Marlee Matlin during a critical time in her life. Matlin and Winkler's connection began early in her career when she was just 12-years-old. Winkler first saw her perform on stage at a variety show in Chicago. At the time, Matlin's mother urged Winkler to discourage her daughter from pursuing acting, worried about the challenges a deaf actress would face. Winkler recalled telling her mother, “You got the wrong guy.” “Who would have thought he'd take the time to give attention to a little deaf girl like me, especially when he didn't even know American Sign Language?” “I think anyone who has a mentor like that would understand how important he was to me.” This includes her troubled relationship with the late actor William Hurt. Hurt, who passed away in 2022 at age 71, was described by Matlin as a “habit of abuse.” Despite the difficulties, Hurt encouraged Matlin to seek help for substance abuse, leading her to check into the Betty Ford Center. There, she received treatment for marijuana and cocaine addiction. “I walked out of that house and never went back,” she said. During this challenging time, Matlin leaned heavily on Winkler. Speaking through an interpreter with Fox News Digital, she described how Winkler and his wife, Stacey Weitzman, opened their home. “He didn't make it hard for me to reach out. But to have that close relationship with him and his wife… I was very fortunate. “She said, ‘I just broke up with my boyfriend. Can I stay with you just for the weekend?' Then I asked Stacey, and she said, ‘Of course. To everyone's surprise, including Winkler's, Matlin stayed much longer than a weekend. “Two years later, she finally moved out!” Winkler chuckled. Their relationship continued to deepen through the year. She married her husband, Kevin Grandalsi, in Winkler's backyard. I could always depend on him, knowing he genuinely believed in me. Despite not knowing much about deaf culture, Winkler never treated Matlin differently. “He didn't ignore the fact that I'm deaf, but he treated me with love and respect, just like anyone should. “Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore” premieres on June 20th, offering an intimate look at the actress's journey and the powerful friendship that helped her survive and thrive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two months after Fat Joe sued his former hypeman Terrance “T.A.” Dixon for extortion over “false and vile accusations,” the one-time employee has filed his own lawsuit accusing the rapper of having sex with two underage girls. Most seriously, Dixon claims that he “personally witnessed defendant engage in sexual relations with children who were fifteen and sixteen years old.” “In exchange for cash, clothing, and payment of her cell phone bill, defendant would get oral sex and other sexual acts performed on him by Minor Doe 1.” Those explosive allegations come two months after Fat Joe sued Dixon and his attorney, Tyrone Blackburn, over claims that they were extorting him by making “wholly fabricated, grotesque, and scandalous allegations,” including “unspeakable acts such as pedophilia.” “The allegations against Mr. Cartagena are complete fabrications — lies intended to damage his reputation and force a settlement through public pressure. We have taken legal action to expose this fraudulent campaign and hold everyone involved accountable.” Asked by Billboard about Tacopina's statement regarding law enforcement, Blackburn repeatedly referred to his opposing counsel by the name Joe Taco Bell: “We offered Joe Taco Bell an opportunity for his client and me to meet at the [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York] to file our respective criminal complaints and he tucked his tail between his legs and never responded. In his Thursday complaint, Dixon says he dedicated his “talent, labor, and loyalty” to Fat Joe for 16 years, serving not just as a hype man but also a “lyricist, background vocalist, security team member, and creative collaborator.” But he says the star manipulated and abused him in myriad ways, ranging from underpayment to threatening his life. That's a very different story from the one that Fat Joe himself told first in April, when he sued Dixon and Blackburn for defamation over “a predatory plot, built entirely on lies, to destroy Cartagena's reputation and business for profit.” In that case, the star says he “compensated Dixon handsomely” and the hype man “never complained or expressed any dissatisfaction.” But he says the ex-staffer recently started airing false grievances about his pay and other issues, and has published “shocking falsehoods” to social media while making “outrageous financial demands.” The early lawsuit also names Dixon's lawyers as a defendant, claiming Blackburn threatened to file baseless legal action. “Dixon's and Blackburn's conduct is … a cold-blooded attempt to extort exorbitant sums from Cartagena by leveraging the specter of public disgrace and professional ruin,” Tacopina wrote in April. It is also replete with photos of the alleged teenage victims, and claims that Dixon faced “credible threats” to his life, including “attempts to lure him into a violent ambush.” Those sprawling claims allege that Fat Joe and his associates operated an illicit enterprise, and also names a number of outside groups as defendants, including Jay-Z's Roc Nation. Blackburn included similar civil RICO claims in a sexual assault case he filed last year against Sean “Diddy” Combs on behalf of producer Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fat Joe‘s former hype man has accused the rapper of “coercive labor exploitation, financial fraud, sexual manipulation, violent intimidation, and psychological coercion” in a lengthy lawsuit filed Thursday, Variety reports. The former employee, Terrance “T.A.” Dixon, is also reportedly alleging that the rapper, real name Joseph Antonio Cartagena, built his empire while deliberately suppressing, silencing, and erasing Dixon's “substantial” creative and commercial contributions. Dixon suggests that Cartagena forced him into “humiliating situations, including sex acts performed under duress and surveillance, accompanied by threats of abandonment in foreign countries if [he] refused compliance.” Over time, he estimates that he was “coerced into more than 4,000 sexual acts to maintain his standing within the Enterprise.” The suit also alleges that Dixon “personally witnessed [Fat Joe] engage in sexual relations with children who were fifteen and sixteen years old,” including a 16-year-old girl who “in exchange for cash, clothing, and payment of her cell phone bill … would [perform] oral sex and other sexual acts,” a 15-year-old girl who “due to Minor Doe 2's body being adolescent and not fully formed, Defendant paid for her to get a Brazilian Butt Lift,” and a third 15-year-old, who Cartagena was allegedly “in love with.” Dixon also claims that he was forced to engage in sex acts including in “repeated orgies involving Plaintiff, female dancers and minors,” which he alleges were filmed or watched by Cartagena, corporate security staff, and other members of Cartagena's entourage. “[Dixon] did not willingly consent to participate in these acts; instead, Plaintiff submitted solely out of fear of immediate retaliation, which Defendant repeatedly demonstrated would include financial punishment, professional sabotage, abandonment in foreign countries, or physical harm,” the suit continues. Tacopina previously helped Cartagena sue Dixon in April over posts on social media claiming that the rapper had flown a minor across state lines for sex. “The lawsuit filed by Tyrone Blackburn and Terrance Dixon is a blatant act of retaliation—a desperate attempt to deflect attention from the civil suit we filed first, which exposed their coordinated scheme to extort Mr. Cartagena through lies, threats, and manufactured allegations,” Tacopina said of the new suit in a statement. The allegations against Mr. Cartagena are complete fabrications—lies intended to damage his reputation and force a settlement through public pressure. We have taken legal action to expose this fraudulent campaign and hold everyone involved accountable.” JEZEBELIt Took 25 Years, But Carrie Is Finally Burdened By the Weight of Family Fat Joe's hype man alleges rapper coerced him into "4,000 sexual acts," including with minors Taylor Swift text messages ruled fair game in Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni case</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mariah Carey's newest Hot 100 entry has Lambs reflecting on elite chart history. Please include your first and last name, as well as your city, state and country, if outside the United States. “Mariah Carey's latest hit is a great achievement, considering she is a legacy artist on the Billboard Hot 100. “On a side note, Mariah has Hot 100 No. 1s in eras dominated by physical releases (1990s), digital distribution (2000s) and streaming (‘10s, ‘20s).” Lambs are smiling this week, as Carey claims her 50th Hot 100 hit, “Type Dangerous.” The feat had Carey fans, and chart fans, noting the impressive percentage of her career entries that have gone to No. With 50 making for easy math (phew), her 19 No. 1s translate to a 38% success rate in ruling the chart, while her 28 top 10s make for 56% of her charted titles hitting the top 10. How do those numbers compare to others over the Hot 100's nearly 67-year history? Twenty-five acts have notched eight or more Hot 100 No. Among them, here's a ranking of the artists with the highest rate of chart entries having hit No. George Michael reigns with the best percentage of Hot 100 hits reaching No. In baseball terms, that's a Ted Williams-esque .420 batting average. Notably, Michael's total covers only his solo Hot 100 hits, including Wham! 's “Careless Whisper,” on which he's also listed as a solo featured artist. If rolling up the duo's history — three No. 1s among nine entries — into his as a soloist, Michael would still rank first with a 39% rate of topping the Hot 100, just above Carey's 38%. Unlike in prior eras, so-called album bombs have swelled certain acts' totals of charted hits — and in a week that Swift holds the top 14 titles, only one can be No. How about artists' rates of hitting the Hot 100's top 10? Again, in looking at the 25 artists with eight or more Hot 100 No. Artist, Percentage of Hot 100 Entries Hitting the Top 10: George Michael again takes top honors, with a lofty 79% of the late singer-songwriter's Hot 100 hits having reached the top 10. 30, 1993; and “Killer”/“Papa Was a Rollin' Stone,” No. 1s, Michael would still rank first on the list above if factoring in Wham!, whose nine Hot 100 hits have resulted in seven top 10s — an almost identical high rate, 78%, to his 79% solo. It took some time for the totals to nearly align: Following its 1984 release, Wham! (Michael is also two-for-two on songs named “Freedom.”) Meanwhile, it takes three decimal points for Swift (22.348%) to place just above Drake (22.346%) when it comes to their titles reaching the top 10. One other act comes to mind regarding this research. 1 — “Baby Don't Forget My Number,” “Girl I'm Gonna Miss You” and “Blame It on the Rain” all led, “Girl You Know It's True” hit No. 2 and final charted single “All or Nothing” peaked at No. Milli Vanilli, thus, owns a unique slice of Hot 100 history, even if it's somewhat owed to the abrupt end of its chart run. Perhaps the mark adds further shine to the pair, which in recent years has been looked upon much more kindly than when it was always a lock for the chart's upper reaches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An archival recording of the original Blues Brothers — John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd — performing live, The Lost Recordings, will arrive this October. The release coincides with a new graphic novel, The Blues Brothers: The Escape of Joliet Jake, written by Aykroyd's daughter Stella, Luke Pisano (son of Belushi's widow, Judy Belushi Pisano), and filmmaker and writer James Werner. The album, pressed on “royal blue” vinyl, is only available as part of a package with the graphic novel. Judy Belushi Pisano recently rediscovered the live album, which features 13 previously unreleased recordings. The musicians backing up “Joliet” Jake E. Blues and Elwood J. Blues (Belushi and Aykroyd, respectively) are the original band members, a who's who of notable soul men and bluesmen: members of Booker T. and the M.G. 's, the Bar-Kays, Howlin' Wolf's band, and the Saturday Night Live band at the time, including Steve Cropper, Donald “Duck” Dunn, Matt Murphy, and Paul Shaffer. The set list includes songs that appeared on the group's 1978 album, Briefcase Full of Blues. Dan Aykroyd, who provided editorial oversight and wrote a foreword for the graphic novel, spoke highly of the comic, which Felipe Sobriero illustrated, in a statement. “In this wonderful form of printed artistic expression we get to continue the legend of Jake and Elwood and pass it forward in ways that film can't,” he said. “This graphic novel keeps the spirit of the Blues Brothers alive; mischievous recidivists, musical outlaws who above everything care about the blues.” A new group of people attempt to find out. “The quest for the Briefcase, full of unearthed lyrics and music from the greats, is an honorable Grail,” Aykroyd said. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time In addition to the deluxe edition, which includes the vinyl, publisher Z2 Comics has also put together a “platinum edition” of the graphic novel, which includes a framed plaque signed by Aykroyd. It has also produced T-shirts with Sobriero's art. The Blues Brothers debuted on Saturday Night Live in a 1976 sketch, when they performed “I'm a King Bee” in bee outfits. Belushi and Aykroyd developed it further, wearing suits and sunglasses, on the show in 1978, and the novelty of seeing a couple of ultra-serious white guys deadpanning as blues aficionados became a hit. Briefcase Full of Blues came out that year and was a Number One hit on the Billboard 200. Following Belushi's death in 1982, Aykroyd regrouped the Blues Brothers with help from John Goodman for the 1998 movie, Blues Brothers 2000, also directed by Landis. The last Blues Brothers live album, 1997's Blues Brothers and Friends: Live from Chicago's House of Blues, featured John's brother James Belushi alongside Aykroyd.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not every day that Bruce Springsteen releases seven albums at the same time — 83 songs in all, going back over 40 years. But there's never been an archival project with the same crazed ambition of his new box, Tracks II: The Lost Albums. His 1998 Tracks was a crate-digging collection of vault gems that fans had spent years praying for — or hoarding on bootlegs. But Tracks II is a whole different ballgame: seven unreleased albums Springsteen made, trying out various genres and voices, spanning from 1983 to 2018. But the whole damn thing is a treasure trove. Tracks II is full of revelations because no artist has ever topped Springsteen's genius as an album-crafter — not just the songwriting, but the painstaking way he weaves these tunes into longform stories, piece by piece. So Tracks II is dazzling not just for the abundance of previously unheard songs, but for how he's built them into albums, including great ones like Inyo or Twilight Hour, or country and hip-hop experiments. Some of these records were seemingly finished and ready to go, except he decided to keep them on the shelf. For comparison, he's released nine albums in the past 25 years (two of them devoted to covers) so he's just doubled his 21st century output. He's got a sampler called Lost and Found, which has 20 superbly chosen highlights. But the point of Tracks II is engaging it on Springsteen's terms — as individual albums, each with its own place in his story. But for the first and only time, he was struggling to make an emotional connection with listeners. Without his rhythm section, his E Street audience got split down the middle by grunge and country, as Bruce got outflanked by Garth Brooks on the right and Eddie Vedder on the left. “I just felt kind of ‘Bruced out,'” he told Rolling Stone in a bombshell 1992 interview. Most rock stars of his generation had their lost decade in the Eighties, floundering through the era of shoulder pads, MTV, and video-game album covers, then got their mojo back in the Nineties. His Eighties run was so packed with highlights, the world is still catching up. If we get a whole Hollywood movie about Nebraska, does this mean we can also get movies about Tunnel of Love, the making of the “I'm On Fire” video, or the day Bruce and Little Steven got thrown out of Disneyland by security goons because Steve refused to take off his babushka? But for reasons nobody understood at the time, he entered his Bruced Out era, missing out on the Nineties rock boom. He even said living in New Jersey was “like Santa Claus at the North Pole,” and he knew exactly how inflammatory those words would be — it was his Plastic Ono Band “I don't believe in Jersey” moment. A rough time to be a fan, but he came back stronger than ever with his 1999 E Street Band reunion tour and The Rising; the man hasn't come close to a dud album since. Bruce Springsteen Says He Finished Recording a New Solo Album “I often read about myself in the Nineties as having some lost period or something,” he said in his album announcement. “I was still a little gun-shy of fame,” he admits in the notes. “I was unsure whether to immediately release Born in the U.S.A. after Nebraska.” Despite the title, there's no Nuggets-style garage band—it's the opposite, a man in retreat from his group, making solo demos in his home studio with an engineer. It's full of close-up character studies in the mode of Nebraska (“Jim Dear” and “Richfield Whistle,” both close to “Highway Patrolman”) or Born in the U.S.A. (the heartland angst of “Sugarland” and “Don't Back Down on Our Love”). It feels like a bridge between these two blood-brother albums, the Sergeant Joe and Frankie of his catalog. “Follow That Dream” is an Elvis tribute (named after one of the King's flat-out worst movies), a longtime concert fave that finally gets a studio version here. Streets of Philadelphia Sessions is a light genre exercise, devoted to drum loops and electronics, inspired by West Coast hip-hop. It's an experiment that's oddly insular, considering how Springsteen was the most influential artist in country at the time, with Garth, Clint Black, Joe Diffie, and so many others doing Bruce-style rock to feed the heartland's gigantic Springsteen craving. (Just to pick the most obvious example, Billy Ray Cyrus became an overnight Nashville superstar with his faux-Boss smash “Achy Breaky Heart,” which was the same damn song as “Pink Cadillac.”) Twilight Hours is a brilliant companion album to Western Stars, written at the same time (mostly 2011), exploring the same L.A. orchestral pop theme, twisting the bittersweet chords of Jimmy Webb, Henry Mancini, or Burt Bacharach. “Sunday Love” is a lush portrait of romantic agony — hope Brian Wilson got to hear this at least once before the final curtain. If you love Western Stars — an acclaimed masterwork at the time, yet one that just keeps sounding better over the years — he leans even harder into his crooner moves, going for Frank Sinatra/Al Martino smoothness in torch ballads like “Dinner at Eight” and “Sunliner.” The cocktail-noir drama “High Sierra” is one of the box's absolute peaks—he's a Bogart or Mitchum on the run from a past he can never escape, with debts no honest man can pay. Perfect World is the one cheat here — it's just a collection of stray songs, not an album he ever envisioned as a unit. But it's the right place to park loosies like “If I Could Only Be Your Lover” — a soulful lament too worldly to fit with the ghost stories on Wrecking Ball — or the mid-Nineties bangers “Rain in the River” and “I'm Not Sleeping.” “It's the only piece here not originally conceived as its own record,” he says of Perfect World. “I wanted just a little fun, noise, and rock & roll to finish the package.” Sabrina Carpenter Cold-Plunges Before Every Show and 16 Other Things That Didn't Make Our Cover Story ‘007 First Light' Ditches Franchise Lore for a Whole New James Bond Sabrina Carpenter Is Under Fire for a Spicy Album Cover. Tracks II is overpowering in its sheer abundance — you can spend entire weeks exploring these albums. It's loaded with songs that any other artists would have jumped at the chance to release—but not this guy, because good as they were, they just didn't fit into his overarching plan of the lifelong story he wanted to tell. That's why Tracks II ends up being a tribute to Bruce Springsteen's stubborn streak, which has been on fine display all year. Only an artist with that kind of obstinate integrity could have assembled seven albums this great, but decided not to release any of them. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman ruled that texts between pals Swift and Lively, at least any that specifically pertained to the movie and its behind-the-scenes drama, should be turned over to Justin Baldoni's legal team. Lively's side has repeatedly accused Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios partners of shameless PR when it comes to dragging Swift into the muck. But, as Judge Liman wrote (via Variety), “A motion or request may be, and in this case often has been, both a legitimate litigation tactic and an attempt to maneuver in the broader court of public opinion.” Baldoni's team tried to subpoena Swift, but dropped the idea after pushback from Swift, Lively, and the court; his lawyer had also alleged that Lively was extorting Swift for public support in the case (which she has not offered). Notoriously private, Swift's supposed unhappiness about being shoehorned into the drama has allegedly damaged her longterm friendship with Blake Lively, if the tabloids are to be believed. ​​“Baldoni's desire to drag Taylor Swift into this has been constant dating back to August 2024 … a strategy to influence the ‘TS fanbase,'” a spokesperson for Lively told NBC News in the wake of the judge's latest text message ruling. “We will continue to call out Baldoni's relentless efforts to exploit Ms Swift's popularity, which from day one has been nothing more than a distraction from the serious sexual harassment and retaliation accusations he and the Wayfarer parties are facing.” JEZEBELIt Took 25 Years, But Carrie Is Finally Burdened By the Weight of Family Fat Joe's hype man alleges rapper coerced him into "4,000 sexual acts," including with minors Taylor Swift text messages ruled fair game in Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni case</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The BBC greenlit Doctors Under Attack last year from Basement Films, the production company run by former Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear. It was meant to spotlight the plight of medics in Gaza, but production was paused in April following the scandal over Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone, the HOYO Films doc that was found to have been narrated by the child of a Hamas minister. International Insider: '28 Years Later' Arrives; Landmark Netflix-TF1 Deal; NHK At 100 BBC Hits AI Startup Perplexity With Legal Threat Over Content Scraping Concerns Now, the BBC has said it will not screen Doctors Under Attack, or carry any of its contents in news bulletins, after discussions with Basement “reached the end of the road” on Thursday. Therefore, we are transferring ownership of the film material to Basement Films.” The BBC will continue to cover events in Gaza impartially.” In a statement, Basement Films claimed that the BBC had approved the film for broadcast and it was considered a “vital piece of public service journalism.” “They gave us no less than 6 different release dates, and it was subjected to a long and repeated compliance process as well as scrupulous fact checking,” Basement said. “They then apologised and reversed their position and said that it would be subject to the recommendations of the Johnston report.” De Pear did, however, personally criticize BBC director-general Tim Davie on a public platform at the Sheffield DocFest on Thursday. “Something needs to happen because they are making decisions from a PR defensive point of view rather than a journalistic one. The BBC said it spent weeks with de Pear attempting to get Gaza doctors' voices heard. “Our aim was to find a way to air some of the material in our news programmes, in line with our impartiality standards, before the review [into How to Survive a Warzone] was published,” it said. The BBC added: “Contrary to some reports, since we paused production of Gaza: Doctors Under Attack in April, it has not undergone the BBC's final pre-broadcast sign-off processes.” The UK's Jewish community was appalled that the BBC screened a film narrated by a boy with Hamas connections that were not declared to viewers. Others argued that the BBC's decision to pull How To Survive a Warzone was an act of “censorship” that played into Israel's agenda. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter With more than 30 million devout followers, a podcast, a Grammy-nominated album and much more, the first family of Christian content is asking their fans to bet on Him — and on them. Allie Schnacky understands you may not buy it when she says Jesus Christ is real. She'd feel the same if God hadn't transformed her life: if He hadn't planted dreams and visions in her mind; if those visions hadn't then come true; if He hadn't worked miracles for her and her family. But before you turn away, heathen reader, allow her to explain. Allie is perched across the table from me on the porch at her family home, which is nestled along Lake Minnehaha in Clermont, Florida, a city 20 miles west of Orlando. Her bright blond hair is pulled into a slicked-back bun. Her maroon nails and gold Oura ring gleam in the dappled sunlight. Druski Movie in the Works With Kenya Barris Based on Viral Comedian's Short 'The Diggers' (Exclusive) Can Live Event Celebrity Group Chats Take Over the Second Screen? Today is the first time I've met Allie, but it's not the first time I've heard her testimony. Until now, the 25-year-old has existed only in the palm of my hand, just as she does for her 4 million TikTok followers, 1.68 million YouTube subscribers and 875,000 Instagram followers. I've watched her explain how to know if you're under spiritual attack, how her faith cures her anxiety, and how important it is to meet people, not just in the church, but “in the broken places they're at.” Together, the collective has a combined following of more than 30 million. But it's not just on social media that JWLKRS Worship (pronounced “J Walkers,” and you can guess who “J” is) and the Schnackys wield influence. In 2023, they began releasing music under the name JWLKRS Worship, and this year they attended the Grammys as first-time nominees for best contemporary Christian music performance/song. They're now developing a reality show with L.A.-based production-management firm Propagate Content. “God has changed my life,” Allie continues, across from me. Her leather-bound Bible sits on the table between us. JWLKRS Worship took off, as things did for many content creators, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was Noah and Colby who doubled down on TikTok first. In the beginning, their content didn't focus on faith — it was mostly pranks and glimpses of their daily life. “They just started making videos for fun because there was nothing else to do,” Allie says. She'd graduated from her public high school and was considering her next steps but had no interest in pursuing a career in social media. “[Social media] led me to spiral in so many different ways,” she says. “My brother was heavily involved in it, and people would always compare me to him even though he was my biggest supporter — as if my value was lesser than his because of a number on a screen.” Indeed, it was Noah who had the running start. The eldest Schnacky sibling began his entertainment career as a child actor and singer who built a modest following long before his time with JWLKRS Worship. As a preteen, he signed with the now-defunct A3 Artists Agency, began homeschooling and relocated to L.A. with Lance; his siblings and their mother, Kim, who worked as a pharmacist, stayed in Florida. His mom — Noah's grandmother — got him started in acting in seventh grade, and as a high schooler, he watched Universal Studios being built. He applied for a job and worked at the park's grand opening. “Anything to be a part of it,” he told me over the phone.) Over the years, Noah landed a slew of minor small-screen roles, one on an episode of How I Met Your Mother, but his breakthrough came in 2018 when he independently released “Hello Beautiful,” a country-pop single that went viral; its success led to a Teen Choice Awards nomination that year, followed by a 2019 record deal with Nashville's Big Machine Records, the country label best known for signing Taylor Swift as a teenager. (Noah left Big Machine in 2022 but plans to release solo music under Recapture Records, the family's label that also issues JWLKRS Worship's music.) But it wouldn't take long for Allie to follow in her brother's footsteps. “I was in my bed, crying, just feeling worthless,” she says. “I was able to share with others that they were known by God, as fully worthy.” Soon, about 2,000 people joined to watch the group for hours each night. “We'd encourage them in their faith, to find peace and joy in that hard time [through] God,” she says, “because that's where we got it from. Its core members — including the Schnacky siblings and Armstrong — had met nearly a decade earlier at church. In 2015, they founded an affiliated youth group, also called JWLKRS. But once they began collaborating, their followings exploded. The past five years have ushered in a new generation of massively popular faith-based entertainment ventures, including 2025's House of David, a biblical scripted series on Prime Video that was watched by 22 million people worldwide in the 17 days after its premiere, according to Amazon. There are also films including Sound of Freedom; with more than $250 million at the global box office, it was one of 2023's biggest theatrical success stories. Other content creators have risen to meet the moment, too. There's Sadie Robertson Huff, a podcast host and castmember of the A&E reality show Duck Dynasty; the actresses Angela Halili and Arielle Reitsma, who co-host the top-ranked faith podcast Girls Gone Bible; the hip-hop and spoken-word artist Jackie Hill Perry, who also wrote a memoir about renouncing homosexuality after converting to Christianity; Reece Weaver, a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader who uses her platform — which was bolstered by a prominent appearance in America's Sweethearts, Greg Whiteley's Netflix docuseries about the squad — to discuss her Christian faith; and Jeanine Amapola Ward, an author and podcast host who serves up traditional lifestyle content with a glossy New Testament twist. There's also Madison Prewett Troutt, a Christian author, podcast host and onetime finalist on The Bachelor. Prewett Troutt and her family, in particular, have parallels with the Schnackys; in 2023, her mother, Tonya Prewett, co-founded UniteUS, an organization that brings large worship music shows to American college campuses and baptizes hundreds of students on-site. (After praying about it, Prewett Troutt declined through her assistant to be interviewed for this story.) Each member's faith may be personal, but as a unit, they make a clear and savvy play for universal influence. I've asked him about the group's merch, which includes a black snapback hat emblazoned with a nod to President Trump: the words “MAKE AMERICA GODLY AGAIN” in white block letters. When I inquire about the slogan, he waves Noah over, telling me it was his son's idea: “[Noah] likes to throw a little controversy in,” Lance quips. “We don't put our faith in any man,” he says. “What we're trying to do is get away from the left versus right. “A lot of people come up to us [when we're wearing the hats]. They'll be like, ‘Oh, I love that hat.' But has Trump's re-election in November altered the group's perspective or strategy at all? But the family itself makes a lot of worldly noise. The Schnackys' business empire is varied and slightly nebulous. JWLKRS Worship is a nonprofit, but each of its creators earns income from their work across various social media platforms. Then there are additional entrepreneurial offshoots, including a partnership with an Israeli tourism company and plans to develop a sketch comedy series based in Nashville. “As for revenue, we usually keep that private,” Lance says. Whatever God puts in our hands — we try to use it faithfully and with purpose.” They put away ring lights and cameras and rearrange the pieces of a gray sectional to face the room's gargantuan flat-screen. They hoist a looming statue of an astronaut by the Filipino American artist known as Jefrë that served as a backdrop, returning it to its rightful place in the house's entryway. (The D'Amelio and Jonas families have similar Jefrë statues in their homes.) Allie crouches at her laptop, uploading the footage they've just captured. Noah and a few other creators are already livestreaming again. The combined effect is dizzying, similar to what living in TikTok's Hype House during its heyday must have been like, I imagine. “There's no real relationship with a majority of these groups,” she says. “But we don't live the same as everyone else. I ask Allie what she feels is the most misunderstood thing about her family. The Schnackys have acolytes, though — in their millions of followers and also in more than 5,000 faith-based TikTok Live creators signed to Recapture Livestream. I meet many of these other creators later that week when the family decamps to New York City for Recapture's Winter Games, a three-day live-streaming tournament for 225 of the agency's top creators at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. In each battle, several pairs go live on TikTok at the same time, asking for virtual tokens that viewers buy with U.S. dollars, which are then translated back into earnings for the streamer. (According to TikTok, in the U.S., most LIVE creators are eligible for a share of up to 53 percent of TikTok's net revenue from selling virtual items after deducting the required payments to app stores, payment processors and any other adjustments required under its terms and policies. According to Lance, Recapture Livestream does not take a cut of its creators' earnings, but TikTok compensates the agency directly for services it provides, including bringing “awareness” to the app's livestreaming function.) The games culminate in a final battle between the top two creators that will take place outdoors in Times Square and will be livestreamed on a 2,250-square-foot digital billboard. On my seat in the Marriott conference room is a sheet of stickers from Upward, a Christian dating app and the event's sponsor, featuring such phrases as “Faith Over Fear,” “Prayer Warrior” and “Grow in Grace.” I watch Lance lead a morning worship service, which also includes a live acoustic performance from JWLKRS Worship, composed of Noah, Ella, Armstrong and Hope. Afterward, Allie is all business, filming content for Upward and interviewing a steady stream of creators about their experiences with Recapture and how it's changed their lives. Mattah Parker, a 25-year-old creator and model, steps into the frame and recounts how joining Recapture helped her pay off medical debt from multiple surgeries to remove benign tumors in her breasts, as well as her continued treatment for Type 1 diabetes, a diagnosis she received during the pandemic. After filming, Allie shares with Parker how God has cured her own sicknesses. We stand in a circle as she prays over Parker, placing her hands on both of our shoulders, willing Him to cure her diabetes. “God, for her body, no medicine,” Allie says. Stroble begins to feverishly preach the Gospel; both creators shout into their smartphone cameras as viewers' gifts roll in. TikTok's live chat function, now projected dozens of feet high, floods with messages, including “Listen to God,” “Jesus loves you NYC! He leaps into the crowd, which hoists him aloft. Allie and I have just returned from a walk with Gatsby, the family's Bernedoodle. Back on the porch, Allie reflects on her journey; she can't quite believe the way it's played out so far, how fortunate she's been. “This isn't me trying to convert [you] or anything,” she continues. I ask her if she says this to everyone. “It's not like I meet somebody random and I'm like, ‘Oh yeah, God wants to know you,' ” she says. At one point, she reaches across the table to touch my forearm, bridging the gap between us for one fleeting moment. “I really believe you're here for a reason,” she says, resolute.
