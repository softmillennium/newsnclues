                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flamengo fought back to beat Premier League side Chelsea 3-1 in a thrilling Club World Cup 2025 clash. But the Premier League side completely capitulated during a disastrous second half, with Bruno Henrique and Danilo striking for Flamengo within four minutes to turn the game around. Nicolas Jackson was then sent off for Chelsea two minutes later before second-half substitute Wallace Yan added insult to injury by adding Flamengo's third. Flamengo 3 Chelsea 1 – Jackson sent off as Maresca's team implode at Club World Cup It's very complicated to come back in the game. When asked whether he has spoken to Nicolas Jackson after his sending off, Maresca added: “No. It was a red card, so nothing to say. Chelsea conceded three goals today for the first time since losing 3-0 against Brighton in the Premier League on February 14. It is their third time conceding three or more goals this year (also allowed three at Manchester City on January 25). Also, Flamengo's Gonzalo Plata registered two assists today. The last time he had two or more goal contributions in a match was November 14, 2024 with Ecuador against Bolivia in World Cup qualifying. Bruno Henrique's two goal contributions (goal and assist) marked his first appearance with two or more since February 2. Goalscorer and Flamengo veteran Danilo also chatted to DAZN post-match and he underlined their work rate as a key reason for winning. “We've been working really hard these last few weeks and we're showing on the pitch the work that has been. We kept our minds focused on what we have to do and the result came to our side.” OK, that was an awful challenge from Nicolas Jackson (not a happy birthday), but Chelsea had also lost control of the game before going down to ten men. Jorginho admitted his side believed they could win even despite being one down at the break. He said to Anita Nneka Jones on DAZN: “We were really confident and we know in these big games, details make the difference. Another former Chelsea player has spoken to the media... Nicolas Jackson was sent off for an awful studs-up tackle three minutes after coming on as a substitute as Chelsea imploded in six minutes of madness to lose 3-1 against Flamengo at the Club World Cup. Flamengo are now in control of group D, with all of Brazil's teams unbeaten at the tournament and Chelsea in a fight to qualify for the last 16. Flamengo 3 Chelsea 1 – Jackson sent off as Maresca's team implode at Club World Cup Victorious manager Filipe Luis spoke to DAZN after the match and he hailed his team's performance. He said: “I'm really happy for the game. My heart is warm right now because of this. One minute, five, 90, he always gives his heart. Is there anything better than watching your side, the underdogs, beating a more illustrious team? Looks a hell of an atmosphere in that Flamengo end at the Lincoln Financial Field! He sunk to his knees at the final whistle, and no wonder. But you can't really begrudge them another whirl of their club colours given the result, can you? Flamengo's comeback win is their first in all competitions since March 8 (a 2-1 win against Vasco da Gama in the Taça Guanabara semifinals). They went behind and have turned it around brilliantly with a backs-to-the-wall performance full of heart, guts, and grit. Yes, Chelsea imploded in six minutes with two quick goals conceded and Nicolas Jackson's red card. And yet, Chelsea are passing it around with little urgency. As against Newcastle, Chelsea have done pretty well to exert pressure on a nervy Flamengo with 10 men, but just as it was at St James' Park, it is too little, too late. Ayrton Lucas, the left-back and Brazil international, defends well, twice in a matter of seconds. First, he sprints back to slide in on Noni Madueke, who tested him for pace down the line. Into the first minute of seven added on, Flamengo make another two swaps. Gonzalo Plata is booked as he goes off for time-wasting, I think, and he jogs off with Luiz Araujo. On are attackers Pedro, the dangerous No 9, and Michael. I love when Brazilian footballers have English-style single names. Not long for Enzo Maresca's side to find two goals, down a man too. Another foul from Pulgar on Caicedo just outside the box, albeit a challenge he was always trying to pull out of, hence no second yellow. He is well placed, the Spanish sub, and shoots from a tight angle, but it's well blocked by goalkeeper Agustin Rossi who is swiftly off his line!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle Reign FC has five players called up to the United States Under-23 Women's National Team training camp in Commerce City, Colorado from June 23-July 2 – Emeri Adames, Maddie Dahlien, Emily Mason, Sally Menti and Maddie Prohaska. As part of the 24-player roster, the five players will attend cap from June 23-June 26, which will run concurrently with the United States Women's National Team, allowing Head coach Emma Hayes and her staff to observe training. The team will then attend the USWNT vs. Ireland match on June 26 at DICK'S Sporting Good Park before completing camp in Denver while the USWNT departs to finish its slate of matches. "The U-23 level is such a critical part of the pipeline, and to have five of our players called in shows that we're developing not just professionals, but future leaders for the national team. These players are stepping into their prime and we're proud to be part of that journey,” said Reign FC General Manager Lesle Gallimore. Mason and Dahlien were two of nine players included in the June-July camp that were called up for the Germany trip. Adames, Dahlien and Menti make up one third of the NWSL players on the roster that have scored a goal this season. Adames has been a consistent performer for the Reign in 2025, making nine appearances and scoring two goals. The forward is no stranger to international action, as she's racked up an impressive resume of experience across various youth national teams. Dahlien, another key part of the Reign's attack, has two goals and an assist in her 12 games for Seattle. Mason has played in seven matches for the Reign this season. She was named to the Concacaf U-20 Championship Best XI for her efforts as she helped record seven straight shutouts during their run to the title. Prohaska, who signed with the Reign in March after joining preseason as a trialist, has not yet made her NWSL debut. The Auburn standout has previously been called into Youth National Team camp.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Borussia Dortmund striker Serhou Guirassy admits he is looking forward to his first true taste of United States football culture at the Club World Cup. Dortmund are one of two sides flying the flag for the Bundesliga, alongside champions Bayern Munich, and still have to play Mamelodi Sundowns and Ulsan in a group stage which takes them from East Rutherford, New Jersey to Cincinnati, Ohio—their opening game with former Copa Libertadores winners Fluminense finished 0–0. The new format of this competition means there remains plenty of unknowns heading into the Club World Cup, but for Guirassy, one thing is for certain—the United States is set to put on a memorable show for everyone involved. “It's a World Cup,” he tells Sports Illustrated. “Plus, in the United States, we know it's like a football country. Especially now with [Lionel] Messi joining Inter Miami. So now they're even more focused on football, I'd say. So it's going to be a great competition.” This will not be Guirassy's first trip to the United States but, by his own admission, he has never before had the opportunity to immerse himself in a culture which continues to grow with each passing week. “I've been to the United States, but it was... it was really in flash mode, I would say.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DALLAS — Former Dallas Trinity FC midfielder Samantha Meza has been called up to the United States women's national team (USWNT) for June and July friendly matches, the team announced this week. The call-up marks Meza's first time reporting for the USWNT senior roster, and the first Dallas Trinity FC current or former player to be called into camp. Meza is one of six midfielders on the roster in this training window. Meza, a Dallas native, was drafted by the Seattle Reign in the 2024 NWSL Draft, but played for Dallas Trinity FC on loan in the first half of the inaugural USL Super League season. Meza returned to Seattle and made her NWSL debut on March 15 against against Gotham FC, coming on as a stoppage-time substitute. Meza became a regular starter and, according to her Reign teammate Lynn Biyendolo, became the "engine of [the Reign] midfield." Lynn talks @reignfc teammate Sam Meza, who just earned her first USWNT call-up. The 23yo midfielder was drafted by Seattle in 2024 & opted to go on loan with @dallastrinityfc in the USL Super League to get more playing time, a decision that proved instrumental in her career ✨ pic.twitter.com/6mLos5ZsId She played collegiately for the University of North Carolina and was a four-year starter. The USWNT will play against Ireland twice – on June 25 and 29 – and versus Canada on July 2.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid did not have the best of starts to their FIFA Club World Cup campaign, drawing 1-1 draw with Al-Hilal. Real Madrid's next match is on June 22, when they take on Mexican side Pachuca at the Bank of America stadium in North Carolina. Having played their first match in rough terrain, however, Real Madrid appear to have grown a bit wary of the pitch conditions in the United States, which may be sensitive to many European players. According to MARCA, Real Madrid took no chances ahead of their next matches and sent emissaries to inspect the quality of the pitches at the stadiums they are scheduled to play in. The move was made after concerns were raised by FIFA and reinforced by previous bad experiences on American soil, particularly injuries to key players during past pre-season tours. Real Madrid are determined to avoid any injury crisis heading into the new season. After reviewing the findings, the medical team advised against using players who have suffered ACL injuries in recent times, namely Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, and David Alaba. This recommendation does not necessarily mean the trio won't feature at all during the tournament, but it introduces an element of caution. Ultimately, any decision regarding their participation will be made collaboratively between the player, medical staff, and coach Xabi Alonso, based on how the players feel physically. So far, Militao is said to be ahead in terms of recovery and integration with the group, while Carvajal and Alaba continue to take it slower.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Congressman LaHood, who has served as a U.S. representative from Illinois for almost ten years, has been pressing the administration on several issues relating to the operations, logistics and security of the World Cup. They have lobbied the White House to sign off on a $625m federal funding request to assist security needs during the World Cup, which is edging closer, but he also believes a change to the law is required, which would best enable suspect drones to be taken out in the host cities. LaHood also serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which oversees the nation's intelligence agencies. President Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” includes $500 million to be made available until 2029 for “state and local capabilities to detect, identify, track or monitor threats from unmanned aircraft systems (otherwise known as drones).” The act must still pass through the U.S. Senate but is expected to do so. Trump has also signed a series of executive orders relating to drones in recent weeks, both aimed at increasing U.S. manufacturing of drones but also greater counter-drone capabilities. A White House fact sheet claimed that drones “pose a growing threat as criminals, terrorists, and hostile foreign actors increasingly weaponize these technologies to endanger public safety and national security.” A bipartisan coalition has been working within Congress to alter the law. Currently, only federal authorities are permitted to counter rogue drones but state and local authorities are often more heavily involved in securing events at stadiums or mass gatherings. The DEFENSE Act (Disabling Enemy Flight Entry and Neutralizing Suspect Equipment Act) would change this by granting temporary authority to state and local officers who have received appropriate training to use counter-drone technology and respond to threats. Rep. LaHood, however, believes an executive order may be necessary to ensure those securing World Cup games and fan festivals have the requisite training and powers ahead of the World Cup, which starts in June 2026. An executive order, he says, would establish a protocol to protect World Cup stadiums, with collaboration between the U.S. Military, the federal national security agencies and state and local law enforcement. “I was up at MetLife with the (White House FIFA World Cup) Task Force recently,” Rep. La Hood told The Athletic. We had all of the security apparatus there. We talked a lot about an executive order that will be needed because I'm not optimistic we'll pass legislation to establish the right protocols for what we need with drones for the 11 cities. If a drone flew over Russia at the World Cup in 2018, or Qatar (in 2022), it immediately gets shot down. There were mechanisms in place to do that. In the U.S., we have not regulated drones, there's (even) been a purposeful effort in Congress to let the drone industry prosper and thrive in the free market system. “There is legislation introduced by Senator Tom Cotton that would establish a protocol and this would be helpful for regulating drones. But I don't anticipate that's going to get the consensus of Congress between now and then. It's not as easy as it sounds but there will be one particular agency designated to secure the perimeter and make sure no drones are infiltrating the area where games are being played.” Wars going forward will always have drones. It's a delivery system to hurt and kill. The Super Bowl has a no-fly zone for drones. So there's counter-drone technology that is in place that basically keeps the environment from being utilised by drones. “How would they know if drones are in the air? The weighted net brings it down obviously over a nice area where you're not hitting cars and people, but there are counter technologies for that. It is normal that we do have a no-fly for the Super Bowl. Open-air stadiums will definitely not want to have a drone in their area.” He primarily covers soccer for The Athletic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What a Thursday night that was, drama in abundance at the Club World Cup and weirdest of all, a solid, professional and fairly quiet win for the USMNT. Could there be any more perfect way to get the weekend started? I'm James Benge, let's dive into the wonderful wonder of soccer.

Unless you happen to support one of those teams, there is nothing that makes intercontinental football more exhilarating than that. In what felt like a wonderful callback to his unforgettable first few weeks in pink, the great man found himself stood over a free kick just outside the D. You knew what was coming. That in itself was as much a triumph for young head coach Javier Mascherano as it was Messi's brilliance (and Ramos' shortcomings). As Chuck Booth notes, Inter Miami had weathered a Porto storm in the first half even after Samu Aghehowa's early penalty. The Herons came back with bite (or is that a stabbing motion from those long beaks) and were swiftly rewarded with Telasco Segovia's equaliser. Porto had been a fair way back in third place in the Portuguese league last season and were swiftly dumped out of the Europa League. Usually at the Club World Cup European sides have financial resources that vastly outweigh their opponents, but there was only one team on the field yesterday that could afford Messi and Sergio Busquets. This was the first competitive win by an MLS club against a UEFA opponent, but really, it was by some distance the best opportunity. You couldn't argue the field was as level in Pasadena. Botafogo might be one of Brazil's big 12, with a US owner in John Textor who has backed their development into Copa Libertadores winners, wowever they hardly have the resources to compete with Paris Saint-Germain, whose payroll is one of the most generous in sport. The European champions weren't at their absolute strongest, but you'd have fancied Luis Enrique's starting XI to overcome plenty of Champions League opponents, let alone Botafogo. Igor Jesus showed fight and speed to earn the lucky deflection that wrong-footed Gianluigi Donnarumma in the first half, and from there on Botafogo defended their lead manfully. John Victor had only one save to make after the opener while there were plenty of defenders around the world who could learn from how Alex Telles and company dealt with Desire Doue. He wasn't the only one to struggle, as Luis Enrique noted. PSG should have a chance to make amends in the knockout stages. Seattle Sounders are up next and though the MLS side are not absolutely eliminated after their 3-1 loss to Atletico Madrid, they'd need to beat the Champions League winners by a handy margin and hope for a favor from Botafogo against the Spaniards. That latter part does at least seem quite plausible with South American sides in the midst of their season proving to be more than a match for their tiring opponents from Europe. Sebastian Berhalter, son of former USMNT coach Gregg, was the latest to impress, delivering a gorgeous free kick from deep on the right which was just begging for Chris Richards to get a boot on it. That goal was more than enough in what was an impressive defensive display, Saudi Arabia limited to just three shots and 0.3 expected goals across the 90 minutes. It wasn't entirely without fault, Richards making a big tackle in the first half, and perhaps if the Arabian Eagles had had Salem Al-Dawsari in the XI they would have had more success in one on one duels. Still, whatever the level of opposition, it is no bad thing to so comprehensively shut them out. The attack, mind, was a little less effective, Diego Luna and Malik Tillman in particular quieter than they had been in the win against Trinidad and Tobago first time out. It didn't help either that Haji Wright was unavailable with an Achilles issue, one for which Pochettino was unable to offer a timescale on his recovery. The USMNT might need more attacking oomph to win the knockout games and yet given the absences of Folarin Balogun, Christian Pulisic and Ricardo Pepi -- to name but a few -- it always seemed likely that the goals would be harder to find in some games. 🤯 CWC upsets ranked: There have already been plenty of cupsets in the early days of the tournament, here's how they rank for shock value. 🩷 Inter Miami prove MLS worth: After a tough start for American clubs at the Club World Cup, Miami's win was just what the league needed. 🇺🇸 President Trump meets Juventus players: Juventus visited the Oval Office on Wednesday, a photo opportunity that soon turned strange as the president asked players about trans athletes and fielded questions about events in the Middle East. 🤔 Alonso's debut analyzed: There was plenty of intrigue in another disappointing result for the Europeans so how did Xabi Alonso change Real Madrid in their 1-1 draw with Al-Hilal?

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's a breakdown of five major storylines we were keeping track of before the games, and where we stand. That said, the raw attendance numbers have not been bad, considering that many kick-off times have fallen at noon or 3pm during workdays. There have been 20 games at the Club World Cup so far. About 730,000 tickets have been sold or distributed for these matches. The median percentage of capacity used – a figure that gives less weight to outliers such as the 3,142 who attended Mamelodi Sundowns v Ulsan in Orlando – is 45%. With a few exceptions, the tournament is being playing in massive NFL stadiums, and that means a lot of empty seats. The environments, though, have largely been very good. South American fans in particular have brought it, with Brazilians in New York and Argentinians in Miami creating noisy and invested atmospheres that seem right at home at a tournament with the World Cup name. It wasn't comfortable for the players either. “Playing in this heat is impossible,” Atlético's Marcos Llorente said. My toes hurt, even my toenails … We are adapting to the heat of playing at these hours … no one in Europe is used to it.” The next several days will see more of these situations. Evening kick-offs will be hot but theoretically bearable once the sun is down. And that's without even getting into weather delays. There is very little Fifa can do about those, of course – but it's a trend worth keeping an eye on. The opening matches of this tournament were awash with reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and/or Customs and Border Protection officers would be present at games and looking to continue their public raids, which have been met with counterprotests across the country. Make no mistake, security is high at these games, as they are at any major sporting event in the United States. But there haven't been any reported attempts at mass arrests as there have been in other places around the country. That is not to say politics, world events and the tournament haven't overlapped. Mehdi Taremi, Inter's Iran striker, has been forced to miss the tournament after being stuck in Tehran after Israel's attacks on the city. And this week Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino, and a delegation from Juventus (including the US internationals Weston McKennie and Tim Weah) stood in the Oval Office as Donald Trump answered questions about a potential war with Iran and awkwardly asked the players if women could play for Juventus (a reference to the rightwing talking point about trans women in women's sports). Teams representing Conmebol have not lost, the only undefeated confederation remaining after one matchday in every group. They've achieved some pretty big results along the way – including Botafogo's 1-0 win over the Champions League winners, PSG, on Thursday night, and Boca Juniors' 2-2 draw with Benfica. Asian and Oceanian teams are having far less fun. The confederations' five teams have yet to win, with Auckland City suffering a 10-0 demolition by Bayern Munich. The lone bright spot for Asian clubs was Al-Hilal's 1-1 draw with Real Madrid – a game in which the Saudi Pro League side looked every bit Madrid's equals in Xabi Alonso's first game in charge. Generally speaking, and in line with past editions of the Club World Cup, the so-called “smaller” teams are the ones bringing real life to this party, while most Uefa teams are waiting for their first big challenge. The final group games and knockouts should be plenty of fun. The Inter Miami superstar is a player Fifa bent over backwards to get into the tournament, awarding his team a “host nation” slot after they failed to qualify through other means. Messi is 37 and has clearly slowed a little, but he remains capable of delivering in big moments, as he did with a winning free-kick goal against Porto. Pretty much every Bayern player stands out after that ridiculous scoreline, even if it came against amateur opposition. For Manchester City, Phil Foden got off on the right foot with a goal and an assist against Wydad, and Chelsea's new signing Liam Delap made a positive impact on his debut, a 2-0 win over Los Angeles FC.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For 19-year-old Amina from Ifrane, a small mountain town known as the “Switzerland of Morocco,” dead dogs are a common sight. “Walking to school, I would pass pools of blood on the street,” she recalled in an interview with CNN. “At a certain point, I realized it wasn't normal to start your day stepping over dead bodies.” “There used to be occasional shootings every few months,” she said. Animal welfare groups say the killings are part of a campaign to “clean up” Morocco's streets ahead of the 2030 FIFA World Cup, which the nation is co-hosting with Spain and Portugal, while Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina will all host stage an opening match each. Jaïd added that the animals are rounded up and relocated to dispensaries where they can be vaccinated. Stepping outside, she discovered three dead dogs in a dumpster. One of them was a male husky she knew from the neighborhood. CNN cannot independently confirm who killed the dogs. CNN contacted Ifrane municipality for comment but did not hear back. “Around 100,000 people are bitten every year, 40% of them children under 15.” In 2019, Morocco's government introduced the Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (TNVR) program, a humane strategy to control stray dog populations. But there's a major obstacle: municipalities, not the national government, are responsible for managing stray animals. “Some cities still rely on traditional methods, and there's currently no law against killing stray dogs.” “We must deal with the issue in a different way,” Roudani said. CNN has verified footage of dog culling in cities including Marrakech, Casablanca, Agadir and Ifrane. Videos filmed as recently as May 2025 show dogs being restrained with metal wires and tossed into pickup trucks already filled with carcasses. Bystanders found him and he was rushed to a hospital in Casablanca, where doctors were unable to remove the bullets. “It's gotten to the point where people are in danger,” IAWPC chairman Ward told CNN. “You can't have shootings happening on the street – especially during a World Cup with thousands of tourists.” In a letter addressed to FIFA's Secretary General, conservationist Jane Goodall said she was “absolutely appalled” to see Morocco's government “engaging in large-scale killings of street dogs as part of an apparent effort to make FIFA World Cup venues more ‘presentable' to foreign visitors.” FIFA did not respond to the letter but told CNN in a statement that Morocco's World Cup bid “outlined its commitment to the protection of animal rights,” including the expansion of “clinics and support programs for stray dogs.” “FIFA is following up with its local counterparts with the aim to ensure commitments are upheld,” the statement said. As international scrutiny has grown, the dog catchers appear to have become more discreet, particularly in tourist hubs like Marrakech. Jane Wilson and Louise Jackson – two British residents living in Marrakech – told CNN that, until last year, vans openly displayed cages in the back with dead and alive dogs in plain sight. Now, unmarked white vans quietly patrol the streets, seizing stray animals, they said. In Casablanca, vans bearing the logo of Casa Baia, a municipal development company, are rounding up animals. Owned by the municipality, the company's website claims its “expert teams are permanently mobilized” to “capture and impound” more than 20,000 stray dogs per year. CNN reviewed footage prepared by an animal rights group showing dogs being dragged into Casa Baia vehicles with metal chains. Erin Captain, originally from Indiana, moved to Casablanca with her husband last year and quickly grew attached to the local strays. Captain told CNN that Casa Baia vans prowled the streets day and night. One night, she says, they came for her puppies. “One had its little legs broken; the other was kicked to death. My husband had to step in before they drove off.” “But the dog catchers came and killed them anyway,” she said. Reached by CNN, a spokesperson for Casa Baia declined to comment on accusations of killing stray dogs or using inhumane methods to capture stray dogs. FIFA has been aware of Morocco's dog culling since at least 2023. That March, the European Link Coalition (ELC), a UK-based NGO, met with senior FIFA officials to present evidence of a rise in culling ahead of the 2030 World Cup. The materials included dozens of photos, videos, and witness testimonies – some directly referencing Casa Baia. In April 2024, FIFA Human Rights Advisor Marta Piazza told ELC that the organization “truly valued” their input and was engaging with Morocco's government to “ensure alignment with FIFA's bidding requirements” – the checklist of services and standards expected of a prospective host nation. A “suggested way forward” was promised in the coming weeks. According to the ELC, FIFA then fell silent. The organization says it hasn't heard from Piazza or her colleagues since. In response to CNN's request for comment, FIFA said it is “in contact with animal welfare organizations on this important matter.” Morocco's government is taking steps to regulate dog culling practices. Last month, Roudani and his colleagues submitted a draft law mandating municipalities to stop killing stray animals and implement TNVR programs. In a statement to CNN, FIFA said it had contacted the Moroccan Football Federation and “received confirmation that a number of measures have been implemented over the last 5 years,” with new legislation in the works aimed at balancing public health and animal welfare. “Football fans around the world love dogs,” Minky Worden of Human Rights Watch told CNN. “Animal mistreatment could become a major PR issue if FIFA doesn't take concrete action.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pick:  Bayern Munich -0.75 First Half Asian Handicap (-133) My Bayern Munich vs. Boca Juniors best bet is on Bayern Munich -0.75 First Half Asian Handicap as I see value on the German side to win comfortably. Bayern put 10 past Auckland City in their opener and although Boca Juniors are a far better opponent, there's still a considerable gap between the Bundesliga champions and the Argentine outfit. Marcos Rojo (35), Rodrigo Battaglia (33), Ander Herrera (35), and Edinson Cavani (38) are far too slow to compete at this level – they are all regulars within Boca's starting 11. The Bundesliga champions were in incredible scoring form before they ran into Auckland City. They registered an average of 2.6 goals per game in their past five Bundesliga outings. Considering the Asian Handicap line is set at -2.0, you might have expected a more favorable outcome. Following BETSiE's train of thought, it brings the Under 3.5 Bayern goals selection into play and suggests four goals might be a step too far. There wasn't much to learn from Bayern's 10-0 hammering against semi-professional outfit Auckland City aside from the fact that Vincent Kompany is taking this competition incredibly seriously. Witnessing the Argentine's physical, aggressive nature versus Benfica will see them come into this one slightly more prepared. Boca was very much in Benfica's face from the first whistle. But, despite Boca enjoying a solid 30 minutes that saw them go 2-0 up, they once again pressed the self-destruct button despite having a man advantage. This is where Bayern can be more streetwise than the Portuguese. If Kompany's team can score first and take control, the gaps will start to appear for Boca, who were flat-footed towards the end of their first match. Boca's high energy was impressive, but in the hot conditions, it is unsustainable for 90 minutes. Bayern have so much quality across the pitch; they are a level above Benfica in front of goal, and Boca won't be able to live with them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gab Marcotti disagrees with Mauricio Pochettino's comments on Christian Pulisic after he misses the Gold Cup for the USMNT. Even with two wins to start the Concacaf Gold Cup, it appears the U.S. men's national team is in crisis. Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Yunus Musah have already asked out of the Gold Cup. Without something like 80% or 90% of the expected starting lineup next summer, it could have transformed into an opportunity for some fringe players to make a case to play a bigger role in Mauricio Pochettino's plans once the matches matter again. But then came the friendlies against Switzerland and Turkey: two losses, by a combined score of 6-1, against two teams the U.S. needs to be better than if it seeks a deep run in 2026. This was a group of players that didn't appear to care. Former USMNT star Landon Donovan ripped Pulisic's commitment to the national team. Pulisic's dad responded by screenshotting a conversation he had with ChatGPT. The AC Milan star told Donovan to say it to his face and revealed that he had asked Pochettino if he could play in the two friendlies and then skip the Gold Cup. This led to Pochettino clarifying his role as the manager who makes personnel decisions and his personhood: "When I signed my contract with the federation, I am the head coach. A year before co-hosting the World Cup, the USMNT under Pochettino promised to be on a steady upward trajectory. Instead, its best players are playing golf rather than soccer. The captain and coach are airing their dirty laundry in public. And that expensive, experienced, supposed-to-be-transformative coach has barely changed anything. That sounds like a disaster -- but it also sounds like the situation at pretty much every world-class national team at some point over the past decade. These are growing pains as the United States is slowly becoming a real soccer country. In the long run, that is a good thing. Let's go back to 1994, essentially the birth of modern American soccer as we know it. The U.S. was hosting the World Cup, Alexi Lalas was still a harmlessly peculiar guy with a bright-red beard and a guitar, the uniforms were acid-wash denim, and MLS didn't kick off for another couple of years. Almost none of the players were good enough to play abroad, and even if they could, there was still a stigma against signing American soccer players. The team trained together for two years and played in just about every international tournament it could enter. Four years later, no one was a full-time U.S. Soccer player, but 16 guys were playing professionally in a league that didn't exist in 1994: Major League Soccer. Then, at the 2002 World Cup, an MLS player won Best Young Player as a 20-year-old Landon Donovan led the USMNT to a quarterfinal loss against Germany. Donovan, though, was on loan to the San Jose Earthquakes from Bayer Leverkusen, who had just lost the Champions League final 2-1 to Real Madrid and that Zinedine Zidane goal. Donovan was shoved into an ecosystem that still didn't have a place for him. He was a superstar across the youth levels and had to carry the weight of American fan expectation on his shoulders. Donovan has talked about how hard it was to live in Germany and be a professional while his friends were still in high school, an ocean away. He was alone -- there was no one else like him, in a position like him, anywhere else in the world. If Donovan made it at Leverkusen, it would prove something about American soccer -- that our best players could play for the best teams in the world. So, unsurprisingly, playing for the USMNT meant a lot to him. On a more universal level, for him and most of his teammates, games with the USMNT were the highest-level matches they would play. These games were so important, in part, because they could push their limits. An increasing-but-still-small number of Americans started to play in Europe during Donovan's USMNT career, but most of them began in MLS. And because their numbers abroad were still so limited and most of them weren't competing for titles and playing in the Champions League, winning games with the USMNT was a way to legitimize American soccer -- even if it meant flying thousands of miles across the Atlantic Ocean every season. With teenage American prospects at almost every major club academy in the world, eight senior players in the current pool who cost at least $20 million in transfer fees, and a growing number featuring in the Champions League every season, the national team doesn't matter like it did. Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski are all incredibly wealthy, all-time great players -- and the main reason is what they've done for their club teams. But Mbappe has been paid over $400 million by the various club teams across his career, and Paris Saint-Germain paid around $200 million to acquire Mbappe ... the summer before the 2018 World Cup. He will go down as the best center forward of the 21st century -- solely because he has scored 500-plus goals for Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Barcelona. Messi, still in his prime, retired from the national team for a few months, partially because of frustration with the Argentine national federation. Mbappe briefly stopped playing for France -- missing multiple Nations League matches -- last fall. Then, Lewandowski said he would stop playing for Poland if Michał Probierz remained the coach, and now Probierz is no longer the coach. Similar to Lewandowski, the majority of players at the highest level are tired because they play too many games. The most recent study from FIFPro, the international players' union, found that 70% of surveyed players think a guaranteed rest period each season is necessary. For last season, the study defined 55 games played or more as an "excessive workload," and for the players who hit that mark, 30% of their matches were with their national team. "The schedule is very tough, especially for those of us from South America because we have 12-hour flights there and 12-hour flights back," said Real Madrid star Federico Valverde, who represents Uruguay at the international level. "There are times when it's too much for our bodies." This is the downside of what American soccer fans have been wanting. As more Americans are playing at the highest level in Europe, why wouldn't they also feel this way? Kasey Keller breaks down the situation between Christian Pulisic and Mauricio Pochettino, in which Pochettino said Pulisic isn't allowed to dictate games he plays in. His club teammate, Yunus Musah, would've broken the 55-match mark had he played this summer. Both of them have traveled over 85,000 kilometers (about 52,817 miles) this season between Milan's European matches and games in North America for the USMNT. In the FIFPro report for last season, they compared a number of young players with their older compatriots. At the same point in his career, Donovan had played only 280 times. "Pulisic, if not for injuries, would have an even greater distance, in terms of appearances, compared to Donovan. Overall, Pulisic's incredible number of appearances at such a young age has likely contributed to his worrisome injury record, having had the misfortune of missing close to 100 games since the 2017/2018 season through various injuries." There's a vision of a unified American soccer model -- a professionalized and well-defined way we play, where everyone is fully committed to the cause and developed within the same model. You can't achieve this when all of your players are spending 75% of their time doing the same job for someone else. At the club level, teams get to target the players they want, and then they get to specify how they want to play on the training ground every day. Your five best players might be goalkeepers, and there's nothing you can do about it. Oh, and then the roster changes almost every time the team convenes for a couple of matches and a few training sessions. And as for the number of truly meaningful games these teams play every four years? Herculez Gomez reacts to the USMNT's "embarrassing" situation after Christian Pulisic hit back at critics. As more and more Americans earn prominent roles in Europe, why should we expect this environment to produce anything other than drama, consternation and disappointment? Yes, Argentina is running hot right now, but it was the world's most depressing soap opera for the first 15 years of Messi's career. French fans hated how the team was playing pretty much until the final whistle in 2018, and it has as many World Cup wins as player mutinies. When it was managed by Luis Enrique, the guy who just won the Champions League with PSG, and it got knocked out in the round of 16 after attempting over 1,000 passes and not scoring a goal? Brazil has more raw talent than any nation not named France, and it has had four managers in the past two years. (Brazil is trying to win its first World Cup since 2002.) Germany seemed like it had cracked the code in 2014 -- and it hasn't been out of the group stage since. And England, well, England is home to the best soccer league in the world, and it has never won an international tournament that it didn't host. The expensive manager whom U.S. Soccer hired last year didn't immediately fix things because they never do. The players don't seem fully committed to their national team because no one is anymore. The former players are mad because soccer has already changed so much since they were playing. However, the beauty of international soccer -- really, the thing that makes international soccer what it is -- is that next summer almost none of this will matter. Four months later, Morocco was somewhere the USMNT would love to be next summer: playing in the World Cup semifinals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AUSTIN, Texas (June 19, 2025) — The U.S. Men's National Team overcame a gritty Saudi Arabia side 1-0 in the Concacaf Gold Cup Group Stage second match on a warm, humid night at Q2 Stadium. Defender Chris Richards broke the deadlock in the 63rd minute on a sliding short strike off a set piece free kick. Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter assisted Richard with a perfectly-arched pass from the right side. Richards' first score also came in Concacaf competition in the 2023 Nations League Final against Canada. ET / 6 p.m. CT (FOX, TUDN, ViX; SiriusXM FC, FDP Radio). Both squads finished the first 45 with two shots each and one on target. Richards making his third start of the year, helped hold Saudi scoreless with an impressive sliding block after a Green Falcon caught the U.S. off guard on a breakaway. The Al-Suqour played a 4-3-3 in contrast to Trinidad and Tobago's deep 5-3-2 formation. The Americans also dominated time of possession 67% compared to 33%. Mexico and Costa Rica in Group A also punched their tickets to the knockout round.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA Club World Cup is just six days old, but it has already provided a mixed bag of memorable experiences for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, whose trip to Southern California with Paris Saint-Germain marked his first visit to the U.S. “I was in shock,” the veteran winger said. After contributing two assists to a win in PSG's tournament opener, Kvaratskhelia was unable to get any of his game-high five shots past goalkeeper John Victor in Thursday's 1-0 loss to Brazilian club Botafogo before an announced crowd of 53,699 at the Rose Bowl. Inter Milan plays to a 1-1 draw with Monterrey in the FIFA Club World Cup, yet another tournament in an increasingly busy schedule for players and teams. Botafogo (2-0) leads the four-team group with PSG and Atlético Madrid (both 1-1) tied for second with a game remaining. With just two teams moving on, PSG will need a victory over the Sounders on Monday in Seattle to advance. A draw would also send it through if Atlético Madrid loses its final group-stage match with Botafogo. It wasn't supposed to be this hard for PSG, the reigning French and European champion and a heavy pre-tournament favorite. Botafogo, which won last year's Copa Libertadores, is the reigning South American champion, but it is just eighth in Brazil's 20-team Serie A 11 matches into the current season. Whether Thursday's upset helps the struggling Club World Cup find an audience, it's far too early to tell. But it can't hurt, especially since Inter Miami also made history Thursday with a second-half goal from Lionel Messi in a 2-1 win over FC Porto, marking the first victory by an MLS club over a European rival in a competitive match. The Club World Cup is the largest and most lucrative global club competition in soccer history but attendance has lagged in the early going, averaging just 36,433 through 20 matches. Six games have drawn more than 50,000 fans, including both of Paris Saint-Germain's matches at the Rose Bowl. But two got fewer than 5,300, with just 3,412 showing up in Orlando for a game between South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns and South Korea's Ulsan HD and 5,282 for Pachuca-RB Salzburg at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati. “The atmosphere was a bit strange,” Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said after his team beat LAFC in its tournament opener before nearly 50,000 empty seats at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Paris Saint-Germain defeats Atlético Madrid in its FIFA Club World Cup opener at the Rose Bowl, but expanding its fan base in the U.S. will be an even bigger win. That the competition hasn't produced more interest is largely FIFA's fault. Powerful Real Madrid, playing with Kylian Mbappe in 89-degree temperatures and 71% humidity in suburban Miami, struggled to a draw against Saudi club Al-Hilal while Atlético Madrid wilted under bright summer skies at the Rose Bowl in its first game. “Playing in this heat is impossible,” Atlético's Marcos Llorente told reporters. At a time when many other professional sports teams in Los Angeles are staying silent amid ICE raids, Angel City is using its platform to support immigrants. “No one in Europe is used to it. It will be no cooler next year when the real World Cup returns to North America for the first time in 32 years. And in that sense, this summer's tournament is making good on one of its aims by exposing national team players to the kind of weather, travel and atmosphere they can expect then. “We're going to come prepared next year,” said Inter Milan's Marcus Thuram, who played in the 2022 World Cup final for France. “It's good preparation to manage the jet lag. As for Thursday's game, Kvaratskhelia, PSG's most dangerous attacker, was frustrated twice in the first 10 minutes, with Victor batting down his first shot and the second curling wide of the far post. That allowed Igor Jesus to put Botafogo in front to stay shortly before the intermission, splitting a pair of PSG defenders to run on to Jefferson Savarino's perfectly weighted through ball, then beating keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from the top of the box. A team spokesperson later said the visit ‘carried no political agenda.' It was the first goal PSG has allowed in 366 minutes in all competition and it was all Botafogo would need, although Savarino nearly doubled the lead eight minutes into the second half, putting a strong header on goal that Donnarumma batted down. PSG dominated statistically, controlling the ball for three-quarters of the game, making more than three times as many passes, taking 10 corners to one for the Brazilians and outshooting Botafogo 16-4. But all four of Botafogo's shots were on target while Victor was called on to make just two saves. Times staff writer Nathan Solis contributed to this story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team clinched a spot in the knockout round of the Concacaf Gold Cup after a grind-it-out 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia in Austin, Texas, on Thursday, June 19. Props to them," Richards told Fox Sports after the game. Sometimes you've got to get physical, sometimes you've got to get nasty, and that's exactly what we did tonight." As expected, Saudi Arabia proved to be a much tougher opponent to break than Trinidad and Tobago, which the U.S. steamrolled 5-0 on Sunday, June 15. On Thursday night, it took until late in the first half for the U.S. to even manage a shot on goal. For their part, the U.S. was equally as stingy defensively, allowing just one shot on goal the entire game. USA TODAY Sports provided updates and highlights for the Concacaf Gold Cup match between the USMNT and Saudi Arabia: Tempers flared after Tyler Adams was pushed to the ground. Both Saudi Arabia manager Hervé Renard and U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino got involved as players from both teams got into a scrum. Sebastian Berhalter was issued a yellow card, as were Saudi Arabia's Ziyad Al Johani and Abdulrahman Al Obud. The USA-Saudi Arabia Gold Cup match finally had a breakthrough, as Chris Richards scored off a free kick from Sebastian Berhalter in the 63rd minute. The USMNT was not able to break down their disciplined opponents and make any threatening attempts on goal in the first half. In the 45th minute, Patrick Agyemang's header attempt was on goal, but Saudi Arabia 'keeper Nawaf Al Aqidi made an easy save. Haji Wright, who came on as a second-half substitute and scored a goal on June 15, is not with the U.S. team for Thursday night's game against Saudi Arabia. Mauricio Pochettino is going with the same starting 11 as the U.S. featured in Sunday's win over Trinidad and Tobago. For Sebastian Berhalter and Alex Freeman, the start against Saudi Arabia represents a third national team cap for each player. Saudi Arabia is coming off a 1-0 win over Haiti in its Gold Cup opener. Forward Firas Al-Buraikan (known as Feras) is the team's most-capped active player (52). Saudi Arabia is the eighth different non-Concacaf affiliated nation to be invited to compete in the Gold Cup. The Gold Cup is a biennial tournament for national teams in the North and Central American and Caribbean region associated with Concacaf. Mexico won the last Gold Cup competition in 2023.
