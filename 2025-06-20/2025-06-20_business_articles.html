                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta approached artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI about a potential takeover bid before ultimately investing $14.3 billion into Scale AI, CNBC confirmed on Friday. One person familiar with the talks said it was "mutually dissolved," while another person familiar with the matter said Perplexity walked away from a potential deal. Meta did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Meta's attempt to purchase Perplexity serves as the latest example of Mark Zuckerberg's aggressive push to bolster his company's AI efforts amid fierce competition from OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet. Zuckerberg has grown agitated that rivals like OpenAI appear to be ahead in both underlying AI models and consumer-facing apps, and he is going to extreme lengths to hire top AI talent, as CNBC has previously reported. Meta now has a 49% stake in Scale after its multibillion-dollar investment, though the social media company will not have any voting power. Earlier this year, Meta also tried to acquire Safe Superintelligence, which was reportedly valued at $32 billion in a fundraising round in April, as CNBC reported on Thursday. Daniel Gross, the CEO of Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman are joining Meta's AI efforts, where they will work on products under Wang. Gross runs a venture capital firm with Friedman called NFDG, their combined initials, and Meta will get a stake in the firm. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on the latest episode of the "Uncapped" podcast, which is hosted by his brother, that Meta had tried to poach OpenAI employees by offering signing bonuses as high as $100 million with even larger annual compensation packages. "I've heard that Meta thinks of us as their biggest competitor," Altman said on the podcast. "Their current AI efforts have not worked as well as they have hoped and I respect being aggressive and continuing to try new things."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a request from two toy companies to expedite their challenge to President Donald Trump's tariffs. Two small family-owned companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, argued that Trump lacked authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose his April 2 tariffs. The companies earlier this week asked the Supreme Court to expedite consideration of their challenge and bypass a federal appeals court. Rick Woldenberg, the chairman and CEO of Learning Resource and hand2mind, told CNBC that the Friday Supreme Court decision "was a disappointment but honestly just another twist in the road." "You want to win every motion but sometimes you don't," he said, adding that, "ultimately this showdown will be at the Supreme Court." Trump declared a national economic emergency under the IEEPA to justify implementing his tariffs without first getting congressional approval, a strategy that has drawn legal challenges from businesses and individuals questioning his authority The U.S. Court of International Trade last month temporarily blocked Trump's tariffs, saying that the IEEPA, which became law in 1977, does not authorize a president to implement universal duties on imports. But a federal appeals court earlier this month allowed Trump's tariffs to remain in effect until it hears arguments on that case at the end of next month. — CNBC's Lori Ann Wallace contributed reporting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Semiconductor stocks declined Friday following a report that the U.S. is weighing measures that would terminate waivers allowing some chipmakers to send American technology to China. Commerce Department official Jeffrey Kessler told Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Taiwan Semiconductor this week that he wanted to cancel their waivers, which would allow them to send U.S. chipmaking tech to their factories in China, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF declined about 1%. Nvidia and Qualcomm also fell about 1% each, while Marvell Technology and Taiwan Semiconductor slipped about 2% each. The latest reported move by the Commerce Department comes as the U.S. and China hold an unsteady truce over tariffs and trade, with chip controls a key sticking point. The countries agreed to the framework of a second trade agreement in London days ago after relations soured following the initial tariff pause in May. U.S. chipmakers have been hit with curbs over the past few years, limiting the ability to sell advanced artificial intelligence chips to China due to national security concerns. During its earnings report last month, Nvidia said the recent export restriction on its China-bound H20 chips hindered sales by about $8 billion. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call that the $50 billion market in China for AI chips is "effectively closed to U.S. During a CNBC interview in May, he called getting blocked from China's AI market a "tremendous loss."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla has inked its first deal to build a grid-scale battery power plant in China amid a strained trading relationship between Beijing and Washington. Utility-scale battery energy storage systems help electricity grids keep supply and demand in balance. They are increasingly needed to bridge the supply-demand mismatch caused by intermittent energy sources such as solar and wind. Chinese media outlet Yicai first reported that the deal, worth 4 billion yuan ($556 million), had been signed by Tesla, the local government of Shanghai and financing firm China Kangfu International Leasing, according to the Reuters news agency. Tesla said its battery factory in Shanghai had produced more than 100 Megapacks — the battery designed for utility-scale deployment — in the first quarter of this year. One Megapack can provide up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours. "The grid-side energy storage power station is a 'smart regulator' for urban electricity, which can flexibly adjust grid resources," Tesla said on Weibo, according to a Google translation. According to the company's website, each Megapack retails for just under $1 million in the U.S. Pricing for China was unavailable. The deal is significant for Tesla, as China's CATL and carmaker BYD compete with similar products. CATL was also expected to supply battery cells and packs that are used in Tesla's Megapacks, according to a Reuters news source. Tesla's deal with a Chinese local authority is also significant as it comes after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on imports from China, straining the geopolitical relationship between the world's two largest economies. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk was also a close ally of President Trump during the initial stages of the trade war, further complicating the business outlook for U.S. automakers in China. The demand for grid-scale battery installation, however, is significant in China. In May last year, Beijing set a new target to add nearly 5 gigawatts of battery-powered electricity supply by the end of 2025, bringing the total capacity to 40 gigawatts. Tesla has also been exporting its Megapacks to Europe and Asia from its Shanghai plant to meet global demand. Capacity for global battery energy storage systems rose 42 gigawatts in 2023, nearly doubling the total increase in capacity observed in the previous year, according to the International Energy Agency.

The Ozempic Effect:

Millions more Americans should be taking weight-loss drugs to prevent heart disease, according to the American College of Cardiology. 

Exercise and a clean diet aren't always enough for heart health, the nation's top cardiology organization said in new recommendations released on Friday. Weight-loss drugs should be used earlier, making them part of the first line of defense for obese patients, the group said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. crypto exchange's main European base has been in Ireland since 2023. Coinbase said Friday that it obtained its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) license from Luxembourg's Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). MiCA is a sweeping regulation that aims to create a harmonized legal framework for crypto across all 27 EU member states. The rules, which came fully into force late last year, also aim to reduce risks for consumers buying crypto assets following a series of scandals in the sector. It makes Coinbase the first U.S. crypto exchange to receive a MiCA license. Rival firm Gemini, which is owned by the Winklevoss twins, is expected to receive its own EU license from Malta soon. Gemini chose Malta as its MiCA hub in January. "Coinbase is all in on Europe, and we're advocating for crypto's future across the continent," Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC. "MiCA has set the standard, and Luxembourg is leading the way with its pro-business climate and thoughtful approach to regulation." Previously, Coinbase decided on Ireland as its central EU hub in 2023 and launched a big public relations blitz around the move at the time. However, the company ultimately backtracked on this decision, concluding Luxembourg would make more sense for its status as a "forward-thinking financial hub." "The decision was made less-so due to Ireland, but rather for the reasons that Luxembourg presented a highly compelling option," Daniel Seifert, vice president and regional managing director of EMEA at Coinbase, told CNBC. Luxembourg has four blockchain-related policies that have been signed into law, whereas Ireland currently lacks any crypto-specific laws. He added that Coinbase is still investing heavily in Ireland with "imminent" plans to add around 50 jobs to its local Dublin office. Rival exchanges Bybit, OKX and BitGo have all secured their own respective MiCA licenses. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bank on Friday is set to unveil new tools that allow investors to research and purchase bonds and brokered certificates of deposit through its mobile app, CNBC is first to report. Users can set up customized screens and compare bond yields on the same banking app or web portal that they use to check their account balances, according to JPMorgan executives. "Our goal was to create an experience that makes it extremely simple for clients that want to buy fixed income," said Paul Vienick, head of online investing at JPMorgan's wealth management arm. "We've taken that exact thought process for the simplicity of [buying] stocks and ETFs and moved that into the fixed-income space." JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets and a leader across most major categories of finance, is relatively puny compared with other online brokerages. Despite seeing steady gains in recent years as it added functions including the ability to buy fractional stock shares, the bank has only recently crossed $100 billion in assets under management, CNBC learned. That pales in comparison to online investing giants including Charles Schwab, Fidelity or E-Trade, which have had decades to accumulate investors and acquire competing platforms. The bank first attempted to snare more of the trillions of dollars that self-directed investors hold by launching a free trading service in 2018. JPMorgan called it "You Invest" and marketed the new name in a push that included prominent placement at the U.S. Open in tennis. That year, with the business managing about $55 billion in assets, CEO Jamie Dimon called out the firm's product in his usual blunt way. "We don't even think it's a very good product yet," Dimon told analysts at a financial conference. "There was a recognition that in wealth management, we have some catching up to do overall," Vienick said in a recent interview at the bank's midtown New York headquarters. That also includes managing more money for wealthy Americans through financial advisors at physical locations, a push that was helped by JPMorgan's 2023 acquisition of First Republic. The industry now recognizes that providing good online tools is table stakes, even if the emphasis had previously been on human financial advisors who earn more revenue by providing more services. Around half of those who use a financial advisor also invest on their own with online tools, Vienick said. Now, the bank is looking to target more engaged investors, those who research and buy stocks a few times per month and who are more inclined to purchase bonds directly rather than owning them through mutual funds. It's all part of the bank's efforts to convince customers who bank with JPMorgan already or have its credit cards to consolidate more of their wallet with the firm. Doing so will allow an investor to have a single view of their finances and move money instantaneously between accounts, Vienick said. The bank's advantages — its vast branch network, deep balance sheet and reputation under Dimon — have Vienick confident that JPMorgan will eventually join the other large players among online brokerages. "I have every belief the self-directed business outside of core wealth management can be a trillion-dollar business," Vienick said. It's going to mean we're delivering what clients are asking for."

The US Capitol in Washington, DC.

Thousands of private government consultants laid off during the Trump administration's cost-cutting crusade are increasingly flooding a shrinking labor market. 

Job postings among seven of the 10 consulting companies singled out by the General Services Administration for contract cuts are down about 27% since 2023, and about 11% from a year ago, according to data scraped from job boards by labor market analytics firm Lightcast.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I make no difference between my children. There are those who were conceived naturally and those who come from my sperm donations," Durov said. I don't want them to tear each other apart after my death." "I wrote my will very recently," he told Le Point, adding, "I decided that my children would not have access to my fortune until a period of 30 years has elapsed, starting from today." Durov explained that he wrote a will despite being only 40 because his work involved risks and he had enemies from within "powerful states." He set up Telegram in 2013 after previously founding the Russian social media network VK. Telegram has about 1 billion active users globally. Durov was arrested last year after French authorities accused him of being complicit in allowing criminal activity to occur on Telegram. He again denied all the criminal charges laid against him. In an interview with Tucker Carlson earlier this month, Durov said he was still unable to travel freely almost a year after being arrested. Asked about the comparisons with Elon Musk, he told Le Point he was very different from the world's richest person: "Elon runs several companies at once, while I only run one. Elon can be very emotional, while I try to think deeply before acting — but that can also be the source of his strength." Like Durov, Musk also has several children. In response to a comment about his youthful appearance, Durov said his exercise routine involved 300 push-ups in a row, followed by 300 squats.</p>

Marketplaces are wary of listing counterfeits, but do customers really care?

Mélissa B. checks a pair of Saint Laurent shoes.

Dressed in a white lab coat, Mélissa B. slips on thin cotton gloves and gently places a Zanzibar blue Hermès Birkin bag, its iconic orange box, a cloth dust cover, and various documents on her desk. She steps back to eye the $18,000 purse, hunting for any bulges or bends. She runs her fingertips along the top, then picking up her pocket-size magnifying glass, she leans in to examine a palladium plate on the flap. The logo has evolved over time, but the engraved text has remained sharp and well-defined, with the characters evenly spaced. “This is one of the key Birkin features to check,” she says.

She shifts her gaze to the stitching, checking for consistency and uniformity. The four palladium feet on the bottom of the bag get a check to ensure they're made of the same metal as the rest of the hardware, and that they're hammered, not screwed, in place. Then she homes in on the zipper—ensuring it's one made by Hermès in-house, with its distinctive H-shaped stopper at the end. </p>
