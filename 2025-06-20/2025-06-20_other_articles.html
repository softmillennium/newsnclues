As Prime Video subscription holders wait for the fifth and final season of The Boys, sweet teases and behind-the-scenes details are being shared by the cast and crew. The raunchy superhero drama can be pretty unpredictable, but something that's definitely known about the new episodes is that there will be a Supernatural reunion. Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins are joining Jensen Ackles for Season 5, and Ackles just opened up about why the reunion felt like “being home.” After it was revealed that he would indeed be back for Season 5, it was announced that Padalecki and Collins would be appearing in undisclosed roles. Kripke previously shared what it was like seeing the three reunite, and, while promoting his upcoming Prime show, Countdown, Ackles revealed to TooFab what it was like working with them again: You know, Jared and Misha are brothers to me. Even though the trio frequently sees each other at conventions and appear to keep in touch in other ways, for them to actually work together again on set is something else entirely. Ackles and Padalecki starred on Supernatural for all 15 seasons, while Collins joined in the fourth season. And, since then, their friendship has grown into a brotherhood. Based on the comments above, it seems like not much has changed in the five years since their former show ended. The drama's series finale was divisive among fans for a number of reasons but, with Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins coming together on The Boys, there's a possibility that Kripke could (spiritually) rectify all of that. Regardless of whether that happens, as a fan, I'm just excited to see the three actors to share the screen again. Amazon Prime Video: 30-day free trialWith an Amazon Prime membership, you can stream The Boys, the upcoming Countdown and other great original titles. Or why not save 22% by paying $139 upfront for the whole year? The Boys' final season is currently set to be released in 2026 and, unsurprisingly, a specific release date has yet to be announced at this point. Even though fans have to wait for more Soldier Boy, there's more content featuring Jensen Ackles on the way. Fans can keep occupied by watching Ackles' newest series, Countdown. The series, which also stars Eric Dane and Jessica Camacho, will premiere on June 25 on Prime Video, and Supernatural fans cannot get enough of Ackles. Eric Kripke is a shrewd producer, and I'd imagine that he would bring Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins together without having a good reason. For now, know that all 15 seasons of The CW show are streamable with a Netflix subscription.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CHICAGO (WLS) -- This week on "Windy City Weekend," Val Warner was off, so Ryan Chiaverini was joined by ABC7 Chicago reporter Jasmine Minor. In their "Host Chat" segment, they talked about a study which found that a simple sit-to-stand test can predict whether you'll die in the next 10 years. Chiaverini demonstrated it, and over 4,000 people aged 46 to 75 tried it, and the ones who could do it easily were six times less likely to die of heart and lung issues over the next decade. They also talked about a BuzzFeed study looking at "harmless conspiracy theories" that people think might be true. Her portrayal of Celie is anticipated to be a deeply moving and authentic journey. Williams is stepping into the iconic role of Shug Avery, the glamorous and free-spirited blues singer who becomes a pivotal figure in Celie's life. Williams brings her experience from "The Color Purple" National Tour, where she played "Squeak," and a host of other notable regional and Chicago credits, including "Memphis" and "Dreamgirls." Audiences will have the opportunity to experience this powerful musical through July 27, 2025, at the Goodman's 856-seat Albert Theatre. Beyond the performances, the Goodman Theatre is offering a variety of complementary programming, including a "Color Purple Book Club" event on June 28, and a "Pride Night Out!" Tickets for "The Color Purple" are currently on sale and can be purchased through the Goodman Theatre's website, GoodmanTheatre.org/Purple, or by calling their box office at (312) 443-3800. Chiaverini and Minor then introduced a taped segment about Darvin Furniture & Mattress. Darvin Furniture & Mattress is offering big savings under the big tops and great deals throughout the store. After five years and countless customer inquiries, the Darvin Tent Sale returns to Orland Park from June 20-23. For customer convenience, there will be a Cashier Tent. There are also special in-store offers in the Orland Park Showroom: 45%-65% off plus 36-month special financing and features special buys, last-chance bargains, one-of-a-kind items, overstocks and floor samples. For more on Darvin Furniture & Mattress, visit www.darvin.com. The store is located at 15400 LaGrange Rd #25 in Orland Park. Chiaverini and Minor then welcomed film critic Richard Roeper into the studio. '28 Years Later' - SpendRoeper also gave a good review for "28 Years Later," the latest installment in the post-apocalyptic horror series directed by Danny Boyle. Before saying goodbye, Chiaverini and Minor mentioned that "Windy City Weekend" will be hosting a studio audience for its show on Friday, June 27.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, this doesn't mean that I don't love and appreciate the episodes that the cast members have picked out as their favorites. Starring Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as Sam and Dean Winchester, brothers and monster hunters who travel across the U.S., Supernatural is one of the most important fantasy shows of the 21st century. While there are a few installments of the series that haven't stood the test of time, both of these episodes are just as fun to watch today as they were when they first aired. Even as an audience member, it's obvious in every moment of the installment that the actors are having tons of fun and love getting to lean into unexpected parts of their characters. It's an incredibly meta episode, but Supernatural excels when it gets to delve into high-concept territory like this. The episode follows Sam and Dean after they're transported to what appears to be our reality, where they're the actors Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles on the TV show Supernatural. It's an incredibly meta episode, but Supernatural excels when it gets to delve into high-concept territory like this. However, while "The French Mistake" is far from one of Supernatural's worst episodes, that doesn't mean there aren't some overlooked installments that better define the series. It might not break the show's formula or make you laugh, but that doesn't mean it isn't relentlessly engaging and memorable. "The French Mistake" is pure fun and entertainment, but there's always been more to the substance and tone of Supernatural than this. However, this isn't the only reason why "Swan Song" should be remembered and counted as such a pivotal installment. Padalecki gives one of his best performances of the series, giving his all to playing both Sam and Satan, which is never easy for any actor. However, each actor has their moment to shine throughout "Swan Song." The show changes a lot after season 5, and this episode works both as a seamless transition to this new era and a fitting goodbye to the first few years of Supernatural. The relationship and bond between Sam and Dean are at the forefront of "Swan Song," and episodes that uplift this dynamic will always be some of the best. Their connection as brothers anchors every season of Supernatural, and its strength is made clear in the episode. This comes in handy in the later seasons when heaven and hell insert themselves into the Winchesters' lives even further. There are a few significant deaths throughout "Swan Song," but many of them are reversed, with beloved characters quickly returning in the following season. However, these resurrections don't lessen the impact of "Swan Song" or its events. In fact, it makes it even more satisfying to watch the episode unfold while knowing what the future holds. There's no question that everyone loves it when a Trickster appears, and the Winchesters have to find a clever way out of a sticky situation, usually accompanied by more relaxed stakes and tension. However, "Swan Song" flipped the script on this. As a season finale and the end of the first era of Supernatural, "Swan Song" dug into serious territory to great effect. Supernatural is a TV show well known for following a procedural formula in many cases, but these episodes broke the mold in unforgettable ways. Since it was initially intended to be the series finale, a lot of significant plot and character development is wrapped up in "Swan Song."

Rod Serling wrote various Twilight Zone episodes during the show's original run, and his best one shows why the series is a timeless masterpiece. There have been three movies in the Rage Virus-driven "28 Days Later" franchise, all of which are good — but which one stands out as the best? NBC's "Blackout Thursday" was a huge deal back in 1994, but despite the likes of Friends and Mad About you taking part, Seinfeld famously refused.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You'd think a detective discovering he's descended from ancient monster hunters would lean into the camp of it all, but Grimm took that premise and went completely dark with it. When it kicked off in 2011, the show was a fantasy procedural, but it quietly morphed into a complex, mythology-rich series that never stopped dishing out surprises. Sure, it gave us the creature-of-the-week format, but it also crafted a brooding supernatural underworld full of conspiracies, bloodlines, rebellions, and centuries-old vendettas. This all unfolds against the backdrop of Portland, Oregon. At the center of it all is Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli), a homicide cop turned reluctant Grimm, whose lineage forces him to confront not just monsters, but his own sense of right and wrong. And as each season, Grimm further dove headfirst into its lore, drawing viewers into a world where fairy tales were real, and they bled. But it wasn't all bogeymen and Blutbaden, beneath it all, there was always a slow-burning story about identity, legacy, and the cost of power. This was long before Geralt of Rivia grunted his way through courtly politics or Harry Dresden slung spells while solving mysteries. Giuntoli's Nick Burkhardt was doing both and in a button-down shirt, no less. It seems straightforward enough till he realizes that Rocky, the guy he's looking for, is about to be ritually sacrificed by a family of Jagerbars Wesen reenacting a twisted coming-of-age ceremony in the woods. Later, in Season 1, Episode 10, “Organ Grinder,” Nick and Hank (Russell Hornsby) investigate missing homeless teens, only to discover they're being harvested by Geiers for their organs. At some point, his double life starts bleeding into everything, and the people he loves get dragged into the vortex of chaos. Hank nearly loses his mind after too many unexplained Wesen run-ins. And then there's Sergeant Wu (Reggie Lee), who gets bitten by a Skalengeck and ends up battling lycanthropia — a rage-fueled, were-creature-like condition that transforms him forever. At some point, being a Grimm wasn't just Nick's familial responsibility; it became the slow, contagious unraveling of everyone around him. In more ways than one, that's the magic of Grimm. Besides being monsters-of-the-week, the Wesen were deeply weird, weirdly deep, and packed with personality. The Fuchsbau (fox-like), Blutbad (wolf-ish), and Skalengeck (lizardy creeps) weren't just spooky to look at; they all came with their own species history, alliances, and ancient beef. That blend of creature and character was Grimm's true secret weapon. The VFX and practical prosthetics work deserves an award retroactively. Or the Löwen — basically lion-Wesen who ran underground fighting rings in Season 1, Episode 12, “Last Grimm Standing” — every snarl packed narrative weight. No show on network TV at the time was this committed to making monsters feel real. Meanwhile, Grimm didn't just show you the beast; it showed you the therapist bills and workplace tension that came with it. You know how most monster-of-the-week shows start feeling like a Scooby-Doo rerun after five episodes? Grimm took the format, but served up a show where every creature mattered and even came with receipts. Instead of throwing in a new Wesen every Friday night, the show gave each one cultural roots, family trees, grudges, and increasingly heavy baggage. Take Season 1's “Organ Grinder” — a dark, gritty episode featuring Geiers (vulture-like Wesen) harvesting organs from homeless teens. That's not just creepy body horror; it offered up social commentary wrapped in claws and folklore. Or Season 2, Episode 9 “La Llorona,” which taps into a Latin American legend to deliver one of the show's most haunting standalones. The Wesen-of-the-week could easily be a metaphor for addiction, abandonment, prejudice, or even depression, and often, they were. So, rather than just checking off episodes, Grimm was building a weird, wounded world one creature at a time and daring viewers to pay attention.

This would be the rise to power that Elayne deserves. This unexpected scene in the dystopian series' finale actually makes perfect sense. At this point, we're all well aware of what loss is.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EERIE new footage taken by the US military has captured a never-before-seen disc-shaped UFO mysteriously darting through the air. Most UFOs caught on camera have a sort of pill shape, but this one looks straight out of a science-fiction movie. The video was taken by the military on November 23, 2020, and it was released after Corbell spent years verifying the footage with inside sources. He said that US officials themselves admitted the UAP was a "disc" with an unknown origin. They said the craft "displayed abrupt movement and intelligent control" as it can be seen flying to the right before suddenly changing directions. The UFO also noticeably doesn't give off any heat signatures or signs of thermal propulsion like a normal aircraft would. "This is the first time in history that military filmed footage of a disc-shaped UAP, designated as such by the military, has been captured on camera and released to the public," he said. The object is believed to be between 200 and 400 meters in diameter, but Corbell said that the size is debated. The journalist claims that he's spoken with service members who had first-hand experience witnessing the footage. He called for Congress to respond to the video and said that military whistleblowers are ready to testify and describe what they saw. Corbell hopes that releasing this footage will encourage transparency from officials who witness UAPs. We know it's real," Corbell's cohost George Knapp said in their podcast Weaponized. "It was not supposed to be made public. Corbell previously told The Sun that UFOs have been kept a secret so that militaries can adapt their technology for warfare. And he released disturbing details about a "huge alien aircraft" that was caught hovering over a US military base. THE Tic Tac UFO is a mysterious flying object that U.S. pilots and experts have claimed to have witnessed over the last few decades. Commander David Fravor believed it to be something beyond human technology - as it possessed extreme acceleration and no visible propulsion. Then in 2015, pilots on the USS Roosevelt off the East Coast captured footage of unidentified moving objects. They also showed no means of propulsion and moved at high speeds. Speculation online has caused alien fanatics to look for more Tic Tac-shaped space paraphernalia, including a Russian military base which appeared to be a Tic Tac UFO "charging hub". The Pentagon has also acknowledged other declassified videos of encounters, but have been unable to explain them. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. This service is provided on News Group Newspapers' Limited's Standard Terms and Conditions in accordance with our Privacy & Cookie Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bodenheimer, who served in the Air Force for 13 years, said the large craft suddenly appeared out of nowhere during a training mission and looked to be on a collision course with his plane. 'Then I realized we weren't going to hit, and all of a sudden it came more into view, and it was a rectangular shape. This was like essentially a perfect rectangle,' Bodenheimer revealed in his video on June 8. Bodenheimer added that this craft had no visible vapor trail coming from an engine, no radar signal, and was traveling at approximately 400 knots (460 miles per hour). 'It really was defying any type of aeronautical laws that I've learned,' Bodenheimer said. Bodenheimer then revealed that his report to air traffic control left officials in 'dead silence' before the entire matter was apparently dismissed as an 'anomalous object.' The strange rectangle UFO got so close to Bodenheimer's F-16 Falcon at 30,000 feet in the air that he said he could make out every detail of the craft before it eventually flew off and was never seen again. When air traffic controllers in Denver asked Bodenheimer if he could give them any more details about the UFO, he revealed that it had a cream-colored interior that became transparent or had a hole in its center. The only evidence of Bodenheimer's sighting was a report made by air traffic control saying that an object had been spotted in the area where the Thunderbirds were training that day, but he never heard from anyone about the incident again. The former combat officer explained on his channel, Max Afterburner, that this UFO could not have been a weather balloon, a high-tech drone, or some kind of light trick. It was right down our wing line, a 30 to 50 foot object,' the pilot continued. Bodenheimer then speculated whether this could have been an extraterrestrial craft, noting that he's never been a fan of 'science fiction' but admitted that his encounter matched many of the incidents involving military pilots that 'defied physics.' It stayed completely vertical as if the wind did not affect the UFO's ability to fly at over 400 mph. On this day, the mysterious jet-like object flew past Bodenheimer's F-16 as his squadron was coming in for a landing. 'This lightning-fast triangle blitzed past me as we were setting ourselves up on a final [approach],' the pilot revealed. 'I just remember this thing going massively fast past me... It had basically done an interceptor maneuver, a dust-off. So maybe this was its way of having fun, saying maybe this should be Top Gun 3,' Bodenheimer detailed. The pilot noted that he hopes coming forward will encourage more of his fellow pilots to reveal what they've seen during their time in the military, noting that there have been roughly 800 UFO reports in just the last four years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Pyramids of Giza in Egypt have remained an object of fascination for historians, archaeologists, and the public for centuries. The question of who built these monumental structures and how continues to cause debates. In recent years, the hypothesis about possible extraterrestrial involvement in their creation has again attracted attention thanks to new research and publications. According to the generally accepted scientific version, they were constructed by thousands of workers using complex but available technologies of that time, such as levers, rollers, and inclined planes. In 2024, Dr. Amina Hassan, an Egyptian archaeologist from Cairo University, published a study in which she analyzed unusual geometric features of the pyramids. Hassan does not directly claim extraterrestrial intervention but emphasizes the need for further research. Crow refers to ancient texts, such as Sumerian tablets, and suggests that extraterrestrial civilizations may have transferred technologies to the Egyptians. He points to similarities in architectural styles between pyramids in Egypt and Mesoamerican cultures, separated by thousands of kilometers and centuries. Modern technologies, such as lidar scanning and 3D modeling, have allowed scientists to better understand the construction process. For example, in 2023, an international team of archaeologists discovered the remains of an ancient canal near the Giza plateau, which was likely used for transporting materials. Others point to possible influences from neighboring cultures, although there is little concrete evidence for this. Despite the popularity of theories about extraterrestrial involvement, the scientific community continues to seek answers in archaeological data and technological reconstructions. New discoveries and technologies may shed light on this ancient mystery in the future, but for now, the Pyramids of Giza remain a testament to humanity's engineering genius.

However, I'm also not one of those folks who refuse to believe that we're all alone in this giant universe of ours. They call Montana "Big Sky Country", and that's for good reason. And according to one source, it seems there are a lot of Montanans out there seeing things other than stars in those big skies of ours. The Action Network, which allows folks to place bets on sports and other activities, put together some research on U.S. States and UFO sightings. (Apparently, you can bet on anything, including the odds of seeing a UFO in Montana) Oh, and UFO sightings aren't new in Montana; in fact, there have been a couple of famous sightings over the years, including one near Great Falls that allegedly shut down the nuclear missile silos for a short period. Oh, and in case you're wondering who beat us out, that would be the state of Vermont. It should be noted that we're right on the heels of Vermont. I mean, I feel like if just a couple of more folks who might be afraid of ridicule would come forward, we could overtake that number one spot. I mean, we're talking about minimal effort here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And Trump isn't alone in that regard: From MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell to FBI Director Kash Patel, many MAGA Republicans still refuse to believe that Trump was voted out of office in 2020. In an opinion column published on June 19, MSNBC's Steve Benen tears apart a "nonsensical" new 2020-related conspiracy theory that Patel is pushing. READ MORE: 'MAGA hates Fox News': Trump goes on Truth Social rampage against 'crooked' network "As part of the same tweet thread," Benen explains, "Patel referred the public to an article from John Solomon, another Trump ally, who reported on an unsubstantiated claim from an unidentified source about China producing driver's licenses to be used in a mail-in ballot scheme. Those inclined to take any of this seriously should probably think twice….. Rick Hasen, an election law expert…. told NBC News that while Patel's post 'might feed the MAGA base,' what he was promoting was an uncorroborated story of unknown origin 'with no evidence that anything actually happened, and certainly no evidence that any ballots were cast or illegal voters were even registered to vote using state identifications.'" Benen adds that "conspiracy theorists on the right who hoped that this might finally confirm their baseless ideas should probably start lowering their expectations now." "That said, this week's unfortunate developments were a timely reminder that Trump isn't the only one still embracing nonsensical ideas about his 2020 defeat nearly five years later," the MSNBC journalist writes. Trump slammed for move to end ban on Russia-tied carcinogen Benen's column and Patel's new conspiracy theory are generating a lot of discussion on X. Podcast host Jack Hopkins, a former Republican, tweeted, "This isn't just absurd — it's criminal neglect.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discover how psychic capitalism is gaining traction as more people turn to intuitive guidance, astrology, and spiritual coaching for personal and business decisions in 2025. The Rise of Psychic Capitalism: Why People Are Turning to Intuitive Guidance The decline of institutional trust has reshaped how people seek clarity. In a landscape defined by burnout, fractured attention, and unstable career paths, a different infrastructure is taking hold, not built on productivity or optimisation but on interpretation. Tarot readings, astrology, and psychic consultations, which once sat at the cultural margins, now serve a quiet but significant function: helping people process uncertainty. Without stable narratives, symbolic systems offer flexible tools for navigating ambiguity. They're frameworks, ways of making emotional complexity visible and, in some cases, manageable. Self‑improvement often sells transformation through structure: journals, therapy, habit trackers, and guided apps. But when your mind is overwhelmed, these tools can feel like extra noise. Intuitive services, on the other hand, offer something different. An astrological chart doesn't tell you what to fix. It helps you reflect on what's already there. These symbolic tools aren't clinical; they're conversational. And sometimes, that's precisely what we need. Instead of constantly asking, “What should I do next?” more people are learning to ask, “How do I feel right now?” That shift from strategy to self-reflection is decisive. Today's intuitive guides, or emotional facilitators, frame their services in practical, grounded terms. Instead of promising life‑changing revelations, readers meet real human needs: navigating a career shift, unpacking a relationship, or clearing emotional fog. Rather than following a single guru, users now connect with intuitive readers based on modality (tarot, astrology, energy healing), emotional tone, or relational focus. Many find their way to online spaces supporting this kind of emotional exploration. Platforms offering psychic reading services make it easier to connect with intuitive practitioners based on style, modality, or emotional tone, creating a more personalized and accessible experience. Why do people return to these services, even if they're not believers? An astrological transit can explain why you've felt off-balance or disconnected. They offer metaphors, which help us make meaning. They give emotional shape to what often feels intangible or unspoken. In a culture that usually expects quick fixes or polished answers, symbolism gives us space to explore without judgment, an open-ended form of gentle and profound insight. That kind of symbolic fluency often gets overlooked in conventional self-help. Where logic and efficiency dominate, intuitive practices offer a gentler language rooted in process, presence, and personal rhythm. There's also a quiet but essential transformation within the intuitive space: readers reframe their role. The best guides won't tell you what your future holds. Instead, they'll help you have your present with more clarity. Credible platforms include advisor profiles, user reviews, and transparent session expectations. This emphasis on clarity nudges users toward empowerment, not dependency. Of course, intuitive tools aren't a cure-all. But used with intention, they create something rare: a ritual that slows the moment down and makes it meaningful. A ten‑minute reading won't solve your challenges but might help you see them differently. Ultimately, the rise of what's been dubbed “psychic capitalism” isn't evidence of a cultural obsession with mysticism. It reflects a deeper hunger for emotional rhythm and attunement. Because sometimes, the most powerful form of clarity isn't knowing what's next.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former US combat fighter pilot claims a UFO encounter he had while zipping around in the sky at 30,000 feet was one of the “wildest experiences” he's had in his seasoned military career. Maj. Ryan Bodenheimer, a former ace of the US Air Force Thunderbirds and F-15E combat fighter pilot, recounted on his YouTube channel earlier this month how he came close to almost colliding with a UFO shaped like a “perfect rectangle” while on a training mission in southern Wyoming. Bodenheimer alleged that he was flying during the day at about 30,000 feet in the sky, at a speed of 400 knots (460 mph), when a “bright object” caught his attention off in the distance, “out of nowhere.” However, Bodenheimer realized that the object was on a “collision course” with his aircraft. “I put my hand on the control stick, I'm about to turn off the autopilot, and then I realized we weren't going to hit, and all of a sudden it came more into view, and it was a rectangular shape,” he said. Bodenheimer, for a moment, theorized that the object could be a weather balloon, but he claimed that it didn't look like anything he had ever seen in the sky before. Aerodynamically, this thing shouldn't be going at close to 400 knots. He said that he wasn't picking up any signal on his radar and wasn't experiencing any radio interference as it kept pace with his jet at 400 knots just a short distance away. “It really was defying any type of aeronautical laws that I've learned,” Bodenheimer shared. The suspected UFO then “zooms off,” and Bodenheimer said he called into air traffic control to report the encounter. “I never heard anything about it [after],” the former fighter pilot said. However, he did do some searching of his own and said there was a report filed that day on an “anomalous object” spotted in his area. Bodenheimer said for years he never wanted to discuss his two run-ins with UFOs after worrying about the “stigma” around other pilots who have shared their encounters. The city of Cheyenne, which is home to Warren Air Force Base, has had over 50 reported aerial phenomena, out of the state's 421 sightings since 1995.</p>
