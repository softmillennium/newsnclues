                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Friday granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration's efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students. It marks another victory for the Ivy League school as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer put off any more rulings Friday. Instead, he asked for briefings from both sides on whether the Posse Comitatus Act is being violated. That act prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil. Breyer also asked the attorneys to address whether he or the appellate court retains primary jurisdiction to grant an injunction. Friday's preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs preserves the ability of Harvard University to host international students while the case is decided. It marks another victory for the Ivy League school as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House. The exact conversation couldn't be heard, but Trump spoke to a crew of workers for several minutes. Trump also had two towering flagpoles erected outside the White House. Protesters stand off against California National Guard soldiers at the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles during a “No Kings” protest on Saturday, June 14, 2025. California's challenge of the Trump administration's military deployment on the streets of Los Angeles is back before a federal judge. Friday's hearing in San Francisco comes after an appeals court handed Trump a key procedural win. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said that for now, Trump can keep control of the California National Guard troops he deployed in response to protests over immigration raids. Despite the appellate setback, California's attorneys are expected to ask a judge Friday for a preliminary injunction returning control of the troops in Los Angeles, where protests have calmed down in recent days. Lawyers for the Palestinian activist had asked a federal judge to immediately release him on bail from a Louisiana jail, or else transfer him to New Jersey, where he can be closer to his wife and newborn son. The judge previously determined that Khalil couldn't continue being held based on the U.S. secretary of state's determination that he could harm American foreign policy. Gavin Newsom has worked its way through the courts, and, on Thursday, an appellate court ruled in the president's favor. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded it was likely Trump lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the guard. It said that while presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's guard, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for doing so, citing violent acts by protesters. “The federal government's interest in preventing incidents like these is significant.” Tanjam Jacobson, of Silver Spring, Md., holds a sign saying “Citizenship is a Birthright,” Thursday, May 15, 2025, outside the Supreme Court in Washington. “This is something that really matters,” says Jacobson, “it's so wrong against the constitution [to take away birthright citizenship].” (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The justices released six opinions on Friday on everything from California emission standards to a lawsuit filed by victims of terrorism attacks. That leaves 10 cases still to decide, including Trump's executive order denying birthright citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who are in the country illegally. The order has been blocked by lower courts. These nationwide court orders have emerged as an important check on Trump's efforts and a source of mounting frustration to the Republican president and his allies. ▶ Read more about what's left for the Supreme Court this term California National Guard and Marines hold back demonstrators at the Federal Building during a protest Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Los Angeles. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded that Trump can likely show that he lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the California National Guard — and that even if the federal government failed to notify the governor of California in advance as required by law, Newsom had no power to veto the president's order. Trump celebrated the decision on his Truth Social platform, calling it a “BIG WIN.” He wrote that “all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done.” ▶ Read more on developments following the appellate ruling Vance's office did not release a topic of discussion for his visit. The state sued for a temporary injunction to stop the deployment, but a federal appeals court ruled in Trump's favor Thursday night while that legal challenge continues. The evidence is MASSIVE,” Trump posted Friday on his social media site. He added, “A Special Prosecutor must be appointed. This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! Trump has for years claimed, without evidence, that Democrat Joe Biden only won the 2020 election because of widespread voter fraud. Evidence presented in courts showed this didn't happen — judges, including some appointed by Trump, rejected nearly every claim of widespread fraud as false or frivolous. A special prosecutor in Biden's Justice Department investigated Trump's efforts to undermine the 2020 election, but that probe ended when Trump won back the White House in 2024. U.S. stocks are drifting higher following the Juneteenth holiday. Treasury yields also edged higher in the bond market after Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the U.S. military will get directly involved in Israel's fighting with Iran. Oil prices have been gyrating as fears rise and ebb that war could disrupt the global flow of crude. “The stock market's risk premium isn't just rising — it's recalibrating for a world where every macro lever now doubles as a tripwire,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management wrote in a commentary, adding that traders are bracing for what comes next. Trump's tariffs agenda may have been eclipsed by the conflict in the Middle East, but it remains another major factor weighing on markets, Innes said: “A delayed fuse is still a fuse.” Trump on Thursday signed an executive order to keep TikTok running in the U.S. for an additional 90 days, giving his administration more time to broker a deal that would bring the social media platform under American ownership. The first extension was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban — approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court — took effect. The second was in April when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump's tariff announcement. It is not clear how many times Trump can — or will — keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far there have been no legal challenges to fight them. We'll answer a few each day during our live coverage.</p>

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier joins ‘America Reports' to explain why he was held in civil contempt of court over a state immigration law. City commissioners in Miami, Florida, voted 3-2 on Tuesday to allow police officers to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The city entered a 287(g) partnership with ICE, which various cities use to assist with federal enforcement using different methods. It's a sharp contrast to some governments throughout the United States, especially in major cities, which do not allow local or state authorities to help enforce immigration laws. "We value our partnerships with state and local law enforcement, and the success of the 287(g) program allows for a force multiplier in enforcing immigration laws," an ICE spokesperson said in a statement. "This whole-of-government approach enables law enforcement partners to protect cities across the nation from public safety and national security threats, and we encourage others across the country to join." Ron DeSantis issued an Executive Order for state-level law enforcement to establish agreements with ICE to assist in the Trump administration's deportation efforts. "By allowing our state agents and law enforcement officers to be trained and approved by ICE, Florida will now have more enforcement personnel deputized to assist federal partners. That means deportations can be carried out more efficiently, making our communities safer as illegal aliens are removed." Ron DeSantis speaks during a news conference in Miami, May 9, 2023. "This is a shameful day for Miami," Dariel Gomez, Statewide Organizer with the ACLU of Florida said in a press release. This agreement will not make us safer – it will only spread fear and isolate the very people who make our city strong." "287(g) doesn't belong in any city, but especially not in Miami – a place shaped by immigrants, built by immigrants, and powered by immigrants," Tessa Petit, Executive Director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in a statement. "More than half of our residents are foreign-born. The commissioners who voted to implement this ruthless program have turned their back on the very community they were put into office to protect. They are turning our diversity into a target." "President Trump's promise to deport illegal aliens is a key plank of his agenda to Make America Safe Again. In April, a massive ICE operation in collaboration with Florida authorities led to the arrest of 1,120 illegal immigrants, and the agency said 63% of them had "existing criminal arrests or convictions," and many had alleged gang affiliations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A woman lays flowers in front of a National Guard as protesters gather to denounce ICE, U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement, operations Tuesday, June 10, 2025, in Los Angeles. Protesters stand off against California National Guard soldiers at the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles during a “No Kings” protest on Saturday, June 14, 2025. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — California's challenge of the Trump administration's military deployment in Los Angeles returned to a federal courtroom in San Francisco on Friday for a brief hearing after an appeals court handed President Donald Trump a key procedural win. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer put off issuing any additional rulings and instead asked for briefings from both sides on whether the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil, is being violated in Los Angeles. Newsom said in his complaint that “violation of the Posse Comitatus Act is imminent, if not already underway” but Breyer last week postponed considering that allegation. The appellate decision halted a temporary restraining order from Breyer, who found Trump acted illegally when he activated the soldiers over opposition from California Gov. Despite the appellate setback, California's attorneys are expected to ask Breyer on Friday for a preliminary injunction returning control of the troops in Los Angeles, where protests have calmed down in recent days, to Newsom. Trump, a Republican, argued that the troops have been necessary to restore order. The demonstrations have appeared to be winding down, although dozens of protesters showed up Thursday at Dodger Stadium, where a group of federal agents in SUVs and cargo vans had gathered with their faces covered a parking lot. The Los Angeles Dodgers organization asked them to leave, and they did. On Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass lifted a curfew in downtown Los Angeles that was first imposed in response to vandalism and clashes with police after crowds gathered in opposition to agents taking migrants into detention. Breyer found that Trump had overstepped his legal authority, which he said allows presidents to control state National Guard troops only during times of “rebellion or danger of a rebellion.” “The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of ‘rebellion,'” wrote Breyer, a Watergate prosecutor who was appointed by President Bill Clinton and is the brother of retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. The appellate panel ruled otherwise, saying presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's guard, but said that by citing violent acts by protesters in this case, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for federalizing the troops. It's the first deployment by a president of a state National Guard without the governor's permission since troops were sent to protect Civil Rights Movement marchers in 1965. Trump celebrated the appellate ruling in a social media post, calling it a “BIG WIN” and hinting at more potential deployments. “All over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done,” Trump wrote. Newsom, for his part, has also warned that California won't be the last state to see troops in the streets if Trump gets his way. We will press forward with our challenge to President Trump's authoritarian use of U.S. military soldiers against citizens,” Newsom said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Diplomacy window: US President Donald Trump said he will allow two weeks for diplomacy before deciding whether to launch a strike in Iran. • On the ground: Iran launched a fresh barrage of missiles toward Israel today, with at least one missile striking the northern city of Haifa. This latest attack comes as Iran and Israel traded strikes overnight, with no signs of de-escalation in their weeklong conflict. • Israel threatens Iran's leader: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out targeting Iran's supreme leader, saying “no one in Iran should have immunity,” after Israel's defense minister said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cannot be allowed to “continue to exist.” Addressing the UN Security Council, Rafael Grossi said that Bushehr was “the nuclear site in Iran where the consequences of an attack could be most serious.” He said that as an operating nuclear power plant, Bushehr holds “thousands of kilograms of nuclear material.” “I want to make it absolutely and completely clear. In case of an attack on the Bushehr nuclear power plant, a direct hit would result in a very high release of radioactivity to the environment,” he said. Grossi added that an attack that would disable the plant's power supply lines could cause its reactor's core to melt, which could also result a very high release of radioactivity. Israel has destroyed half of Iran's missile launchers, according to the Israeli military's chief of staff, who warned his country must be prepared for prolonged military action. “Thanks to a powerful and surprising opening strike, we achieved extraordinary results,” he said. As well as eliminating Iran's senior military command and dealing significant blows to its nuclear program, Israel had destroyed surface-to-air missile batteries and around half of its missile launchers, some just “minutes” before launch, Zamir said. But he warned Israel “must be ready for a prolonged campaign” to “remove a threat of such magnitude, against such an enemy.” He continued that pilots from Israel's air force are “operating at the greatest range and intensity in the forces' history” to strike Iran in “powerful” waves of attacks. Zamir also tied Israel's operations in Iran to the 53 remaining hostages who were taken by Hamas on October 7, 2023. He added that Israel is preparing for a wide range of possible developments. Although we have made significant achievements, difficult days still lie ahead,” he added. Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly described how Zamir's message was delivered. The Trump administration on Friday sanctioned several foreign companies, a Chinese individual and a cargo ship to undercut Iran's military capabilities as its conflict with Israel rages on. We have been clear: those who enable these schemes will be held accountable,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. Israel expects the European officials currently meeting with their Iranian counterparts in Geneva, Switzerland, to “demand a complete rollback” of the Iranian nuclear program, an Israeli diplomatic source told CNN on Friday. “Israel is not a part of this meeting,” the source said. “We expect the European foreign ministers to take a firm stance vis-a-vis Iran and demand a complete rollback of the nuclear program, the dismantling of its ballistic missile arsenal and program, and putting an end to its regional terrorist activities and active support for its terrorist proxies.” Our embassy continues to operate remotely,” a spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said. “We take the protection of our staff and British nationals extremely seriously and we have long advised against all travel to Iran,” the spokesperson continued. Protesters took to the streets of central Tehran to demonstrate against Israel's strikes on Iran as well as US President Donald Trump's administration. CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports what he sees on the ground: Farahani said that Iran would not support halting nuclear enrichment — which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes — but added that concessions were possible. Some context: In recent days, European powers have joined American and Israeli calls for a ban on enrichment, hardening their positions on the key issue, with France putting forward “a clear position on zero enrichment,” France's foreign ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine told CNN today. Iran says it needs enriched uranium for peaceful purposes, while also manufacturing large quantities of near-weapons-grade material. “If America gets involved in the war,” Farahani said, “there are so many options, and all those options are on the table.” Correction: An earlier version of this post included the wrong title for Farahani. Nearly two dozen people were wounded in parts of Israel on Friday, emergency services said, after Iran unleashed a fresh barrage of missiles. At least 23 people were injured, Israel's Magen David Adom (MDA) said. When I exited the shelter, I saw that the windows in my house were shattered, and there was a lot of broken glass,” Ahmed Zidan said in an MDA press release. Iran said the latest attack targeted “military objectives, defense industries, and command centers” in Israel, a spokesperson for the country's revolutionary guard said, according to state media. Speaking to CNN's Nic Robertson from the city in the aftermath of a fresh Iranian missile barrage, Mayor Yona Yahav confirmed that no one had been killed. According to Israeli emergency services, a total of 21 people were injured in Haifa during the attacks, including three with severe injuries. Yahav also said “I don't like wars,” after having personally experienced 10 of them, adding that the “name of the game is peace.” He said his culturally mixed city has been a mostly peaceful home to both Jews and Arabs for over 100 years. When asked about the talks that are being held in Geneva between Iran and European countries, Yahav said he hoped that a peace treaty would be the ultimate end result. The mayor said that the two-week deadline US President Donald Trump had given to decide US actions on Iran was “too much,” as he said it is difficult for residents to live while wrapped up in war. “A fixed answer I can't get from Trump, and this bothers me,” he said. In the midst of a conflict with Israel, Iranians still have extremely limited online access 48 hours after Iran imposed internet restrictions. Internet connectivity plummeted to just 3% on Wednesday afternoon and has remained low since then, according to data from Netblocks, a non-governmental organization monitoring internet governance. The blackout happened a day after Iran's Bank Sepah was hit with a cyberattack claimed by an Israel-linked hacking group, which took ATMs out of service. Iran has experienced partial internet outages since Israeli strikes began a week ago, with the number of people connected to the internet declining as residents evacuate major cities like Tehran, and businesses close. Talks are underway in Geneva between Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi and counterparts from France, Germany and Britain along with the EU's foreign policy chief. Ahead of the meeting, Britain's Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, said a “window now exists” to end the escalating crisis in the Middle East, a reference to US President Donald Trump's announcement that he would allow two weeks for diplomacy before deciding on whether to launch a US strike on Iran. At least 17 people were wounded in Israel on Friday after Iran launched a fresh missile salvo, according to health and emergency officials. At least three of those were seriously injured, including a 16-year-old boy, who was hit by shrapnel, local authorities said. CNN's Nic Robertson shows the aftermath of a strike on Haifa: Residents in the northern Israeli city of Haifa ran for cover in an underground parking lot below a shopping mall, a CNN team on the ground witnessed, amid a fresh Iranian missile attack on Friday. Citizens could be seen sheltering in the car park, with many of them on their phones to check for updates on the situation above ground. Iran fired a fresh barrage of missiles towards northern, central and southern Israel on Friday, according to the Israeli military. The strike wounded at least 17 people according to Israeli national emergency service MDA. Iranian missiles impacted several sites across Israel on Friday, according to fire and rescue teams, prompting bomb disposal teams to be despatched. Social media footage on Friday showed a large plume of smoke rising over buildings in Haifa. Iran fired a fresh barrage of missiles toward northern, central and southern Israel on Friday, according to the Israeli military. The military instructed residents to “enter a protected space and remain there until further notice.” Thousands of Iraqis took to the streets of Baghdad and other cities on Friday after powerful cleric Muqtada al-Sadr called for mass demonstrations against the conflict between Israel and Iran. Images released from al-Sadr's media office showed large crowds gathered in the Sadr City district of Iraq's capital, Baghdad, following Friday prayers. Many protesters could be seen holding umbrellas to shield themselves from the summer sun. One demonstrator in Baghdad, a 54-year-old taxi driver named Abu Hussein, told news agency AFP that Israel had “no right” to attack Iran. The Saudi nuclear regulator has warned that any attack on nuclear facilities intended for peaceful purposes is a violation of international law. Why this matters: Concern has been rising in Gulf Arab states about the possibility of environmental contamination or reprisal attacks if Israel or the United States strike Iran's nuclear facilities just across the Persian Gulf. Israel has not targeted it in its strikes at Iran's nuclear facilities. France, Germany and the United Kingdom are ready to make an offer to Iran for “complete negotiations,” French President Emmanuel Macron said just hours before a high-stakes diplomatic meeting gets underway in Switzerland. Macron warned there should be “no laxity” when it comes to managing the prospect of an “Iran endowed with nuclear arms,” speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a French defense show on Friday. Rubio, according to this diplomat, emphasized during call that the US is “ready for direct contact with the Iranians at any time.” Barrot and Rubio agreed to hold a follow up call on Friday to discuss the Geneva meeting and continue coordination, the diplomat said. Thousands of Iranians took to the streets of Tehran and other cities on Friday to protest against Israel, with many waving flags and chanting anti-Western slogans. Others waved flags from Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group — one of Iran's key regional allies. Footage from Iran's semi-official Tasnim News Agency showed protesters chanting anti-Israel and anti-British slogans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cybercriminals have breached insurance giant Aflac, potentially stealing Social Security numbers, insurance claims and health information, the company said Friday, the latest in a spree of hacks against the insurance industry. Erie Insurance and Philadelphia Insurance Companies have also reported hacks this month, which in those cases have caused widespread disruptions to IT systems used to serve customers. All three insurance-company hacks are consistent with the techniques of a young and rampant cybercrime group known as Scattered Spider, people familiar the investigation tell CNN. “This attack, like many insurance companies are currently experiencing, was caused by a sophisticated cybercrime group,” Aflac said in a statement on Friday, without naming Scattered Spider. It was too early to tell, the company said, how much customer information may have been stolen, but the potential exposure is vast. Aflac is one of the largest providers of supplemental health insurance in the US for medical expenses that aren't covered by a primary provider. It's a hallmark of Scattered Spider attackers, who are known to pose as tech support to infiltrate big corporations. The loose group of cybercriminals is considered dangerous and unpredictable, in part because it is believed to be comprised of youths in the US and the UK known for aggressively extorting their victims. Scattered Spider shot to infamy in September 2023 when they were linked to a pair of multimillion-dollar hacks on famous Las Vegas casinos and hotels MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. The hackers' tactics, and the way they target big swaths of American industries at a time, has cybersecurity executives pleading with companies to be wary of suspicious phone calls to their employees. Just last month, they were suspects in multiple cyberattacks on American retail companies. “If Scattered Spider is targeting your industry, get help immediately,” said Cynthia Kaiser, who until last month was deputy assistant director of the FBI's Cyber Division and oversaw FBI teams investigating the hackers. “They can execute their full attacks in hours. Scattered Spider often registers web domains that look very much like trusted help desks that companies use for IT support, the cybersecurity firm Halcyon, where Kaiser now works, says in a forthcoming report. While concerns about Iranian cyber capabilities are in the news because of the Israel-Iran war, “the threat I lose sleep over is Scattered Spider,” said John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google's Threat Intelligence Group. “They are already taking food off shelves and freezing businesses. The Iranian hackers may not even have Internet access, but these kids are in play right now.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses President Donald Trump weighing U.S. involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict. President Donald Trump has reported to the West Wing's Situation Room multiple times in recent days as the conflict in Iran comes to a rolling boil and the U.S. considers launching its own attacks on the Islamic Republic over mounting concerns it could produce a nuclear weapon in a short span of time. I can tell you this that Iran's got a lot of trouble, and they want to negotiate," Trump told reporters Wednesday on the U.S. potentially striking Iran as it continues trading deadly strikes with Israel. I said to people, why didn't you negotiate with me two weeks ago? Fox News Digital spoke to previous presidential administration officials — Fox News host and former Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who served under the first Trump administration, and former National Security Advisor under the first Trump administration John Bolton, who also served as ambassador to the U.N. under President George W. Bush's administration. "I often would sit there and think about the Osama bin Laden raid," McEnany told Fox News Digital in a phone interview Thursday morning. "This is where we saw our heroic Special Forces take out Osama bin Laden during the Obama administration. And I think we're at another point where similar decisions are being made, and even bigger decisions that may change the course of history are happening right now in that room." He is seen monitoring developments as U.S. Special Operations forces close in on ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's compound in Syria. Trump again held a meeting in the Situation Room Thursday morning, when he received an intelligence briefing with national security advisers, which followed a Situation Room meeting on Wednesday afternoon, another meeting on Tuesday afternoon with national security advisers and a Monday evening meeting upon his abrupt return from the G7 summit in Canada this week. Top national security officials, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, are among officials who have joined Trump in the meetings as the administration weighs the spiraling conflict. Bolton explained to Fox Digital in a Thursday morning phone interview that two types of top-level meetings are held in the Situation Room. The first is known as a "principals meeting," he said, which includes Cabinet secretaries, such as the secretary of state and secretary of defense, and is chaired by the national security advisor — a role currently filled by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. "The principals committee usually meets to try and get everything sorted out so that they know what decisions the president is going to be confronted with," Bolton said. Kayleigh McEnany, White House Press Secretary under the first Trump administration, speaks during a White House press briefing in 2020. "He chairs a full NSC meeting, and people review the information, update the situation, and the president can go back and forth with the advisors about asking questions, probing about the analysis, asking for more detail on something, kind of picking and choosing among the options, or suggesting new options," said Bolton, who served as Trump's national security advisor between April 2018 and September 2019. "And out of that could well come decisions," he added. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton speaks to reporters after a panel hosted by the National Council of Resistance of Iran on Aug. 17, 2022, in Washington. "A lot of critical decisions were made during the pandemic," she said. You go in, I think it's like 5,000 square feet, you're sitting there, there's clocks up from every country around the world, the different time zones. And you're just sitting there as critical decisions are made. "When he was in there, absolutely, there's a deference," she said, referring to how the tone of the room would change upon Trump's arrival. "Yet, you had key officials who spoke up, who were not afraid to give their point of view to him. But I think there's a recognition he's the commander in chief." Press secretaries typically do not attend high-profile National Security Council meetings in the Situation Room, but have security clearances and can call into the room if needed, and are given updates from senior officials. McEnany added that press secretaries wouldn't typically want to be in the room for high-stakes talks because "you don't want your head filled with these sensitive deliberations of classified information" when speaking with the media. Then-National Security Advisor John R. Bolton listens as President Donald Trump holds a meeting in the Oval Office in 2019. Bolton explained that for an issue such as Iran, the Situation Room meetings are likely restrictive and include top national security officials, such as the secretary of defense, director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "Sometimes it includes many more people, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Commerce Secretary, things like that," he said. The White House has also slashed NSC staffing since Trump took office, including after Rubio took the helm. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt held a press conference on Thursday — the first since Israel launched preemptive strikes on Iran June 12 — and said the next two weeks will be a critical time period as U.S. officials map out next steps. Then-President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and members of the national security team receive an update on the mission against Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room of the White House on May 1, 2011, in Washington. "I have a message directly from the president, and I quote: 'Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future. I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.' That's a quote directly from the president," she said Thursday. Israel launched pre-emptive strikes on Iran June 12 after months of attempted and stalled nuclear negotiations and subsequent heightened concern that Iran was advancing its nuclear program. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared soon afterward that the strikes were necessary to "roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival." He added that if Israel had not acted, "Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time." Dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," the strikes targeted Iran's nuclear and missile infrastructure and killed a handful of senior Iranian military leaders. Trump repeatedly has urged Iran to make a deal on its nuclear program, but the country pulled out of ongoing talks with the U.S. scheduled for Sunday in Oman. "Iran should have signed the ‘deal' I told them to sign," Trump posted to Truth Social Monday evening, when he abruptly left an ongoing G7 summit in Canada to better focus on the Israel–Iran conflict. "What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. Then-President Joe Biden meets with members of the National Security team regarding the unfolding missile attacks on Israel from Iran, on April 13, 2024, in the White House Situation Room in Washington. Leavitt added during Thursday's briefing that Trump is the "peacemaker-in-chief," while noting that he is also not one to shy from flexing America's strength. Again, he is a peacemaker in chief. And so, if there's a chance for diplomacy, the president's always going to grab it. But he's not afraid to use strength as well," she said. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for additional comment on the high-level talks but did not immediately receive a reply.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An appeals court on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump to keep control of National Guard troops he deployed to Los Angeles following protests over immigration raids. The decision halts a ruling from a lower court judge who found Trump acted illegally when he activated the soldiers over opposition from California Gov. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded it was likely Trump lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the Guard. It said that while presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's Guard, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for doing so and that Newsom had no power to veto the president's order. Gavin Newsom has worked its way through the courts, and, on Thursday, an appellate court ruled in the president's favor. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded it was likely Trump lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the guard. It said that while presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's guard, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for doing so, citing violent acts by protesters. “The federal government's interest in preventing incidents like these is significant.” Tanjam Jacobson, of Silver Spring, Md., holds a sign saying “Citizenship is a Birthright,” Thursday, May 15, 2025, outside the Supreme Court in Washington. “This is something that really matters,” says Jacobson, “it's so wrong against the constitution [to take away birthright citizenship].” (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The justices released six opinions on Friday on everything from California emission standards to a lawsuit filed by victims of terrorism attacks. That leaves 10 cases still to decide, including Trump's executive order denying birthright citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who are in the country illegally. The order has been blocked by lower courts. These nationwide court orders have emerged as an important check on Trump's efforts and a source of mounting frustration to the Republican president and his allies. ▶ Read more about what's left for the Supreme Court this term California National Guard and Marines hold back demonstrators at the Federal Building during a protest Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Los Angeles. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded that Trump can likely show that he lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the California National Guard — and that even if the federal government failed to notify the governor of California in advance as required by law, Newsom had no power to veto the president's order. Trump celebrated the decision on his Truth Social platform, calling it a “BIG WIN.” He wrote that “all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done.” ▶ Read more on developments following the appellate ruling Vance's office did not release a topic of discussion for his visit. The state sued for a temporary injunction to stop the deployment, but a federal appeals court ruled in Trump's favor Thursday night while that legal challenge continues. The evidence is MASSIVE,” Trump posted Friday on his social media site. This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! Trump has for years claimed, without evidence, that Democrat Joe Biden only won the 2020 election because of widespread voter fraud. Evidence presented in courts showed this didn't happen — judges, including some appointed by Trump, rejected nearly every claim of widespread fraud as false or frivolous. A special prosecutor in Biden's Justice Department investigated Trump's efforts to undermine the 2020 election, but that probe ended when Trump won back the White House in 2024. U.S. stocks are drifting higher following the Juneteenth holiday. Treasury yields also edged higher in the bond market after Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the U.S. military will get directly involved in Israel's fighting with Iran. Oil prices have been gyrating as fears rise and ebb that war could disrupt the global flow of crude. “The stock market's risk premium isn't just rising — it's recalibrating for a world where every macro lever now doubles as a tripwire,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management wrote in a commentary, adding that traders are bracing for what comes next. Trump's tariffs agenda may have been eclipsed by the conflict in the Middle East, but it remains another major factor weighing on markets, Innes said: “A delayed fuse is still a fuse.” Trump on Thursday signed an executive order to keep TikTok running in the U.S. for an additional 90 days, giving his administration more time to broker a deal that would bring the social media platform under American ownership. The first extension was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban — approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court — took effect. The second was in April when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump's tariff announcement. It is not clear how many times Trump can — or will — keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far there have been no legal challenges to fight them. We'll answer a few each day during our live coverage.</p>

The resulting film, “Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore” is an intimate look at her life: Growing up in a hearing family; winning the best actress Oscar at 21 for her first movie role in “Children of a Lesser God,” which film critic Rex Reed at the time called a “pity vote”; what she's described as an abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; getting sober; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors. It's also an evocative portal into the world of the deaf community that uses groundbreaking techniques and sound design to put American Sign Language (ASL) and visual communication first. Actor Marlee Matlin poses for a portrait to promote “Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore” on Wednesday, June 11, 2025, in New York. While Matlin told much of her story in the memoir “I'll Scream Later,” on some level it wasn't a completely satisfactory experience. Matlin and Stern spoke though translators to The Associated Press about the “CODA” effect, making the doc on their terms, and why they hope Reed sees this film. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity. STERN: I had never seen a deaf person direct an episode of TV or film. I thought, what does that even look like? I didn't realize until I took the job that really the whole form of documentary as we know it is really rooted in sound, in the assumption that people will be speaking and they can speak. I have to reframe a whole form of documentary. Director Shoshannah Stern poses for a portrait to promote “Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore” on Wednesday, June 11, 2025, in New York. We wouldn't do justice to Marlee's life if I had forced this form that really wasn't rooted in the way that she experienced this life. Scary for some people out there, but I never felt scared in making this documentary because she believed in me. MATLIN: If I had had a hearing director approach me to do this project, we could have done a very good job, but that person would not have seen me in the same way. They would not have the same lens as a deaf person. STERN: I did want to film with captions in mind, so I made sure that we did have a wider frame. We did this little surgery with words and syllables in one of the scenes where we mixed them all around to be able to bring people into how Marlee experiences conversations and the world. We wanted to make this documentary an immersive experience for the audience members, a sensory experience to help them understand. MATLIN: “CODA” certainly was a milestone and respected by so many people in the industry. It tackled a lot of things that both deaf and hearing people or audiences can identify with. That you can't just turn it off. Actor Marlee Matlin, left, and director Shoshannah Stern pose for a portrait to promote “Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore” on Wednesday, June 11, 2025, in New York. And I hoped that all the love we received and the three Academy Awards that we got would make a difference. It was honored on so many other levels too as well, whether we're talking about (director) Sian (Heder) or you're talking about Troy (Kotsur) or the SAG award which was just a dream come true, specifically of mine. We want to work in all levels of production. So “CODA” really elevated that conversation about how much we wanted to be part of the industry. But for some reason it didn't really break open the door as wide as I would have thought. We are working on our own levels to make changes. STERN: Marlee said something really brave when we were at Sundance. But I don't know if we have movement. MATLIN: There's so many stories that we can tell, so many stories that you can put up on screen, so many stories that we can put on stage. I go back to that comment about Rex Reed. I wonder if he would ever see this film. That's just one example of the things I'd like to see happen. But specifically, I am calling out Rex Reed. (Reed did not immediately return a request for comment.)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran‘s foreign minister said there is “no room” for negotiations with the United States so long as Israeli strikes continue. Ahead of talks with European officials in Geneva on Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said negotiations with the U.S. would not begin until Israel stopped its strikes. It is the Americans who are seeking negotiations; they have sent messages multiple times, including very serious ones. But we have explicitly told them that as long as the aggression and attacks continue, there is simply no room for talk of dialogue or diplomacy,” Araghchi said. Even now, if they have something to say, we are listening. We are not ashamed of defending the rights of the Iranian people, and we are not avoiding anyone.” In retaliation, Iran has hit Israel with missile and drone strikes, some of which have caused destruction. Iran has said its nuclear program is peaceful. Iran has said Israeli air strikes have killed 639 people, including top military officials, nuclear scientists, and hundreds of civilians. Israel has said at least two dozen civilians have died from Iranian strikes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aboard Air Force One late Monday night, having hastily left the G7 meeting in Canada, President Donald Trump took questions from reporters about the escalating Israel-Iran conflict. In the back and forth, Trump was asked about Tulsi Gabbard, his director of national intelligence, who testified to Congress in March that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon — a direct contradiction of Israel's claims that Iran was racing toward a bomb. “I don't care what she said,” Trump replied. “I think they were very close to having it.” Trump's terse rebuke of his top intelligence official set off a firestorm among the MAGA faithful on right-wing media, long divided over the issue of Iran. It also raised serious questions about Gabbard's standing in the administration. Just a month ago, White House officials insisted that the president not only liked Gabbard but enjoyed her company. Even as some in the administration believed that she was out of her depth, officials insisted that Trump and his team were giving Gabbard leeway to learn the ropes of her new job. But that tone has shifted, as multiple people inside the West Wing have grown disillusioned with Gabbard's performance, sources say. Trump's annoyance with Gabbard peaked earlier this month, this person said, when she posted a 3-minute video warning that the world is “closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before,” and blaming “political elite and warmongers” for stoking “fear and tensions between nuclear powers.” An ODNI official called the president and Gabbard's statements on Iran “congruent,” noting “just because Iran is not building a nuclear weapon right now, doesn't mean they aren't ‘very close' as President Trump said.” “This is just a lazy regurgitation of a fake news story that BOTH the White House and Vice President have already debunked,” Office of the Director of National Intelligence Press Secretary Olivia Coleman said in a statement. Related article Israel says Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon. Gabbard is among the newer members of Trump's orbit. A former Democratic congresswoman who forged common cause with the MAGA coalition in part because of its anti-interventionist posture, Gabbard was a frequent critic of Trump during his first term. Now, in near-weekly appearances on conservative cable news and in her regular social media feed, Gabbard exudes an image of the perfect MAGA warrior — physically fit, focused on weeding out “deep state” haters and absolutely loyal to Trump. But in the White House, some Trump officials have begun to question whether she has fully grasped what the job of DNI actually entails, with its oversight of the government's sprawling intelligence community, two administration officials told CNN. “It's an enormous job,” one administration official told CNN. Two days before she posted her nuclear war video, Gabbard was absent from a last-minute Camp David gathering of Trump's top national security officials to discuss Israel's plans to attack Iran. Among those present were Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Gabbard was on National Guard duty, according to an administration official, who said that the meeting had originally not been slated to address foreign policy. But one person familiar with the session said she wasn't invited because officials didn't feel her presence was required. An ODNI official said that Gabbard has been at every Situation Room meeting since the conflict between Israel and Iran began last week. Gabbard maintains allies in the White House, in particular Vice President JD Vance, who issued a statement Tuesday calling her “an essential member” of the team. When asked if Gabbard was in danger of getting fired, one senior White House official said that the president was hesitant to fire anyone, given the optics. “I think he's questioning her viewpoint as a value, especially after that video.” An ODNI official claimed to CNN that Gabbard has identified savings totaling approximately $150 million in contracts, including roughly $20 million by cutting diversity programs and roles. Past directors have struggled to define its role in the US government, and Trump officials have considered disbanding it entirely in both his first and second terms. Now, Gabbard has directed the document to be put together at ODNI, located a few miles down the beltway from CIA, as part of what an official said was a streamlining effort designed to get vital intelligence in Gabbard's hands faster. In a job that is explicitly supposed to be apolitical, Gabbard has been overt in her public focus on Trump's political objectives. Former DOD official Alex Plitsas joins Abby at the magic wall to talk through what he sees as three military options that President Trump is likely considering on Iran. Related video Three military possibilities for Iran that Trump is likely considering She's also fired top career officials she accused of leaking and participating in an office chat group devoted to trans support issues. Gabbard declassified documents about domestic terrorism in an effort to show the Biden administration targeted its political opponents, revoked security clearances for former intelligence officials critical of Trump, and made referrals to the Justice Department for criminal leak investigations. She also called for former FBI Director James Comey to be jailed after he posted an image of seashells that read “86 47” — a matter of domestic law enforcement, which the ODNI, as a foreign intelligence-focused organization, is not traditionally supposed to be involved in. Gabbard and her allies say she is working to restore trust in the US intelligence community by purging it of “rot” that she says “runs deep.” But inside the organization she leads, some career officials say Gabbard appears more focused on the image of leadership than actually leading. Like several others in the Trump administration, Gabbard has embraced an online persona that at times has more in common with a fitness influencer than the nation's spy chief. In one post in early May, she answered a comment from a follower who wanted to know what workout shoes she was wearing. There's also the sheer breadth of her media appearances. It's all made Gabbard somewhat of a Rorschach test: to her supporters, she's a MAGA warrior tackling entrenched corruption; to her opponents, she's a naive crusader, warping the ideal of apolitical intelligence in her zeal to support the president. In April, one of Gabbard's top advisers, Joe Kent, demanded that the NIC “update” an assessment that undercut the president's rationale for invoking the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations — an interference that former intelligence officials and Democratic members of Congress say was a disturbing example of a political leader inappropriately politicizing intelligence conclusions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Democrats can no longer paper over their party's core contradiction. Under Joe Biden in 2021, House Democrats passed legislation that would have established a monthly child allowance for most families, an expansion of Medicaid's elder care services, federal child care subsidies, universal prekindergarten, and a paid family leave program, among other new social benefits. But that bill failed — and then, so did Biden's presidency. There are two primary reasons why progressives' prospects for growing the welfare state have darkened. Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. To win a Senate majority in 2026, the party would need to win multiple states that Trump carried by double digits last year. To win the robust congressional majorities typically necessary for enacting large social programs, Democrats would likely need to transform their party's brand. Second, although Democrats developed grander ambitions for social spending over the past decade, they simultaneously grew more averse to raising taxes on anyone but the super-rich. But Biden-era inflation revealed the limits of this strategy. And if Congress passes President Donald Trump's tax cut plan, then interest rates and inflationary risk are likely to remain elevated for years, while the cost of servicing America's debts will soar. Liberals could respond to all this by paring back their ambitions for the welfare state, while seeking to advance progressive goals through regulatory policy. It is perhaps not a coincidence that the two most prominent policy movements in Democratic circles today — the anti-monopoly and “abundance” crusades — are both principally concerned with reforms that require no new tax revenue (antitrust enforcement in the former case, zoning liberalization in the latter). But expanding America's safety net remains a moral imperative. In the latter primary, even the Democrats' most moderate contender — Joe Biden — vowed to establish a public option for health insurance and tuition-free community colleges, among other social programs. Biden's agenda only grew more ambitious upon taking office. No president since Lyndon B. Johnson had proposed a more sweeping expansion of social welfare than the Build Back Better Act. And yet, while Democrats' aspirations for social spending had become historically bold, the party's position on taxes had grown exceptionally timid. In 2016, Hillary Clinton had promised not to raise taxes on any American family earning less than $250,000. Four years later, Biden vowed to spare all households earning less than $400,000 – despite the fact that tax rates on upper middle-class families had fallen during Trump's first term. Meanwhile, the Democrats' congressional leadership was actually pushing to cut taxes on rich blue state homeowners by increasing the state and local income tax deduction. In other words: In 2021, Democrats were promising to establish an unprecedentedly large welfare state, while keeping taxes on 98 percent of households historically low. In reality, though, Biden's vision was also premised on the assumption that America could deficit-finance new spending with little risk of sparking inflation or high interest rates. Instead, Democrats leaned on budget gimmicks to “pay for” its agenda: Although the party intended the law's new programs to be permanent, it scheduled many of them to expire after just a few years, so as to make the policies look cheaper over a decade-long budget window. Even as written, the law would have increased deficits by $749 billion in its first five years. More fundamentally, Biden's basic fiscal objective — to establish wide-ranging social benefits through taxes on the super rich alone — only made sense in a world of low inflation. Western Europe's robust welfare states are all funded through broad-based taxation. This is partly because administering a large safety net requires managing economic demand. When the government expands its provision of elder care, social housing, child care, and pre-K, it increases overall demand for workers and resources in the economy. And if the supply of labor and materials doesn't rise in line with this new demand, then inflation can ensue. Taxes effectively “pay for” new spending by freeing up such resources. When households see their post-tax income decline, they're often forced to make fewer discretionary purchases. Raise taxes on an upper middle-class family and it might need to postpone its dreams of a lake house. That in turn frees up labor for public programs: The fewer construction workers needed to build vacation homes, the more that will be available to build affordable housing. Even if you increase Elon Musk's tax rate by 50 percent, he won't actually need to reduce his consumption at all — the billionaire will still have more money than he can spend in a lifetime. And if they do not curb their consumption in response to a tax hike, then that tax hike will not actually free up resources. In 2021, Democrats felt no obligation to sweat these details. For nearly a decade after the Great Recession, economic demand had been too low. Workers and materials had stood idle on the economy's sidelines, as there wasn't enough spending to catalyze their employment. In that context, unfunded welfare benefits can boost growth without generating inflation. But as Democrats moved Build Back Better through Congress, the macroeconomic terrain shifted beneath their feet. Biden likely would have struggled to get his social agenda through the Senate (where Democrats held only 50 votes) even in the absence of 2022's inflation. But that surge in prices all but guaranteed the legislation's defeat: Suddenly, it became clear that the government could not increase economic demand without pushing up inflation and interest rates. America had returned to a world of fiscal constraints. Unfortunately, those constraints could prove lasting, especially if Donald Trump's tax agenda makes it into law. Thus, the next Democratic government probably won't have much freedom to deficit spend without increasing Americans' borrowing costs or bills. Meanwhile, if that administration holds power after 2032, it will also need to find a ton of new revenue, just to maintain America's existing welfare state. But in 2033, that fund will likely be exhausted, according to government projections. At that point, the government will need to find upward of $414.5 billion in new revenue, each year, to maintain existing Social Security benefits without increasing the deficit. Indeed, merely sustaining Americans' existing retirement benefits would almost certainly require raising taxes on households earning less than $400,000. Maintaining such benefits while also creating new welfare programs — in a context of structurally high deficits and interest rates — would plausibly entail large, broad-based tax increases, the likes of which today's Democrats scarcely dare to contemplate. To be sure, it is possible that technological progress could render this entire analysis obsolete. Some analysts expect artificial intelligence to radically increase productivity over the next decade, while devaluing white-collar labor. This could slow the pace of wage and price growth, while turbo-charging income inequality. In a world where robots can instantly perform work that presently requires millions of humans, America could plausibly finance a vast social welfare state solely through taxes on capital. But until AI actually yields a discernible leap in productivity, I don't think it is safe to take an impending robo-utopia as a given. Democrats probably can't escape the tension between their commitments on taxation and social spending. But they can seek to mitigate it in a few different ways. One is to scale down the party's ambitions for the welfare state, while seeking to advance progressive economic goals through other means. The party's fear of raising taxes is not baseless. In a 2021 Gallup poll, only 19 percent of Americans said they would like to have more government services in exchange for higher taxes, while 50 percent said they'd prefer lower taxes in exchange for fewer services. Meanwhile, Democrats have grown increasingly reliant on the support of upper middle-class voters. In this political environment, calling for large middle-class tax hikes could well ensure perpetual Republican rule. In the short term then, Democrats might therefore be wise to narrow their agenda for social welfare, focusing on modest programs that can be funded exclusively with taxes on the rich. You don't need to raise middle-class taxes to expand collective bargaining rights, guarantee worker representation on corporate boards, or raise the minimum wage. (Of course, achieving any of these goals federally would require Democrats to win a robust Senate majority — one sufficiently large and progressive enough to abolish the legislative filibuster, which currently establishes a 60-vote threshold for enacting new, non-budgetary legislation.) America lets more of its children suffer poverty — and more of its adults go without health insurance — than similarly rich countries. These deprivations are largely attributable to our nation's comparatively threadbare safety net. And they can only be fully eliminated through redistributive policy. A higher minimum wage will not ensure that children with unemployed parents never go hungry, or that every worker with cancer can afford treatment. And as the population ages, increasing investment in eldercare will be increasingly imperative. But absent an AI-induced productivity revolution, building a holistic welfare state will require persuading the middle-class to accept higher taxes. But part of the solution is surely to demonstrate that Democratic governments can spend taxpayer funds efficiently and effectively. Better then not to begin the journey toward it by taking several steps backward. Francis Collins led the NIH for a decade before its dismantling. Trump derided “kooky Tucker Carlson” — the leading right-wing voice opposing involvement in Israel's Iran war.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Los Angeles Dodgers and the federal government are at odds over what happened on Thursday when federal agents were on or near Dodger Stadium grounds. Tonight's game will be played as scheduled,” the team said in a post on X. But not long after that post, the Department of Homeland Security stated that the agents who were at Dodger Stadium were not from ICE and their presence wasn't related to the immigration crackdown that has roiled Los Angeles. US Customs and Border Protection vehicles were in a nearby parking lot on or near the grounds, and one of them had a car malfunction that caused them to stay longer, according to a CBP official who maintained there were no operations related to the MLB club. The Department of Homeland Security surged agency personnel to the region, including border agents, to respond to those protests and many have remained in the area. “This had nothing to do with the Dodgers. CBP vehicles were in the stadium parking lot very briefly, unrelated to any operation or enforcement,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. It's unknown exactly what parking lot the federal agents were in when the vehicle had its malfunction – there are huge swaths of parking lots within stadium property and some parking lots outside that are used for overflow and stadium employees when the grounds are filled. Video shown by affiliate KABC showed federal agents stationed on one of the streets leading up to the stadium. CNN has reached out to ICE for comment. The team lost 5-3 to the San Diego Padres in Los Angeles on Thursday and staged a celebrity softball game, hosted by star player Mookie Betts, in celebration of Black Heritage Night. The Dodgers are averaging more than 50,000 fans in attendance per home game this season, the only team in the majors bringing in that many fans per game. Thursday's home game was an especially hot ticket as the two teams are heated rivals in the National League West Division. The federal agents' action comes days after singer Nezza, whose full name is Vanessa Hernández, performed the US National Anthem in Spanish on Saturday. She said she was first planning on singing the Anthem in Spanglish, but with the ongoing immigration raids, she decided to do the song in Spanish only. She says a team employee told her not to. That didn't deter her, and she performed the song in Spanish anyway. Her performance took place the same day that demonstrators filled streets across the country for the “No Kings” protest and as frustrations in Los Angeles continued because of ICE raids that took place within the past few weeks. While the team hasn't outwardly spoken on the ongoing frustrations of the ongoing immigration crackdowns ICE raids that have been happening in the city, star player Dodgers player Kike Hernández, a native of Puerto Rico, showed his support for Los Angeles in an Instagram post. “I am saddened and infuriated by what's happening in our country and our city,” Hernández said in part. And I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart,” he said, adding, “ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.” CNN's Sara Smart contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But it's proving to be an uphill battle with Senate Republicans. Some GOP senators don't want to claw back funds for certain programs, including $1.1 billion to public broadcasting and $900 million in foreign aid for global health, despite a party-wide search for cost-cutting measures across the federal government. The DOGE-inspired $9.4 billion rescissions legislation that House Republicans passed last week accounts for but a sliver of Trump's $4 trillion “big, beautiful” tax and spending proposal to advance his domestic agenda. But the desire for Congress to sign off on budget cuts that he's made by executive orders is compounding what are already fraught policy negotiations among both GOP-led chambers and the White House. “We'll all make up our own minds,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) said recently, reflecting on those urging the Senate to rubberstamp the House. New rescissions can't be added through amendments, but it's likely senators will seek to strike certain items or minimize spending reductions during a marathon amendment process in the lead-up to a final floor vote. It will need to pass before the bill hits a July 18 expiration date. White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought will testify next week before the Senate Appropriations Committee about the president's rescissions request. “Passing President Trump's Rescissions Package is a MUST DO,” Schmitt posted Thursday. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) is among the more centrist Republicans with concerns over cutting global health funds. Notably, she'll also lead next week's hearing with Vought as chairwoman of Senate Appropriations. Those include the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, to fight global aids under the all-but-defunct U.S. Agency for International Development. The bill would claw back $400 million of the $6 billion appropriated by Congress this fiscal year for a program credited with saving millions of lives around the world since its inception under former President George W. Bush. Rounds and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), another centrist, have expressed similar anxieties. Cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, total $1.1 billion. But it's facing checkered resistance from several members across the ideological spectrum of Senate Republicans, including Collins. Those who represent states with sprawling rural populations, such as Rounds and Murkowski, are particularly concerned about severing constituents from a medium that they say many rely upon for communication and information. Public radio is often the “only communications” for rural Native American reservations, according to Rounds.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Wattenberg died 10 years ago this month, but his legacy still looms large. They just as steadfastly refused to listen, with the ramifications still being felt today. Wattenberg's career was built on the mastery of data. Long before Google, he immersed himself in facts and figures, poring over government reports and academic journals to understand the latest statistics on policy matters. He knew crime rates, birth rates, and welfare trends in an age when there was no internet to provide an answer via a few keyboard strokes. He then used that data to explain, inform, predict, and entertain. The resulting book, This USA, written with former head of the Census Bureau Richard Scammon, led to Wattenberg's appointment as a White House speechwriter for President Lyndon Johnson. This insight reportedly inspired President Richard Nixon's notion of the “Silent Majority” and has remained an important element in American politics to this day. Wattenberg continued to influence presidents, earning the moniker of “Ronald Reagan's favorite Democrat” in the 1980s and receiving a much-discussed, almost hourlong phone call from President Bill Clinton in reaction to Wattenberg's 1996 book, Values Matter Most. In The Birth Dearth, he argued that contrary to conventional wisdom, underpopulation rather than overpopulation threatened the prosperity and political influence of Western nations. This belief made him an unabashed supporter of legal immigration. Wattenberg called his approach to punditry “data journalism.” To master the numbers, he developed relationships with experts in shops all over town. His Rolodex — yes, he had one — was filled with names like Stephanie Ventura of the National Center for Health Statistics, Carl Haub of the Population Reference Bureau, and Dallas Salisbury of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. These nonfamous but data-deep experts would walk him through their latest reports and help him identify vital trends and revealing developments. He used data to bring home America's bright future — and consistently advised that the more optimistic presidential candidate would win elections. It remains good guidance for those seeking political office. He had a plainspoken way of expressing himself that led his friend and colleague Jeane Kirkpatrick to observe, “Ben writes in ‘American. '” To Wattenberg, this was an enormous compliment, as a love of America infused his writings. Wattenberg's indefatigable belief in America contributed to his sense of foreboding about the Democrats' leftward drift. He started his career in Washington as an LBJ speechwriter, recalling that Johnson would assign him campaign speeches because, Wattenberg wrote, Johnson knew “I really hated Republicans.” But his hatred of the Republicans softened during decades of laments that the party of his youth had left him behind. Wattenberg had clear and what he saw as obvious advice for the Democrats. Wattenberg's decades-old observations on the Democrats' leftward drift read like they could be written today. Exactly the opposite: They have no money, organization or unity because they are in trouble.” In 1984, shortly after Reagan crushed Walter Mondale to win reelection, Wattenberg was dismissive of the excuses liberal Democrats would use to explain their defeat: “Accidents, tricks, personal popularity. He tried to offer the Democrats a way out: Democrats “will serve their country and their party better if they acknowledge that their real problem — which is the issues they have come to represent — than they will by trumpeting a phony one, that television did them in. If Reagan said government was so very bad, and Reagan was such a silly fellow, then Democrats must therefore say government is so very good. Wattenberg's imprint on our politics extends beyond his writings. Among his many skills, Wattenberg had a keen eye for talent. He mentored people who reflect his approach today, including the pundit Jonah Goldberg, polling expert Karlyn Bowman, New York Times reporter Mark Mazzetti, and former White House domestic policy adviser and author Karl Zinsmeister. Wattenberg's talent-spotting was not unlike his trend-spotting: He had an ability to look at a sea of ordinary people, or numbers, and spot the extraordinary within them. For all who knew him personally, he is still missed — and for frustrated Democrats, he remains a voice who foresaw why Democrats are out of power in Washington today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Thursday that Trump would not commemorate Juneteenth, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States, and was established as a federal holiday by former President Joe Biden in 2021. Soon we'll end up having a holiday for every once working day of the year. It must change if we are going to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” “I'm not tracking his signature on a proclamation today,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday of Trump. Trump said in 2021 that he made Juneteenth “very famous.” “On June 19, 1865, Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, to proclaim the end of slavery, delivering on the promise of President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation,” he wrote. 160 years later, this day serves as a clear reminder that unity and liberty are at the core of what it means to be American.” Biden celebrated the holiday in Galveston, Texas, at Reedy Chapel AME Church. Trump has not said he would end Juneteenth as a holiday, though he has slammed diversity initiatives within the federal government and elsewhere. Earlier this year, Trump said he plans to add holidays celebrating the end of World War I and World War II on May 8 and Nov. 11, respectively. He also said then that there are too many holidays. “We will not be closing the Country for these two very important Holidays, November 11 and May 8, World War I and World War II, because we already have too many Holidays in America,” he wrote. “There are not enough days left in the year.</p>
