                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats recently ousted David Hogg from leadership after he criticized the party for complacency. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. New polling finds that most Democratic voters want the current leaders of the Democratic Party to be replaced, as current leadership has failed to unite behind a coherent message to resist President Donald Trump's fascist power grab. A plurality of respondents, at 49 percent, said that they're unsatisfied with current leaders. The survey included over 4,200 respondents, including 1,293 Democrats, and was conducted earlier this month. After Democrats suffered enormous losses in the 2024 election, many conservative and mainstream liberal analysts had pushed a false narrative that Democrats lost because they hadn't gone far enough to the right and embraced more of Republicans' outright fascist viewpoints. Indeed, the Reuters/Ipsos polling suggested that Democrats want party leaders to go further left on a wide variety of economic and social issues. For instance, roughly 4 in 5 Democrats or more said that they want the party to prioritize universal health care, affordable child care, and raising taxes on the rich. A smaller majority of respondents said that the party actually prioritizes such issues. But in reality, the majority of federally elected Democrats actually oppose proposals like Medicare for All, and many party leaders have actively worked to sabotage support for such ideas. Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-Vermont) Medicare for All bill introduced this year, for instance, only had 15 cosponsors out of 47 Democrats in the caucus — Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (New York) not being one of them. Far from taxing the rich, party leaders have also cozied up to billionaires — with some in the party recently suggesting that Democrats should court Elon Musk, friend of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, during his public breakup with President Donald Trump this month. Schumer and other leaders like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have faced intense scrutiny in recent months in particular, with both leaders having been effectively absent as the Trump administration has escalated its violent and authoritarian tactics both domestically and worldwide. For instance, opposing war with Iran could be a major boon for Democrats, as the prospect is extremely unpopular among Americans, recent polls have found, who strongly favor diplomatic options. Figures like Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, meanwhile, have been totally silent; Harris, after all, named Iran as the U.S.'s top enemy on the campaign trail last year. “Our generation grew up going through two multi trillion dollar wars we should have never been involved in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It may also have inspired one driver who got stuck trying to travel down the Spanish Steps in Rome this week. But it is not only in Rome where steps, or indeed navigational issues, can create havoc for drivers. In the slightly less celebrated surrounds of north London's Maitland Park estate, residents have been complaining about drivers getting their cars stuck trying to rehash one of the film's most famous scenes by driving down a small flight of steps. One resident, Aron Kennedy, posted online about the phenomenon, which he referred to as a “new Camden tourist attraction along with Karl Marx”. He told the paper: “If it happens one more time I think we might have to get a living statue of a car stuck there permanently.” All because the satnav had reportedly said to turn left at Tesco. And so many lorries have got stuck following their satnavs down a narrow country lane in Cornwall that one man reportedly paid £150 for a large yellow sign that read, in block capitals: “Do not follow satnav. In Somerset, by a 6ft-wide lane, stands a house that has reportedly sustained £50,000 of damage over several years from HGV drivers trying to force their way past while following directions on their devices. And those are just domestic tales of driving woe. Guardian readers have been sharing some of their own experiences. Otieno Okatch said he and his wife, from California, rented a car in Switzerland during the annual Fasnacht celebrations. “One day, we ended up in downtown Lucerne and got lost. A police escort had to help us get out as thousands stared at the two foreigners.” Anand Ranganathan, also from California, told of an experience when he and his wife were in Arles, France, while touring the country about 14 years ago. Forced by hefty mobile roaming charges to follow printed-out Google Maps directions to their hotel, they were sent down a “one-lane road that had a retractable bollard in the middle of it”. He said: “Only drivers who had a special code were allowed to go through it … Of course, we didn't realise this until we got close to the bollard.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court on Friday revived a lawsuit from fuel producers challenging California's strict vehicle emission rules, allowing the companies to fight an on-again, off-again climate policy that President Donald Trump has previously opposed. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a 7-2 majority. Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. “The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” Kavanaugh wrote. While the federal government generally sets vehicle emission standards, the Environmental Protection Agency has at times granted a waiver to California – because of its longstanding air-quality problems – to set tougher standards. Given the state's size, automakers have long hewed to its tighter emissions controls even for cars sold in other states. That waiver was challenged by Diamond Alternative Energy, a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation, and several other companies and groups that advocate on behalf of fuel manufacturers. A federal appeals court in Washington, DC, concluded that market forces are driving the national push toward electric vehicles far more than California's tough regulations. California said that even if courts eliminate the waiver, it wouldn't help the fuel producers because consumer demand was motivating people to buy electric vehicles on their own. During oral arguments, both conservative and liberal justices seemed to be skeptical of that position, noting that the EPA had pointed to a reduced reliance on fossil fuels as part of the justification for the waiver. Related article Supreme Court allows victims of terrorist attacks to sue the Palestinian Authority Perhaps sensing a win in their case, the fuel producers advocated for a categorical rule that would have made it easier for companies challenging the federal government to sue over similar decisions in the future. It's not clear how much practical impact the court's decision will have. Trump seems almost certain to withdraw the waiver, just as he did during his first administration. The waiver was later reinstated by President Joe Biden. “President Trump rescinded this exact same waiver the last time he was in office,” Jackson wrote. “Because a withdrawal of the waiver would moot this case, an obvious question arises: Why would this court rush to opine on whether the fuel industry's legal challenge” can proceed “when all involved – including petitioners themselves – believe that any such ‘case' or ‘controversy' will soon vanish?” “Congress intended for California to be able to regulate emissions from new vehicles sold in our state, and we remain firmly committed to advancing and implementing strong standards that safeguard public health and reduce climate pollution,” he said. Last year, the court upended a Biden administration effort to reduce smog and air pollution wafting across state lines.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: This story was updated with comments from Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. Russian President Vladimir Putin said "all of Ukraine" belonged to Russia in a speech on June 20 at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, amid increasingly aggressive official statements about Moscow's final territorial ambitions in Ukraine. Putin's claim was based on the false narrative often pushed both by himself as leader and by Russian propaganda that Russians and Ukrainians are "one people." In response to the speech in St Petersburg, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha condemned Putin's comments as "cynical," saying it showed “complete disregard for U.S. peace efforts." "Wherever the foot of a Russian soldier steps is Russian land," Putin said, directly implying Russia's intention to continue occupying more than just the five Ukrainian regions that Moscow has illegally laid claim to: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, as well as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Sybiha said that "Russian soldier's foot" brings only "death, destruction, and devastation." "And, while Putin is busy sending Russian feet to invade other countries, he is bringing Russians inside the country to their knees economically." Asked whether Russia aimed to seize the regional center of Sumy in Ukraine's northeast, Putin said that while such a mission has not been assigned, he wouldn't rule it out. Russian troops have moved 10-12 kilometers (6-8 miles) deep into the region, according to Putin. Sybiha urged the West to ramp up military aid to Ukraine, tighten sanctions against Russia, designate Moscow a terrorist state, and "isolate it fully." "His cynical statements serve only one purpose: to divert public attention away from the complete failure of his quarter-century rule," the minister added. Since March, Russia has reportedly taken control of about 200 square kilometers (80 square miles) in northern Sumy Oblast, including roughly a dozen small villages, according to open-source conflict mapping projects. As of May 31, mandatory evacuations had been ordered for 213 settlements. In May, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to create a so-called "security buffer zone" along the border with Ukraine, while Zelensky said on May 28 that Moscow had massed 50,000 troops near Sumy. In a separate interview with Bild on June 12, Zelensky dismissed Moscow's claims of significant territorial gains as "a Russian narrative" aimed at shaping global perceptions. He stressed that Ukrainian forces have managed to hold off a renewed offensive for nearly three weeks. Projecting a winning position on the battlefield and gaining confidence from Trump's frequent anti-Ukrainian rhetoric and refusal to approve further military aid to Kyiv, Moscow has stuck to maximalist demands, refusing the joint U.S.-Ukraine proposal of a 30-day unconditional ceasefire along the front line. On June 18, in an interview to CNN, Russian ambassador to the U.K. Andrei Kelin said that while Russian forces were advancing on the battlefield and taking more Ukrainian, there was no incentive to stop, and that Kyiv must either accept Moscow's peace terms now or "surrender" after losing much more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One expert has warned that attacks on nuclear facilities “should never take place” because of the radioactive fallout. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. The Pentagon has reportedly assessed that the only weapon that could destroy a nuclear facility in Iran deemed by war hawks to be a key part of Iran's nuclear program is a nuclear bomb — an intensely ironic finding in a war fought over the pretense of stopping nuclear proliferation. According to U.S. sources cited by The Guardian, defense officials have been told that only a “tactical nuclear weapon” could penetrate deep enough underground to destroy Fordow, a nuclear facility reportedly built inside a mountain in northwestern Iran. Officials have been discussing using GBU-57s, which are 30,000-pound bombs, to penetrate the facility. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump has said that he will decide within the next two weeks whether he will instruct the military to strike Iran. President Donald Trump is not considering using a nuclear weapon, The Guardian reported on Wednesday, and it has not been presented as a possibility by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth or by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine. At the same time, however, direct attacks on Iran by the U.S. would likely only push Iranian officials into developing a nuclear weapon, rather than deterring them. It is a somewhat common sense conclusion that Iran would want to intensify its war capabilities if it's facing an assault by two of the most powerful militaries on earth. “Senior U.S. intelligence officials said that Iranian leaders were likely to shift toward producing a bomb if the American military attacked the Iranian uranium enrichment site Fordo or if Israel killed Iran's supreme leader,” the Times reported on Thursday. Over the years, U.S. aggression against non-nuclear powers has incentivized targeted nations to go nuclear. The publication also said that the fact that numerous groups and officials have assessed that Iran is not actively working toward a nuclear weapon is “irrelevant” to some American and Israeli officials — despite Israel's entire stated pretense for the war. Indeed, on Tuesday, Trump said “I don't care” that the U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Iran isn't building a nuclear weapon, according to his own top intelligence official.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House announces US president has shortened trip to meet world leaders Donald Trump will spend as little time as possible on European soil next week when he heads to a crucial Nato summit for just 24 hours. A week after he left a meeting of the G7 in Canada early, apparently irritated at having to sit through a meeting on wildfires when his mind was on the Middle East, it will raise fears among allies that he has no time for the sorts of summits that underpin international diplomacy. Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said the shortened trip was not a snub, but a reflection of how Nato has tightened the schedule. His new schedule means he will still arrive in time for a leaders' dinner and will attend a session devoted to discussing allies' efforts to spend the equivalent of five percent of their gross domestic product on defence. “He wants to see that happen,” said Ms Leavitt. The president upended this week's G7 summit in Kananaski, Canada, hurrying home on Monday night to deal with the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. He was asked about the chances of reaching a deal with Iran and said: “As soon as we leave here we are going to do something. With the Middle East in flames, he then had to sit through a session on tackling wildfires. I think you can see the timeline of a wildfire meeting followed by the announcement that he was leaving and draw your own conclusions.” Nato had already accounted for Mr Trump's mercurial nature, condensing its format from three sessions to a single two-and-a-half-hour meeting. Ms Leavitt said the president's travel plans simply reflected that shift. Organisers have shortened the summit and drafted an abbreviated joint statement in part to avoid a repeat of Mr Trump's last Nato meeting. In 2019, he left early, abandoning a planned press conference after other leaders were caught on camera joking about him. Brett Bruen, a former Obama official and president of the Global Situation Room, said the shortened trips were “becoming a pattern.” He said: “If we are no longer to use summits for substance then I think it begs the question: Where else are leaders getting together?”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge in Rhode Island blocked the Trump administration from using states' cooperation with immigration efforts as a condition for receiving transportation funds. US District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction to 20 mostly Democratic-led states that filed a lawsuit last month to prevent the Department of Transportation from cutting off billions of dollars in funding if the states refused to comply with federal immigration enforcement. In his Thursday ruling, McConnell, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, said, “Congress did not authorize or grant authority to the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars specifically appropriated for transportation purposes.” Many state attorneys general have sued over issues ranging from the president's bid to end birthright citizenship to his tariff policies. The president has used federal funding as leverage amid policy disagreements with different states and organizations. He threatened to withhold funds from California over a transgender athlete's participation in a sporting event and to cut off $3 billion in federal grant funding for Harvard University over its handling of anti-Israel protests. But, no surprise, an Obama-appointed judge has ruled that states can openly defy our federal immigration laws. This is judicial activism pure & simple and I will continue to fight in the courts,” Duffy wrote. Earlier this week, Duffy wrote in a social media post that the department “will NOT fund rogue state actors who refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.” California's Attorney General Rob Bonta praised the court's decision and criticized Trump for using funds “as a bargaining chip.” I'm glad to see the District Court agrees, blocking the President's latest attempt to circumvent the Constitution and coerce state and local governments into doing his bidding while we continue to make our case in court,” Bonta said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senator from Massachusetts questions state department's redirection of $500m to troubled organization Elizabeth Warren has confronted the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, over reports that the state department is considering redirecting $500m from USAID to the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). In a letter addressed to Rubio and USAID's acting administrator, Kenneth Jackson, the Massachusetts senator argued that the GHF, a self-proclaimed aid organisation that is backed by the Israeli and US governments, “marks an alarming departure from the professional humanitarian organizations that have worked on the ground, in Gaza and elsewhere, for decades”. “The questions surrounding GHF – its funding sources and connection to the Trump Administration, its use of private contractors, its ability to serve and be seen as a neutral entity, its abandonment by its founders, and its basic competence in providing aid – must be answered before the State Department commits any funding to the organization,” Warren wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided exclusively to the Guardian. BCG canceled its cooperation with the GHF after the organisation was embroiled in controversy following a series of shootings by Israeli forces at its food distribution sites. Reuters first reported that funds directed to USAID, which is being rolled into the state department, could be rerouted to the GHF in an important boost to a troubled organisation that opened food distribution centres in Gaza last month. The GHF has struggled to partner with major aid organisations, even as Israeli and US officials have put pressure on NGOs to route their humanitarian through the GHF or face having no access to Gaza at all. Major aid organisations have boycotted the GHF, which was forced to temporarily close some of its food distribution centres shortly after its launch last month due to security concerns. Israeli forces have opened fired into crowds near the food distribution sites several times in mass casualty events that Israeli officials have said took place in self-defence. Critics have argued that the GHF is a tool for the Israeli and US governments to politicise humanitarian aid and to distribute it in ways that will depopulate sectors of Gaza in apparent violation of international law.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At total of 30 people were killed and 172 others injured after a mass Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported on June 18 that search and rescue operations in the Solomianskyi district lasted more than 39 hours, involving over 400 State Emergency Service rescuers and 200 pieces of equipment. Initial data from Ukraine's National Police cited 15 dead and 124 injured, but the death toll was revised several times — first down to 10, then up to 16 by the State Emergency Service. Early on June 18, more victims were found under the rubble of one residential building, raising the number of fatalities to 23. President Volodymyr Zelensky updated the death toll once more in his evening address on June 19, announcing a total of 30 dead and 172 injured. The almost nine-hour-long strike saw Moscow's forces launch large numbers of kamikaze attack drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles at Ukraine's capital. The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that Russia launched 472 aerial weapons overnight, including nearly 280 Shahed-type attack drones and two Kinzhal ballistic missiles. Air defenses also intercepted one Kinzhal missile, while another was reportedly lost from radar tracking. President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault "one of the most horrifying attacks on Kyiv," saying more than 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched across Ukraine overnight. "Such attacks are pure terrorism," he said in a statement on social media. Zelensky confirmed that damage had been reported in eight districts of Kyiv, with emergency workers still searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment block. In a video posted on Telegram, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said cluster munitions had been found in one area of the city. He later added that June 18 would be an official day of mourning in Kyiv. Many of the deaths and injuries occurred when a Russian missile hit a nine-storey residential building in the Solomianskyi district, "completely destroying" one section, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. "I saw the missile because it was low," Olena Kushnirova, a 46-year-old  nurse who lives in a neighboring building to the one that was hit, told the Kyiv Independent. "I grabbed my daughter by the hand and shouted 'run!' We ran to the toilet, and then there was a very powerful explosion." Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned the attack, calling it a "massive and brutal strike" timed deliberately to coincide with the G7 summit. He sends a signal of total disrespect to the United States and other partners who have called for an end to the killing," Sybiha said. "Only strong steps and real pressure on Moscow can prove him wrong." "People started running outside, shouting, some in panic, because the attack wasn't over yet. Drones struck the institute's 10th floor and broke windows on three other floors. At least one woman was injured and multiple homes were damaged, according to the regional administration. The company announced it was forced to cancel all current orders and suspend new ones indefinitely following the destruction of its Kyiv site. Russian forces also hit a Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) freight train carrying grain. Several railcars overturned, temporarily halting operations and spilling grain from the damaged wagons. Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national postal service, reported the destruction of two of its branches in Kyiv during the attack, according to CEO Ihor Smiliansky. The company's team is working to "quickly restore services," he said. The attack followed a series of drone strikes overnight on June 16 targeting Kyiv Oblast, including both the capital and surrounding settlements. In the Obukhiv district, a 60-year-old man was injured, according to regional authorities. Russian attacks against Ukraine have intensified in May and June, with Moscow launching several record-breaking mass strikes against Kyiv and other cities.</p>

TEL AVIV, June 20. /TASS/. Israel detected missile launches from Iran and issued an air-raid alert in many parts of the country.

According to a TASS reporter, sirens went off in areas including near Tel Aviv, and at least one loud explosion was heard during the attack.

According to the Ynet news website, the alert was issued at the same time in many parts of the Israel: from the north to the very south, including the Eilat area on the Red Sea coast.

According to Israel's Channel 12 television, this time around Iran launched about 25 missiles, according to preliminary data.

The National Ambulance Service said at least two people suffered injuries, with one of them in serious condition and the other in moderate condition.

The military has not yet commented on the aftermath of the attack, but canceled the air-raid alert and allowed people to leave shelters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. He served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 2010 to 2024. The main entrance of NATO headquarters in Brussels is flanked by two somber memorials that serve as reminders of why we need the alliance. These monuments underscore how and why North America and Europe have stood strong together in this alliance for more than seven decades. As NATO's members face an increasingly dangerous world, it is our task to make the alliance stronger, fair, and more lethal so that it continues to keep adversaries at bay. Russia has brought war back to Europe and has teamed up with China, North Korea, and Iran to reshape the global order. Russia is reconstituting its forces with Chinese technology and producing weapons faster than we thought it could. This year alone, Russia is expected to roll out 1,500 tanks, 3,000 armored vehicles, and 200 Iskander missiles. Russia could be ready to challenge NATO militarily within five years. China also aims to have more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030. It is clear that those who stand against freedom are readying themselves for long-term confrontation with NATO. The alliance cannot wait idly by; instead, it must undertake efforts necessary to enhance our defenses. To make NATO stronger means investing much more in its defense, which underpins everything. All allies will spend at least two percent of GDP on defense this year. For the NATO summit in The Hague, we are preparing a concrete plan for allies to raise their investment in defense to five percent of GDP. This new benchmark is not chosen at random but is rooted in the reality of NATO's defense plans and the capability targets that stem from them. Five percent spending will be necessary to have the forces and capabilities to implement our defense plans in full and protect the Euro-Atlantic. This will mark a quantum leap in our collective defense. The bulk of spending will be put toward core defense requirements. Ambitious new targets, agreed to by NATO defense ministers in early June, define what forces and capabilities allies need to provide. The war against Ukraine has made clear how Russia can strike indiscriminately from the skies; at present, air, missile, and drone defenses are in short supply among NATO members. We must double our enabling capabilities, such as logistics, supply, transportation, and medical support. Allies will also invest in more warships, aircraft, drones, and long-range missile systems. NATO will sharpen its technological edge by spending more in the cyber and space domains, bolstering innovation, and speeding up its ability to integrate new technology into the defense sector. NATO is working closely with the European Union on military mobility and defense industrial cooperation. Substantial increases in demand for military hardware must be met with increased supply, not higher prices. Allies must be able to rapidly produce, sustain, and replenish military equipment, including basic munitions, complex weapons systems, and the rapidly evolving new technologies that are the hallmark of warfighting today. Given that NATO needs not only to defend itself but also to deter its adversaries, it must show that it can outproduce and outperform its rivals. That requires an industrial renaissance, not just in defense but across NATO economies. To make this a reality, NATO is supporting increased defense production, removing barriers to cooperation, harnessing cutting-edge technologies, and fostering innovation. For example, Task Force X Baltic is a NATO initiative to accelerate the deployment of uncrewed maritime systems, integrate artificial intelligence into naval operations, and secure the alliance's undersea infrastructure. We are also learning from Ukraine, which has shown how new or adapted technologies can sometimes deliver the same or even greater effect as traditional military “heavy metal” at a fraction of the cost. For example, Ukrainian drones that cost $400 have taken out $2 million Russian tanks. Increased defense spending and production not only strengthens NATO's ability to deter and defend but also acts as an engine for economic growth. Increasing defense spending will require allies to make difficult choices. They will hold vigorous debates about allocating more funding for defense and the tradeoffs that are required. But security is the foundation of prosperity, and there is no alternative to preserve our freedom and way of life. NATO will become stronger as its members invest more, better, and together in defense. The alliance will also become fairer as each ally contributes its part. The United States has carried an outsize portion of NATO's security burden for too long. But America's allies are clear in their commitment to sharing the responsibility within NATO more equally. European allies and Canada now lead seven of the eight multinational deployments on NATO's eastern flank. The United States' allies play a crucial role in long-term support to Kyiv—by providing personnel to NATO's Security Assistance and Training command for Ukraine in Wiesbaden and a significant share of security assistance. An Italian commander leads NATO's peacekeeping mission in Kosovo; a French general leads the training and advisory mission in Iraq; and European allies lead NATO's air policing over Iceland, the western Balkans, and the Baltics. The United States' allies will do even more for collective defense in the future, backed by Washington's rock-solid commitment to NATO. The threats against us are growing, so in addition to ensuring that NATO is stronger and fairer, we also need to become more lethal. NATO will always be a defensive alliance; the intent of its military might is to preserve peace. But to preserve the peace, we must prepare for war. That is precisely what we are doing at our next summit in The Hague.

The meeting took place immediately before SPIEF's plenary session, as Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing earlier. As Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov announced, the meeting's main topic was the Middle Eastern escalation. In Bahrain, the sheikh is directly responsible for addressing regional crisis-related issues. The escalation in the Middle East, triggered by Israel's unjustified strikes on Iran, has hindered air links in the region. However, Bahrain, by sending its high representative, has underlined the importance of its participation in SPIEF and of talks with Russia as one of the leading global players. The St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) is taking place on June 18-21. Thematic zones such as the ‘Territory of Innovation' and the national brand space ‘Buy Russian!' As part of the cultural program, the Petersburg Seasons festival will be held, and the SPIEF Sports Games will take place. TASS is its information partner.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That fattened the profit margins at Nutrien and drove its share price up – if only briefly – about 60 per cent in just over two months, to a high above $147. Though now well off those peaks in 2022, the stock is moving again: It has rallied about 31 per cent so far in 2025, as of Thursday. Much of this gain followed corporate cost savings, higher potash prices and upbeat spring planting activity. The price of corn, a key indicator of where fertilizer prices are headed, rallied about 25 per cent from October to February. But Israel's surprise attack against Iran, which began June 13 and has intensified this week with potential U.S. involvement, has added a geopolitical reason to the mix. “In terms of how big a deal this is, this is enormous,” said Chris Lawson, head of fertilizers at CRU International Ltd., the Britain-based commodities consultancy, in an e-mail. Iran has shut down its seven ammonia and urea production facilities. Egypt and Iran were responsible for nearly 20 per cent of global urea trade last year, according to Mr. Lawson. But add other exporters that use the Strait of Hormuz, and the share of global urea exports now at risk rises to 40 per cent. The old argument in favour of investing in fertilizer producers – at least long term – rested on rising demand for global food production and threatened arable land owing to urbanization and climate change. Nutrien plans new West Coast port infrastructure, eyes sites in U.S. and Canada Nutrien warns Trump's tariffs will hurt U.S. farmers who rely on Canadian potash Joel Jackson, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, noted that two nitrogen plants in Russia may have been hit by Ukrainian drones, halting production. That should put Nutrien – whose products extend across potash, nitrogen and phosphate produced in Canada and the United States – in a good place. Its gains this year have left some analysts cautious about whether the share price can move much higher. The stock's valuation is about midway between its historical five-year average, according to Steve Hansen, an analyst at Raymond James, meaning that it is by no means a screaming bargain. As well, rival producers could take advantage of this year's higher fertilizer prices by ramping up production, adding a point against the case for a looming supply crunch. In any case, BHP Group Ltd.'s Jansen mine in Saskatchewan is expected to become operational next year, and will become one of the biggest sources of potash when fully operational. If that doesn't make you nervous, then consider Nutrien's volatile share price. From its high in 2022, it fell 33 per cent by the end of the year, and flirted with a four-year low last year, as fertilizer prices meandered at cheap levels. Arriving late to a fertilizer rally or holding too long, in other words, can be painful. Still, Nutrien's share price is below highs reached during other rallies in recent years, and miles off its 2022 peak. That may give the stock some room to run. If continuing conflict and logistical hurdles keep fertilizer prices elevated, skeptical long-term investors could return to Nutrien as a stable, homegrown commodity producer that can generate consistent profits – potentially increasing the stock's valuation.

Foreign ministers from Britain, France and Germany, as well as the European Union's foreign policy chief, emerged from talks at a Geneva hotel about 3 1/2 hours after Iran's Abbas Araghchi arrived for the meeting. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that “we are keen to continue ongoing discussions and negotiations with Iran, and we urge Iran to continue their talks with the United States.” He added that “we were clear: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.” Lammy travelled to Geneva after meeting in Washington with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff. Trump has been weighing whether to attack Iran by striking its well-defended Fordow uranium enrichment facility, which is buried under a mountain and widely considered to be out of reach of all but America's “bunker-buster” bombs. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that “we wanted to open a discussion with the Iranian foreign minister because we believe that there is no definitive solution by military means to the Iranian nuclear problem – military operations may delay it but they can't eliminate it.” Iran said open to dialogue but no negotiations while attacks continue Iran's supreme leader rejected U.S. calls for surrender Wednesday and warned that any military involvement by the Americans would cause “irreparable damage to them.” Before Friday's talks, Araghchi said in an interview aired by Iranian state television that “in the current situation, as the Zionist regime's attacks continue, we are not seeking negotiations with anyone.” ”As for others, if they seek dialogue, not negotiations, which don't make sense right now, we have no problem with that,” he added. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though it was the only non-nuclear-armed state to enrich uranium up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. CHARLES KUPCHAN is Professor of International Affairs at Georgetown University and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. His most recent book is Isolationism: A History of America's Efforts to Shield Itself From the World. But amid its bungled Ukraine diplomacy, the Trump administration has gotten one important strategic issue right: it is time to take NATO membership for Ukraine off the table. After years of promises to bring Ukraine into the alliance, Washington is finally changing course. In February, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared that “the United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement.” Taking membership off the table will make it easier to negotiate a cease-fire with Russia, whose legitimate objections to Ukraine's entry into NATO partially motivated its invasion in 2022. And the Trump administration, for its part, is not alone in opposing Ukraine's NATO membership; despite past pledges, a consensus within the alliance to invite Ukraine to join has never emerged and is unlikely to materialize in the foreseeable future. Although they have spent the last three years arming Kyiv, NATO members have not put their own boots on the ground. In doing so, they have made it clear that the alliance does not believe that defending Ukraine should warrant war between NATO and Russia. Pretending otherwise only encourages Kyiv to futilely push for membership, weakening the Ukrainian leadership when it inevitably falls short. Instead, Ukrainians should be pursuing more realistic options for securing their future. At this year's NATO summit, which takes place next week in The Hague, the alliance should commit to providing Ukraine what it needs to defend itself against Russia. But NATO should also seize the moment to make clear that membership is not in Ukraine's future. In 1993, Russian President Boris Yeltsin warned against the alliance's eastward expansion, arguing that Moscow “would no doubt perceive this as a sort of neo-isolation of our country in diametric opposition to its natural admission into Euro-Atlantic space.” Two years later, Yeltsin was more pointed with U.S. President Bill Clinton: “For me to agree to the borders of NATO expanding towards those of Russia,” Yeltsin proclaimed during a visit by Clinton to Moscow, “would constitute a betrayal on my part of the Russian people.” Russian disgruntlement has grown in step with NATO's ranks, especially after Putin took office in 1999 and pursued a more confrontational foreign policy. At the 2007 Munich Security Conference, Putin described NATO enlargement as “a serious provocation” and asked, “Why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our borders?” The following year, the George W. Bush administration, despite the objection of Germany and other European allies, convinced NATO to declare at its Bucharest summit that Georgia and Ukraine would become members. In his address at the beginning of Russia's “special military operation” in Ukraine in February 2022, Putin cited “the fundamental threats which irresponsible Western politicians created for Russia,” singling out “the eastward expansion of NATO, which is moving its military infrastructure ever closer to the Russian border.” As he launched the first round of enlargement at NATO's 1997 summit, Clinton argued that NATO's open door would “erase the artificial line in Europe drawn by Stalin at the end of World War II.” Secretary of State Madeleine Albright attempted to assuage Russian concerns by arguing that NATO remained a “defensive alliance that . does not regard any state as its adversary,” reassuring Moscow that “NATO poses no danger to Russia.” Indeed, as Russian troops massed on Ukraine's border in early 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden insisted that “the United States and NATO are not a threat to Russia,” a claim echoed by then NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated that “NATO itself is a defensive alliance. Yet such arguments are either geopolitically naive or disingenuous. It is entirely understandable that Russia is reluctant to allow into its neighborhood an alliance that, although defensive, nonetheless brings to bear ample military power. Whether it is NATO's best tanks and aircraft, long-range strike weapons, or installations collecting intelligence, NATO's arrival in Ukraine would pose a threat to Russia by dint of its sheer proximity. But given Ukraine's strategic location, size, and historical connections to Russia, Moscow is particularly adamant that it not join NATO's ranks. Russia is hardly the only major power keen to keep rivals out of its neighborhood. More recently, State Department spokesperson Ned Price promised that the United States would “respond swiftly and decisively” after Russia mused about again deploying its troops in Latin America in 2022. Its own history fresh in mind, Washington should have been more attentive to Russia's concerns about Ukraine's membership in NATO. These arguments by no means justify Russia's 2014 and 2022 invasions of Ukraine, nor do they legitimize Putin's imperial ambitions or his delusions about the unbreakable civilizational ties between Russia and Ukraine. As he explained why “Ukraine coming into NATO is not on the table” in May, Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg admitted that Russian objections were “a fair concern.” Such sobriety and strategic prudence will come in handy as the Trump administration seeks to convince Putin to end the war. Ending Ukraine's bid for NATO membership would not only make it easier to negotiate a cease-fire, it would also be to shoot straight with Kyiv instead of continuing to make promises that will likely never be fulfilled. NATO's 2008 declaration that Georgia and Ukraine would eventually become members was a compromise; the Bush administration wanted to move them toward membership, although European leaders feared that doing so would inflame relations with Moscow. Not long after NATO's statement, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili provoked a violent clash with pro-Russian separatists in the South Ossetia region. The incident offered Russia an excuse to send in military forces and grab control of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Heading westward since the 2014 Maidan Revolution and Russia's subsequent invasion of Crimea and the Donbas, Ukrainians enshrined their NATO aspiration in their constitution in 2019. But when Russia invaded again in 2022, although NATO countries rushed weapons to Ukraine, Ukrainian soldiers have been on their own. But the result has been dashed expectations and growing frustration. After President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a blistering statement calling NATO's unwillingness to move ahead on Ukraine's membership “absurd” at the 2023 summit in Vilnius, NATO edged forward, asserting that “Ukraine's future is in NATO.” Again under pressure from Kyiv, the alliance in 2024 took yet another step, assuring Ukraine that its path to membership was “irreversible.” But the rhetoric only misleads; Ukraine remains on NATO's doorstep, encouraged to keep waiting outside but never allowed to enter. Kyiv is ultimately better off knowing the hard truth. Although they have yet to acknowledge it, member states have already taken a decisive step toward closing the door on NATO membership for Ukraine: they have made it clear through their actions that they do not deem it in their interests to go to war with Russia to defend Ukraine. Amid more than three years of fighting, around 500,000 Ukrainians have lost their lives or been wounded valiantly resisting Russia's onslaught. But NATO countries have not dispatched a single soldier to join the fight, having concluded that defending Ukraine does not warrant a direct war between NATO and Russia. Led by Washington, NATO has decided that the defense of Ukraine is not worth World War III. If Ukraine were attacked by Russia after becoming a NATO member, NATO could, of course, decide not to fight on its behalf. But failure to defend a member state would corrode the alliance's credibility. In short, NATO would find itself in an impossible position: fight a war against Russia it has previously determined not worth fighting or stand down and irreversibly—and perhaps fatally—undermine the Western alliance in the process. Seeing its bid for NATO membership fail will be a harsh and painful reality for Ukraine as it continues to suffer ruthless Russian attacks. Ukraine should also expedite its accession to the EU, a process that would speed up economic and political reforms and ultimately give the country at least a version of the security guarantee it seeks; Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union is a mutual defense clause. Moscow has indicated that it can live with Ukraine's integration into the EU, which it sees as a more benign economic and political bloc, not a military alliance. The proposal that has emerged from Trump's diplomatic efforts is sound: a cease-fire, with Russia holding on to the roughly 20 percent of Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies. But that deal is acceptable only if the remaining 80 percent of Ukraine emerges as a sovereign, secure, and prosperous democracy. Arriving at that outcome will require that NATO provide Ukraine the military capability, training, and intelligence needed to block further Russian advances, enabling Kyiv to make it clear to Putin that he has already conquered as much of Ukraine as he is going to get. Ukraine is unlikely to give up on restoring its territorial integrity. Taking Ukraine's NATO membership off the table will make such a deal much easier to attain. In return, NATO should demand that Russia agree to not only a permanent end to the war but also a renunciation of further territorial claims as well as any restrictions on Ukraine's armed forces and its ability to defend itself. A NATO consensus behind this plan may be elusive; some members, particularly along NATO's eastern flank, remain keen to bring Ukraine into the alliance. Trump, however, should employ his trademark willingness to say out loud what others are thinking but not dare say, and acknowledge a simple truth: NATO membership for Ukraine is unattainable.
