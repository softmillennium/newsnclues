                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Snap has acquired Saturn, a calendar app that helps students manage their school schedules and share them with others, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Friday. Snap says almost the entire Saturn team is joining Snap as part of the acquisition, with just under 30 full-time employees coming on board. Although Snap didn't share much about its plans for the acquisition, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that Snap will bring Saturn's calendaring expertise into Snapchat in innovative ways. The idea behind the startup is to allow high school and college students to connect with their classmates and see which classes their friends are in without having to share a bunch of pictures of different schedules. In addition to classes, users can share their schedules for practices, rehearsals, meetings, games, and more. Snap says that Saturn is used by a large number of schools and that 80% of U.S. high schools have support for Saturn. Snap believes that Saturn has built its success by turning scheduling into a more engaging and dynamic experience. The two companies will work together to foster more real-world connections, Snap says. Forbes reported in 2021 that Saturn raised $44 million in a funding round led by General Catalyst, Insight Partners, and Coatue, with participation from Bezos Expeditions, Marc Benioff, Dara Khosrowshahi, and Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary's Sound Ventures, among others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TerraPower, the nuclear startup founded and backed by Bill Gates, announced a new $650 million funding round this week. Like other nuclear startups, TerraPower has been riding a wave of interest from hyperscalers, data center developers, and, now, chip designers. Nvidia's venture arm, NVentures, participated in the round, marking its first energy investment. Bill Gates and HD Hyundai, both already on the cap table, also invested. Given the Trump administration's benign attitude toward nuclear, that timeline seems reasonable. When complete, TerraPower's first reactor will generate 345 megawatts of electricity, striking a middle ground between today's massive conventional reactors and tomorrow's promised small modular reactors. That's by design: when demand is low, the reactor can continue operating, heating sodium that is then stored in large tanks. Because nuclear power plants don't easily ramp up and down, this allows the Natrium reactors to continue operating at a steady state. But after uncertainties mounted, it changed course to pursue the current Natrium design. TerraPower claims it can complete a reactor within three years after the first batch of concrete is poured for the reactor. Still, considerable site preparation and construction needs to happen before that occurs. And while there are signs that the first Natrium reactor will be cheaper than recent U.S. reactors, it won't be cheap: the Associated Press reported last year that the bill could reach $4 billion, half of which could be shouldered by the Department of Energy.

You can go to Amazon right now to get the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3i Laptop for $280, down from its usual price of $450. Considering most of us just want a computer that turns on fast, runs smoothly, and can handle multitasking without overheating or freezing up, this is a great option because it's more than just that. You shouldn't have to shell out a huge chunk of cash just to enjoy that kind of reliability. The Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3i is all that and more, plus you'll pay less than you would for a new video game console for it. It has a 15.6-inch screen that gives you plenty of space to work or watch videos, and the Full HD resolution keeps everything from PowerPoint presentations to Netflix clear and sharp. And under the hood, it's powered by an Intel Core i3-N305 processor, 8GB of memory, and 128GB of UFS storage.

Nvidia's RTX 5090 is the latest GPU involved in a new scam, in which criminals are removing the GPU core and VRAM memory from RTX 5090s for their own purposes. Northwestrepair on YouTube received a Zotac RTX 5090 from a customer with no GPU core or GDDR7 memory chips attached to the PCB. The card's original owner was apparently trying to find one of Nvidia's best graphics cards for a steep discount, paying just $2,000 for their RTX 5090. Technically, $2,000 is the RTX 5090's MSRP, but in today's market, RTX 5090s regularly go for almost $3,000 with some models priced as high as $4,000 thanks to high demand. Any RTX 5090 priced at MSRP (or lower) is well below the card's real value in today's market, which explains how the owner got scammed. Northwestrepair received the Zotac RTX 5090 in good condition, except for one of the rear mounting screws which was completely stripped. What was left was a perfectly healthy PCB, with all other components intact, including the power delivery system, 16-pin power connector, and display outputs. There have been RTX 5090 scams in the past, but those scams involved replacing the graphics card itself with other products, such as macaroni and rice or backpacks. If history is anything to go by, these sorts of scams will only become more prevalent as time goes on. The best way to protect yourself is to watch out for RTX 5090 listings with suspiciously good deals and only buy graphics cards from reputable sources.

Sutskever ultimately turned Meta down, according to CNBC, but the company is now in talks to hire Safe Superintelligence's co-founder and CEO, Daniel Gross. Earlier this week, The Information reported that Meta was in talks to hire Gross, as well as former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. Meta is also reportedly taking a stake in Friedman and Gross's joint venture firm, NFDG, which has invested in prominent AI startups such as Perplexity and Character.AI. Gross and Friedman could significantly beef up Meta's AI superintelligence lab, adding leaders who have experience running and investing in AI research labs. Earlier this month, Meta announced that Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, and several executives from the data labeling startup, would join the company as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta's next generation of smart glasses is here, but it's not Ray-Ban doing the heavy lifting on design. This go-around, it's Oakley at the center, which may seem like a strange choice at first but makes more sense once you unpack how Meta is positioning its first new pair of smart glasses since its original Ray-Ban collab. In Meta's words, these things are all about “performance.” This pair focuses primarily on athletes who want to capture footage from the field, or mountain, or wherever you might be wearing a pair of Oakley glasses and not look like a total rube. And given that positioning, Meta's new glasses, which are called HSTN and pronounced “HOW-stuhn,” unfortunately, will come with a few major upgrades over their Ray-Ban forebear. Perfect for an action sports scenario where you'd want crisper, sharper video. Meta's Oakley glasses will also have a longer battery life. For context, Meta's Ray-Ban glasses last about four hours with “moderate use.” I can corroborate that battery life estimate, having worn Meta's Ray-Ban glasses as my main pair of sunglasses for the better part of a year, though sometimes I feel like I get a little less. Having a longer-life battery also makes sense from a “performance” sports-oriented perspective since you probably don't want to be charging these things up when you're hanging off the side of a mountain covered in fresh powder. And, of course, Meta's glasses wouldn't be complete without some AI. Meta's voice assistant is mostly fine for simple stuff like “take a picture” and “record a video,” but I've had very mixed results with more complex vision-based tasks like “What kind of car is that?” or even sometimes asking for weather and triggering specific songs on Spotify. What I'm saying is, take Meta's examples here with a grain of salt. According to Meta, the full collection will drop later this summer for $399 while a limited-edition pair in a special colorway (Desert 24K Prizm Polar) will be available for preorder starting July 11 for $499 USD. That's a premium compared to the Ray-Ban glasses, which typically retail for $299, but at least you're getting some extra battery and a nicer camera to go with it.

The concept of what is internally called Project Crystal Land involves creating a complex for building artificial intelligence systems and robotics. Masayoshi Son's Project Crystal Land aims to replicate the scale and integration of China's Shenzhen by establishing a high-tech hub focused on manufacturing AI-powered industrial robots and advancing artificial intelligence technologies. If fully realized, the project could cost up to $1 trillion and is intended to position the U.S. as a leading center for AI and high-tech manufacturing. However, a Bloomberg source familiar with TSMC's internal thinking indicated that the company's current plan to invest $165 billion in total in its U.S. projects has no relation to SoftBank's projects. Samsung Electronics has also been approached about participating, the report says. Talks have been held with government officials to explore tax incentives for companies investing in the manufacturing hub. This includes communication with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to Bloomberg. The development is still in the early stages, and feasibility will depend on private sector interest and political support, sources familiar with SoftBank's plans told Bloomberg. To finance its Project Crystal Land, SoftBank is considering project-based financing structures typically used in large infrastructure developments like pipelines. This approach would enable fundraising on a per-project basis and reduce the amount of upfront capital required from SoftBank itself. A similar model is being explored for the Stargate AI data center initiative, which SoftBank is jointly pursuing with OpenAI, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi's MGX. Melissa Otto of Visible Alpha suggested in a Bloomberg interview that rather than spending heavily, Son might more efficiently support his AI project by fostering partnerships between manufacturers, AI engineers, and specialists in fields like medicine and robotics, and by backing smaller startups. However, she notes that investing in data centers could also reduce AI development costs and drive wider adoption, which would be good for the long term for AI in general and Crystal Land specifically. Nonetheless, it is still too early to judge the outcome. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The rumor about the Crystal Land project has emerged as SoftBank is expanding its investments in AI on an already large scale. To increase available funds, the company recently sold about a quarter of its T-Mobile U.S. stake, raising $4.8 billion. Such vast resources provide SoftBank with room to secure additional financing if necessary, Bloomberg notes Anton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom's Hardware.

A new report indicates that Taiwan manufacturing giant Foxconn and Nvidia are in talks over the prospect of deploying humanoid robots at a new Foxconn facility in Houston. It is purported the bots would be used in the construction of Nvidia's new GB300 AI servers, which will go into production of at the plant next year, according to Reuters. Both Foxconn and Nvidia are reportedly trialling humanoid robots, the latter using China's UBTech. However, according to the report, it is unclear at this stage what type of robots would be used in the Houston factory, what they would look like, or how many would be used. As to the role of the robots, Foxconn has allegedly trained them to pick up and put down objects, insert cables, and do assembly work. The Houston factory is tipped as a great proving ground because it's newer and larger, with more space than Foxconn's existing facilities. Later this year, Foxconn is expected to showcase two new robots, one a humanoid model with legs, and the other a wheeled autonomous robot base.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research suggests that while cutting calories might help you lose weight and reduce risk of disease, it also carries health risks. Despite what you might hear on social media or in advertisements, there are no drugs that are known to slow or reverse human aging. But there's some evidence to support another approach: cutting back on calories. Caloric restriction (reducing your intake of calories) and intermittent fasting (switching between fasting and eating normally on a fixed schedule) can help with weight loss. But they may also offer protection against some health conditions. And some believe such diets might even help you live longer—a finding supported by new research out this week. (Longevity enthusiast Bryan Johnson famously claims to eat his last meal of the day at 12pm.) Some scientists warn that, based on evidence in animals, it could negatively impact wound healing, metabolism and bone density. This week let's take a closer look at the benefits—and risks—of caloric restriction. This remarkable finding has been published in scientific journals for the last 100 years. It seems to work in almost every animal studied—everything from tiny nematode worms and fruit flies to mice, rats, and even monkeys. It can extend the lifespan of rodents by between 15% and 60%, depending on which study you look at. And both have been found to increase the lifespans of animals in some studies. But when scientists looked at 167 published studies of those three interventions in research animals, they found that caloric restriction was the most “robust.” According to their research, published in the journal Aging Cell on Wednesday, the effect of rapamycin was somewhat comparable, but metformin was nowhere near as effective. “That is a pity for the many people now taking off-label metformin for lifespan extension,” David Clancy, lecturer in biogerontology at Lancaster University, said in a statement. (As I said, caloric restriction has been an active area of research for a long time.) This is really a question about how our bodies store and use the energy we need to function. There were other benefits, too—but they depended on the specific approach to dieting. Fasting every other day seemed to help lower cholesterol, for example. Time-restricted eating, where you only eat within a specific period each day (à la Bryan Johnson), by comparison, seemed to increase cholesterol, the researchers write in the BMJ. Dietary restriction seems to impair wound healing in mice and rats, for example. In some studies, the biggest effects on lifespan extension are seen when rats are put on calorie-restricted diets early in life. It's also really hard for most people to cut their caloric intake. When researchers ran a two-year trial to measure the impact of a 25% reduction in caloric intake, they found that the most their volunteers could cut was 12%. (That study found that caloric restriction reduces markers of inflammation, which can be harmful when it's chronic, and had only a small impact on bone density.) Unfortunately, there's a lot we still don't really understand about caloric restriction. And we don't know whether it extends the lifespan of people. It isn't possible to conduct a randomized clinical trial in which you deprive people of food from childhood and then wait their entire lives to see when they die. It is notoriously difficult to track or change your diet. And given the unknowns surrounding caloric restriction, it's too soon to make sweeping recommendations, particularly given that your own personal biology will play a role in any benefits or risks you'll experience.
