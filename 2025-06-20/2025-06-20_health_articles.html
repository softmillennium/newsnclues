                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new review highlights the transformative potential of transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) in the field of liquid biopsy, emphasizing their role as promising biomarkers for a wide range of diseases, particularly cancers. These non-coding RNA fragments, originating from mature or precursor tRNAs, are detectable in diverse body fluids—including blood plasma, saliva, urine, semen, and cerebrospinal fluid—and exhibit remarkable stability, even in challenging biological environments. The article presents tsRNAs as a rising star in precision medicine, with significant diagnostic and prognostic value. In breast cancer, certain circulating tsRNAs are associated with improved prognostic accuracy compared to traditional markers, while in lung cancer, tsRNA signatures have helped differentiate between early and advanced stages. tsRNAs have also shown promise in gastrointestinal, ovarian, pancreatic, renal, and bladder cancers, as well as in conditions like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, infertility, and neurodegenerative disorders. A notable advantage of tsRNAs is their presence across multiple biofluids, enabling non-invasive sampling that is more accessible and less risky than tissue biopsies. This versatility opens up opportunities for early detection, disease monitoring, and treatment stratification. Importantly, tsRNAs demonstrate unique expression profiles distinct from similar small RNA classes like miRNAs, reinforcing their biological relevance and clinical utility. The article also discusses challenges such as inconsistent nomenclature, variation in sample preparation, and the need for optimized detection platforms like PANDORA-seq. It calls for standardized analytical frameworks to enable consistent cross-study comparisons and emphasizes the importance of accounting for age-related and tissue-specific variation in tsRNA expression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new review published in Genes & Diseases explores the intricate epigenetic regulatory network of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), shedding light on the profound impact of DNA methylation, histone modifications, RNA methylation, and microRNAs on lncRNA transcription. This analysis highlights how these regulatory mechanisms drive the progression of liver cancer, offering valuable insights for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The role of lncRNAs in cancer biology has become increasingly evident, as they regulate gene expression, chromatin remodeling, and cellular signaling pathways. The review delves into how DNA methylation silences tumor-suppressing lncRNAs, while histone modifications either promote or inhibit their expression depending on the nature of methylation or acetylation. Additionally, RNA methylation—particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification—emerges as a crucial mechanism altering the stability and translation of these transcripts. Beyond direct modifications, microRNAs (miRNAs) play a pivotal role in fine-tuning lncRNA expression through post-transcriptional regulation. The interplay between miRNAs and lncRNAs creates a complex competing endogenous RNA network, impacting key oncogenic and tumor-suppressive pathways in HCC. Understanding these epigenetic interactions opens avenues for novel biomarkers that could revolutionize early detection, prognosis, and treatment approaches. The identification of epigenetically regulated lncRNAs paves the way for targeted therapies that modulate their function, potentially overcoming drug resistance and enhancing therapeutic efficacy. This review offers a deeper comprehension of how lncRNA-driven epigenetic regulation contributes to HCC pathogenesis. These insights provide a foundation for developing innovative RNA-based therapies aimed at disrupting cancer-promoting networks while preserving essential cellular functions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, MSCs have a limited proliferation capacity, with their quality varying depending on the donor's age and where they were harvested from. For this reason, a method for producing MSCs using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is attracting attention as a means to provide a stable supply of homogeneous MSCs. IPSCs have unlimited proliferation capacity and can be differentiated into various cell types. Despite this potential, there are only a limited number of studies focusing on dogs. To improve canine medicine, a research team led by Professor Shingo Hatoya and Dr. Masaya Tsukamoto at Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Veterinary Science has successfully generated iPSCs from four different types of canine somatic cells. Using these cells, the optimal method for producing canine MSCs was investigated. By applying a method used for producing human MSCs, the research team successfully produced quality canine MSCs with high proliferation capacity and expressed MSC markers. Furthermore, when comparing four types of iPS cell-derived MSCs, it was found that the highest quality MSCs were obtained from urine cells. The establishment of a method for producing highly proliferative canine MSCs is expected to advance regenerative veterinary medicine." Dr. Masaya Tsukamoto, Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Veterinary Science Professor Hatoya concluded, "Going forward, we plan to conduct further verification of the immune regulatory and therapeutic effects of MSCs produced from canine iPS cells."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) and Nanjing University in China have developed a new drug delivery system that could improve how treatments of cancers and other diseases are delivered. Their study, published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, describes a new type of nanoparticle made by combining a widely used medical polymer with a natural blood protein. These particles can carry much larger amounts of disease-fighting drugs and remain stable much longer than current nanoparticle systems. For years, biodegradable plastics such as PLGA have been used to create nanoparticles that release medicine into the body slowly. These delivery systems are especially useful for diseases like cancer, which often require steady, controlled doses of medication. However, many of the nanoparticles used today tend to clump together over time and usually carry only a small amount of a drug. "We managed to solve two big problems at once," says Dr. "These new particles are made by mixing a medical-grade plastic called PLGA with albumin, a protein found in blood. Albumin already plays a role in carrying substances through the body and is used in some current cancer drugs. When mixed with PLGA in the lab, they naturally come together to form tiny, stable particles that are much better than using albumin or PLGA alone." "One of the most exciting things is that these particles can hold up to 40% of the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin by weight," says Dr. Zixing Xu, who was a visiting PhD student at XJTLU from Nanjing University, and was a co-first author as well as co-corresponding author of the study. "That's a big improvement over some existing treatments, such as Doxil, which hold about 11%. Carrying more drug with less material could help reduce side effects for patients." They found that combining the two produced better results than using either method alone. Tests in lab-grown cells and in animals showed that the new particles delivered drugs effectively while causing less damage to healthy tissues. Another major advantage was their long-term stability – the particles stayed intact for over six months, much longer than most current options. Preliminary studies of production scale-up indicate that these nanoparticles can be made at larger scale without losing quality. The researchers plan to continue exploring how these nanoparticles can be adapted to carry other types of drugs, potentially offering a more versatile and reliable platform for treating cancer and other chronic diseases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In patients with cirrhosis and acute fundal variceal bleeding, the use of preemptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (p-TIPS) with a covered stent within 72 hours of initial bleeding resulted in superior outcomes, with a higher probability of patients being free of death or rebleeding at 1 year than those using standard treatment. "In patients with cirrhosis and bleeding from fundal varices, p-TIPS with a covered stent is associated with markedly decreased death or rebleeding and should therefore be considered as a first-line therapy," they added. This study was led by Jean-Paul Cervoni, MD, Service d'Hépatologie et de Soins Intensifs, CHU Besançon, Besançon, France. It was published online on June 12, 2025, in The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology. A small sample size precluded definitive subgroup analyses (eg, variceal type).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These vessels are in charge of moving oxygen throughout the body and removing waste products. There are several modifiable risk factors that can help keep your vascular system healthy, including not smoking, staying at a healthy weight, exercising, eating right, and keeping your blood pressure and cholesterol levels down. If your vascular system is not functioning properly, it can increase your risk for vascular diseases such as aneurysm, peripheral artery disease, pulmonary embolism, and varicose veins. Now, a new study recently published in the journal JAMA Neurology has found a link between certain midlife vascular risk factors — specifically high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking — and risk for dementia. Researchers focused on three main vascular risk factors for this study: high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking. “That 22-44% of population-level dementia risk by 80 years was attributed to at least one vascular risk factor from midlife through early late-life (ages 45-74 years) signals a major prevention gap,” Smith explained. “It has a heterogeneous presentation and pathology, so targeting risk factors that are modifiable, more proximal to dementia expression (including hypertension, diabetes, and smoking), and that could potentially impact more than one underlying process giving rise to dementia, is paramount to reduce population-level dementia risk.” “Caution's warranted when interpreting these stratified analyses, given wide (confidence intervals),” Smith said. “And that the vascular contribution was larger among those racialized as Black is likely due to a higher burden of vascular risk factors in this population,” he continued. “More inclusive and representative research is urgently needed to understand the prevention potential of vascular risk reduction in different populations.” “While this study is not designed to provide evidence on individual-level dementia risk reduction, promoting optimal vascular health as early as midlife could be vital for reducing population-level dementia risk by 80 years,” Smith added. MNT spoke with Christopher Yi, MD, a board certified vascular surgeon at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. “My first reaction was that the findings were both striking and practical — nearly half of dementia cases by age 80 could be linked to modifiable vascular risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking,” he continued. “It's especially notable that late-life vascular health appeared even more strongly associated with dementia risk than midlife health, which challenges the idea that ‘it's too late' to make a difference after midlife.” Yi explained that vascular health affects dementia risk through several interconnected mechanisms. “High blood pressure and vascular disease can damage the small vessels that supply the brain, leading to chronic ischemia (lack of oxygen) and brain tissue damage,” he detailed. For the next steps in this research, Yi said he would like to see more intervention trials, risk factor-specific analyses, mechanistic studies, and policy translation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The role of Fibroblast Growth Factor 8 (FGF8) in embryonic development and organ formation is gaining increased recognition as scientists uncover its wide-ranging influence. FGF8, a powerful signaling molecule, is essential for orchestrating the growth and differentiation of multiple tissues, including craniofacial structures, limbs, internal organs, and the brain. It plays a pivotal role in craniofacial development, ensuring the proper formation of the jaw, palate, and other skeletal structures. Abnormal FGF8 activity has been associated with skeletal malformations, including cleft palate and craniofacial syndromes. FGF8 is also central to limb formation, directing patterning and segmentation to ensure normal growth of the arms and legs. Research further underscores its role in kidney development, where it regulates nephron formation and organ function, with defects potentially leading to renal abnormalities and congenital kidney disorders. In cardiac development, FGF8 is required for the formation of the heart and great vessels, influencing processes such as outflow tract remodeling and valve formation. Dysregulation of FGF8 has been implicated in congenital heart defects, including persistent truncus arteriosus and outflow tract malformations, which can lead to severe cardiovascular conditions. The nervous system is another area where FGF8 exerts profound effects. It governs the development of key brain structures, including the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, playing a crucial role in neuronal differentiation and connectivity. Variations in FGF8 expression have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Kallmann syndrome, holoprosencephaly, and CHARGE syndrome, which impact cognitive function, sensory processing, and neuroendocrine signaling. With its far-reaching impact, FGF8 is a key focus in the field of developmental biology and regenerative medicine. Understanding its precise mechanisms could lead to targeted therapeutic strategies for treating congenital anomalies and tissue regeneration. As advancements in gene editing and molecular medicine continue to evolve, FGF8 remains a critical factor in unlocking the complexities of human growth and disease prevention.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emerging research highlights the crucial role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in disease progression, offering promising avenues for early detection and innovative treatments. These non-coding RNA molecules, known for their stability and regulatory functions, are proving to be pivotal in tumor biology and immune response modulation. Unlike linear RNAs, circRNAs have a closed-loop structure that makes them resistant to degradation, allowing them to serve as long-lasting regulators of gene expression. They influence multiple cancer-related processes, including tumor proliferation, metastasis, immune evasion, and drug resistance. Specific circRNAs such as circRNA-100338, circRNA-101764, and circBACH1 have been identified as key players in HCC progression, affecting crucial signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB. By acting as molecular sponges for microRNAs (miRNAs), these circRNAs help modulate cancer-promoting genes, making them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. The potential of circRNAs extends beyond treatment to early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation. Blood-based biomarkers, including circRNA panels, have demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity in distinguishing HCC from chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis, outperforming traditional markers like alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). With liquid biopsy techniques gaining traction, circRNAs could revolutionize non-invasive cancer detection, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes. Targeting circRNAs for therapy is an exciting frontier in RNA-based medicine. Cutting-edge approaches, including RNA interference (RNAi), CRISPR-based gene editing, and nanoparticle delivery systems, are being explored to selectively suppress tumor-promoting circRNAs or restore tumor-suppressive ones. Additionally, circRNA-based vaccines are under development, leveraging their ability to encode therapeutic proteins while avoiding rapid degradation. However, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinical applications, including the need for precise delivery systems, validation in large-scale studies, and better understanding of circRNA interactions with host immune pathways.
