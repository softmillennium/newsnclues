                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The SEC likely views cryptocurrencies Litecoin, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano and others as “commodities.” In a social media post on Friday, Seffart said he and Balchunas have raised their odds for the vast majority of crypto ETF approvals to “90% or higher,” citing “very positive” engagement from the SEC. The analysts also suggested that the SEC “likely” views cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) as commodities — a designation that would place them outside of its immediate jurisdiction. He speculated the process could take several months and may extend beyond October. Related: ETF issuers pen letter urging SEC return to ‘first-to-file' approvals As Balchunas noted, IBIT reached that milestone in just 341 days. However, Bitcoin's success may be difficult to replicate, given the lukewarm demand for Ether (ETH) ETFs since they launched last July. While demand for other crypto assets could eventually outpace Ether, altcoins are unlikely to erode Bitcoin's dominance in the ETF market anytime soon. Nevertheless, investors are keeping a close eye on several proposals, such as Franklin Templeton's XRP and SOL ETFs, which were recently opened for public comments by the SEC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What started as a positive day for crypto markets quickly reversed during the U.S. session with bitcoin BTC$103,483.45 sliding below $103,000 from the $106,500 level just hours earlier. Ethereum's ether ETH$2,423.65 saw a sharp 4.5% drop in just 90 minutes to as low as $2,372, with trading volume spiking to nearly 800,000 ETH, nearly eight times the average hourly volume, per CoinDesk data. The volatility burst caught many traders off-guard, liquidating about $450 million in derivatives trading positions on centralized exchanges across all digital assets, CoinGlass data shows. Some $387 million of liquidations were tied to long positions that bet on profiting from rising prices. While macro risks abound — among them the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran — there was no immediate external reason for the sudden price swing. Zooming out, BTC continues to trade within a sideways range between $100,000 and $110,000, consolidating just below its all-time record level. "The mixed view of whether BTC will go above $110,000 again or drop into the $90,000 area doesn't surprise me at all and underscores the overall indecision people and markets feel," said James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet. "The present BTC stalemate reflects a market caught between bullish long-term sentiment and short-term macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Joe Lubin led a $425 million investment to launch the largest corporate Ether treasury company, the comparisons to Michael Saylor were immediate. Even Vitalik Buterin quipped that Lubin had become the “Mr. Saylor of ETH” at an industry event in Berlin this month. But a closer look shows that amassing Ether on a listed firm's balance sheet is actually quite different from the approach Saylor pioneered at MicroStrategy, now dubbed Strategy. If Bitcoin was designed to be digital money, then Ethereum was invented to be an ecosystem for decentralised financial apps and ventures. “We'll do all the different things to raise money through equity sales and debt that Saylor's brilliantly pioneered,” Lubin, the CEO of Consensys, told DL News in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. “We can also do so much more,” he said. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum relies on a proof of stake consensus model to validate and confirm various transactions on the blockchain. Validators earn rewards, or yield, for accurately confirming transactions. If they behave maliciously or dishonestly, such as validating fraudulent transactions, the network takes a small portion of the 32 Ether staked as a fine. Now SharpLink Gaming, the company Consensys picked to be an Ether vehicle, is entering the staking arena in a big way. As of June 13, SharpLink, an online sports betting company, has deposited more than 95% of its $463 million stash back into Ethereum to validate transactions. The move is generating an average staking yield of 3%, which means SharpLink is raking in roughly $14 million on an annualised basis. Ethereum's staking model also benefits from the high price of Ether. “It's really good for the platform to lock up a giant amount of Ether.” Lubin also says he has plans to turn SharpLink's stock, which goes by the ticker SBET, into an onchain token, launch prediction markets, and potentially integrate Consensys' crypto wallet MetaMask throughout. The SharpLink manoeuvre has vaulted Lubin back into a precinct of the financial world he left long ago — Wall Street. As SharpLink's new chairman, Lubin is now obliged to preside over quarterly earnings calls and engage with analysts and investors. As such, he is fascinated by how sophisticated investors will respond to his new Ethereum flywheel at SharpLink. He hopes analysts will pore over his treasury strategy. And the timing couldn't be more critical. Just as Bitcoin and Solana soared to all-time highs in the first quarter, Ethereum lagged far behind. “Bitcoin ended up doing very well, partially because Saylor did a great job,” Lubin said. In fact, if you had bought Ethereum this time last year and held, you would be down 27% on your investment. Instead, they got Lubin and a dozen other crypto investment firms, including Arrington Capital and Galaxy Digital, to buy up more than 69,000 shares in SharpLink and turn the online sports betting company into the second-largest holder of Ether after the Ethereum Foundation. SBET soared 2,700% in just four days following the announcement, raising similar bullish expectations for Ethereum. This prompted a major plunge in the stock. Lubin said Consensys was not planning on selling its stake but the damage was done — SharpLink's gains have evaporated. Back in 2014, he collaborated with Buterin, Gavin Wood, and other co-founders to develop the DeFi talisman. But with the SharpLink play, he hopes to captivate a new audience. Alongside pitching SBET analysts on Ethereum applications and DeFi on earnings calls, Lubin expects mainstream news networks will come calling soon, too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum is approaching a critical test as price action tightens, setting the stage for a decisive move above key demand. After weeks of volatile yet controlled trading, bulls are attempting to reclaim higher ground, but momentum remains limited. At the same time, bears have repeatedly failed to drive ETH below the $2,400 level, reinforcing it as a strong support zone for now. With global markets under pressure from geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty, Ethereum's next move could define the direction of the broader altcoin market. The setup has reached an inflection point after multiple tests of the lower support band, with bulls continuing to defend it against breakdown attempts. This consolidation phase, combined with suppressed volatility and rising macro tension, makes Ethereum's current structure one of the most significant technical formations in crypto right now. All eyes are now on ETH/BTC as traders prepare for what could be a defining moment in the altcoin cycle. Ethereum continues to trade within a narrow range that began in early May, hovering between the $2,400 and $2,800 levels. This prolonged consolidation comes at a time of growing geopolitical instability, as the conflict in the Middle East escalates and macroeconomic uncertainty grips global markets. While many investors had anticipated an altseason by now, that rotation of capital into altcoins has yet to materialize. All eyes remain on Ethereum to serve as the catalyst for that next leg higher. “I am 80/20 in favor of the upside,” he said, citing the market's inability to break lower as a sign of underlying strength. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,550, maintaining its position above all major weekly moving averages—50, 100, and 200. This level marks a key technical pivot as price consolidates between $2,450 and $2,680 after a strong recovery from its April low near $1,500. Despite multiple attempts to break higher, ETH continues to face resistance just below the $2,700 mark, showing that sellers remain active near historical supply zones. This indicates structural strength, especially considering the broader macro uncertainty driven by Middle East tensions and tighter U.S. monetary policy. Volume remains steady, with no signs of panic selling, further supporting the idea that ETH is stabilizing. The current compression in price around key moving averages typically precedes a larger directional move.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON, June 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Vector Smart Chain (VSC), a Layer 1 blockchain protocol, has announced two strategic developments: the implementation of a fixed $4 gas fee model and the appointment of Peter Ritchie, former Chief Financial Officer at CitiGroup Finance, as Strategic Finance Executive Consultant. These developments signal VSC's growing influence at the intersection of blockchain innovation and institutional-grade finance. In a space dominated by volatile transaction fees and scalability challenges, VSC's flat-rate $4 gas fee provides predictable costs, greater accessibility, and enhanced user confidence. "The $4 gas fee isn't arbitrary—it's carefully designed to balance network security and accessibility," said a VSC spokesperson. VSC's hybrid consensus mechanism ensures high throughput and near-instant transaction finality, making it ideal for enterprise adoption and real-world applications such as asset tokenization. Notably, BESC Exchange recently announced its migration from Solana to VSC. "We believe VSC's infrastructure and economics offer the highest upside," said Brian, Executive at BESC LLC. To support its rapid growth and sustainability-focused vision, VSC has welcomed Peter Ritchie—former CFO of CitiGroup Finance—to help drive global financial strategy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. Happy Friday everyone, it's finance editor Jeff Roberts pinch-hitting for Allie. Since I moved to Southern California two years ago, I've been struck by the region's thriving venture capital scene—one that seems to fly under the media radar compared to Silicon Valley and New York. I recently spoke to a longtime veteran of the scene, Adam Winnick. Winnick is a lively guy and has that all-important VC quality of being able to convene influential people. I first encountered him last month at a dinner for members of the Medici Network, a crypto-focused institutional investor conference, that brought together everyone from startup founders to bankers to representatives of Ivy League endowments and sovereign wealth funds. The dinner took place at Avra in Beverly Hills. Having attended more than a few of these things, one thing I noticed—aside from the excellent Mediterranean food—was just how normal it felt. Crypto investing now feels like just another stream in venture capital, though some obvious differences remain—especially when it comes to getting paid. Unlike the traditional model where VCs obtain a bushel of shares from a startup, and then wait seven years, the crypto VC world is more liquid and revolves around tokens not stock. (If you want a closer look, check out this deep dive on the topic by Leo). In the early days, the mix of crypto and venture capital resulted in some pretty egregious behavior—think VCs filling their bags with tokens tied to half-baked projects, and then dumping them onto retail investors. “It's a powerful incentive mechanism to bootstrap network effects. Just because people misuse them today or didn't know what to do with them early on doesn't mean they're not going to be used in the future,” he observes. Tokens are likely to become a more common feature of the VC landscape if, as Winnick predicts, the worlds of traditional tech and crypto move closer together. If this convergence is indeed taking place, Winnick says the winners will be those who can figure out how to combine the mature tech stack and broad business networks of so-called Web2 with the highly technical and less capital intensive dynamics of Web3. Winnick, a former banker, and his cofounder Kamel Mokeddem, a former Oracle exec, appear to be cracking the code on crypto investing. The IRR for the inaugural $45 million fund at their firm Finality Partners was 69% at the end of last year, and boasts Series A investments in promising crypto staking projects like Eigen Layer and Babylon. Meanwhile, though it's early days, the fund's second vehicle Liquid Fund is up 12% this year at a time when many other funds are posting flat or negative returns for the first part of 2025. While Finality Partners is dwarfed by the giants of the crypto VC world like a16z and Haun Ventures, the traction its partners have gained suggest they've found a lane of their own—an achievement Winnick attributes to his willingness to give blunt advice and be directly accessible to the firm's portfolio companies. As always, Term Sheet is curious to hear your thoughts. Do you think the worlds of crypto and traditional VCs are coming closer together?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum has been struggling to break out of its recent consolidation range, with price movements staying within $2,681 and $2,476. However, there is growing optimism within the market as Ethereum continues to see substantial investor interest. This support from the growing number of new wallet holders hints at a potential breakout in the near future. Since mid-May, the number of new wallets created each week has jumped from 800,000 to 1 million. The growth indicates a high level of investor interest, with many believing that Ethereum will generate profits in the near term. Ethereum's macro momentum is also showing positive signs. The recent surge in whale activity is a particularly noteworthy development. Addresses holding between 1,000 to 10,000 ETH have seen a sharp increase in their holdings, rising to 14.3 million ETH, or about 18.6% of the total circulating supply. The increasing concentration of ETH in the hands of whales reflects their confidence in Ethereum's long-term potential. This is often seen as a precursor to price recovery, as whales tend to hold significant influence over price movement. Despite recent volatility, ETH has been unable to break free from this price zone. Until it can secure a move above $2,681, the price is likely to remain within this tight range, with sharp movements in either direction quickly reversing. However, based on the growth in network activity and whale accumulation, Ethereum may be poised for a breakout. A successful breach of the $2,606 resistance, followed by a move past $2,681, would signal that the consolidation phase is coming to an end. If these levels are confirmed, Ethereum's price could rise to new highs.

New legislation that updates key aspects of data protection law has received royal assent.

The Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUAA) makes a number of changes to the law, including: clarifying how personal information can be used for research; lifting restrictions on some automated decision making; setting out how to use some cookies without consent; allowing charities to send people electronic mail marketing without consent in certain circumstances; requiring organisations to have a data protection complaints procedure and introducing a new lawful basis of recognised legitimate interests.

The Act provides the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) with new powers, including the ability to compel witnesses to attend interviews, request technical reports, and issue fines of up to £17.5 million or four per cent of global turnover under PECR. 

John Edwards, Information Commissioner, said: “The Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 gives organisations using personal information new and better opportunities to innovate and grow in the UK, and further enhances our ability to balance innovation and economic growth with strong protections for people's rights.

“We've published a catalogue of resources to help explain what this new legislation means for businesses. Over the coming months we will launch new guidance, open consultations, and provide practical tools to help embed the Act's principles into everyday operations. Our goal is to ensure that data can be used confidently and responsibly to deliver better services, drive economic growth, and uphold public trust.”

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), on the other hand, started out as digital art and collectibles. But the line between these two is blurring fast. These on-chain assets are no longer just speculative toys or collectibles. They're becoming tools for building entirely new types of value. DeFi is about automating financial functions using smart contracts. Lending, borrowing, trading, and earning interest can all be done on-chain, without the need for a middleman. The transparency and composability of these services make DeFi extremely flexible. But up until now, most of it has been centered around fungible tokens, currencies that are identical and interchangeable. Each token can carry its own identity, metadata, and utility. By wrapping DeFi positions inside NFTs, developers are turning financial contracts into tradable, portable assets. The term “Financial NFT” is being used more often to describe these new types of on-chain instruments. They bundle traditional DeFi mechanics with the flexibility and uniqueness of NFTs. Bringing together DeFi and NFTs is not just a novelty. In traditional finance, selling a bond or loan contract might involve paperwork and counterparty risks. In DeFi, when these are wrapped as NFTs, you can instantly sell them on-chain with full transparency. NFTs let users hold unique financial assets tailored to their needs. This personalization isn't possible with standard fungible tokens. Instead of managing multiple positions across different platforms, everything can be wrapped and managed as a single, portable NFT. This shift has also opened new paths for traders and everyday users. For example, those already active on a cryptocurrency trading platform can now explore alternative asset classes with real financial utility. It's expanding the very idea of what “trading” means in a decentralized world. It's about building financial products that behave in more flexible, modular ways. Traditional markets move slow, rely on outdated infrastructure, and are often closed systems. And that's attractive to more than just crypto users. Developers are creating financial instruments that can adapt on the fly, integrate with other services, and evolve as market conditions change. Add to this the rising awareness of digital identity, privacy, and composability, and it's clear this space is just getting started. When they merge, the result is a smarter, more dynamic form of finance. As the tools become more polished and the risks better understood, we're likely to see these hybrid assets integrated into everything from trading platforms to everyday payment systems. It's a signal that on-chain finance is evolving into something far more useful, flexible, and user-driven than anything we've seen before. While smart contract bugs are always a concern in DeFi, NFTs can also be more illiquid depending on how niche the asset is. However, wrapping positions as NFTs doesn't inherently make them more dangerous. Can I use NFTs to improve my yield strategy? This increases flexibility and may lead to higher returns if managed wisely. These hybrid models are drawing interest from more traditional traders and investors who are used to having a CFD trading account and want exposure to digital asset innovation without losing the structure they're used to.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a striking move, Bitcoin price has started pumping today, with it surging past the $106K mark and eyeing new weekly highs in a potentially continued rally ahead of the last trading session of this week in the U.S. stock markets. As per TradingView data, Bitcoin is currently trading at $106,420—up 1.53% in the past 24 hours. It has a 24-hour trading volume of 38.96%, slightly lower than average. Following Bitcoin, leading altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP have also caught an upward momentum, both the alts looking to break above key resistance levels. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading near $2,560—up 1.48% in the past 24 hours, while XRP is struggling to surge past its daily high of $2.176. The crypto market's sudden upward surge today appears to be driven by a confluence of factors. Moreover, Donald Trump's recent remarks on Jerome Powell about his view on rate cuts could also be a reason for this strong push. It is also coupled with increased Bitcoin demand from corporate treasuries. Also read: Will Bitcoin Price Close Below 50-DMA As BOJ Pushes for Rate Hike?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $2,500 in the early Asian session on Friday despite a surge in new address growth over the past month. The number of new ETH addresses created in a week has increased in the past month, rising by almost one-third from around the same period last year, according to data from Santiment. "The amount of new weekly ETH addresses created is ranging around 800K-1M per week, compared to about one-third less at this point last year," wrote Santiment analysts in an X post on Wednesday. He noted that lawmakers should pass the bill "ASAP," with no further delays or adjustments. "This is American brilliance at its best, and we are going to show the world how to WIN with digital assets like never before," Trump said in a post on social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday. Most companies and banks are already looking to leverage stablecoins in their business operations, with notable examples including Apple, Amazon, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley, which are exploring stablecoin solutions. Debates among lawmakers regarding the crypto market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, which aims to establish a broader regulatory framework for digital assets, have also contributed to rising interest in Ethereum, which hosts the majority of crypto market activity outside of Bitcoin transactions. "This is going to start playing, turning blockchains into infrastructure. And once blockchains become infrastructure that the whole world's powered on, financial infrastructure and a variety of other applications — social, logistics, supply chain, etc. — then ETH becomes like the internet," said Ethrealize co-founder Vivek Raman in an exclusive interview with FXStreet. "ETH has underperformed for a long time mostly because we have been under regulatory purgatory. Now that all that is lifting, there's going to be a repricing at some point from 'tech play,' which is very limiting to store of value, global infrastructure like oil," he added. If it holds this level and sustains a move above its 200-day SMA, it could retest the channel's upper boundary resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) are moving sideways below their neutral levels, indicating a slightly dominant bearish momentum.

The adoption of cryptocurrency-related financial products, including tokenized treasuries, is on overdrive globally, with the focus now shifting to robust networks such as Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL). Bitcoin bulls step up, pushing the price above $106,000, as Trump said he would delay his decision about launching strikes on Iran for up to two weeks. Solana experiences a minor uptick of under 1% at press time on Friday, with multiple long shadow candles forming above $140 as bearish momentum fades off. Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled to a low of $101,095 on Friday amid volatility in the market. The effect of the tussle between United States (US) President Donald Trump and Tesla Chief Elon Musk negatively influenced the NASDAQ and Tesla's stock price on Thursday, although both are recovering on Friday.
