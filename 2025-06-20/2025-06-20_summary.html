Democrats recently ousted David Hogg from leadership after he criticized the party for complacency.

New polling finds that most Democratic voters want the current leaders of the Democratic Party to be replaced, as current leadership has failed to unite behind a coherent message to resist President Donald Trump's fascist power grab.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday found that 62 percent of self-identified Democrats said that the party should replace Democrats with new leaders, with only 24 percent disagreeing with that statement. A plurality of respondents, at 49 percent, said that they're unsatisfied with current leaders. 

The survey included over 4,200 respondents, including 1,293 Democrats, and was conducted earlier this month.

The poll comes at a time of crisis for the party. After Democrats suffered enormous losses in the 2024 election, many conservative and mainstream liberal analysts had pushed a false narrative that Democrats lost because they hadn't gone far enough to the right and embraced more of Republicans' outright fascist viewpoints.

This has consistently been shown to be untrue when voters have been surveyed about their views on key issues. Indeed, the Reuters/Ipsos polling suggested that Democrats want party leaders to go further left on a wide variety of economic and social issues.

For instance, roughly 4 in 5 Democrats or more said that they want the party to prioritize universal health care, affordable child care, and raising taxes on the rich. A smaller majority of respondents said that the party actually prioritizes such issues.

But in reality, the majority of federally elected Democrats actually oppose proposals like Medicare for All, and many party leaders have actively worked to sabotage support for such ideas. Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-Vermont) Medicare for All bill introduced this year, for instance, only had 15 cosponsors out of 47 Democrats in the caucus — Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (New York) not being one of them.

Far from taxing the rich, party leaders have also cozied up to billionaires — with some in the party recently suggesting that Democrats should court Elon Musk, friend of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, during his public breakup with President Donald Trump this month.

Schumer and other leaders like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have faced intense scrutiny in recent months in particular, with both leaders having been effectively absent as the Trump administration has escalated its violent and authoritarian tactics both domestically and worldwide. 

For instance, opposing war with Iran could be a major boon for Democrats, as the prospect is extremely unpopular among Americans, recent polls have found, who strongly favor diplomatic options. And yet, as Trump has threatened to directly declare war on Iran, Schumer and Jeffries have egged him on. Figures like Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, meanwhile, have been totally silent; Harris, after all, named Iran as the U.S.'s top enemy on the campaign trail last year.

The importance of opposing the war and embracing other left-leaning issues seems to be understood by one party leader, David Hogg — who, tellingly, was recently ousted from his position as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee after he criticized the party for its complacency in the face of the Trump administration.

“Any Democrat who supports this war with Iran needs to be primaried,” said Hogg on social media this week. “Our generation grew up going through two multi trillion dollar wars we should have never been involved in. We are not fucking going back to that. If you think this is a good idea, read a history book.”

A driver who got stuck on the Spanish Steps in Rome is the latest in a series of similar vehicular misadventures

The 1969 caper The Italian Job spawned a Hollywood remake, helped drive the cool-factor of the Mini and launched decades of dad jokes about bloody doors being blown off. It may also have inspired one driver who got stuck trying to travel down the Spanish Steps in Rome this week.

The film ended with Michael Caine teetering on the edge of a cliff in a coach, claiming to have a “great idea”. In Rome, the 80-year-old's navigational error on his way to work ended with emergency services having to bring in a crane to winch his vehicle off the Italian capital's landmark.

But it is not only in Rome where steps, or indeed navigational issues, can create havoc for drivers. In the slightly less celebrated surrounds of north London's Maitland Park estate, residents have been complaining about drivers getting their cars stuck trying to rehash one of the film's most famous scenes by driving down a small flight of steps.

According to the Camden New Journal, five cars met their match on the five concrete steps within the space of a month last year, with some of the drivers reportedly blaming their satnav apps for leading them there.

One resident, Aron Kennedy, posted online about the phenomenon, which he referred to as a “new Camden tourist attraction along with Karl Marx”. He told the paper: “If it happens one more time I think we might have to get a living statue of a car stuck there permanently.”

In Plymouth in 2017, it was reported that a driver turned off a road, through the gap in railings at a pedestrian crossing, across the pavement and through a covered walkway leading under a block of flats and a small supermarket, before parking the silver Vauxhall Corsa facing downwards on a flight of steps. All because the satnav had reportedly said to turn left at Tesco.

And so many lorries have got stuck following their satnavs down a narrow country lane in Cornwall that one man reportedly paid £150 for a large yellow sign that read, in block capitals: “Do not follow satnav. This route is unsuitable. You will get stuck.” According to a local newspaper report last month, this was not enough to stop it happening yet again.

In Somerset, by a 6ft-wide lane, stands a house that has reportedly sustained £50,000 of damage over several years from HGV drivers trying to force their way past while following directions on their devices.

And those are just domestic tales of driving woe. Driving when abroad can be particularly confusing. Guardian readers have been sharing some of their own experiences.

Otieno Okatch said he and his wife, from California, rented a car in Switzerland during the annual Fasnacht celebrations. “One day, we ended up in downtown Lucerne and got lost. The streets were oddly empty. We turned the corner and had inadvertently entered the city Fasnacht parade. We were mortified. A police escort had to help us get out as thousands stared at the two foreigners.”

Anand Ranganathan, also from California, told of an experience when he and his wife were in Arles, France, while touring the country about 14 years ago. Forced by hefty mobile roaming charges to follow printed-out Google Maps directions to their hotel, they were sent down a “one-lane road that had a retractable bollard in the middle of it”.

He said: “Only drivers who had a special code were allowed to go through it … Of course, we didn't realise this until we got close to the bollard. Now we were stuck. There was a line of cars behind us and a bollard in front of us … The cars behind us were honking, the driver immediately behind us was cursing us in well-considered French, and I was standing there gesticulating to indicate that I was but a lost tourist.”

To stairs in London and Devon, and narrow lanes in Cornwall and Bouches-du-Rhône, add for one driver a picturesque flight of steps in the heart of the Italian capital.

            The Supreme Court on Friday revived a lawsuit from fuel producers challenging California's strict vehicle emission rules, allowing the companies to fight an on-again, off-again climate policy that President Donald Trump has previously opposed.
    


            Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a 7-2 majority. Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.
    


            “The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” Kavanaugh wrote.
    


            While the federal government generally sets vehicle emission standards, the Environmental Protection Agency has at times granted a waiver to California – because of its longstanding air-quality problems – to set tougher standards. Given the state's size, automakers have long hewed to its tighter emissions controls even for cars sold in other states.
    


            That waiver was challenged by Diamond Alternative Energy, a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation, and several other companies and groups that advocate on behalf of fuel manufacturers.
    


            Although the fuel producers challenged the waiver itself, the Supreme Court specifically declined to review that question, denying an appeal in December that raised that issue. Instead, the only issue before the justices was whether the companies and trade associations had standing to sue.
    


            A federal appeals court in Washington, DC, concluded that market forces are driving the national push toward electric vehicles far more than California's tough regulations. Given that, the court ruled that the fuel makers could not proceed with the case.
    


            One of the factors a party must demonstrate to establish standing is redressability, which essentially means that the court's order can actually fix the problem the plaintiffs have raised. California said that even if courts eliminate the waiver, it wouldn't help the fuel producers because consumer demand was motivating people to buy electric vehicles on their own.
    


            During oral arguments, both conservative and liberal justices seemed to be skeptical of that position, noting that the EPA had pointed to a reduced reliance on fossil fuels as part of the justification for the waiver.

            Perhaps sensing a win in their case, the fuel producers advocated for a categorical rule that would have made it easier for companies challenging the federal government to sue over similar decisions in the future.
    


            It's not clear how much practical impact the court's decision will have. Trump seems almost certain to withdraw the waiver, just as he did during his first administration. The waiver was later reinstated by President Joe Biden.
    


            That is a point that Jackson zeroed in on in her dissent.
    


            “President Trump rescinded this exact same waiver the last time he was in office,” Jackson wrote. “Because a withdrawal of the waiver would moot this case, an obvious question arises: Why would this court rush to opine on whether the fuel industry's legal challenge” can proceed “when all involved – including petitioners themselves – believe that any such ‘case' or ‘controversy' will soon vanish?”
    


            Jackson said she worried that allowing the fuel producers to sue now would make it easier for other groups to challenge the Clean Air Act in the future.
    


            California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said he was disappointed in the decision but will continue fighting the case.
    


            “Congress intended for California to be able to regulate emissions from new vehicles sold in our state, and we remain firmly committed to advancing and implementing strong standards that safeguard public health and reduce climate pollution,” he said.
    


            The conservative Supreme Court has repeatedly sided against the EPA and environmental groups in past cases. Last year, the court upended a Biden administration effort to reduce smog and air pollution wafting across state lines. In 2023, the justices cut back on the EPA's ability to regulate wetlands under the Clean Water Act.

Editor's Note: This story was updated with comments from Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said "all of Ukraine" belonged to Russia in a speech on June 20 at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, amid increasingly aggressive official statements about Moscow's final territorial ambitions in Ukraine.

Putin's claim was based on the false narrative often pushed both by himself as leader and by Russian propaganda that Russians and Ukrainians are "one people."

The narrative has long figured prominently in Putin's rhetoric, often brought up as justification for its aggression in Ukraine.

In July 2021, just half a year before the full-scale invasion, the Russian leader stoked fears of a larger attack when he wrote and published an essay on the "historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians." 

In response to the speech in St Petersburg, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha condemned Putin's comments as "cynical," saying it showed “complete disregard for U.S. peace efforts."

"While the United States and the rest of the world have called for an immediate end to the killing, Russia's top war criminal discusses plans to seize more Ukrainian territory and kill more Ukrainians," he wrote in a post on X.

Putin made several other statements at the forum, some contradictory, about Moscow's aims in the war going forward.

"Wherever the foot of a Russian soldier steps is Russian land," Putin said, directly implying Russia's intention to continue occupying more than just the five Ukrainian regions that Moscow has illegally laid claim to: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, as well as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. 

Sybiha said that "Russian soldier's foot" brings only "death, destruction, and devastation." He accused Putin of indifference toward his own troops, calling him “a mass murderer of his own people.”

"He already disposed one million Russian soldiers in a senseless bloodbath in Ukraine without achieving a single strategic goal. One million soldiers. Two million feet," the minister said.

"And, while Putin is busy sending Russian feet to invade other countries, he is bringing Russians inside the country to their knees economically."

As per the "peace memorandum" presented by the Russian delegation at the last round of peace talks in Istanbul on June 2, Moscow demands Kyiv recognize the oblasts as Russian and hand over all territory not yet controlled by Russian forces into occupation, including the regional capitals of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

Asked whether Russia aimed to seize the regional center of Sumy in Ukraine's northeast, Putin said that while such a mission has not been assigned, he wouldn't rule it out.

Russian ground attacks into Sumy Oblast have intensified along the northeastern border in the past weeks, having first crossed the border after Ukraine's withdrawal from most of its positions in Kursk Oblast in March.

Russian troops have moved 10-12 kilometers (6-8 miles) deep into the region, according to Putin.

"The city of Sumy is next, the regional center. We don't have a task to take Sumy, but I don't rule it out," Putin said.

Sybiha urged the West to ramp up military aid to Ukraine, tighten sanctions against Russia, designate Moscow a terrorist state, and "isolate it fully."

"His cynical statements serve only one purpose: to divert public attention away from the complete failure of his quarter-century rule," the minister added.

Since March, Russia has reportedly taken control of about 200 square kilometers (80 square miles) in northern Sumy Oblast, including roughly a dozen small villages, according to open-source conflict mapping projects. 

As of May 31, mandatory evacuations had been ordered for 213 settlements.

In May, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to create a so-called "security buffer zone" along the border with Ukraine, while Zelensky said on May 28 that Moscow had massed 50,000 troops near Sumy.

In a separate interview with Bild on June 12, Zelensky dismissed Moscow's claims of significant territorial gains as "a Russian narrative" aimed at shaping global perceptions. He stressed that Ukrainian forces have managed to hold off a renewed offensive for nearly three weeks.

When asked if Moscow requires the complete capitulation of Kyiv and the Ukrainian leadership, Putin denied this, saying that Russia instead demands the "recognition of the realities on the ground."

The statement follows a consistent line from Russian officials since the return of U.S. President Donald Trump brought new momentum to the idea of a quick negotiated peace in Ukraine. 

Projecting a winning position on the battlefield and gaining confidence from Trump's frequent anti-Ukrainian rhetoric and refusal to approve further military aid to Kyiv, Moscow has stuck to maximalist demands, refusing the joint U.S.-Ukraine proposal of a 30-day unconditional ceasefire along the front line.

On June 18, in an interview to CNN, Russian ambassador to the U.K. Andrei Kelin said that while Russian forces were advancing on the battlefield and taking more Ukrainian, there was no incentive to stop, and that Kyiv must either accept Moscow's peace terms now or "surrender" after losing much more.

One expert has warned that attacks on nuclear facilities “should never take place” because of the radioactive fallout.

The Pentagon has reportedly assessed that the only weapon that could destroy a nuclear facility in Iran deemed by war hawks to be a key part of Iran's nuclear program is a nuclear bomb — an intensely ironic finding in a war fought over the pretense of stopping nuclear proliferation.

According to U.S. sources cited by The Guardian, defense officials have been told that only a “tactical nuclear weapon” could penetrate deep enough underground to destroy Fordow, a nuclear facility reportedly built inside a mountain in northwestern Iran.

Officials have been discussing using GBU-57s, which are 30,000-pound bombs, to penetrate the facility. This would require the U.S. military to directly strike Iran in a major escalation, as Israel does not possess the bombs or the stealth bomber required to carry out the strike.

On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump has said that he will decide within the next two weeks whether he will instruct the military to strike Iran.

President Donald Trump is not considering using a nuclear weapon, The Guardian reported on Wednesday, and it has not been presented as a possibility by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth or by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine. 

Though it hasn't been presented to the president, the assessment made by the Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which specializes in studying weapons of mass destruction, is seemingly on the minds of some defense officials; the efficacy of GBU-57s has reportedly been a topic of “deep contention” among defense officials since the beginning of Trump's term. 

A tactical nuclear weapon has never been used before, and could have disastrous results, causing radioactive nuclear fallout and likely escalating and normalizing the use of nuclear weapons in war. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, warned on Friday that attacks on nuclear facilities like Fordow “should never take place” because of the potential fallout within the country.

That such a possibility would even be considered is a show of the glaring double standard of Israel's U.S.-backed war with Iran — where two of only a handful of nuclear powers in the world would consider it a legitimate act of war to use a nuclear bomb to stop Iran from having one.

At the same time, however, direct attacks on Iran by the U.S. would likely only push Iranian officials into developing a nuclear weapon, rather than deterring them. 

It is a somewhat common sense conclusion that Iran would want to intensify its war capabilities if it's facing an assault by two of the most powerful militaries on earth. It is also the conclusion made by top U.S. intelligence officials, The New York Times has reported, citing such officials.

“Senior U.S. intelligence officials said that Iranian leaders were likely to shift toward producing a bomb if the American military attacked the Iranian uranium enrichment site Fordo or if Israel killed Iran's supreme leader,” the Times reported on Thursday. Over the years, U.S. aggression against non-nuclear powers has incentivized targeted nations to go nuclear.

The publication also said that the fact that numerous groups and officials have assessed that Iran is not actively working toward a nuclear weapon is “irrelevant” to some American and Israeli officials — despite Israel's entire stated pretense for the war. Indeed, on Tuesday, Trump said “I don't care” that the U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Iran isn't building a nuclear weapon, according to his own top intelligence official.

			White House announces US president has shortened trip to meet world leaders

Donald Trump will spend as little time as possible on European soil next week when he heads to a crucial Nato summit for just 24 hours.

He was set to arrive in The Hague on Monday evening before returning to Washington on Wednesday, but the White House says he will now arrive on Tuesday.

A week after he left a meeting of the G7 in Canada early, apparently irritated at having to sit through a meeting on wildfires when his mind was on the Middle East, it will raise fears among allies that he has no time for the sorts of summits that underpin international diplomacy.

Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said the shortened trip was not a snub, but a reflection of how Nato has tightened the schedule.

“The president is a man of efficiency. He wants to get things done,” she said. “More action, less talk.”

Mr Trump has expressed his irritation with Nato in the past, even threatening to withdraw the US in protest at the way allies were shirking spending targets.

But relations have improved in recent years as member states have accepted Mr Trump's arguments.

His new schedule means he will still arrive in time for a leaders' dinner and will attend a session devoted to discussing allies' efforts to spend the equivalent of five percent of their gross domestic product on defence.

“He wants to see that happen,” said Ms Leavitt.

At the same time, the tight turnaround reflects Mr Trump's impatience with big, multilateral groups.

The president upended this week's G7 summit in Kananaski, Canada, hurrying home on Monday night to deal with the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran.

He had hinted at his frustration as he addressed the media beside Sir Keir Starmer during the afternoon.

He was asked about the chances of reaching a deal with Iran and said: “As soon as we leave here we are going to do something. But I have to leave here. I have, you know, this commitment. I have a lot of commitments.”

With the Middle East in flames, he then had to sit through a session on tackling wildfires.

A former White House official said: “He already thinks these meetings are a waste of time. I think you can see the timeline of a wildfire meeting followed by the announcement that he was leaving and draw your own conclusions.”

Nato had already accounted for Mr Trump's mercurial nature, condensing its format from three sessions to a single two-and-a-half-hour meeting.

Ms Leavitt said the president's travel plans simply reflected that shift.

“Nato has shortened its schedule,” she said. “The president is rolling with the schedule that Nato has given us.”

Organisers have shortened the summit and drafted an abbreviated joint statement in part to avoid a repeat of Mr Trump's last Nato meeting. In 2019, he left early, abandoning a planned press conference after other leaders were caught on camera joking about him.

Brett Bruen, a former Obama official and president of the Global Situation Room, said the shortened trips were “becoming a pattern.”

“He may not want to sit through a session on wildfires but it is the prerogative of the host of any of these summits to decide the agenda,” he said.

More to the point, side meetings and other interactions were the place where a lot of business got done.

He said: “If we are no longer to use summits for substance then I think it begs the question: Where else are leaders getting together?”

            A federal judge in Rhode Island blocked the Trump administration from using states' cooperation with immigration efforts as a condition for receiving transportation funds.
    


            US District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction to 20 mostly Democratic-led states that filed a lawsuit last month to prevent the Department of Transportation from cutting off billions of dollars in funding if the states refused to comply with federal immigration enforcement.
    


            In his Thursday ruling, McConnell, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, said, “Congress did not authorize or grant authority to the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars specifically appropriated for transportation purposes.”
    


            The ruling is the latest legal setback for President Donald Trump's administration. Many state attorneys general have sued over issues ranging from the president's bid to end birthright citizenship to his tariff policies.
    


            The president has used federal funding as leverage amid policy disagreements with different states and organizations. He threatened to withhold funds from California over a transgender athlete's participation in a sporting event and to cut off $3 billion in federal grant funding for Harvard University over its handling of anti-Israel protests.
    


            In his ruling, McConnell wrote that the immigration-enforcement condition on the funding “is arbitrary and capricious in its scope and lacks specificity in how the States are to cooperate on immigration enforcement in exchange for Congressionally appropriated transportation dollars–grant money that the States rely on to keep their residents safely and efficiently on the road, in the sky, and on the rails.”
    


            Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement Friday the department will keep fighting the issue in court.
    


            “I directed states who want federal DOT money to comply with federal immigration laws. But, no surprise, an Obama-appointed judge has ruled that states can openly defy our federal immigration laws. This is judicial activism pure & simple and I will continue to fight in the courts,” Duffy wrote.
    


            Earlier this week, Duffy wrote in a social media post that the department “will NOT fund rogue state actors who refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.”
    


            The lawsuit was brought by California, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
    


            California's Attorney General Rob Bonta praised the court's decision and criticized Trump for using funds “as a bargaining chip.”
    


            “It's immoral – and more importantly, illegal. I'm glad to see the District Court agrees, blocking the President's latest attempt to circumvent the Constitution and coerce state and local governments into doing his bidding while we continue to make our case in court,” Bonta said in a statement on Thursday.

            As one of the City of Angels' first major professional sports teams, the Dodgers are a cornerstone of Southern California culture. Their interlocking LA logo is as iconic as the Hollywood sign, recognized around the world and worn as a symbol of pride by millions of Angelenos.
    


            In times of crisis, teams like the Dodgers are usually a rallying point – a unifying force in moments of struggle. But over the last few weeks, as major protests popped up in Los Angeles in response to increased immigration raids by the Trump administration in the Southern California area, the Dodgers became a target of local ire. It was a tough demotion from being the subject of local adoration just months ago during a World Series championship parade.



On June 6, raids outside a Home Depot and an apparel warehouse in Los Angeles set off days of protests and, on some nights, clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. President Donald Trump on June 7 deployed National Guard troops to the city to “temporarily protect ICE” – the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement – “and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions” and to protect federal property, according to a memo – overriding California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who called the move a “brazen abuse of power.”

Los Angeles Dodgers and Trump administration at odds over presence of federal agents at Dodger Stadium



            Families have been split, people were arrested by plain-clothes agents wearing masks and hats and Trump and his administration reveled in the chance to clash with Democratic politicians. As fear spread throughout Los Angeles, many of the city's institutions spoke up to defend the undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers who were being picked up by the federal government.
    


            But not the Dodgers. The team – whose stadium itself is part of the long story of the Latino experience in Los Angeles, given that the land on which it sits was once home to a Mexican-American neighborhood that fought for years against being displaced – was publicly quiet about the tension gripping its city.
    


            That silence infuriated many members of the fanbase, who felt abandoned by their team.
    


            “I just feel like the organization, as a whole, needed to say something. The fanbase is predominantly Latinos, and we have been supporting them forever,” said Amanda Carrera, a Dodgers fan who was demonstrating outside of Dodger Stadium on Thursday.
    


            A few dozen people were also protesting as the Dodgers played the San Diego Padres. They shouted to keep “ICE out of LA” and “ICE out of Dodger Stadium.” Many expressed anger toward the Dodger organization for remaining silent on the issue plaguing a core part of their fanbase. “And so why should we keep supporting them if they don't support us?” Carrera asked. “And, as heartbreaking as it sounds, it's like we love our team so much and it just feels like they don't love us.”
    


            It was against that backdrop that federal law enforcement arrived just outside the vast Dodger Stadium parking lot on Thursday.
    


            Reports began to circulate that federal agents were present at the stadium outside downtown LA, sparking concerns that the Trump administration's immigration crackdown was coming to the home of the World Series champions hours before a game against the San Diego Padres. Protesters rushed to the area and began chanting anti-ICE slogans at the federal agents.
    


            In the team's telling, agents from ICE arrived at Dodger Stadium and asked for permission to access the parking lots. The Dodgers said no.
    

This morning, ICE agents came to Dodger Stadium and requested permission to access the parking lots. They were denied entry to the grounds by the organization. Tonight's game will be played as scheduled.


            The Trump administration's version of what happened is quite different. US Customs and Border Protection vehicles were in a parking lot on the grounds, and one of them had a car malfunction that caused them to stay longer, according to an official who maintained there were no operations related to the MLB franchise.
    


            The ICE account on X even called out the Dodgers directly, saying their post was false.
    


            “We were never there,” the post read.
    


            There has been an influx of CBP agents in the Los Angeles area on the heels of the protests against Trump's immigration enforcement agenda. The Department of Homeland Security surged agency personnel to the region, including border agents, to respond to those protests and many have remained in the area.
    


            “This had nothing to do with the Dodgers. CBP vehicles were in the stadium parking lot very briefly, unrelated to any operation or enforcement,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
    


            An Echo Park Rapid Response community activist, who did not want to be named, told CNN that early Thursday morning, members of the community signaled “what they called a really heavy ICE presence at the Home Depot in Hollywood,” so they headed that way.
    


            The activist said they saw two people being detained at a Home Depot and followed the vehicles in which the detainees were taken away to near Dodger Stadium.
    


            They saw a CBP agent, the activist said, whom they had also seen and spoken to at the Home Depot. “I asked what they were doing. He responded that they bring the detainees there (near Dodger Stadium) to process them,” the activist said. “They conduct their investigation there without public interference, (…) that they can't do it in the Home Depot parking lot because the public makes it too dangerous.”
    


            CNN has contacted CBP and ICE for clarification regarding the community member's description of events.
    


            No matter the agency or their purpose, the appearance of federal agents at Dodger Stadium is enough to create a high-profile event, given the atmosphere that is gripping Los Angeles.
    


            Some businesses have been closing early, with more customers staying home. As the school year wound down, some students wept openly in class, worried about the future of their families. Relatives stayed away from graduation ceremonies, while some nannies chose to stay close to their employers' homes, only taking the children around the block instead of public parks.
    


            Rumors of where ICE will be or how it will be meeting the White House's demands for more arrests have been rife, not just in LA but around the country. With the FIFA Club World Cup attracting soccer fans to stadiums throughout the US, there have been worries that federal agents could target people coming to the games.
    


            So, when reports of federal agents being outside Dodger Stadium began to circulate on Thursday, protesters flocked to the team's complex just outside of downtown Los Angeles. Images from the parking lot outside the stadium showed a line of police blocking protesters from being near the large group of unmarked federal law enforcement vehicles that had gathered in the stadium's expansive concrete apron.
    


With the White House expecting ICE to arrest 3,000 people per day and Los Angeles-area officials telling the public that they don't have any idea where federal agents will pop up next, the entire area is on edge.
    


            Carerra said she's organizing a protest later this week and she hears mixed things about whether people actually want to be in public.
    


            “The community has voted to protest. They want to come out and do it, but I think that there is the other half that's scared,” she said.
    


            “It's scary when you see images and videos of people being kidnapped. You know, I mean, ICE agents, unmarked vehicles, masks covering their face. … We don't even know who to trust. We don't know, like, are these actually, actual agents or not, you know? So, there's a lot of fear. It's horrible. It's so just heartbreaking.”
    


            That tension meant many fans lashed out at the Dodgers for not having done more to express support for their fans, many of whom are Latino. The replies to the Dodgers' X account were full of fans demanding the team say something condemning the federal government's actions or – at the very least – express support for the immigrant community in LA.
    


            Vice President JD Vance will travel Friday to Los Angeles, where he'll tour a multi-agency Federal Joint Operations Center before meeting with leadership and Marines and delivering remarks, the White House announced.
    


            The vice president is the highest-ranking administration official to travel to Los Angeles since protests roiled the city following ICE raids and troop deployments earlier this month.
    


            Al Aguilar, who was standing outside Dodger Stadium with a sign that read “Los Doyers Silent? Silent” on Thursday afternoon, said the team's history in LA should make it more understanding of the pressure on the community.
    


            He said the Dodgers buying the Chavez Ravine land at a discounted price and the eviction of the final families remaining on the land came with the stipulation that the stadium would be used for the community. He said Latinos largely stayed away from the team until Fernandomania – the debut of Dodger legend Fernando Valenzuela and his subsequent success – in 1981 made fans for life.
    


            That history isn't forgotten today, he said.
    


            “Nothing was said. They were silent about the issues going on, not even taking sides. They could say, ‘We believe in equal rights, constitutional rights, due process,' without taking sides, just those things, but they didn't say anything,” Aguilar told CNN.
    


            He added, “With the amount of Latin American players that they have, with the community being behind them all these years, being (forgiven) – if you were thrown out of your houses and dragged out for a sports franchise that interrupted the community, you might have feelings about that.”
    


            When singer Nezza performed the National Anthem ahead of a game last weekend, as “No Kings” protests were taking place around the nation and LA was enduring another weekend of protests, she decided to do so in Spanish. What sparked more outrage against the Dodgers was the fact that she said a Dodgers employee specifically asked her not to.
    


            “I didn't really see an issue with it and I wanted people to know that I'm with them and I'm standing by them,” Nezza told CNN on Tuesday.
    


            An unidentified person, who Nezza says is a Dodgers employee, can be heard on a video saying to the singer, “We are going to do the song in English today, so I'm not sure if that wasn't relayed.”
    


            Following her performance, the Dodgers employee – who she would not name – called Nezza's manager almost immediately and told them to never call or email them again, and that their client was not welcome back, according to the singer.
    


            The Dodgers have said publicly that there are “no consequences or hard feelings” regarding her performance and that she is not banned from – and welcome to return to – the stadium.
    


            Nezza, whose parents are both immigrants, said she hasn't been contacted by the team and doesn't plan on attending the stadium again.
    


            “I don't feel welcome to come back,” she said.
    


            Carerra said that attitude from the team confused and angered many fans.
    


            “That's kind of what's been the confusion because they have spoken out against or regarding other social issues before,” she told CNN. “They've made statements before about things, and so, you know, the fact that it's taking them this long is just, it's very confusing, and it hurts.”
    


            That frustration with the organization could ease among fans after Thursday's confrontation with the Trump administration.
    


            The back and forth with the administration came on the same day that the team was expected to release a statement on how it plans to support immigrants in the Los Angeles area affected by the immigration crackdown.
    


            Gary Lee, the founder of DodgersNation.com, said silence is the Dodgers' “default position” on the immigration crackdown, but the plan for an announcement by the team on how it plans to assist immigrants in the area was a relief.
    


            “The Dodgers have arguably been more culturally influential to the city of Los Angeles” than other sports franchises, Lee said, “so there seems to be more responsibility to the community on their shoulders than any other franchise, including the Lakers.”
    


            But after Thursday's incident with federal agents, the planned announcement didn't materialize.
    


            For some fans, the damage is done regardless of what the team says. Carerra told CNN that the amount of public pressure on the Dodgers has her questioning the team in ways she never would have before. Even if the Dodgers made a strong statement of support or really threw federal agents off Dodger Stadium property on Thursday, she's now wondering if it's all a public relations move.
    


            “It's like, can we even trust them? Like, can we trust them up to this point that what they're doing isn't just to kind of, you know, protect themselves, and that sucks. I hate that it has to get to this point,” she said.
    


CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to note that the Dodgers were not the first major professional sports team in Los Angeles.

Senator from Massachusetts questions state department's redirection of $500m to troubled organization

US politics live – latest updates

Elizabeth Warren has confronted the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, over reports that the state department is considering redirecting $500m from USAID to the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

In a letter addressed to Rubio and USAID's acting administrator, Kenneth Jackson, the Massachusetts senator argued that the GHF, a self-proclaimed aid organisation that is backed by the Israeli and US governments, “marks an alarming departure from the professional humanitarian organizations that have worked on the ground, in Gaza and elsewhere, for decades”.

“The questions surrounding GHF – its funding sources and connection to the Trump Administration, its use of private contractors, its ability to serve and be seen as a neutral entity, its abandonment by its founders, and its basic competence in providing aid – must be answered before the State Department commits any funding to the organization,” Warren wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided exclusively to the Guardian.

The letter from Warren requested answers by 2 July on whether USAID is considering awarding any funds to the GHF, the terms of a possible agreement and the GHF's connections to the Boston Consulting Group, which reportedly helped set up the group's operations. BCG canceled its cooperation with the GHF after the organisation was embroiled in controversy following a series of shootings by Israeli forces at its food distribution sites.

Reuters first reported that funds directed to USAID, which is being rolled into the state department, could be rerouted to the GHF in an important boost to a troubled organisation that opened food distribution centres in Gaza last month. The GHF has struggled to partner with major aid organisations, even as Israeli and US officials have put pressure on NGOs to route their humanitarian through the GHF or face having no access to Gaza at all.

Major aid organisations have boycotted the GHF, which was forced to temporarily close some of its food distribution centres shortly after its launch last month due to security concerns. Israeli forces have opened fired into crowds near the food distribution sites several times in mass casualty events that Israeli officials have said took place in self-defence. Hundreds of Gazans have been killed.

Jake Wood, the former executive director of the GHF, resigned last month shortly before operations began. He said that he could not guarantee the organisation's “independence” from political influence. Critics have argued that the GHF is a tool for the Israeli and US governments to politicise humanitarian aid and to distribute it in ways that will depopulate sectors of Gaza in apparent violation of international law.

The Guardian has approached the state department for comment.

Top chefs in this year's World Region of Gastronomy are looking back as they shift from avant-garde cuisine to something more homespun 

They revolutionised cooking worldwide with radical techniques and a highly technical cuisine of playful trompe l'oeil – but now many disciples of Catalonia's iconoclastic chef Ferran Adrià believe it's time to get back to their roots.

Catalonia has been named World Region of Gastronomy 2025 by the International Institute of Gastronomy, Culture, Arts and Tourism and later this month 60 Michelin-starred chefs will launch a campaign to position Catalonia as a unique and exceptional gastronomic destination.

While not rejecting the techniques of so-called molecular gastronomy introduced by Adrià at his restaurant El Bulli, with its foams, spherification and liquid nitrogen, the emphasis will be on local produce and the region's gastronomic culture. El Bulli closed in 2011.

“Copying El Bulli is over. Now it's become a huge repertoire of techniques that each person can apply to their cooking,” said Jordi Artal, chef at the two-starred Cinc Sentits in Barcelona. “I wouldn't say there's a backlash; it's part of the natural ebb and flow. We use modern techniques but in ways that hark back to Catalan gastronomic history. That's the ideal.”

Artal said there had always been a schism between those who believe you should only cook what's in season and Adrià saying: “I'm an artist, find me the world's best cherry in January so I can make my dish.”

Carme Ruscalleda said: “The concept may have changed but my cooking has always been based in the Mediterranean and its produce.” The chef was speaking in her home town of Sant Pol de Mar, next door to the restaurant where she won the first of seven Michelin stars. “We must embrace new ideas without losing sight of who we are. Catalan cuisine has Roman and Greek and medieval roots. We make many dishes that are basically medieval but with modern techniques.”

This year chefs such as the Roca brothers in Girona and Jordi Vilà in Barcelona have opened – running alongside their flagship restaurants – more modest establishments where they offer more traditional dishes.

“We are taking a broad but not a simplified view of Catalan cuisine,” said Joan Roca about Fontané, the brothers' latest venture, where prices are well below those of El Celler de Can Roca, twice voted the best restaurant in the world.

Vilà, chef at one-starred Alkimia and the more homespun Al Kostat del Mar, said: “Joan Roca and Carme Ruscalleda have always cooked Catalan food but what happened was that what became important was what we call cocina vanguardista [avant-garde cuisine], when what really matters is to use local produce and express yourself in your cooking.

“Many young chefs don't aspire to be Joan Roca or Ferran Adrià but want to cook the dishes their mothers or grandmothers made.”

Tradition doesn't always come cheap, however. The tasting menus at high-end restaurants such as El Celler de Can Roca cost upwards of €200 (£170), without wine.

Oriol Castro, one of three chefs – all ex-El Bulli – behind Disfrutar, voted best restaurant in the world last year, said no one expected people to pay those sorts of prices for basic Catalan dishes.

“In Disfrutar we offer many dishes based on traditional recipes, with new techniques but traditional flavours, such as a suquet de peix [fish and potato stew] or mar i muntanya [seafood and rabbit or chicken casserole],” said Castro, who insists there is no backlash against the El Bulli school of cooking.

“People come here to eat modern, creative versions of traditional dishes. What's important is the combination of creativity and tradition. There isn't a war. All of us want to preserve this tradition.”

Artal said that while he was no purist, in keeping with his principles there were only Catalan and Spanish wines on his wine list. “I can't explain to a customer that a dish was inspired by my great-grandmother and that we're using locally sourced ingredients and then serve a wine from Bordeaux,” he said. “I love yuzu but there's no yuzu on the menu because I couldn't say my grandmother used yuzu.”

Everyday Catalan cuisine may be in good health outside Barcelona but in the capital it's far easier to find ramen, sushi, hamburgers or pizza than traditional fare.

“I'm not against ramen or hamburgers, I'm against globalization,” said Vilà, who has published a humorous “self-defence manual” for Catalan cooking. “Here there are 50 ramen places and none that serve escudella,” a traditional Catalan stew containing pasta or noodles.

Ruscalleda said: “Young people are attracted to the new, so they order sushi or ceviche but they don't know about their own culture.” She shares the view that the biggest threat to traditional cuisine everywhere is that people have stopped cooking at home.

In the meantime, it seems it is up to the culinary elite to maintain tradition, a paradox that Vilà accepts.

“We're in a transition because the grandmothers of the future don't want to stay at home cooking, they want to be out in the world,” he said. “Obviously, a top chef is no substitute for a grandmother, but it's up to us keep the tradition alive.”

            As US President Donald Trump weighs joining Israel's assault on Iran, questions are mounting over whether such an intervention could trigger regime change in Tehran – an outcome that risks splintering the country and sending shockwaves across the region.
    


            Home to long-simmering separatist movements that have vied for power and independence, Iran could face internal fragmentation and chaos if its government falls, experts warn.
    


            After reportedly rejecting an Israeli plan to kill Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Trump stated this week that Iran's Supreme Leader is an “easy target.”
    


            “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Tuesday. “He is an easy target but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out targeting Khamenei either, saying that the death of the Supreme Leader is “not going to escalate the conflict, it's going to end the conflict.”
    


            On Thursday, Defense Minister Israel Katz went further, declaring that Khamenei cannot be allowed to “continue to exist” after an Iranian missile struck a hospital in Israel.
    


            Iran is a nation of more than 90 million people and home one of the world's oldest continuous civilizations. Its borders have remained more or less stable for about 100 years. The Islamic Republic has managed to preserve those frontiers despite a diverse population of ethnic and religious groups, many of whom have sought autonomy at various points.
    


            But the comments from Israeli and US officials have prompted speculation over what Iran might look like if Khamenei is killed – with experts warning that the country could face a range of scenarios, including regime collapse or even civil war.
    


            The 86-year-old cleric has ruled Iran for more than 35 years as its highest authority, rising to power a decade after the 1979 Islamic Revolution overthrew a US-backed monarch.
    


            Over the years, he consolidated power and ruled with an iron grip under strict Islamic law. He crushed wave after wave of protests demanding social freedoms – each with increasing ferocity – and expanded Iran's reach far beyond its borders through a network of proxy militias.
    


            With his fate in question, attention is turning to who might succeed him, and how that uncertainty could unleash greater unrest.
    


            The Supreme Leader is elected by the 88-member Assembly of Experts for life and doesn't officially name a successor. It is unclear who might replace Khamenei, but that process may take place as separatist groups who have long resented the Islamic Republic seek to take advantage of what they may see as an opportunity.
    


            Israel has already killed several of Iran's key military figures, and experts say that the regime is now at its weakest.
    


            Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, said that regime change would require Israel or the United States having a figure in mind to replace Khamenei and send troops to the country.
    


            The figure Israel is likely to favor is Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of the deposed Iranian monarch who was ousted in 1979. Pahlavi has voiced support for Israel's actions, drawing praise from some in the Iranian diaspora and accusations of betrayal from many others.
    


            “Soon in Tehran,” Israeli Minister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli posted on X on Friday, along with a picture of himself shaking hands with a smiling Pahlavi. Pahlavi told BBC News on Sunday that Israel's conflict with Iran was an opportunity to bring down the Iranian regime.
    


            If the Supreme Leader is killed and the Guardian Council delays naming a successor, the risk of instability could grow, experts say.
    


            A possible outcome of Khamenei's potential killing is total regime collapse, Parsi said.
    


            “Regime collapse is just to collapse the state, and let the chaos that ensues fester,” Parsi told CNN.
    


            Several scenarios could ensue if the Iranian regime falls, none of which is expected to be to the liking of the US or neighboring states, experts said.
    


            Hamed Mousavi, associate professor of International Relations at the University of Tehran, warned that military intervention “rarely leads to democratization.”

            “Look at the experience of Iraq and Afghanistan… Both countries were unstable for many years,” Mousavi told CNN, adding that Iran is “even more complicated” than those nations.
    


            One outcome could be that other elements in the Iranian military assume power. They are unlikely to seek diplomatic routes with Israel or the US, but could take a more hawkish approach that sees possession of a nuclear bomb as the only deterrent to more attacks, Parsi said.
    


            Military factions that could take over are “not going to be the type of regime that the US may have had in mind,” Parsi said.
    


            Another possible scenario is descent into chaos, as Iran's multiple ethnic groups vie for power.
    


            Iran has a diverse population, including Persians, Azeris, Arabs, Baloch and Kurds. Under Khamenei's decades-long rule, the Islamic Republic largely managed to contain civil and ethnic unrest, despite the mistreatment faced by some groups.
    


            Minorities   faced discrimination in “their access to education, employment, adequate housing and political office,” according to Amnesty International last year. “Continued underinvestment in regions populated by ethnic minorities exacerbated poverty and marginalization,” it said.
    


            Azeris make up around 16% of Iran's overall population, according to Minority Rights Group. The Shiite group is the largest and most well-integrated minority in the Islamic Republic but has nonetheless faced inequity.
    


            Arabs constitute up to 4 million people, and they have also been subjected to marginalization over the years.
    


            A group of tribes speaking the Balochi language, the Baloch people make up nearly 5 million of Iran's population. The predominantly Sunni group extends into neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan, raising the possibility of separatist conflict spilling over the borders.
    


            The “Army of Justice” organization, a Baloch Sunni militant group, has shown support for Israel's strikes on Iran, saying in a statement: “It is clear that the current attack is not on Iran, but on the Velayat-e-Faqih (ruling) regime , it is God's will that the ground has been prepared for us, the people of Iran, to make the best use of this vacuum.”
    


            Kurds make up some 10% of Iran's population and are mostly settled along the borders with Iraq and Turkey. They have been subject to “deep-rooted discrimination,” Amnesty said.

            The Kurdistan Freedom Party, a nationalist and separatist militant group in Iran, published a statement backing Israel's strikes, saying it supports “the process of destroying Iran's military and security capabilities.”
    


            A Kurdish rebellion in Iran would also be a major concern for neighboring Iraq and Turkey, both of which have large Kurdish minorities that have sought independence.
    


            Another exiled group that has garnered support from US conservatives is the Mujahadin-e Khalq (MeK), a shadowy dissident group that was once a US-designated terrorist organization but today counts prominent anti-Iran politicians as key allies. Iran accuses it of terrorism, saying it carried out a series of attacks in the 1980s. The MeK denies those charges.
    


            It is one of the best-organized opposition groups confronting the Islamic Republic, but it has little support among Iranians, largely due to its violent past and for having supported Iraqi President Saddam Hussein during his almost decade-long war with Iran.
    


            If Iran's regime falls, “there would be support for ethnic separatist groups by the Israelis, and perhaps the US,” Parsi said. This would lead to a situation where remnants of the state are going to be consumed with fighting separatists.
    


            Fatemeh Haghighatjoo, executive director of the Nonviolent Initiative for Democracy and a former Iranian lawmaker who opposes the current regime, expressed fears that Iran may descend into civil conflict if the current rule falls.
    


            “I would like to get rid of this regime. I am the opposition,” she told CNN's Becky Anderson. “My main concern is… I see the signs (of) civil war.”

Michelle Obama has said she is “so glad” she did not have a son because he would have turned out like her husband, Barack Obama.

The former first lady made the comments on a podcast amid rumours of tension in the couple's relationship, although she has denied claims that they are on the verge of divorce.

“I'm so glad I didn't have a boy because he would have been a Barack Obama,” Mrs Obama, who has two daughters, Sasha and Malia, said on a podcast she hosts with her brother Craig Robinson on Wednesday.

Angie Martinez, a radio personality appearing on the episode, responded: “Baby Barack. It would have been amazing.”

“No, I would've felt for him,” Mrs Obama countered.

Earlier in the same episode, she appeared to take a veiled swipe at her husband, who has enjoyed practising his golf game post-presidency.

“Parenting is like fly-fishing. Never been fly fishing but from what I've seen about it it's all in the wrist it's a very delicate balance... it's like nothing works the same way every time,” she said.

“It's elegance, right? It's not dunk and drop and grab... We should go fly fishing. Better than golfing,” she added, laughing.

The Daily Mail reported on Thursday that Mrs Obama had flown to holiday in Mallorca with her daughters without her husband.

Photos show the 61-year-old enjoying a drink at The Lobster Club in Puerto Portals, accompanied by James Costos, the former US ambassador to Spain, and his partner Michael Smith, an interior designer who has worked for the Obamas.

However, in a previous podcast episode this month she praised Mr Obama as a “tremendous father” in an interview with singer Bruce Springsteen, whom Donald Trump recently labelled a “dried-up prune”.Mrs Obama, who recently has opted not accompany her husband to a number of high-profile events, including the funeral of former president Jimmy Carter in January, has claimed reports of strains in her marriage are sexist.

“If I were having problems with my husband, everybody would know about it,” she told a podcast in May.

The month before, she told podcast host Sophia Bush: “We as women, I think we struggle with, like disappointing people.

“So much so that this year people were, they couldn't even fathom that I was making a choice for myself, that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing... that's what society does to us.”

At total of 30 people were killed and 172 others injured after a mass Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17.

Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported on June 18 that search and rescue operations in the Solomianskyi district lasted more than 39 hours, involving over 400 State Emergency Service rescuers and 200 pieces of equipment.

Initial data from Ukraine's National Police cited 15 dead and 124 injured, but the death toll was revised several times — first down to 10, then up to 16 by the State Emergency Service.

Early on June 18, more victims were found under the rubble of one residential building, raising the number of fatalities to 23. After completing the operation, Klymenko confirmed 28 deaths from the attack.

President Volodymyr Zelensky updated the death toll once more in his evening address on June 19, announcing a total of 30 dead and 172 injured. 

The almost nine-hour-long strike saw Moscow's forces launch large numbers of kamikaze attack drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles at Ukraine's capital.

Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground reported the sounds of drones, missiles, and multiple rounds of explosions throughout the night.

The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that Russia launched 472 aerial weapons overnight, including nearly 280 Shahed-type attack drones and two Kinzhal ballistic missiles. The strike primarily targeted Kyiv.

Ukraine's air defense forces reportedly destroyed 428 air targets, including 239 Shahed drones and 15 Kh-101 cruise missiles. Air defenses also intercepted one Kinzhal missile, while another was reportedly lost from radar tracking.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault "one of the most horrifying attacks on Kyiv," saying more than 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched across Ukraine overnight. 

"Such attacks are pure terrorism," he said in a statement on social media. "And the whole world, the U.S., and Europe must finally respond as civilized societies respond to terrorists."

Zelensky confirmed that damage had been reported in eight districts of Kyiv, with emergency workers still searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment block.

In a video posted on Telegram, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said cluster munitions had been found in one area of the city. He later added that June 18 would be an official day of mourning in Kyiv.

Many of the deaths and injuries occurred when a Russian missile hit a nine-storey residential building in the Solomianskyi district, "completely destroying" one section, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said.

"I saw the missile because it was low," Olena Kushnirova, a 46-year-old  nurse who lives in a neighboring building to the one that was hit, told the Kyiv Independent.

"I grabbed my daughter by the hand and shouted 'run!' It was literally 15 seconds. We ran to the toilet, and then there was a very powerful explosion."

During the attack on the capital, a 62-year-old U.S. citizen died in the Solomianskyi district in a building across from where medics were assisting the injured, Klitschko reported. Medical personnel confirmed biological death.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned the attack, calling it a "massive and brutal strike" timed deliberately to coincide with the G7 summit.

"Putin does this on purpose... He sends a signal of total disrespect to the United States and other partners who have called for an end to the killing," Sybiha said. "Only strong steps and real pressure on Moscow can prove him wrong."

A Russian drone also hit a multi-storey building Darnytskyi District.

"At first there was shock," Tatiana Bratus, a 50-year-old resident of the building told the Kyiv Independent.

"People started running outside, shouting, some in panic, because the attack wasn't over yet. They said there were still rockets flying. People ran to the bomb shelter.

A kindergarten in the Darnytskyi district was also damaged, Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration said. No casualties were reported at the site. 

The upper floors of residential buildings in the Solomianskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts were also damaged.  

A dormitory at the Kyiv Aviation Institute was hit by drones during the attack, the news outlet Suspilne reported. Drones struck the institute's 10th floor and broke windows on three other floors.

Outside the capital, the attacks also caused damage and injured civilians in Kyiv Oblast towns. At least one woman was injured and multiple homes were damaged, according to the regional administration. 

The Russian strike damaged the production facility of Fahrenheit, a Ukrainian clothing manufacturer that supplies apparel and undergarments for both civilians and the military. The company announced it was forced to cancel all current orders and suspend new ones indefinitely following the destruction of its Kyiv site.

Russian forces also hit a Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) freight train carrying grain. Several railcars overturned, temporarily halting operations and spilling grain from the damaged wagons. Ukrzaliznytsia said the damage would be "promptly repaired" and train traffic would not be affected.

Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national postal service, reported the destruction of two of its branches in Kyiv during the attack, according to CEO Ihor Smiliansky. The company's team is working to "quickly restore services," he said. 

The attack followed a series of drone strikes overnight on June 16 targeting Kyiv Oblast, including both the capital and surrounding settlements. In the Obukhiv district, a 60-year-old man was injured, according to regional authorities.  

Russian attacks against Ukraine have intensified in May and June, with Moscow launching several record-breaking mass strikes against Kyiv and other cities.

In a 6-3 decision on Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee's ban on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender youth, paving the way for other bans on trans healthcare to remain in effect in 24 other states. According to the ACLU, over 100,000 transgender people under the age of 18 now live in a state with a ban on their healthcare. “This is a fight that extends back 100 years, and we will keep fighting for 100 more years,” says Chase Strangio, the first openly trangender attorney to make oral arguments before the Supreme Court and the co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBTQ & HIV Project.

The Supreme Court on June 20 ruled against a retired Florida firefighter with Parkinson's disease who wants to sue her former employer for discrimination over post-employment benefits.

The new ruling means the petitioner, Karyn Stanley, will not be able to proceed with her stalled lawsuit against Sanford, Florida.

The beginning of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts' occupation in 2014, the battle for Mariupol in 2022, and the capture of Avdiivka in 2024 are no longer just episodes of Russian aggression against Ukraine. They are now missions in the new Russian video game Squad 22: ZOV.

Nearly a year after the Russian studio SPN announced in July 2024 that it had started working on the game in cooperation with Russia's Defense Ministry, Squad 22: ZOV became available for free in Russian, English, and Chinese on Steam, an international distribution platform with over 30 million active users daily.

Before the game begins, players choose from characters from Ukraine's partially Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast, where Moscow launched its 2014 invasion under the false pretext of protecting Russian speakers from persecution, a baseless claim widely debunked as Kremlin propaganda. 

In the game, the characters say they are seeking to "bring peace" to their homeland — but under the Russian flag. Their mission is to capture positions held by the Ukrainian Armed Forces and advance deeper into Ukrainian territory, repeating Kremlin narratives that portray Russia's war as a response to “Kyiv's terror,” another certifiably false claim.

The new game is not the first time Russia has used video games as a vehicle for propaganda aimed at young audiences. But it is the first to focus on Russia's war in Ukraine, featuring real battles and characters based on actual individuals.

Almost immediately after it was published on Steam, the game was unavailable in Ukraine. As of June, it has received mixed reviews. But experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent said that even if the game fails to attract a wide audience, it still poses a threat — and there is nothing to stop Russia from continuing to develop another, potentially more effective tool for spreading its propaganda.

"Saying that Squad 22: ZOV promotes the genocide of Ukrainians, justifies the terrorism of the Russian army, and presents itself as 'a savior from the Nazis' is an understatement," Mykhailo Hrabar, a Ukrainian gaming blogger with a nickname OLDboi, told the Kyiv Independent.

Squad 22: ZOV was produced by Russian national Alexander Tolkach, who held various positions, including in Ukraine, before working on the video game.

Tolkach was a diplomat in Europe, led external communications at DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, and worked for Hungarian video game developer Gaijin Entertainment, particularly on the War Thunder video game popular among soldiers as a military simulator.

In an interview with pro-Russian military blogger Kirill Fedorov, Tolkach said Russia's Defense Ministry contacted him at the beginning of 2024 to develop a game as soon as possible "to demonstrate that we can." Tolkach also said that Russian companies are usually reluctant to make games about the Russian war in Ukraine because of their dependence on international partners and the threat of sanctions.


"The Russians are trying to figure out how far they can go with their future, more expensive, technically superior games, with which they can attract the attention of Western players and pour anything into their ears."
    

"We had to launch our own studio. The work continued, and we released the game in nine months (on the local market). It is not the perfect one, but we are not ashamed. And most importantly, we showed people: 'Look, nothing happened to us,'" Tolkach said on May 20 on Fedorov Live, referring to sanctions or bans from the international gaming community.

The game frequently refers to pro-Russian narratives that glorify the Russian army and justify Russian aggression, calling for the "liberation" of Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories fron Ukraine. The developers also said on the game's website that they consulted with those who participated in Russia's war in Ukraine, including Vladislav Golovin, a career Russian military officer who took part in the siege of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast in 2022.

According to the game's description on Steam, Squad 22: ZOV is recommended by the Russian army as a basic infantry tactical manual for cadets and members of Yunarmiya ("Youth Army"), the state-sponsored youth organization that combines ideological indoctrination with military training for children and teenagers.

Oleh Kulikov, an esports analyst, told the Kyiv Independent that the fact that a game is recommended at the state level may interest an average user even more than its content. According to the expert, Squad 22: ZOV is of low quality and will be difficult to affect a wide range of users worldwide.

"For the most part, propaganda video games are low-grade and unattractive, and this is where the Barbra Streisand effect comes in," Kulikov said, referring to a phenomenon where an attempt to hide something only brings more attention to it.

Oleksandr Petryk, a Ukrainian esports commentator with the nickname Petr1k, echoed Kulikov's stance, saying that Squad 22: ZOV has graphics of games released in the early 2000s, and is unlikely to attract young people in the way that the Ukrainian video game S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has. However, even if someone accidentally downloads the game abroad and sees the interpretation of events in Ukraine from a Russian perspective, it will play into Russia's hands, he added.

Squad 22: ZOV, made in a matter of months and openly funded by the Russian government, is unlikely to cause large-scale damage to Ukraine, but a better Russian product can, the experts interviewed by the Kyiv Independent said.

"The Russians are trying to figure out how far they can go with their future, more expensive, technically superior games, with which they can attract the attention of Western players and pour anything into their ears," game blogger Hrabar said, adding that Russia is already developing better projects, particularly about Russia's Wagner Group of mercenaries.

According to the experts, Steam, owned by the American Valve Corporation, has already been involved in scandals when controversial games were published on its platform that illegally collected user data or had a plot that contained sexual violence and were removed only after public outcry. The fact that Steam approved Squad 22: ZOV was no surprise.

"Steam has very weak moderation, which is partially performed not even by Valve employees, but by active community members," Hrabar said. "After the platform canceled the Greenlight system, which allowed the community to vote for games to be published, the pipe burst. Now you can get to the platform even with a piece of crap."

Esports analyst Kulikov added that to effectively counter Russian propaganda in video games, Ukraine must develop its own, thereby promoting the Ukrainian brand on the international market. At the same time, the Ukrainian government should respond to the launch of such propaganda projects as Squad 22: ZOV.

"Ukraine's Digital Transformation Ministry needs to reach out to companies like Valve Corporation, the very next day after the game is released or announced," Kulikov said.

"Even if it doesn't work, it will help to develop connections to establish operations and prevent something more serious from happening in the future. And it is bound to happen."

Hi, this is Kateryna, the author of the article. Thank you for reading. The war between Ukraine and Russia has long gone beyond the battlefield, and Russian propaganda is widely spread in the media, movies, and video games. The game Squad 22: ZOV is one of many examples of Russian propaganda tools, targeting one of the most vulnerable audiences, youth.

Court votes to back challenge to state waiver that allows it to set tougher car emission standards than federal limits

Fossil fuel companies are able to challenge California's ability to set stricter standards reducing the amount of polluting coming from cars, the US supreme court has ruled in a case that is set to unravel one of the key tools used to curb planet-heating emissions in recent years.

The conservative-dominated supreme court voted by seven to two to back a challenge by oil and gas companies, along with 17 Republican-led states, to a waiver that California has received periodically from the federal government since 1967 that allows it to set tougher standards than national rules limiting pollution from cars. The state has separately stipulated that only zero-emission cars will be able to sold there by 2035.

Although states are typically not allowed to set their own standards aside from the federal Clean Air Act, California has been given unique authority to do so via a waiver that has seen it become a pioneer in pushing for cleaner cars. Other states are allowed to copy California's stricter standard, too.

But oil and gas companies, as well as Republican politicians, have complained about the waiver, arguing that it caused financial harm. The waiver was removed during Donald Trump's first term but then reinstated by Joe Biden's administration.

Last week, Trump again moved to end the waiver, signing a congressional disapproval of California's move to cut pollution and shift new cars and trucks to become electric over the next decade. Gavin Newsom, California's governor and a Democrat, who is in a huge head-to-head battle with the White House over the Los Angeles protests and state power, amid Trump's immigration crackdown, has called this move illegal and has said the state will sue.

The justices' ruling overturned a lower court's decision to dismiss the lawsuit by a Valero Energy subsidiary and fuel industry groups.

The lower court had concluded that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to challenge a 2022 EPA decision to let California set its own regulations.

“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.

Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the decision.

The lower court had previously ruled that the oil and gas industry didn't have legal standing to attempt to topple the California waiver but a challenge to this reached the supreme court, which appeared sympathetic to the claim when the case was heard in April. “It's not that high a burden,” Amy Coney Barrett, one of the justices, said about proof of the alleged harm.

California and the federal government have been allowed to “stretch and abuse” the Clean Air Act, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, one of the groups challenging the waiver, has complained.

But environmentalists and California's Democratic leadership have defended the waiver, arguing that it has helped push forward vehicle innovation and help cut greenhouse gases. Transportation is responsible for more planet-heating pollution in the US than any other sector.

“California and other clean car states cannot achieve federal clean air standards and protect communities without reducing harmful transportation pollution,” said Andrea Issod, senior attorney at the Sierra Club. “We stand with these states to defend their well-established authority to set standards for clean cars.”

The supreme court's ruling on Friday does not in itself end California's standards to cut pollution from vehicles, said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund.

“The standards have saved hundreds of lives, have provided enormous health benefits, and have saved families money,” Patton said.

“While the supreme court has now clarified who has grounds to bring a challenge to court, the decision does not affect California's bedrock legal authority to adopt pollution safeguards, nor does it alter the life-saving, affordable, clean cars program itself.”

On June 6, resistance ignited in the streets of Los Angeles to confront the Trump regime's brutal campaign against immigrants, enforced by the brutality of ICE agents and the machinery of mass deportation. In a chilling escalation, Trump branded the protesters “insurrectionists” and threatened the use of military force — turning dissent into a crime and protest into a pretext for repression. Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, called Los Angeles “occupied territory,” adding, “We've been saying for years this is a fight to save civilization.”

This is not merely the rhetoric of strongman fantasies; it is the language of fascist ambition, a calculated pretext to invoke the Insurrection Act and erect a police state. Beneath this chilling facade lies something far more ominous: the weaponization of the war on immigrants as a means to orchestrate ethnic cleansing, veiled under the apparatus of law and the grotesque spectacle of state power. Moreover, as Kristi Noem and Trump have blatantly outlined, their assault on immigrants extends beyond individual lives — it's a direct attack on the U.S.'s largest cities, like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, which stand as Democratic Party strongholds. When they claim to be liberating these urban centers from “socialists,” they are not just declaring war on ideological foes, they are also setting the stage for a fascist takeover, one rooted in division and destruction. This is not about upholding law and order; it is the calculated weaponization of authoritarian culture to escalate state violence, instill terror, criminalize dissent, and legitimize white nationalist ideology. By framing defiance as treason, Trump attempts to cloak his own authoritarian crimes while constructing a political climate where any challenge to power is met with brutal retaliation. As Michelle Goldberg noted in The New York Times, “This is what autocracy looks like.”

The authoritarian dream is rooted in the belief that state violence should serve as the primary tool of governance. When the guardrails of democracy are dismantled, violence shifts from being a last resort to a governing principle. This is precisely what unfolded in Los Angeles, where Trump deployed the National Guard and Marines to crush protests against his mass deportation policies, while mobilizing ICE as a modern-day Gestapo. What cannot be ignored is that the militarization of civil society is not merely an overreaction or illegal response to a fabricated insurrection; it is the very foundation upon which martial law is established, paving the way for a fully realized fascist state. What unfolded in LA was not an insurrection; it was the people rising in defense of democracy. The true insurrection happened on January 6, with Trump as its chief architect. Yet once again, violence was being used not to protect democracy, but to crush it.

What we are witnessing is a spectacle of domination. The deployment of troops, the vigilante targeting of Democratic lawmakers, the planned grotesquerie of Trump's military parade, and Trump's order for ICE to target cities led by Democrats are not isolated events — they are scenes in the same authoritarian drama. Together, they represent a fusion of militarism and national identity, designed to normalize cruelty, fetishize strength, and recast obedience as patriotism. As Susan Sontag once warned, fascism cloaks violence in the aesthetics of spectacle — making submission not only palatable, but seductive. This is the pornography of power — where culture and repression merge in a theater of fear, scripted to extinguish political imagination and render dissent illegible.

If we are to reclaim democracy not as a slogan but as a living, breathing ethos, we must begin with culture.

In this moment of escalating violence, Trump's use of force is more than a show of control — it is a pedagogical performance meant to normalize repression and etch it into public consciousness. This is fascist aesthetics reimagined for a media-saturated age, where power must not only be wielded but displayed as performance. Here, domination is choreographed, televised, and turned into a civic lesson. The spectacle becomes a tutorial in submission, transforming images of state violence into instruments of mass indoctrination. Culture is not summoned to illuminate reality but to obliterate it, replacing historical memory with myth, dissent with loyalty, and resistance with silence. The convergence of Trump's militarized crackdown in Los Angeles and his self-aggrandizing parade of force reveals a machinery of destruction no longer hidden but flaunted, a grotesque exhibition engineered to numb the senses and turn state terror into a national ritual.

In the current political moment, we would do well to remember Milan Kundera's words from The Book of Laughter and Forgetting:

The first step in liquidating a people is to erase its memory. Destroy its books, its culture, its history. Then have someone write new books, manufacture a new culture, invent a new history. Before long the nation will begin to forget what it is and what it was.

Indeed dominant culture is not peripheral to politics; it is its staging ground, its arsenal, and, increasingly, its most contested terrain. Authoritarianism does not rely solely on law or policy; it reshapes consciousness, manufactures consent, and weaves the logic of domination into the fabric of everyday life. Under Trump, culture is not merely an accessory to power – it is the weapon and the war zone.

Democracy is not shattered only by the blunt force of military coups; instead, it can be hollowed out from within, undermined by the ghosts of past tyrannies reanimated through symbols, digital technologies, and the ever-churning machinery of social media. Today, power speaks in the seductive language of images laced with bigotry, seeded with cruelty, and driven by the logic of exclusion and ethnic cleansing. Culture is no longer merely a reflection of the past; it has become its erasure. It functions as pedagogy — through what Ariella Aïsha Azoulay names as “imperial technologies,” and what I have called “disimagination machines.” It is designed to strip the colonized not only of their futures but of their histories, their very presence in the world. In this age of resurgent fascisms, we see its devastating effects in the genocidal assault waged by Israel against the Palestinian people, and in the scorched-earth war on historical memory and civic belonging carried out by the Trump regime in the United States. Culture is no longer a backdrop to political struggle — it is its very stage, its arsenal, and its battleground. Culture as an educational force is no longer subordinate to relations of power — it is the very essence of politics.

This is the pornography of power — where culture and repression merge in a theater of fear, scripted to extinguish political imagination and render dissent illegible.

As Catherine Caruso points out in Harvard News, “AI-powered autonomous weapons represent a new era in warfare and pose a concrete threat to scientific progress and basic research.” Yet the danger extends far beyond the battlefield. Artificial intelligence now plays an insidious role in shaping policy, normalizing militarism, censoring ethical debate, and legitimizing what can only be described as a culture of war. It reconfigures not only how we fight but also how we think — molding public consciousness in ways that privilege surveillance over solidarity, control over compassion.

For instance, the rise of artificial intelligence is accelerating a cultural transformation that is as dangerous as it is seductive. When OpenAI recently shut down its ChatGPT responses on the Gaza war for “safety” reasons, it wasn't a glitch, — it was a warning. AI is not just organizing knowledge; it is curating memory, defining what can be said, and erasing what must be forgotten. In the wrong hands — and increasingly in the hands of authoritarian regimes and corporate overlords — AI becomes a weapon not of innovation but of ideological control. Brett Wilkins reports in Common Dreams that “commercial AI models are directly being used” by Israel in Gaza for mass surveillance and the targeting of “critics, dissidents, and opponents.” Culture, in this context, is no longer merely shaped by human struggle and historical memory; it is engineered, automated, and sanitized.

Too many on the left have long overlooked a fundamental truth: The real battle against gangster capitalism and its updated fascist versions is not solely over policies or economies but over culture itself — over the values, desires, and everyday practices that shape how people see the world and their place within it.

Historically, some strands of Marxist and progressive thought have dismissed culture as secondary or irrelevant — a critique that scholar Judith Butler powerfully challenged in their 1997 essay. They argued that the left's cultural focus was wrongly seen as abandoning the materialist core of Marxist politics, often accused of being “factionalizing, identitarian, and [narrowly] particularistic.”

Downplaying the role of culture is not just a tactical misstep — it's a fundamental error. As Antonio Gramsci warned, all politics is pedagogical, and every exercise of “hegemony” is inherently an educational act. In a capitalist society, the power of education does more than repress critical thought and informed consciousness, it actively shapes and empowers. It creates subjects, molds emotions, and defines what we accept as sensible.

AI is not just organizing knowledge; it is curating memory, defining what can be said, and erasing what must be forgotten.

As Theodor Adorno argued, capitalism is not merely an economic system but a totalizing cultural force, shaping desire through the “culture industry” — reducing human experience to commodified clichés and reinforcing conformity through repetition and distraction. Raymond Williams insisted that culture is both ordinary and political, embedded in the everyday practices through which people live and make meaning. Like Vaclav Havel, he believed that, “the political is not independent of the cultural, but it follows it.”

In this view, politics follows culture because the culture is the terrain in which politics establishes itself, the framework through which individuals are shaped, and the force that reproduces societies in ways that sustain distinct political systems. Stuart Hall's work is crucial here in illuminating how culture is the site where ideology takes root, where identities are formed, contested, and secured. As Bruce Robbins notes in a commentary on Hall, the cultural theorist argued that everyday life could not be separated from politics as a matter of lived experience, and that culture could not be removed from “the political and economic structures that constrained it.”

This was particularly true for Hall's critique of neoliberalism, which he viewed not only as an economic system but also as a pedagogical project. According to Hall, capitalism is not just enforced from above; it is lived, felt, and reproduced from below, woven into the most intimate structures of daily life, particularly given its notion that the market is the template for all social relations and embracing Margaret Thatcher's toxic claim that there is no such thing as society.

We are, in this Trumpian historical moment, suffocating under a dominant culture that functions as a powerful disimagination machine, shaping desires, identities, and common sense through a vast network of pedagogical sites, from social media and news platforms to advertising, entertainment, and relentless political spectacles. Education is no longer merely an institutional force; it has become the most decisive cultural arena where individual and collective consciousness is produced and contested. Hall understood this with prophetic clarity. For him, culture is never outside politics, it is the terrain on which political struggle is fought, particularly through the politics of identification.

Later in his life, Hall warned that the left had failed to grasp the educative dimension of politics, the need to transform not just policies but the very framework through which people interpret the world and their place in it. In a 2012 interview with The Guardian's Zoe Williams, Hall put it bluntly: “The left is in trouble. It's not got any ideas, it's not got any independent analysis of its own, and therefore it's got no vision. It just takes the temperature: ‘Whoa, that's no good, let's move to the right.' It has no sense of politics being educative, of politics changing the way people see things.”

For Hall, without this pedagogical imperative, the left forfeits its ability to generate hope, build alliances, and forge new political subjectivities: The promise of democracy is torn asunder. In the shadow of rising state terrorism, bodies are broken, abducted, and freedoms extinguished. Silence spreads like a fog. It blankets the cries of the young, the starving children of Gaza; lives obliterated by bombs and buried by indifference as entire families are killed by Israel in Gaza. The horror knows no borders, reproduced at home as immigrant youth in the United States are torn from their families, thrust into a trauma so vast it swallows the future.

Trump's budget, which he calls “one big, beautiful bill,” is a deliberate weapon of mass inequality, ruthlessly crafted to fatten the coffers of the financial elite while punishing the most vulnerable.

Meanwhile, as Peter Baker notes in The New York Times, the demagogue-in-chief revels in gifts from dictators, ranging from a luxury flying palace from Qatar to collecting “$320 million in fees from a new cryptocurrency” and shamelessly brokering “overseas real estate deals worth billions of dollars.” Trump displays his vast corruption while openly normalizing the widespread abuse of presidential power. How else to explain his “opening an exclusive club in Washington called the Executive Branch [while] charging $500,000 apiece to join,” all the while presiding over a regime that slashes “funding for health care, food and education through some of the largest cuts in U.S. history, while even raising taxes on many low-income families”?

This is a Trump-Musk-engineered culture of cruelty, ramped up to grotesque extremes, a form of state terrorism that Bill Gates aptly describes as “killing the world's poorest children,” both here and abroad. Beneath the surface, the agenda is clear: Trump's budget, which he calls “one big, beautiful bill,” is a deliberate weapon of mass inequality, ruthlessly crafted to fatten the coffers of the financial elite while punishing the most vulnerable. In addition, it has the “potential to increase the federal deficit by up to $3.8 trillion over the next decade.” This monstrous budget, born from the twisted minds of Trump and his MAGA sycophants, is so brutal that Paul Krugman condemns it as a product of “sadistic zombies,” a horrifying manifestation of cruelty that reflects the regime's moral decay. His anger is rightly focused on a budget that slashes taxes for the ultra-wealthy while funneling endless resources into instruments of state violence, all in the name of control, domination, and the obliteration of any semblance of social justice, both within our borders and beyond.

This is more than a policy crisis. It is a cultural catastrophe. Fascism today is not only wrapped in lawless decrees and armed repression, it is also cloaked in spectacles of cruelty and a language steeped in hate and terminal exclusion. Trump's fervent advocates, Elon Musk and Steve Bannon, raise Nazi salutes, as though rehearsing for the dark future they are determined to summon. Stephen Miller channels Hitler's rhetoric under the guise of patriotism, declaring that “America is for Americans and Americans only.” Trump resurrects the Confederacy, embracing its monuments, symbols, and genocidal logic. In their hands, the culture of fascism is not hidden. It is performed, televised, and normalized. The horror of fascist violence is back, though it is now draped in AI-guided bombs, ethnic cleansing, and white supremacists basking in their project of racial cleansing while destroying every vestige of decency, human rights, and democracy.

What we are witnessing is the death not just of democracy but of moral and civic conscience itself. A collective numbness has settled in, a culture of forgetting, cruelty and complicity, where silence speaks louder than resistance, enabling the violence to grow unchecked. In part, this is fueled by an anti-intellectualism and culture that embraces civic illiteracy, a culture of immediacy that banishes informed judgment and contemplation, and institutions that embrace critical thought as a foundation for creating critical citizens. We are not merely talking about the death of the imagination, but an attack on any institutions that provide what Hannah Arendt once called “thinking without a banister.”

This is more than a policy crisis. It is a cultural catastrophe.

At the heart of this decay lies a cultural ethos cultivated by capitalism for decades: to live is to consume, selfishness is freedom, personal responsibility eclipses systemic problems, and solidarity is weakness. Culture has become a site of struggle, now more intense than ever, amplified by new digital technologies, social media, podcasts, and a host of other pedagogical platforms. These platforms not only disempower resistance but also amplify the forces of domination, shaping the contours of public discourse and ideological control. Society fragments further, social atomization rises, and the numbing routines of a consumer-driven spectacle are matched by what Jonathan Crary calls “vacant forms of attentiveness.”

Corporate-controlled cultural apparatuses now hold immense pedagogical and political power, reshaping the relationship between power, culture, and daily life. Everyday existence is captive to new modes of socialization, a tsunami of fragmentation, and the dissolution of society, driven by the morally numbing routines of a punishing state and its ever-expanding criminalization of free speech and social problems. In such a climate, the ideological mobilization of memory, agency, and desire becomes inseparable from the pedagogical construction of neoliberal public spaces and civic life, laying the foundation for an emerging authoritarianism.

Also central to this emerging fascism is a culture in which memory is rendered inaccessible, critical thinking is scorned, and dissent is branded as treason, subject to harsh penalties imposed by a regime of terror — one that includes abductions, attacks on due process, an unprecedented assault on higher education, and a growing political culture of corruption and lawlessness.

This isn't to suggest that culture is simply absorbed into an all-encompassing system of domination, subjugated by the unchecked power of brutal billionaires and Vichy-like politicians. On the contrary, culture has moved to the front lines of struggle, central to the effort to normalize gangster capitalism, erase institutions that promote democratic values, and create an army of loyal fascist subjects. The vicious attacks by the Trump administration on higher education, public schools, journalists, oppositional media, and dissident politicians demonstrate the fear of Trump and his enablers who recognize the power of these institutions in potentially educating students and the wider public to hold power accountable, to engage in refusal rather than in conformity, adaptation, and political resignation.

At the same time, the right's attacks have eroded the responsibility of institutions like Columbia University to stand against Trump's assault on academic freedom and free speech. In failing to resist, they become complicit in what Chris Hedges describes as “capitulations and crackdowns on pro-Palestine activism,” resulting in the suspension, expulsion, and firing of students and professors protesting the genocide in Gaza.

In this context, as I recently stated in an interview on Courage My Friends podcast, that critical education is the glue that connects hope, justice, and the fight for a real, radical democracy. If we fail to recognize the centrality of education, the left will be in serious trouble. But equally crucial is the need to rethink the power of culture as a site of both domination and empowerment, a site that holds profound pedagogical, economic, and political significance in the digital age.

Cultural politics has a long legacy in Marxist thought, from Gramsci and Hall, to Robin D.G. Kelley, the Frankfurt School and the Situationists, to the radical movements of the 1960s and the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement. It's time to reignite and propel this work forward, to shape it anew in the crucible of our present crisis and the urgency of this historical moment.

What we are witnessing is the death not just of democracy but of moral and civic conscience itself.

Late former Uruguayan President José Mujica, in one of his speeches, reprinted in Jacobin, argued poignantly that capitalism is not just property relations but a set of cultural values that the Left must confront with a culture of solidarity. He argued strongly that social change could not be reduced to changing capitalist economies and that “capitalism is a culture” with enormous power that must be understood, analyzed and resisted. The late cultural critic Ellen Willis adds to this insight by noting that at the core of cultural politics is the recognition “that the project of organizing a democratic political movement necessarily entails the hope that one's ideas and beliefs are not merely idiosyncratic but speak to vital human needs, interests, and desires, and therefore will be persuasive to many and ultimately most people.”

Mujica's reflection on the limits of revolutionary strategy underscores the crucial role of culture in any transformative movement, emphasizing that without a profound shift in cultural consciousness, systemic change remains unattainable. This insight directly ties into the larger thesis that fascism cannot be countered merely through political and economic reforms but requires a radical transformation of culture itself, a cultural shift that challenges the very values and ideologies that sustain authoritarianism. He makes clear that struggles over culture are not just about struggles over meaning and identity, but struggles over power, human freedom and equality.

Mujica's lament is our warning. My generation, he said, made the mistake of believing that revolution meant taking over the means of production. Some of us thought we could change the system without changing the culture. But capitalism, he insisted, survives not through force alone, but through the everyday values it instills, values stronger than any army. You cannot build a new world with people shaped by the old one: “You cannot build a socialist building with bricklayers who are capitalists,” he warned, because their consciousness will reproduce the very system they seek to overthrow.

This insight could not be more relevant and urgent. If we are to resist the death cult of fascism, if we are to reclaim democracy not as a slogan but as a living, breathing ethos, we must begin with culture. Not the commodified culture of products and performances, but culture in its deepest sense: the web of values, relationships, and meanings that shape how we live and what we imagine possible. We need, in short, a cultural revolution rooted in a politics of solidarity, care, limits, and humility. To be revolutionary today means more than redistributing wealth and changing economic structures, however fundamental. It also means redefining what it means to live well. It means teaching each other to resist the seductions of greed and the numbness of cruelty. It means building new ways of being together, of listening, of imagining. As Mujica said, “Poor is the one who needs a lot.” The left must reclaim a culture of enough, of sufficiency rather than excess, of cooperation rather than conquest.

Culture, as an educational force, does more than mirror society — it challenges dominant ideologies, unsettles normalized values, and disrupts the social relations that sustain oppression. It cultivates a critical awareness of how power operates, but awareness alone is not enough. Knowledge must ignite action. Critical consciousness must be bound to collective struggles — to movements that confront the machinery of poverty, the cruelty of inequality, the devastation of climate collapse, and the enduring violence of systemic racism. Without this fusion of insight and resistance, culture risks becoming reflection without consequence, critique without transformation.

The challenge for left progressives and others is to produce an anti-capitalist culture that provides the modes of literacy, comprehensive analysis, historical consciousness, and vision to make clear and resist a long legacy of colonialism with its fantasies of displacement, dispossession, and extermination. One cannot be silent or ignore a cultural politics in which Trump calls for a policy that amounts to the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from northern Gaza.

Trump's neocolonial vision of an ethnically cleansed Gaza is not policy; it's cultural imperialism draped in empire, a death wish spoken aloud, a nightmare clawing its way into daylight. The rigor mortis of ethical and political decay, born from colonial and imperial fantasies, is made even more visible by Trump's call to annex Canada, Panama, and Greenland. Intoxicated with power, this resurgent view of globalization is fashioned on a toxic mix of greed, fear, delusions of grandeur, and cruelty. This is cultural politics in the service of death, a form of politics that not only perpetuates violence but also reshapes society in its own image, normalizing annihilation and dispossession as acceptable byproducts of imperial ambition.

There is no future without a cultural shift away from gangster capitalism. Without it, the left risks fading into a mere ghost, clinging to slogans while the world burns, as the politics of extermination, displacement, and ethnic cleansing rage on. The horrors of the past are back, but so too must be our memory, our imagination, and our courage to begin again — not as mourners of a failed nostalgia, but as creators of a new, insurgent radical democratic culture. A culture that remembers the children, hears the silences, and refuses to let the future be stolen without a fight. The fight against fascism demands a new language, one that integrates materialist and cultural concerns, where the critique of structural domination is inseparable from cultural and educational struggles. This language must reshape how we think about power, justice, and agency, emphasizing the need for a critical pedagogy and cultural transformation that challenges the ideologies sustaining authoritarianism while empowering collective resistance.

In this struggle, pedagogy is not peripheral; it is the front line. Education, culture, and daily life are the terrains where fascism is either normalized or resisted. This is where mass consciousness takes root and where the seeds of a transformative political movement are sown. Despair is not an option; it is surrender. In an era when silence is complicity and culture is weaponized to erase memory and stifle dissent, what's needed is a revolutionary pedagogy, a cultural politics that teaches us to remember, to resist, and to reimagine the world. As the late political philosopher Sheldon Wolin warned, “the central challenge of our time … is about nurturing a discordant democracy,” a task that depends on awakening “the civic consciousness of the nation.” This means placing culture at the very heart of politics — where critique, agency, and the radical imagination converge.

TEL AVIV, June 20. /TASS/. Israel detected missile launches from Iran and issued an air-raid alert in many parts of the country.

According to a TASS reporter, sirens went off in areas including near Tel Aviv, and at least one loud explosion was heard during the attack.

According to the Ynet news website, the alert was issued at the same time in many parts of the Israel: from the north to the very south, including the Eilat area on the Red Sea coast.

According to Israel's Channel 12 television, this time around Iran launched about 25 missiles, according to preliminary data.

The National Ambulance Service said at least two people suffered injuries, with one of them in serious condition and the other in moderate condition.

The military has not yet commented on the aftermath of the attack, but canceled the air-raid alert and allowed people to leave shelters.

MARK RUTTE is Secretary-General of NATO. He served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 2010 to 2024.

 Mark Rutte 

The main entrance of NATO headquarters in Brussels is flanked by two somber memorials that serve as reminders of why we need the alliance. On one side is a section of the Berlin Wall, a symbol of NATO's defense of freedom and democracy in the face of the Soviet Union. On the other side is a twisted mass of metal from the World Trade Center, a reminder of the only time NATO allies triggered Article 5 of the founding treaty—an attack on one is an attack on all. These monuments underscore how and why North America and Europe have stood strong together in this alliance for more than seven decades. As NATO's members face an increasingly dangerous world, it is our task to make the alliance stronger, fair, and more lethal so that it continues to keep adversaries at bay.

Russia has brought war back to Europe and has teamed up with China, North Korea, and Iran to reshape the global order. Together, they are expanding their militaries and their capabilities. Even when the war in Ukraine eventually ends, the danger that Moscow poses will not disappear. Russia is reconstituting its forces with Chinese technology and producing weapons faster than we thought it could. This year alone, Russia is expected to roll out 1,500 tanks, 3,000 armored vehicles, and 200 Iskander missiles. Russia could be ready to challenge NATO militarily within five years. And China has become decisive in enabling Russia's war against Ukraine and supporting Russia's defense industrial base, even as it, with no transparency, modernizes and expands its own military at breakneck speed. China already has the world's largest navy; its overall battle force is expected to grow to 395 ships this year and to 435 by 2030. China also aims to have more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030. China's ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security, and values.

We cannot afford to hope for the best; we must prepare for the worst. It is clear that those who stand against freedom are readying themselves for long-term confrontation with NATO. In 1936, the British statesman Winston Churchill asked the House of Commons whether there would be enough time before the outbreak of war for the United Kingdom to put its “defenses in order” or “will the awful words ‘too late' be recorded?” That is the question for NATO now. The alliance cannot wait idly by; instead, it must undertake efforts necessary to enhance our defenses.

To make NATO stronger means investing much more in its defense, which underpins everything. All allies will spend at least two percent of GDP on defense this year. That fulfills the pledge made at the Wales summit in 2014—a crucial step. For the NATO summit in The Hague, we are preparing a concrete plan for allies to raise their investment in defense to five percent of GDP. This would mean more resources for core defense requirements, as well as investments in future capabilities. This new benchmark is not chosen at random but is rooted in the reality of NATO's defense plans and the capability targets that stem from them. Five percent spending will be necessary to have the forces and capabilities to implement our defense plans in full and protect the Euro-Atlantic. This will mark a quantum leap in our collective defense.

The new defense investment plan has two parts. The bulk of spending will be put toward core defense requirements. Ambitious new targets, agreed to by NATO defense ministers in early June, define what forces and capabilities allies need to provide. The exact details are classified, but the alliance will need to increase the number of its air and missile defense systems fivefold. The war against Ukraine has made clear how Russia can strike indiscriminately from the skies; at present, air, missile, and drone defenses are in short supply among NATO members. The alliance also needs thousands more armored vehicles and tanks and millions more artillery shells. We must double our enabling capabilities, such as logistics, supply, transportation, and medical support. Allies will also invest in more warships, aircraft, drones, and long-range missile systems. NATO will sharpen its technological edge by spending more in the cyber and space domains, bolstering innovation, and speeding up its ability to integrate new technology into the defense sector.

The other part of the plan supports defense- and security-related investments, including in infrastructure. NATO needs civilian transport networks that can move militaries—to get the right forces to the right place at the right time. Although our aim is to prevent war, should the need arise, roads, railways, and ports will be the arteries in any conflict, providing the flow of forces, munitions, and supplies. NATO is working closely with the European Union on military mobility and defense industrial cooperation. Our societies and militaries are in this together, and the alliance will invest more in civil preparedness and go further to protect against cyberattacks, sabotage, and other threats.

Any effort to invest in NATO's security should include financing and capital improvements to its defense industrial base. It is clear that the alliance is not producing enough. Substantial increases in demand for military hardware must be met with increased supply, not higher prices. Allies must be able to rapidly produce, sustain, and replenish military equipment, including basic munitions, complex weapons systems, and the rapidly evolving new technologies that are the hallmark of warfighting today. Industrial might and military might go hand in hand. Given that NATO needs not only to defend itself but also to deter its adversaries, it must show that it can outproduce and outperform its rivals. That requires an industrial renaissance, not just in defense but across NATO economies. The alliance needs more steel and electricity, just as it needs more tanks and jets.



To make this a reality, NATO is supporting increased defense production, removing barriers to cooperation, harnessing cutting-edge technologies, and fostering innovation. For example, Task Force X Baltic is a NATO initiative to accelerate the deployment of uncrewed maritime systems, integrate artificial intelligence into naval operations, and secure the alliance's undersea infrastructure. We are also learning from Ukraine, which has shown how new or adapted technologies can sometimes deliver the same or even greater effect as traditional military “heavy metal” at a fraction of the cost. For example, Ukrainian drones that cost $400 have taken out $2 million Russian tanks.

Increased defense spending and production not only strengthens NATO's ability to deter and defend but also acts as an engine for economic growth. Enhancing and expanding the defense industry on both sides of the Atlantic creates jobs. The NATO summit in The Hague will send a clear message to defense firms that demand for their services is strong, and it is vital that industry meet the alliance's ambition. Increasing defense spending will require allies to make difficult choices. They will hold vigorous debates about allocating more funding for defense and the tradeoffs that are required. But security is the foundation of prosperity, and there is no alternative to preserve our freedom and way of life.

NATO will become stronger as its members invest more, better, and together in defense. The alliance will also become fairer as each ally contributes its part. The United States has carried an outsize portion of NATO's security burden for too long. But America's allies are clear in their commitment to sharing the responsibility within NATO more equally. European allies and Canada now lead seven of the eight multinational deployments on NATO's eastern flank. The United States' allies play a crucial role in long-term support to Kyiv—by providing personnel to NATO's Security Assistance and Training command for Ukraine in Wiesbaden and a significant share of security assistance. An Italian commander leads NATO's peacekeeping mission in Kosovo; a French general leads the training and advisory mission in Iraq; and European allies lead NATO's air policing over Iceland, the western Balkans, and the Baltics. The United States' allies will do even more for collective defense in the future, backed by Washington's rock-solid commitment to NATO.

The threats against us are growing, so in addition to ensuring that NATO is stronger and fairer, we also need to become more lethal. That means strengthening our deterrence and defense posture and showing any aggressor that if an ally is attacked, NATO has the ability and resolve to hit back harder. NATO will always be a defensive alliance; the intent of its military might is to preserve peace. But to preserve the peace, we must prepare for war. That is precisely what we are doing at our next summit in The Hague.

Back at NATO headquarters, in addition to the monuments marking the Cold War and 9/11, other symbols capture what the alliance is and why it matters. There is a memorial to those who have fallen in service of freedom and security; an iconic steel sculpture of the NATO star—to remind us of the need to navigate a volatile landscape on the path to peace; and the flags of the 32 nations that come together day in and day out in support of collective defense. Peace through strength is what NATO was made for, and it is the driving force of the decisions we will take in The Hague.

ST. PETERSBURG, June 20. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with Sheikh Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the national security advisor to the king of Bahrain, on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF).

The meeting took place immediately before SPIEF's plenary session, as Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing earlier.

As Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov announced, the meeting's main topic was the Middle Eastern escalation. In Bahrain, the sheikh is directly responsible for addressing regional crisis-related issues.

The escalation in the Middle East, triggered by Israel's unjustified strikes on Iran, has hindered air links in the region. However, Bahrain, by sending its high representative, has underlined the importance of its participation in SPIEF and of talks with Russia as one of the leading global players.

The St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) is taking place on June 18-21. This year, the event is held under the theme "Shared Values: The Foundation of Growth in a Multipolar World." Thematic zones such as the ‘Territory of Innovation' and the national brand space ‘Buy Russian!' will operate at the Forum.

The program includes the SME Forum, the Creative Industries Forum, the Day of the Future International Youth Economic Forum, the Drug Security Forum, and the Roscongress Urban Hub discussion platform. As part of the cultural program, the Petersburg Seasons festival will be held, and the SPIEF Sports Games will take place.

The Roscongress Foundation is the organizer of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. TASS is its information partner.

With misinformation and murky details on bird flu and measles outbreaks, experts worry about the next pandemic

Amid controversial dismissals for independent advisers and staff at health agencies, alongside lackluster responses to the bird flu and measles outbreaks, experts fear the US is now in worse shape to respond to a pandemic than before 2020.

H5N1, which has received less attention under the Trump administration than from Biden's team, is not the only influenza virus or even the only variant of bird flu with the potential to spark a pandemic. But a subpar response to the ongoing US outbreak signals a larger issue: America is not ready for whatever pathogen will sweep through next.

“We have not even remotely maintained the level of pandemic preparedness – which needed a lot of work, as we saw from the Covid pandemic,” said Angela Rasmussen, an American virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “But now, we essentially have no pandemic preparedness.”

“I'm concerned on a number of fronts,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health.

Those concerns include a lack of quality information from officials, weakened virus monitoring systems, and public health reductions at the federal, state and local levels.

“The thing that I am most concerned about is the veracity of information coming out of the health agencies,” Nuzzo said.

In the ongoing outbreaks of measles, for example, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of health and human services, has downplayed the severity of the disease, spread misinformation about the highly effective vaccine to prevent measles, and pushed unproven treatments.

“The communications on measles gives me deep worries about what would happen in a pandemic,” Nuzzo said. “If a pandemic were to occur today, the only thing we would have to protect ourselves on day one would be information.”

The H5N1 outbreak has been plagued by incomplete information, an issue that began in the Biden administration but has amplified under Trump.

In Arizona, 6 million chickens were killed or culled at a Hickman's Family Farms location because of H5N1 in May. That's about 95% of the company's hen population in the state. Hundreds of workers, including inmate laborers, are now being dismissed as Arizona braces for egg shortages.

Yet even as H5N1 outbreaks continue to spread on farms and wreak havoc on the food supply, no new bird flu cases have been reported in people for months.

“I am concerned that we may not be finding new infections in humans,” Nuzzo said – and a lack of testing may be the culprit.

“We're not testing – it's not that there are no new cases,” Rassmussen said.

The last bird flu case in a person was listed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 23 February.

At that point, at least 830 people in the US had been tested after contact with sick animals. This kind of testing – monitoring the health of people who regularly work with H5N1-infected animals – is how the vast majority of cases (64 out of 70) have been found in this outbreak.

But then, several CDC officials overseeing the bird flu response were fired on 1 April.

Since then, only about 50 people in the US have been tested after exposure to sick animals – and no positive cases have been announced.

It's also been difficult to understand the extent of the outbreak and how the virus spreads among animals.

“We still just don't have a good picture of the scope and scale of this outbreak – we never really have. And until we have that, we're not going to be able to contain it,” Rasmussen said.

“It's extremely bad,” she continued. “We don't have any information about what's happening right now. The next pandemic could be starting, and we just don't know where that's happening, and we don't have any ability to find out.”

Huge reductions in the public health workforce and resources has led to less monitoring of outbreaks, known as disease surveillance.

“Cutting back on that surveillance is leaving us more in the dark,” Nuzzo said.

The CDC clawed back $11.4bn in Covid funding in March. This funding was used to monitor, test, vaccinate and otherwise respond to public health issues at the state, local, territorial and tribal level.

“We're seeing health departments scrambling,” Nuzzo said. “That infrastructure is just dramatically eroding.”

International monitoring programs to address outbreaks before they expand across borders have also been cancelled.

“We have taken for granted all of those protections, and I fear that we are poised to see the consequences,” Nuzzo said.

Trump's crackdown on immigration also poses a major challenge in detecting cases and treating patients during outbreaks.

“A lot of the people who are most at risk are strongly disincentivized to report any cases, given that many of them are undocumented or are not US citizens,” Rasmussen said. “Nobody wants to go get tested if they're going to end up in an Ice detention facility.”

When cases are not detected, that means patients are not able to access care.

Although it's rare for people to become sick with H5N1, for instance – the virus is still primarily an avian, not a human, influenza – this variant of bird flu has a 52% mortality rate globally among people with known infections.

Allowing a deadly virus to spread and mutate under the radar has troubling implications for its ability to change into a human influenza without anyone knowing.

And if such changes were detected, widening gaps in communication could be the next hurdle for preventing a pandemic, Nuzzo said.

“Communication is our most important public health intervention. People, in order to be able to know how to protect themselves, need to have access to facts, and they need to believe in the messengers. And the communication around the measles outbreaks are deeply eroding our standing with the American people.”

Even stockpiled vaccines and other protective measures, like personal protective equipment, take time to distribute, Nuzzo added. “And flu is a fast-moving disease that could cause a lot of damage in the months it would take to mount a vaccination campaign.”

The US government's cancellation of its $766m contract with Moderna to research and develop an H5N1 vaccine also signals a concerning strategy from health officials, Nuzzo and Rasmussen said.

Other restrictions on vaccine development, like a new plan to test all vaccines against saline placebos, is “going to make it extremely difficult to approve any new vaccine” and would “have a devastating impact on our ability to respond to a potential pandemic”, Rasmussen said – especially in a rapidly moving pandemic where speed matters.

“You don't have time for that if this virus causes a human-to–human outbreak,” Rasmussen said.

All of these policies mean the US is less prepared for a pandemic than it was in 2020, she said. And it also means there will be preventable suffering now, even before the next big one strikes.

“We are actively making people less safe, less healthy and more dead,” Rasmussen said.

Russian authorities are considering a request from the New People's Party to offer political asylum to U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk, claimed the party's lawmaker, Vladislav Davankov, to the Russian media on June 20.

Davankov, deputy speaker of the State Duma, told reporters at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum that his party had formally petitioned the Russian Foreign Ministry to provide Musk with asylum. The request is expected to be reviewed within a month, he reportedly said.

"I think Elon Musk has made mistakes, but those mistakes should be forgiven," Davankov said. "If things don't work out for him, we are always ready to welcome him — from a technological and visionary point of view, he's very impressive."

The claim could not be independently verified, and there has been no official confirmation from the Russian Foreign Ministry or Musk. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment, telling reporters, "Let's wait for a statement from the Foreign Ministry or from Musk himself before we say anything."

The alleged request follows a public conflict that erupted between Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month. The billionaire later expressed regret over a series of critical posts aimed at Trump, calling a proposed government spending bill "disgusting" and warning of economic consequences. 

Trump hit back during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on June 5, saying on Truth Social that Musk had "just gone crazy."

In response, Musk claimed on social media that Trump owed him his electoral victory, suggesting his influence prevented Democrats from retaining the House.

Earlier this month, Dmitry Novikov, deputy chair of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, told state-run news agency TASS that Russia would be ready to provide Musk with political asylum if needed. 

"I think Musk is playing a completely different game, that he won't need political asylum, although if he did, Russia could certainly provide it," Novikov said on June 6.

The feud has attracted attention in Russia, where Musk is increasingly viewed as a sympathetic figure. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, joked on X that Moscow could broker peace between "D and E," referring to Donald and Elon, in exchange for Starlink shares. "Don't fight, guys," Medvedev wrote.

Musk led a federal commission on government efficiency until May 30 and has been a key figure in dismantling U.S. foreign aid institutions, including USAID, which has delivered billions in aid to Ukraine.

Though he initially supported Ukraine by providing Starlink satellite systems to aid its defense, Musk eventually adopted Russian talking points, claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky lacks popular support and accusing Kyiv of running a "never-ending draft meat grinder."

He has also spoken out against U.S. military aid to Ukraine, a stance that aligns closely with Kremlin messaging aimed at discouraging Western support for Kyiv.

Red potash in a warehouse at Nutrien's Cory potash mine near Saskatoon. The company's products extend across potash, nitrogen and phosphate produced in Canada and U.S.The Globe and Mail

When bad things happen in the world, you need a little fertilizer in your portfolio. That's the takeaway from the latest rally by Nutrien Ltd. NTR-T, whose share price is on its second geopolitical-inspired rip within the past three years.

But will the current rally take the stock toward new heights?

Saskatoon-based Nutrien, the world's largest fertilizer producer, emerged as one of the hottest Canadian stocks after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. 

Trade restrictions and transportation bottlenecks turned a tight market for crop nutrients into a frantic one. That fattened the profit margins at Nutrien and drove its share price up – if only briefly – about 60 per cent in just over two months, to a high above $147. 

Though now well off those peaks in 2022, the stock is moving again: It has rallied about 31 per cent so far in 2025, as of Thursday. 

Much of this gain followed corporate cost savings, higher potash prices and upbeat spring planting activity. The price of corn, a key indicator of where fertilizer prices are headed, rallied about 25 per cent from October to February.

But Israel's surprise attack against Iran, which began June 13 and has intensified this week with potential U.S. involvement, has added a geopolitical reason to the mix.

“In terms of how big a deal this is, this is enormous,” said Chris Lawson, head of fertilizers at CRU International Ltd., the Britain-based commodities consultancy, in an e-mail. 

Iran has shut down its seven ammonia and urea production facilities. Israel has halted natural gas exports, which has forced Egypt to halt its urea production, which requires gas. And a potential blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, an essential sea passage for exports, would constrain supply even more.

Egypt and Iran were responsible for nearly 20 per cent of global urea trade last year, according to Mr. Lawson. But add other exporters that use the Strait of Hormuz, and the share of global urea exports now at risk rises to 40 per cent. 

The old argument in favour of investing in fertilizer producers – at least long term – rested on rising demand for global food production and threatened arable land owing to urbanization and climate change. 

The new argument could include global instability.

Nutrien warns Trump's tariffs will hurt U.S. farmers who rely on Canadian potash

Apart from the current problems in the Middle East, the European Union has proposed new tariffs on crop nutrients imported from Russia, a major supplier. 

Joel Jackson, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, noted that two nitrogen plants in Russia may have been hit by Ukrainian drones, halting production.

“So it's not just one war, it's two. And you're not just impacting production, you're impacting logistics,” Mr. Jackson said in an interview.

That should put Nutrien – whose products extend across potash, nitrogen and phosphate produced in Canada and the United States – in a good place.

Yes, the stock comes with a few risks. 

Its gains this year have left some analysts cautious about whether the share price can move much higher. 

The stock's valuation is about midway between its historical five-year average, according to Steve Hansen, an analyst at Raymond James, meaning that it is by no means a screaming bargain. 

As well, rival producers could take advantage of this year's higher fertilizer prices by ramping up production, adding a point against the case for a looming supply crunch. 

In any case, BHP Group Ltd.'s Jansen mine in Saskatchewan is expected to become operational next year, and will become one of the biggest sources of potash when fully operational.

And lastly, the price of corn has been declining since February, as Nutrien's share price has risen. This decoupling is “a dynamic that's rarely proven sustainable,” Mr. Hansen said in a note this week.

If that doesn't make you nervous, then consider Nutrien's volatile share price. From its high in 2022, it fell 33 per cent by the end of the year, and flirted with a four-year low last year, as fertilizer prices meandered at cheap levels. 

Arriving late to a fertilizer rally or holding too long, in other words, can be painful.

Still, Nutrien's share price is below highs reached during other rallies in recent years, and miles off its 2022 peak. That may give the stock some room to run.

If continuing conflict and logistical hurdles keep fertilizer prices elevated, skeptical long-term investors could return to Nutrien as a stable, homegrown commodity producer that can generate consistent profits – potentially increasing the stock's valuation.

Think of it as a kind of safe-haven play: The worse the world gets, the better Nutrien looks.

A meeting between Iran's foreign minister and top European diplomats on Friday yielded hopes of further talks, but no indication of any immediate concrete breakthrough, a week after the crisis centred on the Iranian nuclear program erupted into war between Israel and Tehran.

Foreign ministers from Britain, France and Germany, as well as the European Union's foreign policy chief, emerged from talks at a Geneva hotel about 3 1/2 hours after Iran's Abbas Araghchi arrived for the meeting.

It was the first face-to-face meeting between Western and Iranian officials since the start of the conflict.

“The good result today is that we leave the room with the impression that the Iranian side is fundamentally ready to continue talking about all important issues,” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said. He said the two sides had held “very serious talks.”

British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that “we are keen to continue ongoing discussions and negotiations with Iran, and we urge Iran to continue their talks with the United States.” He added that “we were clear: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.”

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said “we agreed that we will discuss nuclear but also broader issues that we have, and keep the discussions open.“

Opinion: Trump's Iran strategy: Is it TACO or FOMO?

The diplomats gave few details and took no questions.

The United States is considering how to proceed

Lammy travelled to Geneva after meeting in Washington with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff.

Trump has been weighing whether to attack Iran by striking its well-defended Fordow uranium enrichment facility, which is buried under a mountain and widely considered to be out of reach of all but America's “bunker-buster” bombs. He said Wednesday that he'll decide within two weeks whether the U.S. military will get directly involved in the war given the “substantial chance” for renewed negotiations over Tehran's nuclear program.

The White House said on Thursday that President Donald Trump he will decide in the next two weeks whether the U.S. will get involved in the Israel-Iran air war.

Israel says it launched its air strike campaign to stop Iran from getting closer to being able to build a nuclear weapon. Iran and the United States had been negotiating over the possibility of a new diplomatic deal over Tehran's program, though Trump has said Israel's campaign came after a 60-day window he set for the talks.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that “we wanted to open a discussion with the Iranian foreign minister because we believe that there is no definitive solution by military means to the Iranian nuclear problem – military operations may delay it but they can't eliminate it.”

Iran said open to dialogue but no negotiations while attacks continue

Iran's supreme leader rejected U.S. calls for surrender Wednesday and warned that any military involvement by the Americans would cause “irreparable damage to them.”

Before Friday's talks, Araghchi said in an interview aired by Iranian state television that “in the current situation, as the Zionist regime's attacks continue, we are not seeking negotiations with anyone.”

He said that “we have nothing to discuss with the United States, which is a partner in these crimes,” and Tehran rejected negotiations with the Americans.

”As for others, if they seek dialogue, not negotiations, which don't make sense right now, we have no problem with that,” he added. He said that Friday's discussion would focus “solely on the nuclear issue and regional matters” and Iran won't hold talks on its missiles with anyone.

Just before meeting the European diplomats, Araghchi made a brief appearance before the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. He said that Israel's “attacks on nuclear facilities are grave war crimes,” and insisted that “we are entitled and determined to defend our territorial integrity, national sovereignty and security with all force.”

Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though it was the only non-nuclear-armed state to enrich uranium up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

The three European countries played an important role in the negotiations over the original 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. But they have repeatedly threatened to reinstate sanctions that were lifted under the deal if Iran does not improve its co-operation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.

TEL AVIV, June 20. /TASS/. Israeli servicemen hit three missile launchers in Iran, as well as a commander preparing to launch missiles, the army press service reported.

"A short while ago, the Israel Defense Forces struck three ready-to-launch missile launchers aimed at Israeli territory and a military commander who was operating to launch the missiles," the statement said.

Earlier, the Israeli army reported a series of airstrikes on central Tehran that hit dozens of military, industrial, and research facilities. In turn, Iranian Gilan Province Deputy Governor Ali Bagheri said that last night, Israel carried out strikes on the outskirts of the city of Rasht, located on the Caspian Sea coast.

Overnight into June 13, Israel kicked off Operation Rising Lion aimed against Iran's nuclear program. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a retaliatory attack. In the following days, Tel Aviv and Tehran exchanged strikes again. Both sides reported casualties resulting from these attacks and acknowledged hits on several targets within their territories, though they claimed the damage was limited.

Regime change in Iran is "unacceptable" and the assassination of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would "open Pandora's box," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Sky News in an interview published June 20.

Russia, which signed a strategic partnership with Iran in January, has reportedly grown increasingly alarmed as the United States weighs deeper involvement in Israel's military campaign against Tehran. 

Earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested the option of assassinating Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei remains on the table, though he said the U.S. does not plan to act on it "for now." 

The comment followed reporting that Israel had earlier proposed a plan to kill Khamenei — a proposal Trump initially rejected, according to a U.S. official cited by AP.

Peskov warned that any attempt at regime change in Tehran or threats to its leadership would "open Pandora's box," deepening instability across the Middle East and beyond.

"(Regime change in Iran) is unimaginable," Peskov said. "It should be unacceptable, even talking about that should be unacceptable for everyone." He added that the killing of Khamenei would promote extremist sentiment inside Iran and provoke unpredictable consequences.

"The situation is extremely tense and is dangerous not only for the region but globally," Peskov said. "An enlargement of the composition of the participants of the conflict is potentially even more dangerous. It will lead only to another circle of confrontation and escalation of tension in the region."

Russia has been a close regional ally of Iran, while Tehran supplied drones and ballistic missiles for Moscow's war against Ukraine. Meanwhile, Israel has maintained a delicate balance, refraining from joining Western sanctions against Moscow while condemning Iran's role in supporting Russia's war effort.

Asked on whether Moscow would respond to a possible strike against Khamenei, Peskov declined to specify, saying any reaction would come from "inside Iran."

Peskov also commented on Trump's dismissive response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to mediate between Israel and Iran. The U.S. president reportedly told Putin to "mediate your own conflict" in reference to the Russia-Ukraine war. Peskov shrugged off the remark, calling Trump's language "unique" and urging mutual tolerance.

Tensions have risen between the U.S. and Iran following a wave of Israeli air strikes on Iranian territory, beginning June 13. The attacks targeted nuclear infrastructure and senior Iranian commanders, prompting Iranian missile strikes on Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities. 

Tehran claimed that at least 224 Iranian civilians were killed on June 16, though the figures remain unverified.

Russia has offered to mediate the crisis, with Putin reportedly reaching out to both Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Tel Aviv, according to the Kremlin, is reluctant to accept the proposal, while the EU leaders rejected it, citing Russia's aggression in Ukraine and its close military ties to Iran.

ST. PETERSBURG, June 20. /TASS/. Media reports of the US potentially using tactical nuclear weapons against Iran are nothing but speculations, while such a move would lead to catastrophic consequences, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told TASS.

Fox News reporter Jacqui Heinrich said earlier that Washington did not rule out using tactical nuclear weapons to attack Iran's underground uranium enrichment site in Fordow.

"There have been a lot of speculations," Peskov noted. "This would be a catastrophic development, but there are so many speculations that in fact, it's impossible to comment on them," he added.

The New York Times reported earlier, citing sources, that according to the US intelligence community, Tehran might begin developing nuclear weapons if Washington targeted the Fordow facility or if Israel assassinated Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. US intelligence agencies believe that Tehran has not yet made a final decision on creating a nuclear bomb, the newspaper added.

In March, US National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard said that US intelligence agencies saw no signs of Tehran working to develop nuclear weapons. She added that according to her data, Iran's supreme leader had not authorized the resumption of the nuclear weapons program suspended in 2003. Gabbard stressed that the US intelligence community was carefully monitoring Iran's nuclear activities.

President Donald Trump returned to the White House promising to end the war in Ukraine “in 24 hours.” Since then, his administration has badly mishandled diplomatic efforts to bring about a cease-fire. Trump underestimated Russian President Vladimir Putin's determination to subjugate Ukraine and has consequently failed to confront the Kremlin with the coercive pressure needed to stop its ongoing aggression. 

But amid its bungled Ukraine diplomacy, the Trump administration has gotten one important strategic issue right: it is time to take NATO membership for Ukraine off the table. After years of promises to bring Ukraine into the alliance, Washington is finally changing course. In February, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared that “the United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement.”

Taking membership off the table will make it easier to negotiate a cease-fire with Russia, whose legitimate objections to Ukraine's entry into NATO partially motivated its invasion in 2022. And the Trump administration, for its part, is not alone in opposing Ukraine's NATO membership; despite past pledges, a consensus within the alliance to invite Ukraine to join has never emerged and is unlikely to materialize in the foreseeable future. Although they have spent the last three years arming Kyiv, NATO members have not put their own boots on the ground. In doing so, they have made it clear that the alliance does not believe that defending Ukraine should warrant war between NATO and Russia. Pretending otherwise only encourages Kyiv to futilely push for membership, weakening the Ukrainian leadership when it inevitably falls short. Instead, Ukrainians should be pursuing more realistic options for securing their future.

At this year's NATO summit, which takes place next week in The Hague, the alliance should commit to providing Ukraine what it needs to defend itself against Russia. But NATO should also seize the moment to make clear that membership is not in Ukraine's future. Closing the door on Ukraine will allow Kyiv and its supporters to get on with the task of making other plans for providing the country the security it needs and deserves. 

Since the end of the Cold War, the world's most formidable military alliance, which prevailed over the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, has been adding new members to its ranks and moving highly capable forces steadily closer to Russian territory. Over seven waves of enlargement, NATO has grown from 16 members in 1991 to 32 members today. 

Moscow objected to NATO enlargement as soon as the alliance hatched the idea in the early 1990s. In 1993, Russian President Boris Yeltsin warned against the alliance's eastward expansion, arguing that Moscow “would no doubt perceive this as a sort of neo-isolation of our country in diametric opposition to its natural admission into Euro-Atlantic space.” Two years later, Yeltsin was more pointed with U.S. President Bill Clinton: “For me to agree to the borders of NATO expanding towards those of Russia,” Yeltsin proclaimed during a visit by Clinton to Moscow, “would constitute a betrayal on my part of the Russian people.”

Russian disgruntlement has grown in step with NATO's ranks, especially after Putin took office in 1999 and pursued a more confrontational foreign policy. At the 2007 Munich Security Conference, Putin described NATO enlargement as “a serious provocation” and asked, “Why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our borders?” The following year, the George W. Bush administration, despite the objection of Germany and other European allies, convinced NATO to declare at its Bucharest summit that Georgia and Ukraine would become members. Soon thereafter, Russia wrested control of two restive regions of Georgia, effectively preventing the country's accession to NATO. Similarly, Putin's invasions of Ukraine in 2014 and 2022 aimed, at least in part, at blocking its entrance into the alliance. In his address at the beginning of Russia's “special military operation” in Ukraine in February 2022, Putin cited “the fundamental threats which irresponsible Western politicians created for Russia,” singling out “the eastward expansion of NATO, which is moving its military infrastructure ever closer to the Russian border.” 



The United States has consistently dismissed these objections. As he launched the first round of enlargement at NATO's 1997 summit, Clinton argued that NATO's open door would “erase the artificial line in Europe drawn by Stalin at the end of World War II.” Secretary of State Madeleine Albright attempted to assuage Russian concerns by arguing that NATO remained a “defensive alliance that . . . does not regard any state as its adversary,” reassuring Moscow that “NATO poses no danger to Russia.” 

Washington and its allies continued to take this line during successive waves of enlargement and through both Democratic and Republican administrations. Indeed, as Russian troops massed on Ukraine's border in early 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden insisted that “the United States and NATO are not a threat to Russia,” a claim echoed by then NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated that “NATO itself is a defensive alliance. . . . And the idea that Ukraine represents a threat to Russia or, for that matter, that NATO represents a threat to Russia is profoundly wrong and misguided.”

Yet such arguments are either geopolitically naive or disingenuous. It is entirely understandable that Russia is reluctant to allow into its neighborhood an alliance that, although defensive, nonetheless brings to bear ample military power. Whether it is NATO's best tanks and aircraft, long-range strike weapons, or installations collecting intelligence, NATO's arrival in Ukraine would pose a threat to Russia by dint of its sheer proximity. Russia, including its exclave of Kaliningrad, already has five NATO members on its borders and many more in its neighborhood. But given Ukraine's strategic location, size, and historical connections to Russia, Moscow is particularly adamant that it not join NATO's ranks.



Russia is hardly the only major power keen to keep rivals out of its neighborhood. In fact, Moscow's objections to Ukraine's accession to NATO should be readily legible to policymakers in the United States, which has throughout its history made it a priority to expel other great powers from its neighborhood. From the founding era into the twentieth century, Washington used a mix of diplomacy and coercion to push its European rivals out of the Western Hemisphere. Since the late 1800s, it has repeatedly resorted to military intervention to maintain its influence in Latin America. 

Guardianship of the neighborhood continued during the Cold War, with Washington working hard to box the Soviet Union and its ideological sympathizers out of the region. The competition came to a head with the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, which brought the two countries to the brink of war. More recently, State Department spokesperson Ned Price promised that the United States would “respond swiftly and decisively” after Russia mused about again deploying its troops in Latin America in 2022. Its own history fresh in mind, Washington should have been more attentive to Russia's concerns about Ukraine's membership in NATO. 

These arguments by no means justify Russia's 2014 and 2022 invasions of Ukraine, nor do they legitimize Putin's imperial ambitions or his delusions about the unbreakable civilizational ties between Russia and Ukraine. But it is time for U.S. officials to recognize the geopolitical realities staring them in the face. As he explained why “Ukraine coming into NATO is not on the table” in May, Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg admitted that Russian objections were “a fair concern.” Such sobriety and strategic prudence will come in handy as the Trump administration seeks to convince Putin to end the war. 

Ending Ukraine's bid for NATO membership would not only make it easier to negotiate a cease-fire, it would also be to shoot straight with Kyiv instead of continuing to make promises that will likely never be fulfilled. NATO's 2008 declaration that Georgia and Ukraine would eventually become members was a compromise; the Bush administration wanted to move them toward membership, although European leaders feared that doing so would inflame relations with Moscow. The declaration's formulation that the two countries “will become members” was designed to be aspirational and anodyne; NATO set out no timetable or concrete plan for the accession of either country.

But the mild language nonetheless had explosive consequences. Not long after NATO's statement, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili provoked a violent clash with pro-Russian separatists in the South Ossetia region. The incident offered Russia an excuse to send in military forces and grab control of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. NATO barely lifted a finger in response. Saakashvili, in the end, badly overestimated the West's support.

Though it took a different path than Georgia, Ukraine has ended up in a similar position. Heading westward since the 2014 Maidan Revolution and Russia's subsequent invasion of Crimea and the Donbas, Ukrainians enshrined their NATO aspiration in their constitution in 2019. But when Russia invaded again in 2022, although NATO countries rushed weapons to Ukraine, Ukrainian soldiers have been on their own.

Many NATO members understandably feel a moral obligation to continue honoring the pledge to extend membership to Ukraine. But the result has been dashed expectations and growing frustration. After President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a blistering statement calling NATO's unwillingness to move ahead on Ukraine's membership “absurd” at the 2023 summit in Vilnius, NATO edged forward, asserting that “Ukraine's future is in NATO.” Again under pressure from Kyiv, the alliance in 2024 took yet another step, assuring Ukraine that its path to membership was “irreversible.”

But the rhetoric only misleads; Ukraine remains on NATO's doorstep, encouraged to keep waiting outside but never allowed to enter. Kyiv is ultimately better off knowing the hard truth.

Although they have yet to acknowledge it, member states have already taken a decisive step toward closing the door on NATO membership for Ukraine: they have made it clear through their actions that they do not deem it in their interests to go to war with Russia to defend Ukraine. Amid more than three years of fighting, around 500,000 Ukrainians have lost their lives or been wounded valiantly resisting Russia's onslaught. The United States and its partners have provided close to $300 billion in military and economic assistance to Ukraine. But NATO countries have not dispatched a single soldier to join the fight, having concluded that defending Ukraine does not warrant a direct war between NATO and Russia. Their caution extends beyond the refusal to put boots on the ground. Ukraine's NATO patrons have also carefully metered the lethality and range of the weapons provided in order to reduce the risk of escalation with Russia.

Alliance leaders may declare that Ukraine is fighting for the future of the West; that the war represents the frontline in the battle for democracy; that the defense of the rules-based order requires the expulsion of Russian troops from Ukraine; and that if Putin is not defeated in Ukraine, a NATO country could be next. But actions speak louder than words. Led by Washington, NATO has decided that the defense of Ukraine is not worth World War III.

Accordingly, NATO should not extend a security guarantee to Ukraine once the war ends, thereby obligating the alliance to go to war with Russia should it again invade. If Ukraine were attacked by Russia after becoming a NATO member, NATO could, of course, decide not to fight on its behalf. But failure to defend a member state would corrode the alliance's credibility. In short, NATO would find itself in an impossible position: fight a war against Russia it has previously determined not worth fighting or stand down and irreversibly—and perhaps fatally—undermine the Western alliance in the process.

Seeing its bid for NATO membership fail will be a harsh and painful reality for Ukraine as it continues to suffer ruthless Russian attacks. But putting an end to the illusion that Ukraine is on the path to NATO membership is by no means abandoning the country's security. On the contrary, Kyiv will know where it stands, encouraging it to focus on more attainable goals.

Kyiv should concentrate on convincing Washington and other partners to keep the arms coming and make the most of the multiple bilateral security pacts that emerged from negotiations on the margins of NATO's 2023 summit. Ukraine should also expedite its accession to the EU, a process that would speed up economic and political reforms and ultimately give the country at least a version of the security guarantee it seeks; Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union is a mutual defense clause. Moscow has indicated that it can live with Ukraine's integration into the EU, which it sees as a more benign economic and political bloc, not a military alliance. 

The proposal that has emerged from Trump's diplomatic efforts is sound: a cease-fire, with Russia holding on to the roughly 20 percent of Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies. But that deal is acceptable only if the remaining 80 percent of Ukraine emerges as a sovereign, secure, and prosperous democracy. Arriving at that outcome will require that NATO provide Ukraine the military capability, training, and intelligence needed to block further Russian advances, enabling Kyiv to make it clear to Putin that he has already conquered as much of Ukraine as he is going to get. Ukraine is unlikely to give up on restoring its territorial integrity. But that goal should be pursued at the negotiating table with a post-Putin Russia, not on the battlefield. For now, Kyiv should focus on securing a durable cease-fire and turning a free Ukraine into a success story. 

Taking Ukraine's NATO membership off the table will make such a deal much easier to attain. Putin is more likely to end the war if he is confident that Ukraine will not thereafter join NATO. In return, NATO should demand that Russia agree to not only a permanent end to the war but also a renunciation of further territorial claims as well as any restrictions on Ukraine's armed forces and its ability to defend itself.

A NATO consensus behind this plan may be elusive; some members, particularly along NATO's eastern flank, remain keen to bring Ukraine into the alliance. Trump, however, should employ his trademark willingness to say out loud what others are thinking but not dare say, and acknowledge a simple truth: NATO membership for Ukraine is unattainable. He should make it clear that his administration is ready to provide Ukraine the help it needs to defend itself, but that when it comes to the country's accession to NATO, the door is now closed.

Mike Henniger, whose company Illume Student Advisory Services works with colleges in the U.S., Canada and Europe to recruit international students, describes the effects of the Trump Administration's restrictions on foreign students studying in the U.S.

A federal judge on Friday granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration's efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students.

The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs preserves the ability of Harvard to host foreign students while the case is decided. It marks another victory for the Ivy League school as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House.

A federal judge held a brief hearing on California's challenge of the Trump administration's military deployment in Los Angeles.

The hearing followed Trump's key procedural win Thursday in which an appellate court said he can continue deploying the troops while the case plays out.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer put off any more rulings Friday. Instead, he asked for briefings from both sides on whether the Posse Comitatus Act is being violated.

That act prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil.

Breyer also asked the attorneys to address whether he or the appellate court retains primary jurisdiction to grant an injunction.

The president stopped to chat with workers who are busy piling gravel around the Rose Garden outside the White House, where grass has been removed.

The exact conversation couldn't be heard, but Trump spoke to a crew of workers for several minutes.

The exchange came as Trump was heading to Marine One, which was parked on the South Lawn, part of the journey to his Bedminster club in New Jersey where the president will host a Friday evening event for his Maga Inc. super PAC.

Crews began working earlier this month to pave over the once grassy areas near the Rose Garden, just off the Oval Office. Trump also had two towering flagpoles erected outside the White House.

California's challenge of the Trump administration's military deployment on the streets of Los Angeles is back before a federal judge.

Friday's hearing in San Francisco comes after an appeals court handed Trump a key procedural win. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said that for now, Trump can keep control of the California National Guard troops he deployed in response to protests over immigration raids.

Despite the appellate setback, California's attorneys are expected to ask a judge Friday for a preliminary injunction returning control of the troops in Los Angeles, where protests have calmed down in recent days.

Judge Michael Farbiarz made the ruling from the bench in federal court in New Jersey on Friday. Lawyers for the Palestinian activist had asked a federal judge to immediately release him on bail from a Louisiana jail, or else transfer him to New Jersey, where he can be closer to his wife and newborn son.

The same judge had ruled earlier that the government can continue to detain the legal U.S. resident based on allegations that he lied on his green card application. Khalil disputes the accusations that he wasn't forthcoming on the application. The judge previously determined that Khalil couldn't continue being held based on the U.S. secretary of state's determination that he could harm American foreign policy.

Hi Sharon, thanks for your question. This lawsuit over whether Trump can deploy California's National Guard without the approval of California Gov. Gavin Newsom has worked its way through the courts, and, on Thursday, an appellate court ruled in the president's favor. It is the last court before the lawsuit can be appealed to the Supreme Court. Here's some of our reporting from yesterday:

In its decision, a three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded it was likely Trump lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the guard.

It said that while presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's guard, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for doing so, citing violent acts by protesters.

“The undisputed facts demonstrate that before the deployment of the National Guard, protesters ‘pinned down' several federal officers and threw ‘concrete chunks, bottles of liquid, and other objects' at the officers. Protesters also damaged federal buildings and caused the closure of at least one federal building. And a federal van was attacked by protesters who smashed in the van's windows,” the court wrote. “The federal government's interest in preventing incidents like these is significant.”

It also found that even if the federal government failed to notify the governor of California before federalizing the National Guard as required by law, Newsom had no power to veto the president's order.

The court case could have wider implications on the president's power to deploy soldiers within the United States after Trump directed immigration officials to prioritize deportations from other Democratic-run cities.

The justices released six opinions on Friday on everything from California emission standards to a lawsuit filed by victims of terrorism attacks. That leaves 10 cases still to decide, including Trump's executive order denying birthright citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who are in the country illegally. The order has been blocked by lower courts.

The issue before the justices is whether to limit the authority of judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have plagued both Republican and Democratic administrations in the past 10 years. These nationwide court orders have emerged as an important check on Trump's efforts and a source of mounting frustration to the Republican president and his allies.

The Supreme Court is in the homestretch of a term dominated by the Trump administration's emergency appeals of lower court orders seeking to slow the president's efforts to remake the federal government.

A three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded that Trump can likely show that he lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the California National Guard — and that even if the federal government failed to notify the governor of California in advance as required by law, Newsom had no power to veto the president's order.

Trump celebrated the decision on his Truth Social platform, calling it a “BIG WIN.”

He wrote that “all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done.”

The U.S. vice president is traveling to Los Angeles on Friday to meet with Marines and to visit various federal command centers. 

Vance's office did not release a topic of discussion for his visit. But Los Angeles has been the epicenter of protests against the Trump administration's mass deportation operations.

Trump deployed National Guard troops to downtown LA this month in response to the protests. The state sued for a temporary injunction to stop the deployment, but a federal appeals court ruled in Trump's favor Thursday night while that legal challenge continues.

“The 2020 election was a total FRAUD! The evidence is MASSIVE,” Trump posted Friday on his social media site. He added, “A Special Prosecutor must be appointed. This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! Let the work begin!”

Trump has for years claimed, without evidence, that Democrat Joe Biden only won the 2020 election because of widespread voter fraud.

Evidence presented in courts showed this didn't happen — judges, including some appointed by Trump, rejected nearly every claim of widespread fraud as false or frivolous. 

A special prosecutor in Biden's Justice Department investigated Trump's efforts to undermine the 2020 election, but that probe ended when Trump won back the White House in 2024.

U.S. stocks are drifting higher following the Juneteenth holiday. Treasury yields also edged higher in the bond market after Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the U.S. military will get directly involved in Israel's fighting with Iran. 

World shares are mostly higher and crude oil prices have rebounded — U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 52 cents to $75.66 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard added 31 cents to $77.01 per barrel. Oil prices have been gyrating as fears rise and ebb that war could disrupt the global flow of crude. 

“The stock market's risk premium isn't just rising — it's recalibrating for a world where every macro lever now doubles as a tripwire,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management wrote in a commentary, adding that traders are bracing for what comes next.

Trump's tariffs agenda may have been eclipsed by the conflict in the Middle East, but it remains another major factor weighing on markets, Innes said: “A delayed fuse is still a fuse.”

Trump on Thursday signed an executive order to keep TikTok running in the U.S. for an additional 90 days, giving his administration more time to broker a deal that would bring the social media platform under American ownership.

Trump disclosed the executive order on the Truth Social platform Thursday morning.

The first extension was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban — approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court — took effect. The second was in April when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump's tariff announcement.

It is not clear how many times Trump can — or will — keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far there have been no legal challenges to fight them.

We'll answer a few each day during our live coverage.

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier joins ‘America Reports' to explain why he was held in civil contempt of court over a state immigration law.

City commissioners in Miami, Florida, voted 3-2 on Tuesday to allow police officers to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 

The city entered a 287(g) partnership with ICE, which various cities use to assist with federal enforcement using different methods. It's a sharp contrast to some governments throughout the United States, especially in major cities, which do not allow local or state authorities to help enforce immigration laws.  

"We value our partnerships with state and local law enforcement, and the success of the 287(g) program allows for a force multiplier in enforcing immigration laws," an ICE spokesperson said in a statement. "This whole-of-government approach enables law enforcement partners to protect cities across the nation from public safety and national security threats, and we encourage others across the country to join."

In February, Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an Executive Order for state-level law enforcement to establish agreements with ICE to assist in the Trump administration's deportation efforts.

"Florida is setting the example for states in combating illegal immigration and working with the Trump Administration to restore the rule of law," DeSantis said at the time. "By allowing our state agents and law enforcement officers to be trained and approved by ICE, Florida will now have more enforcement personnel deputized to assist federal partners. That means deportations can be carried out more efficiently, making our communities safer as illegal aliens are removed."

However, there was opposition to entering the agreement from some residents and groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Florida Immigrant Coalition.

"This is a shameful day for Miami," Dariel Gomez, Statewide Organizer with the ACLU of Florida said in a press release. "With their vote, commissioners chose fear over facts, and division over unity. This agreement will not make us safer – it will only spread fear and isolate the very people who make our city strong."

"287(g) doesn't belong in any city, but especially not in Miami – a place shaped by immigrants, built by immigrants, and powered by immigrants," Tessa Petit, Executive Director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in a statement. "More than half of our residents are foreign-born. The commissioners who voted to implement this ruthless program have turned their back on the very community they were put into office to protect. They are turning our diversity into a target."

However, the White House told Fox News Digital the city's decision was ultimately the right move.

"President Trump's promise to deport illegal aliens is a key plank of his agenda to Make America Safe Again. The Administration is always grateful to work with state and local officials to get dangerous criminals off the streets and keep the American people safe." Abigail Jackson, White House spokeswoman, stated.

In April, a massive ICE operation in collaboration with Florida authorities led to the arrest of 1,120 illegal immigrants, and the agency said 63% of them had "existing criminal arrests or convictions," and many had alleged gang affiliations.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — California's challenge of the Trump administration's military deployment in Los Angeles returned to a federal courtroom in San Francisco on Friday for a brief hearing after an appeals court handed President Donald Trump a key procedural win.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer put off issuing any additional rulings and instead asked for briefings from both sides on whether the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil, is being violated in Los Angeles.

Newsom said in his complaint that “violation of the Posse Comitatus Act is imminent, if not already underway” but Breyer last week postponed considering that allegation.

The hearing comes a day after the 9th Circuit appellate panel allowed the president to keep control of National Guard troops he deployed in response to protests over immigration raids. 

The appellate decision halted a temporary restraining order from Breyer, who found Trump acted illegally when he activated the soldiers over opposition from California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Despite the appellate setback, California's attorneys are expected to ask Breyer on Friday for a preliminary injunction returning control of the troops in Los Angeles, where protests have calmed down in recent days, to Newsom.

Trump, a Republican, argued that the troops have been necessary to restore order. Newsom, a Democrat, said their presence on the streets of a U.S. city inflamed tensions, usurped local authority and wasted resources. 




The demonstrations have appeared to be winding down, although dozens of protesters showed up Thursday at Dodger Stadium, where a group of federal agents in SUVs and cargo vans had gathered with their faces covered a parking lot. The Los Angeles Dodgers organization asked them to leave, and they did.

On Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass lifted a curfew in downtown Los Angeles that was first imposed in response to vandalism and clashes with police after crowds gathered in opposition to agents taking migrants into detention.

Breyer found that Trump had overstepped his legal authority, which he said allows presidents to control state National Guard troops only during times of “rebellion or danger of a rebellion.”

“The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of ‘rebellion,'” wrote Breyer, a Watergate prosecutor who was appointed by President Bill Clinton and is the brother of retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.

The Trump administration argued that courts can't second-guess the president's decisions. The appellate panel ruled otherwise, saying presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's guard, but said that by citing violent acts by protesters in this case, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for federalizing the troops. 

For now, the California National Guard will stay in federal hands as the lawsuit proceeds. It's the first deployment by a president of a state National Guard without the governor's permission since troops were sent to protect Civil Rights Movement marchers in 1965.

Trump celebrated the appellate ruling in a social media post, calling it a “BIG WIN” and hinting at more potential deployments. “All over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done,” Trump wrote.

Newsom, for his part, has also warned that California won't be the last state to see troops in the streets if Trump gets his way. “The President is not a king and is not above the law. We will press forward with our challenge to President Trump's authoritarian use of U.S. military soldiers against citizens,” Newsom said.

Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance was traveling to Los Angeles on Friday to meet with U.S. Marines who also have been deployed to protect federal buildings, his office announced.

Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Hunter Bigge was carted off the field at George M. Steinbrenner Field in a terrifying scene after the reliever was struck in the face by a foul ball in Thursday night's game against the Baltimore Orioles. 

Bigge was struck by a 105-mph ball off the bat of Orioles catcher Adley Rutschman at the top of the seventh inning. The ball, heading straight for the dugout, struck Bigge on the right side of his face.

"Certainly you feel for Hunter and his wife. I can't imagine what she and he were going through," Rays manager Kevin Cash said, via MLB.com. "Scary for everybody, none more than them."

He was taken to a hospital for further evaluation, but Cash said Bigge never lost consciousness and was able to speak with first responders. 

The game was delayed by eight minutes, but the scary scene left fans and players in a state of shock.

"It's really scary, it's terrifying. We sit in these dugouts every night, and, in a lot of ways, you kind of feel like a sitting duck," Orioles interim manager Tony Mansolino said after the game. "It's just terrifying."

Rutschman echoed that sentiment, adding that he's "praying" for the best. 

"I saw it [come] off my bat, and it was just really, really scary. I'm praying for him and for his recovery, hope he's doing OK. I'm just – it's scary," he told reporters in the locker room. "You never want to see that. I think everyone wishes for the best health for everyone in this game, and you hate to see that. I hope he's doing OK."

Live Updates


• Diplomacy window: US President Donald Trump said he will allow two weeks for diplomacy before deciding whether to launch a strike in Iran. Meanwhile, Iran's foreign minister says his country is “not seeking negotiations with anyone, especially not with the United States,” as he meets with European officials in Geneva. Though US officials are skeptical of the talks, a White House official kept the door open to progress.
    


• On the ground: Iran launched a fresh barrage of missiles toward Israel today, with at least one missile striking the northern city of Haifa. This latest attack comes as Iran and Israel traded strikes overnight, with no signs of de-escalation in their weeklong conflict.



• Israel threatens Iran's leader: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out targeting Iran's supreme leader, saying “no one in Iran should have immunity,” after Israel's defense minister said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cannot be allowed to “continue to exist.”
    


            The director of the International Agency for Atomic Energy warned on Friday that a direct attack on Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant would result in “a very high release of radioactivity” that would affect people within hundreds of kilometers of the plant.
    


            Addressing the UN Security Council, Rafael Grossi said that Bushehr was “the nuclear site in Iran where the consequences of an attack could be most serious.” He said that as an operating nuclear power plant, Bushehr holds “thousands of kilograms of nuclear material.”
    


            Bushehr's location in southern Iran means it is closer to the capital cities of several US allies in the region than it is to Tehran, and Grossi said countries in the region have reached out directly to him to express their concern.
    


                    “I want to make it absolutely and completely clear. In case of an attack on the Bushehr nuclear power plant, a direct hit would result in a very high release of radioactivity to the environment,” he said.
                





            Grossi added that an attack that would disable the plant's power supply lines could cause its reactor's core to melt, which could also result a very high release of radioactivity.
    


            He warned that people within hundreds of kilometers of the plant would be at risk from the radiation, adding that evacuations, iodine treatments and food controls could be necessary in case of an attack.
    


            Israel has destroyed half of Iran's missile launchers, according to the Israeli military's chief of staff, who warned his country must be prepared for prolonged military action.
    


            In comments made in a recorded message, Eyal Zamir lauded the Israel Defense Forces' recent strikes on Iran. “Thanks to a powerful and surprising opening strike, we achieved extraordinary results,” he said.
    


            As well as eliminating Iran's senior military command and dealing significant blows to its nuclear program, Israel had destroyed surface-to-air missile batteries and around half of its missile launchers, some just “minutes” before launch, Zamir said.
    


                    But he warned Israel “must be ready for a prolonged campaign” to “remove a threat of such magnitude, against such an enemy.”
                





            He continued that pilots from Israel's air force are “operating at the greatest range and intensity in the forces' history” to strike Iran in “powerful” waves of attacks.
    


            Zamir also tied Israel's operations in Iran to the 53 remaining hostages who were taken by Hamas on October 7, 2023. 



                    “Bringing them home is a moral and national imperative, and the IDF is working tirelessly to achieve it. The operations we are conducting in Iran these days are also contributing to that goal,” he said. 
                





            He added that Israel is preparing for a wide range of possible developments.
    


            “The campaign is not over. Although we have made significant achievements, difficult days still lie ahead,” he added.
    


Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly described how Zamir's message was delivered. He spoke in a recorded video.



            The Trump administration on Friday sanctioned several foreign companies, a Chinese individual and a cargo ship to undercut Iran's military capabilities as its conflict with Israel rages on.
    


            The Treasury Department said in a statement that the sanctioned businesses and individual supplied Iran with “sensitive machinery” and research “that underpin the regime's ballistic missile, unmanned aerial vehicle, and asymmetric weapons programs.”
    


            The Trump administration said Chinese national Zhang Yanbang, the shipmaster of the Shun Kai Xing, “was aware” there was military machinery on the vessel headed to Iran. The Shun Kai Xing is a cargo ship that was identified as “blocked property” by the US Treasury Department.
    


                    “The United States remains resolved to disrupt any effort by Iran to procure the sensitive, dual-use technology, components, and machinery that underpin the regime's ballistic missile, unmanned aerial vehicle, and asymmetric weapons programs. We have been clear: those who enable these schemes will be held accountable,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.
                





            Israel expects the European officials currently meeting with their Iranian counterparts in Geneva, Switzerland, to “demand a complete rollback” of the Iranian nuclear program, an Israeli diplomatic source told CNN on Friday.
    


            “Israel is not a part of this meeting,” the source said.
    


            “We expect the European foreign ministers to take a firm stance vis-a-vis Iran and demand a complete rollback of the nuclear program, the dismantling of its ballistic missile arsenal and program, and putting an end to its regional terrorist activities and active support for its terrorist proxies.”
    


            The United Kingdom has decided to temporarily withdraw its embassy staff from Iran because of the “current security situation” in the country, according to the British foreign office.
    


            “Due to the current security situation, we have taken the precautionary measure to temporarily withdraw our UK staff from Iran. Our embassy continues to operate remotely,” a spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said.
    


            “We take the protection of our staff and British nationals extremely seriously and we have long advised against all travel to Iran,” the spokesperson continued.
    


            Protesters took to the streets of central Tehran to demonstrate against Israel's strikes on Iran as well as US President Donald Trump's administration.
    


CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports what he sees on the ground:



            Diplomacy with Iran can “easily” be started again if US President Donald Trump orders Israel's leadership to stop its strikes on Iran, Majid Farahani, an official with Iran's presidency, told CNN.
    


            “Iran believes in civilian dialogue,” he said. “Directly or indirectly is not important.”
    


                    “President Trump can easily stop the war by only one telephone [call] to [the] Israelis,” he said, repeating the Iranian position that talks were impossible while Israeli bombs were striking Iran.
                





            Farahani said that Iran would not support halting nuclear enrichment — which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes — but added that concessions were possible.
    


                    “Maybe it can be lower, but we don't stop it,” he said.
                





Some context: In recent days, European powers have joined American and Israeli calls for a ban on enrichment, hardening their positions on the key issue, with France putting forward “a clear position on zero enrichment,” France's foreign ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine told CNN today.
    


            Iran says it needs enriched uranium for peaceful purposes, while also manufacturing large quantities of near-weapons-grade material.
    


            Trump's decision to open a two-week negotiating window before deciding on striking Iran has offered a slim — if improbable — path to a peace deal between Iran and Israel.
    


            Talks are taking place in Geneva between the foreign ministers from Iran, France, and Germany, along with the EU's foreign policy chief, the first confirmed face-to-face meeting of its kind since the conflict began.
    


            After days of increasingly aggressive messages from the Trump administration, it has opened the possibility that military action can be averted.
    


            Indeed, Trump's own camp appears to be starkly divided on whether to pursue direct strikes against Iran.
    


            “If America gets involved in the war,” Farahani said, “there are so many options, and all those options are on the table.”

CNN's Fred Pleitgen is the first western journalist to enter Iran since the latest conflict with Israel started. He interviewed Majid Farahani, an official with the Iranian presidency, about the escalating tensions with Israel, Iran's nuclear program and what happens if the US gets directly involved in the conflict. #cnn #news 


Correction: An earlier version of this post included the wrong title for Farahani. He is an official with the Iranian presidency.



            The Iranian and European officials currently meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, spoke for around an hour and a half before taking a break, a Western European diplomat told CNN on Friday afternoon.
    


            The two sides are now consulting in separate rooms, with direct talks expected to resume shortly, the official said.
    


            Nearly two dozen people were wounded in parts of Israel on Friday, emergency services said, after Iran unleashed a fresh barrage of missiles.
    


            At least 23 people were injured, Israel's Magen David Adom (MDA) said. A 16-year-old boy, and two men aged 54 and 40, were among those seriously injured with shrapnel. In the northern city of Karmiel, a woman died after she suffered a heart attack inside a shelter, the MDA added.
    


            Paramedics and eyewitnesses described scenes of people bleeding in the streets, after they were dispatched to several neighborhoods in northern Israel.
    


                    “We heard a very loud noise and felt a blast wave. When I exited the shelter, I saw that the windows in my house were shattered, and there was a lot of broken glass,” Ahmed Zidan said in an MDA press release.
                





            “I saw heavy smoke and massive destruction in the building near the parking area that was hit by the rocket,” Zidan added.
    


            Iran said the latest attack targeted “military objectives, defense industries, and command centers” in Israel, a spokesperson for the country's revolutionary guard said, according to state media.
    


            The “name of the game is peace,” the mayor of the northern Israeli city of Haifa told CNN on Friday, as he suggested the two-week deadline set by President Donald Trump to decide on whether the US will join Israel's military action on Iran is too long.
    


            Speaking to CNN's Nic Robertson from the city in the aftermath of a fresh Iranian missile barrage, Mayor Yona Yahav confirmed that no one had been killed. According to Israeli emergency services, a total of 21 people were injured in Haifa during the attacks, including three with severe injuries.
    


            Yahav also said “I don't like wars,” after having personally experienced 10 of them, adding that the “name of the game is peace.”
    


            He said his culturally mixed city has been a mostly peaceful home to both Jews and Arabs for over 100 years.
    


            When asked about the talks that are being held in Geneva between Iran and European countries, Yahav said he hoped that a peace treaty would be the ultimate end result.
    


            The mayor said that the two-week deadline US President Donald Trump had given to decide US actions on Iran was “too much,” as he said it is difficult for residents to live while wrapped up in war.
    


            “A fixed answer I can't get from Trump, and this bothers me,” he said.
    


            “Because I like stability, and I think that he has to give me this stability.”
    


            In the midst of a conflict with Israel, Iranians still have extremely limited online access 48 hours after Iran imposed internet restrictions.
    


            Internet connectivity plummeted to just 3% on Wednesday afternoon and has remained low since then, according to data from Netblocks, a non-governmental organization monitoring internet governance.
    


            The blackout happened a day after Iran's Bank Sepah was hit with a cyberattack claimed by an Israel-linked hacking group, which took ATMs out of service.
    


            Iran has experienced partial internet outages since Israeli strikes began a week ago, with the number of people connected to the internet declining as residents evacuate major cities like Tehran, and businesses close.
    


            Talks are underway in Geneva between Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi and counterparts from France, Germany and Britain along with the EU's foreign policy chief.
    


            Ahead of the meeting, Britain's Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, said a “window now exists” to end the escalating crisis in the Middle East, a reference to US President Donald Trump's announcement that he would allow two weeks for diplomacy before deciding on whether to launch a US strike on Iran.
    


            It's the first confirmed face-to-face meeting between Western and Iranian officials since the start of the conflict, but chances of a swift breakthrough appear slim.
    


            At least 17 people were wounded in Israel on Friday after Iran launched a fresh missile salvo, according to health and emergency officials.
    


            At least three of those were seriously injured, including a 16-year-old boy, who was hit by shrapnel, local authorities said.
    


            Footage released by Israel's Rambam hospital showed paramedics carrying an injured person on a stretcher, into the courtyard of the health facility in the port city of Haifa.
    


            Emergency services told residents they could leave “protected spaces” in the city, indicating the threat of Iranian missiles had so far passed.

            Residents in the northern Israeli city of Haifa ran for cover in an underground parking lot below a shopping mall, a CNN team on the ground witnessed, amid a fresh Iranian missile attack on Friday.
    


            Speaking from the city, CNN's Nic Robertson described following people to a shopping mall from the streets as the sirens began to sound. “The sirens went off so we looked around us, followed people who were leaving the street… because people here know where the underground shelters are.”
    


            The team followed people into a mall, he said, before going down multiple levels to come out into the parking lot.
    


            Citizens could be seen sheltering in the car park, with many of them on their phones to check for updates on the situation above ground.
    


            Iran fired a fresh barrage of missiles towards northern, central and southern Israel on Friday, according to the Israeli military.

            Iranian missiles impacted several sites across Israel on Friday, according to fire and rescue teams, prompting bomb disposal teams to be despatched.
    


            The northern port city of Haifa was among those hit, as well as the northernmost Dan district, the emergency services added.
    


            Social media footage on Friday showed a large plume of smoke rising over buildings in Haifa. The booming sound of explosions can be heard.
    


            Iran fired a fresh barrage of missiles toward northern, central and southern Israel on Friday, according to the Israeli military.
    


            Sirens sounded across the country, the Israeli military said, adding that its air forces were “operating to intercept and strike where necessary to eliminate the threat.”
    


            The military instructed residents to “enter a protected space and remain there until further notice.”
    


            Emergency services are reporting to scenes where impacts are reported.
    


            Thousands of Iraqis took to the streets of Baghdad and other cities on Friday after powerful cleric Muqtada al-Sadr called for mass demonstrations against the conflict between Israel and Iran.
    


            Images released from al-Sadr's media office showed large crowds gathered in the Sadr City district of Iraq's capital, Baghdad, following Friday prayers.
    


            Many protesters could be seen holding umbrellas to shield themselves from the summer sun. At a separate demonstration in Iraq's central province of Najaf, a large banner read: “No to Israel.”
    


            One demonstrator in Baghdad, a 54-year-old taxi driver named Abu Hussein, told news agency AFP that Israel had “no right” to attack Iran. “It is an unjust war,” he said, adding: “Israel is not in it for the (Iranian) nuclear (program). What Israel and the Americans want is to dominate the Middle East.”
    


            The Saudi nuclear regulator has warned that any attack on nuclear facilities intended for peaceful purposes is a violation of international law.
    


                    “Any armed attack by any party, or any threat targeting nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes, constitutes a violation of international resolutions, the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law, and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency,” the Saudi Nuclear and Radiological Regulatory Commission said on X on Friday.
                





Why this matters: Concern has been rising in Gulf Arab states about the possibility of environmental contamination or reprisal attacks if Israel or the United States strike Iran's nuclear facilities just across the Persian Gulf.
    


            Iran's only functional nuclear power plant, in Bushehr, is closer to several US-allied Arab capitals than to Tehran. Israel has not targeted it in its strikes at Iran's nuclear facilities.
    


            France, Germany and the United Kingdom are ready to make an offer to Iran for “complete negotiations,” French President Emmanuel Macron said just hours before a high-stakes diplomatic meeting gets underway in Switzerland.
    


            Macron warned there should be “no laxity” when it comes to managing the prospect of an “Iran endowed with nuclear arms,” speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a French defense show on Friday.
    


                    “A return to negotiations must be absolutely prioritized, including nuclear — moving towards zero enrichment, ballistics for limiting the abilities and capacities of the Iranians and the financing of all the terrorist groups that destabilize the region,” Macron said.
                





            Macron's foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, and his German and British counterparts will make an “offer for complete negotiations: diplomatic and technical” to the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, Macron said.
    


            The meeting between the three European nations and Iran is scheduled to kick off at 3 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) in the Swiss city of Geneva.
    


More on Iran talks: Barrot briefed Secretary of State Marco Rubio Thursday on the Europeans' “planned approach” for the meeting with the Iranian foreign minister Friday, a French diplomat told CNN.
    


            Rubio, according to this diplomat, emphasized during call that the US is “ready for direct contact with the Iranians at any time.”
    


            Barrot and Rubio agreed to hold a follow up call on Friday to discuss the Geneva meeting and continue coordination, the diplomat said.
    


This post has been updated with additional information. 



            Thousands of Iranians took to the streets of Tehran and other cities on Friday to protest against Israel, with many waving flags and chanting anti-Western slogans.
    


            Images on Iranian state TV showed large crowds of people walking through the streets of the capital, Tehran. Some carried images of Iranian commanders who have been killed by Israel since the start of the conflict.
    


            Others waved flags from Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group — one of Iran's key regional allies.
    


            Footage from Iran's semi-official Tasnim News Agency showed protesters chanting anti-Israel and anti-British slogans.

            Cybercriminals have breached insurance giant Aflac, potentially stealing Social Security numbers, insurance claims and health information, the company said Friday, the latest in a spree of hacks against the insurance industry.
    


            With billions of dollars in annual revenue and tens of millions of customers, Aflac is the biggest victim yet in the ongoing digital assault on US insurance companies that has the industry on edge and the FBI and private cyber experts scrambling to contain the fallout.
    


            Erie Insurance and Philadelphia Insurance Companies have also reported hacks this month, which in those cases have caused widespread disruptions to IT systems used to serve customers. All three insurance-company hacks are consistent with the techniques of a young and rampant cybercrime group known as Scattered Spider, people familiar the investigation tell CNN.
    


            “This attack, like many insurance companies are currently experiencing, was caused by a sophisticated cybercrime group,” Aflac said in a statement on Friday, without naming Scattered Spider. Aflac said it “stopped the intrusion within hours” after discovering it last week, that no ransomware was deployed, and that it continues to serve its customers.
    


            It was too early to tell, the company said, how much customer information may have been stolen, but the potential exposure is vast. Aflac is one of the largest providers of supplemental health insurance in the US for medical expenses that aren't covered by a primary provider.
    


            The hackers used “social engineering” to worm their way into its network, according to Aflac. That tactic can involve duping someone into revealing security information to help gain access to a network. It's a hallmark of Scattered Spider attackers, who are known to pose as tech support to infiltrate big corporations.
    


            The loose group of cybercriminals is considered dangerous and unpredictable, in part because it is believed to be comprised of youths in the US and the UK known for aggressively extorting their victims. Scattered Spider shot to infamy in September 2023 when they were linked to a pair of multimillion-dollar hacks on famous Las Vegas casinos and hotels MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment.
    


            The hackers' tactics, and the way they target big swaths of American industries at a time, has cybersecurity executives pleading with companies to be wary of suspicious phone calls to their employees. Just last month, they were suspects in multiple cyberattacks on American retail companies.
    


            “If Scattered Spider is targeting your industry, get help immediately,” said Cynthia Kaiser, who until last month was deputy assistant director of the FBI's Cyber Division and oversaw FBI teams investigating the hackers. “They can execute their full attacks in hours. Most other ransomware groups take days.”
    


            Scattered Spider often registers web domains that look very much like trusted help desks that companies use for IT support, the cybersecurity firm Halcyon, where Kaiser now works, says in a forthcoming report.
    


            While concerns about Iranian cyber capabilities are in the news because of the Israel-Iran war, “the threat I lose sleep over is Scattered Spider,” said John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google's Threat Intelligence Group. “They are already taking food off shelves and freezing businesses. The Iranian hackers may not even have Internet access, but these kids are in play right now.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses President Donald Trump weighing U.S. involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.

President Donald Trump has reported to the West Wing's Situation Room multiple times in recent days as the conflict in Iran comes to a rolling boil and the U.S. considers launching its own attacks on the Islamic Republic over mounting concerns it could produce a nuclear weapon in a short span of time. 

"Yes, I may do it. I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do. I can tell you this that Iran's got a lot of trouble, and they want to negotiate," Trump told reporters Wednesday on the U.S. potentially striking Iran as it continues trading deadly strikes with Israel. "And I said, why didn't you negotiate with me before all this death and destruction? Why didn't you go? I said to people, why didn't you negotiate with me two weeks ago? You could have done fine. You would have had a country. It's very sad to watch this."

Fox News Digital spoke to previous presidential administration officials — Fox News host and former Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who served under the first Trump administration, and former National Security Advisor under the first Trump administration John Bolton, who also served as ambassador to the U.N. under President George W. Bush's administration. They both conveyed the serious and historic tone the room and its meetings typically hold. 

The Situation Room is a high-tech 5,000-square-foot complex in the West Wing of the White House that includes multiple conference rooms. President John F. Kennedy commissioned the complex in 1961 following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion to overthrow the Castro regime in Cuba that same year, according to the National Archives. The complex was built in order to provide future presidents a dedicated area for crisis management, and was revamped in 2006 and renovated again in 2023. 

TRUMP WEIGHS STRIKING IRANIAN NUCLEAR FACILITIES: 'I MAY DO IT, I MAY NOT DO IT'

"I often would sit there and think about the Osama bin Laden raid," McEnany told Fox News Digital in a phone interview Thursday morning. "This is where we saw our heroic Special Forces take out Osama bin Laden during the Obama administration. And I think we're at another point where similar decisions are being made, and even bigger decisions that may change the course of history are happening right now in that room."

Trump again held a meeting in the Situation Room Thursday morning, when he received an intelligence briefing with national security advisers, which followed a Situation Room meeting on Wednesday afternoon, another meeting on Tuesday afternoon with national security advisers and a Monday evening meeting upon his abrupt return from the G7 summit in Canada this week. 

Top national security officials, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, are among officials who have joined Trump in the meetings as the administration weighs the spiraling conflict.

Bolton explained to Fox Digital in a Thursday morning phone interview that two types of top-level meetings are held in the Situation Room. 

The first is known as a "principals meeting," he said, which includes Cabinet secretaries, such as the secretary of state and secretary of defense, and is chaired by the national security advisor — a role currently filled by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

"The principals committee usually meets to try and get everything sorted out so that they know what decisions the president is going to be confronted with," Bolton said. "They try and make sure all the information is pulled together so we can make an informed decision, set out the options they see, what the pros and cons are, and then have (the president) briefed."

The second type of Situation Room meeting at the top level are official National Security Council meetings, which the president chairs.

"He chairs a full NSC meeting, and people review the information, update the situation, and the president can go back and forth with the advisors about asking questions, probing about the analysis, asking for more detail on something, kind of picking and choosing among the options, or suggesting new options," said Bolton, who served as Trump's national security advisor between April 2018 and September 2019. 

"And out of that could well come decisions," he added.

McEnany served as the first Trump administration's top spokeswoman at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the Coronavirus Task Force operated out of the Situation Room as COVID-19 swept across the nation. 

"A lot of critical decisions were made during the pandemic," she said. "It's a humbling encounter. Every time you go in, you leave your phone at the door. You go in, I think it's like 5,000 square feet, you're sitting there, there's clocks up from every country around the world, the different time zones. And you're just sitting there as critical decisions are made. And, in my case, it was regarding the pandemic, and there's back and forth, there's deliberation, and these decisions are made with the president there, obviously."

She continued that during the pandemic, the task force would spend hours in the Situation Room on a daily basis as the team fielded an onslaught of updates from across the country. Trump frequently received the top lines from the meetings and joined the Situation Room during key decisions amid the spread of the virus. 

"When he was in there, absolutely, there's a deference," she said, referring to how the tone of the room would change upon Trump's arrival. "Yet, you had key officials who spoke up, who were not afraid to give their point of view to him. But I think there's a recognition he's the commander in chief."

Press secretaries typically do not attend high-profile National Security Council meetings in the Situation Room, but have security clearances and can call into the room if needed, and are given updates from senior officials. 

McEnany added that press secretaries wouldn't typically want to be in the room for high-stakes talks because "you don't want your head filled with these sensitive deliberations of classified information" when speaking with the media.

Bolton explained that for an issue such as Iran, the Situation Room meetings are likely restrictive and include top national security officials, such as the secretary of defense, director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 

"Sometimes it includes many more people, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Commerce Secretary, things like that," he said. "But in with this kind of decision, it could be very restrictive, so maybe just – well, there is no national security advisor – but, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Director of National Intelligence, CIA Director, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, maybe the attorney general."

Trump's first national security advisor under the second administration, Mike Waltz, was removed from the role and nominated as the next U.S. ambassador to the UN in May, with Rubio taking on the additional role. The White House has also slashed NSC staffing since Trump took office, including after Rubio took the helm. 

ISRAEL'S 'RESOUNDING' MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAN COULD BE HISTORIC TURNING POINT, EXPERTS SAY

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt held a press conference on Thursday — the first since Israel launched preemptive strikes on Iran June 12 — and said the next two weeks will be a critical time period as U.S. officials map out next steps.

"I have a message directly from the president, and I quote: 'Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future. I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.' That's a quote directly from the president," she said Thursday. 

Israel launched pre-emptive strikes on Iran June 12 after months of attempted and stalled nuclear negotiations and subsequent heightened concern that Iran was advancing its nuclear program. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared soon afterward that the strikes were necessary to "roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival."

He added that if Israel had not acted, "Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time." 

Dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," the strikes targeted Iran's nuclear and missile infrastructure and killed a handful of senior Iranian military leaders.

Trump repeatedly has urged Iran to make a deal on its nuclear program, but the country pulled out of ongoing talks with the U.S. scheduled for Sunday in Oman.

"Iran should have signed the ‘deal' I told them to sign," Trump posted to Truth Social Monday evening, when he abruptly left an ongoing G7 summit in Canada to better focus on the Israel–Iran conflict. "What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!"

Leavitt added during Thursday's briefing that Trump is the "peacemaker-in-chief," while noting that he is also not one to shy from flexing America's strength.

"The president is always interested in a diplomatic solution to the problems in the global conflicts in this world. Again, he is a peacemaker in chief. He is the peace-through-strength president. And so, if there's a chance for diplomacy, the president's always going to grab it. But he's not afraid to use strength as well," she said. 

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for additional comment on the high-level talks but did not immediately receive a reply.

"I've never had any issues for any of the teams I've played for. This guy crossed the line a few times."

He was pressed further but declined to elaborate on what prompted him to jump and swing at the fan in the stands.  

"He crossed the line, and I'd like to leave it at that. I've never had anything like this happen in my eight years in baseball."

Multiple videos shared online showed Santana approaching the area where the fan was standing. He appeared to be standing next to a security guard or officer and pointed in the direction of the fan before leaping and taking a swing. He was pulled back by a teammate before leaving the bullpen. 

A Detroit Tigers spokesperson confirmed to The Athletic that the fan was ejected from the game. 

Santana said he spoke to manager Don Kelly and expressed "regret" for his reaction, adding, "You know I'm a professional."

An appeals court on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump to keep control of National Guard troops he deployed to Los Angeles following protests over immigration raids. The decision halts a ruling from a lower court judge who found Trump acted illegally when he activated the soldiers over opposition from California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

The three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded it was likely Trump lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the Guard. It said that while presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's Guard, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for doing so and that Newsom had no power to veto the president's order.

Hi Sharon, thanks for your question. This lawsuit over whether Trump can deploy California's National Guard without the approval of California Gov. Gavin Newsom has worked its way through the courts, and, on Thursday, an appellate court ruled in the president's favor. It is the last court before the lawsuit can be appealed to the Supreme Court. Here's some of our reporting from yesterday:

In its decision, a three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded it was likely Trump lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the guard.

It said that while presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's guard, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for doing so, citing violent acts by protesters.

“The undisputed facts demonstrate that before the deployment of the National Guard, protesters ‘pinned down' several federal officers and threw ‘concrete chunks, bottles of liquid, and other objects' at the officers. Protesters also damaged federal buildings and caused the closure of at least one federal building. And a federal van was attacked by protesters who smashed in the van's windows,” the court wrote. “The federal government's interest in preventing incidents like these is significant.”

It also found that even if the federal government failed to notify the governor of California before federalizing the National Guard as required by law, Newsom had no power to veto the president's order.

The court case could have wider implications on the president's power to deploy soldiers within the United States after Trump directed immigration officials to prioritize deportations from other Democratic-run cities.

The justices released six opinions on Friday on everything from California emission standards to a lawsuit filed by victims of terrorism attacks. That leaves 10 cases still to decide, including Trump's executive order denying birthright citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who are in the country illegally. The order has been blocked by lower courts.

The issue before the justices is whether to limit the authority of judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have plagued both Republican and Democratic administrations in the past 10 years. These nationwide court orders have emerged as an important check on Trump's efforts and a source of mounting frustration to the Republican president and his allies.

The Supreme Court is in the homestretch of a term dominated by the Trump administration's emergency appeals of lower court orders seeking to slow the president's efforts to remake the federal government.

A three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded that Trump can likely show that he lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the California National Guard — and that even if the federal government failed to notify the governor of California in advance as required by law, Newsom had no power to veto the president's order.

Trump celebrated the decision on his Truth Social platform, calling it a “BIG WIN.”

He wrote that “all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done.”

▶ Read more on developments following the appellate ruling

The U.S. vice president is traveling to Los Angeles on Friday to meet with Marines and to visit various federal command centers. 

Vance's office did not release a topic of discussion for his visit. But Los Angeles has been the epicenter of protests against the Trump administration's mass deportation operations.

Trump deployed National Guard troops to downtown LA this month in response to the protests. The state sued for a temporary injunction to stop the deployment, but a federal appeals court ruled in Trump's favor Thursday night while that legal challenge continues.

“The 2020 election was a total FRAUD! The evidence is MASSIVE,” Trump posted Friday on his social media site. He added, “A Special Prosecutor must be appointed. This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! Let the work begin!”

Trump has for years claimed, without evidence, that Democrat Joe Biden only won the 2020 election because of widespread voter fraud.

Evidence presented in courts showed this didn't happen — judges, including some appointed by Trump, rejected nearly every claim of widespread fraud as false or frivolous. 

A special prosecutor in Biden's Justice Department investigated Trump's efforts to undermine the 2020 election, but that probe ended when Trump won back the White House in 2024.

U.S. stocks are drifting higher following the Juneteenth holiday. Treasury yields also edged higher in the bond market after Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the U.S. military will get directly involved in Israel's fighting with Iran. 

World shares are mostly higher and crude oil prices have rebounded — U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 52 cents to $75.66 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard added 31 cents to $77.01 per barrel. Oil prices have been gyrating as fears rise and ebb that war could disrupt the global flow of crude. 

“The stock market's risk premium isn't just rising — it's recalibrating for a world where every macro lever now doubles as a tripwire,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management wrote in a commentary, adding that traders are bracing for what comes next.

Trump's tariffs agenda may have been eclipsed by the conflict in the Middle East, but it remains another major factor weighing on markets, Innes said: “A delayed fuse is still a fuse.”

Trump on Thursday signed an executive order to keep TikTok running in the U.S. for an additional 90 days, giving his administration more time to broker a deal that would bring the social media platform under American ownership.

Trump disclosed the executive order on the Truth Social platform Thursday morning.

The first extension was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban — approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court — took effect. The second was in April when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump's tariff announcement.

It is not clear how many times Trump can — or will — keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far there have been no legal challenges to fight them.

We'll answer a few each day during our live coverage.

When American Masters approached Marlee Matlin about doing a documentary, Matlin had one name in mind to direct: Shoshanna Stern.

Like Matlin, Stern is deaf. She also hadn't directed before. But Matlin, who herself became the first deaf person in the Directors Guild of America just a few years ago, was certain she was up to the task.

The resulting film, “Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore” is an intimate look at her life: Growing up in a hearing family; winning the best actress Oscar at 21 for her first movie role in “Children of a Lesser God,” which film critic Rex Reed at the time called a “pity vote”; what she's described as an abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; getting sober; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.

It's also an evocative portal into the world of the deaf community that uses groundbreaking techniques and sound design to put American Sign Language (ASL) and visual communication first. The film opens in select theaters Friday.

While Matlin told much of her story in the memoir “I'll Scream Later,” on some level it wasn't a completely satisfactory experience. Before the #MeToo movement, its revelations were not treated entirely seriously in the media. But a documentary also provided an opportunity.

“We communicate visually,” she said.

Matlin and Stern spoke though translators to The Associated Press about the “CODA” effect, making the doc on their terms, and why they hope Reed sees this film. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.




STERN: I had never seen a deaf person direct an episode of TV or film. Never. I thought, what does that even look like? I didn't realize until I took the job that really the whole form of documentary as we know it is really rooted in sound, in the assumption that people will be speaking and they can speak. I thought, what are we going to do when we're using American Sign Language? I have to reframe a whole form of documentary. We have to be able to see what a visually-based documentary is going to look like.

We wouldn't do justice to Marlee's life if I had forced this form that really wasn't rooted in the way that she experienced this life. And that was exciting to do. Scary for some people out there, but I never felt scared in making this documentary because she believed in me.

MATLIN: If I had had a hearing director approach me to do this project, we could have done a very good job, but that person would not have seen me in the same way. They would not have the same lens as a deaf person.

STERN: I did want to film with captions in mind, so I made sure that we did have a wider frame. We figured out visual voiceover with a split screen that we added. We did this little surgery with words and syllables in one of the scenes where we mixed them all around to be able to bring people into how Marlee experiences conversations and the world. We wanted to make this documentary an immersive experience for the audience members, a sensory experience to help them understand.

MATLIN: “CODA” certainly was a milestone and respected by so many people in the industry. It tackled a lot of things that both deaf and hearing people or audiences can identify with. I love the fact that they burnt in the captions. That you can't just turn it off.

And I hoped that all the love we received and the three Academy Awards that we got would make a difference. It was honored on so many other levels too as well, whether we're talking about (director) Sian (Heder) or you're talking about Troy (Kotsur) or the SAG award which was just a dream come true, specifically of mine. I took that opportunity to specifically address that that we “exist,” that we want to be actors just like you, we want to be directors, we want be producers, we want to be hair and wardrobe stylists. We want to work in all levels of production. So “CODA” really elevated that conversation about how much we wanted to be part of the industry. But for some reason it didn't really break open the door as wide as I would have thought. Yet we just don't give up. We are persistent. Because it is what it is. We are working on our own levels to make changes.

STERN: Marlee said something really brave when we were at Sundance. She said, “It won't last.” The moment, yes, in the moment. But I don't know if we have movement.

MATLIN: There's so many stories that we can tell, so many stories that you can put up on screen, so many stories that we can put on stage.

I'd like to see action because I've been hearing that, “Yes, we have to do this” or “I will do this,” but it's been 40 years. I don't want to sound like I'm complaining. I just want to make sure that we put our money where our mouth is. 

I go back to that comment about Rex Reed. I wonder if he would ever see this film. I'd love to see if he has the balls to make a comment and say, “Oh look, I realize I might have said something wrong.”

That's just one example of the things I'd like to see happen. And maybe the people who interviewed me over the years. I don't want you to misunderstand me, I have a great deal of respect for them. But specifically, I am calling out Rex Reed. So, you know, sorry but not sorry.

(Reed did not immediately return a request for comment.)

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on two men allegedly torturing an Italian man for access to his Bitcoin account on 'America Reports.'

Just days before Mayor Paul Young of Memphis touted declining crime in the city, a man allegedly stalked and attempted to kidnap him. 

Trenton Abston, 25, was arrested Wednesday and charged with attempted kidnapping, stalking and aggravated criminal trespass against Young, according to the Memphis Police Department (MPD). 

Police said in an announcement on Facebook that public and private security camera footage showed Abston scaling the wall to the mayor's neighborhood and walking to Young's home. He was arrested with a TASER, gloves, rope and duct tape in his vehicle.

Thanks to a rapid response by MPD officers, as well as security camera footage, Abston was quickly apprehended, the department said.

"We understand the concerns raised by this incident and want to reassure the public that the Memphis Police Department remains fully committed to the safety of all residents, including our city's elected officials," the police department said. "We take any potential threat seriously and will continue to act swiftly and thoroughly."

According to Shelby County, Tennessee jail records, Abston remains behind bars as of Friday, and his bond has not yet been assessed. It is unclear whether he has an attorney, and the Shelby County public defender's office could not be reached for comment. 

The suspect was arrested just one day after Young took to X to defend the city after comments made by sports analyst Stephen A. Smith, who said NBA players don't want to play in Memphis due to safety concerns.

"The people in Memphis, it's a great sports town — great fans, great people — but there's an element there where cats like Jimmy Butler and others don't feel like it's the safest environment," Smith said on Tuesday's edition of "First Take" on ESPN. 

"I'm talking to the local authorities in Memphis. You've got to clean some of that stuff up because it's dissuasive to NBA players. They have talked about it. I know. They've told me. That's all I'm saying." 

The comment sparked backlash from Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant and from Young. 

"talkin bout the grizz more than the finals [laughing emoji] wit these [cap emoji] ahh sources," Morant posted on X. "instead of focusing on the performances we seen from jdub/shai, tj/Siakam, how this series is going. We say sumn negative about a city/team on a national level."

Young also weighed in on X. 

"Stephen called us a great sports town - facts," he said. "Best fans in sports? True. People of Memphis? Unmatched."

"But what he is missing is that crime is down significantly in 2024 and 2025. We're not just talking change, we're delivering it. Memphis is rising and we've got the numbers and the heart to prove it."

He also thanked Memphians and Morant for standing up for the city, and invited Smith to come to Memphis, where he is welcome "anytime." 

Young's office and the Shelby County Sheriff's Office did not immediately return comment requests. 

MPD said the security footage was not available for release.

CEO for 'Crowds on Demand' shares insights on spotting funded anti-ICE demonstrators and warns that violent agitators undermine legitimate advocacy efforts

EXCLUSIVE: Vice President JD Vance will travel to Los Angeles on Friday morning to visit the city amid anti-ICE riots, Fox News Digital has learned.

Upon arrival, the vice president is expected to tour a multiagency Federal Joint Operations Center and a Federal Mobile Command Center. There, Vance is expected to meet with leadership and U.S. Marines.

An official familiar with the plans told Fox News Digital that the vice president is expected to deliver brief remarks.

Vance's trip comes in the midst of anti-ICE riots in the city.

Vance is expected to discuss how Los Angeles was destroyed in the midst of the violent protests against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement. He is also expected to discuss how California politicians had a choice and chose to disregard federal laws and turn their backs on law enforcement.

President Donald Trump ordered the National Guard to Los Angeles earlier in June to aid law enforcement amid the violent protests. The Trump administration also sent hundreds of Marines to support law enforcement.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration for taking command of the National Guard, but a unanimous ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Thursday said Trump is allowed to keep control of National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles.

Trump, in a Thursday night post to Truth Social, praised the Court of Appeals for its decision and said the decision was a win.

"BIG WIN in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on the President's core power to call in the National Guard! The Judges obviously realized that Gavin Newscum is incompetent and ill prepared, but this is much bigger than Gavin, because all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done. This is a Great Decision for our Country, and we will continue to protect and defend Law abiding Americans. Congratulations to the Ninth Circuit, America is proud of you tonight!," he posted.

Iran‘s foreign minister said there is “no room” for negotiations with the United States so long as Israeli strikes continue.

Ahead of talks with European officials in Geneva on Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said negotiations with the U.S. would not begin until Israel stopped its strikes. 

“Let me make the position clear. Under the current circumstances, and as the Zionist regime's attacks continue, we are not seeking negotiations with anyone — especially not with the United States — on this matter. It is the Americans who are seeking negotiations; they have sent messages multiple times, including very serious ones. But we have explicitly told them that as long as the aggression and attacks continue, there is simply no room for talk of dialogue or diplomacy,” Araghchi said.

“We are in a legitimate state of self-defense, and this defense cannot and will not stop. We have no discussions with the United States, which we see as a partner in these crimes,” he continued.

The foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany, as well as the European Union's foreign policy chief, will meet with Araghchi in Geneva in an attempt to de-escalate the conflict. 

Araghchi said Iran has “always had dialogue with the Europeans and have discussed various issues with them. Even now, if they have something to say, we are listening. We are not ashamed of defending the rights of the Iranian people, and we are not avoiding anyone.”

ISRAEL LAUNCHES MAJOR ATTACK ON IRAN OVER ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM: WHAT TO KNOW

Israel began striking Iran last Friday and said it was aiming to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In retaliation, Iran has hit Israel with missile and drone strikes, some of which have caused destruction. Iran has said its nuclear program is peaceful.

Iran has said Israeli air strikes have killed 639 people, including top military officials, nuclear scientists, and hundreds of civilians. Israel has said at least two dozen civilians have died from Iranian strikes.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — During his best director acceptance speech at this year's Academy Awards, Sean Baker zealously spoke about the importance of theatergoing, particularly the increasingly threatened independently-owned cinemas. Baker was accepting the award for “Anora,” which won five of the six Oscars it was nominated for that night.

On the other side of that awards campaign, the independent filmmaker is continuing his evangelism for seeing films on the big screen by teaming up with Pluto TV for “Free Movie Weekend,” which highlights independent and family-owned theaters across the country throughout the summer, including the Music Box Theatre in Chicago this weekend. 

The initiative kicked off with Baker's pick near Los Angeles — the Gardena Cinema. Complimentary tickets will also be offered to the Colonial Theatre in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, as well as Detroit's Redford Theater in the coming weeks. 

In an exclusive interview, Baker spoke with The Associated Press about why he feels like a “weird spokesperson” for theatergoing and how he hopes his next film will differ from his previous work. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.




BAKER: I'm Gen X. Growing up, the theaters that we primarily went to were independently owned and usually family owned. Multiplexes kicked in in the late 80s. I love multiplexes. They're great, but there is something that's a little more intimate and has that family warmth. It's not a corporate environment. For a very long time, that's how I discovered and fell in love with the movies. 

And then I actually worked in an independently-owned theater. It was the craziest thing. It was called the Roberts Cinema in New Jersey, and I applied for a job as the ticket ripper. It was a small business, so next thing you know, they are training me on the projectors. Next thing, they're like, “We need a manager.” So, at 17 years old, I was managing, projecting and ticket ripping at a theater in Manville, New Jersey, that's no longer there. They played mostly Disney films during the day and foreign films at night. It was my first real job and I look back fondly on that time.

And then I went to film school and I started making movies. It's always been with the intention of making feature films for theaters. A dream of mine is to someday maybe even own a theater.

BAKER: That's something that I've been personally battling with. I am preaching that this sort of entertainment is meant first and foremost for theaters, so come out and see them. And then at the same time, I make films that are a little bit difficult and not exactly friendly for a wide audience. But I hope that, since my films lean into a little more into that prestige world, maybe people will come out looking for that sort of thing. “This film won the Palme d'Or and then eventually an Academy Award. Maybe this is something we should see in the theater, even though it doesn't fit the mold of what we normally are going to see, which are the blockbuster popcorn movies.” Those are the movies that keep cinemas alive, not my films. Maybe someday. But it's the “Barbies” that are keeping the cinemas alive, not the “Anoras,” even though “Anora” did amazingly well in the hands of Neon. I do sometimes feel like a weird spokesperson for this because I'm not exactly delivering what I'm preaching on. 

BAKER: They do. I mean, those films were nominated. But maybe. Maybe we do need that one extra category for box office success. Why not celebrate that too? I mean that's something that other awards shows around the world celebrate and there's no reason not to celebrate when a film hits the zeitgeist. That's an important cultural milestone. So why not celebrate that publicly? That's what the Oscars are for in many ways.

BAKER: I think the new thing that I'm dealing with is just the pressure of how do I follow up ”Anora?” I don't want to disappoint people, but I want to give something a little new and different. It's just scary. I don't know how else to say it. I just woke up. It's scary. But hopefully I'm working with the same people again, not only making the film, but also distributing the film. And hopefully we make another film that connects.

My favorite filmmakers are filmmakers that do mix it up. They stay in their wheelhouse because that's their voice. But there's always a new thing. And hopefully my new thing is just leaning a little more into comedy. For a long time, I've made films that I would consider to be dramas or tragedies with comedic elements and I kind of want to push it into the comedy with dramatic or tragic elements. That might be my change.

            Aboard Air Force One late Monday night, having hastily left the G7 meeting in Canada, President Donald Trump took questions from reporters about the escalating Israel-Iran conflict. In the back and forth, Trump was asked about Tulsi Gabbard, his director of national intelligence, who testified to Congress in March that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon — a direct contradiction of Israel's claims that Iran was racing toward a bomb.
    


            “I don't care what she said,” Trump replied. “I think they were very close to having it.”
    


            Trump's terse rebuke of his top intelligence official set off a firestorm among the MAGA faithful on right-wing media, long divided over the issue of Iran. It also raised serious questions about Gabbard's standing in the administration.
    


            Just a month ago, White House officials insisted that the president not only liked Gabbard but enjoyed her company.  Even as some in the administration believed that she was out of her depth, officials insisted that Trump and his team were giving Gabbard leeway to learn the ropes of her new job.
    


            But that tone has shifted, as multiple people inside the West Wing have grown disillusioned with Gabbard's performance, sources say.
    


            Though she's been among the most visible voices for the president's national security policy, behind the scenes Gabbard has struggled to carve out her own place in the Trump White House. Recently, Trump has come to see her as “off message” when it comes to the conflict in the Middle East, according to one senior White House adviser.
    


            Trump's annoyance with Gabbard peaked earlier this month, this person said, when she posted a 3-minute video warning that the world is “closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before,” and blaming “political elite and warmongers” for stoking “fear and tensions between nuclear powers.”
    


            Trump viewed the video as a thinly veiled criticism of his consideration to allow Israel to strike Iran, and many inside the White House agreed Gabbard was speaking out of turn, the person added.
    


            “When the president thinks you are off message, he doesn't want you in the room,” the senior White House adviser said. Politico first reported Trump's anger over the video.
    


            On Tuesday, the White House and Gabbard both sought to downplay the moment from Air Force One. Gabbard told reporters that she and the president were on “the same page” on Iran, and the White House rapid response team shared a post on X documenting her comments.
    


            An ODNI official called the president and Gabbard's statements on Iran “congruent,” noting “just because Iran is not building a nuclear weapon right now, doesn't mean they aren't ‘very close' as President Trump said.”
    


            “This is just a lazy regurgitation of a fake news story that BOTH the White House and Vice President have already debunked,” Office of the Director of National Intelligence Press Secretary Olivia Coleman said in a statement. “The Director remains focused on her mission: providing accurate and actionable intelligence to the President, cleaning up the Deep State, and keeping the American people safe, secure, and free.”

            Gabbard is among the newer members of Trump's orbit. A former Democratic congresswoman who forged common cause with the MAGA coalition in part because of its anti-interventionist posture, Gabbard was a frequent critic of Trump during his first term. She attacked him for pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and even accused him of “an act of war” against Iran over his decision to kill a top Iranian general in 2020.
    


            Now, in near-weekly appearances on conservative cable news and in her regular social media feed, Gabbard exudes an image of the perfect MAGA warrior — physically fit, focused on weeding out “deep state” haters and absolutely loyal to Trump.
    


            But in the White House, some Trump officials have begun to question whether she has fully grasped what the job of DNI actually entails, with its oversight of the government's sprawling intelligence community, two administration officials told CNN.
    


            “It's an enormous job,” one administration official told CNN. “She is still very much learning the ropes — and all the various areas that DNI touches.”
    


            Two days before she posted her nuclear war video, Gabbard was absent from a last-minute Camp David gathering of Trump's top national security officials to discuss Israel's plans to attack Iran. Among those present were Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.
    


            Gabbard was on National Guard duty, according to an administration official, who said that the meeting had originally not been slated to address foreign policy. But one person familiar with the session said she wasn't invited because officials didn't feel her presence was required.
    


            Gabbard was back in the White House the Monday after the Camp David meeting, an administration official said. And this week, the White House deliberately moved a meeting to accommodate her schedule, said one official familiar with the episode.
    


            “If they wanted her excluded, that's not what you do,” that person said. An ODNI official said that Gabbard has been at every Situation Room meeting since the conflict between Israel and Iran began last week.
    


            Gabbard maintains allies in the White House, in particular Vice President JD Vance, who issued a statement Tuesday calling her “an essential member” of the team.
    


            When asked if Gabbard was in danger of getting fired, one senior White House official said that the president was hesitant to fire anyone, given the optics.
    


            “He's not interested in firing her at this moment because she's not doing any harm,” the official said. “I think he's questioning her viewpoint as a value, especially after that video.”
    


            Since taking office in February, Gabbard has been fighting to clear a path inside the thorny bureaucracy of the intelligence community. An ODNI official claimed to CNN that Gabbard has identified savings totaling approximately $150 million in contracts, including roughly $20 million by cutting diversity programs and roles.
    


            The job is a tall order for anyone: The DNI has a notoriously fuzzy mandate.
    


            Created after 9/11 to facilitate information sharing and coordination across the now-18 agencies that make up the intelligence community, the office lacks budgetary and operational authority over the CIA and the other agencies it nominally oversees. Past directors have struggled to define its role in the US government, and Trump officials have considered disbanding it entirely in both his first and second terms.
    


            Gabbard has sought to wrest control of the President's Daily Brief from the CIA. The powerful document has long been under the authority of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, but it was produced at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.
    


            Now, Gabbard has directed the document to be put together at ODNI, located a few miles down the beltway from CIA, as part of what an official said was a streamlining effort designed to get vital intelligence in Gabbard's hands faster.
    


            In a job that is explicitly supposed to be apolitical, Gabbard has been overt in her public focus on Trump's political objectives.

            She launched a high-profile effort called the Director's Initiatives Group designed to look into political priorities of the president, including what the administration has deemed the “weaponization” of the US intelligence community under the Biden administration. She's also fired top career officials she accused of leaking and participating in an office chat group devoted to trans support issues.
    


            Gabbard declassified documents about domestic terrorism in an effort to show the Biden administration targeted its political opponents, revoked security clearances for former intelligence officials critical of Trump, and made referrals to the Justice Department for criminal leak investigations.
    


            She also called for former FBI Director James Comey to be jailed after he posted an image of seashells that read “86 47” — a matter of domestic law enforcement, which the ODNI, as a foreign intelligence-focused organization, is not traditionally supposed to be involved in.
    


            Gabbard and her allies say she is working to restore trust in the US intelligence community by purging it of “rot” that she says “runs deep.”
    


            But inside the organization she leads, some career officials say Gabbard appears more focused on the image of leadership than actually leading. Like several others in the Trump administration, Gabbard has embraced an online persona that at times has more in common with a fitness influencer than the nation's spy chief. Her Instagram is punctuated with stylized photos of her working out. In one post in early May, she answered a comment from a follower who wanted to know what workout shoes she was wearing.
    


            There's also the sheer breadth of her media appearances. Gabbard is a regular guest on Fox News. On one occasion in late May, she appeared on the network for nearly half an hour.
    


            Multiple career officials who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity said it's not clear to the rank-and-file what Gabbard is doing day-to-day beyond posting to social media and trying to root out intelligence officials she believes have become “politicized.” Her husband, a videographer named Abraham Williams, has appeared on campus and has been known to film Gabbard for her personal social media, according to two sources familiar with the pattern.
    


            Gabbard has surrounded herself with a small, insulated team that has largely cut senior career officials with experience running the agency out of the loop, sources familiar with the dynamic said. That has created a very small circle of people who have insight into her day-to-day running of the intelligence community.
    


            It's all made Gabbard somewhat of a Rorschach test: to her supporters, she's a MAGA warrior tackling entrenched corruption; to her opponents, she's a naive crusader, warping the ideal of apolitical intelligence in her zeal to support the president.
    


            Democrats say, far from depoliticizing the intelligence community, Gabbard is doing the opposite — wielding the office for Trump's own political advantage. By involving herself so directly in the politics of his administration, Gabbard risks compromising the objectivity and integrity of the intelligence analysis that national security leaders rely on to make decisions.
    


            The top Democrats on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees last week sent a letter to Gabbard demanding information on her decision to fire the top lawyer to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community and place a “senior advisor” in an office that is, under statute, supposed to conduct independent oversight of the intelligence community.
    


            And the firing of the top two officials on the National Intelligence Council — the senior most analytical group in the intelligence community, whose job it is to understand and assess the biggest threats facing the United States — has also drawn fierce scrutiny from Democrats and former intelligence officials.
    


            In April, one of Gabbard's top advisers, Joe Kent, demanded that the NIC “update” an assessment that undercut the president's rationale for invoking the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations — an interference that former intelligence officials and Democratic members of Congress say was a disturbing example of a political leader inappropriately politicizing intelligence conclusions.
    


            “She believes she was hired to do the political aspect of this job,” one source close to Gabbard told CNN.

Emmanuel Acho, LeSean McCoy, James Jones and Chase Daniel discuss whether the Kansas City Chiefs or Philadelphia Eagles are more closer to returning to a Super Bowl. 

The Kansas City Chiefs are being sued by former NFL defensive back Ramzee Robinson, who previously worked as the team's director of player engagement.

Robinson is alleging wrongful termination after accusing the franchise of discriminating against him because he is Black.

He filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri on Sunday.

In the lawsuit, Robinson claims that he was called into a meeting in February and accused of attacking a female co-worker, and that the Chiefs refused to show him security video of the encounter. Robinson ultimately was fired from his position, which involved locker room management, mentorship and other responsibilities within the team.

The lawsuit claims that Robinson was paid a salary of $125,000 by the Chiefs, but that his research found other NFL teams paid comparable positions an average salary of $171,932, not including other benefits. It also claims that "the Chiefs paid African-American business employees less than their white counterparts."

Chiefs spokesman Brad Gee told The Associated Press on Wednesday that while he could not comment on pending legal matters, "to be clear, the Chiefs do not tolerate discrimination of any kind."

Robinson spent nine years working for the Chiefs in a front office role.

Robinson was the final player chosen in the 2007 draft by Detroit. He played in 19 games over two seasons for the Lions, then appeared in three games for Philadelphia and four for Cleveland in 2009. He never played for the Chiefs.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Chiefs for further comment.

Democrats can no longer paper over their party's core contradiction.

Four years ago, America was on the cusp of the largest expansion of its welfare state since the 1960s. 

Under Joe Biden in 2021, House Democrats passed legislation that would have established a monthly child allowance for most families, an expansion of Medicaid's elder care services, federal child care subsidies, universal prekindergarten, and a paid family leave program, among other new social benefits. 

But that bill failed — and then, so did Biden's presidency. 

Now, Republicans are on the brink of enacting the largest cut to public health insurance in American history. And the outlook for future expansions of the safety net looks dimmer than at any time in recent memory.

There are two primary reasons why progressives' prospects for growing the welfare state have darkened.

Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz. 

First (and most straightforwardly), the Democrats are not well-positioned to win full control of the federal government anytime soon. To win a Senate majority in 2026, the party would need to win multiple states that Trump carried by double digits last year. And the 2028 map isn't that much better. The basic problem is that Democrats have built a coalition that's heavily concentrated on the coasts and thus, systematically underrepresented in the Senate. To win the robust congressional majorities typically necessary for enacting large social programs, Democrats would likely need to transform their party's brand. 

Second, although Democrats developed grander ambitions for social spending over the past decade, they simultaneously grew more averse to raising taxes on anyone but the super-rich. In the 2010s, when inflation and interest rates were persistently low, the party could paper over this tension with deficit spending. But Biden-era inflation revealed the limits of this strategy. 

And if Congress passes President Donald Trump's tax cut plan, then interest rates and inflationary risk are likely to remain elevated for years, while the cost of servicing America's debts will soar. Add to this the impending exhaustion of Social Security's trust fund, and space for new welfare programs is likely to be scant, unless Democrats find a way to enact broad-based tax increases.

Liberals could respond to all this by paring back their ambitions for the welfare state, while seeking to advance progressive goals through regulatory policy. It is perhaps not a coincidence that the two most prominent policy movements in Democratic circles today — the anti-monopoly and “abundance” crusades — are both principally concerned with reforms that require no new tax revenue (antitrust enforcement in the former case, zoning liberalization in the latter).

But expanding America's safety net remains a moral imperative. In the long-term, Democrats must therefore strive to build the electoral power and political will necessary for raising taxes on the middle-class (or at least, on its upper reaches).

Over the course of the 2010s, the Democratic leadership's appetite for new social spending grew. Bernie Sanders's insurgent campaigns in 2016 and 2020 put Medicare-for-All at the center of the party's discourse, and moved its consensus on the welfare state sharply leftward. In the latter primary, even the Democrats' most moderate contender — Joe Biden — vowed to establish a public option for health insurance and tuition-free community colleges, among other social programs.

Biden's agenda only grew more ambitious upon taking office. No president since Lyndon B. Johnson had proposed a more sweeping expansion of social welfare than the Build Back Better Act.

And yet, while Democrats' aspirations for social spending had become historically bold, the party's position on taxes had grown exceptionally timid. In 2016, Hillary Clinton had promised not to raise taxes on any American family earning less than $250,000. Four years later, Biden vowed to spare all households earning less than $400,000 – despite the fact that tax rates on upper middle-class families had fallen during Trump's first term. 

Meanwhile, the Democrats' congressional leadership was actually pushing to cut taxes on rich blue state homeowners by increasing the state and local income tax deduction.

In other words: In 2021, Democrats were promising to establish an unprecedentedly large welfare state, while keeping taxes on 98 percent of households historically low. 

Officially, the party believed that it could square this circle by soaking the super-rich. After all, America's highest-earning 1 percent had commandeered more than 20 percent of the nation's annual income. The government could therefore extract a lot of revenue by merely shaking down the upper class.

In reality, though, Biden's vision was also premised on the assumption that America could deficit-finance new spending with little risk of sparking inflation or high interest rates.

The Build Back Better Act did not actually raise taxes on the rich by enough to offset its social spending. Instead, Democrats leaned on budget gimmicks to “pay for” its agenda: Although the party intended the law's new programs to be permanent, it scheduled many of them to expire after just a few years, so as to make the policies look cheaper over a decade-long budget window. Absent these arbitrary expiration dates, the bill would have added $2.8 trillion to the deficit over a decade. Even as written, the law would have increased deficits by $749 billion in its first five years.

More fundamentally, Biden's basic fiscal objective — to establish wide-ranging social benefits through taxes on the super rich alone — only made sense in a world of low inflation. 

Western Europe's robust welfare states are all funded through broad-based taxation. This is partly because administering a large safety net requires managing economic demand. When the government expands its provision of elder care, social housing, child care, and pre-K, it increases overall demand for workers and resources in the economy. And if the supply of labor and materials doesn't rise in line with this new demand, then inflation can ensue. 

Taxes effectively “pay for” new spending by freeing up such resources. When households see their post-tax income decline, they're often forced to make fewer discretionary purchases. Raise taxes on an upper middle-class family and it might need to postpone its dreams of a lake house. That in turn frees up labor for public programs: The fewer construction workers needed to build vacation homes, the more that will be available to build affordable housing. 

But soaking the extremely rich does less to dampen demand than taxing the upper middle-class does. Even if you increase Elon Musk's tax rate by 50 percent, he won't actually need to reduce his consumption at all — the billionaire will still have more money than he can spend in a lifetime. 

The same general principle applies to multimillionaires, albeit to a lesser extent: Raise their taxes, and they're liable to save less money, but won't necessarily consume fewer resources. And if they do not curb their consumption in response to a tax hike, then that tax hike will not actually free up resources.

In 2021, Democrats felt no obligation to sweat these details. For nearly a decade after the Great Recession, economic demand had been too low. Workers and materials had stood idle on the economy's sidelines, as there wasn't enough spending to catalyze their employment. In that context, unfunded welfare benefits can boost growth without generating inflation.

But as Democrats moved Build Back Better through Congress, the macroeconomic terrain shifted beneath their feet. Biden likely would have struggled to get his social agenda through the Senate (where Democrats held only 50 votes) even in the absence of 2022's inflation. But that surge in prices all but guaranteed the legislation's defeat: Suddenly, it became clear that the government could not increase economic demand without pushing up inflation and interest rates. America had returned to a world of fiscal constraints.

Unfortunately, those constraints could prove lasting, especially if Donald Trump's tax agenda makes it into law.

The most lamentable aspect of Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” are its cuts to healthcare and food assistance for the poor. Yet even as it takes health insurance from 10 million Americans and reduces food assistance to low-income families by about $100 a month, the legislation would add $2.4 trillion to the debt over the coming decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 

Yet the actual cost of the GOP's fiscal vision is even larger. To reduce their bill's price tag, Republicans' set some of their tax cuts to arbitrarily expire. Were these tax cuts made permanent, the bill would add roughly $5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.

This is likely to render the US economy more vulnerable to inflation and high interest rates in the future.

Thus, the next Democratic government probably won't have much freedom to deficit spend without increasing Americans' borrowing costs or bills. Meanwhile, if that administration holds power after 2032, it will also need to find a ton of new revenue, just to maintain America's existing welfare state. 

Social Security currently pays out more in benefits than it takes in through payroll taxes. For now, the program's dedicated trust fund fills in the gap. But in 2033, that fund will likely be exhausted, according to government projections. At that point, the government will need to find upward of $414.5 billion in new revenue, each year, to maintain existing Social Security benefits without increasing the deficit. 

Given Democrats' current stance on taxes, the imperative to keep Social Security funded would likely crowd out the rest of the party's social welfare agenda. Indeed, merely sustaining Americans' existing retirement benefits would almost certainly require raising taxes on households earning less than $400,000. Maintaining such benefits while also creating new welfare programs — in a context of structurally high deficits and interest rates — would plausibly entail large, broad-based tax increases, the likes of which today's Democrats scarcely dare to contemplate.

To be sure, it is possible that technological progress could render this entire analysis obsolete. Some analysts expect artificial intelligence to radically increase productivity over the next decade, while devaluing white-collar labor. This could slow the pace of wage and price growth, while turbo-charging income inequality. 

In a world where robots can instantly perform work that presently requires millions of humans, America could plausibly finance a vast social welfare state solely through taxes on capital. 

But until AI actually yields a discernible leap in productivity, I don't think it is safe to take an impending robo-utopia as a given. 

Democrats probably can't escape the tension between their commitments on taxation and social spending. But they can seek to mitigate it in a few different ways.

One is to scale down the party's ambitions for the welfare state, while seeking to advance progressive economic goals through other means.

Such a retreat would be understandable. The party's fear of raising taxes is not baseless. In a 2021 Gallup poll, only 19 percent of Americans said they would like to have more government services in exchange for higher taxes, while 50 percent said they'd prefer lower taxes in exchange for fewer services. 

Meanwhile, Democrats have grown increasingly reliant on the support of upper middle-class voters. In 2024, the highest-earning 5 percent of white voters were more than 10 percentage points more Democratic than America as a whole. The lowest earning two-thirds of whites, by contrast, were more Republican than the nation writ large.

In this political environment, calling for large middle-class tax hikes could well ensure perpetual Republican rule. 

In the short term then, Democrats might therefore be wise to narrow their agenda for social welfare, focusing on modest programs that can be funded exclusively with taxes on the rich. 

At the same time, the party could seek to better working people's lot through regulatory policy. You don't need to raise middle-class taxes to expand collective bargaining rights, guarantee worker representation on corporate boards, or raise the minimum wage. And the same can be said of relaxing regulatory barriers to housing construction and energy infrastructure. (Of course, achieving any of these goals federally would require Democrats to win a robust Senate majority — one sufficiently large and progressive enough to abolish the legislative filibuster, which currently establishes a 60-vote threshold for enacting new, non-budgetary legislation.) 

In the long run though, Democrats must not forfeit the pursuit of a comprehensive welfare state. America lets more of its children suffer poverty — and more of its adults go without health insurance — than similarly rich countries. These deprivations are largely attributable to our nation's comparatively threadbare safety net. And they can only be fully eliminated through redistributive policy. A higher minimum wage will not ensure that children with unemployed parents never go hungry, or that every worker with cancer can afford treatment. 

Furthermore, as technological progress threatens to rapidly disemploy large segments of the public, robust unemployment insurance is as important as ever. And as the population ages, increasing investment in eldercare will be increasingly imperative.

Democrats should seek to make incremental progress on all these fronts as soon as possible. Even if the party is only willing to tax the rich, it can still finance targeted anti-poverty spending. But absent an AI-induced productivity revolution, building a holistic welfare state will require persuading the middle-class to accept higher taxes.

How this can be done is not clear. But part of the solution is surely to demonstrate that Democratic governments can spend taxpayer funds efficiently and effectively. So long as blue areas struggle to build a single public toilet for less than $1.7 million — or a high-speed rail line in less than 17 years — it will be hard to persuade ordinary Americans to forfeit a larger chunk of their paychecks to Uncle Sam. 

All this said, Democrats have plenty of time to debate the future of fiscal policy. In the immediate term, the party's task is plain: to do everything in its power to prevent Trump's cuts to Medicaid and food assistance from becoming law. 

The path to a comprehensive welfare state won't be easy to traverse. Better then not to begin the journey toward it by taking several steps backward.

            The Los Angeles Dodgers and the federal government are at odds over what happened on Thursday when federal agents were on or near Dodger Stadium grounds.
    


            Reports began to circulate that federal agents were present at the stadium outside downtown Los Angeles, sparking concerns that the Trump administration's immigration crackdown was coming to the home of the World Series champions hours before a game against the San Diego Padres. Protesters rushed to the area and began chanting anti-ICE slogans at the federal agents.
    


            The Dodgers then posted on X that ICE had come to the stadium and requested access to the grounds – a request that the team says it denied.
    


            “This morning, ICE agents came to Dodger Stadium and requested permission to access the parking lots. They were denied entry to the grounds by the organization. Tonight's game will be played as scheduled,” the team said in a post on X.



            But not long after that post, the Department of Homeland Security stated that the agents who were at Dodger Stadium were not from ICE and their presence wasn't related to the immigration crackdown that has roiled Los Angeles.
    


            US Customs and Border Protection vehicles were in a nearby parking lot on or near the grounds, and one of them had a car malfunction that caused them to stay longer, according to a CBP official who maintained there were no operations related to the MLB club.
    


            There has been an influx of CBP agents in the Los Angeles area on the heels of the protests against President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement agenda. The Department of Homeland Security surged agency personnel to the region, including border agents, to respond to those protests and many have remained in the area.
    


            “This had nothing to do with the Dodgers. CBP vehicles were in the stadium parking lot very briefly, unrelated to any operation or enforcement,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
    


            Dodger Stadium is in a relatively isolated area located within a major metropolitan population. The stadium is in the Elysian Park neighborhood of Los Angeles and is set back from main roads by winding access drives to the acres of parking lots that surround the stadium. It's unknown exactly what parking lot the federal agents were in when the vehicle had its malfunction – there are huge swaths of parking lots within stadium property and some parking lots outside that are used for overflow and stadium employees when the grounds are filled.
    


            Video shown by affiliate KABC showed federal agents stationed on one of the streets leading up to the stadium. CNN has reached out to ICE for comment.
    


            The intense reaction from the Dodgers, public, and federal government exemplifies the tension gripping the Los Angeles area right now as the administration's immigration crackdown has led to protests against ICE and pressure on the Dodgers to do more to support their fans, of which a large proportion is Latino.
    


            The team lost 5-3 to the San Diego Padres in Los Angeles on Thursday and staged a celebrity softball game, hosted by star player Mookie Betts, in celebration of Black Heritage Night. The Dodgers are averaging more than 50,000 fans in attendance per home game this season, the only team in the majors bringing in that many fans per game. Thursday's home game was an especially hot ticket as the two teams are heated rivals in the National League West Division.
    


            The Dodgers had been expected Thursday to announce a plan to assist the immigrant community impacted by the recent round of immigration operations but that announcement has now been delayed “because of the events earlier today,” Dodgers President Stan Kasten told the Los Angeles Times. 



            The federal agents' action comes days after singer Nezza, whose full name is Vanessa Hernández, performed the US National Anthem in Spanish on Saturday. She said she was first planning on singing the Anthem in Spanglish, but with the ongoing immigration raids, she decided to do the song in Spanish only.
    


            She says a team employee told her not to. That didn't deter her, and she performed the song in Spanish anyway.
    


            Her performance took place the same day that demonstrators filled streets across the country for the “No Kings” protest and as frustrations in Los Angeles continued because of ICE raids that took place within the past few weeks.
    


            While the team hasn't outwardly spoken on the ongoing frustrations of the ongoing immigration crackdowns ICE raids that have been happening in the city, star player Dodgers player Kike Hernández, a native of Puerto Rico, showed his support for Los Angeles in an Instagram post.



            “I am saddened and infuriated by what's happening in our country and our city,” Hernández said in part. “Los Angeles and Dodger fans have welcomed me, supported me and shown me nothing but kindness and love.”
    


            “This is my second home. And I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart,” he said, adding, “ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.”

President Donald Trump wants to give back $9.4 billion in federal spending to Congress that it has already approved. But it's proving to be an uphill battle with Senate Republicans.

Some GOP senators don't want to claw back funds for certain programs, including $1.1 billion to public broadcasting and $900 million in foreign aid for global health, despite a party-wide search for cost-cutting measures across the federal government.

The DOGE-inspired $9.4 billion rescissions legislation that House Republicans passed last week accounts for but a sliver of Trump's $4 trillion “big, beautiful” tax and spending proposal to advance his domestic agenda. But the desire for Congress to sign off on budget cuts that he's made by executive orders is compounding what are already fraught policy negotiations among both GOP-led chambers and the White House.

“We'll all make up our own minds,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) said recently, reflecting on those urging the Senate to rubberstamp the House. “There's a reason why these things are in the law in the first place. It's because we believe that a lot of this stuff is good and it's good public policy, so it's OK for them to suggest that they have a different point of view.”

The rescissions legislation would codify cuts identified by the Elon Musk-created Department of Government Efficiency and aim to deliver on GOP pledges of rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government. The claw back of billions of funds only requires a simple majority in the 53-47 GOP-controlled chamber rather than the Senate's usual 60-vote threshold.

House Republicans only narrowly passed it 214-212. New rescissions can't be added through amendments, but it's likely senators will seek to strike certain items or minimize spending reductions during a marathon amendment process in the lead-up to a final floor vote.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) does not envision the upper chamber addressing the rescissions until the post-July 4 recess and after Congress approves Trump's bill. It will need to pass before the bill hits a July 18 expiration date.

The political posturing is well underway.

White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought will testify next week before the Senate Appropriations Committee about the president's rescissions request. Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) has been tapped by the White House as the Senate point person to help usher it through.

“Passing President Trump's Rescissions Package is a MUST DO,” Schmitt posted Thursday.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) is among the more centrist Republicans with concerns over cutting global health funds. Notably, she'll also lead next week's hearing with Vought as chairwoman of Senate Appropriations.

“I'm not going to get into the specifics,” Collins told the Washington Examiner of her desires to amend the rescissions legislation. “I've made very clear that I do not like the cuts in the global health programs.”

Those include the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, to fight global aids under the all-but-defunct U.S. Agency for International Development. The bill would claw back $400 million of the $6 billion appropriated by Congress this fiscal year for a program credited with saving millions of lives around the world since its inception under former President George W. Bush.

Rounds and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), another centrist, have expressed similar anxieties.

The White House's official justification says the funds would only come from “programs that neither provide life-saving treatment nor support American interests,” adding that the proposal “aligns with the Administration's efforts to eliminate wasteful foreign assistance programs” and “restore focus on health and life spending.”

“This best serves the American taxpayer,” the White House said.

Cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, total $1.1 billion. But it's facing checkered resistance from several members across the ideological spectrum of Senate Republicans, including Collins. Those who represent states with sprawling rural populations, such as Rounds and Murkowski, are particularly concerned about severing constituents from a medium that they say many rely upon for communication and information.

HOUSE SENDS $9.4 BILLION RESCISSIONS PACKAGE TO SENATE AFTER NARROW VICTORY 

Public radio is often the “only communications” for rural Native American reservations, according to Rounds.

“The early warning and the natural disaster warning and the weather warning is the AM-FM systems they've got,” he said. “That's of concern to me.”

Ben Wattenberg died 10 years ago this month, but his legacy still looms large. Wattenberg, a pundit, demographer, and political operative, reshaped Washington and America through his farsighted thinking and writing. He constantly told his once beloved Democrats to stop drifting further and further to the left. They just as steadfastly refused to listen, with the ramifications still being felt today. 

Wattenberg's career was built on the mastery of data. Long before Google, he immersed himself in facts and figures, poring over government reports and academic journals to understand the latest statistics on policy matters. He knew crime rates, birth rates, and welfare trends in an age when there was no internet to provide an answer via a few keyboard strokes. He then used that data to explain, inform, predict, and entertain.

Wattenberg was born in the Bronx in 1933. After graduating from Hobart College and serving in the Air Force, he was working in publishing when he came up with the idea of describing America using data as the narrative device. The resulting book, This USA, written with former head of the Census Bureau Richard Scammon, led to Wattenberg's appointment as a White House speechwriter for President Lyndon Johnson. Wattenberg then became an important player in Democratic politics, working for the presidential campaigns of Vice President Hubert Humphrey in 1968 and Henry “Scoop” Jackson, his personal favorite, in 1972 and 1976. He also wrote many important books, including The Real Majority, which used census data to show that, despite the media emphasis on civil strife of the 1960s, the real majority in America was “middle-class, middle-aged, middle-minded, unyoung, unpoor, and unblack.” According to Wattenberg, the median voter was not a protesting radical but a middle-aged housewife from Dayton, Ohio. This insight reportedly inspired President Richard Nixon's notion of the “Silent Majority” and has remained an important element in American politics to this day. Wattenberg continued to influence presidents, earning the moniker of “Ronald Reagan's favorite Democrat” in the 1980s and receiving a much-discussed, almost hourlong phone call from President Bill Clinton in reaction to Wattenberg's 1996 book, Values Matter Most.

Numbers guided Wattenberg's insights throughout his career. In The Birth Dearth, he argued that contrary to conventional wisdom, underpopulation rather than overpopulation threatened the prosperity and political influence of Western nations. This belief made him an unabashed supporter of legal immigration. In The Good News Is the Bad News Is Wrong, Wattenberg marshaled statistics to make the case for optimism, a corrective that would still be helpful today. He also used his numbers to inform his long-standing syndicated newspaper column and his TV appearances — in particular his show Think Tank, in which 17 seasons of informed panel discussions benefited from the smart rule, “No journalists, no politicians, no kidding.”

Wattenberg called his approach to punditry “data journalism.” To master the numbers, he developed relationships with experts in shops all over town. Years before one could download Excel spreadsheets via websites, Wattenberg learned who had access to the key statistics and who could teach him so that he could explain them in ways the average reader could understand. His Rolodex — yes, he had one — was filled with names like Stephanie Ventura of the National Center for Health Statistics, Carl Haub of the Population Reference Bureau, and Dallas Salisbury of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. These nonfamous but data-deep experts would walk him through their latest reports and help him identify vital trends and revealing developments. 

Wattenberg's immersion in the numbers strengthened his inveterate optimism, patriotism, and deep concerns with the trajectory of the Democratic Party. He used data to bring home America's bright future — and consistently advised that the more optimistic presidential candidate would win elections.  It remains good guidance for those seeking political office.  

Wattenberg's writing had real zest to it. He had a plainspoken way of expressing himself that led his friend and colleague Jeane Kirkpatrick to observe, “Ben writes in ‘American.'” To Wattenberg, this was an enormous compliment, as a love of America infused his writings. In 1991's The First Universal Nation, he wrote, “For five hundred years, America has been the biggest story in the world, page one above the fold.” Wattenberg believed American economic, political, and cultural influence would continue, adding, “That story isn't over.”  

Wattenberg's indefatigable belief in America contributed to his sense of foreboding about the Democrats' leftward drift. He started his career in Washington as an LBJ speechwriter, recalling that Johnson would assign him campaign speeches because, Wattenberg wrote, Johnson knew “I really hated Republicans.” But his hatred of the Republicans softened during decades of laments that the party of his youth had left him behind. Wattenberg had clear and what he saw as obvious advice for the Democrats. In his mind, the Democratic Party should abolish racial quotas rather than establish them, stand up for free speech rather than stifle it, and promote employment rather than push welfare dependency. He praised the union movement for its anti-communist efforts but was frustrated when the movement was captured by government workers whose leadership dragged the Democratic Party even further to the left.

Wattenberg's decades-old observations on the Democrats' leftward drift read like they could be written today. In 1981, during Reagan's first year in office, Wattenberg wrote that “the Democrats must face the music. They are not in trouble because they have no money, organization or unity. Exactly the opposite: They have no money, organization or unity because they are in trouble.” In 1984, shortly after Reagan crushed Walter Mondale to win reelection, Wattenberg was dismissive of the excuses liberal Democrats would use to explain their defeat: “Accidents, tricks, personal popularity. Everything but substance.” 

Wattenberg did not just complain. He tried to offer the Democrats a way out: Democrats “will serve their country and their party better if they acknowledge that their real problem — which is the issues they have come to represent — than they will by trumpeting a phony one, that television did them in. A wrong diagnosis yields a wrong remedy.” He also warned Democrats to avoid what he called “the Reagan trap”: “Reagan said, several million times, that government is not the solution — it's the problem. Many Democrats took the bait. If Reagan said government was so very bad, and Reagan was such a silly fellow, then Democrats must therefore say government is so very good. Trap snaps! Republicans win the White House.” This dynamic sure sounds a lot like how Democrats deal with our current president — and Wattenberg would have liked the alliterative sound of “the Trump trap.”

PENTAGON PROBLEMS: IT'S BEEN A ROUGH A ROUGH ROAD FOR MANY DEFENSE SECRETARIES 

Wattenberg's imprint on our politics extends beyond his writings. Among his many skills, Wattenberg had a keen eye for talent. He mentored people who reflect his approach today, including the pundit Jonah Goldberg, polling expert Karlyn Bowman, New York Times reporter Mark Mazzetti, and former White House domestic policy adviser and author Karl Zinsmeister.  

Wattenberg's talent-spotting was not unlike his trend-spotting: He had an ability to look at a sea of ordinary people, or numbers, and spot the extraordinary within them. For all who knew him personally, he is still missed — and for frustrated Democrats, he remains a voice who foresaw why Democrats are out of power in Washington today.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China sent 74 warplanes toward Taiwan between late Thursday and early Friday, 61 of which crossed the central line in the Taiwan Strait that unofficially divides the sides, an unusually large number as tensions remained heightened in the region. 

It wasn't clear why so many planes were scrambled between late Thursday and early Friday, as tabulated by Taiwan's Defense Ministry. The planes were sent in two separate tranches, it added.

China considers Taiwan its own territory and uses such deployments to advertise its threat to encircle and possibly invade the self-governing island. China also hopes to intimidate Taiwan's population of 23 million and wear down its equipment and the morale of its armed forces. 

On Thursday, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs “confirmed and welcomed” the transit of the British Royal Navy's off-shore patrol craft HMS Spey through the Taiwan Strait a day earlier. The ship's transit, the ministry said, “once again (reaffirmed the Strait's) status as international waters.” 

“Such transits by the U.K. and other like-minded countries are encouraged to safeguard peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the Foreign Ministry said.

Britain's representative office in Taipei said in a statement that the Spey had conducted a navigation of the Taiwan Strait in accordance with international law and rights provided under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

“Wherever the Royal Navy operates, it does so in full compliance with international law and exercises its right to Freedom of Navigation and overflight,” the statement added.




China responded angrily, saying the Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army “organized troops to monitor and guard the entire process and effectively responded and dealt with it.”

The British ship's action “deliberately disturbed the situation and undermined the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,” the Eastern Theater Command said in a statement. 

The bustling Taiwan Strait lies in international waters, but China objects to any transit or activity within it by foreign military vessels.

It wasn't clear if the large number of Chinese warplanes sent on Thursday and Friday were related to the earlier sailing of the British ship. 

Six military ships accompanied the Chinese planes, which ranged from drones to fighter jets and early warning and other support aircraft. Taiwan deployed ships, fighter interceptors and land-based missile systems in response.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — An appeals court on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump to keep control of National Guard troops he deployed to Los Angeles following protests over immigration raids.

The decision halts a ruling from a lower court judge who found Trump acted illegally when he activated the soldiers over opposition from California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

The deployment was the first by a president of a state National Guard without the governor's permission since 1965.

In its decision, a three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded it was likely Trump lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the guard.

It said that while presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's guard, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for doing so, citing violent acts by protesters.

“The undisputed facts demonstrate that before the deployment of the National Guard, protesters ‘pinned down' several federal officers and threw ‘concrete chunks, bottles of liquid, and other objects' at the officers. Protesters also damaged federal buildings and caused the closure of at least one federal building. And a federal van was attacked by protesters who smashed in the van's windows,” the court wrote. “The federal government's interest in preventing incidents like these is significant.”

It also found that even if the federal government failed to notify the governor of California before federalizing the National Guard as required by law, Newsom had no power to veto the president's order.




Trump celebrated the decision on his Truth Social platform, calling it a “BIG WIN.”

He wrote that “all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done.”

Newsom issued a statement that expressed disappointment that the court is allowing Trump to retain control of the Guard. But he also welcomed one aspect of the decision.

“The court rightly rejected Trump's claim that he can do whatever he wants with the National Guard and not have to explain himself to a court,” Newsom said. “The President is not a king and is not above the law. We will press forward with our challenge to President Trump's authoritarian use of U.S. military soldiers against citizens.”

The court case could have wider implications on the president's power to deploy soldiers within the United States after Trump directed immigration officials to prioritize deportations from other Democratic-run cities.

Trump, a Republican, argued that the troops were necessary to restore order. Newsom, a Democrat, said the move inflamed tensions, usurped local authority and wasted resources. The protests have since appeared to be winding down.

Two judges on the appeals panel were appointed by Trump during his first term. During oral arguments Tuesday, all three judges suggested that presidents have wide latitude under the federal law at issue and that courts should be reluctant to step in.

The case started when Newsom sued to block Trump's command, and he won an early victory from U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco.

Breyer found that Trump had overstepped his legal authority, which he said only allows presidents can take control during times of “rebellion or danger of a rebellion.”

“The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of ‘rebellion,'” wrote Breyer, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton and is brother to retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.

The Trump administration, though, argued that courts can't second guess the president's decisions and quickly secured a temporary halt from the appeals court.

The ruling means control of the California National Guard will stay in federal hands as the lawsuit continues to unfold.

            A federal appeals court is allowing President Donald Trump to maintain control over thousands of members of California's National Guard.
    


            The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request from Trump to lift, for now, a lower-court ruling that had required the president to relinquish control of roughly 4,000 guardsmen from the Golden State that he had federalized to beef up security in Los Angeles amid unrest over immigration enforcement.
    


            The court said in an unsigned ruling “that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority” under the federal law he invoked to federalize the guardsmen earlier this month, rejecting arguments pushed by California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom that Trump had violated federal law when he seized control of part of his state's militia.
    


            The panel of judges who issued Thursday's ruling is comprised of two Trump appointees and an appointee of former President Joe Biden.
    


            Last week, US District Judge Charles Breyer directed the president to relinquish control of the guardsmen after concluding that Trump had violated several provisions of the law he leaned on in order to take control of the troops, including one that requires presidents to issue an order “through the governor” when they want to federalize state troops.
    


            The appeals court briefly put Breyer's ruling on hold shortly after it was issued, and Thursday's ruling from the 9th Circuit extends that pause while the legal challenge plays out. California has the option of asking the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis.

            Though the ruling hands a significant loss to Newsom, the appeals court still rebuffed some of the arguments Justice Department lawyers had presented to the judges earlier this week, including that courts lacked authority to second-guess a president's determination that certain requisite factual predicates had been met to justify his decision to invoke the law at issue in the case.
    


            But the court concluded that its “review of that decision must be highly deferential” to the commander in chief.
    


            “Under a highly deferential standard of review, Defendants have presented facts to allow us to conclude that the President had a colorable basis for invoking” the law, the judges said in the ruling, going on to note that some protesters in California had targeted federal property or agents. “Those activities significantly impeded the ability of federal officers to execute the laws,” the court said.
    


            In leaning on the law, 10 USC 12406, Trump pointed in part to one provision of it that said a president can federalize a state's National Guard if they are “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”
    


            The appeals court on Thursday also rejected another key argument California had made in its challenge to Trump's actions: that he violated a procedural aspect of the law that requires presidents to issue an order “through the governor” when they want to federalize state troops. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave the state's top general, not Newsom, Trump's June 7 memo calling up members of the militia.
    


            But since the California general is an “agent” of the governor, the appeals court said, Trump and Hegseth's actions “likely met the procedural requirement.”
    


            The ruling comes as the situation in Los Angeles has calmed significantly since last week, when the legal fracas over Trump's decision to send troops to the streets of America's second-largest city began after a weekend of unrest there.
    


            Shortly after the court's ruling, Trump boasted on his Truth Social platform, calling it a “BIG WIN” and insisting the decision means that “all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done.”
    


            More legal wrangling over how Trump is actually using the guardsmen on the ground in Los Angeles is expected to continue during a hearing Breyer, of the federal court in San Francisco, has set for Friday afternoon.

President Donald Trump lamented the number of holidays in America in a post on Juneteenth evening.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Thursday that Trump would not commemorate Juneteenth, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States, and was established as a federal holiday by former President Joe Biden in 2021.

“Too many non-working holidays in America. It is costing our Country $BILLIONS OF DOLLARS to keep all of these businesses closed,” he posted on Truth Social. “The workers don't want it either! Soon we'll end up having a holiday for every once working day of the year. It must change if we are going to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

“I'm not tracking his signature on a proclamation today,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday of Trump. “I know this is a federal holiday. I want to thank all of you for showing up to work. We are certainly here. We're working 24/7 right now.”

Trump said in 2021 that he made Juneteenth “very famous.”

“I did something good: I made Juneteenth very famous,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal. “It's actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it.”

While the White House did not celebrate Juneteenth, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley did release a statement. “On June 19, 1865, Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, to proclaim the end of slavery, delivering on the promise of President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation,” he wrote. “Juneteenth stands as a defining moment in our nation's history as a celebration of liberty and a declaration of our God-given equality. 160 years later, this day serves as a clear reminder that unity and liberty are at the core of what it means to be American.”

Biden celebrated the holiday in Galveston, Texas, at Reedy Chapel AME Church.

Trump has not said he would end Juneteenth as a holiday, though he has slammed diversity initiatives within the federal government and elsewhere.

WHITE HOUSE LISTS NO JUNETEENTH CELEBRATION PLANS FOR TRUMP

Earlier this year, Trump said he plans to add holidays celebrating the end of World War I and World War II on May 8 and Nov. 11, respectively. He also said then that there are too many holidays.

“We will not be closing the Country for these two very important Holidays, November 11 and May 8, World War I and World War II, because we already have too many Holidays in America,” he wrote. “There are not enough days left in the year. We were Workers then, and we are Workers now!”

Meta approached artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI about a potential takeover bid before ultimately investing $14.3 billion into Scale AI, CNBC confirmed on Friday.

The two companies did not finalize a deal, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because of the confidential nature of the negotiations.

One person familiar with the talks said it was "mutually dissolved," while another person familiar with the matter said Perplexity walked away from a potential deal.

Bloomberg earlier reported the talks between Meta and Perplexity. Perplexity declined to comment. Meta did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Meta's attempt to purchase Perplexity serves as the latest example of Mark Zuckerberg's aggressive push to bolster his company's AI efforts amid fierce competition from OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet. Zuckerberg has grown agitated that rivals like OpenAI appear to be ahead in both underlying AI models and consumer-facing apps, and he is going to extreme lengths to hire top AI talent, as CNBC has previously reported.

Meta now has a 49% stake in Scale after its multibillion-dollar investment, though the social media company will not have any voting power. Scale AI's founder Alexandr Wang, along with a small number of other Scale employees, will join Meta as part of the agreement.

Earlier this year, Meta also tried to acquire Safe Superintelligence, which was reportedly valued at $32 billion in a fundraising round in April, as CNBC reported on Thursday.

Daniel Gross, the CEO of Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman are joining Meta's AI efforts, where they will work on products under Wang. Gross runs a venture capital firm with Friedman called NFDG, their combined initials, and Meta will get a stake in the firm.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on the latest episode of the "Uncapped" podcast, which is hosted by his brother, that Meta had tried to poach OpenAI employees by offering signing bonuses as high as $100 million with even larger annual compensation packages.

"I've heard that Meta thinks of us as their biggest competitor," Altman said on the podcast. "Their current AI efforts have not worked as well as they have hoped and I respect being aggressive and continuing to try new things."

The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a request from two toy companies to expedite their challenge to President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The ruling from the nation's high court means that the Trump administration now has the standard 30-day window to file its response to the challenge.

Two small family-owned companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, argued that Trump lacked authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose his April 2 tariffs.

The companies earlier this week asked the Supreme Court to expedite consideration of their challenge and bypass a federal appeals court.

"In light of the tariffs' massive impact on virtually every business and consumer across the nation, and the unremitting whiplash caused by the unfettered tariffing power the president claims, challenges to the IEEPA tariffs cannot await the normal appellate process," the companies argued in their request.

Rick Woldenberg, the chairman and CEO of Learning Resource and hand2mind, told CNBC that the Friday Supreme Court decision "was a disappointment but honestly just another twist in the road."

"You want to win every motion but sometimes you don't," he said, adding that, "ultimately this showdown will be at the Supreme Court."

Trump declared a national economic emergency under the IEEPA to justify implementing his tariffs without first getting congressional approval, a strategy that has drawn legal challenges from businesses and individuals questioning his authority

The U.S. Court of International Trade last month temporarily blocked Trump's tariffs, saying that the IEEPA, which became law in 1977, does not authorize a president to implement universal duties on imports.

But a federal appeals court earlier this month allowed Trump's tariffs to remain in effect until it hears arguments on that case at the end of next month.

Semiconductor stocks declined Friday following a report that the U.S. is weighing measures that would terminate waivers allowing some chipmakers to send American technology to China.

Commerce Department official Jeffrey Kessler told Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Taiwan Semiconductor this week that he wanted to cancel their waivers, which would allow them to send U.S. chipmaking tech to their factories in China, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF declined about 1%. Nvidia and Qualcomm also fell about 1% each, while Marvell Technology and Taiwan Semiconductor slipped about 2% each.

The latest reported move by the Commerce Department comes as the U.S. and China hold an unsteady truce over tariffs and trade, with chip controls a key sticking point.

The countries agreed to the framework of a second trade agreement in London days ago after relations soured following the initial tariff pause in May.

The U.S. issued several chip export changes after the May pause that rattled relations, with China calling the rules "discriminatory."

U.S. chipmakers have been hit with curbs over the past few years, limiting the ability to sell advanced artificial intelligence chips to China due to national security concerns.

During its earnings report last month, Nvidia said the recent export restriction on its China-bound H20 chips hindered sales by about $8 billion.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call that the $50 billion market in China for AI chips is "effectively closed to U.S. industry." During a CNBC interview in May, he called getting blocked from China's AI market a "tremendous loss."

Tesla has inked its first deal to build a grid-scale battery power plant in China amid a strained trading relationship between Beijing and Washington.

The U.S. company posted on the Chinese social media service Weibo that the project would be the largest of its kind in China when completed.

Utility-scale battery energy storage systems help electricity grids keep supply and demand in balance. They are increasingly needed to bridge the supply-demand mismatch caused by intermittent energy sources such as solar and wind.

Chinese media outlet Yicai first reported that the deal, worth 4 billion yuan ($556 million), had been signed by Tesla, the local government of Shanghai and financing firm China Kangfu International Leasing, according to the Reuters news agency.

Tesla said its battery factory in Shanghai had produced more than 100 Megapacks — the battery designed for utility-scale deployment — in the first quarter of this year. One Megapack can provide up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours.

"The grid-side energy storage power station is a 'smart regulator' for urban electricity, which can flexibly adjust grid resources," Tesla said on Weibo, according to a Google translation.

This would "effectively solve the pressure of urban power supply and ensure the safe, stable and efficient electricity demand of the city," it added. "After completion, this project is expected to become the largest grid-side energy storage project in China."

According to the company's website, each Megapack retails for just under $1 million in the U.S. Pricing for China was unavailable.

The deal is significant for Tesla, as China's CATL and carmaker BYD compete with similar products. The two Chinese companies have made significant inroads in battery development and manufacturing, with the former holding about 40% of the global market share.

CATL was also expected to supply battery cells and packs that are used in Tesla's Megapacks, according to a Reuters news source.

Tesla's deal with a Chinese local authority is also significant as it comes after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on imports from China, straining the geopolitical relationship between the world's two largest economies.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk was also a close ally of President Trump during the initial stages of the trade war, further complicating the business outlook for U.S. automakers in China.

The demand for grid-scale battery installation, however, is significant in China. In May last year, Beijing set a new target to add nearly 5 gigawatts of battery-powered electricity supply by the end of 2025, bringing the total capacity to 40 gigawatts.

Tesla has also been exporting its Megapacks to Europe and Asia from its Shanghai plant to meet global demand.

Capacity for global battery energy storage systems rose 42 gigawatts in 2023, nearly doubling the total increase in capacity observed in the previous year, according to the International Energy Agency.

Millions more Americans should be taking weight-loss drugs to prevent heart disease, according to the American College of Cardiology. 

Exercise and a clean diet aren't always enough for heart health, the nation's top cardiology organization said in new recommendations released on Friday. Weight-loss drugs should be used earlier, making them part of the first line of defense for obese patients, the group said.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Coinbase has secured a license from Luxembourg to offer crypto services across the European Union and will make the country its central hub in the region.

The U.S. crypto exchange's main European base has been in Ireland since 2023.

Coinbase said Friday that it obtained its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) license from Luxembourg's Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF).

MiCA is a sweeping regulation that aims to create a harmonized legal framework for crypto across all 27 EU member states. The rules, which came fully into force late last year, also aim to reduce risks for consumers buying crypto assets following a series of scandals in the sector.

It makes Coinbase the first U.S. crypto exchange to receive a MiCA license. Rival firm Gemini, which is owned by the Winklevoss twins, is expected to receive its own EU license from Malta soon. Gemini chose Malta as its MiCA hub in January.

"Coinbase is all in on Europe, and we're advocating for crypto's future across the continent," Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC. "MiCA has set the standard, and Luxembourg is leading the way with its pro-business climate and thoughtful approach to regulation."

Previously, Coinbase decided on Ireland as its central EU hub in 2023 and launched a big public relations blitz around the move at the time. However, the company ultimately backtracked on this decision, concluding Luxembourg would make more sense for its status as a "forward-thinking financial hub."

"The decision was made less-so due to Ireland, but rather for the reasons that Luxembourg presented a highly compelling option," Daniel Seifert, vice president and regional managing director of EMEA at Coinbase, told CNBC.

Luxembourg has four blockchain-related policies that have been signed into law, whereas Ireland currently lacks any crypto-specific laws.

He added that Coinbase is still investing heavily in Ireland with "imminent" plans to add around 50 jobs to its local Dublin office. Seifert has also personally relocated to the country from the U.K. as CEO of Coinbase's Irish entity.

Globally, Coinbase isn't the first to receive crypto authorization across the EU — but it is one of the largest. Rival exchanges Bybit, OKX and BitGo have all secured their own respective MiCA licenses.

Once a laggard in the online investing game, JPMorgan Chase now believes it is a leader.

The bank on Friday is set to unveil new tools that allow investors to research and purchase bonds and brokered certificates of deposit through its mobile app, CNBC is first to report.

Users can set up customized screens and compare bond yields on the same banking app or web portal that they use to check their account balances, according to JPMorgan executives. The moves are part of a concerted effort to beef up the bank's credentials among investors who trade a few times a month.

"Our goal was to create an experience that makes it extremely simple for clients that want to buy fixed income," said Paul Vienick, head of online investing at JPMorgan's wealth management arm. "We've taken that exact thought process for the simplicity of [buying] stocks and ETFs and moved that into the fixed-income space."

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets and a leader across most major categories of finance, is relatively puny compared with other online brokerages. Despite seeing steady gains in recent years as it added functions including the ability to buy fractional stock shares, the bank has only recently crossed $100 billion in assets under management, CNBC learned.

That pales in comparison to online investing giants including Charles Schwab, Fidelity or E-Trade, which have had decades to accumulate investors and acquire competing platforms.

The bank first attempted to snare more of the trillions of dollars that self-directed investors hold by launching a free trading service in 2018. JPMorgan called it "You Invest" and marketed the new name in a push that included prominent placement at the U.S. Open in tennis.

But by 2021, JPMorgan saw the brand wasn't connecting the way it had hoped and pivoted to simply calling it the Self-Directed Investing platform.

That year, with the business managing about $55 billion in assets, CEO Jamie Dimon called out the firm's product in his usual blunt way.

"We don't even think it's a very good product yet," Dimon told analysts at a financial conference. "So we're driving that thing."

Part of JPMorgan's pivot was to hire Vienick, a veteran of TD Ameritrade, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, in October 2021 to overhaul the bank's efforts.

"There was a recognition that in wealth management, we have some catching up to do overall," Vienick said in a recent interview at the bank's midtown New York headquarters.

That also includes managing more money for wealthy Americans through financial advisors at physical locations, a push that was helped by JPMorgan's 2023 acquisition of First Republic. JPMorgan banks half of the country's 19 million affluent households but has just a 10% share of their investing dollars.

The industry now recognizes that providing good online tools is table stakes, even if the emphasis had previously been on human financial advisors who earn more revenue by providing more services.

Around half of those who use a financial advisor also invest on their own with online tools, Vienick said.

Now, the bank is looking to target more engaged investors, those who research and buy stocks a few times per month and who are more inclined to purchase bonds directly rather than owning them through mutual funds.

It currently offers customers up to $700 for moving funds to its self-directed platform.

Up next, the bank is working on providing users the ability to execute after-hours stock trades, Vienick said.

It's all part of the bank's efforts to convince customers who bank with JPMorgan already or have its credit cards to consolidate more of their wallet with the firm. Doing so will allow an investor to have a single view of their finances and move money instantaneously between accounts, Vienick said.

The bank's advantages — its vast branch network, deep balance sheet and reputation under Dimon — have Vienick confident that JPMorgan will eventually join the other large players among online brokerages.

"I have every belief the self-directed business outside of core wealth management can be a trillion-dollar business," Vienick said. "It's going to take hard work. It's going to mean we're delivering what clients are asking for."

Rude people are, sadly, all around us. We deal with them at work, in stores and restaurants, on airplanes and public transit, even at home. They get in our faces and yell. They blame us for things they've done. They make everything unpleasant.

Luckily, handling rudeness is not hard as you might think. There are several tactics: addressing the rudeness; setting clear boundaries of what you will and won't put up with; shifting the conversation away from the negative; and, probably most important, staying calm and cool.

As language and communication experts, here are the phrases that calmly demand respect and put rude people in their place.

This is a classic redirection tactic. You're centering the conversation on the other person, not you.

Sometimes people just need a little reminder that they're actually acting out about something completely different than the matter at hand. And often, getting the opportunity to reflect upon this or talk about it changes the entire situation.

Similar phrases: 

Addressing someone's rudeness head on is a key component to dealing effectively with incivility. By using this phrase, you're telling the speaker that what they're saying is unacceptable, and that perhaps they need to reassess their words. 

Research studies discovered that reminding someone that they're being rude can make them realize they need to correct their behavior.

Similar phrases:

This is similar to the previous phrase, except you're not saying it straight out — you're implying that you don't like what they just said.

Phrases like this stop the conversation in its tracks and force the speaker to rethink what they're saying, while also making it clear that you won't allow it to continue.

Similar phrases:

This is an example of setting boundaries, a main aspect of coping with rudeness. You're calmly letting the person know you refuse to continue with the current situation, and you're redirecting the negative energy onto a positive path.

Similar phrases:

Saying that you understand what someone is saying in spite of the manner in which they're saying it defuses the situation by acknowledging them.

Often a big cause of rudeness, especially in the workplace, is the fear of not being noticed or paid attention to. The simple "I see your point" gets past that obstacle.

Similar phrases:

Here's another "I acknowledge you" statement, with an added "stay cool." You're inviting the person to continue speaking, but (and this is important) stressing that the conversation can't continue the way it began. It's boundary-setting and defusing at the same time.

Similar phrases:

This very simple request can stop rude behavior or conversation in its tracks. The key, though, is saying it quietly and politely. Matching rudeness with rudeness only escalates things.

Similar phrases:

That's right. Saying nothing at all, and just looking at the other person in silence, can sometimes be the most effective method of shutting down aggressiveness or rudeness. It's difficult for someone to amp up the situation when there's nothing to fight back against. 

Finally, if you feel your anger rising and can tell that you're about to fight fire with fire, it's best to physically remove yourself. This way, instead of escalating the situation, you're giving yourself — and possibly the other person — the time and space to cool down.

Priyanka Jain, co-founder and CEO of vaginal microbiome test and care company Evvy, is very involved in her company's hiring process.

"Nothing is more important than who we hire," she told CNBC Make It at Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies Gala and Summit. "I interview every single person before we hire them." Evvy currently has 25 employees.

Jain also looks at candidate resumes, and there's one section in particular that she believes can indicate some level of success at a startup like hers: the Interests section.

An Interests section could give a sense of your passion and motivation. Listing outside of work activities like nonprofit volunteering shows that you are a person "who goes above and beyond just what your job title tells you to do," said Jain.

And that's critical for a nascent company. Working at a startup "very much requires you to be feet on the ground, rolling up your sleeves, getting things done," she said. A person who's hungry to learn and do more fits right in.  

Career experts agree with this approach, even if you're not looking to work at a startup. "I love former athletes. I love people that do triathlons. I love parents," ex-Google recruiter and current podcaster and advisor Nolan Church previously told Make It. The Interests section helps show off "passion or creativity that makes you unique, that makes you who you are."

If you feel like you don't have enough outside of work accomplishments or activities to include an Interests section, don't despair. Jain can pick up on passion for what you do in other ways, too.

"I think people who are really driven and really curious tend to have some way that that is coming through" in their resume, she said, even if it's just through "a theme in the types of jobs" they do that proves they want to improve in that field.

Make sure to include your accomplishments on the job and when you've had successes in the workplace. For Jain, the point is "people who are generally interested in their lives and interested in the world around them points to a curiosity that I think is really important to succeed at a startup," she said.

Thousands of private government consultants laid off during the Trump administration's cost-cutting crusade are increasingly flooding a shrinking labor market. 

Job postings among seven of the 10 consulting companies singled out by the General Services Administration for contract cuts are down about 27% since 2023, and about 11% from a year ago, according to data scraped from job boards by labor market analytics firm Lightcast.

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that he doesn't expect tariffs to boost inflation significantly so policymakers should be looking to lower interest rates as early as next month.

In a CNBC interview, the central banker said he and his colleagues should move slowly but start to ease as inflation is not posing a major economic threat, which he expects to continue.

"I think we're in the position that we could do this as early as July," Waller said during a "Squawk Box" interview with CNBC's Steve Liesman. "That would be my view, whether the committee would go along with it or not."

The comments come two days after the Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep its key interest rate steady, the fourth straight hold following the last cut in December.

President Donald Trump, who nominated Waller as a governor during his first term in office, has been hectoring the Fed to lower interest rates to reduce borrowing costs on the $36 trillion national debt.

In his remarks, Waller said he thinks the Fed should cut to avoid a potential slowdown in the labor market.

"If you're starting to worry about the downside risk [to the] labor market, move now, don't wait," he said. "Why do we want to wait until we actually see a crash before we start cutting rates? So I'm all in favor of saying maybe we should start thinking about cutting the policy rate at the next meeting, because we don't want to wait till the job market tanks before we start cutting the policy rate."

Stock market futures saw gains after Waller's remarks.

Whether Waller will be able to marshal much support for his position is unclear.

The FOMC, Waller included, voted unanimously to hold at this week's meeting, keeping the benchmark federal funds rate locked in a target range of 4.25%-4.5%.

According to the "dot plot" of individual officials' expectations for interest rates this year, seven of the 19 meeting participants said they see rates holding steady this year, two saw just one cut likely, while the remaining 10 expect two or three reductions. The dispersion reflected a sense of uncertainty around policymakers about where rates should head, though the median outlook pointed to a total of two cuts.

Trump has called for dramatic moves, saying he thinks the benchmark rate should be at least 2 percentage points lower and even suggested it should be 2.5 percentage points below the current level of 4.33%. In remarks Wednesday before the Fed meeting, Trump called Fed Chair Jerome Powell "stupid" for not pushing to cut.

However, Waller said he thinks the committee should move slowly. Powell's term as chair expires in May 2026, and Waller is considered a contender for the job. Trump has said he plans on making his intentions known soon.

"You'd want to start slow and bring them down, just to make sure that there's no big surprises. But start the process. That's the key thing," Waller said. "We've been on pause for six months to wait and see, and so far, the data has been fine. ... I don't think we need to wait much longer, because even if the tariffs come in later, the impacts are still the same. It should be a one-off level effect and not cause persistent inflation."

Other officials have been reluctant to cut as they wait to see what longer-term impact Trump's tariffs have, primarily on inflation but also on the labor market and broader economic growth.

"We've been on pause for six months, thinking that there was going to be a big tariff shock to inflation. We haven't seen it. We follow the data," Waller said. "I've been arguing since a year ago that central banks should be looking through this."

Powell said repeatedly at his post-meeting news conference Wednesday that he believes the Fed can stay in its wait-and-see mode as the labor market continues to hold up. Inflation data of late has shown little pass-through so far as companies burn off inventory accumulated in the run-up to the tariff announcement, and amid concerns that consumer demand is slowing and reducing pricing power.

Futures market pricing indicates virtually no chance of a rate cut at the July 29-30 meeting, with the next move expected to come in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure.

Pavel Durov, the CEO and cofounder of Telegram, has said all of his 100-plus children will get a slice of his billions — eventually.

The boss of the messaging platform told the French outlet Le Point that he's the "official father" of six children from three partners and has more than 100 offspring in 12 countries after donating his sperm.

"I make no difference between my children. There are those who were conceived naturally and those who come from my sperm donations," Durov said.

"They are all my children and will all have the same rights. I don't want them to tear each other apart after my death."

The Russian-born entrepreneur has an estimated net worth of almost $14 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

"I wrote my will very recently," he told Le Point, adding, "I decided that my children would not have access to my fortune until a period of 30 years has elapsed, starting from today."

"I want them to live like normal people, to build themselves up alone, to learn to trust themselves, to be able to create, not to be dependent on a bank account."

Durov explained that he wrote a will despite being only 40 because his work involved risks and he had enemies from within "powerful states."

He set up Telegram in 2013 after previously founding the Russian social media network VK. Telegram has about 1 billion active users globally.

Durov was arrested last year after French authorities accused him of being complicit in allowing criminal activity to occur on Telegram. He again denied all the criminal charges laid against him.

In an interview with Tucker Carlson earlier this month, Durov said he was still unable to travel freely almost a year after being arrested.

Asked about the comparisons with Elon Musk, he told Le Point he was very different from the world's richest person: "Elon runs several companies at once, while I only run one. Elon can be very emotional, while I try to think deeply before acting — but that can also be the source of his strength."

Like Durov, Musk also has several children. In March, the Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis said she'd had her fourth child with the Tesla CEO.

In response to a comment about his youthful appearance, Durov said his exercise routine involved 300 push-ups in a row, followed by 300 squats.

"I don't drink alcohol, coffee, or tea, I don't smoke, and I stay away from sugar," Durov added.

He also enjoys swimming in Finland or Lake Geneva in the middle of winter.

Stellantis is considering a possible sale of its struggling luxury Maserati unit, among other options, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, as the automaker seeks to overhaul its sprawling portfolio of 14 brands. 

Discussions over Maserati's future started before new CEO Antonio Filosa, who starts on Monday, was appointed last month, while Stellantis was steered by Chair John Elkann. The viability of the French-Italian company's 14 brands — which include Chrysler, Peugeot, Jeep and Alfa Romeo — was a priority for Elkann as he interviewed candidates to fill the CEO job.

Like other European carmakers, the world's fourth biggest automaker is facing hefty U.S. import tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and struggling with stiff competition from Chinese rivals.

Stellantis hired consultant McKinsey early in April to advise it on the effects of the U.S. tariffs on Maserati and Alfa Romeo as the two brands prepare future plans. Stellantis affirmed then that it was fully committed to both brands.

However, a possible divestment of Maserati, its only luxury brand, is among the options McKinsey is exploring for Stellantis, the two sources told Reuters, adding the adviser's assessment was still in the early stages. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.

Asked for comment, a Stellantis spokesperson said: "Respectfully, Maserati is not for sale".

McKinsey declined to comment.

Filosa's predecessor Carlos Tavares, who resigned in December after a poor performance in the U.S. market, had refused to consider getting rid of any of the carmaker's brands.

But some investors and analysts say a streamlined portfolio would boost Stellantis' profit margins. Stellantis shares have lost two-thirds of their value since March last year.

Maserati's sales fell by more than half in 2024 to just 11,300 units and the unit posted an adjusted operating loss of 260 million euros ($298 million) last year. The brand currently has no new model launches scheduled as it waits for a new business plan, after its previous one was put on hold by Stellantis last year. Brand head Santo Ficili said earlier this month the plan would be presented soon after Filosa starts the job.

One of the sources said Stellantis has been coming to terms with the fact that it has too many brands, making it difficult for it to properly invest in all of them.

The carmaker needs to "set priorities," the source said.

Stellantis has not specifically mandated McKinsey to find a buyer for Maserati, but the mandate is to consider all options, including a potential sale, the second source said.

All options are on the table, the source said.

Stellantis' board has been divided over plans for Maserati, one source said.

Some board members think Stellantis is not in a position to sustainably re-launch Maserati and suggest selling it is the best option. Others think Maserati still has value and that selling its only luxury brand would be a huge reputational setback for Stellantis.

Chinese automakers, such as Chery, might be among those interested in buying European auto brands, to support their expansion in the region, where they still lack brand recognition among consumers.

This would be similar to SAIC's 2007 purchase of Britain's MG Motor or Geely's acquisition of Sweden's Volvo Cars in 2010.

SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is envisaging setting up a $1 trillion industrial complex in Arizona that will build robots and artificial intelligence, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Son is seeking to team up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for the project, which is aimed at bringing back high-end tech manufacturing to the U.S. and to create a version of China's vast manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, the report said.

SoftBank officials have spoken with U.S. federal and state government officials to discuss possible tax breaks for companies building factories or otherwise investing in the industrial park, including talks with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, the report said.

SoftBank is keen to have TSMC involved in the project, codenamed Project Crystal Land, but it is not clear in what capacity, the report said. It is also unclear whether the Taiwanese company would be interested, it said.

TSMC is already building chipmaking factories in the U.S. with a planned investment of $165 billion.

Son is also sounding out interest among tech companies, including Samsung Electronics, the report said.

The plans are preliminary and feasibility depends on support from the Trump administration and state officials, it said.

A commitment of $1 trillion would be double that of the $500 billion "Stargate" project, which seeks to build out data centre capacity across the U.S., with funding from SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle.

SoftBank and TSMC declined to comment. The White House and U.S. Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The proposed scheme follows a series of big investment announcements SoftBank has made this year.

In March, it announced it would acquire U.S. semiconductor design company Ampere for $6.5 billion and in April, it said it would underwrite up to $40 billion of new investment in OpenAI, of which up to $10 billion would be syndicated to other investors.

This week SoftBank raised $4.8 billion from a sale of shares in T-Mobile.

Billionaire Brad Jacobs' new building-products distributor QXO offered to acquire GMS for about $5 billion in cash and said it will proceed with a hostile takeover if the company's management rejects the proposal.

This is Jacobs's second hostile takeover threat in the building sector this year and part of his plan to turn QXO into a $50 billion revenue building-products distributor within a decade.

Home improvement chain Home Depot has also made an offer for GMS, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Spokespersons for Home Depot and GMS declined to comment on the report.

The Jacobs's offer comes three months after QXO clinched an $11 billion deal to buy Beacon Roofing Supply, ending a prolonged takeover battle for the roofing company and significantly expanding its footprint in the U.S. and Canada.

An acquisition of GMS would expand QXO's market from roofs into house interior materials, including drywall.

QXO's proposal is still technically in the friendly phase, but Jacobs said that if GMS's board did not accept the offer by June 24, QXO was prepared to bypass management.

"If you choose not to engage ... we are prepared to take our offer directly to GMS's shareholders who we're confident will find the offer attractive," Jacobs said in a letter sent to GMS Chief Executive Officer John Turner.

In similar comments made during his takeover offer to Beacon, Jacobs said GMS was poorly managed and could be more profitable to shareholders under his command.

Georgia-based GMS said in a statement on Thursday that it has received an unsolicited proposal from QXO that will be reviewed by its board. It did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

GMS operates a network of more than 300 distribution centers and its product lineup includes wallboard, ceilings, steel framing and gypsum.

Both Beacon and GMS operate primarily in the U.S., with additional presence in Canada.

The U.S. building industry, mostly locally sourced and fairly protected from tariffs, is undergoing consolidation.

QXO said it offered $95.20 per share for all outstanding shares of GMS, a premium of about 17% over the company's closing price on Wednesday.

In the letter, Jacobs disclosed he first approached Turner in June last year, with conversations continuing until at least May 22, when the two CEOs met in New York.

Jacobs added his decision to take the offer public came after GMS's shares rose following market speculation over a potential QXO acquisition. The offer represents a 29% premium over GMS's value on May 22, he said.

On Wednesday, before the offer was made public, shares of GMS hit their highest level in almost five months after the company reported upbeat quarterly results and announced an additional $25 million in annualized cost reductions.

Jacobs said that following the private talks with Turner, he had heard from industry participants that J.P. Morgan and Jefferies bankers had been aggressively trying to find other suitors to buy GMS.

Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting as financial advisers to QXO. And Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is acting as legal counsel.

Jacobs has built an empire of multibillion-dollar companies spanning industries from logistics to waste management and equipment rentals by acquiring companies in industries undergoing consolidation, and spinning some of them off at a higher value.

QXO was a relatively small software company until 2023, when Jacobs invested about $1 billion and renamed and repurposed it.

China's latest shopping festival, which wrapped up Wednesday, pointed to a pickup in consumption, as e-commerce companies reported strong sales of consumer electronics, as well as beauty and pet care products.

The 618 festival is one of the biggest promotional periods of the year in China as Alibaba, JD.com and other major Chinese e-commerce platforms roll out discounts.

This year, the festival's gross merchandise value, a measure of sales over time, surged by 15.2% from last year to an estimated to 855.6 billion yuan ($119 billion), according to retail data provider Syntun.

That points to some recovery in consumption, after Syntun data for last year's 618 festival revealed a year-on-year decline in sales for the first time in eight years. However, as has been the case with other annual shopping events, retailers expanded the promotional period to start May 13, a week earlier than in 2024, before ending June 18.

Still, JD.com said the number of shoppers participating hit a record high, more than doubling year on year between May 30 and June 18 to an unspecified figure. More than 2.2 billion orders were recorded across JD's channels, which include online and offline stores, food delivery and quick commerce, according to the retailer.

Investors were surprised Monday by a better-than-expected 6.4% increase in national retail sales in May from a year ago — the fastest increase since December 2023, according to official data accessed via Wind Information.

Chinese consumers are spending "a lot of money on outerwear. Cosmetics and beauty doing really well," Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, told CNBC on Friday. The company helps foreign brands — such as Vitamix and iS Clinical — sell online in China and other parts of Asia.

His firm estimates that gross merchandise value during 618 grew by around 14.1% from a year ago, pointing to a slightly slower increase than what Syntun reported.

He also pointed to growing numbers of customers outside of China's big, well-known cities, based on the packages he's seen leaving his company's warehouse. 

Beijing's trade-in program to subsidize certain consumer products such as consumer electronics helped boost sales. 

Household appliances emerged champion among the categories, bringing in 110.1 billion yuan in sales, while beauty and skin care products clocked in 43.2 billion yuan in sales, according to Syntun.

Similarly, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall reported strong sales in categories eligible for government subsidies — with initial sales more than tripling from the same period around the Nov. 11 Singles' Day shopping festival, indicating increased consumer interest in the newest batch of subsidies.

Taobao's generative artificial intelligence tools also boosted sales. Its image-to-video feature and an advanced marketing bidding model boosted campaign return on investment by an average of 12%, the company said earlier this month. That echoes how Alibaba and other major Chinese companies reported improved first-quarter consumer sales, bolstered in part by AI-powered marketing tools.

Shoppers are also splurging on their pets. Taobao and Tmall noted a surge in demand for pet care products, as total sales in the first 100 minutes surpassed the total sales from the first four hours of the same period last year.

But despite strong sales, the mid-year e-commerce festival lost some steam toward the end after some Chinese provincial governments ran out of money to keep offering trade-in subsidies, Chinese media Yicai reported Thursday.

"We believe the June 18 promotion this year could have been stronger, had the trade-in subsidy program remained intact," Nomura analysts said in a note Thursday.

The analysts added that of 32 mainland China regions, around a dozen have suspended trade-in programs. State-run news agency Xinhua on Friday refuted claims that regions had canceled the subsidies. 

Xinhua on Friday also reported that Chinese consumers can expect more consumer goods subsidies from the government as early as July.

This year's 618 festival lasted over a month, running from May 13 to June 18. While retail sales have improved in that period, experts warn that the prolonged duration of such festivals could reduce the incentive for consumption.

"If you do have these festivals, and that's becoming more regular feature of these online platforms that these discounts, rebates and special offers, they continue all throughout the year in different guises, then it becomes difficult for the average consumer to keep on participating in them," said Manishi Raychaudhuri, CEO of Emmer Capital Partners, on CNBC's "The China Connection" on Friday.

Instead, the government and companies will have to think of more innovative ways to boost domestic consumption, he added.

Beijing has opted not to hand out cash to consumers, instead focusing on subsidies for specific products and incremental measures to support employment.

Marketplaces are wary of listing counterfeits, but do customers really care?

Mélissa B. checks a pair of Saint Laurent shoes.

Dressed in a white lab coat, Mélissa B. slips on thin cotton gloves and gently places a Zanzibar blue Hermès Birkin bag, its iconic orange box, a cloth dust cover, and various documents on her desk. She steps back to eye the $18,000 purse, hunting for any bulges or bends. She runs her fingertips along the top, then picking up her pocket-size magnifying glass, she leans in to examine a palladium plate on the flap. The logo has evolved over time, but the engraved text has remained sharp and well-defined, with the characters evenly spaced. “This is one of the key Birkin features to check,” she says.

She shifts her gaze to the stitching, checking for consistency and uniformity. The four palladium feet on the bottom of the bag get a check to ensure they're made of the same metal as the rest of the hardware, and that they're hammered, not screwed, in place. Then she homes in on the zipper—ensuring it's one made by Hermès in-house, with its distinctive H-shaped stopper at the end.

Japan has been quietly blazing a trail for supply chain resilience.

Long before China in early April imposed an export ban on several rare earth elements and magnets widely used in the automotive, robotics and defense sectors, Japan became something of a canary in the coal mine for Beijing's mineral dominance.

The East Asian country was thrust into panic mode in 2010 when China implemented an export ban on rare earths that specifically targeted Tokyo following a heated territorial dispute.

The embargo only lasted for around two months, but it was enough to incentivize the world's fourth-largest economy to change its approach to supply chain security.

Alongside stockpiling, recycling and promoting alternative technologies, Japan has since invested heavily into non-China rare-earth projects — notably Australia's Lynas, the world's largest rare earth producer outside of China.

As a result, Japan's overall dependence on Chinese rare earths has dropped to below 60% from more than 90% at the time of the incident, according to data provided by Argus Media.

Jonathan Rowntree — CEO of Niron Magnetics, which produces rare earth-free permanent magnets — said the U.S.-based company was born a decade ago following the world's first rare earth crisis that "had a particularly significant impact on Japan, albeit less so on the rest of the world."

"Because of that, Japan's actually much more prepared this time around than most other countries," Rowntree told CNBC by email.

"They've stockpiled more, invested in Lynas, and secured Western rare earth supply to meet some of that demand through a combination of Lynas, the Australian mines, and their Malaysian processing facility," he added.

Japan reportedly plans to further reduce its reliance on Chinese rare earth imports to below 50% this year. CNBC has reached out to the Japanese government for comment.

China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing nearly 70% of the world's supply of rare earths from mines and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and refining them.

Western officials have repeatedly flagged Beijing's supply chain dominance as a strategic challenge, particularly given that critical mineral demand is expected to grow exponentially, as the clean energy transition picks up pace.

Japan's supply chain transformation is seen as both a template for Western nations — and a stark reminder of just how difficult it is to escape China's critical mineral orbit.

Japan has enjoyed success through Lynas and its international supply chains by not only investing in rare earth mining but also in the facilities needed to process and refine the materials into usable goods, according to Nils Backeberg, founder and director at consultancy Project Blue.

Still, the country has a long way to go to cut its dependency on China in some key areas, Backeberg told CNBC. This is especially true for heavy rare earth elements, which are generally less abundant in the Earth's crust, elevating their value.

"Not a lot of heavy rare earths come out of Lynas, and most of the ones that do actually get sent to China for further refinement," Backeberg said, adding that China's latest export ban underscores Beijing's importance in heavy rare earths.

But Lynas has continued to make progress in this area. Over the past month or so, the company has announced breakthroughs in two heavy rare earths, claiming to have produced them outside China for the first time.

China's latest rare earth export curbs were implemented as part of a response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff increase on Beijing's products.

"When the tariff war started and tariffs were put on China, the first thing that China did was say 'we're going to stop exporting rare earths.' A few weeks later, we couldn't manufacture a car in America or in Europe, so it is a real problem," Eldur Olafsson, CEO of Greenland-focused mining company Amaroq, told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Thursday.

"No country in the Western world wants one country to corner the market," Olafsson said.

Western auto industry groups have been hit particularly hard by the export curbs, with many increasingly concerned about production outages.

The disruption also extended to Japanese automakers. Suzuki Motor suspended production of its popular Swift car model earlier this month, with local media attributing the step to China's rare earth export restrictions. A Suzuki Motor spokesperson did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Meanwhile, Japanese car giant Nissan said it was exploring ways to minimize the impact of China's export controls by working with Japan's government and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.

"We need to continue finding alternatives for the future, keeping flexibility and keeping our options open," Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa told CNBC earlier this month.

Looking ahead, Niron Magnetics's Rowntree said an all-encompassing government and industry approach would be needed to tackle China's mineral dominance, from accelerating permits for domestic mines to investing in new alternatives to provide sufficient magnet supplies.

"Everyone has seen that this supply bottleneck is an issue. We've all known for a long time that this could happen, but now it has actually happened," Rowntree said.

"I think many customers share my view — that this issue is unlikely to disappear and that we need to have alternatives in the West to address it."

Europe's domestic production of rare earths is limited. Just like the U.S., the region heavily relies on imports, particularly from China, although plans are underway to develop domestic resources and processing capabilities.

For instance, Belgian chemical group Solvay, which operates the largest rare earths processing plant outside of China in La Rochelle, France, aims to supply 30% of Europe's processed rare earths demand for permanent magnets by 2030.

Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank, said the U.S. and European Union will need to work together to create a market for non-Chinese rare earths.

"The West is creating a nascent rare earths industry outside of China at a time when prices are low and companies are grappling with profitability," Baskaran told CNBC by email.

Tax credits and subsidies will be "essential" to ensure that non-Chinese projects can build and scale up, Baskaran said, noting that rare earths go into nearly every modern industry.

Eutelsat shares popped on Friday morning, after the European satellite operator announced a 1.35-billion-euro ($1.55 billion) capital raise led by the French state and backed by other investors.

The company's stock ended the trading day up 31%.

The company said that, along with a debt refinancing plan, the capital increase would support its investment in its existing Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, which are focused on business-to-business and business-to-government operations.

The French state will become Eutelsat's biggest shareholder following the move, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights, followed by India's Bharti Space Limited at 18.7%.

Eutelsat sends its satellites to space using rockets from the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX, deploying them into both LEO and into geostationary orbit (GEO). Following a deal to combine its operations with British satellite firm OneWeb in 2023, Eutelsat became the world's third largest satellite operator in terms of revenues.

On Wednesday, Eutelsat announced a 10-year deal with the French armed forces to provide priority-access space resources on its OneWeb LEO satellite constellation.

The French firm's shares have been hugely volatile this year, experiencing an enormous spike in March on expectations that it could be a European alternative to Elon Musk's Starlink, and subsequently dropping sharply. Shares are currently up 69% year to date.

"As the only European operator with a fully operational LEO network, Eutelsat is positioned to play a strategic role in supporting critical sectors such as military communications, cyber-resilience, and secure government connectivity, fully aligned with European Union and NATO objectives for strategic autonomy," it said in the release.

Other investors, including the U.K., "could join the capital raise in due course," it added.

Writing on X, French President Emmanuel Macron said that by strengthening Eutelsat's position France was "ensuring its strategic independence and paving the way for Europe's" and noted he would discuss the decision at the Paris Air Show on Friday.

Earlier this year, the firm was rumoured to be in the running to replace Starlink in the embattled Ukraine. For years, Starlink has offered Ukraine's military its satellite internet services to assist with the war effort amid Russia's ongoing invasion.

However, relations between the U.S. and Ukraine soured following the election of President Donald Trump — and reports surfaced that U.S. negotiators had raised the possibility of cutting Ukraine's access to Starlink.

Since then, tensions have cooled somewhat between the U.S. and Ukraine and Starlink retains its presence in the war-torn country.

 The SEC likely views cryptocurrencies Litecoin, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano and others as “commodities.” 

The likelihood of US regulators approving a wave of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is now a near certainty, signaling a continued pro-crypto shift at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to Bloomberg analysts Erich Balchunas and James Seyffart.

In a social media post on Friday, Seffart said he and Balchunas have raised their odds for the vast majority of crypto ETF approvals to “90% or higher,” citing “very positive” engagement from the SEC.

The analysts also suggested that the SEC “likely” views cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) as commodities — a designation that would place them outside of its immediate jurisdiction.

Seyffart noted that the timing of approvals and the launch of spot products remains unclear. He speculated the process could take several months and may extend beyond October.

Asset managers are seeking to replicate the success of the spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs, which saw demand far exceed expectations in the first year, culminating in the most successful US ETF launch of all time. 

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which trades under the ticker IBIT, has been the most successful product. In June, it surpassed $70 billion in assets after recording 31 straight days of inflows. As Balchunas noted, IBIT reached that milestone in just 341 days. 

However, Bitcoin's success may be difficult to replicate, given the lukewarm demand for Ether (ETH) ETFs since they launched last July.

Although ETF inflows have improved in recent months, Glassnode reported that by May, the average ETH ETF investor remained “substantially underwater.”

While demand for other crypto assets could eventually outpace Ether, altcoins are unlikely to erode Bitcoin's dominance in the ETF market anytime soon.

Nevertheless, investors are keeping a close eye on several proposals, such as Franklin Templeton's XRP and SOL ETFs, which were recently opened for public comments by the SEC.

What started as a positive day for crypto markets quickly reversed during the U.S. session with bitcoin BTC$103,483.45 sliding below $103,000 from the $106,500 level just hours earlier.

At press time, bitcoin had pared some of the losses, returning to $103,200, down 1.2% over the past 24 hours.

Other large cryptocurrencies endured steeper declines. Ethereum's ether ETH$2,423.65 saw a sharp 4.5% drop in just 90 minutes to as low as $2,372, with trading volume spiking to nearly 800,000 ETH, nearly eight times the average hourly volume, per CoinDesk data. Solana's SOL SOL$139.87, dogecoin DOGE$0.16315 and Cardano's ADA ADA$0.57962 were 3%-5% lower over the same period.

The volatility burst caught many traders off-guard, liquidating about $450 million in derivatives trading positions on centralized exchanges across all digital assets, CoinGlass data shows. Some $387 million of liquidations were tied to long positions that bet on profiting from rising prices.

While macro risks abound — among them the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran — there was no immediate external reason for the sudden price swing. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indexes only inched lower during the day.

Zooming out, BTC continues to trade within a sideways range between $100,000 and $110,000, consolidating just below its all-time record level.

"The mixed view of whether BTC will go above $110,000 again or drop into the $90,000 area doesn't surprise me at all and underscores the overall indecision people and markets feel," said James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet.

"The present BTC stalemate reflects a market caught between bullish long-term sentiment and short-term macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty," he added.

 The commission evaluated more than 10 blockchains, including Ethereum, Avalanche, Sui, Stellar and Polygon. 

The Wyoming Stable Token Commission has shortlisted Aptos and Sei for its stablecoin pilot program, giving Aptos the highest score among the more than 10 blockchains considered for its forthcoming WYST project.

Aptos disclosed Friday that it received the highest marks based on the commission's network testing, scoring 32 points. Solana received an identical score of 32 points, though it was not selected for the pilot phase.

Sei, meanwhile, scored 30 points, ahead of Avalanche (27), Ethereum (26), Base (25) and Algorand (21), among others.

The network tests evaluated metrics such as transactions per second, fees and transaction finality, as reported by X user Phillip, who is associated with the Sei project.

WYST is Wyoming's state-backed stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar and developed in collaboration with LayerZero. News of its development emerged in 2023, several months after the Wyoming Stable Token Act was passed.

Wyoming is launching a stablecoin to generate state revenue by earning interest on reserves held in short-duration US Treasury bonds. The initiative also aims to promote financial innovation and enhance transparency.

In March, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon teased that the new stablecoin could launch by July.

Wyoming embraced digital assets and stablecoins, specifically, long before it became fashionable to do so. Following the election of US President Donald Trump, the US government has carved out a pro-crypto strategy, seeking to enact market structure and stablecoin legislation.

Stablecoin legislation took a major step forward as the Senate passed the GENIUS Act in a 68–30 vote on Tuesday, clearing another hurdle on its path to becoming law.

“Once the GENIUS Act is law, businesses of all sizes, and Americans across the country will be able to settle payments nearly instantaneously rather than waiting for days or sometimes even weeks,” said Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty, who sponsored the legislation.

America's stablecoin push has caught the attention of Fortune 500 companies, whose leaders are increasingly viewing these dollar-pegged assets as a viable business opportunity.

A recent Coinbase survey, which polled 100 executives from the Fortune 500, found that roughly 29% are either using or exploring the utility of stablecoins, up from just 8% in 2024.

 Bitcoin's sell-off is accelerating, and most altcoins are following BTC's path. Will traders buy the dips? 

Key points:

Bitcoin remains stuck in a range, with traders' expectations divided about the direction of the next significant move.

Several major altcoins are showing weakness, suggesting that a wider trend reversal could be at play.

Bitcoin's (BTC) volatility increased on Friday, but the price remains stuck inside the large $100,000 to $111,980 range. Market participants are divided on Bitcoin's next breakout. In a poll, crypto analyst Matthew Hyland asked whether Bitcoin would go to $94,000 or $114,000 and the results were nearly split evenly.

The social media comments on Bitcoin are also divided equally. According to crypto research platform Santiment, for every bearish comment on Bitcoin, there were just 1.03 bullish comments. The firm's social media analysis found that Bitcoin's sentiment from retail was the most bearish since the initial tariff reaction on April 6. 

Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan said in a report that the retail fear was a promising sign as markets “historically move in the opposite direction of retail's expectations.”

Institutional investor confidence also remains strong as the US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have recorded eight consecutive days of inflows per Farside Investors' data. 

What are the vital support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and the altcoins? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin rebounded off the 50-day simple moving average ($104,634) on Friday and rose above the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,590). However, the bulls could not sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.

The bears will try to seize control by sustaining the price below the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to aggressively defend the $100,000 level because failing to do so may start a deeper correction toward $93,000.

On the upside, the bulls will have to maintain the price above the 20-day EMA to signal strength. The pair could then climb to the downtrend line. Sellers are expected to pose a solid challenge between the downtrend line and the all-time high of $111,980.

Ether (ETH) is getting squeezed between the 20-day EMA ($2,551) and the 50-day SMA ($2,466), indicating uncertainty between the buyers and sellers.

The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, the ETH/USDT pair could rise to $2,738 and later to $2,879.

Conversely, a break below the 50-day SMA opens the doors for a fall to the vital support at $2,323. Buyers are expected to defend the level with all their might because a break below $2,323 could sink the pair to $2,111.

Buyers are trying to push XRP (XRP) above the 20-day SMA ($2.20), but the bears have held their ground.

The 20-day EMA has started to turn down gradually, and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating a slight advantage for the bears. The pair could drop to the $2 level, which is a crucial support to keep an eye on. If the $2 level cracks, the XRP/USDT pair could tumble to $1.61.

On the contrary, if the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off $2 and breaks above the 50-day SMA ($2.27), it signals the pair may extend its stay inside the range for some more time.

BNB (BNB) is getting squeezed between the 20-day EMA ($652) and the horizontal support at $634, suggesting an imminent breakout in the near term.

If the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it signals that the BNB/USDT pair may remain inside the $634 to $693 range for a few more days. The trend will turn in favor of the bulls on a close above $693.

Contrarily, a break and close below the $634 support indicates the range-bound action has resolved in favor of the bears. That could intensify selling, pulling the pair to the solid support at $580.

Buyers have kept Solana (SOL) above the $140 support but are struggling to clear the hurdle at the 20-day EMA ($152).

A tight consolidation near the $140 support heightens the risk of a breakdown. If that happens, the SOL/USDT pair will complete a head-and-shoulders pattern. The pair may fall to $123 and subsequently to $110.

Instead, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it signals that the bulls are trying to keep the pair inside the $140 to $185 range for some more time. Buyers will be back in the driver's seat on a close above $185.

Buyers have maintained Dogecoin (DOGE) above the $0.16 level, but the failure to start a strong bounce increases the risk of a breakdown.

If the $0.16 level cracks, the DOGE/USDT pair could descend to the critical support at $0.14. A solid bounce off the $0.14 level suggests aggressive buying by the bulls. A break above the 20-day EMA could keep the pair stuck inside the $0.14 to $0.26 range for a while longer.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price continues lower and breaks below $0.14, it signals that the bears have overpowered the bulls. That opens the doors for a fall to $0.10.

Cardano (ADA) has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the $0.60 level.

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.65) and the RSI near the oversold zone signal an advantage to sellers. If the price remains below $0.60, the ADA/USDT pair could plunge to the crucial support at $0.50. Buyers are expected to fiercely protect the $0.50 support because the failure to do so may sink the pair to $0.40.

The first sign of strength will be a break above the 20-day EMA, suggesting solid buying at lower levels. The pair may then climb to the downtrend line.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) turned down and broke below the 20-day EMA ($37.61) on Thursday, suggesting profit-booking by the short-term bulls.

The bears will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price to the 50-day SMA ($31.81). Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the 50-day SMA. If the price turns up from the 50-day SMA, the relief rally could face selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the HYPE/USDT pair could plunge to $28.50.

Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA to regain control. That suggests solid demand at lower levels. The bulls will then try to push the pair to $42.50.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned up from the $462 level on Thursday and reached the stiff overhead resistance of $500.

Sellers will attempt to defend the $500 level, but if buyers do not give up much ground, the possibility of a break above the overhead resistance increases. If that happens, the BCH/USDT pair could reach $550.

Sellers will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($442) to weaken the bullish momentum. The pair may then slide to the 50-day SMA ($414), which is a crucial support to watch out for.

Sui (SUI) has been trading below the $2.86 support since Tuesday, signaling that the bears have kept up the pressure.

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($3.10) and the RSI in the negative territory indicate an advantage to sellers. If the price dips below $2.68, the SUI/USDT pair could plunge to $2.50 and thereafter to $2. 

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA. Such a move suggests the markets have rejected the breakdown below $2.86. The pair may then climb to the 50-day SMA ($3.46).

Peter Schiff, vocal proponent of gold and a longtime critic of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin BTC$103,486.88, said he intends to launch his own gold-backed token while taking a dig at the value of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins.

“I get bitcoin, but not U.S. dollar stablecoins,” Schiff posted Friday on X. “If you're going to introduce a third-party custodian, why settle for a token backed by a flawed fiat currency like the dollar, when you can own one backed by gold?"

In a reply to a user who encouraged him to launch a gold-backed stablecoin, Schiff confirmed: "They already exist. But I do intent [sic] to launch my own."

His remarks come as the U.S. Senate passed the so-called GENIUS Act to regulate the rapidly growing stablecoin sector, a type of digital currency with prices anchored to an external asset such as fiat currencies. The stablecoin market mushroomed to over $260 billion, with Citi forecasting that it could become a $3.7 trillion asset class by the end of the decade.

These tokens have become a key piece of trading infrastructure and are increasingly popular for cross-border payments and remittances. The market is dominated by U.S. dollar-backed tokens like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. 

Gold-backed tokens, meanwhile, make up a niche but growing segment with a market size of around $2 billion. Contrary to fiat-backed stablecoins, gold tokens are mostly used as a store of value, like their physical version, but on blockchain rails. However, there are ongoing efforts to bring more utility for gold tokens in decentralized finance applications, for example using as collateral for loans.

When Joe Lubin led a $425 million investment to launch the largest corporate Ether treasury company, the comparisons to Michael Saylor were immediate. 

Even Vitalik Buterin quipped that Lubin had become the “Mr. Saylor of ETH” at an industry event in Berlin this month. 

At first glance, the similarities are clear. An obscure company begins ploughing millions into a cryptocurrency, boosting the token's price along with the company's shares. 

But a closer look shows that amassing Ether on a listed firm's balance sheet is actually quite different from the approach Saylor pioneered at MicroStrategy, now dubbed Strategy. 

If Bitcoin was designed to be digital money, then Ethereum was invented to be an ecosystem for decentralised financial apps and ventures. 

“We'll do all the different things to raise money through equity sales and debt that Saylor's brilliantly pioneered,” Lubin, the CEO of Consensys, told DL News in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. 

“We can also do so much more,” he said. 

At the top of the list is staking.

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum relies on a proof of stake consensus model to validate and confirm various transactions on the blockchain. To become a so-called validator on the Ethereum network, users need to stake 32 Ether. 

Validators earn rewards, or yield, for accurately confirming transactions. If they behave maliciously or dishonestly, such as validating fraudulent transactions, the network takes a small portion of the 32 Ether staked as a fine. 

Now SharpLink Gaming, the company Consensys picked to be an Ether vehicle, is entering the staking arena in a big way. 

As of June 13, SharpLink, an online sports betting company, has deposited more than 95% of its $463 million stash back into Ethereum to validate transactions. 

The move is generating an average staking yield of 3%, which means SharpLink is raking in roughly $14 million on an annualised basis. 

And the company, and by extension its stockholders, also benefit from any appreciation in the value of Ether.

‘They would learn quantum physics if they thought they could make reliable money on it.'

Ethereum's staking model also benefits from the high price of Ether. 

The lower the value, the cheaper it would be for someone to buy and control a majority of the network's validators and begin approving fraudulent transactions on the network.

“The economic security of the network depends on the token being scarce,” Lubin told DL News. “It's really good for the platform to lock up a giant amount of Ether.”

Lubin also says he has plans to turn SharpLink's stock, which goes by the ticker SBET, into an onchain token, launch prediction markets, and potentially integrate Consensys' crypto wallet MetaMask throughout. 

The SharpLink manoeuvre has vaulted Lubin back into a precinct of the financial world he left long ago — Wall Street. 

The Ethereum co-founder used to be a partner in the private wealth unit at Goldman Sachs, the white shoe investment bank.

As SharpLink's new chairman, Lubin is now obliged to preside over quarterly earnings calls and engage with analysts and investors. He is keenly aware of the byways of the traditional capital markets. 

As such, he is fascinated by how sophisticated investors will respond to his new Ethereum flywheel at SharpLink. 

“Wall Street cares about one thing. They care about making money,” Lubin said. “They would learn quantum physics if they thought they could make reliable money on it.”

He hopes analysts will pore over his treasury strategy.

And the timing couldn't be more critical. 

Just as Bitcoin and Solana soared to all-time highs in the first quarter, Ethereum lagged far behind. 

“Bitcoin ended up doing very well, partially because Saylor did a great job,” Lubin said. 

“Solana did what they needed to do to get some attention, and that was all the meme coins. And Ethereum was kind of squeezed between.”

In fact, if you had bought Ethereum this time last year and held, you would be down 27% on your investment.

In April, the sluggish price performance turned many in the industry against the blockchain's leadership. 

Some DeFi users blamed the Ethereum Foundation, the network's non-profit steward, for a development roadmap that didn't accrue enough value to the blockchain. They demanded change.

Instead, they got Lubin and a dozen other crypto investment firms, including Arrington Capital and Galaxy Digital, to buy up more than 69,000 shares in SharpLink and turn the online sports betting company into the second-largest holder of Ether after the Ethereum Foundation.

“It took an external shock from how Bitcoin was doing compared to Ether, and how Solana was doing compared to Ether, to wake up,” said Lubin. 

SBET soared 2,700% in just four days following the announcement, raising similar bullish expectations for Ethereum. 

But on June 12, the company said investors involved in the Ether treasury deal may sell their shares. This prompted a major plunge in the stock. 

Lubin said Consensys was not planning on selling its stake but the damage was done — SharpLink's gains have evaporated.

In any event, Lubin appeared comfortable playing the role of Ethereum's evangelist at DappCon in Berlin this week. 

Back in 2014, he collaborated with Buterin, Gavin Wood, and other co-founders to develop the DeFi talisman.

But with the SharpLink play, he hopes to captivate a new audience. 

Alongside pitching SBET analysts on Ethereum applications and DeFi on earnings calls, Lubin expects mainstream news networks will come calling soon, too. 

But that's where the comparison to the Strategy chairman ends. 

When I asked Lubin whether he wants to be the Michael Saylor of Ethereum, he pushed back. 

“I'll be the Joe Lubin of Ethereum.”

Recently gone public stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) was started with a buy rating and $235 price target at Seaport Securities.

The stablecoin market cap could reach $2 trillion in coming years versus just about $260 billion today, said the Wall Street research firm. Alongside, Seaport sees Circle as able to generate annual revenue growth of 25%-30% with gross margins of roughly 40%.

Circle, said the firm, should perform far better than most fintechs over the next two years and thus deserves a premium multiple.

Shares of CRCL are higher by another 19% on Friday to $237, already topping that $235 price target. The stock has now risen nearly eight-fold since coming public at $31 a bit more than two weeks ago.

Ethereum is approaching a critical test as price action tightens, setting the stage for a decisive move above key demand. After weeks of volatile yet controlled trading, bulls are attempting to reclaim higher ground, but momentum remains limited. At the same time, bears have repeatedly failed to drive ETH below the $2,400 level, reinforcing it as a strong support zone for now. With global markets under pressure from geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty, Ethereum's next move could define the direction of the broader altcoin market.

Top analyst M-log1 believes the ETH/BTC pair is the most important chart to monitor in the coming days. According to his view, a breakout—either to the upside or downside—will determine the fate of altcoins across the board. The setup has reached an inflection point after multiple tests of the lower support band, with bulls continuing to defend it against breakdown attempts.

This consolidation phase, combined with suppressed volatility and rising macro tension, makes Ethereum's current structure one of the most significant technical formations in crypto right now. All eyes are now on ETH/BTC as traders prepare for what could be a defining moment in the altcoin cycle.

Ethereum Builds Pressure As Breakout Nears

Ethereum continues to trade within a narrow range that began in early May, hovering between the $2,400 and $2,800 levels. This prolonged consolidation comes at a time of growing geopolitical instability, as the conflict in the Middle East escalates and macroeconomic uncertainty grips global markets. While many investors had anticipated an altseason by now, that rotation of capital into altcoins has yet to materialize. All eyes remain on Ethereum to serve as the catalyst for that next leg higher.

M-log1 believes the ETH/BTC pair holds the most important signal in the coming days. “This is probably the most important chart you want to keep an eye on,” he stated, highlighting that whichever direction ETH/BTC breaks could determine the fate of the altcoin market.

The chart has repeatedly tested the lower support range, with bulls successfully defending that level on at least eight occasions. According to M-log1, this persistent defense suggests that bears are losing momentum, and a breakout to the upside is more likely. “I am 80/20 in favor of the upside,” he said, citing the market's inability to break lower as a sign of underlying strength.

ETH Tests Weekly Moving Averages

Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,550, maintaining its position above all major weekly moving averages—50, 100, and 200. This level marks a key technical pivot as price consolidates between $2,450 and $2,680 after a strong recovery from its April low near $1,500. Despite multiple attempts to break higher, ETH continues to face resistance just below the $2,700 mark, showing that sellers remain active near historical supply zones.

Importantly, the recent weekly candles have held the 100-week and 200-week simple moving averages as support. This indicates structural strength, especially considering the broader macro uncertainty driven by Middle East tensions and tighter U.S. monetary policy. Volume remains steady, with no signs of panic selling, further supporting the idea that ETH is stabilizing.

The current compression in price around key moving averages typically precedes a larger directional move. A confirmed weekly close above $2,700 could open the door to a rapid push toward the psychological $3,000 level. Conversely, losing the $2,400 support would likely trigger a short-term correction back toward the 50-week SMA near $2,289.

Oops, something went wrong

LONDON, June 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Vector Smart Chain (VSC), a Layer 1 blockchain protocol, has announced two strategic developments: the implementation of a fixed $4 gas fee model and the appointment of Peter Ritchie, former Chief Financial Officer at CitiGroup Finance, as Strategic Finance Executive Consultant. These initiatives mark a shift in VSC's operational and leadership structure, aiming to support network scalability and financial oversight.

These developments signal VSC's growing influence at the intersection of blockchain innovation and institutional-grade finance.

Breaking the Mold: VSC Introduces Fixed $4 Gas Fee

In a space dominated by volatile transaction fees and scalability challenges, VSC's flat-rate $4 gas fee provides predictable costs, greater accessibility, and enhanced user confidence.

"The $4 gas fee isn't arbitrary—it's carefully designed to balance network security and accessibility," said a VSC spokesperson. "We're removing the guesswork from blockchain."

VSC's hybrid consensus mechanism ensures high throughput and near-instant transaction finality, making it ideal for enterprise adoption and real-world applications such as asset tokenization.

Backed by this innovation, major platforms are already moving. Notably, BESC Exchange recently announced its migration from Solana to VSC.

"We believe VSC's infrastructure and economics offer the highest upside," said Brian, Executive at BESC LLC.

Strategic Leadership: Peter Ritchie Joins VSC

To support its rapid growth and sustainability-focused vision, VSC has welcomed Peter Ritchie—former CFO of CitiGroup Finance—to help drive global financial strategy.

Ritchie brings decades of institutional finance experience and will play a pivotal role in:

Designing blockchain-based sustainable finance frameworks

Advancing VSC's carbon initiatives

Guiding enterprise and institutional integration

"This isn't just about blockchain—it's about building a transparent, resilient financial future," Ritchie said. "VSC is uniquely positioned to lead that evolution."

Next-Gen Blockchain with Real-World Utility

With transparent network operations via VSC Explorer, deflationary tokenomics (including a $1 buy-and-burn per transaction), and a mission to bring blockchain to mainstream finance, VSC continues to build a robust, accessible, and sustainable ecosystem.

About Vector Smart Chain

Vector Smart Chain (VSC) is a Layer 1 blockchain protocol designed to deliver cost predictability, transparency, and institutional-grade performance. Its fixed $4 gas fee and hybrid consensus mechanism power next-generation decentralized applications, real-world asset tokenization, and carbon market integrations.

MicroStrategy MSTR, doing business as “Strategy,” and MARA Holdings MARA are two well-known Bitcoin-focused stocks. While Strategy is the world's largest Bitcoin treasury company, holding 592,100 Bitcoins as of June 15, 2025, MARA Holdings is a pure-play Bitcoin miner.

Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has been soaring due to increasing acceptance as a non-sovereign asset, as well as higher institutional and corporate adoption. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,695 in May, apparently benefiting from easing trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which reflected the digital currency's growing recognition as a store of value. 

The liberal policies of U.S. President Donald Trump have been benefiting Bitcoin and other crypto assets. An executive order by President Trump, which directed a working group to study and propose changes to cryptocurrency regulations, bodes well for crypto enthusiasts. In March, President Trump announced the creation of a crypto reserve, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano, which augurs well for cryptocurrency-focused stocks, including Strategy and MARA Holdings.

However, the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, as well as the increasing chances of U.S. involvement, has aggravated volatility. Bitcoin stooped to $103,00 but recovered to trade above $106,000, lower than the all-time high, much higher than the $76,000 it registered in early April. Moreover, macroeconomic challenges, including higher tariffs, are concerning for both stocks. In the past week, MSTR and MARA shares have dropped 2.8% and 8.4%, respectively. Year to date, while MSTR shares have appreciated 27.4%, MARA has fallen 13.6%.

MSTR & MARA Stocks' Performances



Strategy or MARA Holdings, which has an edge now?

The Case for MSTR Stock

Strategy benefits from increasing bitcoin yield, 13.7% as of April 28, 2025, keeping the company on track to reach the full-year target of 15%, which is now raised to 25%, and the bitcoin dollar gain target to $15 billion (up from the initial target of $10 billion). Bitcoin gains in dollar terms were $4.1 billion in the first quarter of 2025 and $5.8 billion as of April 28, 2025.

The company's disciplined approach to capital raising through preferred equity offerings — Strike (8% convertible preferred is trading with an effective yield of roughly 9%) and Strife (10% fixed coupon perpetual preferred) — is a key catalyst. As of April 28, 2025, MSTR raised $6.6 billion through equity offerings and $3.4 billion through fixed income ($2 billion from convertible notes, and $0.7 billion each through Strike and Strife).

Strategy has issued $20.9 billion in equities and $6.4 billion in fixed-income securities as part of its 21/21 plan since Oct. 30, 2024. The company has $14.6 million remaining under fixed-income securities and $0.1 million under equities as part of the existing plan. Strategy currently plans to raise $42 billion through equity issuance and $42 billion through fixed-income securities by the end of 2027. Under the current plan, the company has $21.1 billion in equity and $35.6 billion in fixed-income securities remaining to be issued. 

Strategy is benefiting from growing software subscription revenues. The company benefits from continuing cloud demand with its flagship Strategy One, which powers some of the largest analytics deployments in the world. Strategy One supports varied industries, including retail, banking, technology, manufacturing, insurance, consulting, healthcare, telecommunications and the public sector. MicroStrategy is leveraging generative AI to automate and accelerate the deployment of AI-enabled applications across enterprises.

The Case for MARA Stock

MARA Holdings hold 47,531 bitcoins at the end of the first quarter of 2025. The company continues with its commitment to scaling operations and enhancing efficiencies. In 2024, Marathon acquired seven sites across the United States. In the third quarter of 2024, the company increased its interconnect-approved capacity by 372 MW across three Ohio data centers, positioning itself for sustained mining expansion. MARA also acquired the Hopedale and Hannibal facilities for just $270,000 per MW, significantly below the industry average of $900,000 to $1.5 million per MW.

MARA Holdings is developing a greenfield facility in Ohio, which is expected to add 150 MW of capacity. These strategic expansions support MARA's growth and reduce reliance on third-party providers. By owning and operating more than 50% of its 1.7 GW compute capacity, the company aims to minimize operational risks and lower costs. This vertical integration aligns with MARA's objective to lead the digital asset industry while maintaining flexibility in energy sourcing and operational strategy.

However, Bitcoin miners are facing difficulties from rising hashrate hurting margins. Per Coindesk, which cited TheMinerMag report, mining difficulty hit a record 126.98 trillion, propelled by a 14-day average hashrate of 913.54 exahashes per second (EH/s). Intensifying competition and energy costs are expected to drive production expenses above $70,000 per Bitcoin from $64,000 in the first quarter of 2025. This does not bode well for miners, including MARA Holdings' which reported energy costs per Bitcoin of $35,728 in first-quarter 2025.

MSTR's Earnings Estimate Revisions Steady, MARA's Improves

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSTR's 2025 loss is pegged at $15.73 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The company reported a loss of $6.72 per share in 2024.

MicroStrategy Incorporated Price and Consensus

The consensus mark for MARA Holdings' 2025 loss has improved a couple of cents to $1.77 per share over the past 30 days. The company reported earnings of $1.72 per share in 2024.

Valuation: MARA is Cheaper Than MSTR

Both Strategy and MARA Holdings are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of F. 

In terms of Price/Book, Strategy shares are trading at 3.05X, higher than MARA Holdings' 1.37X.

MSTR & MARA's Valuation

 

 

Conclusion

Both Strategy and MARA Holdings benefit from their policy to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. However, MARA's significant dependence on Bitcoin makes it a riskier stock due to growing volatility. Strategy's diversified business model (though software is a very small part of the business) offers some relief to investors in this respect.

Strategy, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, has an edge compared with MARA Holdings, which currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance.

Happy Friday everyone, it's finance editor Jeff Roberts pinch-hitting for Allie. Since I moved to Southern California two years ago, I've been struck by the region's thriving venture capital scene—one that seems to fly under the media radar compared to Silicon Valley and New York. I recently spoke to a longtime veteran of the scene, Adam Winnick.

Winnick is a lively guy and has that all-important VC quality of being able to convene influential people. I first encountered him last month at a dinner for members of the Medici Network, a crypto-focused institutional investor conference, that brought together everyone from startup founders to bankers to representatives of Ivy League endowments and sovereign wealth funds.





The dinner took place at Avra in Beverly Hills. Having attended more than a few of these things, one thing I noticed—aside from the excellent Mediterranean food—was just how normal it felt. There was a time when everyone at a crypto event saw themselves as an outsider, and the VC industry viewed crypto venture capitalists as a different breed playing a different game.





I'm not sure that's the case anymore. Crypto investing now feels like just another stream in venture capital, though some obvious differences remain—especially when it comes to getting paid. Unlike the traditional model where VCs obtain a bushel of shares from a startup, and then wait seven years, the crypto VC world is more liquid and revolves around tokens not stock. (If you want a closer look, check out this deep dive on the topic by Leo).





In the early days, the mix of crypto and venture capital resulted in some pretty egregious behavior—think VCs filling their bags with tokens tied to half-baked projects, and then dumping them onto retail investors. Lately, though, the adoption of stricter lock-up periods has curbed some of the worst abuses, and the expected arrival of clear regulations should improve things further.




For his part, Winnick is a big advocate for the token model. “It's a powerful incentive mechanism to bootstrap network effects. Just because people misuse them today or didn't know what to do with them early on doesn't mean they're not going to be used in the future,” he observes.





Tokens are likely to become a more common feature of the VC landscape if, as Winnick predicts, the worlds of traditional tech and crypto move closer together. If this convergence is indeed taking place, Winnick says the winners will be those who can figure out how to combine the mature tech stack and broad business networks of so-called Web2 with the highly technical and less capital intensive dynamics of Web3. 





Winnick, a former banker, and his cofounder Kamel Mokeddem, a former Oracle exec, appear to be cracking the code on crypto investing. The IRR for the inaugural $45 million fund at their firm Finality Partners was 69% at the end of last year, and boasts Series A investments in promising crypto staking projects like Eigen Layer and Babylon. Meanwhile, though it's early days, the fund's second vehicle Liquid Fund is up 12% this year at a time when many other funds are posting flat or negative returns for the first part of 2025.





While Finality Partners is dwarfed by the giants of the crypto VC world like a16z and Haun Ventures, the traction its partners have gained suggest they've found a lane of their own—an achievement Winnick attributes to his willingness to give blunt advice and be directly accessible to the firm's portfolio companies.





As always, Term Sheet is curious to hear your thoughts. Do you think the worlds of crypto and traditional VCs are coming closer together? And finally, in reading up for this column, I came across a New York business reporter who described the L.A. venture capital scene as more “passive aggressive.” Fair?




See you Monday,

Ethereum has been struggling to break out of its recent consolidation range, with price movements staying within $2,681 and $2,476. Despite attempts at escaping this range, ETH has returned to this zone, leaving investors uncertain.

However, there is growing optimism within the market as Ethereum continues to see substantial investor interest. This support from the growing number of new wallet holders hints at a potential breakout in the near future.

The number of new wallets on the Ethereum network has been rising sharply, signaling strong investor confidence. Since mid-May, the number of new wallets created each week has jumped from 800,000 to 1 million. 

This figure is significantly higher than the 560,000 to 670,000 new wallets observed during the same period last year. The growth indicates a high level of investor interest, with many believing that Ethereum will generate profits in the near term.

Ethereum's macro momentum is also showing positive signs. The recent surge in whale activity is a particularly noteworthy development. Addresses holding between 1,000 to 10,000 ETH have seen a sharp increase in their holdings, rising to 14.3 million ETH, or about 18.6% of the total circulating supply. 

The increasing concentration of ETH in the hands of whales reflects their confidence in Ethereum's long-term potential. This is often seen as a precursor to price recovery, as whales tend to hold significant influence over price movement.

Ethereum is currently trading at $2,564 and remains stuck within a consolidation range between $2,681 and $2,476. Despite recent volatility, ETH has been unable to break free from this price zone. Until it can secure a move above $2,681, the price is likely to remain within this tight range, with sharp movements in either direction quickly reversing.

However, based on the growth in network activity and whale accumulation, Ethereum may be poised for a breakout. A successful breach of the $2,606 resistance, followed by a move past $2,681, would signal that the consolidation phase is coming to an end. If these levels are confirmed, Ethereum's price could rise to new highs.

On the other hand, if broader market conditions fail to match the optimism of investors, Ethereum may continue to consolidate within the current range. A drop below the $2,476 support would signal a bearish turn, potentially sending ETH lower. This could challenge the bullish outlook for Ethereum and delay the anticipated breakout.

New legislation that updates key aspects of data protection law has received royal assent.

The Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUAA) makes a number of changes to the law, including: clarifying how personal information can be used for research; lifting restrictions on some automated decision making; setting out how to use some cookies without consent; allowing charities to send people electronic mail marketing without consent in certain circumstances; requiring organisations to have a data protection complaints procedure and introducing a new lawful basis of recognised legitimate interests.

The Act provides the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) with new powers, including the ability to compel witnesses to attend interviews, request technical reports, and issue fines of up to £17.5 million or four per cent of global turnover under PECR. 

John Edwards, Information Commissioner, said: “The Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 gives organisations using personal information new and better opportunities to innovate and grow in the UK, and further enhances our ability to balance innovation and economic growth with strong protections for people's rights.

“We've published a catalogue of resources to help explain what this new legislation means for businesses. Over the coming months we will launch new guidance, open consultations, and provide practical tools to help embed the Act's principles into everyday operations. Our goal is to ensure that data can be used confidently and responsibly to deliver better services, drive economic growth, and uphold public trust.”

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) changed the way people think about money, giving anyone with a wallet the chance to lend, borrow, or earn yield without needing a bank. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), on the other hand, started out as digital art and collectibles. But the line between these two is blurring fast.

A new wave of hybrid financial products is emerging, pulling together the utility of DeFi with the uniqueness of NFTs. These on-chain assets are no longer just speculative toys or collectibles. They're becoming tools for building entirely new types of value.

So, why is this happening now, and what does it mean for users, investors, and the wider financial system?

DeFi is about automating financial functions using smart contracts. Lending, borrowing, trading, and earning interest can all be done on-chain, without the need for a middleman.

Users can:

The transparency and composability of these services make DeFi extremely flexible. But up until now, most of it has been centered around fungible tokens, currencies that are identical and interchangeable.

That's where NFTs shake things up.

NFTs introduced scarcity and uniqueness to blockchain assets. Each token can carry its own identity, metadata, and utility. In gaming, this meant items and skins. In art, it meant ownership and royalties. But financial applications? That's newer territory.

NFTs are being used to:

By wrapping DeFi positions inside NFTs, developers are turning financial contracts into tradable, portable assets. Imagine your loan position, staking history, or liquidity share represented as a unique digital object you can sell, trade, or transfer. That's where the real innovation is starting.

The term “Financial NFT” is being used more often to describe these new types of on-chain instruments. They bundle traditional DeFi mechanics with the flexibility and uniqueness of NFTs.

Let's break down a few real-world examples:

These models are already live across various DeFi protocols, and more are emerging.

Bringing together DeFi and NFTs is not just a novelty. It's solving real-world frictions that exist in traditional finance, as well as in earlier versions of decentralized systems.

In traditional finance, selling a bond or loan contract might involve paperwork and counterparty risks. In DeFi, when these are wrapped as NFTs, you can instantly sell them on-chain with full transparency.

NFTs let users hold unique financial assets tailored to their needs. This personalization isn't possible with standard fungible tokens.

Financial NFTs offer cleaner interfaces. Instead of managing multiple positions across different platforms, everything can be wrapped and managed as a single, portable NFT.

These hybrid assets are composable. A single NFT might interact with several protocols, earning yield in one while acting as collateral in another.

This shift has also opened new paths for traders and everyday users. For example, those already active on a cryptocurrency trading platform can now explore alternative asset classes with real financial utility. It's expanding the very idea of what “trading” means in a decentralized world.

The current trend of wrapping DeFi functionality into NFT form isn't just about experimenting with the tech. It's about building financial products that behave in more flexible, modular ways.

This opens up a range of new uses:

There's a logic behind it. Financial products need to be adaptable. Traditional markets move slow, rely on outdated infrastructure, and are often closed systems. DeFi and NFTs break that model apart.

And that's attractive to more than just crypto users. Developers are creating financial instruments that can adapt on the fly, integrate with other services, and evolve as market conditions change.

This hybridization didn't happen overnight. A few key shifts helped push it forward:

Add to this the rising awareness of digital identity, privacy, and composability, and it's clear this space is just getting started.

NFTs aren't just collectibles, and DeFi isn't just for coders. When they merge, the result is a smarter, more dynamic form of finance.

As the tools become more polished and the risks better understood, we're likely to see these hybrid assets integrated into everything from trading platforms to everyday payment systems.

Keep an eye on this space. It's a signal that on-chain finance is evolving into something far more useful, flexible, and user-driven than anything we've seen before.

Are NFTs in DeFi riskier than standard tokens?

They carry different risks. While smart contract bugs are always a concern in DeFi, NFTs can also be more illiquid depending on how niche the asset is. However, wrapping positions as NFTs doesn't inherently make them more dangerous. It depends on how they're implemented.

Can I use NFTs to improve my yield strategy?

Yes. Some platforms now allow yield positions to be minted as NFTs, giving you the option to trade or stake them elsewhere. This increases flexibility and may lead to higher returns if managed wisely.

Do I need to understand both DeFi and NFTs to benefit?

It helps. But many platforms are simplifying the process. As the space matures, expect better user experiences where the underlying technology is invisible to the user.

Is this only relevant to crypto-native users?

Not anymore. These hybrid models are drawing interest from more traditional traders and investors who are used to having a CFD trading account and want exposure to digital asset innovation without losing the structure they're used to.

 Bitcoin hater Brad Sherman accused US President Donald Trump of accepting a $300 million bribe from TikTok, but TikTok denied it has anything to do with it. 

Chinese social media platform TikTok denied allegations that it has made purchases of US President Donald Trump's official memecoin.

The official TikTok Policy account took to X on Thursday to deny claims that its owners are buying the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin, responding to accusations by California Democratic Party Representative Brad Sherman.

Sherman had claimed that the “Chinese owners of TikTok have announced they are buying ‘Trump Coins' for $300 million.”

“Congressman, claiming that the owners of TikTok are buying ‘Trump Coins' is patently false and irresponsible and doesn't even accurately reflect a letter you signed last month,” TikTok Policy said in response to the claims.

Sherman's remarks came amid the news that Trump had signed another executive order to delay the ban or sale of TikTok.

The latest delay marked the third postponement, giving TikTok another 90 days to find a buyer or be banned in the US, according to online reports.

Sherman emphasized that US laws allow only one extension, arguing that Trump's failure to enforce the ban against TikTok is illegal.

Sherman's allegations apparently referred to reports about TikTok-connected GD Culture Group announcing plans to buy $300 million of Trump memecoin and Bitcoin (BTC) in May.

While having no known formal ties to TikTok or its parent firm, ByteDance, Nasdaq-listed GD Culture produces artificial intelligence-enhanced content on TikTok as one of its main operations.

“Trump creates ‘Trump Coins' at no cost, meaning this is just a $300 million bribe that goes right into his pocket,” Sherman alleged.

Some online commentators were skeptical of TikTok's denial, but many refuted Sherman's allegations, labeling them as untrustworthy.

Others also expressed doubts about being able to create a cryptocurrency at no cost.

“No one wants TikTok banned, except the Israeli lobby, aka your puppet masters. Why don't you put up a poll asking your constituents if they want TikTok banned,” another commentator stated.

Aside from criticizing Trump over his TikTok policy, Sherman has long been known for his anti-crypto positions, calling for a blanket ban on crypto in 2019.

Sherman's hostile stance on crypto is primarily centered around cryptocurrencies' potential to displace the US dollar.

The Trump administration has taken an opposite approach on crypto, pledging to promote US dollar-pegged stablecoins as part of the US strategy to strengthen the US dollar's sovereignty.

In a striking move, Bitcoin price has started pumping today, with it surging past the $106K mark and eyeing new weekly highs in a potentially continued rally ahead of the last trading session of this week in the U.S. stock markets. 

As per TradingView data, Bitcoin is currently trading at $106,420—up 1.53% in the past 24 hours. It has a 24-hour trading volume of 38.96%, slightly lower than average. 

Following Bitcoin, leading altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP have also caught an upward momentum, both the alts looking to break above key resistance levels. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading near $2,560—up 1.48% in the past 24 hours, while XRP is struggling to surge past its daily high of $2.176. 

The crypto market's sudden upward surge today appears to be driven by a confluence of factors. One of the factors is heightened optimism surrounding regulatory clarity in the U.S., like the passage of the stablecoin bill. Moreover, Donald Trump's recent remarks on Jerome Powell about his view on rate cuts could also be a reason for this strong push. 

The market is currently experiencing renewed bullish momentum heading into the week's final trading session. Moreover, macroeconomic cues, including a recovering U.S. stock market and the anticipated establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as ordered by President Trump, are further fueling the rally ahead of the weekend. It is also coupled with increased Bitcoin demand from corporate treasuries.

Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $2,500 in the early Asian session on Friday despite a surge in new address growth over the past month. The development follows progress in digital assets regulations after the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) bill passed the Senate.

The number of new ETH addresses created in a week has increased in the past month, rising by almost one-third from around the same period last year, according to data from Santiment.

"The amount of new weekly ETH addresses created is ranging around 800K-1M per week, compared to about one-third less at this point last year," wrote Santiment analysts in an X post on Wednesday.

The growth in addresses follows positive developments surrounding the Ethereum ecosystem over the past month, particularly with the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, passing the Senate with strong bipartisan support.

President Donald Trump urged House Republicans to act "LIGHTNING FAST" in advancing the Senate-approved GENIUS bill to his desk. He noted that lawmakers should pass the bill "ASAP," with no further delays or adjustments.

"This is American brilliance at its best, and we are going to show the world how to WIN with digital assets like never before," Trump said in a post on social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday. 

The Senate passed the GENIUS bill on Tuesday in a 68-30 vote, pushing the stablecoin legislation closer to the finish line. House Republicans are expected to consider the legislation soon, with expectations among market participants that the bill will pass before the August recess. If passed, the GENIUS bill will be the first crypto-related legislature to become law in the United States.

Most companies and banks are already looking to leverage stablecoins in their business operations, with notable examples including Apple, Amazon, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley, which are exploring stablecoin solutions.

Debates among lawmakers regarding the crypto market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, which aims to establish a broader regulatory framework for digital assets, have also contributed to rising interest in Ethereum, which hosts the majority of crypto market activity outside of Bitcoin transactions. According to DefiLlama's data, the stablecoin market cap on the Ethereum Layer 1 is above $126 billion, marking a steady increase over the past weeks and a 50.2% dominance over other blockchains.

"This is going to start playing, turning blockchains into infrastructure. And once blockchains become infrastructure that the whole world's powered on, financial infrastructure and a variety of other applications — social, logistics, supply chain, etc. — then ETH becomes like the internet," said Ethrealize co-founder Vivek Raman in an exclusive interview with FXStreet.

"ETH has underperformed for a long time mostly because we have been under regulatory purgatory. Now that all that is lifting, there's going to be a repricing at some point from 'tech play,' which is very limiting to store of value, global infrastructure like oil," he added.

Ethereum futures experienced $16.59 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours, with long and short liquidations totaling $7.77 million and $8.82 million, respectively, according to Coinglass data.

With the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) proving difficult to overcome, ETH continued holding the $2,450 support at the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement. The level is strengthened by the convergence of the 50-day SMA and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) just above the lower boundary of a key channel.

As volume continues to decline, ETH has to hold the lower boundary of the key channel to prevent a strong breakdown. If it holds this level and sustains a move above its 200-day SMA, it could retest the channel's upper boundary resistance. However, a breakdown below the lower boundary could send ETH toward the $2,260-$2,110 range, which is strengthened by the 100-day SMA.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) are moving sideways below their neutral levels, indicating a slightly dominant bearish momentum.

Researchers can now observe the phonon dynamics and wave propagation in self-assembly of nanomaterials with unusual properties that rarely exist in nature. This advance will enable researchers to incorporate desired mechanical properties into reconfigurable, solution-processible metamaterials, which have wide-ranging applications -- from shock absorption to devices that guide acoustic and optical energy in high-powered computer applications.

Phonons are natural phenomena that can be thought of as discrete packets of energy waves that move through the building blocks of materials, whether they are atoms, particles or 3D-printed hinges, causing them to vibrate and transfer energy. This is a quantum mechanical description of common properties observed in various contexts, including the transfer of heat, the flow of sound and even seismic waves formed by earthquakes.

Some materials, both artificial and natural, are designed to move phonons along specific paths, imparting specific mechanical attributes. Two real-life examples of this include materials used in structures to resist seismic waves during earthquakes and the evolution of the rugged yet lightweight skeletons of deep-sea sponges, which enable them to withstand the extreme pressures of deep-water environments.

"Using the liquid-phase electron microscopy technique developed in our lab at Illinois, the new study marks the first time we've been able to observe phonon dynamics in nanoparticle self-assemblies, acting as a new type of mechanical metamaterials," said Qian Chen, a professor of material science and engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

"This opens a new research area where nanoscale building blocks -- along with their intrinsic optical, electromagnetic, and chemical properties -- can be incorporated into mechanical metamaterials," Mao said, "Enabling emerging technologies in multiple fields from robotics and mechanical engineering to information technology."

"This work also demonstrates the potential of machine learning to advance the study of complex particle systems, making it possible to observe their self-assembly pathways governed by complex dynamics," Pan said. "It opens new avenues for data-driven inverse design of reconfigurable colloidal metamaterials using machine learning and artificial intelligence."

The Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, the Defense Established Programto Stimulate Competitive Research and the Army Research Office supported this research.

Chen also is affiliated with the Materials Research Laboratory, chemistry, chemical and biomolecular engineering, the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology and the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the U. of I.

Magnetism and oxygen may intrinsically influence each other, but experts aren't sure why.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

If you list all of the things that had to go right to make life on Earth possible, our minuscule existence (cosmically speaking) seems all the more amazing. Our Sun is a G-type star with moderate radiation output that doesn't tidally lock our planet. The Earth is situated in our Sun's habitable zone. The planet has maintained a robust atmosphere for hundreds of millions of years, and the dynamo at the planet's heart generates a magnetic field that protects us from the most harmful effects of space radiation. Earth truly is a paradise for life.

Although scientists have known about these life-giving aspects of Earth for centuries, they're still discovering surprising connections between them. In a new study published last week in the journal Science Advances, scientists from NASA, the University of Washington, and the University of Leeds in the U.K. discovered a surprising connection between two of Earth's most important life-sustaining features—its oxygenated atmosphere and its magnetic field. 

It's hardly surprising that the existence of one of these features might impact the existence of the other. After all, Mars (which is also in the Sun's habitable zone) used to have an atmosphere, but without a robust magnetic field, the Red Planet eventually lost that atmosphere to the unrelenting lashing of solar winds. However, the authors of this new paper found that, on Earth, the correlation between these two systems runs much deeper than we previously imagined. 

“We find that both exhibit strong linearly increasing trends, coupled with a large surge in magnitude between 330 and 220 million years ago,” the authors wrote. “Our findings suggest unexpected strong connections between the geophysical processes in Earth's deep interior, the surface redox budget, and biogeochemical cycling.”

Analyzing data stretching back to the Cambrian some 541 million years ago, the researchers found that the rise in Earth's magnetic field and the rise in its oxygen levels were very closely aligned—slowly increasing overtime, except for one bout of increased activity lasting from 330 million to 220 million years ago. To map this comparison over the course of hundreds of millions of years, the researchers couldn't rely on direct data—there is no such record for atmospheric oxygen levels, for example. However, they could track the strength of wildfires, which show up as charcoal deposits in the geologic record. This would provide a clue, since a stronger, longer-lasting fire means that there was more oxygen in the atmosphere to fuel said fire.

To compare this record with Earth's magnetic field history, the team analyzed certain magnetic crystals that formed in ancient volcanoes and—due to their composition—essentially act like a “compass frozen in time,” according to Nature. Once plotted side-by-side, the team noticed that the two processes largely increased in lockstep with one another, and even experienced the same increase 330 million years ago. Interestingly, this coincides with the formation of Pangea, though scientists aren't sure exactly if the formation of the supercontinent is related to the increase or a coincidence, as the data does stretch back far enough to compare levels to other supercontinents in Earth's history. 

So, what's going on here? Well, the researchers aren't exactly sure, but they have a few guesses. The most likely one is that Earth's magnetic field directly impacts oxygen levels, as it protects Earth (and oxygen-producing plants) from solar radiation. However, it's also possible that increased oxygenation coupled with plate tectonics—which drive oxygen toward the liquid outer core that produces the magnetic field—could also play a role. The authors also aren't ruling out the idea that a third, currently unknown mechanism could provide an explanation for this steadily upward trend. 

“One single mind cannot comprehend the whole system of the Earth,” Ravi Kopparapu, a co-author of the study from NASA, told Live Science. “We're like kids playing with Legos, with each of us having a separate Lego piece. We're trying to fit all of it together and see what's the big picture.”

While 540 million years is an unfathomably long time compared to our human lifespan (or even our species' existence), it's only around 12 percent of Earth's entire existence, so these trends could simply be coincidental. All we can do is continue searching for answers among the clues that we do have, and try to grasp just how wondrous our home planet really is.

Salamander respawn powers could eventually be ours.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In the 1995 cyberpunk film Virtuosity, the genes of android villain SID 6.7 are merged with snake DNA, giving him the superhuman ability to regrow lost limbs. Axolotls can do that without even trying—in fact, it is possible for an axolotl to lose virtually any body part (even its brain and internal organs) and fully regenerate it. 

Mysteries surrounding these virally adorable amphibians' regenerative powers have fueled the sci-fi dreams (and frustrations) of scientists for almost two centuries, but not until recently did anyone understand the mechanism behind this ability. Now, molecular biologist James Monaghan of Northeastern University has made a breakthrough that has allowed us to identify the driving force of regeneration—and maybe, one day, we will be able to give this power to humans. 

Positional memory means that an axolotl somehow knows if it needs to grow back a lost finger, hand, or entire arm. This was already known to be the basic mechanism behind vertebrate regeneration, but what Monaghan found was that it begins with retinoic acid and the enzyme CYP26B1. Neither of these chemicals are exclusive to axolotls—both are also found in the human body. It is just a matter of axolotls being able to use them differently. Larger limbs at proximal sites closer to the body, such as arms, contain more retinoic acid and less CYP26B1 (which breaks the retinoic acid down). And in smaller sites further from the body, like hands, there is less retinoic acid and more CYP26B1.

“Regenerating limbs retain their proximodistal (PD) positional identity following amputation. This positional identity is genetically encoded by PD patterning genes that instruct blastema cells to regenerate the appropriate PD limb segment,” Monaghan and his team said in a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications.

When a predator bites an arm (or anything else) off of an axolotl, retinoic acid is synthesized in the middle layer of skin and spreads to the limb bud. This helps generate fibroblasts, which are connective tissue cells in humans, but regenerative cells in these creatures. Fibroblasts form blastema, or limb progenitor cells, which then grow and differentiate to recreate the particular limb that is missing. Blastema mirror the behaviors of limb buds that grow as an embryo develops, and in both embryos and adult axolotls that have been injured, positional information is exchanged between stem cells in the blastema and other cells in this budding limb to ensure that the appropriate tissues regenerate where they are supposed to grow. 

The gene Hoxa13 activates CYP26B1, which breaks down retinoic acid where it is not needed and uses it to create a pattern for the limb being regenerated. This breakdown determines how much retinoic acid is at an amputation site and, consequently, the position and structure of the limb which is regrown. Higher levels of retinoic acid activate the Shox gene—a transcription factor that both gives directions for producing a protein that regulates what other genes do and is involved with forming the skeleton. 

As Monaghan found out, defects such as skeletal abnormalities can occur if this process is disrupted. Raising levels of retinoic acid in an axolotl's hand caused it to grow not just another hand, but a whole new arm. Eliminating Shox with CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in normal hands but short arms, with bones that did not harden properly. This also occurs in humans with Shox mutations. 

What is especially amazing about axolotls is that they regenerate the limb in the exact same form it took before amputation. Some other animals that regenerate, like lizards, may grow back the end of a missing tail, but in a simpler form than the original. Much more research will be needed to transfer this ability to humans, but the materials are there. Healing wounds without scarring might even be possible in the near future. What we need to do next to make that future a reality is find out what happens inside blastema cells during regeneration, and which parts of these cells are targeted by retinoic acid.

“If we can find ways of making our fibroblasts listen to these regenerative cues, then they'll do the rest,” Monaghan said in a recent press release. “They know how to make a limb already because, just like the salamander, they made it during development.”

Self-esteem scores more than doubled within one year of weight-loss surgery, according to a new study* presented today at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting.

Researchers from Geisinger Medical Center found that after bariatric surgery self-esteem scores rose to 77.5 from 33.6 - a more than 40-point increase. The higher the score on a scale from 0 to 100, the higher the level of self-esteem and quality of life. The amount of weight loss appears to fuel the increase in self-esteem -- scores were highest among those who lost the most weight despite demographics differences including gender, age, and race or type of bariatric procedure.

Researchers used a prospectively maintained database to identify 5,749 patients aged 18 and older with body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more who had metabolic and bariatric surgery between 2006 and 2019. Patients completed the Impact of Weight Quality of Life (iwQOL) survey pre-operatively and 12 months after the operation to assess weight stigma and their quality of life.

"Understanding weight stigma and psychosocial factors associated with obesity is essential to offering holistic care. While these factors should not dictate the decision to have bariatric surgery, they should be an important part of the conversation," said study co-author Justin Dhyani, MD, Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, PA.

Weight stigma is associated with adverse health outcomes including depression, anxiety, disordered eating, and low self-esteem. Among adults with obesity, the prevalence of weight discrimination is 19% to 42%, with higher rates reported among those with higher BMIs and women.

"Weight stigma is a serious issue that places an extra psychological burden on patients struggling with obesity and there is no excuse for it," said Ann M. Rogers, MD, MD, FACS, FASMBS, President, ASMBS, who was not involved in the study. "This study shows we need to understand what patients are going through and be supportive and empowering of them as they navigate their health and make decisions about treatment."

For many, fitness trackers have become indispensable tools for monitoring how many calories they've burned in a day. But for those living with obesity, who are known to exhibit differences in walking gait, speed, energy burned and more, these devices often inaccurately measure activity -- until now.

For many, fitness trackers have become indispensable tools for monitoring how many calories they've burned in a day. But for those living with obesity, who are known to exhibit differences in walking gait, speed, energy burned and more, these devices often inaccurately measure activity -- until now.

Scientists at Northwestern University have developed a new algorithm that enables smartwatches to more accurately monitor the calories burned by people with obesity during various physical activities.

The technology bridges a critical gap in fitness technology, said Nabil Alshurafa, whose Northwestern lab, HABits Lab, created and tested the open-source, dominant-wrist algorithm specifically tuned for people with obesity. It is transparent, rigorously testable and ready for other researchers to build upon. Their next step is to deploy an activity-monitoring app later this year that will be available for both iOS and Android use.

"People with obesity could gain major health insights from activity trackers, but most current devices miss the mark," said Alshurafa, associate professor of behavioral medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

Current activity-monitoring algorithms that fitness trackers use were built for people without obesity. Hip-worn trackers often misread energy burn because of gait changes and device tilt in people with higher body weight, Alshurafa said. And lastly, wrist-worn models promise better comfort, adherence and accuracy across body types, but no one has rigorously tested or calibrated them for this group, he said.

"Without a validated algorithm for wrist devices, we're still in the dark about exactly how much activity and energy people with obesity really get each day -- slowing our ability to tailor interventions and improve health outcomes," said Alshurafa, whose team tested his lab's algorithm against 11 state-of-the-art algorithms designed by researchers using research-grade devices and used wearable cameras to catch every moment when wrist sensors missed the mark on calorie burn.

The findings will be published on June 19 in Nature Scientific Reports.

The exercise class that motivated the research

Alshurafa was motivated to create the algorithm after attending an exercise class with his mother-in-law who has obesity.

"She worked harder than anyone else, yet when we glanced at the leaderboard, her numbers barely registered," Alshurafa said. "That moment hit me: fitness shouldn't feel like a trap for the people who need it most."

Algorithm rivals gold-standard methods

By using data from commercial fitness trackers, the new model rivals gold-standard methods of measuring energy burn and can estimate how much energy someone with obesity is using every minute, achieving over 95% accuracy in real-world situations. This advancement makes it easier for more people with obesity to track their daily activities and energy use, Alshurafa said.

How the study measured energy burn

In one group, 27 study participants wore a fitness tracker and metabolic cart -- a mask that measures the volume of oxygen the wearer inhales and the volume of carbon dioxide the wearer exhales to calculate their energy burn (in kilocalories/kCals) and resting metabolic rate. The study participants went through a set of physical activities to measure their energy burn during each task. The scientists then looked at the fitness tracker results to see how they compared to the metabolic cart results.

In another group, 25 study participants wore a fitness tracker and body camera while just living their lives. The body camera allowed the scientists to visually confirm when the algorithm over- or under-estimated kCals.

At times, Alshurafa said he would challenge study participants to do as many pushups as they could in five minutes.

"Many couldn't drop to the floor, but each one crushed wall-pushups, their arms shaking with effort," he said, "We celebrate 'standard' workouts as the ultimate test, but those standards leave out so many people. These experiences showed me we must rethink how gyms, trackers and exercise programs measure success -- so no one's hard work goes unseen."

The study is titled, "Developing and comparing a new BMI inclusive energy burn algorithm on wrist-worn wearables."

“It must have taken days and days of work.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In 2018, the toppling of a tree near the township of Wawa, Ontario, revealed a rectangular piece of bedrock (about four feet by nearly five feet) etched with 225 symbols alongside a depiction of a Viking longboat. Eventually, a local historian came across the odd finding—now known as the Wawa Runestone—and reported the find to the Ontario Centre for Archaeological Education (OCARE). You can see the stone here.

The team at OCARE, led by archaeologist Ryan Primrose, decided to keep the stone concealed from the public until they could gather more details about its origin. And now, they're finally talking about the object for the first time. 

“Well, it's certainly among the least expected finds that I think I've encountered during my career,” Primrose told the CBC. “It's absolutely fascinating.”

Initial research, according to an OCARE statement, showed that the carving was likely written in Futhark characters—a runic script once used in northern Europe and Scandinavia. This led some experts to think that the carving must have been completed as far back as the Viking era, especially considering the second carving of a boat (which resembles a Viking longboat, contains about 16 occupants, and is flanked by several crosses or stars) found adjacent to the script.

Primrose, it turns out, was wise to hold off on publicly announcing it as a Viking-era find. In 2019, he brought in Sweden-based expert Henrik Williams, professor emeritus at Uppsala University, to consult on the site. Williams confirmed that the inscription was runic, but disagreed that it was Viking in nature.

Williams said that the runic writing was a version of the Christian Lord's Prayer, which had been carved in Futhark. “The text conforms to the Swedish version of the Lord's Prayer used from the 16th century and is written using a variation of the runic translation developed by Johannes Bureus in the early 17th century.” OCARE stated. 

“It must have taken days and days of work,” Williams told the CBC. “They are really deeply carved into the rock. Someone must have spent a couple of weeks carving this thing.”

While tough to pinpoint, OCARE researchers believe the inscription itself dates to the 1800s. Williams believes the creator of the carving had to come from Sweden, and as Primrose researched the history of the area, he found that the Hudson's Bay Company hired Swedes in the 1800s to work at remote Canadian wilderness trading posts—including the Michipicoten post, located not far from the Wawa carving, the CBC reported.

Whether this was a popular religious site—the inscription was found under soil after the tree fell, and no other artifacts have been found nearby—or the work of a single person toiling alone is still a question. 

But with this announcement, many other questions have been answered. “Canada now has a total of 11 objects claimed to bear runes but only five in fact do so, and three of those constitute modern commemorative inscriptions,” Williams wrote in an OCARE report. “The Wawa stone is Ontario's first with actual runes, the longest runic inscription of any on the North American continent […] and the only one in the world reproducing the Lord's Prayer.”

Metrics details

Iron is an irreplaceable co-factor for metabolism. Iron deficiency affects >1 billion people and decreased iron availability impairs immunity. Nevertheless, how iron deprivation impacts immune cell function remains poorly characterised. We interrogate how physiologically low iron availability affects CD8+ T cell metabolism and function, using multi-omic and metabolic labelling approaches. Iron limitation does not substantially alter initial post-activation increases in cell size and CD25 upregulation. However, low iron profoundly stalls proliferation (without influencing cell viability), alters histone methylation status, gene expression, and disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential. Glucose and glutamine metabolism in the TCA cycle is limited and partially reverses to a reductive trajectory. Previous studies identified mitochondria-derived aspartate as crucial for proliferation of transformed cells. Despite aberrant TCA cycling, aspartate is increased in stalled iron deficient CD8+ T cells but is not utilised for nucleotide synthesis, likely due to trapping within depolarised mitochondria. Exogenous aspartate markedly rescues expansion and some functions of severely iron-deficient CD8+ T cells. Overall, iron scarcity creates a mitochondrial-located metabolic bottleneck, which is bypassed by supplying inhibited biochemical processes with aspartate. These findings reveal molecular consequences of iron deficiency for CD8+ T cell function, providing mechanistic insight into the basis for immune impairment during iron deficiency.

Studies of metabolism in cancer and in different cell lineages have changed understanding of how metabolic processes regulate cellular transformation and cell fate1,2. In contrast, how common nutritional deficiencies influence metabolic pathways and alter cell biology is relatively poorly studied. Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide3, inhibiting erythropoiesis, impairing cognitive development and disabling immunity, and is a comorbidity for several disorders, including heart failure4,5,6.

Within cells, iron is utilised by ~2% of proteins and ~6.5% of enzymes (including ~35% of oxidoreductases)7. Key conserved biochemical processes are iron-dependent, such as the electron transport chain (ETC), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, nucleotide synthesis, DNA repair, histone and DNA demethylation and oxygen sensing6,7. Cells typically obtain iron by receptor-mediated internalisation of transferrin, a dedicated iron-chaperone protein in plasma and extracellular fluid8. However, the amount of iron bound to transferrin shows marked physiological variation. For example, in severe iron deficiency or in the presence of inflammation, plasma iron concentrations can drop by ~90%9,10, drastically decreasing iron supply to cells.

Notably, human genetic studies and pre-clinical work link decreased transferrin-iron acquisition by proliferating lymphocytes to impaired adaptive immunity5,11. Patients homozygous for a mutation in Tfrc (the gene encoding the transferrin receptor, TFR1, also known as CD71) that inhibits cellular iron uptake, have a severe combined immunodeficiency characterised by reduced lymphocyte function and suppressed antibody titres11. Similarly, low serum iron availability suppresses B and T cell responses in mice following vaccination and influenza infection5. How iron deficiency mechanistically impairs adaptive immune cells remains unclear, but understanding this issue could inform how iron regulates immunity and provide further rationale for correcting iron deficiency within human populations. Recent information summarising how iron influenced the immune system has been reviewed here12.

T cells dramatically remodel their metabolism post-activation, including upregulation of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), in order to meet the increased energetic and biosynthetic requirements of proliferation and effector function13. Transition from naïve to activated T cell is accompanied by greatly increased expression of the iron uptake protein, TFR1 and CD8+ T cell iron content is calculated to triple within the first 24 h post-activation14. In this study, we investigate how low iron supply influences activated CD8+ T cells via ‘omics approaches and isotope tracing. We find mitochondrial defects, dysregulated metabolic processes and stalled cell division, but show that a single amino acid, aspartate, rescues multiple aspects of cell dysfunction, including proliferation. These results offer insights into the molecular effects of iron deficiency within the immune system.

Iron is utilised by ~400 proteins, of which 204 are described to be expressed in T cells7,14,15. Iron-interacting proteins operate in a wide diversity of pathways ranging from mitochondrial metabolism to DNA synthesis6,7, suggesting that iron deficiency likely has important and wide-acting effects on T cell biochemistry. However, the specific effects of iron scarcity are difficult to predict because of the interdependence of cellular processes. We therefore took an unbiased approach to initially define the impact of iron limitation on global CD8+ T cell transcription and translation. We employed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative protein-mass spectrometry (protein-MS) of mouse OT-I CD8+ T cells activated in vitro across physiologically-titrated transferrin-iron concentrations (0.001–0.625 mg/mL holotransferrin, with total transferrin kept constant at 1.2 mg/mL) for 48 h (Fig. 1a). 0.625 mg/mL holotransferrin (15.6 µmol/L of iron) is representative of the levels of iron found in human sera (14–32 µmol/L of iron)16. Meanwhile, 0.001 mg/mL holotransferrin is much lower than levels found in plasma but may be reflective of the almost negligible levels of iron detected in lymphatic fluid17.

a CD8+ OT-I T cells isolated from mice were activated with 5 µg/mL plate-bound α-CD3, 1 µg/mL α-CD28 and 50 U/mL IL-2 for 48 h in a titration of holotransferrin conditions. Naïve T cells were collected on day 0.

In line with previous work showing that in vivo iron deprivation significantly reduces T cell expansion5, in vitro iron limitation profoundly suppressed cellular proliferation, measured using cell trace violet (CTV; Fig. 1b, c). Iron deficiency also impaired expression of the activation marker, CD25, while having no effect on CD44 (Fig. 1d, e). Surface expression of the iron uptake receptor, TFR1/CD71, was increased in low iron conditions (Fig. 1f) consistent with iron limitation18 while the amino acid transporter, CD98 (SLC3A2:SLC7A5 heterodimer; LAT1), which is induced post-T cell activation19, was significantly decreased in low iron conditions (Fig. 1g). In line with previous reports20,21, the cytokine, IL-2, was induced during iron deprivation (Fig. 1h). TNF was similarly induced with iron scarcity (Fig. 1i) while IFN-γ was unchanged (Fig. 1j). Therefore, in low iron conditions, stimulated OT-I T cells acquire some though not all characteristics of activation on a per-cell basis, and because of a failure to proliferate, overall, there are fewer competent effector T cells when iron is restricted. Notably, the impaired proliferation and altered effector function observed under low iron conditions are not due to a failure to activate. Cells cultured in both low iron and iron-replete conditions show robust upregulation of CD25 expression and increased cell size (measured as forward scatter) relative to naïve cells maintained in IL-7 (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Further, cells in low iron display a transcriptional profile distinct from naïve cells, which is substantially more similar to cells in iron-replete conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1c).

Despite observing dramatic changes in cellular division during iron restriction, only 193 genes were identified as significantly differentially regulated between iron-replete and deficient conditions by RNA-seq (Supplementary Fig. 1d; Supplementary Data 1). However, clear segregation was still observed between the two iron concentrations by principal component analysis (PCA; Supplementary Fig. 1c). Genes identified by RNA-seq as induced during iron deficiency also displayed an enrichment of the activating histone marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac at transcription start sites (TSSs) in the low iron condition (e.g. Cdkn1a; Supplementary Fig. 1e, f) when analysed by ChIPmentation. Meanwhile, genes suppressed by iron deficiency at the RNA level showed depletion of these activating marks around their TSSs (e.g. Asns). The positive relationship between the transcriptionally associated histone modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, with transcription suggests that RNA expression changes observed during iron deficiency are likely due to transcriptional differences rather than alterations in RNA stability. In contrast, the iron uptake receptor, Tfrc, showed no observable difference in Tfrc promoter H3K4me3 or H3K27ac but a significant increase in mRNA and protein expression in low iron conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1f–h). These data are consistent with the canonical post-transcriptional upregulation of Tfrc via increased mRNA stability under iron limitation by the iron-response element (IRE)/iron-response protein (IRP) system18.

Protein-MS analysis identified 116 differentially expressed proteins (Fig. 1k; Supplementary Data 2). As expected, TFR1 protein copy number increased as holotransferrin was depleted (Supplementary Fig. 1h). Despite the differential expression of 116 proteins, no differences were observed in overall protein mass or protein molecules per CD8+ T cell activated across a titration of holotransferrin conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1i, j), indicating that despite decreased cell division, iron-deficient CD8+ T cells do not accumulate extra protein.

5091 mRNAs/proteins were mutually detected by the RNA-seq and protein-MS with a significant positive correlation in the log2|FC| values (Fig. 1l). Of these, only 15 were significantly differentially regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 1k). These modest expression changes indicate changes in protein function rather than expression may be the predominant driver of the profound suppressive effect of iron deficiency on CD8+ T cell proliferation. Of note, 7 of the 15 mutually differentially expressed genes encoded proteins related to metabolism, including amino acid transporters (Slc1a4, Slc7a3) or enzymes (Dglucy, Ephx1, Asns, Cth, Pck2), indicating changes in cellular metabolism may underpin this functional alteration.

In addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), conducted on both RNA-seq and protein-MS datasets, also indicated altered expression of genes attributed to the p53 pathway (Fig. 1m, Supplementary Fig. 1l). The p53 pathway coordinates responses to cellular stress such as DNA damage, hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, with downstream effects including apoptosis, DNA repair and cell cycle arrest22. p53 has also been shown to regulate cellular metabolism with effects including glycolytic suppression and mitochondrial maintenance23. Altered activity of genes involved in the p53 pathway may therefore also contribute to the titratable impairment of cellular proliferation in low iron conditions (Fig. 1b, c). Consistent with this, expression of Cdkn1a (also known as p21, Cip1 and Waf1), a p53 target and suppressor of the G1-S phase cell cycle transition was induced by iron deprivation at 24 h, prior to the first cell division and continued to be upregulated as CD8+ T cells entered their proliferative phase at 48 h (Fig. 1n–p, Supplementary Fig. 1m). However, while cell division halted, cells remained viable at 48 h (Fig. 1q). Notably, Cdkn1a is induced by iron chelation in cell lines24. This data suggests that induction of Cdkn1a expression, potentially via the p53 signalling pathway, may contribute to drive cell cycle suppression, but iron deprivation does not cause cell death at this time point.

p53 induction during iron chelation has been described in cell lines, macrophages and CD4+ T cells25,26,27,28 and is understood to occur via HIF1α stabilisation due to impaired activity of their regulators, the iron and oxygen-dependent PHD proteins28. We therefore tested whether HIF1α was similarly stabilised in cells deprived of iron more physiologically, via decreased availability of transferrin-bound iron. While the iron chelator deferiprone (DFP) clearly induced HIF1α stabilisation in CD8+ T cells, low iron conditions did not alter HIF1α levels relative to iron-replete controls (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Moreover, the proteomic profile of iron-deficient CD8+ T cells bears little resemblance to the proteomes of 5 day activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells exposed to hypoxia for 24 h as reported by Ross et al.29 (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Both hypoxia and iron chelation have also been shown to induce glycolytic genes25,29, but this was not observed in our cells in low iron media.

Given the discrepancy between how HIF1α responded in CD8+ T cells under iron chelation and iron deficiency, we were interested to understand whether the difference in cellular response extended beyond HIF1α. We processed raw RNA-seq data from Wang et al.30 (not analysed in their manuscript) of Th1 polarised CD4+ T cells treated with CPX iron chelator or dimethyl sulfoxide control for 4 h. CPX-treated cells showed differential expression of 3523 genes, which is ~18-fold higher than the 193 differentially expressed genes identified in our model of low iron media (Supplementary Fig. 2d). CPX also failed to upregulate Tfrc (Supplementary Fig. 2e), suggesting that the IRP-IRE iron signalling system is no longer intact. While CPX iron chelation suppressed pathways associated with cell cycle (G2M checkpoint) and metabolic reprogramming (MYC targets; Supplementary Fig. 2f), similar to iron deficiency, only 45 genes were found to be mutually differentially expressed (Supplementary Fig. 2g). The extreme changes in transcriptional profile observed with only 4 h of CPX treatment relative to our 48-h culture model in low iron media and the failure to upregulate Tfrc suggest that the biochemical impacts of chelators can be non-physiological, especially if given at high doses.

We observed decreased activity of the key upstream metabolic regulator, mTOR, measured as phosphorylation of its target S6 (pS6; Fig. 2a–c) and downregulation of the MYC and mTORC1 signalling pathways under iron scarcity (Fig. 1m, Supplementary Fig. 1l). Decreased mTORC1 is consistent with lack of upregulation of glycolysis genes, reduced CD98 expression (Fig. 1g), and may also relate to lack of total protein accumulation in non-proliferating iron-deficient cells (Supplementary Fig. 1i, j). However, unexpectedly, we observed upregulation of proteins involved in mitochondrial processes, including OXPHOS and fatty acid metabolism (Fig. 1m). The enrichment of the fatty acid signature was driven largely by increases in β-oxidation proteins involved in fatty acid and branched chain amino acid breakdown rather than fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 2d). ETC proteins involved in the highly iron-dependent respiratory complexes I (CI), CIII and CIV were also upregulated. Consistent with increased abundance of these mitochondrial proteins, mitochondrial mass, measured with Mitotracker green (MTG), was also elevated in low iron conditions (Fig. 2e). Of note, by selecting for mitochondrially localised proteins using the MitoCarta3.0 gene set31, we observed improved segregation within the first two principal components of CD8+ T cells cultured in different iron concentrations compared to when all proteins were analysed (Fig. 2f, g), indicating mitochondrial proteins are disproportionately influenced by iron availability relative to all proteins detected.

Mitochondria are enriched for iron-interacting proteins, with 7% of mitochondrial proteins classified as iron-interacting compared to 2% cell-wide7. Aconitase 2 (ACO2) and SDH of the TCA cycle and CI–CIV of the ETC require iron cofactors for function32. Mitochondria are also home to haem and iron–sulphur (Fe–-S) cluster synthesis pathways32. Analysis of proteomics data from Howden et al.15 revealed upregulation of haem and Fe–S cluster synthesis proteins in T cells 24 h and 6 days post-activation (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). The heavy reliance of mitochondrial function on iron in combination with the upregulation of mitochondrial proteins suggests that mitochondrial function may be disrupted during iron scarcity.

To directly interrogate CD8+ T cell mitochondrial function under iron deprivation, we first assessed a metric of mitochondrial health, specifically levels of superoxide (O2•−)—a key exemplar of mROS species. As available iron declined, mROS levels increased in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2h, i). CI, CII and CIII of the ETC, which all require iron for electron transfer32 are key mROS producers33. Given the observed increase in ETC proteins (Fig. 2d), but lower availability of iron during iron restriction, we propose an imbalance in ETC proteins to iron cofactors may impair efficient electron transfer, resulting in increased mROS generation. Consistent with this, iron deprivation decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 2j, Supplementary Fig. 4a) and was previously shown to suppress mitochondrial ATP generation5. Upregulation of the mitochondrial superoxide detoxifying protein, SOD2, was also observed under iron scarcity (Fig. 2k), indicating compensatory mechanisms to suppress mROS, which at the lowest iron concentrations still fail to control them.

Taken together with the alterations in the mitochondrial proteome, these data indicate that iron-deprived CD8+ T cells may have defective mitochondrial metabolism. To directly assess this, we next performed stable isotope-based tracing coupled to metabolite-mass spectrometry (metabolite-MS). CD8+ T cells were activated for 24 h and then incubated with 13C6-glucose or 13C5-glutamine for a further 24 h under iron-replete or -deficient conditions. Here, minimal changes in overall abundance of the glycolytic metabolites, pyruvate and lactate, or the amino acids which may be derived from glycolytic intermediates or imported (alanine, serine and glycine) were observed (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, there were no significant changes in the abundance of total lactate or the fraction of lactate labelled from 13C6-glucose in the supernatants of iron-deprived CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c) together suggesting glycolytic activity was preserved under low iron conditions. This is consistent with minimal changes in HIF1α activity (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c) and in agreement with glycolysis being an iron-independent pathway (none of the enzymes involved in glycolysis require iron).

CD8+ T cells were activated as described in Fig. 1a. For tracing experiments, T cells were activated in standard media for 24 h and then incubated in media containing 13C6-glucose or 13C5-glutamine for a further 24 h. a Relative metabolite abundance from T cells cultured in low iron (0.001 mg/mL holotransferrin) versus high iron (0.625 mg/mL holotransferrin), normalised to spiked in glutaric acid.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

In these experiments we also noted that while ~20% labelling of 13C6-glucose into the TCA cycle was observed, 13C5-glutamine was much more readily incorporated into the TCA cycle, labelling 60-80% of TCA cycle metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 4d). The larger incorporation of glutamine relative to glucose into the TCA cycle is consistent with reports indicating substantial reduction of glucose-derived pyruvate to lactate in activated T cells, alongside increased glutamine anaplerosis into the TCA cycle34.

ACO2 is an iron-dependent enzyme in the TCA cycle, which converts citrate to isocitrate. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) then converts isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). In agreement with reduced TCA cycle activity, decreased abundance of α-KG was observed in low iron cells (Fig. 3a, b). Decreased α-KG M + 3 isotopomers from 13C5-glutamine and a trend towards reduced α-KG M + 2 isotopomers from 13C6-glucose support reduced ACO2 and/or IDH2 activity (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 4e–g). However, since α-KG is also produced from glutamate by the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), decreased α-KG may also reflect decreased activity of this enzyme. Indeed, decreased relative abundance of α-KG M + 5 mass isotopomers from 13C5-glutamine indicates a trend towards decreased GDH activity under low iron conditions (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 4e). Consistent with this, 13C-labelled glutamate accumulated in low iron conditions following 13C5-glutamine tracing (Fig. 3b).

The TCA cycle metabolite succinate lies upstream of the second iron-dependent TCA cycle enzyme (SDH). Consistently, we observed that while succinate abundance was depressed in iron limiting conditions (−23%; Fig. 3a, b), it was relatively accumulated compared to the downstream metabolites, fumarate (−47%) and malate (−41%), suggesting suppressed progression from succinate to fumarate (Fig. 3a, b). Decreased M + 4 13C-labelling from 13C5-glutamine into fumarate and malate also supports this (Fig. 3d–f).

Decreased oxidative TCA cycle progression, due to limited glutamine anaplerosis and ACO2 and SDH activity, agrees with diminished NAD+ reduction and consequent increases in the NAD+/NADH ratio (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Fig. 4h), also observed under iron scarcity. Since NADH is a positive allosteric regulator of GDH, this may also partly explain the indicated decrease in GDH activity35.

α-KG levels were decreased by ~40% in iron-deficient CD8+ T cells (Figs. 3a, b and 4a). α-KG is a substrate for many dioxygenases, including the histone lysine demethylases (KDMs)36 (Fig. 4b), and alterations in T cell metabolism have been shown to alter KDM activity and T cell fate37. Crucially, most KDMs require an iron catalytic core to mediate hydroxylation of histone methyl groups using α-KG and oxygen as substrates36. The unstable methyl-hydroxy intermediate spontaneously dissociates, leaving a demethylated product38,39. This dual dependency of KDMs for α-KG and iron means that a decrease of α-KG availability under iron limitation may exert a double hit on KDM activity, with potential impacts on the appropriate chromatin restructuring necessary for CD8+ T cell differentiation. The abundance of KDMs substantially increases upon T cell activation, with KDM6B being the second most upregulated KDM in CD8+ T cells14,15. KDM6B is responsible for the removal of the repressive histone mark, H3K27me3, a process critical for T cell differentiation and effector function acquisition40,41. Consistent with decreased activity under iron limitation, CD8+ T cells demonstrated a titratable failure to remove H3K27me3 relative to iron-replete controls, with H3K27me3 levels remaining almost as high as IL-7-treated, naïve-like cells (Fig. 4c, d, Supplementary 5a, b). Using ChIPmentation, we confirmed that H3K27me3 levels were significantly elevated at TSSs in iron-deficient CD8+ T cells relative to iron-replete (Fig. 4e, f). The genome-wide increase in H3K27me3 during iron deficiency agrees with the concept that iron deprivation generally impairs the activity of KDM6 enzymes during T cell activation. It is also possible that increased methylation by methylases could contribute to the H3K27me3 accumulation phenotype. These findings therefore indicate that altered CD8+ T cell metabolic activity under low iron may have direct implications for their epigenetic status and differentiation capacity. While we hypothesise that KDM6 impairment occurs due to iron deficiency coupled to suppressed α-KG production, KDM6 activity may be impaired by other mechanisms. For instance, ROS, which are induced by iron deficiency (Fig. 2h), have been shown to inhibit other iron-dependent, oxygen-dependent and α-KG-dependent dioxygenases such as the PHD proteins, which regulate HIF1α42. Of note, however, direct supplementation with cell-permeable dimethyl-α-KG failed to rescue H3K27me3 levels and cellular proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d) in iron-deprived T cells. This is consistent with KDM enzymes requiring all of iron, oxygen and α-KG. Thus, even if α-KG is no longer limiting, KDM enzymes will remain dysfunctional in the absence of sufficient iron cofactors.

Aspartate is produced downstream of the TCA cycle metabolite oxaloacetate and critically supports cellular proliferation through de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis43,44,45. In cancer cells, ETC inhibition or iron chelation impairs aspartate synthesis, resulting in suppressed proliferation of these immortalised cells46,47,48. However, despite TCA cycle inhibition, aspartate was unexpectedly higher in iron-deficient cells, with the majority derived from glutamine (M + 4 labelled; Figs. 3a, b and 5a, Supplementary Fig. 6a).

To understand whether nucleotide synthesis was altered downstream of decreased TCA activity in iron-depleted CD8+ T cells, we measured the abundance of nucleotides and their upstream precursors by LC-MS, observing that AICAR, a metabolite which lies two steps downstream of aspartate incorporation into purine synthesis49 was substantially decreased during iron limitation (Fig. 5b, c). PPAT, the initiating enzyme of purine synthesis, which has been predicted to be iron-dependent7 was also reduced in iron scarcity (Fig. 5d). However, whether PPAT enzymatic activity is reduced is unclear. Carbamoyl-aspartate and orotate, which lie downstream of aspartate incorporation into pyrimidine synthesis, were similarly depleted (Fig. 5e, f). Consistent with these observations, certain nucleotides and dNTPs were decreased during iron deficiency (Supplementary Fig. 6b–d), albeit to a lesser extent, which may be explained by their decreased usage under suppressed CD8 + T cell proliferation and associated DNA synthesis (Fig. 1b, c) or increased salvage.

Together, these data indicate that nucleotide synthesis from aspartate is limited in iron-deficient CD8+ T cells, despite overall cellular abundance of aspartate being increased rather than decreased (Figs. 3a, b and 5a). This aspartate accumulation could be somewhat explained by increased production by an alternative pathway, for instance, pyruvate anaplerosis to oxaloacetate via pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and a partial reversal of TCA cycling (Fig. 5g)50. Carbon labelling from 13C6-glucose through the oxidative (canonical forward) TCA cycle via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) results in entry of two 13C atoms into TCA cycle metabolites (M + 2 mass isotopomers)50. Meanwhile, entry of carbon from 13C6-glucose to the reductive (reverse) TCA cycle via PC produces M + 3 mass isotopomers. During iron deficiency, significant increases in 13C6-glucose labelling into M + 3 TCA cycle metabolites, including fumarate and malate, were observed, indicative of increased PC contribution to these metabolites and reductive TCA cycling from oxaloacetate to fumarate (Fig. 5h). M + 3 and M + 5 citrate isotopomers are also likely derived from PC routed 13C6-glucose atoms (Fig. 5h, Supplementary Fig. 6e). PC activity, evaluated as (malate M + 3−succinate M + 3)/pyruvate M + 3, as utilised by Elia et al.51, was also increased (Fig. 5i). PC protein also trended towards increased expression in low iron conditions (Fig. 5j) while PCK2, which mediates the reverse reaction, converting oxaloacetate to the glycolytic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) was suppressed (Fig. 5k) suggesting oxaloacetate production is favoured in low iron conditions. In line with increased PC usage, pyruvate supplementation provided a proliferative advantage to iron-depleted cells (Fig. 5l). A partial reversal of TCA cycle activity is also in agreement with the observed increase in the NAD+/NADH ratio (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Fig. 4h). This suggests that under iron limiting conditions, CD8+ T cells may utilise PC and a partial reversal of the TCA cycle to replenish the depleted metabolites fumarate and malate, circumventing the use of the iron-dependent enzymes, ACO2 and SDH. Alternatively, increased PC activity may be a consequence of a futile attempt to increase nucleotide production via aspartate. Aspartate accumulation under iron depletion could also be explained by decreased usage, as shown for nucleotide synthesis above. Aspartate is also used for the synthesis of asparagine, however at 48 h post-activation, CD8+ T cells in both iron-deficient and -replete conditions had not synthesised asparagine, indicated by the absence of 13C-labelling from 13C5-glutamine (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 6f). This agrees with previous reports that CD8+ T cells lack asparagine producing capacity (asparagine synthetase expression) at 48 h post-activation, but gain this later into their activation and differentiation45. Accordingly, asparagine supplementation provided no proliferative benefit (Supplementary Fig. 6g). Taken together, the increased abundance of aspartate alongside decreased nucleotide synthesis indicates that aspartate usage by nucleotide synthesis is suppressed under iron restriction.

To interrogate whether nucleotide abundance limits CD8+ T cell proliferation under iron deficiency, we first tested whether genetically increasing nucleotide abundance could rescue proliferation. Cellular nucleotide balance is maintained via the activity of iron-dependent ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and SAMHD152 (Supplementary Fig. 7a). While RNR enables production of dNTPs, SAMHD1 degrades dNTPs52. Consistently, Samhd1 deletion (KO) results in dNTP accumulation in lung fibroblasts53 and bone marrow-derived DCs54 and is assumed to operate similarly in CD8+ T cells. We isolated CD8+ T cells from Samhd1-KO or wild-type littermates and activated them as described above. Samhd1-KO CD8+ T cells were less sensitive to iron scarcity in terms of a block on proliferation relative to wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig. 7b). This effect was modest, likely explained by the fact that SAMHD1-KO prevents dNTP breakdown but cannot rescue impaired nucleotide production or iron-dependent RNR activity. SAMHD1-KO CD8+ T cells showed appropriate upregulation of Tfrc expression in low iron concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 7c, d) but failed to rescue CD25 or perforin expression (Supplementary Fig. 7e, f). Notably, SAMHD1-KO cells showed comparable expression of Cdkn1a (Supplementary Fig. 7g), indicating that increased nucleotide pools provide a proliferative advantage despite elevated Cdkn1a expression.

For aspartate to be utilised for nucleotide synthesis, it must be in the cytosol. Thus, an explanation for decreased aspartate usage could be inappropriate retention of aspartate in the mitochondria. SLC25A12/13 transports aspartate from the mitochondria to the cytosol in exchange for glutamate55 (Fig. 6a), but requires a proton gradient to mediate transport55, which is decreased in iron-depleted CD8+ T cells. (Fig. 2j). Therefore, it is possible that a reduction in ETC chain activity due to iron deficiency may impair the mitochondrial proton gradient, in turn inhibiting SLC25A12/13 and sequestering aspartate in the mitochondria where it cannot be used for nucleotide synthesis.

CD8+ T cells were activated as described in Fig. 1a with or without aspartate (40 mM). a Aspartate is synthesised in the mitochondria but must be transported into the cytosol by the proton-dependent transporter, SLC25A12/13, for downstream metabolism. b Viable cell counts, n = 5. c Percentage of divided cells at 48 h and d percentage of cells undergoing 3+ divisions at 72 h assessed using cell trace violet (CTV), n = 5. e TFR1/CD71, f CD25 and g perforin MFI, n = 5. h IFN-γ MFI, n = 4. i mTORC1 activity measured via phospho-S6 (pS6), n = 4. j SAICAR and k N-carbamoyl-aspartate relative abundance normalised to spiked-in glutaric acid, n = 4. l H3K27me3 MFI, n = 4.

We directly assessed whether supplementation of aspartate into cell culture media, such that it can be taken up directly into the cytosol, can rescue CD8+ T cell proliferation. CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro as described in Fig. 1a in the presence or absence of aspartate (40 mM). While CD8+ T cells in low iron conditions with no added aspartate showed almost no population expansion over 72 h of culture, the addition of aspartate increased the carrying capacity of the low iron culture by ~104 additional cells (Fig. 6b). When assessing division at 48 h using CTV, aspartate increased the percentage of divided cells from 25% in the lowest iron condition (0.0002 mg/mL holotransferrin) to 61% (Fig. 6c). At 72 h, the fraction of cells which could undergo three or more divisions in low iron conditions was profoundly increased with aspartate supplementation (increased from 7% to 56% in the lowest iron condition; Fig. 6d). Together, these data indicate that aspartate alone can substantially overcome the cell cycle impairment induced by iron scarcity and promotes a more profound recovery of cell division compared to exogenous pyruvate or Samhd1-KO.

While clonal expansion is critical for effective CD8+ T cell effector responses, other aspects of CD8+ T cell biology provide important indicators of function. Tfrc mRNA expression was increased in low iron concentrations, indicative of cellular iron scarcity, irrespective of whether aspartate was supplemented or not (Supplementary Fig. 8a). However, aspartate supplementation did permit CD8+ T cells to maintain high TFR1/CD71 expression in the lowest iron concentrations when expression typically begins to drop (Fig. 6e). TFR1/CD71 levels may drop in the lowest iron conditions due to induction of tristetraprolin (TTP), a protein previously shown to suppress TFR1 expression under prolonged iron chelation56 or may be due to decreased TFR1 protein synthesis under mTORC1 suppression (Fig. 2b, c). Aspartate may therefore provide benefit via promoting increased iron uptake capacity during iron starvation, although the mechanism is unclear. Independent of iron, aspartate supplementation also promoted CD8+ T cell expression of the activation marker, CD25, the cytolytic molecule, perforin and the cytokine, IFN-γ, indicating its availability within the cytosol supports multiple cellular processes beyond proliferation (Fig. 6f–h).

To understand if aspartate, in addition to altering cell proliferation and function, induces a shift in gene expression, we conducted an RNA-seq of CD8+ T cells in iron-replete and iron-deficient conditions, with or without aspartate (Supplementary Data 3). Samples were segregated largely based on iron concentrations rather than aspartate treatment (Supplementary Fig. 8b), suggesting that aspartate supplementation does not drive broad alterations in transcriptional profile. Aspartate supplementation induced relatively few transcriptional changes, with only 76 and 48 differentially expressed genes in high and low iron conditions, respectively. Notably, the transcriptional changes induced by aspartate in low iron conditions correlate with the changes mediated by aspartate in high iron conditions (Supplementary Fig. 8c), indicating aspartate has similar, albeit small, effects regardless of iron availability. Aspartate supplementation only marginally reduced Cdkn1a expression in low iron conditions (Supplementary Fig. 8d), indicating that the proliferative advantage conferred by aspartate is not entirely due to Cdkn1a suppression. GSEA revealed that the dominant aspartate effect is suppression of interferon (IFN) response pathways (Supplementary Fig. 8e) and was particularly driven by reduced IFN-stimulated gene expression. Similar effects were observed for aspartate treatment at high iron concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 8f). Notably, type-I IFN can have anti-proliferative effects that may be related to upregulation of Cdkn1a57. Thus, the rescue effect of aspartate on CD8+ T cell division may be partly facilitated if anti-proliferative type-I IFN signalling is counteracted.

Aspartate did not alter mROS generation (Supplementary Fig. 8g) but did increase mTORC1 activity measured via the expression of the downstream target, pS6 (Fig. 6i) and slightly suppressed the iron deficiency-mediated increase in the NAD+/NADH ratio (Supplementary Fig. 8h). Aspartate-treated CD8+ T cells also displayed increased glycolytic and total ATP production (Supplementary Fig. 8i–k) and increased the abundance of the purine and pyrimidine precursors, SAICAR and N-carbamoyl-aspartate, albeit not significantly, suggesting that aspartate partially rescues nucleotide production, whilst consumption likely also increases in these more highly proliferating cells (Fig. 6j, k). Finally, aspartate counteracted the accumulation of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 by iron-deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6l). Therefore, even in cells cultured in very low iron conditions, aspartate availability enables TCR-triggered CD8+ T cells to acquire an activated phenotype, reconfigure important aspects of their metabolism and proliferate.

Given the breadth and conserved nature of pathways involving iron-interacting proteins, it follows that iron deprivation would likely have broad implications on cell biochemistry, health and function, with potential knock-on effects at the tissue or systemic levels. Our work explains why iron depletion potently suppresses T cell responses in models of immunisation, infection and autoimmunity5,26,30,58,59. We also propose that the iron deficiency-associated perturbations described here may in part be responsible for cellular dysfunction in other cell types and tissues during iron deficiency.

Cells that undergo rapid proliferation are more likely to be impacted by iron deficiency than quiescent populations. This is because in iron-scarce environments, dividing cells will dilute out iron stores between daughter cells without exogenous iron pools to replenish the difference, and dividing cells have high biosynthetic demands. Meanwhile, quiescent cells can furnish iron-interacting proteins via internal recycling of iron cofactors. This principle is demonstrated by T cells homozygous for the TFR1Y20H mutation, which reduces iron uptake efficiency11. Quiescent naïve TFR1Y20H T cells are not noticeably impacted by the mutation but become extremely sensitive upon activation11. Moreover, some tissues, such as muscle, may be able to resist iron deficiency to some degree by upregulation of glycolysis60. However, the capacity to switch to a glycolytic programme may depend on having reduced demands for nucleotides and other macromolecular synthesis processes necessary for proliferation.

We demonstrate that iron deficiency in CD8+ T cells promotes an altered metabolic state. Iron deficiency caused relatively modest perturbation of the cellular transcriptome and proteome, at odds with the significant inhibition of proliferation. Iron deficiency acts most immediately to derail metabolism, with the most drastic effects on mitochondrial function. We observed decreased TCA cycle activity at the iron-dependent enzymes ACO2 and SDH, resulting in depletion of downstream metabolites. Despite suppressed TCA cycling, aspartate levels were augmented, but metabolites immediately downstream of aspartate metabolism, used for cytosolic nucleotide synthesis, were suppressed. We propose that aspartate accumulates within mitochondria due to iron-deficiency-associated suppressed activity of the proton-dependent mitochondrial aspartate carrier, SLC25A12/13. Remarkably, aspartate supplementation of culture media, assumed to access the cytosol directly, profoundly rescued iron-deficiency impaired proliferation and enhanced other functional aspects of activated T cells in both iron-dependent and -independent ways. Our results place disrupted aspartate handling front and centre in the metabolic derangements of cellular iron deficiency.

Iron deficiency induced profound alterations to the transcriptional and proteomic landscape with significant perturbations in metabolic gene expression, including suppressed mTORC1 pathway-associated genes and elevated OXPHOS and β-oxidation proteins. mTORC1 is essential for T cell metabolic reprogramming downstream of TCR stimulation for ATP and biosynthetic substrate generation required for activation61. Iron deficiency partially recapitulates the phenotype of mTORC1-inhibited CD8+ T cells, which feature reduced expression of ribosomal proteins15. However, in contrast to the decline in mitochondrial proteins observed with rapamycin15, we instead saw increased mitochondrial proteins, indicating that iron deficiency's impact on metabolism is not simply due to suppression of mTORC1. We hypothesise that the accumulation of mitochondrial proteins in low iron conditions could be due to augmented generation of mitochondrial proteins to compensate for suppressed mitochondrial activity or impaired clearance by proteolysis or mitophagy.

Increased H3K27me3 in iron-deficient CD8+ T cells is suggestive of KDM6 dysfunction. The inability of CD8+ T cells to remodel their chromatin environment likely has implications for cellular differentiation. Moreover, suppressed levels of α-KG and/or iron may be capable of inhibiting iron and α-KG-dependent enzymes more generally, including other KDM enzymes and the ten-eleven translocation DNA demethylases, as has been seen for KDM3B, which can act as an iron sensor influencing H3K9 methylation and mTORC1 activation62, and the PHD proteins, which regulate HIF1α28,63. However, iron scarcity did not stabilise HIF1α or induce a proteomic response resembling that induced under hypoxic conditions. Different iron-dependent enzymes have been shown to have differential responses to iron inaccessibility, likely due to different iron binding affinities and expression levels62. For instance, KDM3B has a 40-fold lower affinity for iron than KDM3A (KM[Fe] = 100 ± 30 μM and KM[Fe] = 2.6 ± 0.8 μM, respectively), providing rationale for why iron chelation results in accumulation of repressive H3K9me2 in a KDM3B, but not KDM3A, dependent manner62. Similarly, the PHD proteins have very high affinities for iron64, potentially explaining our result that iron chelators, which potently suppress iron availability, induce a HIF1α response while iron deficiency caused by low extracellular transferrin-iron supply cannot. Thus, iron deprivation does not blanket inhibit all iron-dependent pathways, and iron chelation does not fully recapitulate physiological iron deficiency.

In 1925, Otto Warburg proposed that ‘every living cell contains iron and that life without iron is impossible'65, referring to the fact that cell culture media requires iron in order to support cellular growth65. Activated iron-deficient T cells do not progress through the proliferative cycle, but also do not apoptose, as has been observed by others62. Cellular iron deficiency mediated by depriving physiological sources of extracellular iron imparts a distinct and dysregulated metabolic signature. Our findings demonstrate that a lack of iron alters mitochondrial function, with knock-on effects influencing utilisation of cytosolic and nuclear metabolic pathways, ultimately affecting cell identity. Iron-deficient activated CD8+ T cells are ‘stunned' but not moribund, and can be substantially restored by aspartate, partially overcoming Warburg's limitation. Aspartate is generally poorly taken up by cells, but our findings suggest that engineering cells, such as tumour-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cells, to overexpress the plasma membrane aspartate transporter (SLC1A1/2/3) could provide resistance to iron depletion, for example, in niches such as the tumour microenvironment.

This research complies with all relevant ethics regulations at the University of Oxford. Animal procedures were completed under the authority of the UK Home Office project and personal licences granted under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (ASPA) of 1998.

Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages and fed ad libitum A03 standard maintenance diet (SAFE diets, SAFE A03). The light/dark cycle was 12/12, and the temperature and humidity were maintained at 19–24 °C and 45–65%, respectively. OT-I CD45.1 mice on a C57BL6 background were acquired from Vincenzo Cerundolo, University of Oxford and Audrey Gerard, University of Oxford. Samhd1-KO mice on a C57BL6 background were acquired from Jan Rehwinkel54. C57BL6/J mice were purchased from Envigo. Mice of both sexes were used at 6–20 weeks of age. Sex was not considered in the experimental design. Mice were euthanised using a rising concentration of CO2 followed by cervical dislocation.

To manipulate iron availability, iron-free medium was prepared with RPMI 1640 media (Gibco, 21875034), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma Aldrich, P0781-100ML), 1% glutamine (Sigma Aldrich, G7513-100ML) and 10% iron-free serum substitute (Pan Biotech, custom ordered as iron-free based on P04-95080). Iron-free media was supplemented with set concentrations of human holotransferrin (R&D Systems, 2914-HT-001G/Sigma Aldrich, T0665) ranging from 0.0002-0.625 mg/mL. Total transferrin was kept constant at 1.2 mg/mL by adjusting human apotransferrin (unbound transferrin) concentrations (R&D Systems, 3188-AT-001G/Sigma Aldrich, T1147) accordingly. The highest concentration of 0.625 mg/mL holotransferrin (~15.6 µmol/L of iron) is reflective of the levels of iron physiologically found in human sera (14–32 µmol/L of iron16). Meanwhile, the low holotransferrin concentrations of 0.001 mg/mL are much lower than those found in plasma, but are hypothesised to be representative of highly iron-depleted environments such as those in the tumour microenvironment48.

Aspartate (Scientific Laboratory supplies, CHE2306) was dissolved in iron-free media by slowly titrating in 1 M NaOH (Sigma Aldrich, 30620-1KG-M) until aspartate was completely solubilised and the pH was ~7.5. Asparagine and pyruvate were dissolved directly into iron-free media at the described concentrations.

Plates for CD8+ T cell activation were coated with 5 μg/mL α-CD3 (Biolegend, 100239) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2–3 h at 37 °C. Lymph nodes and spleens (inguinal, axillary, brachial, cervical and mesenteric) from mice were sterilely collected in iron-free media and homogenised through 40 μm filters using EasySep buffer (Stem Cell Technologies, 20144) or an in-house alternative (PBS + 2% FBS + 1 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, AM9260G)) to produce single cell suspensions. CD8+ T cells were isolated from total homogenate using the EasySep Mouse CD8+ T cell (Stem Cell Technologies, 19853) isolation kit and EasyPlate EasySep magnets (Stem Cell Technologies, 18102) or EasyEights EasySep magnets (Stem Cell Technologies, 18103), according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells were optionally stained with CTV (Invitrogen, C34557) for 8 min at 37 °C prior to culture. Cells were plated at 0.5 × 106 cells/mL in iron-free media supplemented with defined holotransferrin concentrations (see section “Cell culture media”). Cells were provided with 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (BME, Gibco, 31350-010), 1 μg/mL α-CD28 (Biolegend, 102115) and 50 U/mL IL-2 (Biolegend, 575402). CD8+ T cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24–72 h.

CD8+ T cells were collected from cell culture plates and washed twice with PBS; cell pellets were immediately snap frozen on dry ice. T cell pellets were resuspended in 350 µL of RLT+ buffer from the Qiagen RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen, 74136) and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RNA extracted for RNA-sequencing, samples were treated on-column with the Qiagen RNase-free DNase I set (Qiagen, 79254) according to the method described in Appendix D of the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit manual (Qiagen, 74104). RNA concentrations were determined using a Nanodrop one instrument (Thermofisher Scientific).

cDNA was synthesised using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems, 4388950), and qPCR experiments were completed on a QuantStudio 7 flex real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, 4485701) using the Taqman gene expression master mix (Applied Biosystems, 4369016) and appropriate Taqman Gene Expression Assay (B2m, Mm00437762_m1; Cdkn1a, Mm04205640_g1; Tfrc, Mm00441941_m1). B2m was used as the endogenous control gene.

For RNA-sequencing, RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent high-sensitivity RNA ScreenTape (Agilent, 5067-5579) and corresponding sample buffer (Agilent, 5067-5580) on a 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent, G2991BA). Library preparation and bulk mRNA-sequencing to a depth of 30 million paired-end reads using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform was conducted by Novogene.

Read alignment was conducted using RNA-star to the Mus Musculus genome (mm39), and features were annotated using FeatureCounts from the subread package. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using EdgeR (R package) with the thresholds of log2|fold change| > 1.5 and an FDR < 0.05 applied. GSEA was completed using FGSEA (R package) and Hallmark pathways with a significance threshold set as FDR < 0.05.

CD8+ T cells were activated for 48 h, after which they were collected, washed twice in PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Thermo Scientific, 28906) for 10 min at room temperature with rotation. Cells were washed twice at 16,000 × g for 30 s, and dry pellets were snap frozen on dry ice.

Antibody binding buffer was prepared: 0.5% BSA and 1/200 protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC) in PBS. 10 µL of protein A dynabeads (ThermoFisher, 1001D) per sample were washed twice with antibody binding buffer on a magnet. Beads were blocked with 1 µL of antibody (α-H3K27ac, Diagenode, C15410196; α-H3K4me3, Diagenode, C15410003; α-H3K27me3, Sigma Aldrich, 07-449) in antibody binding buffer for 3–4 h at 4 °C with rotation. Just prior to adding the chromatin, the beads were washed with antibody binding buffer.

Cell pellets were resuspended in 120 µL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) with 1/200 PIC and transferred into Covaris tubes (Covaris, 520045). Samples were sonicated for 180 s using the settings aiming for 200 bp fragments. Samples were diluted with lysis buffer with 1/200 PIC to a 900 µL total volume, and 100 µL of 10% Triton X-100 was added to neutralise. Samples were incubated for 10 min with rotation. 10 µL of prewashed protein A dynabeads were added and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were placed on a magnet, and 250 µL of sample supernatant was added to antibody-bound beads. Chromatin/antibody/bead mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Samples were washed three times with 150 µL RIPA wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 500 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.7% NaDeoxycholate), once with 150 µL TE buffer and once with 150 µL 10 mM Tris pH 8, each time for 5 min. Beads were resuspended in 29 µL pre-warmed tagmentation buffer with 1 µL Tn5 transposase (Illumina, 20034197). Samples were incubated for 5 min with vigorous mixing at 1100 rpm at 37 °C in a thermomixer. 150 µL of RIPA buffer was added immediately to degrade the Tn5. Beads were washed once with 150 µL of RIPA buffer and then resuspended with 22.5 µL of ddH2O.

25 µL of 2X NEBNext Ultra II Q5 MasterMix (New England Biosciences, M0544S), 1.25 µL 5 µM universal adaptor primer and 1.25 μL 5 µM index adaptor primer was added to each sample. Samples were transferred to a thermocycler and the following programme was run: 72 °C for 5 min, then 95 °C for 5 min followed by 12 cycles of 98 °C for 10 min, 63 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 3 min. Following the 12 cycles, samples were incubated at 72 °C for 5 min and then held at 12 °C. Supernatants were removed and 50 µL of Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63880) were added and pipetted 10 times and then incubated at room temperature for 2 min. Beads were washed once with 150 µL 80% ethanol, incubating for 2 min at room temperature. The ethanol was removed, and the beads were allowed to air dry for 3–5 min. 11 µL of ddH2O was added to the beads to elute the DNA. The supernatant was collected.

DNA quality was assessed using an Agilent D100 high-sensitivity screentape (Agilent, 5067-5584) and the High-sensitivity D1000 reagents (Agilent, 5067-5585) on a 2200 TapeStation system (Agilent, G2964AA) and using a Qubit fluorometer. DNA sequencing to a depth of 10 million paired-end reads using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform was conducted by Novogene.

Data was analysed using the SeqNado analysis pipeline (https://github.com/alsmith151/SeqNado). Peak enrichment for H3K27ac and H3K4me3 was conducted for the promoters of genes previously identified as being differentially regulated at the RNA level by the RNA-seq.

CD8+ T cells were activated for 48 h, harvested and washed twice in PBS. Cells were fixed in 2% PFA (Thermo Scientific, 28906) for 30 min, washed and resuspended in PBS. Cells that were alive at the time of fixation were sorted by flow cytometry using forward and side scatter into PBS. Cells were pelleted and snap frozen on dry ice. N = 4 for each condition for the protein-MS experiment. Pelleted cells were lysed using the 2-step trypsin lysis protocol described by Kelly et al.66. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 µL TEAB digest buffer (0.1 M TEAB, 1 mM MgCl2, 1:80 benzonase, pH 8) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a thermomixer. The amount of trypsin for a 1:20 trypsin to protein (w/w) ratio was calculated, and 50% of the required trypsin was added. Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a thermomixer. The remaining trypsin was added, and samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a thermomixer. The samples were acidified to a final concentration of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and subjected to a C18 stage-tip desalting with the following buffers: condition (100% acetonitrile), wash (0.1% TFA), elute (66.6% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA), ion exchange (2:1 ratio of 100% acetonitrile to 0.1% TFA). Samples were dried using a SpeedVac at 65 °C.

Protein-MS analysis was performed as described previously67. Briefly, peptides were analysed on a Q-Exactive-HF-X (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer coupled with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS (Thermo Scientific). LC buffers were the following: buffer A (0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)). 2 μg of each sample were loaded at 15 μL/min onto a trap column (100 μm × 2 cm, PepMap nanoViper C18 column, 5 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Scientific) equilibrated in 0.1% TFA. The trap column was washed for 3 min at the same flow rate with 0.1% TFA, then switched in line with a Thermo Scientific, resolving C18 column (75 μm × 50 cm, PepMap RSLC C18 column, 2 μm, 100 Å). The peptides were eluted from the column at a constant flow rate of 300 nL/min with a linear gradient from 3% buffer B to 6% buffer B in 5 min, then from 6% buffer B to 35% buffer B in 115 min, and finally to 80% buffer B within 7 min. The column was then washed with 80% buffer B for 4 min and re-equilibrated in 3% buffer B for 15 min. Two blanks were run between each sample to reduce carry-over. The column was always kept at a constant temperature of 50 °C.

The data were acquired using an easy spray source operated in positive mode with spray voltage at 1.9 kV, the capillary temperature at 250 °C, and the funnel RF at 60 °C. The MS was operated in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode as reported earlier with some modifications68. A scan cycle comprised a full MS scan (m/z range from 350 to 1650, with a maximum ion injection time of 20 ms, a resolution of 120,000, and an automatic gain control (AGC) value of 5 × 106). MS survey scan was followed by MS/MS DIA scan events using the following parameters: default charge state of 3, resolution 30,000, maximum ion injection time 55 ms, AGC 3 × 106, stepped normalised collision energy 25.5, 27 and 30, fixed first mass 200 m/z. Data for both MS and MS/MS scans were acquired in profile mode. Mass accuracy was checked before the start of sample analysis.

Quantification of reporter ions was completed using Spectronaut (Biognosys; Spectronaut 14.10.201222.47784) in library-free (directDIA) mode. Minimum peptide length was set to 7, and maximum peptide length was set to 52, with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. Trypsin was specified as the digestive enzyme used. The FDR at the precursor ion level and protein level was set at 1% (protein and precursor Q value cutoff). The max number of variable modifications was set to 5, with protein N-terminal acetylation and glutamine and asparagine deamidation, and methionine oxidation set as variable modifications. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was selected as a fixed modification. Data filtering and protein copy number quantification were performed in the Perseus software package, version 1.6.6.0. Copy numbers were calculated using the proteomic ruler69. This method sets the summed peptide intensities of the histones to the number of histones in a typical diploid cell. The ratio between the histone peptide intensity and summed peptide intensities of all other identified proteins is then used to estimate the protein copy number per cell for all the identified proteins. A log2|fold change| > 0.585 (equivalent to |fold change| > 1.5) was used (as used in Howden et al.15). We also applied the typical p value threshold of <0.05 when comparing the high (0.625 mg/mL holotransferrin) and low (0.001 mg/mL holotransferrin) iron concentrations via a t-test as well as an additional threshold of p values < 0.05 when a one-way ANOVA was conducted across all conditions. GSEA was conducted using FGSEA (R package) and the Hallmark pathways. For analysing mitochondrial proteins, proteins were filtered by inclusion in the MitoCarta3.0 gene set31.

For heavy isotope tracing experiments, CD8+ T cells were isolated and activated as described above. Iron-free media with varying holotransferrin concentrations were prepared using phenol red-free RPMI 1640 (Gibco, 11835030) as phenol red can interfere with metabolite-ms. At 24 h prior to cell collection (24 h post-activation), cells were collected, washed and replated in media containing the heavy isotope of interest (13C6-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., CLM-1396-1) and 13C5-glutamine (CK Isotopes, CNLM-1275)) on plates coated with α-CD3. Iron-free tracing media was prepared using SILAC RPMI 1640 flex media (Gibco, A24945201), which lacks glucose, phenol red, glutamine, arginine and lysine. Arginine (MP Biomedicals, 194626) and lysine hydrochloride (MP Biomedicals, 194697) were supplemented at standard RPMI 1640 concentrations of 1.2 mM and 0.2 mM, respectively. For 13C6-glucose tracing, glutamine (Sigma Aldrich, G7513-100ML) was added at 2 mM and 13C6-glucose at 11.1 mM. For 13C5-glutamine tracing, 13C5-glutamine was added at 2 mM and glucose (Sigma Aldrich, 158968-100G) at 11.1 mM. Holotransferrin and apotransferrin, as well as activation reagents (BME, α-CD28 and IL-2) were added to the iron-free tracing media as described under ‘CD8+ T cell activation' at standard concentrations. N = 4 for each condition for the carbon tracing experiments. Metabolites were measured by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as described below.

Forty-eight-hour activated CD8+ T cells were collected, counted and 2−4 × 106 cells (experiment dependent, however, the same number of cells were used for all samples within an experiment) were washed twice in ice-cold 0.9% saline made with NaCl (Sigma Aldrich, 31434-500G-M) and ultrapure HPLC grade water (Alfa Aesar, 22934). Cells were pelleted and snap frozen on dry ice. Cells were extracted in 1:1:1 pre-chilled methanol, HPLC grade water (containing 1.75 μg/mL D6-glutaric acid) and chloroform. The extracts were shaken at 1400 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The upper aqueous phase was collected and evaporated under vacuum. Metabolite derivatization was performed using an Agilent autosampler. Dried polar metabolites were dissolved in 15 μL of 2% methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 25104) at 55 °C, followed by an equal volume of N-tert-Butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide with 1% tertbutyldimethylchlorosilane after 60 min, and incubation for a further 90 min at 55 °C. GC-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 6890 GC equipped with a 30 m DB-35 MS capillary column. The GC was connected to an Agilent 5975C MS operating under electron impact ionisation at 70 eV. The MS source was held at 230 °C and the quadrupole at 150 °C. The detector was operated in scan mode, and 1 μL of derivatised sample was injected in splitless mode. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The GC oven temperature was held at 80 °C for 6 min and increased to 325 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min for 4 min. The run time for each sample was 59 min. For the determination of the mass isotopomer distributions, spectra were corrected for natural isotope abundance. Data processing was performed using MATLAB.

CD8+ T cells were collected after 48 h of culture, and 3 × 106 cells were washed twice with PBS. N = 4 for each condition for the AICAR detection experiment. Dry pellets were snap frozen on dry ice. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.01% formic acid (Sigma Aldrich, 1003445799) containing 0.8 µM 15N2-dT (Cambridge Isotope Labs, NLM-3901-PK) and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min, and the lysates were collected and added to 3 kDa Amicon Ultra 0.5 centrifugal filter units (Millipore, UFC500324) and centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 × g. The filtrates were transferred to a mass spectrometry vial for analysis of compounds in nucleotide synthesis.

Samples were analysed on a TSQ Altis Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer in selected reaction monitoring mode, interfaced to an UltiMate 3000 uHPLC. The uHPLC was fitted with a nanoEase M/Z Symmetry C18 Trap Column, 100 Å, 5 µm, 180 µm × 20 mm (Waters) at RT and a Luna Omega 3 µm PS C18 column (150 × 0.3 mm) connected to an EASY-Spray™ source with an EASY-Spray Cap flow emitter (15 µM). Ten microlitres of sample were injected per run via a 10 µL sample loop. Buffers used were from Romil and of Ultra LC standard. Buffer A: H2O (0.1% acetic acid), buffer B: MeCN (0.1% acetic acid). The gradient was 0–2.8 min—1% B, 22 min—30% B, 23.5 min—99% B. This was followed by 2 wash pulses (1–99% B) and equilibration to 1% B (45 min total run time). The trap column was held at a constant 1% B, and switching from the trap to the main column occurred at 1 min and back at 40 min. Mass spectrometry conditions were as follows: source voltage of 2400 V in positive ionisation mode; ion transfer tube temperature 275 °C, CID gas pressure 1.5 mTorr, scan widths for Q1 and Q3 at 0.7 m/z, a chromatographic filter was used with a peak width of 6 s, dwell time 20 ms. Collision energy voltage, and RF voltage were optimised using the Thermo Tune software for the compounds assayed using authentic compounds dissolved in Buffer A. Peaks retention times were confirmed in samples by co-injection with the relevant standard.

Data was analysed using the FreeStyle 1.6 software and the Genesis peak detection algorithm with its default settings. Data was analysed by ratioing the target peak area with the 15N2-dT peak area.

CD8+ T cells were collected at 48 h post-activation, and 3 × 106 cells were washed twice with ice-cold 0.9% saline made with NaCl (Sigma Aldrich, 31434-500G-M) and ultrapure HPLC grade water (Alfa Aesar, 22934). Cells were pelleted and snap frozen on dry ice. N = 4 for each condition for LC-MS experiments. Metabolites were extracted with 100 µL of ice-cold extraction buffer (40% methanol (Biosolve, BIO-13687802), 40% acetonitrile (Biosolve, BIO-01204102), 20% water (Biosolve, BIO-23214102-1), 15 µM glutaric acid internal standard and 0.5% formic acid (Biosolve, BIO-069141A8)) for 5 min on ice. 8.8 µL of 15% ammonium bicarbonate (Supelco, 5.33005) solution was added to neutralise, and samples were left on dry ice for a further 15 min. Samples were thawed on ice and then centrifuged at 20 G at 4 °C for 5 min. Supernatants were collected for LC-MS analysis.

LC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent LC-MS QToF 6546 using a Waters Premier BEH Z-HILIC VanGuard Fit column (1.7 µm, 2.1 × 150 mm) with the following mobile phases:

Mobile phase A: 20 mM Ammonium hydrogen carbonate (LiChropur, Supelco) in LC-MS grade water (Ultra CHROMASOLV, Honeywell Riedel-de Haën) with 0.1% ammonium hydroxide (Alfa Aesar, Thermo Scientific) and 5 µM InfinityLab deactivator additive (Agilent Technologies).

Mobile phase B: 90% UHPLC grade acetonitrile (BioSolv, Greyhound Chemicals), 10% LC-MS grade water (Ultra CHROMASOLV, Honeywell Riedel-de Haën) with 5 µM InfinityLab deactivator additive (Agilent Technologies).

Five microlitre of sample was injected and the chromatographic separation was achieved with a gradient run with a constant flow rate of 0.2 mL/min and the following programme: T = 0 min, 10% A, 90% B; T = 2 min, 10% A, 90% B; T = 18 min, 35% A, 65% B; T = 22 min, 65% A, 35% B; T = 22.1 min, 85% A, 15% B; T = 25 min, 85% A, 15% B; T = 25.1 min, 10% A, 90% B; T = 30 min, 10% A, 90% B.

Full scan data was acquired between m/z 50–1050 at 1 Hz whilst using online mass correction. Analyte ionisation was achieved via ESI (negative polarity) with the following parameters: VCap: 2000 V, Nozzle Voltage: 500 V, gas temperature: 225 °C, drying gas: 8 L/min, nebuliser: 30 psi, sheath gas temp: 300 °C, sheath gas flow 12 L/min. Data extraction was performed using Agilent Profinder 10.0. Data were normalised to the internal standard (D6-Glutaric acid) peak area.

NAD+/NADH ratio measurements were made using the NAD/NADH-Glo assay (Promega, G9071) according to the manufacturer's instructions with modifications for measuring NAD+ and NADH individually (rather than pooled). Cultured CD8+ T cells were collected, washed in PBS and counted. 1 × 105 cells in 50 µL of PBS were lysed in 50 µL of 0.2 M NaOH (Sigma Aldrich, 30620-1KG-M) with 1% dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB, Alfa Aesar, A10761) per condition in technical duplicates. Each sample was split (50 µL) into a second tube for matched NAD+ and NADH measurements.

For measurement of NAD+, NADH was first degraded by adding 25 µL of 0.4 M HCl (Fisher Scientific, H/1111/PB17) to the first tube, heated to 60 °C for 15 min followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min. Twenty-five microlitres 0.5 M TRIZMA base (Sigma Aldrich, T1503-1KG) were added to quench the HCl.

To measure NADH, NAD+ was degraded by heating the second tube to 60 °C for 15 min followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min. Fifty microlitres of 0.2 M HCl (Fisher Scientific, H/1111/PB17) and 0.25 M TRIZMA base (Sigma Aldrich, T1503-1KG) solution were added to quench the NaOH.

The NAD/NADH-Glo detection reagent was prepared as instructed. Fifty microlitres of each sample (either purified for NAD+ or NADH) and 50 µL of NAD/NADH-Glo detection reagent were added to a white 96-well plate and mixed gently. The plate was incubated at room temperature and luminescence was measured using a Promega GloMax multi-detection luminometer at 30, 45 and 60 min.

Extracellular flux analysis (Seahorse) was conducted using the Seahorse XF Real-Time ATP rate assay kit (Agilent, 103592-100). The day prior to the assay, the Agilent Seahorse XF96 analyser was turned on, and a sensor cartridge (Agilent, 103792-100) was hydrated in sterile dH2O at 37 °C in a non-CO2 incubator overnight. The water was replaced by Seahorse XF calibrant (Agilent, 103059-000) on the day of the assay, and the cartridge was incubated for 1 h prior to loading the drug ports. The day of the assay, ATP assay media was prepared using 1 mM pyruvate (Agilent, 103578-100), 2 mM glutamine (Agilent, 103579-100), 10 mM glucose (Agilent, 103577-100) in Seahorse XF RPMI pH 7.4 (Agilent, 103576-100) and warmed to 37 °C. Cells were collected, washed and 1 × 105 cells in 50 µL of ATP assay media were plated per well on a Poly-D-lysine (Gibco, A3890401) coated XF96 microplate (Agilent, 101085-004). Plates were spun down, supernatant removed and cells incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a non-CO2 incubator, followed by the addition of 130 µL of ATP assay media and further incubation for 25–30 min. Oligomycin and rotenone/antimycin A were used at a final concentration of 1.5 µM and 0.5 µM, respectively. Twenty microlitres of oligomycin (15 µM) and 22 µL of rotenone/antimycin A (5 µM) were loaded into the sensor cartridge in ports A and B, respectively. The ATP rate assay was run on a Seahorse XF96 analyser with 3 measurements taken for each step (baseline, oligomycin, rotenone/antimycin A) using the following injection settings: 3 min mix, 0 min wait, 3 min measure. Data were analysed using the Agilent Seahorse Wave desktop software (version 2.6) and the Seahorse XF real-time ATP rate assay report generator.

Cells were transferred from cell culture plates to 96-well round-bottom plates and washed with PBS.

In intracellular cytokine staining experiments, cells were first stimulated with cell activation cocktail (1:2500) (Biolegend, 423301), BFA (5 mg/mL) (Biolegend, 420601) and monensin (2 mM) (Biolegend, 420701) in iron-free media at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 5 h prior to staining.

Cells were stained with 20 µL of surface antibody cocktail with Zombie NIR fixable viability kit (1:400-1000, Biolegend, 423105) in PBS for 20 min on ice. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Pierce, 28906) diluted in PBS or commercial fixation buffer (Biolegend, 420801) for 20 min on ice. For nuclear staining of markers such as H3K27me3, cells were fixed in Foxp3 transcription factor fixation buffer (eBioscience, 00-5523-00) for 1 h on ice.

For intracellular staining, cells were permeabilised in perm/wash buffer (Biolegend, 421002) for 20 min. Intracellular targets were stained with 20 µL of intracellular stain prepared in perm/wash buffer for 20 min to overnight. Cells were resuspended in PBS, and data were acquired using an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermofisher Scientific). Data was analysed using FlowJo (BD Biosciences). A representative gating scheme can be found in Supplementary Fig. 9.

Detection of mROS was conducted using MitoSOX dye (Invitrogen, M36008). Cells were resuspended in 200 µL of MitoSOX dye diluted to 5 µM in phenol red iron-free media and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 15 min before surface staining. The acquisition was conducted on live cells.

Cells were stained with MTG (M7514, Thermofisher Scientific) and Mitotracker Deep Red (MTDR; M22426, Thermofisher Scientific) at 100 nM in iron-free media for 30 min at 37 °C/5% CO2 prior to staining. Cells were acquired live. The ratio of MTDR to MTG was calculated as a metric of mitochondrial membrane potential relative to mitochondrial mass.

For flow staining for the metabolic regulators, pS6 and HIF1α, cells were washed once with a solution of 50% RPMI 1640, 50% HBSS (Gibco, 14025-092) and 0.5% BSA (PAN biotech, PO6-139310) before fixation in 1% PFA (Pierce, 28906) for 20 min. Cells were washed with PBS and optionally surface-stained for fixation of stable epitopes. Cells were permeabilised using 90% ice-cold methanol (Sigma Aldrich, 34860-1L-R) for 20 min at −20 °C prior to permeabilization and acquisition.

Cells were transferred into 96-well round-bottom TC plates and washed once with 2% FBS in PBS (FACS buffer). Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer containing 0.5 µg/mL 7-AAD (Biolegend, 420403) and incubated on ice for 10 min and then acquired directly on the Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermofisher Scientific). Fifty microlitres of cells were acquired per well to enable accurate calculation of cell concentration, and wells were resuspended using a multichannel pipette between each column on the 96-well plate to account for cell settling effects.

Unless explicitly specified, data analysis was completed using Excel (Microsoft), Prism (GraphPad), FlowJo (BD Biosciences), or published R packages. Statistics are specified in the figure legends.

Metrics details

The loss of organ function following traumatic injury is often irreversible and the demand for organ replacements continues to exceed supply. This discrepancy has driven the development of therapies and engineered tissues for the repair or replacement of damaged tissues. However, the survival of engineered tissues is constrained by the challenge of establishing a functional vasculature. Efforts have therefore focused on strategies that induce vascularization in tissue implants or stimulate vascular growth in recipients of the therapies. Here we discuss recent advances in vascular biology, biomaterials chemistry and 3D printing techniques for vascular patterning in engineered tissues. For tissue regeneration to be clinically viable, vascular formation must be guided across scales ranging from micrometres to millimetres through biological, chemical and physical approaches.

How Does a Gravitational Slingshot Work?

Spacecraft can get a significant boost by stealing energy from planets

By Phil Plait edited by Lee Billings

This artist's concept shows an example of a gravitational assist maneuver, used by spacecraft to travel through the solar system. In this example, the spacecraft flies close by Mars, then by Jupiter, each time receiving a boost that allows it to ultimately reach Saturn.

You've probably watched this sort of science-fiction scene more than once: some stalwart starship captain and their crew are fleeing from aliens/escaping a supernova /running out of fuel and are seemingly out of options, about to get eaten/vaporized/stuck. But then, just ahead, they spot a planet! So they head right for it, rockets blazing, then dive down and use its gravity to slingshot to safety. Hooray! Cue the triumphant music.

So it goes on the silver screen, at least. But does this maneuver work in real life?

Yes! Well, not so much the way it's done in movies—but it is an actual thing. It's widely known as a gravitational slingshot, though most scientists refer to it as a gravitational assist, and it's an essential tool for most interplanetary missions.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

The idea seems simple enough. As a spacecraft approaches a massive object, say, a planet, the gravity of the planet bends its trajectory, changing the spacecraft's direction. But there's more to it than that: the spacecraft can actually use the planet's gravity to speed up or slow down after this maneuver, allowing easier voyages to the outer or inner planets, respectively.

While the trajectory-bending part seems obvious enough, that speed-up-or-slow-down part is pretty counterintuitive. It's related to the symmetry of gravity.

If you hold a rubber ball some distance from the ground and drop it, the ball will accelerate as it falls, speeding up until impact. Then it bounces, moving upward and decelerating as it does so. It will eventually come to a stop, whereupon you can catch it or let it fall again. But either way, it can't bounce any higher than the height from which you dropped it. It gained kinetic energy—the energy of motion—as it fell but then lost it once again postbounce as it slowed on its way back up. This action is symmetric, so at best (if you had a perfectly elastic ball and did this experiment in a vacuum), it would bounce to the same height from which you dropped it.

The same is true for a spacecraft approaching a planet. The world's gravity will accelerate you as you fall in, you'll whip around at closest approach (that's the “slingshot” part), and then you'll lose that extra velocity as you move away because the planet's gravity is still pulling on you. As that gravitational grip slips away, the spacecraft will be moving relative to the planet at the same speed at which it initially approached.

So if all the bonus speed is lost on the way out, how can this maneuver be used to accelerate a spacecraft? The key is in the phrase “relative to the planet.” If you approach the planet at, say, 20 kilometers per second (km/s), you'll leave with the same speed. But that's your speed measured against the planet.

At that same time, crucially, the planet is also orbiting the sun. If you approach the planet from behind (that is, in the direction of its motion), then, as the planet's gravity gives you a boost, it also, in a heliocentric sense, pulls you along, adding some of its orbital velocity to yours. That gives you a kick relative to the sun, speeding you up on your way to your destination. In essence, the spacecraft gets a net gain in speed by stealing a little bit of the planet's orbital kinetic energy.

In turn, this means the planet actually slows a bit in its orbit around the sun—which sounds dangerous! But fear not: the planet slows in proportion to how much more massive it is than the spacecraft. Given a typical one-ton probe compared with a multisextillion-ton world, the planet doesn't noticeably slow at all. You could launch a million probes at it and never be able to tell the difference in its orbital speed. A bacterium bouncing off you while you're out walking would have a far larger effect on you.

The reason it's worthwhile to go to the trouble of gravitational assists is that spacecraft are launched by rockets, which can only accelerate to some top speed. For our current rocketry, these speeds are so low and the interplanetary distances so great that even the fastest, most direct voyages take years (or even decades for destinations in the outer solar system). You can load the spacecraft with more fuel to burn to go faster, but there's a limit to that, too. Fuel has mass, and you'd need to accelerate that extra mass, which takes more fuel, which has more mass. This catch-22 is described by what is called the rocket equation, and it means the amount of fuel you must add to move even slightly faster reaches prohibitive scales very quickly.

So shaving time off your voyage requires some other method—such as siphoning speed from a big, juicy planet along the way! For example, the Cassini probe to Saturn, which launched in 1997, was a huge spacecraft, the size of a school bus, and had a mass of 2.5 metric tons without fuel. (The addition of the fuel it needed to fulfill its mission at Saturn, along with the launch vehicle and other equipment, tipped the scales to 5.7 metric tons.) It would've taken practically forever to get to Saturn with the rockets we had then. So the mission planners took advantage of Jupiter, sending the spacecraft past it on a speed-boosting slingshot maneuver that shaved significant time off the journey. In fact, just to get out to Jupiter in the first place, Cassini also performed two fuel-saving flybys of Venus and one of Earth, stealing planetary orbital energy every time.

A gravitational assist works the other way, too. Earth orbits the sun at more than 30 km/s, so firing a probe at the sun or the inner planets is extremely hard because of all that sideways velocity. Instead mission planners prefer a more circuitous route. They launch the spacecraft with enough velocity in the opposite direction of Earth's path around the sun to drop in front of, say, Venus, where it can then donate some of its orbital energy to the planet to drop toward the sun even more. BepiColombo, a joint European Space Agency and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency mission to Mercury, did exactly this, passing Earth once and Venus twice to get in Mercury's vicinity. Even then, it had to do a total of six gravity assists past Mercury to match the planet's orbital speed around the sun. The last assist was in January 2025, and it will enter Mercury orbit in November 2026.

Gravitational assists are an emblematic example of why space travel is hard—it is exactly rocket science, after all. Gravity is the biggest culprit; just getting away from Earth in the first place is the largest part of the problem. It's ironic, then, that gravity can make reaching most of the rest of the solar system so much easier.

When the Earth froze over, where did life shelter? MIT scientists say one refuge may have been pools of melted ice that dotted the planet's icy surface.

In a study appearing in Nature Communications, the researchers report that 635 million to 720 million years ago, during periods known as "Snowball Earth," when much of the planet was covered in ice, some of our ancient cellular ancestors could have waited things out in meltwater ponds.

The scientists found that eukaryotes -- complex cellular lifeforms that eventually evolved into the diverse multicellular life we see today -- could have survived the global freeze by living in shallow pools of water. These small, watery oases may have persisted atop relatively shallow ice sheets present in equatorial regions. There, the ice surface could accumulate dark-colored dust and debris from below, which enhanced its ability to melt into pools. At temperatures hovering around 0 degrees Celsius, the resulting meltwater ponds could have served as habitable environments for certain forms of early complex life.

The team drew its conclusions based on an analysis of modern-day meltwater ponds. Today in Antarctica, small pools of melted ice can be found along the margins of ice sheets. The conditions along these polar ice sheets are similar to what likely existed along ice sheets near the equator during Snowball Earth.

The researchers analyzed samples from a variety of meltwater ponds located on the McMurdo Ice Shelf in an area that was first described by members of Robert Falcon Scott's 1903 expedition as "dirty ice." The MIT researchers discovered clear signatures of eukaryotic life in every pond. The communities of eukaryotes varied from pond to pond, revealing a surprising diversity of life across the setting. The team also found that salinity plays a key role in the kind of life a pond can host: Ponds that were more brackish or salty had more similar eukaryotic communities, which differed from those in ponds with fresher waters.

"We've shown that meltwater ponds are valid candidates for where early eukaryotes could have sheltered during these planet-wide glaciation events," says lead author Fatima Husain, a graduate student in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). "This shows us that diversity is present and possible in these sorts of settings. It's really a story of life's resilience."

The study's MIT co-authors include Schlumberger Professor of Geobiology Roger Summons and former postdoct Thomas Evans, along with Jasmin Millar of Cardiff University, Anne Jungblut at the Natural History Museum in London, and Ian Hawes of the University of Waikato in New Zealand.

Polar plunge

Snowball Earth is the colloquial term for periods of time in Earth history during which the planet iced over. It is often used as a reference to the two consecutive, multi-million-year glaciation events which took place during the Cryogenian Period, which geologists refer to as the time between 635 and 720 million years ago. Whether the Earth was more of a hardened snowball or a softer "slushball" is still up for debate. But scientists are certain of one thing: Most of the planet was plunged into a deep freeze, with average global temperatures of minus 50 degrees Celsius. The question has been: How and where did life survive?

"We're interested in understanding the foundations of complex life on Earth. We see evidence for eukaryotes before and after the Cryogenian in the fossil record, but we largely lack direct evidence of where they may have lived during," Husain says. "The great part of this mystery is, we know life survived. We're just trying to understand how and where."

There are a number of ideas for where organisms could have sheltered during Snowball Earth, including in certain patches of the open ocean (if such environments existed), in and around deep-sea hydrothermal vents, and under ice sheets. In considering meltwater ponds, Husain and her colleagues pursued the hypothesis that surface ice meltwaters may also have been capable of supporting early eukaryotic life at the time.

"There are many hypotheses for where life could have survived and sheltered during the Cryogenian, but we don't have excellent analogs for all of them," Husain notes. "Above-ice meltwater ponds occur on Earth today and are accessible, giving us the opportunity to really focus in on the eukaryotes which live in these environments."

Small pond, big life

For their new study, the researchers analyzed samples taken from meltwater ponds in Antarctica. In 2018, Summons and colleagues from New Zealand traveled to a region of the McMurdo Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, known to host small ponds of melted ice, each just a few feet deep and a few meters wide. There, water freezes all the way to the seafloor, in the process trapping dark-colored sediments and marine organisms. Wind-driven loss of ice from the surface creates a sort of conveyer belt that brings this trapped debris to the surface over time, where it absorbs the sun's warmth, causing ice to melt, while surrounding debris-free ice reflects incoming sunlight, resulting in the formation of shallow meltwater ponds.

The bottom of each pond is lined with mats of microbes that have built up over years to form layers of sticky cellular communities.

"These mats can be a few centimeters thick, colorful, and they can be very clearly layered," Husain says.

These microbial mats are made up of cyanobacteria, prokaryotic, single-celled photosynthetic organisms that lack a cell nucleus or other organelles. While these ancient microbes are known to survive within some of the the harshest environments on Earth including meltwater ponds, the researchers wanted to know whether eukaryotes -- complex organisms that evolved a cell nucleus and other membrane bound organelles -- could also weather similarly challenging circumstances. Answering this question would take more than a microscope, as the defining characteristics of the microscopic eukaryotes present among the microbial mats are too subtle to distinguish by eye.

To characterize the eukaryotes, the team analyzed the mats for specific lipids they make called sterols, as well as genetic components called ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA), both of which can be used to identify organisms with varying degrees of specificity. These two independent sets of analyses provided complementary fingerprints for certain eukaryotic groups. As part of the team's lipid research, they found many sterols and rRNA genes closely associated with specific types of algae, protists, and microscopic animals among the microbial mats. The researchers were able to assess the types and relative abundance of lipids and rRNA genes from pond to pond, and found the ponds hosted a surprising diversity of eukaryotic life.

"No two ponds were alike," Husain says. "There are repeating casts of characters, but they're present in different abundances. And we found diverse assemblages of eukaryotes from all the major groups in all the ponds studied. These eukaryotes are the descendants of the eukaryotes that survived the Snowball Earth. This really highlights that meltwater ponds during Snowball Earth could have served as above-ice oases that nurtured the eukaryotic life that enabled the diversification and proliferation of complex life -- including us -- later on."

This research was supported in part by the NASA Exobiology Program, the Simons Collaboration on the Origins of Life, and a MISTI grant from MIT-New Zealand.

Snap has acquired Saturn, a calendar app that helps students manage their school schedules and share them with others, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Friday. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Saturn will continue to operate as a standalone app.

The news was first reported by Engadget. 

Snap says almost the entire Saturn team is joining Snap as part of the acquisition, with just under 30 full-time employees coming on board.

Although Snap didn't share much about its plans for the acquisition, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that Snap will bring Saturn's calendaring expertise into Snapchat in innovative ways.

Founded in 2018, Saturn reimagines the calendaring experience by bringing in a social element. The idea behind the startup is to allow high school and college students to connect with their classmates and see which classes their friends are in without having to share a bunch of pictures of different schedules.

Users can share their schedules with their friends to see what they're up to in real time and what they have coming up in order to make plans. In addition to classes, users can share their schedules for practices, rehearsals, meetings, games, and more.

Snap says that Saturn is used by a large number of schools and that 80% of U.S. high schools have support for Saturn. Snap believes that Saturn has built its success by turning scheduling into a more engaging and dynamic experience. The two companies will work together to foster more real-world connections, Snap says.

Forbes reported in 2021 that Saturn raised $44 million in a funding round led by General Catalyst, Insight Partners, and Coatue, with participation from Bezos Expeditions, Marc Benioff, Dara Khosrowshahi, and Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary's Sound Ventures, among others.

TerraPower, the nuclear startup founded and backed by Bill Gates, announced a new $650 million funding round this week. The investment will help the company build its first commercial power plant.

Like other nuclear startups, TerraPower has been riding a wave of interest from hyperscalers, data center developers, and, now, chip designers. Nvidia's venture arm, NVentures, participated in the round, marking its first energy investment.

Bill Gates and HD Hyundai, both already on the cap table, also invested.

TerraPower started building its first power plant in Wyoming in June 2024. The company doesn't have approval for the reactor itself, though it expects to receive permits sometime next year. Given the Trump administration's benign attitude toward nuclear, that timeline seems reasonable.

When complete, TerraPower's first reactor will generate 345 megawatts of electricity, striking a middle ground between today's massive conventional reactors and tomorrow's promised small modular reactors.

TerraPower's Natrium reactors are cooled not by water but by molten sodium. The Natrium design uses far more sodium than is required to cool the reactor. That's by design: when demand is low, the reactor can continue operating, heating sodium that is then stored in large tanks. 

When demand rises again, the steam turbines can draw heat from the stored sodium. Because nuclear power plants don't easily ramp up and down, this allows the Natrium reactors to continue operating at a steady state.

The storage system is designed to produce up to 500 megawatts of electricity for more than five hours, helping to fill gaps in solar and wind generation.

The startup previously pursued a different reactor design, which it hoped to complete by the mid-2020s. But after uncertainties mounted, it changed course to pursue the current Natrium design.

TerraPower claims it can complete a reactor within three years after the first batch of concrete is poured for the reactor. Still, considerable site preparation and construction needs to happen before that occurs. 

And while there are signs that the first Natrium reactor will be cheaper than recent U.S. reactors, it won't be cheap: the Associated Press reported last year that the bill could reach $4 billion, half of which could be shouldered by the Department of Energy.

The RTX 5090 scams continue.

Nvidia's RTX 5090 is the latest GPU involved in a new scam, in which criminals are removing the GPU core and VRAM memory from RTX 5090s for their own purposes. Northwestrepair on YouTube received a Zotac RTX 5090 from a customer with no GPU core or GDDR7 memory chips attached to the PCB.

The card's original owner was apparently trying to find one of Nvidia's best graphics cards for a steep discount, paying just $2,000 for their RTX 5090. Technically, $2,000 is the RTX 5090's MSRP, but in today's market, RTX 5090s regularly go for almost $3,000 with some models priced as high as $4,000 thanks to high demand. Any RTX 5090 priced at MSRP (or lower) is well below the card's real value in today's market, which explains how the owner got scammed.

Northwestrepair received the Zotac RTX 5090 in good condition, except for one of the rear mounting screws which was completely stripped. The owner of the card allegedly tried to tear down the card himself but failed to do so and stripped some of the screws in the process.

After drilling out the screw, the repair technician was able to remove the Zotac triple-fan cooler, and confirm that the RTX 5090 completely lacked a GPU core and any VRAM modules. What was left was a perfectly healthy PCB, with all other components intact, including the power delivery system, 16-pin power connector, and display outputs. The only good news in this story is that the technician was able to get a free RTX 5090 donor card out of the whole ordeal.

This is the first major RTX 5090 scam we have seen involving modifications to the GPU itself. There have been RTX 5090 scams in the past, but those scams involved replacing the graphics card itself with other products, such as macaroni and rice or backpacks.

If history is anything to go by, these sorts of scams will only become more prevalent as time goes on. Nvidia's previous-generation RTX 4090 has been at the whim of all types of scams, including scams where customers received RTX 4090s without GPU dies or VRAM (too) and modified RTX 4090s that come with previous-gen RTX 3090/RTX 3080 Ti dies.

The best way to protect yourself is to watch out for RTX 5090 listings with suspiciously good deals and only buy graphics cards from reputable sources.

Mark Zuckerberg's AI talent hiring spree continues. In recent months, Meta tried to acquire Safe Superintelligence, the $32 billion AI startup co-founded by OpenAI's former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, according to a report from CNBC on Thursday.

Sutskever ultimately turned Meta down, according to CNBC, but the company is now in talks to hire Safe Superintelligence's co-founder and CEO, Daniel Gross. Earlier this week, The Information reported that Meta was in talks to hire Gross, as well as former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. Meta is also reportedly taking a stake in Friedman and Gross's joint venture firm, NFDG, which has invested in prominent AI startups such as Perplexity and Character.AI.

Gross and Friedman could significantly beef up Meta's AI superintelligence lab, adding leaders who have experience running and investing in AI research labs. Earlier this month, Meta announced that Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, and several executives from the data labeling startup, would join the company as well.

SoftBank is going all in on AI.

Just months after announcing its involvement in the $500 billion Stargate AI Infrastructure project, of which SoftBank is rumored to be fronting a cool $19 billion, the Japanese investing conglomerate is reportedly looking to launch its largest AI project yet.

The company is looking to team up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to launch a trillion-dollar industrial complex in Arizona to build AI and robotics, according to reporting from Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the project.

The initiative, dubbed Project Crystal Land, appears to still be in its very early stages. Despite SoftBank's desire to work with TSMC on the project, it's unclear what TSMC's role would be, according to Bloomberg, or if it would be interested in joining forces with SoftBank at all — TSMC already has its own AI infrastructure projects in Arizona in the works.

SoftBank declined to comment.

Meta's next generation of smart glasses is here, but it's not Ray-Ban doing the heavy lifting on design. This go-around, it's Oakley at the center, which may seem like a strange choice at first but makes more sense once you unpack how Meta is positioning its first new pair of smart glasses since its original Ray-Ban collab. In Meta's words, these things are all about “performance.”

What does that mean, exactly? Sports, mostly. This pair focuses primarily on athletes who want to capture footage from the field, or mountain, or wherever you might be wearing a pair of Oakley glasses and not look like a total rube. And given that positioning, Meta's new glasses, which are called HSTN and pronounced “HOW-stuhn,” unfortunately, will come with a few major upgrades over their Ray-Ban forebear. One big upgrade will be the camera, which will be higher resolution and capable of capturing video in 3K. Perfect for an action sports scenario where you'd want crisper, sharper video.

Meta's Oakley glasses will also have a longer battery life. According to Meta, the HSTN glasses will last up to eight hours with “typical use” and up to 19 hours if the glasses are on standby. The company also says the glasses can charge from 0% to 50% in 20 minutes. For context, Meta's Ray-Ban glasses last about four hours with “moderate use.” I can corroborate that battery life estimate, having worn Meta's Ray-Ban glasses as my main pair of sunglasses for the better part of a year, though sometimes I feel like I get a little less. Having a longer-life battery also makes sense from a “performance” sports-oriented perspective since you probably don't want to be charging these things up when you're hanging off the side of a mountain covered in fresh powder.

And, of course, Meta's glasses wouldn't be complete without some AI. Just like Meta's Ray-Ban glasses, Meta's Oakley glasses will come loaded with Meta AI. Meta suggests asking Meta AI stuff like “How strong is the wind today?” while golfing or triggering the video function hands-free by saying, “Hey Meta, take a video.” Again, having used Meta's Ray-Ban glasses extensively, my success with Meta AI has varied wildly. Meta's voice assistant is mostly fine for simple stuff like “take a picture” and “record a video,” but I've had very mixed results with more complex vision-based tasks like “What kind of car is that?” or even sometimes asking for weather and triggering specific songs on Spotify. What I'm saying is, take Meta's examples here with a grain of salt.

If you're really yearning for a pair of sports-oriented smart glasses and you're okay with Oakley's distinct style, then you'll be able to pre-order HSTN fairly soon. According to Meta, the full collection will drop later this summer for $399 while a limited-edition pair in a special colorway (Desert 24K Prizm Polar) will be available for preorder starting July 11 for $499 USD. That's a premium compared to the Ray-Ban glasses, which typically retail for $299, but at least you're getting some extra battery and a nicer camera to go with it.

Startups live and die by their early hires. And in a world where top talent has options — and stock options — you've got to offer more than a ping-pong table and a pitch deck to bring in the right people.

At TechCrunch Disrupt's 20th anniversary, happening on October 27-29 in San Francisco's Moscone West, we're digging into the real talk around compensation and equity with a powerhouse panel who've seen it all when it comes to scaling.

Don't miss the insights from this panel — and the full Disrupt 2025 lineup of tech and scaling leaders shaping the scaling discussions. Register here to save up to $675.

Randi Jakubowitz, head of Operations and Talent at 645 Ventures, knows what it takes to scale teams from the inside. Before helping portfolio companies find their footing, she was one of the early HR hires at Seamless, guiding the company through its merger with Grubhub and eventual IPO. She gets the people puzzle, and how to solve it under pressure.

Joining her onstage is Rebecca Lee Whiting, founder of Epigram Legal and fractional general counsel to some of the most cutting-edge AI and biotech startups around. She's built a reputation for demystifying legal complexity, advising on everything from equity structuring to retention strategies. Oh, and she also clerked for the Ninth Circuit, so she's not just startup-savvy, she's a legal heavyweight.

Then there's Yin Wu, the founder and CEO of Pulley, the YC-backed equity management platform that's helping over 5,000 companies take control of their cap tables. Before building Pulley, she launched and sold Echo to Microsoft and has a track record of launching (and learning from) startups. If there's anyone who knows what a great equity package looks like, and how to communicate its value to employees, it's Yin.

This session will cut through the noise to answer the questions every founder struggles with: How much should you actually offer early employees? How do you stay competitive with Big Tech without burning through your runway? And how do you structure equity in a way that makes people want to stick around for the long haul?Don't miss this one. It all goes down October 27-29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, part of the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt. The exact session time is coming soon, but trust us, you'll want a front-row seat — so register now and don't miss your chance to save up to $675 before rates rise.

Whether you're planning outdoor parties, heading out on a boat or setting up camp, having reliable power is a game-changer. Among the many options available, the Anker Solix C1000 portable power station is very popular, thanks to its impressive 11 ports to charge multiple devices at once, solar panel rechargeability, and battery longevity.

Currently, this huge power station is available for just $448, down from its original $799 (44% off) which makes it one of the most attractive offers in the power station market right now. At this price, you're getting a high-capacity power source that's perfect for everything from home backup to outdoor adventures.

See at Amazon

The core of the Anker Solix C1000 portable power station is a robust 1056Wh LiFePO4 battery, a technology known to be safe, long-lasting and reliable. In contrast to typical lithium-ion batteries, this battery will last for a decade with a maximum of 3,000 charge cycles. You can charge it every day for years and experience minimal capacity loss which makes it a long-term investment in its own right.

It comes with 11 ports and can charge virtually any device you bring along. It has SurgePad technology that delivers a record-breaking peak output of 2400W (and 1800W regular output) which makes it simple to plug high-power devices and tools. This compatibility is not very frequent in portable power stations and it prepares you for anything. The range of ports like AC, USB-A, USB-C, and so on is so vast that you can charge multiple devices at a time without losing anything.

With its UltraFast charging technology, you can get 80% charged in 43 minutes and a full charge in less than an hour with an AC input. If you want the greener option, the power station has capacity to accept up to 600W of solar input so that you can fully charge it in about 1.8 hours using compatible solar panels. This is a great choice for eco-conscious users and also for those who are planning longer trips off-grid.

Anker app enables you to personalize charging rates, access power data in real time and quickly manage your energy use. Such control is especially useful for several individuals or for times when you have to prioritize certain devices in the event of an outage or trip. The power station itself is designed to be mobile, 15% smaller than comparable 1kWh models which makes it very easy to transport and store.

It's a top choice if you're seeking reliable and portable power. Make sure you don't miss this all time low price.

Masayoshi Son, founder of SoftBank Group, is working on plans to develop a giant AI and manufacturing industrial hub in Arizona, potentially costing up to $1 trillion if it reaches full scale, reports Bloomberg. The concept of what is internally called Project Crystal Land involves creating a complex for building artificial intelligence systems and robotics. Son has talked to TSMC, Samsung, and the Trump administration about the project.

Masayoshi Son's Project Crystal Land aims to replicate the scale and integration of China's Shenzhen by establishing a high-tech hub focused on manufacturing AI-powered industrial robots and advancing artificial intelligence technologies. The site would host factories operated by SoftBank-backed startups specializing in automation and robotics, Vision Fund portfolio companies (such as Agile Robots SE), and potentially involve major tech partners like TSMC and Samsung. If fully realized, the project could cost up to $1 trillion and is intended to position the U.S. as a leading center for AI and high-tech manufacturing.

SoftBank is looking to include TSMC in the initiative, given its role in fabricating Nvidia's AI processors. However, a Bloomberg source familiar with TSMC's internal thinking indicated that the company's current plan to invest $165 billion in total in its U.S. projects has no relation to SoftBank's projects. Samsung Electronics has also been approached about participating, the report says.

Talks have been held with government officials to explore tax incentives for companies investing in the manufacturing hub. This includes communication with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to Bloomberg. SoftBank is reportedly seeking support at both the federal and state levels, which could be crucial to the success of the project.

The development is still in the early stages, and feasibility will depend on private sector interest and political support, sources familiar with SoftBank's plans told Bloomberg.

To finance its Project Crystal Land, SoftBank is considering project-based financing structures typically used in large infrastructure developments like pipelines. This approach would enable fundraising on a per-project basis and reduce the amount of upfront capital required from SoftBank itself. A similar model is being explored for the Stargate AI data center initiative, which SoftBank is jointly pursuing with OpenAI, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi's MGX.

Melissa Otto of Visible Alpha suggested in a Bloomberg interview that rather than spending heavily, Son might more efficiently support his AI project by fostering partnerships between manufacturers, AI engineers, and specialists in fields like medicine and robotics, and by backing smaller startups. However, she notes that investing in data centers could also reduce AI development costs and drive wider adoption, which would be good for the long term for AI in general and Crystal Land specifically. Nonetheless, it is still too early to judge the outcome.

The rumor about the Crystal Land project has emerged as SoftBank is expanding its investments in AI on an already large scale. The company is preparing a $30 billion investment in OpenAI and a $6.5 billion acquisition of Ampere Computing, a cloud-native CPU company. While these initiatives are actively developing, the pace of fundraising for the Stargate infrastructure has been slower than initially expected.

SoftBank's liquidity at the end of March stood at approximately ¥3.4 trillion ($23 billion). To increase available funds, the company recently sold about a quarter of its T-Mobile U.S. stake, raising $4.8 billion. It also holds ¥25.7 trillion ($176.46 billion) in net assets, the largest portion of which is in chip designer Arm Holdings. Such vast resources provide SoftBank with room to secure additional financing if necessary, Bloomberg notes

You realize Super Earth isn't an aspirational target right? We tune our justice system to be reactive because otherwise you quite literally have no liberty. You've locked it in a cage, and you've built a top-down controlled society instead of a bottom-up one that shapes itself. The very idea of "thoughtcrime" itself is something which shouldn't be lended any credence. The very act of trying to control thought, which is the foundation on which all modern society is built, should be repugnant. Our decisions have meaning because of the fact they need not be.In HD2, of course, this is lampooned and turned on it's head. Things like being "Free of Thought" are celebrated. Your own individuality is corraled into being little more than a tool to further the ends of a System, which is pathologically preoccupied with the goals of it's own persistence, and expansion.If, of course, my assumption was incorrect, you know this, and you were taking the piss out of HN, an uncomfortable number of which would jump at the opportunity to create that top down hell-state-of-affairs... Well, continue on and ignore this. If you actually desire that state of affairs, I truly, honestly beseech thee, look into how great history has gone the last bunch of times humanity got a buggering by this drive; and hope you may still be convinced away from mindlessly pursuing because it sounds cool until you realize you'll not be the one toggling the levers of power.That's all. PSA over. Have a nice day.

Since its release in March this year, the MacBook Air M4 256GB has been diligently shaving dollars from its price every week on Amazon. What started at a $999 launch price soon fell to around $950, then $900, and even as low as $850 at certain point.

And now, Amazon is selling this 256GB version in all color choices for a new all-time-low price of just $829 (17% off). And if that weren't enough, Amazon has also just dropped yet another all-time low price for the Mac Mini M4 from the same generation, so it's the perfect time to consider giving your desktop setup an upgrade as well.

See at Amazon

At $829, the MacBook Air M4 is a valuable bargain. The cost is especially irresistible given the model's rugged qualities: a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display, 16GB combined memory, and the lightning-fast Apple M4 chip. This is the kind of laptop that can easily toggle between intensive work tasks and creative work but still maintain a featherlight design that's so easy to carry anywhere.

The M4 chip is optimized for performance and efficiency and allows you to multitask among demanding apps with lag-free performance. Apple Intelligence, Apple's new personal intelligence system, comes directly integrated into the device. This system is a productivity game-changer with intelligent suggestions and automation without sacrificing privacy. With battery life of up to 18 hours, MacBook Air M4 matches the pace of your most hectic days.

You will also love the 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display (one billion-color display!) which delivers vivid images that make photos come alive with deep contrast and detailed clarity. Text is very crisp and reduces eye fatigue during long reading or typing. The audio and video capabilities of the laptop are equally stunning: a 12MP Center Stage camera enables you to show yourself at your best in video calls.

After the massive flop that was the Wii U, consumers had every reason to believe the original Switch, released in 2017, would be yet another Nintendo gimmick that would push people to buy a PlayStation or Xbox instead. But the original $300 Switch's handheld/console design, with its detachable Joy-Con controllers, proved to be a major hit with gamers of all ages. The handheld and TV-dockable game system was inventive and could be understood immediately. It felt like another Wii moment for Nintendo, only this time the Switch was the game console's final form. How could the company that gave us Mario, Pokémon, and Zelda possibly top that?

Apparently, with a $450 Switch 2 that has just enough new hardware upgrades and nothing too wacky. You get more performance, a bigger and sharper screen, Joy-Con 2 controllers that now magnetically attach and support mouse controls for exciting possibilities in shooters and real-time strategy games, and GameChat video and voice communications. The Switch 2 hardware is iterative—a specs bump—but it'll also be the exclusive platform for Nintendo's biggest and most recognizable gaming franchises. If you want to play Nintendo's latest and greatest titles, like the now-available Mario Kart World or the upcoming Donkey Kong Bananza, the Switch 2 is the only option, even if you have a PS5 or Xbox Series S/X.

In the same breath, Nintendo has also crafted a console that's more restrictive than any other similar device in recent memory. Only Nintendo could make game ownership so onerous when the hardware is this good and the top-quality games aren't available anywhere else. It's extremely frustrating that sharing games or managing game saves is so needlessly cumbersome on the Switch 2, and it's outright maddening that a company that's perfected making complex hardware easy to use—with arguably the best music and sound design—is also so reluctant to embrace how basic gaming features work on other, more open, game platforms.

Nintendo Switch 2

The Switch 2 has just enough new things to keep it interesting, but most importantly it lets you play original Switch and modern games with higher fidelity.

Pros

Cons

The Switch 2 is the communal console for our current gaming era. There is no better system around for couch multiplayer—especially one you can easily pack up and take with you. The Switch 2 is its own beast, and it takes the 8-year-old design of the original Switch and allows it to compete—and beat—the growing number of handheld platforms available today. With more horsepower for high-fidelity games like Cyberpunk 2077 and a slate of already-announced Nintendo-only games coming this year and next, we have very little fear that there will be a dearth of compelling titles for the Switch 2. Nintendo's new game console is no Sony PS5/PS5 Pro or Microsoft Xbox Series S/X, but at least it now has the performance to last well into the future.

Actually getting into Switch 2 games is more enjoyable than maneuvering around Nintendo's fascination with digital rights management, or DRM. Playing both new and old games on Switch 2 is a superior experience in every way. The 7.9-inch IPS LCD display is about 30% brighter than the original Switch's 6.2-inch screen, and it has wider dynamic range and higher contrast, which helps make games pop more. The screen also supports high dynamic range, or HDR (although the specifics are a bit more complicated), and can refresh games at up to 120Hz thanks to its variable refresh rate technology (VRR), which automatically adjusts the refresh rate based on individual content. However, VRR is inexplicably tied to handheld mode, and it isn't available when docked and connected to a TV or monitor.

We could play a variety of games in handheld mode and not feel like we were missing much, other than support for 4K. When the Switch 2 is hooked up to a TV via its dock, the device becomes a quiet powerhouse (the new inclusion of a fan in the dock for cooling definitely helps), at least for those games designed for its unique hardware. You can huddle next to the Switch 2 in handheld mode and not hear a mouse burp from the fans compared to the miniature jet engine you can occasionally hear blasting from a PlayStation 5.

With the original Switch, Nintendo proved that stylized, artistic-minded in-game visuals were the remedy to the graphics realism of other consoles and PC gaming. Simply put, its performance was underpowered even compared to a PS4 or Xbox One, both of which came out four years earlier in 2013. Its custom Nvidia chipset was, at times, overburdened by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild at launch. And when pitted against the current-gen PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, the original Switch was lapped hard. It's been eight years since the revolutionary Switch, so an upgrade was overdue.

Performance matters so long as it makes games enjoyable. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom running on the OG Switch at all was a minor miracle, but rampant frame rate dips inevitably made the experience worse. We've played the game on both the original Switch and Switch 2 with the $10 enhanced edition upgrade, and there's no question Zelda on the new handheld—even when bushes and other foliage tend to “pop in” or render only when you get close—is the better way to play the game. There's no way we can go back. Even games without a 4K upgrade, like Super Mario Odyssey, were a more enjoyable experience on Switch 2 at 1080p than the original at 720p. Would we buy a Switch 2 just to play original Switch games without upgrade packs? No, but we also know we have little reason to return to the 8-year-old handheld.

One hardware spec that we were hoping for was an OLED screen. For the uninitiated, OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a type of display technology that is desired for its true deep blacks. Unlike LCD screens that use a panel of backlights to illuminate pixels, OLED displays turn the individual pixels themselves on or off, allowing not only blacks that are pure black because they can be left off, but also the added bonus of power efficiency. Despite lingering love for the Switch OLED from 2021, it seems like Nintendo is saving the display tech for an inevitable mid-cycle refresh when sales for the Switch 2 start to slump. That will also likely make a $450 device even more expensive since Nintendo rarely drops the price of its systems. Case in point: Nintendo's still selling the original Switch for $300, the same price it cost at launch.

It's better to have a Switch 2 available to start with rather than waiting to spend potentially $500 or $550 for a prettier screen. The Switch 2's LCD display, with its support for HDR, is more than sufficiently vibrant that we weren't eyeing our Steam Deck OLED with any subtle or not-so-subtle envy. All this makes it seem like we're settling. Instead, all you have to do is compare the Switch 2's display to devices of this size and price. Even if the screen is LCD, the Switch 2 has a larger, brighter, and better-looking display than many other LCD-based handhelds that cost more. Yes, once you go OLED, it's hard to go back, but when you're in the thick of a game, whether or not blacks are dark grays isn't going to be what breaks any suspension of disbelief. Oh, and don't peel off the screen's protective plastic layer or you might just shatter the whole thing.

There are other delightful and easily overlooked improvements that Nintendo made to the Switch 2. The aforementioned Joy-Con 2 controllers connect with a satisfying click to the console using magnets instead of the sliding rail mechanism on the original Switch. Now, you just press the Joy-Con 2 release buttons located right below the ZL/ZR triggers, and they pull apart. Be careful, though, because accidentally pressing the release buttons when grabbing the Switch 2 from either side could mean dropping it. On several occasions, we caught our Switch 2 just in time before it took a hit to the ground. And speaking of the new magnetic attachment system—the SL and SR buttons tucked inside of each Joy-Con 2 are now larger, clickier, and made of metal. Additionally, while the U-shaped kickstand on the Switch 2 doesn't span the entire length of the backside like it does on the Switch OLED, it's at least not the flimsy gumstick-sized one on the original Switch. We're also glad to see the 3.5mm headphone jack didn't get removed, and it's nice to have a second USB-C port on the top of the device for charging or connecting accessories, along with the one located on the bottom. The built-in speakers are also audibly louder and fuller, producing clearer sound at higher volume levels compared to the crackling tinniness you got on the original Switch.

The Switch 2 feels good in hand, even if it's thinner than most other handhelds sold today. It's light, and we didn't have a problem sitting up with the device on a couch or bed for hours at a time. How many hours will depend on what game you're playing. For 2D games like the award-winning Hades, it'll last for a little more than four hours. For original Switch games like Super Mario Odyssey, we found the Switch 2 could go just over three hours before needing a recharge. Playing a graphics-intensive game like Cyberpunk 2077, we ran out of juice at exactly two hours. The Steam Deck OLED will do slightly better on battery life overall, but you'd have to look at $800 handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally X with its bigger battery capacity for anything better. Future versions of the Switch 2 may improve on battery life, but Nintendo would likely charge more for that, like they did with the Switch OLED. You can improve battery life by limiting refresh rate and HDR, but let's be honest, most of us would prefer a higher-quality experience over playing for longer. If you're noticing really poor battery life and think something might be up, you may need to put the Switch 2 into “recovery mode,” which should reset the battery indicator so that it's actually accurate.

About the only thing that gives us pause is the joysticks. The original Switch was notorious for Joy-Con drift, a hardware issue that caused the joysticks to register movement even if you weren't touching them. Nintendo originally didn't acknowledge Joy-Con drift, but later began repairing them for free after widespread outcry. Considering we've only had the Switch 2 for two weeks, we can't say if drifting joysticks will be a problem for the Joy-Con 2 controllers. Nintendo could have used Hall effect joysticks to guarantee Joy-Con drift wouldn't return, but the company didn't. Instead, Nate Bihldorff, Nintendo's Senior Vice President of Product Development & Publishing, said the Joy-Con 2 were “redesigned from the ground up.” Although we didn't experience any Joy-Con 2 drift, there are a relatively small (but increasing) number of reports claiming the joysticks still drift. The gadget teardown and repair experts at iFixit and CT scanning company Lumafield both independently suggest the joysticks, while improved, could still suffer the same issue with enough wear and tear over time; also, the magnetic attachment system may be the reason why Nintendo couldn't use Hall effect sticks. At the very least, Nintendo will repair any Joy-Con 2 controllers exhibiting the input problem for free.

The biggest surprise to us was how well Cyberpunk 2077 plays on the handheld. We picked up a physical game card version, which meant the download took less than three minutes before we were in the game, though the load times are slightly slower than if you're booting it directly from the Switch 2's 256GB of internal storage or from a microSD Express memory card sold separately. (Note: microSD Express cards are not the same as regular microSD cards, so you will have to buy Express-speed ones.) Game environments remain colorful and detailed, perhaps even better than at 720p resolution on a Steam Deck LCD. This is the benefit of when developers work hand-in-hand with the console maker to optimize the game to get the most from the hardware. The Switch 2 can also make use of Nvidia's DLSS (deep learning super sampling)—an AI-based upscaler that also helps improve frame rates for crispier graphics and smoother performance. DLSS can create some graphical glitches and odd textures, but those flaws can easily be overlooked.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a showcase for more than just graphics, but also how well the console can handle various control options—especially the new mouse controls. The feature has proved divisive, though not because the mouse sensor on the Joy-Con 2 is imprecise or you need a flat surface for the best results (they work surprisingly well on most pants, but the surface area won't be as large as a table). The cursor on menus and in games is responsive and quick, plus games like Cyberpunk 2077 offer a multitude of options for deadzones and cursor speed. The bigger issue is comfort. Most people won't find their hand can fully relax on top of a rigid Joy-Con 2 without room for the rest of their fingers. (GameStop sells a “mouse shell” grip to make the Joy-Con 2 more ergonomic, but we haven't tested it, so there are third-party “fixes” if you look for them.) Even with a grip that better fits a hand, you may find it hard to press any buttons other than the trigger without playing finger twister on the controller.

We wouldn't spend hours using only mouse controls, but already upcoming games like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond promise you'll be able to easily swap between mouse and joysticks just by placing the Joy-Con 2 on a flat surface. Quick-aiming and then going back to motion controls seems like the perfect compromise for shooters. A few of the minigames in Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour—effectively a $10 interactive instruction manual for the console—explore how these controls could offer innovative games in the future (and it's why it's so ludicrous Nintendo didn't package the “game” for free with the new console).

The Switch 2's Joy-Con 2 controllers simply feel like larger versions of the original ones on the first-gen Switch. Nintendo's new console is thin and light, and if you don't like the feel of it digging into your palms, you need to consider other accessories that add more grip. The Switch 2 is a device that lends itself to handing off a controller for quick and dirty multiplayer, exemplified by Nintendo's premier first-party title, Mario Kart World, which was the perfect launch game. We've played more than a dozen hours in the game with various groups of friends—all of whom were jonesing to try the ultra-hyped handheld—and they all left with smiles on their faces. The Switch 2 is running a custom Nvidia chip, and it's ostensibly as powerful as some of Nvidia's lower-end Ampere-era GPUs from four years ago—or about equivalent in power to consoles from the PS4 era. Even if it's less impressive on paper than what you expect from today's PS5-level graphics, the more important thing is whether developers can mold their software to the hardware. For example, even Mario Kart World four-player split screen didn't show any noticeable frame rate drops, and as hard as we looked, we didn't get the sense that the graphics were dumbed down.

Nintendo wanted to push the graphics capabilities for its new console, but it also offered an exclusive blast from the past for anybody willing to pay $50 annually for the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. The Switch 2 allows you to play a select variety of GameCube games, of which there are only three available at launch—F-Zero GX, Soul Calibur II, and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. All three are fun games in their own right, though none but Wind Waker are the kind of titles you “must play” before you kick the bucket. Nintendo also sells a $65 GameCube controller exclusively through its online store. You can't play the GameCube games or use the revitalized controller on the original Switch. Still, we wouldn't suggest you run out and grab a Switch 2 right now for such a limited selection of nostalgic titles.

The Switch 2 is as powerful as it needs to be for modern games. It supports current-gen features like ray tracing, at least to some small degree, and has DLSS to help it keep up with systems that are rendering games natively. How well it will stack up with future hardware from PlayStation and Xbox is a more difficult question. Game developers will need to program with the Switch 2 in mind, especially if they try to port any ultra-demanding title like Grand Theft Auto VI in the future.

As good as the Switch 2 is for local co-op in regular sessions of Split Fiction or Mario Kart World, Nintendo still hasn't figured out what players want from online multiplayer. Playing games with online video and voice chat is hampered by subpar camera and mic capabilities. The Switch 2's minuscule built-in microphone is supposed to pick up your voice even when you're a good six to eight feet from the TV. In our tests with a colleague, we found that you really need to be at least four feet from the mic for it to pick up your voice. On our colleague's end, he wasn't clearly audible until he took the Switch 2 off the dock and held it in front of his face. Hori's Piranha-shaped camera has a lower 480p resolution compared to Nintendo's official $55 Switch 2 Camera, but the fact that it can clip to the Switch 2's top USB-C port without a dangling cable or stand should theoretically make microphone pickup better.

Nintendo wanted GameChat to be such a defining feature on Switch 2 that it put a “C” button on all its first-party controllers. The button allows you to quickly send or receive calls and change video settings without going to the main menu. Of course, it's not as easy as it sounds. You can only send calls to friends over Switch Online, and you need to provide a phone number when you first try the feature. We used GameChat with the Switch 2 Camera, which users are expected to plug into the console when it's docked to a TV. Despite having 1080p resolution, its video quality is washed out in light, and it grows extra pixelated in low-light environments. Over GameChat, you have the choice of sharing your full video or your cropped-out body. The background blur software built into the Switch 2 is so poor that it makes early pandemic Zoom calls look like Google Beam by comparison. There's probably a generation of younger players who will be playing separate sessions of Fortnite who want to see each other's gameplay on their screen. GameChat is functional, but that's the best word we could use for it.

We hold the Switch 2 in our hands with a sense of foreboding. Because of virtual game cards, the games you own are locked to a single system at a time. You can mitigate this by going into your account settings and turning on “Use Online License,” which lets you have games on two consoles at once. The problem is, two systems with the same account profile can't play the game at the same time. Plus, your save data will remain tied to one system at a time—as we learned the hard way, moving a game save from one Switch to another deletes it off the original one instead of copying it over like how it works on every other game system. Either way, due to the proliferation of code-in-a-box and game key cards (a cartridge that's a “key” to downloading a game from the eShop and must be inserted in the Switch 2 to play said game), Nintendo has made owning your games far trickier. Features like GameShare are amazing for playing titles with friends who don't own them or don't even have a Switch 2, but since it only supports a mere six first-party games at launch, the feature is overshadowed by Nintendo's leering gaze that mandates you can't have your games—or even your game save data—in more than one place at a time.

Games now come in four flavors: game card, game key card, code-in-a-box, and digital download. Games installed on the Switch 2's internal storage will load the fastest, but with only 256GB, it'll run out fast. You may be thinking 256GB—eight times the 32GB in the original Switch—seems like plenty, and maybe it is if you're sticking to smaller indie games, but the Switch 2 operating system eats up about 10GB and games like Cyberpunk 2077 hog up 60GB; Split Fiction uses close to 70GB. Other third-party titles like Street Fighter 6 and Yakuza 0 will take up almost 48GB and 54GB, respectively. A microSD Express card, especially if you're planning to install Switch games and Switch 2 titles, helps alleviate these issues at a cost (we paid $60 for 256GB from Samsung), but the lingering problems with virtual game cards mean it's that much harder to own your games and easily swap them between friends. You can't simply offer your account to your friend so they can play your games on their Switch or Switch 2. Both consoles have to be nearby, and you can only give them a two-week trial to play that game, which also temporarily removes it from your own account. Changing your license settings keeps you from sharing virtual game cards in this way.

Nintendo will sell consoles because fans can't get enough of its exclusive games. At the time of this writing—two weeks after launch—all signs already point to the Switch 2 being a mega mushroom-sized success. People worldwide turned up on launch day in record numbers—many even attending midnight launches—to buy Nintendo's new game system. Nintendo's already shattered global sales records with over 3.5 million Switch 2 units sold within its first four days of going on sale. That's a lot of damn Switch 2 units sold just to play a refreshed version of Mario Kart and Cyberpunk 2077, a game that came out five years ago.

Do we yearn for the days of Nintendo introducing a new gimmick with every new console release? Yes, but the Switch 2 is the familiar sequel to the original Switch, as the iPhone 3G was the successor to the first-gen iPhone. The Switch 2 is more powerful, and games run better in every way, but Nintendo routinely proves that if you design games specific to hardware, you'll get more out of them—not just in graphics but in controls and gameplay.

The Switch 2 is the console that we'll keep with us often, perhaps even closer than our Steam Decks because we may bring it out for a single session on the go or share it with friends in various ways that you can't with a PS5, Xbox, or PC. There were few wholly new, must-have games on launch day, but they're coming. Nintendo knows a steady release of games featuring its most beloved characters will keep the Switch 2 momentum going. Third-party developers have been dying for more power to port their typically more graphics-intensive games to Nintendo's consoles—and now they're getting just that. So long as there's no drought of big game releases—like there were in the dark GameCube and Wii U days—Nintendo may just “1-Up” itself with the Switch 2.

A new report indicates that Taiwan manufacturing giant Foxconn and Nvidia are in talks over the prospect of deploying humanoid robots at a new Foxconn facility in Houston. It is purported the bots would be used in the construction of Nvidia's new GB300 AI servers, which will go into production of at the plant next year, according to Reuters.

As the report notes, the milestone would mark the first time an Nvidia product has been made using humanoid robots, and would mark the first Foxconn AI server factory to deploy the tech on its production lines.

If deployment gets the go ahead, the report claims the rollout will be finalized in the coming months, promising to transform the manufacturing process.

Both Foxconn and Nvidia are reportedly trialling humanoid robots, the latter using China's UBTech. However, according to the report, it is unclear at this stage what type of robots would be used in the Houston factory, what they would look like, or how many would be used.

A more specific timeframe suggests the companies are targeting the first quarter of 2026 to begin the project, which would coincide with the start-up of Nvidia GB300 AI servers at the plant.

As to the role of the robots, Foxconn has allegedly trained them to pick up and put down objects, insert cables, and do assembly work. The Houston factory is tipped as a great proving ground because it's newer and larger, with more space than Foxconn's existing facilities.

Later this year, Foxconn is expected to showcase two new robots, one a humanoid model with legs, and the other a wheeled autonomous robot base.

At a recent June keynote at GTC Paris, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang touted the company's enormous efforts to help develop robots for all manner of applications. Huang even invited AI robot Grek onto the stage for an adorable segment as he showcased the power of the Nvidia, DeepMind, and Disney project Newton. Nvidia's mechanized aspirations also seem to extend to its own supply chain.

AMD will go beyond Xbox consoles with its new custom chip roadmap


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD has announced future plans to expand its roster of gaming-centric chip designs beyond the Xbox and PlayStation ecosystems. The company announced on YouTube that it is creating a full roadmap of gaming-optimized chips, powered by Ryzen and Radeon, that are tailor-made for consoles, handhelds, PCs, and the cloud. How this differs from its current lineup remains to be seen.

This news comes days after Microsoft announced its extended partnership with AMD to build its next-generation Xbox console (codenamed Xbox Next) and future Xbox handheld gaming PCs. AMD's announcement is somewhat vague, but it reveals the company wants to expand its existing portfolio of gaming chips, such as the Z1 and Z2 series, to build a whole ecosystem of gaming-focused chips tailor-made for all platforms in the gaming industry.

Lisa Su also confirmed that these upcoming chips will be backward compatible with older hardware and cross-compatible with various platforms (suggesting all of these chips will be x86-based). AI-gaming technologies will also be supported, including AI-based upscaling "...that includes new foundational models to accelerate the state of the art in rendering."

AMD has yet to release this future roadmap, but undoubtedly, these new chips will include successors to the Z2 series that are currently on the market for handheld gaming PCs, as well as a variety of other chips to suit other markets. We can expect most (if not all) of these future chips to be APU-based, since all of AMD's previous custom chip designs (for gaming systems) have been APUs, ranging from the custom AMD silicon in the Xbox 360 all the way to the Steam Deck's Van Gogh APU and custom silicon in the Xbox Series X, Series S and PS5/Pro consoles.

Providing gaming-focused APUs will give more manufacturers and potentially DIYers (on the PC side) new ways to build future gaming systems, but it remains to be seen how the new roadmap will be aligned.

Research suggests that while cutting calories might help you lose weight and reduce risk of disease, it also carries health risks.

Living comes with a side effect: aging. Despite what you might hear on social media or in advertisements, there are no drugs that are known to slow or reverse human aging. But there's some evidence to support another approach: cutting back on calories.

Caloric restriction (reducing your intake of calories) and intermittent fasting (switching between fasting and eating normally on a fixed schedule) can help with weight loss. But they may also offer protection against some health conditions. And some believe such diets might even help you live longer—a finding supported by new research out this week. (Longevity enthusiast Bryan Johnson famously claims to eat his last meal of the day at 12pm.)

Move over, BMI. It's time to get SAD.

But the full picture is not so simple. Weight loss isn't always healthy and neither is restricting your calorie intake, especially if your BMI is low to begin with. Some scientists warn that, based on evidence in animals, it could negatively impact wound healing, metabolism and bone density. This week let's take a closer look at the benefits—and risks—of caloric restriction.

Eating less can make animals live longer. This remarkable finding has been published in scientific journals for the last 100 years. It seems to work in almost every animal studied—everything from tiny nematode worms and fruit flies to mice, rats, and even monkeys. It can extend the lifespan of rodents by between 15% and 60%, depending on which study you look at.

The effect of caloric restriction is more reliable than the leading contenders for an “anti-aging” drug. Both rapamycin (an immunosuppressive drug used in organ transplants) and metformin (a diabetes drug) have been touted as potential longevity therapeutics. And both have been found to increase the lifespans of animals in some studies.

But when scientists looked at 167 published studies of those three interventions in research animals, they found that caloric restriction was the most “robust.” According to their research, published in the journal Aging Cell on Wednesday, the effect of rapamycin was somewhat comparable, but metformin was nowhere near as effective.

“That is a pity for the many people now taking off-label metformin for lifespan extension,” David Clancy, lecturer in biogerontology at Lancaster University, said in a statement. “Let's hope it doesn't have any or many adverse effects.” Still, for caloric restriction, so far so good.

At least it's good news for lab animals. What about people? Also on Wednesday, another team of scientists published a separate review of research investigating the effects of caloric restriction and fasting on humans. That review assessed 99 clinical trials, involving over 6,500 adults. (As I said, caloric restriction has been an active area of research for a long time.)

This is really a question about how our bodies store and use the energy we need to function. 

Those researchers found that, across all those trials, fasting and caloric restriction did seem to aid weight loss. There were other benefits, too—but they depended on the specific approach to dieting. Fasting every other day seemed to help lower cholesterol, for example. Time-restricted eating, where you only eat within a specific period each day (à la Bryan Johnson), by comparison, seemed to increase cholesterol, the researchers write in the BMJ. Given that elevated cholesterol in the blood can lead to heart disease, it's not great news for the time-restricted eaters.

Cutting calories could also carry broader risks. Dietary restriction seems to impair wound healing in mice and rats, for example. Caloric restriction also seems to affect bone density. In some studies, the biggest effects on lifespan extension are seen when rats are put on calorie-restricted diets early in life. But this approach can affect bone development and reduce bone density by 9% to 30%.

It's also really hard for most people to cut their caloric intake. When researchers ran a two-year trial to measure the impact of a 25% reduction in caloric intake, they found that the most their volunteers could cut was 12%. (That study found that caloric restriction reduces markers of inflammation, which can be harmful when it's chronic, and had only a small impact on bone density.)

Unfortunately, there's a lot we still don't really understand about caloric restriction. It doesn't seem to help all animals live longer—it seems to shorten the lifespan of animals with certain genetic backgrounds. And we don't know whether it extends the lifespan of people. It isn't possible to conduct a randomized clinical trial in which you deprive people of food from childhood and then wait their entire lives to see when they die.

It is notoriously difficult to track or change your diet. And given the unknowns surrounding caloric restriction, it's too soon to make sweeping recommendations, particularly given that your own personal biology will play a role in any benefits or risks you'll experience. Roll on the next round of research.

A new review highlights the transformative potential of transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) in the field of liquid biopsy, emphasizing their role as promising biomarkers for a wide range of diseases, particularly cancers. These non-coding RNA fragments, originating from mature or precursor tRNAs, are detectable in diverse body fluids—including blood plasma, saliva, urine, semen, and cerebrospinal fluid—and exhibit remarkable stability, even in challenging biological environments.

The article presents tsRNAs as a rising star in precision medicine, with significant diagnostic and prognostic value. Found in both plasma and serum, tsRNAs offer disease-specific expression patterns and correlate with key clinical features such as tumor stage, metastasis, and patient survival. In breast cancer, certain circulating tsRNAs are associated with improved prognostic accuracy compared to traditional markers, while in lung cancer, tsRNA signatures have helped differentiate between early and advanced stages. tsRNAs have also shown promise in gastrointestinal, ovarian, pancreatic, renal, and bladder cancers, as well as in conditions like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, infertility, and neurodegenerative disorders.

A notable advantage of tsRNAs is their presence across multiple biofluids, enabling non-invasive sampling that is more accessible and less risky than tissue biopsies. This versatility opens up opportunities for early detection, disease monitoring, and treatment stratification. Importantly, tsRNAs demonstrate unique expression profiles distinct from similar small RNA classes like miRNAs, reinforcing their biological relevance and clinical utility.

The article also discusses challenges such as inconsistent nomenclature, variation in sample preparation, and the need for optimized detection platforms like PANDORA-seq. It calls for standardized analytical frameworks to enable consistent cross-study comparisons and emphasizes the importance of accounting for age-related and tissue-specific variation in tsRNA expression.

A new review published in Genes & Diseases explores the intricate epigenetic regulatory network of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), shedding light on the profound impact of DNA methylation, histone modifications, RNA methylation, and microRNAs on lncRNA transcription. This analysis highlights how these regulatory mechanisms drive the progression of liver cancer, offering valuable insights for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

The role of lncRNAs in cancer biology has become increasingly evident, as they regulate gene expression, chromatin remodeling, and cellular signaling pathways. In HCC, these molecules interact with epigenetic modifiers to influence tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. The review delves into how DNA methylation silences tumor-suppressing lncRNAs, while histone modifications either promote or inhibit their expression depending on the nature of methylation or acetylation. Additionally, RNA methylation—particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification—emerges as a crucial mechanism altering the stability and translation of these transcripts.

Beyond direct modifications, microRNAs (miRNAs) play a pivotal role in fine-tuning lncRNA expression through post-transcriptional regulation. The interplay between miRNAs and lncRNAs creates a complex competing endogenous RNA network, impacting key oncogenic and tumor-suppressive pathways in HCC.

Understanding these epigenetic interactions opens avenues for novel biomarkers that could revolutionize early detection, prognosis, and treatment approaches. The identification of epigenetically regulated lncRNAs paves the way for targeted therapies that modulate their function, potentially overcoming drug resistance and enhancing therapeutic efficacy.

This review offers a deeper comprehension of how lncRNA-driven epigenetic regulation contributes to HCC pathogenesis. These insights provide a foundation for developing innovative RNA-based therapies aimed at disrupting cancer-promoting networks while preserving essential cellular functions.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can be harvested from fat and bone marrow, have immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects that are beneficial for both human and veterinary medicine. However, MSCs have a limited proliferation capacity, with their quality varying depending on the donor's age and where they were harvested from. For this reason, a method for producing MSCs using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is attracting attention as a means to provide a stable supply of homogeneous MSCs. IPSCs have unlimited proliferation capacity and can be differentiated into various cell types. Despite this potential, there are only a limited number of studies focusing on dogs.

To improve canine medicine, a research team led by Professor Shingo Hatoya and Dr. Masaya Tsukamoto at Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Veterinary Science has successfully generated iPSCs from four different types of canine somatic cells. Using these cells, the optimal method for producing canine MSCs was investigated.

By applying a method used for producing human MSCs, the research team successfully produced quality canine MSCs with high proliferation capacity and expressed MSC markers. Furthermore, when comparing four types of iPS cell-derived MSCs, it was found that the highest quality MSCs were obtained from urine cells.

The establishment of a method for producing highly proliferative canine MSCs is expected to advance regenerative veterinary medicine."

Dr. Masaya Tsukamoto, Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Veterinary Science

Professor Hatoya concluded, "Going forward, we plan to conduct further verification of the immune regulatory and therapeutic effects of MSCs produced from canine iPS cells."

Scientists at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) and Nanjing University in China have developed a new drug delivery system that could improve how treatments of cancers and other diseases are delivered. Their study, published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, describes a new type of nanoparticle made by combining a widely used medical polymer with a natural blood protein. These particles can carry much larger amounts of disease-fighting drugs and remain stable much longer than current nanoparticle systems.

For years, biodegradable plastics such as PLGA have been used to create nanoparticles that release medicine into the body slowly. These delivery systems are especially useful for diseases like cancer, which often require steady, controlled doses of medication. However, many of the nanoparticles used today tend to clump together over time and usually carry only a small amount of a drug. This limits their effectiveness and can increase the chance of side effects caused by the materials used to carry the medicine.

"We managed to solve two big problems at once," says Dr. Gang Ruan, Senior Associate Professor at XJTLU Wisdom Lake Academy of Pharmacy and Director of Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory of Cell Therapy Nanoformulation (Construction), who led the research. "These new particles are made by mixing a medical-grade plastic called PLGA with albumin, a protein found in blood. Albumin already plays a role in carrying substances through the body and is used in some current cancer drugs. When mixed with PLGA in the lab, they naturally come together to form tiny, stable particles that are much better than using albumin or PLGA alone."

"One of the most exciting things is that these particles can hold up to 40% of the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin by weight," says Dr. Zixing Xu, who was a visiting PhD student at XJTLU from Nanjing University, and was a co-first author as well as co-corresponding author of the study. "That's a big improvement over some existing treatments, such as Doxil, which hold about 11%. Carrying more drug with less material could help reduce side effects for patients."

The team explored two ways of loading a drug onto the particles. In one approach, the drug was added during the formation of the particles. In the other, the drug seeped into already formed particles using natural concentration differences of both the drug and the solvent. They found that combining the two produced better results than using either method alone.

Tests in lab-grown cells and in animals showed that the new particles delivered drugs effectively while causing less damage to healthy tissues. Another major advantage was their long-term stability – the particles stayed intact for over six months, much longer than most current options. Preliminary studies of production scale-up indicate that these nanoparticles can be made at larger scale without losing quality.

The researchers plan to continue exploring how these nanoparticles can be adapted to carry other types of drugs, potentially offering a more versatile and reliable platform for treating cancer and other chronic diseases.

In patients with cirrhosis and acute fundal variceal bleeding, the use of preemptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (p-TIPS) with a covered stent within 72 hours of initial bleeding resulted in superior outcomes, with a higher probability of patients being free of death or rebleeding at 1 year than those using standard treatment.

"The results of the present study strongly support the use of p-TIPS in the management of acute gastric variceal bleeding and add an additional argument in favour of TIPS, which improves prognosis by effectively treating the haemodynamic disorders associated with cirrhosis," the authors of the study wrote. "In patients with cirrhosis and bleeding from fundal varices, p-TIPS with a covered stent is associated with markedly decreased death or rebleeding and should therefore be considered as a first-line therapy," they added.

This study was led by Jean-Paul Cervoni, MD, Service d'Hépatologie et de Soins Intensifs, CHU Besançon, Besançon, France. It was published online on June 12, 2025, in The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology.

A small sample size precluded definitive subgroup analyses (eg, variceal type). An overrepresentation of alcohol-related cirrhosis may have limited the applicability of the findings to other aetiologies. Eight patients in the p-TIPS group were treated beyond the 72-hour window.

This study was funded by the French Ministry of Health. Two authors reported receiving payment for lectures and one author reported receiving consulting fees from Gore.

The vascular system refers to all the blood vessels that run through the body. These vessels are in charge of moving oxygen throughout the body and removing waste products.

There are several modifiable risk factors that can help keep your vascular system healthy, including not smoking, staying at a healthy weight, exercising, eating right, and keeping your blood pressure and cholesterol levels down. 

If your vascular system is not functioning properly, it can increase your risk for vascular diseases such as aneurysm, peripheral artery disease, pulmonary embolism, and varicose veins. 

Additionally, vascular disease can increase your chances of developing other health issues, including heart attack and stroke, and can worsen kidney disease. 

Now, a new study recently published in the journal JAMA Neurology has found a link between certain midlife vascular risk factors — specifically high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking — and risk for dementia. 

Scientists report the attributable vascular risk factors were higher in both self-identified female and Black participants, as well as non-carriers of the apolipoprotein ε4 (APOE ε4) gene. 

For this study, researchers analyzed medical data from about 7,700 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, which ran from 1987-2020 with a 33-year follow-up. Participant risk factors were measured at ages 45-54, 55-64, and 65-74 years old. 

Researchers focused on three main vascular risk factors for this study: high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking. 

“There's been pretty consistent research for decades that indicates the importance of these three vascular risk factors in midlife (~ age 45-64 years) for elevating dementia risk, with less consensus on their associations in late-life (~ age ≥75 years),” Jason R. Smith, PhD, ScM, who was at the time of the study a researcher in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Maryland and first author of this study, told Medical News Today. 

“The prevalence of vascular risk factors also remains high in adults. So interventions for vascular factors beginning as early as midlife could potentially avert a big chunk of dementia risk,” he said.

Upon analysis, researchers found that between 22–44% of dementia cases reported by participants by age 80 were attributable to midlife and late-life vascular risk factors. 

“That 22-44% of population-level dementia risk by 80 years was attributed to at least one vascular risk factor from midlife through early late-life (ages 45-74 years) signals a major prevention gap,” Smith explained. “Clinical and public health interventions targeting vascular risk beginning as early as midlife could delay or prevent a sizable fraction of dementia risk by 80 years.”

“The burden of dementia remains high,” he continued. “It has a heterogeneous presentation and pathology, so targeting risk factors that are modifiable, more proximal to dementia expression (including hypertension, diabetes, and smoking), and that could potentially impact more than one underlying process giving rise to dementia, is paramount to reduce population-level dementia risk.”

Additionally, scientists found that the vascular risk factor attributable risk was highest in participants who self-identified as female or Black, as well as those not carrying the APOE ε4 gene.

“Caution's warranted when interpreting these stratified analyses, given wide (confidence intervals),” Smith said. “However, the analysis stratified by APOE carrier status suggests the absolute vascular contribution to dementia is larger among those at lower genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease.” 

“And that the vascular contribution was larger among those racialized as Black is likely due to a higher burden of vascular risk factors in this population,” he continued. “More inclusive and representative research is urgently needed to understand the prevention potential of vascular risk reduction in different populations.” 

“While this study is not designed to provide evidence on individual-level dementia risk reduction, promoting optimal vascular health as early as midlife could be vital for reducing population-level dementia risk by 80 years,” Smith added. “What's good for the heart is good for the brain, and the earlier prevention starts, the better.”

MNT spoke with Christopher Yi, MD, a board certified vascular surgeon at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. 

Yi commented that this study reinforces an increasingly clear message: vascular health is brain health. 

“My first reaction was that the findings were both striking and practical — nearly half of dementia cases by age 80 could be linked to modifiable vascular risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking,” he continued. “It's especially notable that late-life vascular health appeared even more strongly associated with dementia risk than midlife health, which challenges the idea that ‘it's too late' to make a difference after midlife.” 

Yi explained that vascular health affects dementia risk through several interconnected mechanisms.

“High blood pressure and vascular disease can damage the small vessels that supply the brain, leading to chronic ischemia (lack of oxygen) and brain tissue damage,” he detailed. “Silent strokes and microinfarcts are common in people with uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes and can accumulate over time, impairing cognitive function without obvious warning signs.” 

“Vascular risk factors promote inflammation and free radical damage, which contribute to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's pathology. (And) chronic vascular dysfunction can make the blood-brain barrier leaky, allowing harmful substances to enter the brain and accelerate neuronal damage.” — Christopher Yi, MD

For the next steps in this research, Yi said he would like to see more intervention trials, risk factor-specific analyses, mechanistic studies, and policy translation. 

“Explore how these findings could support more aggressive screening and treatment of vascular risks in primary care, with cognitive outcomes in mind,” he added.

The role of Fibroblast Growth Factor 8 (FGF8) in embryonic development and organ formation is gaining increased recognition as scientists uncover its wide-ranging influence. FGF8, a powerful signaling molecule, is essential for orchestrating the growth and differentiation of multiple tissues, including craniofacial structures, limbs, internal organs, and the brain. Any disruption in its function can lead to developmental disorders, highlighting its critical importance in normal growth processes.

During early organogenesis, FGF8 controls the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of stem cells, guiding the formation of key anatomical features. It plays a pivotal role in craniofacial development, ensuring the proper formation of the jaw, palate, and other skeletal structures. Abnormal FGF8 activity has been associated with skeletal malformations, including cleft palate and craniofacial syndromes.

FGF8 is also central to limb formation, directing patterning and segmentation to ensure normal growth of the arms and legs. Disruptions in its signaling pathway have been linked to limb malformations, such as split hand/foot malformation and limb asymmetry. Research further underscores its role in kidney development, where it regulates nephron formation and organ function, with defects potentially leading to renal abnormalities and congenital kidney disorders.

In cardiac development, FGF8 is required for the formation of the heart and great vessels, influencing processes such as outflow tract remodeling and valve formation. Dysregulation of FGF8 has been implicated in congenital heart defects, including persistent truncus arteriosus and outflow tract malformations, which can lead to severe cardiovascular conditions.

The nervous system is another area where FGF8 exerts profound effects. It governs the development of key brain structures, including the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, playing a crucial role in neuronal differentiation and connectivity. Variations in FGF8 expression have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Kallmann syndrome, holoprosencephaly, and CHARGE syndrome, which impact cognitive function, sensory processing, and neuroendocrine signaling.

With its far-reaching impact, FGF8 is a key focus in the field of developmental biology and regenerative medicine. Understanding its precise mechanisms could lead to targeted therapeutic strategies for treating congenital anomalies and tissue regeneration. As advancements in gene editing and molecular medicine continue to evolve, FGF8 remains a critical factor in unlocking the complexities of human growth and disease prevention.

Hepatitis B virus-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major global health burden, and new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches are urgently needed. Emerging research highlights the crucial role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in disease progression, offering promising avenues for early detection and innovative treatments. These non-coding RNA molecules, known for their stability and regulatory functions, are proving to be pivotal in tumor biology and immune response modulation.

Unlike linear RNAs, circRNAs have a closed-loop structure that makes them resistant to degradation, allowing them to serve as long-lasting regulators of gene expression. They influence multiple cancer-related processes, including tumor proliferation, metastasis, immune evasion, and drug resistance. Specific circRNAs such as circRNA-100338, circRNA-101764, and circBACH1 have been identified as key players in HCC progression, affecting crucial signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB. By acting as molecular sponges for microRNAs (miRNAs), these circRNAs help modulate cancer-promoting genes, making them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.

The potential of circRNAs extends beyond treatment to early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation. Blood-based biomarkers, including circRNA panels, have demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity in distinguishing HCC from chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis, outperforming traditional markers like alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). With liquid biopsy techniques gaining traction, circRNAs could revolutionize non-invasive cancer detection, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes.

Targeting circRNAs for therapy is an exciting frontier in RNA-based medicine. Cutting-edge approaches, including RNA interference (RNAi), CRISPR-based gene editing, and nanoparticle delivery systems, are being explored to selectively suppress tumor-promoting circRNAs or restore tumor-suppressive ones. Additionally, circRNA-based vaccines are under development, leveraging their ability to encode therapeutic proteins while avoiding rapid degradation.

Advancements in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics are accelerating circRNA research, providing deeper insights into their functional mechanisms in liver cancer. However, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinical applications, including the need for precise delivery systems, validation in large-scale studies, and better understanding of circRNA interactions with host immune pathways.

Published (DOI: 10.1136/wjps-2025-001026) on May 12, 2025, in World Journal of Pediatric Surgery, researchers from Geneva University Hospitals conducted the first scoping review of BA screening efforts across Europe. Their findings reveal a patchwork landscape: while countries like Switzerland, France, and Germany have introduced national SCC programs, most others lag behind or rely solely on localized pilots. This review highlights both systemic inertia and promising technologies—such as AI-enabled apps—that could bridge the gap in diagnosis and care, advocating for Europe to rethink and revitalize its approach to neonatal liver screening.

This review assessed a wide range of data—from published literatures to digital health tools—on three major screening strategies: SCC, serum bilirubin testing, and biochemical profiling. Switzerland was the first country in Europe to launch a national SCC program, reducing the median age of surgery and eventually integrating the card into newborn health booklets. France followed through a parent-led advocacy campaign, while Germany only recently mandated SCC use nationwide. Elsewhere, efforts remain sporadic.

Studies consistently show SCC's effectiveness improves dramatically when accompanied by clear referral guidance. Yet many pediatricians still resist its use, citing workload and psychological concerns. Meanwhile, the UK has led research on bilirubin screening, showing exceptional accuracy—but has failed to move from research to policy due to logistical and financial barriers. Recent breakthroughs such as Italy's PopòApp and Germany's AI-powered stool image analysis show strong potential for improving accuracy and scalability. Together, these insights suggest that Europe has both the tools and the knowledge—but not yet the will—to implement widespread BA screening.

Europe has no shortage of expertise, evidence, or technology—what's missing is coordinated action. We've seen how something as simple as a color card can shift outcomes dramatically. Add digital tools and clinical buy-in, and we could revolutionize early diagnosis for thousands of infants. But time is of the essence—each delay costs lives."

Professor Barbara E. Wildhaber, senior author of the study

A unified European strategy could turn the tide against BA-related infant mortality. Combining SCC with digital apps and AI can provide low-cost, high-reach solutions for families and frontline clinicians. Serum bilirubin testing, though more expensive, captures a wider spectrum of liver diseases and could complement SCC-based programs. Countries may benefit most from hybrid screening models tailored to their healthcare infrastructure. Crucially, any technical rollout must be paired with education, awareness, and strong political advocacy. With the right alignment of tools, policy, and public will, Europe can catch up—and catch the infants who need help most.

According to a recent study conducted at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland, body composition is associated with symptoms of pelvic floor disorders in middle-aged women. Larger fat mass increases the risk for stress urinary incontinence. The risk factors include larger fat mass especially on the waist area and around visceral organs as well as larger waist circumference and body mass index.

The prevalence of pelvic floor disorders increases as women approach their menopausal years. Estrogen deprivation, natural aging of tissues, reproductive history, and factors increasing intra-abdominal pressure may lead to structural and functional failure in the pelvic floor.

In addition, lifestyle choices such as eating behaviour and physical activity may have an effect on the mechanisms of pelvic floor disorders. Body composition partly reflects lifestyle choices and can therefore be considered a modifiable factor that reveals a woman's risk for experiencing symptoms of pelvic floor disorders.

Previous studies have mainly utilised body mass index or waist circumference when evaluating the risk for pelvic floor disorders. The purpose of our study was to explain how the body composition - which was measured using precise methods - is associated with the symptoms during the four-year follow-up."

Doctoral Researcher Mari Kuutti from the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, University of Jyväskylä

The disorders studied were stress urinary incontinence, urgency urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse.

Over half of the women had symptoms of pelvic floor disorders

At the baseline, over half of the participating women had some type of symptoms of pelvic floor disorder. The most common were the symptoms of stress urinary incontinence. The study showed that body composition is associated with the presence of the symptoms of pelvic floor disorders.

"We studied body adiposity, measured waist circumferences of the participants, and calculated body mass index," Kuutti says. "Then we analyzed the associations of these factors with the symptoms of pelvic floor disorders."

The results showed that total fat mass, android fat mass, gynoid fat mass, and trunk fat mass as well as visceral fat area were associated with the symptoms of stress urinary incontinence. Similarly, larger body mass index and waist circumference were associated with the symptoms of stress urinary incontinence.

Changes in body composition during the four-year follow-up were not associated with changes in the symptoms of pelvic floor disorders.

"The association of body composition with the symptoms of pelvic floor disorders was found in cross-sectional analysis. In other words, we showed that the present body composition is associated with the present symptoms."

The study is part of the larger ERMA study and its four-year follow up study EsmiRs. The participants included 376 women living in the Jyväskylä region. They were from 47 to 55 years old at the baseline. Body composition was measured with multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer, X-ray absorptiometry, and antropometry. Demographical factors (age, education, physical workload and physical activity) and gynecological factors (gestations, parity, menopausal status, and hysterectomy status) were self-reported with questionnaires.

A new study of over 13 million people in England has found no evidence to suggest mild COVID-19 infection may cause long-term kidney damage. However, patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infections are at a high risk of long-term kidney damage, the analysis suggests.

Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, severe infections requiring hospitalisation were often accompanied by a decline in kidney function. While research studies continue to support this association, until now it has remained unclear whether milder COVID-19 infections, which do not require treatment in hospital, may also affect kidney function long-term.

The new study, led by researchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) as part of the OpenSAFELY collaboration with the University of Oxford, analyzed electronic health data from over 13 million GP and hospital records in England between 1 February 2020 and 31 December 2022.

The OpenSAFELY platform acts as a gateway between electronic patient records and important medical research. Developed over the COVID-19 pandemic, the platform allows information from GP records to be anonymised, grouped with other sources of data such as hospital records, and used in scientific studies, without researchers having direct access to the records or identifiable information. 

Of the data analysed in the study, over 3.5 million people were recorded as having had a COVID-19 infection and 10 million people did not have a record of infection. Records from people who were already on dialysis, a treatment used to filter blood when a patient's kidneys are unable to do so, or living with a kidney transplant, were excluded from the sample.

The findings are published in The Lancet Regional Health Europe.

Across the study period, people who needed hospitalisation for COVID-19 had over seven times greater risk of kidney failure than people without COVID-19. These risks were highest amongst those who required intensive care and in those recorded as having acute kidney injury during their illness. Amongst people with COVID-19 which was not severe enough to require hospitalisation, there was no increased risk of kidney failure.

Dr. Viyaasan Mahalingasivam, a research fellow at LSHTM and a specialist kidney doctor at Barts Health NHS Trust, and lead author of the study, said: "Our study is the largest of its kind to look at the long-term effects of COVID-19 infections on our kidneys. During the heights of the pandemic, we were overwhelmed by the volume of patients who were sick with COVID-19 who needed dialysis for severe kidney injury. Because of this, there were concerns that milder COVID-19 illness might lead to more gradual kidney damage over the longer term.

"It's reassuring that we did not find evidence to suggest that mild COVID-19 infection causes long-term damage to kidney function. But we can't ignore that those who experience severe illness with COVID-19 and end up in hospital, do have a high risk of kidney failure or worsening kidney function.

"Our work builds on previous studies which have suggested that kidney complications may be a bigger problem after COVID-19 than other types of infection. However, we're not able to say whether the main mechanism behind this is the COVID-19 virus attacking the kidney directly or if it is a consequence of the body's inflammatory response to severe infection."

The study also found that the increased risk of kidney damage for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infections differed across ethnicities and was highest for black ethnic groups.

Our results show that having a mild COVID-19 infection does not increase your risk of getting long-term kidney damage, and that is particularly reassuring for patients who are already living with kidney disease. However, there were still a substantial number of people who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19 infections, who then went on to develop kidney failure and it's important that we try to establish how we can minimize this in future.

Our findings all add to growing calls for more studies into health inequalities and what could be driving them, such as delayed access to treatment, differing susceptibility to infections and broader structural and social determinants of health."

Dr. Laurie Tomlinson, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at LSHTM and senior author of the study

The authors say that healthcare providers should prioritise interventions which minimise the chances of at-risk groups needing hospitalization. This includes ensuring vaccinations can be accessed by patients who are most vulnerable to severe illness. They say that patients discharged from hospital after being treated for COVID-19 infection should also be carefully monitored.

The research was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research.

Altum Sequencing, a start-up supported by the C3N-IA Science Park at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) and specialized in oncology, has developed a tool to monitor treatment response in patients with solid tumors from a simple blood sample. This advance could represent a turning point in post-treatment follow-up.

The study detailing the effectiveness of this system, recently published in the journal Breast Cancer Research, explains that although many patients with HR+ breast cancer (the most common subtype among women) initially respond well to therapy, up to 40% of them relapse over time. However, through the technology developed and the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (a type of tumor-derived DNA that can spread to the blood), the researchers have been able to anticipate the onset of clinical relapses up to 68 months before symptoms detectable by traditional methods become apparent.

Our goal is not to diagnose cancer, but to provide physicians with an effective tool to monitor the evolution of the disease after treatment. Current diagnostic tools have sensitivity limitations, which makes early detection of these relapses difficult, but thanks to NGS (next generation sequencing) DNA sequencing technology, we can detect one tumor cell among a million healthy cells from a simple blood sample." 

Joaquín Martínez-López, President of Altum Sequencing

The methodology used to detect relapses so early begins with an initial tumor biopsy. Next, patient-specific mutations are identified. This is followed up by blood tests looking for traces of these mutations in circulating tumor DNA.

"The advantage of our technology is that it is very minimally invasive, versatile and tailored to each tumor type. In addition, the cost is significantly reduced by focusing only on mutations relevant to each patient. This also allows us to avoid unnecessary treatments and minimizes the risk of false positives," adds Marina Planas, CEO of Altum Sequencing.

The potential of this innovation goes beyond breast cancer, as the technology is applicable to any type of solid tumor. The researchers are therefore working to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in both Europe and the United States with the aim of making this tool available in hospitals around the world. "We started with haematological cancers such as multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukaemia, but we are already seeing good results in lung cancers as well, so our goal is to transform cancer monitoring. Today, we can detect one cell in a million. In the future, it will be one in ten million," concludes the CEO.

The company plans to advance the integration of emerging technologies with the implementation of generative artificial intelligence throughout this year. After incorporating machine learning algorithms into its processes, its goal now is to use this new technology to improve diagnostic accuracy, optimize the adaptation of treatments and provide more useful and personalized information to patients.

Altum Sequencing has been supported by the Centre for Innovation in Entrepreneurship and Artificial Intelligence (C3N-IA) at the UC3M Science Park, located in the Leganés Tecnológico Science, Technology and Business Park. It has also received support from the Community of Madrid, the Centre for Technological Development and Innovation (CDTI) and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER, for its acronym in Spanish). The company also collaborates with the 12 de Octubre Hospital, the Gregorio Marañón Hospital, HM hospitals, the Hospital Regional de Málaga, and other research centres such as the CNIO, Universidad Complutense and IBIMA, which have coordinated the study from Málaga, thanks to its principal investigator, Iñaki Comino.

New research suggests that taking a daily aspirin may halve your risk of developing diabetes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, by targeting inflammation, but not without trade-offs.

In a recent study published in the journal npj Metabolic Health and Disease, a group of researchers assessed whether daily low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

T2D affects over 500 million people globally, and its incidence sharply increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several factors, including stress, poor dietary habits, reduced physical activity, and limited access to healthcare, may have contributed to this rise in cases.

Experimental research suggests that inflammation plays a key role in disrupting insulin function, prompting interest in anti-inflammatory treatments for prevention. Aspirin has anti-inflammatory effects that may help regulate blood sugar levels, in addition to its cardiovascular benefits. However, most of the findings so far come from controlled trials in older adults, and to understand how aspirin affects T2D in everyday life, further research is needed.

Aspirin's dual anti-inflammatory pathways. Low-dose aspirin blocks prostacyclin production and triggers anti-adhesive nitric oxide release, while high doses inhibit the NF-κB cascade – both mechanisms potentially disrupting diabetes development.

The present longitudinal cohort study was conducted using electronic health records from Cooperative of General Practitioners (COMEGEN)- a healthcare network under the Italian Ministry of Health operating in Naples. The COMEGEN database contains clinical information on over 200,000 adults. Researchers collected data from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022, among adults aged 18 years and older. Adults were eligible if they had neither a previous diagnosis of T2D, chronic kidney disease, or cardiovascular events, nor used aspirin before 2018.

The primary exposure was initiation of daily low-dose aspirin therapy (100 mg), and the primary outcome was a new diagnosis of T2D, confirmed by diagnostic codes and prescriptions. Researchers confirmed COVID-19 infections using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test data from the Campania Region's official registry.

To ensure accurate comparisons between aspirin users and non-users, the researchers matched participants based on factors such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), prediabetes status, and use of blood pressure or lipid-lowering medications. They used Cox regression to track the time until new diabetes cases appeared and plotted overall risk trends with Kaplan-Meier curves. Bleeding events were monitored throughout the study and classified as major, moderate, or minor.

The study design also allowed for the reliable capture of lesser-severity bleeding episodes, which are often missed in clinical trials but can significantly impact patients. All results were considered statistically significant if p-values were less than 0.05, and the analysis was performed using R software (version 4.4.0).

Older, higher-risk participants dominated the cohort. Before matching, aspirin users averaged 76 years with 40% prediabetes and 74% statin use, highlighting a population already facing metabolic challenges.

Out of 247,975 eligible individuals in the COMEGEN database, 35,525 met inclusion criteria. After applying 1:1 propensity score matching, 4,139 individuals who received low-dose aspirin were compared with an equal number of matched non-users. The matched groups were similar in age, gender, BMI, and baseline comorbidities, ensuring reliable comparisons.

Over the observation period, 999 new cases of T2D were reported. Among aspirin users, the incidence rate was 15.9 per 1,000 person-years, while in the control group, it was 32 per 1,000 person-years. Cox regression analysis revealed that aspirin therapy was associated with a 52% reduction in the risk of T2D (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42--0.45; p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed that the divergence in T2D risk became significant after the second year of aspirin use and continued to widen over time.

When the data were split into pre-pandemic and COVID-19 pandemic periods, the protective effect remained strong. Prior to COVID-19, aspirin users had a 29% reduced risk of developing T2D (HR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.56-0.89). During the COVID-19 period, the risk reduction increased to 62% (HR = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.32-0.35). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed an earlier and more pronounced separation of risk curves during the pandemic, suggesting that aspirin's anti-inflammatory properties had increased relevance amid COVID-19-related immune activation.

The safety analysis included 8,278 participants equally divided between aspirin users and non-users. Major bleeding events occurred in 0.3% of aspirin users, compared to 0.1% in the control group. Moderate bleeding rates were 8.3 vs 4.2 events per 1,000 person-years, and minor bleeding, including hematuria, was slightly more common in the aspirin group (6.7 vs 4.9 per 1,000 person-years). While aspirin did raise bleeding risks, the rates were consistent with prior studies, and most events were not life-threatening.

These findings suggest that low-dose aspirin significantly reduces the risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This effect highlights the inflammatory basis of diabetes pathogenesis in the context of viral infection, supporting further exploration of targeted anti-inflammatory strategies in high-risk populations.

Controversy around pancreatic ACE2 receptors. The paper notes conflicting evidence on whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infects human insulin-producing cells, suggesting inflammation may drive diabetes independently of viral invasion.

To summarize, this real-world cohort study using COMEGEN data demonstrates that daily low-dose aspirin significantly reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results strengthen the hypothesis that inflammation is a key driver of COVID-19-related metabolic disturbances and demonstrate aspirin's potential in reducing this risk. However, the associated increase in bleeding events warrants caution and individualized risk-benefit evaluation.

While the study is robust, the authors acknowledge limitations, including the lack of data on inflammatory markers, lifestyle changes, and COVID-19 vaccination status. These findings should not lead to the widespread use of aspirin for diabetes prevention, but rather suggest promising therapeutic directions.

In a recent article published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, researchers analyzed whether higher levels of marine microplastics in ocean water near US coastlines are linked to greater county-level prevalence of stroke, coronary artery disease, or type 2 diabetes.

After adjusting for local vulnerabilities and demographic factors, coastal counties with very high levels of microplastics had significantly higher prevalences of all three conditions than those with low levels.

Plastics have become deeply embedded in modern life due to their affordability and versatility; however, their widespread use has also led to severe environmental pollution. Disposed plastic waste often breaks down into tiny particles called microplastics and nanoplastics through the process of weathering and degradation.

While the environmental impacts of plastic pollution are well-documented, its direct effects on human health are still being explored. Concerns have grown over the health risks associated with chemicals in plastics, such as phthalates and bisphenol A, which are known to disrupt hormone function and cause other health issues.

More recently, micro- and nanoplastics have been shown to cause cell damage by inducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and even cell death. Early studies suggest that high levels of these tiny plastic particles may lead to changes in blood vessels and the heart, including damage to blood vessel linings, reduced heart function, and abnormal blood flow, which can contribute to heart disease and related conditions.

Additionally, microplastics have been found in artery plaques, raising the possibility that they increase the risk of cardiovascular problems. However, it remains unclear how these findings affect entire populations.

This study was designed to fill an important research gap by assessing the relationship between ocean microplastic pollution near US coastlines and local rates of major cardiometabolic diseases.

To investigate this link, the researchers utilized ocean microplastic concentration data spanning the years 2015 to 2020. They mapped microplastic levels within 200 nautical miles of the US coastline, aligning with the United Nations' definition of exclusive economic zones where coastal nations manage ocean resources.

They identified 152 US counties bordering these coastal waters and calculated the average microplastic levels for each of these areas. Counties were then grouped into four categories: low, medium, high, or very high microplastic levels and linked to county-level estimates for stroke, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes from 2019 to 2020.

To account for other factors influencing health, they included demographic details such as sex and age, physician availability, and broader social, environmental, and infrastructure vulnerabilities, using tools like the Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI).

Statistical analysis involved quasi-Poisson regression, which is suited for data with overdispersion and non-normal distributions. Population weights were applied to ensure that counties with larger populations had appropriate influence.

Counties bordering ocean waters with very high microplastic concentrations had significantly greater average rates of stroke, coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes compared to counties with low microplastic levels.

Specifically, the mean prevalence of diabetes was about 13% in areas with very high microplastic levels, compared to 11.2% in areas with low levels. Likewise, stroke and coronary heart disease were also more common where microplastic pollution was greatest.

Statistical models confirmed this trend even after adjusting for key factors like sex, age, ethnic and racial composition, healthcare access, and environmental and socioeconomic vulnerabilities. In the fully adjusted models, very high microplastic levels were associated with a 5% to 6% higher prevalence of diabetes and artery disease, and about a 4% increase for stroke compared to low-level areas (with the finding for stroke being on the margin of statistical significance).

Regional patterns also emerged. The prevalence of all three diseases was highest in counties along the Gulf of Mexico, while the highest microplastic concentrations were measured off the Atlantic coast, both in contrast to the Pacific coast, which had lower disease rates and microplastic levels.

This ecological study provides population-level evidence that higher marine microplastic pollution may be associated with a greater burden of cardiometabolic diseases in US coastal regions.

Proposed pathways include contamination of seafood and groundwater, which supplies about 35% of U.S. drinking water, as well as possible inhalation or skin contact near polluted shores. Experimental studies and animal models back the plausibility of microplastics causing vascular damage, inflammation, and metabolic disruption.

However, limitations exist: the analysis is ecological and cross-sectional, so individual cause-and-effect relationships cannot be confirmed. There was also no direct measurement of human microplastic exposure or detailed analysis of different plastic types. Population movement, other confounding factors, and variations in local pollution controls could have influenced results.

Despite these gaps, the study highlights a concerning environmental health risk and underscores the need for further research to establish clear exposure thresholds and elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. Policymakers should consider stronger regulations to curb plastic pollution and protect communities that rely on seafood and coastal waters.

Flamengo fought back to beat Premier League side Chelsea 3-1 in a thrilling Club World Cup 2025 clash.

Chelsea opened the scoring through an early Pedro Neto goal and appeared to be cruising to victory.

But the Premier League side completely capitulated during a disastrous second half, with Bruno Henrique and Danilo striking for Flamengo within four minutes to turn the game around.

Nicolas Jackson was then sent off for Chelsea two minutes later before second-half substitute Wallace Yan added insult to injury by adding Flamengo's third.

Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca also chatted to DAZN's Anita Jones after the match, admitting Flamengo were the better team and that the red card was a turning point.

He said: “Completely changed the game, unfortunately. It's very complicated to come back in the game. We tried, but congratulations to them.”

When asked whether he has spoken to Nicolas Jackson after his sending off, Maresca added: “No. It was a red card, so nothing to say.

“Congratulations to them, they deserved to win, we tried to do something different, for next season.” Fair to say it didn't work? “No, I wouldn't say that. We tried something different.”

Interesting!

Chelsea conceded three goals today for the first time since losing 3-0 against Brighton in the Premier League on February 14. 

It is their third time conceding three or more goals this year (also allowed three at Manchester City on January 25).

Also, Flamengo's Gonzalo Plata registered two assists today. The last time he had two or more goal contributions in a match was November 14, 2024 with Ecuador against Bolivia in World Cup qualifying.

Bruno Henrique's two goal contributions (goal and assist) marked his first appearance with two or more since February 2.

Goalscorer and Flamengo veteran Danilo also chatted to DAZN post-match and he underlined their work rate as a key reason for winning.

He said: “First of all, really proud of the Brazilian teams at this tournament.

“We've been working really hard these last few weeks and we're showing on the pitch the work that has been.

“(The manager told us) To keep calm, to keep playing. We kept our minds focused on what we have to do and the result came to our side.”

OK, that was an awful challenge from Nicolas Jackson (not a happy birthday), but Chelsea had also lost control of the game before going down to ten men.

Jorginho admitted his side believed they could win even despite being one down at the break.

He said to Anita Nneka Jones on DAZN: “We were really confident and we know in these big games, details make the difference. 

“Overall, we were really good in the first half so we were really confident.

“We felt confident because we were playing good football and we needed to keep going the way we were.”

Another former Chelsea player has spoken to the media...

Nicolas Jackson was sent off for an awful studs-up tackle three minutes after coming on as a substitute as Chelsea imploded in six minutes of madness to lose 3-1 against Flamengo at the Club World Cup.

Flamengo are now in control of group D, with all of Brazil's teams unbeaten at the tournament and Chelsea in a fight to qualify for the last 16.

Below, The Athletic's Liam Twomey, Stuart James, and Larry Henry Jr break down the key talking points.

Flamengo 3 Chelsea 1 – Jackson sent off as Maresca's team implode at Club World Cup

Victorious manager Filipe Luis spoke to DAZN after the match and he hailed his team's performance.

He said: “I'm really happy for the game. We believed since the beginning we would have chances against them. I'm really proud. 

“After Wesley's mistake, we didn't stop playing, kept going the same way we always play. My heart is warm right now because of this.

“Bruno (Henrique) is special. He is the player with the most titles in club history. One minute, five, 90, he always gives his heart. I'm really happy for him. And Danilo is huge. You have to enjoy these players.”

Striking a pose!

Is there anything better than watching your side, the underdogs, beating a more illustrious team?

Looks a hell of an atmosphere in that Flamengo end at the Lincoln Financial Field!

Bruno Henrique, all of 34 years old.

He sunk to his knees at the final whistle, and no wonder.

A herculean effort to turn the game in his side's favour after coming off the bench.

They were only ‘supposed to' get the tifo (fan banner) out at the start of the game.

But you can't really begrudge them another whirl of their club colours given the result, can you?!

Flamengo's comeback win is their first in all competitions since March 8 (a 2-1 win against Vasco da Gama in the Taça Guanabara semifinals). 

They advanced to the final of that competition due to that result, eventually defeating Fluminense 2-1 on aggregate to win the tournament.

That's it!

Flamengo have bloodied the nose of Chelsea!

They went behind and have turned it around brilliantly with a backs-to-the-wall performance full of heart, guts, and grit.

Yes, Chelsea imploded in six minutes with two quick goals conceded and Nicolas Jackson's red card.

But Flamengo deserve that. What a win!

90+7' Flamengo 3-1 Chelsea

And yet, Chelsea are passing it around with little urgency.

Bizarre.

As against Newcastle, Chelsea have done pretty well to exert pressure on a nervy Flamengo with 10 men, but just as it was at St James' Park, it is too little, too late.

90+5' Flamengo 3-1 Chelsea

Ayrton Lucas, the left-back and Brazil international, defends well, twice in a matter of seconds.

First, he sprints back to slide in on Noni Madueke, who tested him for pace down the line.

Then Caicedo passed it through nicely to Gusto down the right, and he stopped the attack again.

90+1' Flamengo 3-1 Chelsea

Into the first minute of seven added on, Flamengo make another two swaps.

Gonzalo Plata is booked as he goes off for time-wasting, I think, and he jogs off with Luiz Araujo. On are attackers Pedro, the dangerous No 9, and Michael.

I love when Brazilian footballers have English-style single names. What next? 21-year-old No 10 Keith? Skilful left-back Clive?

Not long for Enzo Maresca's side to find two goals, down a man too.

90' Flamengo 3-1 Chelsea

Another foul from Pulgar on Caicedo just outside the box, albeit a challenge he was always trying to pull out of, hence no second yellow.

Neto over it, better strike, and the ball deflects to Marc Guiu at the back post.

He is well placed, the Spanish sub, and shoots from a tight angle, but it's well blocked by goalkeeper Agustin Rossi who is swiftly off his line!

He pumps his fist in delight.

In the end, Madueke balloons it miles over the bar. What a waste.

CONMEBOL absolutely planting their flag at this Club World Cup. 

Believe me, there's a heated rivalry between UEFA and the South American confederation, certainly at the club level. 

This tournament was always going to be an opportunity for the South Americans to deliver a decisive blow on their European counterparts.

86' Flamengo 3-1 Chelsea

That will probably be that! And again, it's an inspired substitution from Flamengo manager Filipe Luis, who once wore the colours of Chelsea and knows the club so well.

He brought on Bruno Henrique in the 56th minute, and within 10 minutes he had a goal and an assist as Flamengo led.

Then he brought on Wallace Yan, the promising 20-year-old forward, in the 82nd. In the 83rd, he had found the net to make it 3-1.

A nice run from Gonzalo Plata, who has looked better since moving to a more natural position on the right wing, cutting inside.

He shot between two defenders, and it hit Yan, who was trying to get out of the way. Sanchez was committed to the dive and was on the floor, so it was easy for Yan to readjust and steer it home.

He was onside. Fortuitous? Definitely. But so was Chelsea's opener. And Flamengo won't care a jot!

84' Flamengo 3-1 Chelsea

Flamengo fans are delirious with delight!

Wallace Yan scores moments after coming off the bench!

82' Flamengo 2-1 Chelsea

Flamengo take off the lively Gerson and right-back Wesley Franca for Wallace Yan and Guillermo Varela, once of Manchester United, respectively.

Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca makes a double change too, with Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez hooked for Marc Guiu and Noni Madueke.

And...

81' Flamengo 2-1 Chelsea

From a free kick on the right, Enzo Fernandez latches onto it, but can only direct his header over the bar.

Presentable opportunity...

79' Flamengo 2-1 Chelsea

Flamengo of Rio de Janeiro leading the London side at the moment. Can they hold on?

There's a pause in play, with the impressive Wesley Franca down.

That came shortly after Gerson was booked for leaving a foot in on Marc Cucurella.

Flamengo fans are loving it. 

Flags, shirts and scarves waving and red smoke drifting across the noisiest corner of Lincoln Financial Field that you can smell high up in the press box.

Couldn't agree more with Felipe: a damning blunder. 

It's even worse considering Jackson had been in fine form entering today, having scored in three straight: the Conference League final, Senegal's friendly against England, and the group opener against Los Angeles FC.

His substitute's shift lasted just three minutes, logging just a single touch, before being sent off today. 

Liam Delap should enjoy even more time to settle into Enzo Maresca's team during Jackson's impending absence.

Jackson has done it again. A little more than a month after a wild elbow to the head of Sven Botman ended his Premier League season against Newcastle, he decides to go in studs up on Ayrton Lucas. 

An incomprehensible decision that, coming so soon after two Flamengo goals, has likely condemned Chelsea to defeat.

Nicolas Jackson with the mental blunder of the tournament so far. 

A grotesque challenge and an obvious straight red card.

That was Nicolas Jackson's second red card in the last 40 days.

That's a ludicrous challenge from Jackson. 

It looked bad at first viewing. It looks ever worse on the replay.

Chelsea has capped as bad of a six-minute stretch any team can have. 

From 1-0 up to down 2-1 and down a man. 

Flamengo has full control over this game now, and Chelsea has to get clever to regain a point.

Wow. This is mad. 

Chelsea looked pretty comfortable for most of the first half but have now conceded twice ... and just had sub Nicolas Jackson sent off.

Seattle Reign FC has five players called up to the United States Under-23 Women's National Team training camp in Commerce City, Colorado from June 23-July 2 – Emeri Adames, Maddie Dahlien, Emily Mason, Sally Menti and Maddie Prohaska.

As part of the 24-player roster, the five players will attend cap from June 23-June 26, which will run concurrently with the United States Women's National Team, allowing Head coach Emma Hayes and her staff to observe training. The team will then attend the USWNT vs. Ireland match on June 26 at DICK'S Sporting Good Park before completing camp in Denver while the USWNT departs to finish its slate of matches.

"The U-23 level is such a critical part of the pipeline, and to have five of our players called in shows that we're developing not just professionals, but future leaders for the national team. These players are stepping into their prime and we're proud to be part of that journey,” said Reign FC General Manager Lesle Gallimore.

Most recently, the U.S. U-23s played a pair of friendly matches in Germany, picking up one 2-1 win and one 2-1 loss. Mason and Dahlien were two of nine players included in the June-July camp that were called up for the Germany trip. Adames, Dahlien and Menti make up one third of the NWSL players on the roster that have scored a goal this season.

Adames has been a consistent performer for the Reign in 2025, making nine appearances and scoring two goals. The forward is no stranger to international action, as she's racked up an impressive resume of experience across various youth national teams. Recently, she was part of the U.S. team that took third at the 2024 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.

Dahlien, another key part of the Reign's attack, has two goals and an assist in her 12 games for Seattle. Like Adames, she was a part of the U.S. squad that took third at the 2024 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.

Mason has played in seven matches for the Reign this season. She attended the 2025 USWNT Futures Camp earlier this year and competed in the 2022 FIFA U-20 World Cup. She was named to the Concacaf U-20 Championship Best XI for her efforts as she helped record seven straight shutouts during their run to the title.

Menti recently made her Reign FC debut and captured her first goal in the following match. The Seattle local started all three group games for the USA at the 2022 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in Costa Rica, tallying an assist against Ghana. She also helped the U-20 WYNT win the 2022 Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship and was a nominee for the 2022 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year.

Prohaska, who signed with the Reign in March after joining preseason as a trialist, has not yet made her NWSL debut. The Auburn standout has previously been called into Youth National Team camp.

Morris earns her fourth call-up of 2025 to the U-23 team 

Washington, D.C. (06/20/2025) – Washington Spirit forward Makenna Morris has been called up to the United States U-23 Women's National Team, U.S. Soccer announced today. The U-23 team will hold its upcoming training camp in Commerce City, Colorado from June 23 through July 2. The first four days of camp will run concurrently with the senior team's camp. 

This represents Morris' fourth call-up of 2025 to the U-23 squad. The Spirit's standout sophomore joined the team for January's Futures Camp, training with the senior team's staff, as well as the April and May/June training camps. So far in 2025, Morris has appeared in all 12 regular season matches for the Spirit, totaling over 750 minutes of playing time across both the back line and attacking third. The dynamic second-year pro also scored Washington's first goal of the season in Houston this spring, the sixth of her young career. 

Fans' next chance to see their favorite Spirit players in action will be at the team's Open Training event next month. Taking place on Saturday, July 19 at George Mason University, fans are invited to come out and watch as the team gears up for the second half of the season. Limited tickets are available here. The Spirit will take the pitch at home again on Sunday, August 3 following the NWSL's July break. Facing off against Portland Thorns FC, the Spirit will host its first-ever Throwback Day at Audi Field. Single match tickets are available here.

Borussia Dortmund striker Serhou Guirassy admits he is looking forward to his first true taste of United States football culture at the Club World Cup.

Dortmund are one of two sides flying the flag for the Bundesliga, alongside champions Bayern Munich, and still have to play Mamelodi Sundowns and Ulsan in a group stage which takes them from East Rutherford, New Jersey to Cincinnati, Ohio—their opening game with former Copa Libertadores winners Fluminense finished 0–0.

The new format of this competition means there remains plenty of unknowns heading into the Club World Cup, but for Guirassy, one thing is for certain—the United States is set to put on a memorable show for everyone involved.

“It's a World Cup,” he tells Sports Illustrated. “It's true, it's different from the Nations Cup, but it's still a World Cup. I think all the teams that go there are there to win. And you're playing in a World Cup, so you go there to win it. 

“Plus, in the United States, we know it's like a football country. Especially now with [Lionel] Messi joining Inter Miami. So now they're even more focused on football, I'd say. So it's going to be a great competition.”

This will not be Guirassy's first trip to the United States but, by his own admission, he has never before had the opportunity to immerse himself in a culture which continues to grow with each passing week.

“It's good because it's... it's a discovery,” he continues. “I've been to the United States, but it was... it was really in flash mode, I would say. 

“It feels good. You play football, you discover other countries, other cities, so it's very interesting.“

DALLAS — Former Dallas Trinity FC midfielder Samantha Meza has been called up to the United States women's national team (USWNT) for June and July friendly matches, the team announced this week.

The call-up marks Meza's first time reporting for the USWNT senior roster, and the first Dallas Trinity FC current or former player to be called into camp. Meza is one of six midfielders on the roster in this training window. Meza, a Dallas native, was drafted by the Seattle Reign in the 2024 NWSL Draft, but played for Dallas Trinity FC on loan in the first half of the inaugural USL Super League season.

Meza returned to Seattle and made her NWSL debut on March 15 against against Gotham FC, coming on as a stoppage-time substitute. Meza became a regular starter and, according to her Reign teammate Lynn Biyendolo, became the "engine of [the Reign] midfield."

Lynn talks @reignfc teammate Sam Meza, who just earned her first USWNT call-up. The 23yo midfielder was drafted by Seattle in 2024 & opted to go on loan with @dallastrinityfc in the USL Super League to get more playing time, a decision that proved instrumental in her career ✨ pic.twitter.com/6mLos5ZsId

Meza grew up in Balch Springs and played club soccer for Solar Soccer Club. She played collegiately for the University of North Carolina and was a four-year starter.

The USWNT will play against Ireland twice – on June 25 and 29 – and versus Canada on July 2.

Real Madrid did not have the best of starts to their FIFA Club World Cup campaign, drawing 1-1 draw with Al-Hilal.

Real Madrid's next match is on June 22, when they take on Mexican side Pachuca at the Bank of America stadium in North Carolina.

Having played their first match in rough terrain, however, Real Madrid appear to have grown a bit wary of the pitch conditions in the United States, which may be sensitive to many European players.

According to MARCA, Real Madrid took no chances ahead of their next matches and sent emissaries to inspect the quality of the pitches at the stadiums they are scheduled to play in.

The move was made after concerns were raised by FIFA and reinforced by previous bad experiences on American soil, particularly injuries to key players during past pre-season tours.

The inspection team prepared a full report that was handed over to the club's medical department.

After reviewing the findings, the medical team advised against using players who have suffered ACL injuries in recent times, namely Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, and David Alaba.

This recommendation does not necessarily mean the trio won't feature at all during the tournament, but it introduces an element of caution.

Ultimately, any decision regarding their participation will be made collaboratively between the player, medical staff, and coach Xabi Alonso, based on how the players feel physically.

So far, Militao is said to be ahead in terms of recovery and integration with the group, while Carvajal and Alaba continue to take it slower.

Representative Darin LaHood, who co-chairs the Congressional Soccer Caucus, has urged President Donald Trump to enact an executive order to protect the American skies from the threat of drones during the FIFA World Cup in 2026.

Congressman LaHood, who has served as a U.S. representative from Illinois for almost ten years, has been pressing the administration on several issues relating to the operations, logistics and security of the World Cup. Rep. LaHood is a Republican but the Soccer Caucus is a bipartisan initiative aimed at promoting the interests of soccer within the United States. They have lobbied the White House to sign off on a $625m federal funding request to assist security needs during the World Cup, which is edging closer, but he also believes a change to the law is required, which would best enable suspect drones to be taken out in the host cities.

LaHood also serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which oversees the nation's intelligence agencies.

President Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” includes $500 million to be made available until 2029 for “state and local capabilities to detect, identify, track or monitor threats from unmanned aircraft systems (otherwise known as drones).” The act must still pass through the U.S. Senate but is expected to do so.

Trump has also signed a series of executive orders relating to drones in recent weeks, both aimed at increasing U.S. manufacturing of drones but also greater counter-drone capabilities. A White House fact sheet claimed that drones “pose a growing threat as criminals, terrorists, and hostile foreign actors increasingly weaponize these technologies to endanger public safety and national security.”

A bipartisan coalition has been working within Congress to alter the law. Currently, only federal authorities are permitted to counter rogue drones but state and local authorities are often more heavily involved in securing events at stadiums or mass gatherings.

The DEFENSE Act (Disabling Enemy Flight Entry and Neutralizing Suspect Equipment Act) would change this by granting temporary authority to state and local officers who have received appropriate training to use counter-drone technology and respond to threats. The proposed act has the backing of the NFL, MLB, NCAA and NASCAR.

Rep. LaHood, however, believes an executive order may be necessary to ensure those securing World Cup games and fan festivals have the requisite training and powers ahead of the World Cup, which starts in June 2026. An executive order, he says, would establish a protocol to protect World Cup stadiums, with collaboration between the U.S. Military, the federal national security agencies and state and local law enforcement.

“I was up at MetLife with the (White House FIFA World Cup) Task Force recently,” Rep. La Hood told The Athletic. “We met with the head of security for FIFA and we did a drone demonstration. We had all of the security apparatus there. We talked a lot about an executive order that will be needed because I'm not optimistic we'll pass legislation to establish the right protocols for what we need with drones for the 11 cities.

“I'll try to simplify it as much as I can. If a drone flew over Russia at the World Cup in 2018, or Qatar (in 2022), it immediately gets shot down. No questions about it. It's gone. There were mechanisms in place to do that. In the U.S., we have not regulated drones, there's (even) been a purposeful effort in Congress to let the drone industry prosper and thrive in the free market system.

“There is legislation introduced by Senator Tom Cotton that would establish a protocol and this would be helpful for regulating drones. But I don't anticipate that's going to get the consensus of Congress between now and then.

“As you might imagine, there's liability issues here, there's contractual issues, there's timing issues. For example, how far is the aperture of the zone around the 11 host cities? MetLife is close to Newark airport (around 12 miles away) – how do you do that? It's not as easy as it sounds but there will be one particular agency designated to secure the perimeter and make sure no drones are infiltrating the area where games are being played.”

Michael Evanoff is the global chief security officer of the U.S. security technology company Verkada and former Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security.

He told The Athletic: “Drone activity is at the highest it's ever been. Wars going forward will always have drones. It's a delivery system to hurt and kill. The Super Bowl has a no-fly zone for drones. So there's counter-drone technology that is in place that basically keeps the environment from being utilised by drones.

“How would they know if drones are in the air? There's a signature given down, which comes to a central point for the authorities who then say, ‘Hey, we have a drone in the air. It's not one of our drones, we need to take it out.' When I say take it out, they use the environment to seize it. I've seen counter-drones that use nets.

“So a bigger drone comes on with a net around the other encircling drone. The weighted net brings it down obviously over a nice area where you're not hitting cars and people, but there are counter technologies for that. It is normal that we do have a no-fly for the Super Bowl. Open-air stadiums will definitely not want to have a drone in their area.”

The White House was approached for comment.

What a Thursday night that was, drama in abundance at the Club World Cup and weirdest of all, a solid, professional and fairly quiet win for the USMNT. Could there be any more perfect way to get the weekend started? I'm James Benge, let's dive into the wonderful wonder of soccer.

What a night of Club World Cup action that was. Whether you were all in on the tournament from the start, or (like many) a bit more skeptical, it's fair to assume that what you probably wanted to see was the European giants knocked down a peg or two by the rest of the world. Unless you happen to support one of those teams, there is nothing that makes intercontinental football more exhilarating than that. And we got it in abundance.

First, the brilliance of Lionel Messi. In what felt like a wonderful callback to his unforgettable first few weeks in pink, the great man found himself stood over a free kick just outside the D. You knew what was coming. Fired at the keeper's side, the sheer swerve that Messi got on his effort took Claudio Ramos by surprise, the ball bending elegantly into the side netting to cap an outstanding comeback for Inter Miami, 2-1 winners over Porto at Hard Rock Stadium.

That in itself was as much a triumph for young head coach Javier Mascherano as it was Messi's brilliance (and Ramos' shortcomings). As Chuck Booth notes, Inter Miami had weathered a Porto storm in the first half even after Samu Aghehowa's early penalty. The Herons came back with bite (or is that a stabbing motion from those long beaks) and were swiftly rewarded with Telasco Segovia's equaliser.

If there was a caveat to Miami's win, though, it was that they were hardly playing Europe's finest. Porto had been a fair way back in third place in the Portuguese league last season and were swiftly dumped out of the Europa League. Usually at the Club World Cup European sides have financial resources that vastly outweigh their opponents, but there was only one team on the field yesterday that could afford Messi and Sergio Busquets. This was the first competitive win by an MLS club against a UEFA opponent, but really, it was by some distance the best opportunity.

You couldn't argue the field was as level in Pasadena. Botafogo might be one of Brazil's big 12, with a US owner in John Textor who has backed their development into Copa Libertadores winners, wowever they hardly have the resources to compete with Paris Saint-Germain, whose payroll is one of the most generous in sport. The European champions weren't at their absolute strongest, but you'd have fancied Luis Enrique's starting XI to overcome plenty of Champions League opponents, let alone Botafogo.

And yet, the Brazilians will not feel they got away with one in winning 1-0 at the Rose Bowl. Igor Jesus showed fight and speed to earn the lucky deflection that wrong-footed Gianluigi Donnarumma in the first half, and from there on Botafogo defended their lead manfully. John Victor had only one save to make after the opener while there were plenty of defenders around the world who could learn from how Alex Telles and company dealt with Desire Doue. He wasn't the only one to struggle, as Luis Enrique noted.

PSG should have a chance to make amends in the knockout stages. Seattle Sounders are up next and though the MLS side are not absolutely eliminated after their 3-1 loss to Atletico Madrid, they'd need to beat the Champions League winners by a handy margin and hope for a favor from Botafogo against the Spaniards.

That latter part does at least seem quite plausible with South American sides in the midst of their season proving to be more than a match for their tiring opponents from Europe. That was what made Botafogo's win so exciting. You sense there might be more to come.

Now that is just what Mauricio Pochettino needed. A 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia means the Stars and Stripes are through to the quarterfinals of the Gold Cup with a game to spare, affording more opportunities to experiment with the fringe players who have performed so impressively in the first two games. Sebastian Berhalter, son of former USMNT coach Gregg, was the latest to impress, delivering a gorgeous free kick from deep on the right which was just begging for Chris Richards to get a boot on it.

That goal was more than enough in what was an impressive defensive display, Saudi Arabia limited to just three shots and 0.3 expected goals across the 90 minutes. Best of all, there were signs of Pochettino's out of possession approach working effectively. The US press limited the effectiveness of Saudi passes and kept the visitors to just six touches in the penalty area. It wasn't entirely without fault, Richards making a big tackle in the first half, and perhaps if the Arabian Eagles had had Salem Al-Dawsari in the XI they would have had more success in one on one duels. Still, whatever the level of opposition, it is no bad thing to so comprehensively shut them out.

The attack, mind, was a little less effective, Diego Luna and Malik Tillman in particular quieter than they had been in the win against Trinidad and Tobago first time out. It didn't help either that Haji Wright was unavailable with an Achilles issue, one for which Pochettino was unable to offer a timescale on his recovery. The USMNT might need more attacking oomph to win the knockout games and yet given the absences of Folarin Balogun, Christian Pulisic and Ricardo Pepi -- to name but a few -- it always seemed likely that the goals would be harder to find in some games. At least if that is the case, the US look solid at the back.

With the group stage approaching halfway, it is time to take stock of key issues surrounding the expanded tournament

The Club World Cup is into the second round of games in the group stage, with matches across the United States showing off all that was hotly anticipated about this newly expanded tournament, as well as a few concerns.

Here's a breakdown of five major storylines we were keeping track of before the games, and where we stand.

Your view on how well-attended these games have been depends heavily on your perspective. Empty seats have been visible, sometimes in great numbers, at nearly every game (none of which have been sellouts). That said, the raw attendance numbers have not been bad, considering that many kick-off times have fallen at noon or 3pm during workdays.

There have been 20 games at the Club World Cup so far. The average attendance has been 35,525. The median is about the same. About 730,000 tickets have been sold or distributed for these matches. All of these are reasonably solid figures.

On the other hand, the stadiums have, on average, been about 55% full. The median percentage of capacity used – a figure that gives less weight to outliers such as the 3,142 who attended Mamelodi Sundowns v Ulsan in Orlando – is 45%. With a few exceptions, the tournament is being playing in massive NFL stadiums, and that means a lot of empty seats.

The environments, though, have largely been very good. South American fans in particular have brought it, with Brazilians in New York and Argentinians in Miami creating noisy and invested atmospheres that seem right at home at a tournament with the World Cup name.

Thanks to the massiveness of these stadiums, though, the optics are not always the best.

It's been hot at times, but the tournament has also been lucky so far in that many cities, especially New York, have been experiencing cooler-than-normal temperatures over the past week. The most notable exception was Paris Saint-Germain v Atlético Madrid at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, where the heat combined with crowd control issues and a lack of water contributed to what the Guardian was told was a “dangerous” environment for fans. It wasn't comfortable for the players either.

“Playing in this heat is impossible,” Atlético's Marcos Llorente said. “The heat is terrible. My toes hurt, even my toenails … We are adapting to the heat of playing at these hours … no one in Europe is used to it.”

The next several days will see more of these situations. A brutal heatwave is set to hit much of the eastern United States starting on Friday, covering many of the stadiums where the remaining games will be played. Evening kick-offs will be hot but theoretically bearable once the sun is down. The problematic games will be those that kick off in the afternoon local time – there are 14 of those left in the group stage, including six that start at noon, when the heat will probably be at its worst in the direct sunlight.

And that's without even getting into weather delays. Already, there have been three – mostly for lightning as thunderstorms have gathered amid the humid weather. There is very little Fifa can do about those, of course – but it's a trend worth keeping an eye on. There is a chance, of course, the delays could disrupt the simultaneous kick-offs in the group finales.

The opening matches of this tournament were awash with reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and/or Customs and Border Protection officers would be present at games and looking to continue their public raids, which have been met with counterprotests across the country. That has yet to happen.

Make no mistake, security is high at these games, as they are at any major sporting event in the United States. But there haven't been any reported attempts at mass arrests as there have been in other places around the country.

That is not to say politics, world events and the tournament haven't overlapped. Mehdi Taremi, Inter's Iran striker, has been forced to miss the tournament after being stuck in Tehran after Israel's attacks on the city. And this week Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino, and a delegation from Juventus (including the US internationals Weston McKennie and Tim Weah) stood in the Oval Office as Donald Trump answered questions about a potential war with Iran and awkwardly asked the players if women could play for Juventus (a reference to the rightwing talking point about trans women in women's sports).

On the field, the story of the tournament so far has been the performance of South American clubs. Teams representing Conmebol have not lost, the only undefeated confederation remaining after one matchday in every group. They've achieved some pretty big results along the way – including Botafogo's 1-0 win over the Champions League winners, PSG, on Thursday night, and Boca Juniors' 2-2 draw with Benfica.

Asian and Oceanian teams are having far less fun. The confederations' five teams have yet to win, with Auckland City suffering a 10-0 demolition by Bayern Munich. The lone bright spot for Asian clubs was Al-Hilal's 1-1 draw with Real Madrid – a game in which the Saudi Pro League side looked every bit Madrid's equals in Xabi Alonso's first game in charge.

Generally speaking, and in line with past editions of the Club World Cup, the so-called “smaller” teams are the ones bringing real life to this party, while most Uefa teams are waiting for their first big challenge. The final group games and knockouts should be plenty of fun.

It's a bit early to say anyone is making a case for the Golden Ball given most teams have played one game, but a few players have stood out.

One, unsurprisingly, is Lionel Messi. The Inter Miami superstar is a player Fifa bent over backwards to get into the tournament, awarding his team a “host nation” slot after they failed to qualify through other means. That decision has paid off. Messi is 37 and has clearly slowed a little, but he remains capable of delivering in big moments, as he did with a winning free-kick goal against Porto.

Pretty much every Bayern player stands out after that ridiculous scoreline, even if it came against amateur opposition. Jamal Musiala has the early claim on the Golden Boot, having scored a hat-trick in that game.

For Manchester City, Phil Foden got off on the right foot with a goal and an assist against Wydad, and Chelsea's new signing Liam Delap made a positive impact on his debut, a 2-0 win over Los Angeles FC.

Kylian Mbappé, meanwhile, has been a notable absence, having been briefly in hospital this week with gastroenteritis.

            For 19-year-old Amina from Ifrane, a small mountain town known as the “Switzerland of Morocco,” dead dogs are a common sight. Amina requested that CNN refer to her by a pseudonym for fear of retribution by Moroccan authorities.
    


            “Walking to school, I would pass pools of blood on the street,” she recalled in an interview with CNN. “At a certain point, I realized it wasn't normal to start your day stepping over dead bodies.”
    


            According to Amina, the killings have gotten especially bad in the last year. “There used to be occasional shootings every few months,” she said. “Now, they are more systematic. They kill dogs like it's a sport – like people hunt ducks.”
    


            Animal welfare groups say the killings are part of a campaign to “clean up” Morocco's streets ahead of the 2030 FIFA World Cup, which the nation is co-hosting with Spain and Portugal, while Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina will all host stage an opening match each.
    


            “Individuals armed with rifles go out into the streets, often at night, and shoot the dogs,” Les Ward, head of the International Animal Welfare Protection Coalition (IAWPC), told CNN. “Others are rounded up and taken to municipal dispensaries where they are poisoned. They simply disappear.”
    


            Omar Jaïd, President of the Provincial Tourism Council of Ifrane, told CNN that the city has “started cleaning the streets of stray dogs, as part of our preparations for the 2030 FIFA World Cup.” Ifrane is roughly a 40-mile drive (about 64 kilometers) from Fez Stadium, one of the proposed tournament venues which is expected to host a multitude of national soccer teams alongside thousands of visitors.
    


            Jaïd added that the animals are rounded up and relocated to dispensaries where they can be vaccinated. He emphasized he is a “dog lover.”
    


            Amina, however, witnessed something different.
    


            On the night of February 9, 2024, she was jolted awake by the sound of gunshots. Stepping outside, she discovered three dead dogs in a dumpster. One of them was a male husky she knew from the neighborhood.
    


            “I was terrified,” she recalled. “I carried the husky out of the trash can, covered in blood. I didn't know what to do. I felt so helpless.”
    


            CNN cannot independently confirm who killed the dogs. CNN contacted Ifrane municipality for comment but did not hear back.
    


            “Stray dogs pose a serious public health risk, particularly as carriers of rabies,” Mohammed Roudani, head of the Public Health and Green Spaces Division at Morocco's Ministry of Interior, told CNN. “Around 100,000 people are bitten every year, 40% of them children under 15.”
    


            In 2019, Morocco's government introduced the Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (TNVR) program, a humane strategy to control stray dog populations. “We are working with local authorities to implement this in compliance with animal welfare standards,” Roudani said.
    


            But there's a major obstacle: municipalities, not the national government, are responsible for managing stray animals. “There's a legal vacuum,” Roudani explained. “Some cities still rely on traditional methods, and there's currently no law against killing stray dogs.”
    


            In some cities, stray dogs are poisoned with strychnine, a pesticide banned in many countries for causing inhumane suffering. “We must deal with the issue in a different way,” Roudani said. “No more slaughter. No more strychnine. We need an ethical solution.”
    


            CNN has verified footage of dog culling in cities including Marrakech, Casablanca, Agadir and Ifrane. Videos filmed as recently as May 2025 show dogs being restrained with metal wires and tossed into pickup trucks already filled with carcasses.
    


            And it's not just animals at risk.
    


            On January 24, Abderrahim Sounni, a barista in the town of Ben Ahmed, had just finished his shift when a stray dog dashed past him, chased by a car.
    


            Gunshots rang out and three bullets missed the dog, instead striking Sounni in the knee and thigh. The 34-year-old recounted the incident in a local media interview, later confirming the details in a call with CNN.
    


            Sounni didn't believe the shooter saw him but was instead focused on the dog. As he cried out for help, bleeding on the sidewalk, the vehicle sped away.
    


            Bystanders found him and he was rushed to a hospital in Casablanca, where doctors were unable to remove the bullets. He said police later informed him that the vehicle belonged to the municipality.
    


            CNN has contacted the local police, who didn't comment on the incident. Sounni declined to provide further comment to CNN, saying he felt overwhelmed by the media attention.
    


            “It's gotten to the point where people are in danger,” IAWPC chairman Ward told CNN. “You can't have shootings happening on the street – especially during a World Cup with thousands of tourists.”
    


            In February this year, a coalition of 10 animal rights groups urged FIFA to address Morocco's “increased capture and culling” of stray dogs ahead of the 2030 World Cup.
    


            In a letter addressed to FIFA's Secretary General, conservationist Jane Goodall said she was “absolutely appalled” to see Morocco's government “engaging in large-scale killings of street dogs as part of an apparent effort to make FIFA World Cup venues more ‘presentable' to foreign visitors.”
    


            FIFA did not respond to the letter but told CNN in a statement that Morocco's World Cup bid “outlined its commitment to the protection of animal rights,” including the expansion of “clinics and support programs for stray dogs.”
    


            “FIFA is following up with its local counterparts with the aim to ensure commitments are upheld,” the statement said.
    


            As international scrutiny has grown, the dog catchers appear to have become more discreet, particularly in tourist hubs like Marrakech.
    


            Jane Wilson and Louise Jackson – two British residents living in Marrakech – told CNN that, until last year, vans openly displayed cages in the back with dead and alive dogs in plain sight. Now, unmarked white vans quietly patrol the streets, seizing stray animals, they said.
    


            In Casablanca, vans bearing the logo of Casa Baia, a municipal development company, are rounding up animals. Owned by the municipality, the company's website claims its “expert teams are permanently mobilized” to “capture and impound” more than 20,000 stray dogs per year.
    


            CNN reviewed footage prepared by an animal rights group showing dogs being dragged into Casa Baia vehicles with metal chains. Smaller dogs are shown ensnared in fishing nets, their bodies thrashing in distress before being thrown into white vans.
    


            Erin Captain, originally from Indiana, moved to Casablanca with her husband last year and quickly grew attached to the local strays. “They're amazing creatures,” she said. “I began caring for two puppies: vaccinating and feeding them, watching them grow.”
    


            Then, one by one, the neighborhood dogs started disappearing. Captain told CNN that Casa Baia vans prowled the streets day and night. One night, she says, they came for her puppies.
    


            “They took them from outside our house, kicking them,” she recalled. “One had its little legs broken; the other was kicked to death. It was a nightmare – I was terrified. My husband had to step in before they drove off.”
    


            For months, Captain paid to vaccinate as many dogs as she could. “But the dog catchers came and killed them anyway,” she said. “It's more barbaric than you can imagine. I don't sleep anymore.”
    


            Reached by CNN, a spokesperson for Casa Baia declined to comment on accusations of killing stray dogs or using inhumane methods to capture stray dogs.
    


            FIFA has been aware of Morocco's dog culling since at least 2023. That March, the European Link Coalition (ELC), a UK-based NGO, met with senior FIFA officials to present evidence of a rise in culling ahead of the 2030 World Cup. The materials included dozens of photos, videos, and witness testimonies – some directly referencing Casa Baia.
    


            In April 2024, FIFA Human Rights Advisor Marta Piazza told ELC that the organization “truly valued” their input and was engaging with Morocco's government to “ensure alignment with FIFA's bidding requirements” – the checklist of services and standards expected of a prospective host nation.
    


            A “suggested way forward” was promised in the coming weeks.
    


            According to the ELC, FIFA then fell silent. The organization says it hasn't heard from Piazza or her colleagues since. In response to CNN's request for comment, FIFA said it is “in contact with animal welfare organizations on this important matter.”
    


            Morocco's government is taking steps to regulate dog culling practices.
    


            Last month, Roudani and his colleagues submitted a draft law mandating municipalities to stop killing stray animals and implement TNVR programs.
    


            In a statement to CNN, FIFA said it had contacted the Moroccan Football Federation and “received confirmation that a number of measures have been implemented over the last 5 years,” with new legislation in the works aimed at balancing public health and animal welfare.
    


            The issue is drawing global attention ahead of the 2030 World Cup, with celebrities including Ricky Gervais and Peter Egan condemning the killings on X, calling them a “slaughter.”
    


            “Football fans around the world love dogs,” Minky Worden of Human Rights Watch told CNN. “Animal mistreatment could become a major PR issue if FIFA doesn't take concrete action.”
    


            “It's not just a question of animal mistreatment,” added Nick McGeehan, co-director of rights group FairSquare. “Having a clear knowledge of issues and choosing to ignore them – that's a breach of basic human decency.”

Bayern is favored at a -500 price, with the over/under set at 3.5 (+105o / -139u) goals.

Let's get into my Boca Juniors vs. Bayern prediction.

Pick:  Bayern Munich -0.75 First Half Asian Handicap (-133)
My Bayern Munich vs. Boca Juniors best bet is on Bayern Munich -0.75 First Half Asian Handicap as I see value on the German side to win comfortably.

Leg 1: Bayern Munich -0.75 First Half Asian Handicap (-133)Leg 2: Bayern Munich -2 Asian Handicap (+100)Leg 3: Under 3.5 Bayern Goals & Over 2.5 Bayern First Half Corners (+100)

Bayern put 10 past Auckland City in their opener and although Boca Juniors are a far better opponent, there's still a considerable gap between the Bundesliga champions and the Argentine outfit.

Boca's aging squad isn't capable of dealing with Bayern's deadly front line of quick attackers. Marcos Rojo (35), Rodrigo Battaglia (33), Ander Herrera (35), and Edinson Cavani (38) are far too slow to compete at this level – they are all regulars within Boca's starting 11.

The Bundesliga champions were in incredible scoring form before they ran into Auckland City. They registered an average of 2.6 goals per game in their past five Bundesliga outings. Kompany's men also netted an average of 2.21 goals per game in the Champions League, the fourth-best scoring rate in the competition.

Although heavy favorites with the bookmakers, and maybe rightly so, BETSiE projects 'just' 2.38xG for the Germans versus Boca. Considering the Asian Handicap line is set at -2.0, you might have expected a more favorable outcome. Following BETSiE's train of thought, it brings the Under 3.5 Bayern goals selection into play and suggests four goals might be a step too far. The -550 price on Bayern makes them overvalued. They shouldn't be so short on MD2.

Projected Chance of Winning

Projected Total Goals

There wasn't much to learn from Bayern's 10-0 hammering against semi-professional outfit Auckland City aside from the fact that Vincent Kompany is taking this competition incredibly seriously. The match also showed their strength in depth, and if they can keep their best players fit, the Bundesliga champions are a real threat to go all the way in the US.

However, there's no doubt that they would have been grateful not to have faced Boca in their opening match. Witnessing the Argentine's physical, aggressive nature versus Benfica will see them come into this one slightly more prepared.

Boca was very much in Benfica's face from the first whistle. If they allowed Benfica to find their rhythm, they would have likely lost, and they knew that. But, despite Boca enjoying a solid 30 minutes that saw them go 2-0 up, they once again pressed the self-destruct button despite having a man advantage.

This is where Bayern can be more streetwise than the Portuguese. If Kompany's team can score first and take control, the gaps will start to appear for Boca, who were flat-footed towards the end of their first match.

Boca's high energy was impressive, but in the hot conditions, it is unsustainable for 90 minutes. Bayern have so much quality across the pitch; they are a level above Benfica in front of goal, and Boca won't be able to live with them.

International Football

AUSTIN, Texas — The U.S. men's national team is just a few weeks removed from the bitterness of two friendly defeats, the second of which was particularly ugly. Not nearly enough time has passed to have forgotten completely the feeling those results wrought on the group.

That made it easier for Mauricio Pochettino to deliver his postgame message after the U.S. gutted out a not-so-perfect 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia on Thursday night to secure a spot in the Concacaf Gold Cup quarterfinals.

“Enjoy that feeling,” Pochettino told the group. “Understand what that feeling is like and what you just had to do, all that emotion you put out on the field, because it doesn't come easy. So you know what you have to do now. You need to continue to do and replicate that.”

It is one thing to believe that you have a process and that the process is working. It is harder to transmit that belief when the results are not going your way. That's why the one-goal victory over Saudi Arabia was so important, even if it wasn't pretty. The U.S. has now won back-to-back games. The confidence and belief in the group grows a bit more as a result. And Pochettino's message resonates more, too.

“One of the important things to survive in this business … is to see things that maybe sometimes people cannot see,” Pochettino said. “And I think our point is not the knowledge about the game, is not about in the way that we want to approach the game, if we use different systems or not. It is to anticipate situations that people sometimes, like in all the business [don't have] the possibility to see. That's important. When everyone wants to destroy everything, sometimes you say, ‘No, we are [OK.]' Because it's difficult to defend when you don't win. It's difficult to say, ‘No, but we are in a good way.' …

“I think [those bad results are part of] a process that is going to provide us the possibility to be more solid and bring the victories that we want.”

Pochettino clearly came into this summer with ideas he wanted to transmit through his decisions — on whom to bring, on what to say publicly, on how the team sets up and who is starting. The results didn't happen right away. Pochettino said he was calm. He told the group to keep trusting.

So Gold Cup wins over Trinidad and Tobago and Saudi Arabia matter. Not because of the quality of the opponent or even the level of the team. But because results are what help foster buy-in.

“We lost two games, and then we lost another two games after. I was really, really relaxed. And you can ask the players after Switzerland, [I was] saying, ‘Hey, look guys, relax. Now it's time to rest. Is to analyze the situation.' And sometimes you need to be honest. And I think it was my mistake or our mistake, and [so I said], ‘Hey, calm, we are going to prepare, and for sure, we are going to arrive in a very good condition.' And maybe these few words … when you tell [players] something and that [happens], then that is going to be a very good group, very united and [they are going to] trust each other and go and fight. Because we know that we are all [in it] together.”

Pochettino said his staff can sense it coming together. They can “smell it,” he said.

They have to hope that the positivity continues to permeate, because it was clear in Austin that the apathy around this program is very real. The results haven't been good, and the vibes have been worse. Attendance at Q2 Stadium was just 11,727. That follows just 12,610 in San Jose, Calif., on Sunday against T&T. The optics probably won't be any better vs. Haiti this Sunday at the cavernous AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.

Fans are opting out of paying high ticket prices to watch a team that hasn't been performing, which should be a glaring signal for U.S. Soccer. There is less than a year until the 2026 World Cup begins. The priority needs to be on getting full stadiums and generating momentum around the team. It puts enormous pressure on U.S. Soccer to set its ticket prices appropriately for its slate of friendlies in September, October, November, March and next June.

Price points haven't been the only issue, though. The U.S. men need to get people to start believing that they're worth coming out to watch.

There wasn't a ton on Thursday that fulfilled that narrative. The Americans had the ball for most of the game, generating 67 percent possession and 469 passes. And yet they mustered just five shots and 0.70 expected goals.

It was an imperfect performance. But Pochettino is more worried about finding the moments he can pull from the game that underline his message.

It was Chris Richards sprinting back and sliding to block a shot on a clear Saudi transition attack that could have led to a goal. It was Sebastian Berhalter mixing it up with the Saudi team. Most importantly, it was the final scoreline.

The simplest way to relay what Pochettino said is this: In this business, it's the results that matter. That's it. And that's what the U.S. has been lacking over the last 18 months. They need to start winning games. The style points are just a bonus.

This U.S. group has holes. Of course it does. We know about the guys missing from this tournament. We know about the weaknesses that exist even when many of those players are present. That was on display against Panama in the Nations League in March.

With time ticking down toward the summer of 2026, it's about finding the right mentality and the right combinations and the right belief to start winning again.

Pochettino was asked about that goal – about how to coach it into a team.

“It's the hardest part of coaching, it is difficult because it takes time, because it's a process,” Pochettino said. “Coaching the offensive, defensive, tactical, and game aspects is something any coach or every coach has sufficient knowledge to do. After that, it's the values you transmit as a coaching staff. Not just me, but my entire coaching staff. That's what we want to create, that environment or that relationship that has to exist. The habits. The habits we think should exist in a team that wants to compete for big things, which have to be fundamental. … Culture is created through the habits you have. Culture isn't created by talking, culture isn't created by giving theoretical lessons, it's created with decisions, with actions. We often talk now with the players, about not talking on the field, but rather speaking with actions, because we can all communicate well, and all of us in a football environment have that ability to communicate. …

“It can be very nice to say things, but then you have to translate it onto the field. … That's what truly dictates what we are. And that requires, as I was saying before, actions. Creating good habits, the habits that we think are fundamental to being competitive in any team. Because otherwise we would be a group of players who don't come together. We wouldn't be a team. We would be a group of players who play together, and nothing more. And to achieve a team, you need a foundation of values that we all agree to respect and follow.”

Pochettino was then asked whether his team was there yet.

“We are currently under construction,” he said.

The 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia showed that. It was far from perfect. But it was a win. For a group that's trying to become a team and craft its values, finding a way to get the three points was important.

The hope is that it now builds a little bit more. For the players in the locker room, for the players watching at home and for the fans who want to know whether they can start to believe again that this group of players can be the team they want it to be.

It will take a lot more — and there will most definitely be more setbacks. For now, this U.S. group will have to settle for a slight spark of belief that this can get back on track.

“It's just that,” midfielder Tyler Adams said. “It's belief.”

Gab Marcotti disagrees with Mauricio Pochettino's comments on Christian Pulisic after he misses the Gold Cup for the USMNT. (1:33)

Even with two wins to start the Concacaf Gold Cup, it appears the U.S. men's national team is in crisis.

Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Yunus Musah have already asked out of the Gold Cup. A trio of other potential or likely starters, Gio Reyna of Borussia Dortmund, and Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah of Juventus, didn't participate because of the Club World Cup. Then, both Monaco's Folarin Balogun and PSV's Sergiño Dest -- perhaps the two players with the highest ceiling-raising potential in the player pool -- aren't on the U.S. roster because of injuries.

This was supposed to be the USMNT's last chance to test itself in competitive matches before next summer's World Cup -- and a chance to right the wrongs of the 1-0 Nations League loss to Panama. Without something like 80% or 90% of the expected starting lineup next summer, it could have transformed into an opportunity for some fringe players to make a case to play a bigger role in Mauricio Pochettino's plans once the matches matter again.

But then came the friendlies against Switzerland and Turkey: two losses, by a combined score of 6-1, against two teams the U.S. needs to be better than if it seeks a deep run in 2026.

It wasn't just that the U.S. lost these matches -- it was what the losses signified. This was a group of players that didn't appear to care. The play was uninspired, as was the attitude of the team's stars.

Former USMNT star Landon Donovan ripped Pulisic's commitment to the national team. Pulisic's dad responded by screenshotting a conversation he had with ChatGPT. The AC Milan star told Donovan to say it to his face and revealed that he had asked Pochettino if he could play in the two friendlies and then skip the Gold Cup. This led to Pochettino clarifying his role as the manager who makes personnel decisions and his personhood: "When I signed my contract with the federation, I am the head coach. I am not a mannequin."

A year before co-hosting the World Cup, the USMNT under Pochettino promised to be on a steady upward trajectory. Instead, its best players are playing golf rather than soccer. Parents are feuding with former players. The captain and coach are airing their dirty laundry in public. And that expensive, experienced, supposed-to-be-transformative coach has barely changed anything.

That sounds like a disaster -- but it also sounds like the situation at pretty much every world-class national team at some point over the past decade. These are growing pains as the United States is slowly becoming a real soccer country.

American soccer players probably don't care about playing for the USMNT as much as they used to. In the long run, that is a good thing.

Let's go back to 1994, essentially the birth of modern American soccer as we know it. The U.S. was hosting the World Cup, Alexi Lalas was still a harmlessly peculiar guy with a bright-red beard and a guitar, the uniforms were acid-wash denim, and MLS didn't kick off for another couple of years.

Almost none of the players were good enough to play abroad, and even if they could, there was still a stigma against signing American soccer players. So, instead, the U.S. Soccer Federation signed a large chunk of the roster as essentially full-time USMNT players. The team trained together for two years and played in just about every international tournament it could enter. At the 1994 World Cup, more than half of the roster (14 players) listed the U.S. Soccer as their employer.

Four years later, no one was a full-time U.S. Soccer player, but 16 guys were playing professionally in a league that didn't exist in 1994: Major League Soccer. Then, at the 2002 World Cup, an MLS player won Best Young Player as a 20-year-old Landon Donovan led the USMNT to a quarterfinal loss against Germany. Donovan, though, was on loan to the San Jose Earthquakes from Bayer Leverkusen, who had just lost the Champions League final 2-1 to Real Madrid and that Zinedine Zidane goal.

Donovan was shoved into an ecosystem that still didn't have a place for him. Leverkusen signed him at 17. He was a superstar across the youth levels and had to carry the weight of American fan expectation on his shoulders. Donovan has talked about how hard it was to live in Germany and be a professional while his friends were still in high school, an ocean away. He was alone -- there was no one else like him, in a position like him, anywhere else in the world.

If Donovan made it at Leverkusen, it would prove something about American soccer -- that our best players could play for the best teams in the world. But it didn't work out for him at Leverkusen, and outside of a couple of beloved loan spells with Everton, he spent most of his career in MLS.

So, unsurprisingly, playing for the USMNT meant a lot to him. It was a chance to prove that failure at Leverkusen didn't have anything to do with talent. He could play at this level if he wanted to. On a more universal level, for him and most of his teammates, games with the USMNT were the highest-level matches they would play.

The USMNT's matches at the World Cup, Confederations Cup, and against Mexico were much more difficult than the games most of its MLS-based players played weekly. These games were so important, in part, because they could push their limits.

An increasing-but-still-small number of Americans started to play in Europe during Donovan's USMNT career, but most of them began in MLS. And because their numbers abroad were still so limited and most of them weren't competing for titles and playing in the Champions League, winning games with the USMNT was a way to legitimize American soccer -- even if it meant flying thousands of miles across the Atlantic Ocean every season.

That's not the case anymore. With teenage American prospects at almost every major club academy in the world, eight senior players in the current pool who cost at least $20 million in transfer fees, and a growing number featuring in the Champions League every season, the national team doesn't matter like it did.

As much as FIFA tries to increase its influence, UEFA is still in control.

The Champions League is the pinnacle of the sport: The competition makes around $4 billion per year and the soccer is being played at a higher technical and physical level than anything else we've seen. The World Cup will always be the bigger event because of the history, the scarcity and the fact that the world is participating, but the best players in the world are playing the best soccer in the world on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from September through May.

This has created tensions between leagues and national federations, players and their national teams, and fan expectations and reality.

Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski are all incredibly wealthy, all-time great players -- and the main reason is what they've done for their club teams. Their national team careers? Practically irrelevant.

Mbappe became someone your dad knew because of the 2018 World Cup, and the 2022 World Cup final between him and Messi was arguably the greatest game ever. But Mbappe has been paid over $400 million by the various club teams across his career, and Paris Saint-Germain paid around $200 million to acquire Mbappe ... the summer before the 2018 World Cup.

For most of Messi's career, the national team was a weird anomaly -- everyone agreed this was one of the greatest players ever because of what he did with Barcelona. With Lewandowski, Poland has nothing to do with his legacy or status in the game. He will go down as the best center forward of the 21st century -- solely because he has scored 500-plus goals for Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Barcelona.

Messi, still in his prime, retired from the national team for a few months, partially because of frustration with the Argentine national federation. Mbappe briefly stopped playing for France -- missing multiple Nations League matches -- last fall. And most recently and most familiar: Lewandowski recently got Poland's manager fired. The Barcelona forward said he wouldn't play in the team's two World Cup qualifiers this month because of "physical and mental tiredness" from the club season, so the coach stripped him of his captaincy. Then, Lewandowski said he would stop playing for Poland if Michał Probierz remained the coach, and now Probierz is no longer the coach.

Similar to Lewandowski, the majority of players at the highest level are tired because they play too many games. The most recent study from FIFPro, the international players' union, found that 70% of surveyed players think a guaranteed rest period each season is necessary. For last season, the study defined 55 games played or more as an "excessive workload," and for the players who hit that mark, 30% of their matches were with their national team.

"The schedule is very tough, especially for those of us from South America because we have 12-hour flights there and 12-hour flights back," said Real Madrid star Federico Valverde, who represents Uruguay at the international level. "There are times when it's too much for our bodies."

This is the downside of what American soccer fans have been wanting. As more Americans are playing at the highest level in Europe, why wouldn't they also feel this way? Why wouldn't they also want to spend less time traveling to and playing with their national teams?

Kasey Keller breaks down the situation between Christian Pulisic and Mauricio Pochettino, in which Pochettino said Pulisic isn't allowed to dictate games he plays in.

Even without the Gold Cup, Pulisic is at 58 games since the start of last August. His club teammate, Yunus Musah, would've broken the 55-match mark had he played this summer. Both of them have traveled over 85,000 kilometers (about 52,817 miles) this season between Milan's European matches and games in North America for the USMNT.

In the FIFPro report for last season, they compared a number of young players with their older compatriots. By his 25th birthday, Pulisic had made 338 club and national team appearances in his career. At the same point in his career, Donovan had played only 280 times. Here's the study's author:

"Pulisic, if not for injuries, would have an even greater distance, in terms of appearances, compared to Donovan. This is particularly evident between Pulisic's 21st and 22nd birthdays, where he missed numerous club and national team games due to a long-term ankle injury, COVID-19 and general illness. Overall, Pulisic's incredible number of appearances at such a young age has likely contributed to his worrisome injury record, having had the misfortune of missing close to 100 games since the 2017/2018 season through various injuries."

After the report was published, Pulisic played 58 more games for the USMNT and Milan.

There's a vision of a unified American soccer model -- a professionalized and well-defined way we play, where everyone is fully committed to the cause and developed within the same model. The players add up to something greater than the sum of the parts, and everything makes sense every time they take the field.

This will never happen. How do I know this? Because it hasn't happened anywhere else. You can't achieve this when all of your players are spending 75% of their time doing the same job for someone else. Although the situation arose by accident, the current constraints on the international game force it into dysfunction.

At the club level, teams get to target the players they want, and then they get to specify how they want to play on the training ground every day. They live in the same homes and play in front of the same fans, at the stadium, each week.

With the national team, you're limited by the quirks of birth years, national borders and citizenship rules. Your five best players might be goalkeepers, and there's nothing you can do about it. The squads are almost, by definition, ill-fitting, and then you have even less game and practice time for the coach and the players to figure out how the pieces best fit together. Oh, and then the roster changes almost every time the team convenes for a couple of matches and a few training sessions.

The players don't get paid anywhere near as much to play for the national team as they do for their clubs, and all of the matches either occur during "breaks" in the club season or at the end of the grueling European calendar. And as for the number of truly meaningful games these teams play every four years? You can count them on two hands.

Herculez Gomez reacts to the USMNT's "embarrassing" situation after Christian Pulisic hit back at critics.

As more and more Americans earn prominent roles in Europe, why should we expect this environment to produce anything other than drama, consternation and disappointment?

That is the reality for almost every major national team, most of the time.

Yes, Argentina is running hot right now, but it was the world's most depressing soap opera for the first 15 years of Messi's career. French fans hated how the team was playing pretty much until the final whistle in 2018, and it has as many World Cup wins as player mutinies. Spain looks great at the moment, but do you remember the last World Cup? When it was managed by Luis Enrique, the guy who just won the Champions League with PSG, and it got knocked out in the round of 16 after attempting over 1,000 passes and not scoring a goal?

Brazil has more raw talent than any nation not named France, and it has had four managers in the past two years. (Brazil is trying to win its first World Cup since 2002.) Italy hasn't qualified for a World Cup since 2014 or gotten out of the group stage since 2006. Germany seemed like it had cracked the code in 2014 -- and it hasn't been out of the group stage since. And England, well, England is home to the best soccer league in the world, and it has never won an international tournament that it didn't host.

All of which is to say: Every weird thing that's happening with the USMNT is normal. The expensive manager whom U.S. Soccer hired last year didn't immediately fix things because they never do. The players don't seem fully committed to their national team because no one is anymore. The former players are mad because soccer has already changed so much since they were playing.

However, the beauty of international soccer -- really, the thing that makes international soccer what it is -- is that next summer almost none of this will matter. Pulisic and Musah and Robinson won't save themselves for the next club season -- it's the World Cup, not the Gold Cup. And historically, the level of dysfunction in the lead-up to the tournament has almost no correlation with performance at the tournament.

In August 2022, Morocco was in way worse shape than the USMNT. It didn't have as much talent on its roster, it had lost in the quarterfinals at the Africa Cup of Nations, and despite qualifying for the World Cup, the federation fired its head coach, Vahid Halilhodzic, who dropped Chelsea star Hakim Ziyech from the team.

Four months later, Morocco was somewhere the USMNT would love to be next summer: playing in the World Cup semifinals.

Follow:


            There's a well-worn cliché in soccer: No player is bigger than the club.
    


            At the newly expanded FIFA Club World Cup on Thursday in Atlanta, with the event still in its infancy, that old saying was tossed to the side and replaced by a question on the lips of the 31,783 in attendance – can a player be bigger than the tournament?
    


            The soccer star in question, of course, was a certain Lionel Andrés Messi, for whom the masses had made their pilgrimage to worship, as his Inter Miami took on Portuguese giant FC Porto in the second matchday of Group A.
    


            But until a magical Messi moment in the 54th minute, the match was in danger of becoming a mere sideshow to supporters expressing their admiration – actually, more like unbridled passion – for the 37-year-old who has long cemented his status as one of the greats of the sport. And let's face it: winning nearly everything of note for Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain – as well as his country of Argentina, who is the reigning World Cup champion – doesn't exactly hurt his case.
    


            Ahead of kickoff outside Mercedes-Benz Stadium, it was evident how the pull of Messi knows no limits – or rather miles. While there were supporters from Atlanta in attendance, CNN Sports spoke with families from Louisiana, Alabama, Charleston, Washington DC, and Buffalo, as well as Puerto Rico and Dublin, Ireland.
    


            They had made the journey for one reason, despite one fan doing his best to convince all in earshot, including himself, that “we are here for the football!” Inside, when Messi was introduced 30 minutes ahead of kickoff, the roar from the fairly sparse crowd resembled an environment more in keeping with a sold out stadium.
    


            It went up a couple of notches when he walked out again to a fuller house, as the players made their individual entrances to the field, seemingly a nod towards the Americanization of the sport – as FIFA President Gianni Infantino told CNN Sports' Coy Wire recently, this tournament will deliver “63 Super Bowls in one month.”
    


            Upon kickoff, with seemingly every touch of the ball from the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, the sounds from the stands ranged from “ooh's” to whistles, with the “Me-ssi!” chant the most popular. It was bordering on surprising that the crowd didn't serenade the Argentine with a chorus of “Happy Birthday” given the Barça legend turns 38 on Tuesday.
    


            The match was a slow-burner, but exploded into life in the second half. Inter Miami found itself a goal down at the break, courtesy of an early penalty from Porto's Samu Aghehowa.
    


            After the spot kick was converted, Messi's reaction from near the center circle was to keep his hand firmly on his hip and not move a muscle for a good 10 seconds in a manner which suggested: “This wasn't the plan.” Perhaps, then, it was Porto which didn't plan on Inter Miami's rapid response.
    


            Just two minutes into the second half, Telasco Segovia's smart finish flew past goalkeeper Cláudio Ramos to level the score, and seven minutes later, Messi stepped up. In every way.
    


            A free kick on the edge of the box, which the Argentine star won, brought the crowd to the edge of their seats. A sense of inevitability hung in the air as the maestro marked his territory and figured out the exact angle to place a whipped shot into the corner of the net. You almost had to feel for Ramos, who couldn't lay a glove on either strike.
    


            The goal was a thing of beauty, as we have been treated to so frequently over the years, with Portuguese defender José Fonte lauding Messi on the DAZN broadcast: “Touched by God, isn't he? Incredible. What a player.” The stunner ended up not just being the match winner but resulted in the first time a team from the CONCACAF region has defeated a European side in a competitive fixture.
    


            It was Messi's 50th goal for the team as well. Not too shabby for a Thursday afternoon in the middle of June. A point in the final group game against Brazilian outfit Palmeiras next Monday will guarantee Inter Miami's place in the knockout phase.
    


            Cutting through the noise and one wonders what the powers at be in FIFA make of it all. The sport's governing body essentially fast-tracked Inter Miami into the 32-team tournament, not by virtue of winning the MLS Cup, but rather the regular season Supporters' Shield, which may have come with a trophy, but is ultimately a pathway into the postseason.
    


            Messi and Miami were shockingly bounced last year in a best-of-three playoff series by the team which can normally be found playing at this stunning 70,000-capacity stadium, Atlanta United, with the MLS Cup eventually hoisted aloft by LA Galaxy. But the Seattle Sounders and LAFC completed the contingent of the three MLS sides in the Club World Cup, leaving the Galaxy on the outside looking in, gazing enviously at the brightest star of them all.
    


            And with the Club World Cup finally finding its feet, thanks to Messi's left foot resulting in one of the tournament's first signature moments, the reality remains that he is what has drawn the crowds here on Thursday, and last Saturday to boot, with the opening game of the tournament attracting over 60,000 fans to Hard Rock Stadium in Messi's American base of Miami.
    


            Inter Miami is a relatively new MLS franchise, with co-owner David Beckham – who may have felt a modicum of sympathy for his former club, the LA Galaxy, not getting an invite to FIFA's party – the original reason for this franchise gaining relevance in 2018.
    


            Whether the Club World Cup – which is set to take place every four years, the same cycle as the slightly more established FIFA World Cup, which will be 96 years old next summer – can grow in stature remains to be seen. In the here and now, Messi and Messi alone is on the mind of everyone fortunate enough to witness him in action. And that extends to the players as well.
    


            When CNN Sports speaks with Messi's teammate Fafà Picault after the match, the three words the winger associates with the soccer superstar are ”leader, winner, and winner again,” before noting, “Sometimes, it's not always said with words but just with signals and body actions, so we try to read off of that. Obviously, we have conversations behind doors, but there's a lot more than just talking that can show signs of leadership.”
    


            And on Thursday, Lionel Messi's actions spoke far louder than words.

Bayern Munich striker says he expects intimidating atmosphere 

Kane ready for physical battle with Argentine side in Miami

Harry Kane had an early taste of the great American outdoors ahead of next summer's World Cup as Bayern Munich's plane to Miami was delayed by Florida thunder storms ahead of Friday's game against Boca Juniors at the Hard Rock Stadium.

On arrival Kane was still his familiar mild and temperate self in response to repeated questions, mainly from the Argentinian press, about the volatility of the reception he can expect from Boca's fans, who have been the most vivid spectacle of the Club World Cup so far.

“The Boca fans are obviously loud and they're passionate,” said Kane. “A big part of their game is to have the fans behind them, to use them as the energy and to take them into tackles and to battle. Their fans are going to be passionate. They're going to be trying to push their team to win the game. So, yeah, I'm looking forward to the atmosphere. You know, sometimes it brings out the best in you as a player.”

Kane is also prepared for the physical battle the Boca defenders will offer. Boca's tournament opener against Benfica was marked by concussive challenges, three red cards and a distinctive style of heavy-contact defending,

“It's going to be heated, it's going to be hot, it's going to be a physical game. And they have some quality players as well, so we need to be ready for that. We have to be ready for the battle tomorrow. They're a team who like to like to battle, like to make it difficult, like to counter press the opponent. We need to be ready for that.

“To be honest, I've not played against many South American teams in my career so far. So I think any game, any new team you play, is another experience. It's hard to really say how the game is going to go tomorrow, but like I said, I know they'll be very passionate, very hungry to get the result.

“There's a lot of top quality teams all around the world. It's not just Europe where football is played and you see that at national level as well. So it doesn't surprise me that some of the teams who are maybe not looked upon as some of the favourites, are doing well in this tournament. I don't think any anyone needs to be taken lightly.”

AUSTIN, Texas (June 19, 2025) — The U.S. Men's National Team overcame a gritty Saudi Arabia side 1-0 in the Concacaf Gold Cup Group Stage second match on a warm, humid night at Q2 Stadium.

Defender Chris Richards broke the deadlock in the 63rd minute on a sliding short strike off a set piece free kick. Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter assisted Richard with a perfectly-arched pass from the right side. Berhalter, in just his third National Team appearance, recorded his first assist. Richards tallied his second goal in his 27th cap. Richards' first score also came in Concacaf competition in the 2023 Nations League Final against Canada.

The USA advanced the quarterfinal with the win and Haiti's draw versus Trinidad and Tobago. The Americans head to Arlington, Texas, sitting at the top of Group D. They'll face Haiti to round out group play at AT&T Stadium on Sunday, June 22 at 7 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. CT (FOX, TUDN, ViX; SiriusXM FC, FDP Radio).

Neither team could find the goal in the first half. Both squads finished the first 45 with two shots each and one on target. Richards making his third start of the year, helped hold Saudi scoreless with an impressive sliding block after a Green Falcon caught the U.S. off guard on a breakaway.

Saudi Arabia's aggressive defense challenged the U.S. for much of the first half. The Al-Suqour played a 4-3-3 in contrast to Trinidad and Tobago's deep 5-3-2 formation. The U.S. set up in the same 4-2-3-1 with the same starting lineup.

The U.S. attack improved in the second half as the Americans finished the game with five shots, three on goal. The Americans also dominated time of possession 67% compared to 33%.

Mexico and Costa Rica in Group A also punched their tickets to the knockout round. Group B and Group C resume play tomorrow to determine more of the quarterfinal field, with the Group stage round ending June 24. The quarterfinals will commence June 28-29 from State Farm Stadium and U.S. Bank Stadium.

USA — CHRIS RICHARDS (SEBASTIAN BERHALTER), 63rd minute: Earning a free kick, the U.S. played a set piece to create the scoring opportunity. Berhalter took the kick from the right side and launched the ball toward the goal where Richards connected on a short sliding kick with his right foot.

Don't Miss

The FIFA Club World Cup is just six days old, but it has already provided a mixed bag of memorable experiences for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, whose trip to Southern California with Paris Saint-Germain marked his first visit to the U.S.

“I was in shock,” the veteran winger said. “It's very beautiful here. I like it very much. One day we [went] bowling. And played mini golf. I was thinking when I finish football, to come to live.”

Then there's the soccer, where not all the memories have been good ones.

After contributing two assists to a win in PSG's tournament opener, Kvaratskhelia was unable to get any of his game-high five shots past goalkeeper John Victor in Thursday's 1-0 loss to Brazilian club Botafogo before an announced crowd of 53,699 at the Rose Bowl.

Inter Milan plays to a 1-1 draw with Monterrey in the FIFA Club World Cup, yet another tournament in an increasingly busy schedule for players and teams.

The upset, the tournament's most shocking result so far, snapped PSG's win streak at six games in all competition, marked the first time it has been held scoreless since March 5 and leaves in doubt the team's spot in the second round. Botafogo (2-0) leads the four-team group with PSG and Atlético Madrid (both 1-1) tied for second with a game remaining. With just two teams moving on, PSG will need a victory over the Sounders on Monday in Seattle to advance.

A draw would also send it through if Atlético Madrid loses its final group-stage match with Botafogo.

It wasn't supposed to be this hard for PSG, the reigning French and European champion and a heavy pre-tournament favorite. Botafogo, which won last year's Copa Libertadores, is the reigning South American champion, but it is just eighth in Brazil's 20-team Serie A 11 matches into the current season.

Whether Thursday's upset helps the struggling Club World Cup find an audience, it's far too early to tell. But it can't hurt, especially since Inter Miami also made history Thursday with a second-half goal from Lionel Messi in a 2-1 win over FC Porto, marking the first victory by an MLS club over a European rival in a competitive match.

The Club World Cup is the largest and most lucrative global club competition in soccer history but attendance has lagged in the early going, averaging just 36,433 through 20 matches. Nearly half the seats have been empty.

Six games have drawn more than 50,000 fans, including both of Paris Saint-Germain's matches at the Rose Bowl. But two got fewer than 5,300, with just 3,412 showing up in Orlando for a game between South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns and South Korea's Ulsan HD and 5,282 for Pachuca-RB Salzburg at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati.

And that's despite the fact that FIFA, alarmed at the slow pace of ticket sales, slashed prices on the eve of the tournament.

“The atmosphere was a bit strange,” Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said after his team beat LAFC in its tournament opener before nearly 50,000 empty seats at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium. “This is a world tournament. It deserves more.”

Paris Saint-Germain defeats Atlético Madrid in its FIFA Club World Cup opener at the Rose Bowl, but expanding its fan base in the U.S. will be an even bigger win.

That the competition hasn't produced more interest is largely FIFA's fault. World soccer's governing body has been unable to convince fans or players that the tournament — a 32-team, month-long competition wedged between the end of one European season and the start of the next — was necessary, or even desired.

And until Thursday the tournament had produced little real excitement, with three of the first nine matches — including the opener featuring Messi and Inter Miami — ending in scoreless draws while Bayern Munich, ranked sixth in the world in the Opta Power Rankings, beat Auckland City, ranked 5,068 places lower, 10-0.

With many games kicking off at midday or in the early afternoon, the hot and sticky summer weather has also been a factor on both the play and the attendance. Powerful Real Madrid, playing with Kylian Mbappe in 89-degree temperatures and 71% humidity in suburban Miami, struggled to a draw against Saudi club Al-Hilal while Atlético Madrid wilted under bright summer skies at the Rose Bowl in its first game.

“Playing in this heat is impossible,” Atlético's Marcos Llorente told reporters. “The heat is terrible. My toes hurt, even my toenails.

At a time when many other professional sports teams in Los Angeles are staying silent amid ICE raids, Angel City is using its platform to support immigrants.

“No one in Europe is used to it. I couldn't stop or start running. It's unbelievable, but since it's the same for everyone there's no point complaining.”

It will be no cooler next year when the real World Cup returns to North America for the first time in 32 years. And in that sense, this summer's tournament is making good on one of its aims by exposing national team players to the kind of weather, travel and atmosphere they can expect then.

“We're going to come prepared next year,” said Inter Milan's Marcus Thuram, who played in the 2022 World Cup final for France. “It's good preparation to manage the jet lag. America is very big. You get can a taste of what you will get next year. It's a great preparation.”

As for Thursday's game, Kvaratskhelia, PSG's most dangerous attacker, was frustrated twice in the first 10 minutes, with Victor batting down his first shot and the second curling wide of the far post. That allowed Igor Jesus to put Botafogo in front to stay shortly before the intermission, splitting a pair of PSG defenders to run on to Jefferson Savarino's perfectly weighted through ball, then beating keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from the top of the box.

Members of the Italian soccer team Juventus visited President Trump in the Oval Office. A team spokesperson later said the visit ‘carried no political agenda.'

It was the first goal PSG has allowed in 366 minutes in all competition and it was all Botafogo would need, although Savarino nearly doubled the lead eight minutes into the second half, putting a strong header on goal that Donnarumma batted down.

Bradley Barcola appeared to tie the score in the 79th minute, but two PSG players were well offside on the play. Then on the first touch of stoppage time, Kvaratskhelia sent a free kick just over the crossbar.

PSG dominated statistically, controlling the ball for three-quarters of the game, making more than three times as many passes, taking 10 corners to one for the Brazilians and outshooting Botafogo 16-4. But all four of Botafogo's shots were on target while Victor was called on to make just two saves.

Don't Miss

The FIFA Club World Cup is just six days old, but it has already provided a mixed bag of memorable experiences for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, whose trip to Southern California with Paris Saint-Germain marked his first visit to the U.S.

“I was in shock,” the veteran winger said. “It's very beautiful here. I like it very much. One day we [went] bowling. And played mini golf. I was thinking when I finish football, to come to live.”

Then there's the soccer, where not all the memories have been good ones.

After contributing two assists to a win in PSG's tournament opener, Kvaratskhelia was unable to get any of his game-high five shots past goalkeeper John Victor in Thursday's 1-0 loss to Brazilian club Botafogo before an announced crowd of 53,699 at the Rose Bowl.

Alejandro Moreno breaks down how Lionel Messi and his Inter Miami side were able to beat Porto in the Club World Cup. (2:33)

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is off and running, and has produced plenty of talking points and storylines already. Let's catch you up on what's happening, what you've missed and what's still to come.

We will update this file throughout each matchday with the latest reporting, analysis and fun from the competition, so check back regularly for the latest news as we follow the fun leading up to the tournament final at MetLife Stadium on July 13.

ATLANTA -- The familiar "Messi, Messi, Messi" chants echoed throughout Mercedes-Benz Stadium as Lionel Messi set up the ball just outside the box for a free kick in the 54th minute of the match. Fans sang in unison, briefly stopping when the Inter Miami captain stepped toward the ball. Silence took hold in the stands before crowds erupted into cheers after Messi's 68th career direct free kick for club and country.

His remarkable set-piece goal gave Inter Miami a 2-1 lead they didn't give up as the Major League Soccer side completed a famous victory over FC Porto to fully ignite their Club World Cup campaign.

It was a game of firsts for Inter Miami: It was their first win in the 2025 Club World Cup after failing to score in the inaugural match against Al Ahly, and conceding an early penalty by Porto in the first half. It was also the first win by a Concacaf team over a European team in FIFA international club competitions, the confederation going 0-3-10 (W-D-L) prior to Thursday's clash in Atlanta.

The free kick was also Messi's 50th goal for Inter Miami in 61 games, reaching the half-century faster than he did for Barcelona (119 appearances) or the Argentina national team (107 appearances).

In the lead-up to the Club World Cup, many wondered if Messi and the other former Barcelona veterans (Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, Luis Suárez) could live up to the pressure and level of European clubs as they once did in LaLiga. Messi admitted to having different expectations of this tournament than when he competed in the earlier editions of the Club World Cup with Barcelona.

"Having the chance to be part of it is exciting," Messi said to FIFA. "The expectations I have are different to the ones I had when I played for other teams, but I'm eager and I look forward to competing against the best [teams] and doing well."

But the Argentine forward, who is 37, showed signs of his classic self in the second half against Porto, weaving through defenders and reading the game perfectly in helping Miami to victory. His brilliant finish came barely seven minutes after Telasco Segovia (who was impressive in midfield) leveled for Miami in a bright start to the second half, rifling a first-time finish into the top corner from Marcelo Weigandt's low right-wing cross.

The win gives Inter Miami a chance to advance to the knockout round of the competition, the indicator of success set up by head coach Javier Mascherano and co-owner Jorge Mas. In that push, Messi is the driving force for Inter Miami's success in any competition, the team clearly leaning on his magic whenever possible.

No stage is too big for Messi, regardless of the color or badge on his jersey.

"I told my guys, just be a team. Enjoy. Attack together, defend together, and enjoy," Botafogo manager Renato Paiva said he told his players before strolling on the Rose Bowl field Thursday night. The message was simple: Worry less about the outcome, and focus on being in the moment and working together against a Paris Saint-Germain side that won 44 games, drew eight and lost eight (all competitions) last season on its way to a domestic treble (Ligue 1, Trophee des Champions, Coupe de France) and its first Champions League title.

In the end, the collective effort couldn't be denied as Igor Jesus' first-half goal on the counterattack set the stage for a stunning 1-0 Botafogo victory to give this tournament its first shocking result.

Few expected PSG to find much resistance until the latter stages of this competition, given their dominant form and stacked lineup, led by Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (five shots), Vitinha (a game-high 134 completed passes), Achraf Hakimi and Desire Doue. And yet, Botafogo weathered all the pressure and scored with 10 minutes left in the first half, Jesus latching on to Jefferson Savarino's through-ball, fending off Willian Pacho and firing a deflected effort beyond Gianluigi Donnarumma and into the bottom corner for a stunning lead.

The onslaught continued after the break in front of a hectic Rose Bowl crowd (attendance: 53,699), but Botafogo did as Paiva demanded, defending together and enjoying the energy of every intercepted pass or defensive clearance. Despite having nearly 75% possession and peppering the Botafogo box with the ball, PSG couldn't crack through. Victor made two particularly impressive saves in a superb performance between the posts, denying Kvaratskhelia early and then preventing Gonzalo Ramos' close-range effort five minutes into the second half.

Botafogo's 4-1-4-1 formation helped kettle PSG into crowded areas of the pitch and hurry them into bad decisions. Veteran defender Alexander Barboza (three blocks, nine clearances, one interception) held firm, while the midfield pair of Marlon Freitas and Gregore applied constant pressure on PSG to deny them clear sight of goal, with the European champions managing just two shots on frame.

The Club World Cup needed a day like Thursday to pique a wider interest, with Inter Miami and Botafogo upsetting much-fancied opponents to introduce some volatility heading into the final round of games for Group A and Group B, respectively. Up next, PSG should roll past a Seattle Sounders FC side that's all but playing for pride, while Botafogo should fancy their chances against an Atletico Madrid side that's still a work in progress. -- James Tyler

MIAMI -- You've paid hundreds of dollars for tickets, and you're excited to take your family to watch the club you support play a competitive match, against a top team, at home in the United States. But the game is kicking off at midday in June at the storied Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., a stadium where there's no roof to protect the crowd from the sun.

Many fans who attended Sunday's game between Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid have spoken out about the conditions, complaining about the heat, long lines for refreshments, and limited access to water.

"It was uncomfortable," Jonathan Nettler, who attended the game with his wife and 12-year-old twin sons, told ESPN. "It definitely lessened the experience. My wife and boys had to leave the bowl several times during the game to find shade and get a respite. But we survived."

A reported 80,619 fans attended the match, the most at the Club World Cup so far. Players and both coaches criticized the noon local kickoff time, with PSG's Luis Enrique saying the game was "clearly impacted" by the heat.

"We spent most of the second half on a crusade for sunscreen, food and souvenirs," Nettler told ESPN. "We didn't have problems getting drinks. But my wife stepped out of a food line to help an older woman who felt faint. And she said she saw two instances of kids on stretchers being assisted by medical services."

Despite all that, Nettler and his family are back at the Rose Bowl on Thursday for PSG vs. Botafogo. "We're hoping we'll be able to enjoy the game more, as they're predicting lower temperatures, and the game starts at 6 p.m.," he said. "It's not a surprise that summer in the U.S. is hot. I'm sure the teams that tour here annually are familiar with it. But the midday start times are unusual, and extra-challenging."

A FIFA spokesperson told ESPN that "FIFA's top priority is the health of everyone involved in football," saying the organization had "deployed venue medical officers, who work in close cooperation with the local medical authorities to address key health matters, including heat management." Fans could bring empty, transparent, reusable plastic bottles into venues, the spokesperson said, and FIFA would "continue to monitor the weather conditions... to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience." -- Alex Kirkland

Botafogo's head coach Renato Paiva likes to say: "The soccer's cemetery is full of favourites." Thursday night at the Rose Bowl was just that, as Botafogo, the Copa Libertadores champions, won a game for the ages against PSG. Igor Jesus, who will join Premier League side Nottingham Forest after the FIFA Club World Cup, decided another game for Fogão with an impressive goal on the break.

Pavia's side wrapped up the first victory for a South American club over a European club in 13 years. The last one? Corinthians over Chelsea in 2012.

Thursday night saw a game that will not be forgotten for many years. Can they do it again? -- Antônio Chamorro, ESPN Brazil

EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey -- After a slow start, Palmeiras took off in the second half and beat Al Ahly 2-0 at MetLife Stadium in the Group A second round of the FIFA Club World Cup. The crowd was again a talking point. Only 35,179 fans attended, according to the officials, despite the stadium, which will be one of the venues for the 2026 World Cup, having 85,500 seats, but the game still provided plenty to unpack for both sides.

The Brazilian team withstood the "heat" from the Egyptians (and the thermometer, with temperatures in the high 80s with intense humidity) in the first half. After the break, coach Abel Ferreira made some smart changes, with substitute striker Flaco López deciding the game.

During a match that was interrupted for 45 minutes because of a "severe weather alert" in the area, Flaco made the difference. First, he disrupted Ahly's defense during a set piece and pressured center forward Abou Ali to score an own goal, opening the scoring. Shortly after, López received a perfect assist from Maurício in a potent counterattack and scored to settle the encounter.

BOCA RATON, Fla. -- One of the quirks of the global FIFA tournaments is players being asked unexpected questions.

After his man-of-the-match performance in Man City's 2-0 win over Wydad AC on Wednesday, Phil Foden was excitedly asked by one reporter for his thoughts about Brazilian football. Foden laughed and threw it back to the reporter. "What do you think of Brazilian football?" was his tongue-in-cheek response, before complimenting the "flair" of South American teams.

Foden appeared dejected when he talked to reporters at Wembley in May after the FA Cup final, but he looked far more comfortable and content in the mixed zone at Lincoln Financial Field. After training in Florida on Thursday morning, the England midfielder was all smiles as he posed for a picture sitting on a Boca Raton police motorcycle. It appears that taking a break rather than playing in England's June internationals has done him good. -- Rob Dawson

PHILADELPHIA, Penn. -- Cole Palmer is a man of few words, but those words are usually compelling.

Speaking to reporters at Philadelphia Union's Subaru Park on Thursday -- where Chelsea are training for the next week -- the 23-year-old ended a mystery that began when the Blues arrived in the United States.

Palmer was pictured getting off the plane in Atlanta with a mask. Why was he wearing it? Was he ill? Was he protecting himself from a possible COVID outbreak? Blues boss Enzo Maresca thought he might have been doing it as a joke. Finally, Palmer revealed why.

"It wasn't a joke: I just don't like the smelly planes," Palmer said. "That's why I wear a mask. When I travel, I don't like the smells so that's why I wear them. It's stuff like that, nothing else. [Maresca] doesn't know: I didn't tell him, but he didn't ask me, to be fair."

Palmer will be grateful that Chelsea's final two Group D games are in Philadelphia and won't require additional travel. But if Chelsea win Group D, their tournament path would run through Miami and Atlanta en route to East Rutherford; if they finish second, they'd face a round of 16 game in Charlotte, North Carolina, before heading north once more. -- James Olley

LOS ANGELES -- Monterrey captain Sergio Ramos worked out at the team hotel Thursday away from his teammates, who trained on the pitch under the direction of coach Domenec Torrent. The former Spanish international successfully completed a recovery session in the morning to be 100% ready for the second group stage match of the Club World Cup against River Plate. -- Ricardo Cariño, ESPN Mexico

Inter Miami have kept Messi fresh throughout his time in South Florida so that he could deliver in the big moments, and Thursday's come-from-behind win over Portuguese giants FC Porto wouldn't have happened without the Argentine. He kept finding ways to get on the ball and impact the game, drawing the foul from Rodrigo Mora and winning the free-kick he curled into the top corner beyond a helpless Claudio Ramos.

Big moments require big players, and big players require big moments. On Thursday, Messi unquestionably delivered. -- Tyler

Odds (via ESPN BET): Benfica (N/A), Draw (+3800), Auckland City FC (+10000)

The Portuguese side showed resolve and canny to rally from a one-goal deficit and a man down (after Andrea Belotti's aggression that earned a red card) for a credible draw, thanks to Nicolas Otamendi's late set-piece header. They will expect to pressure the semi-pro side from New Zealand early and often, though they will struggle to come close to Bayern Munich's double-digit showing in Auckland City's first game.

Expect the front three of Bruma, Vangelis Pavlidis and Angel Di Maria to play well, and they'll need to for a spot in the round of 16. After all, Boca Juniors will know what scoreline they need to match if they're to advance. -- Tyler

Odds: Flamengo (+280), Draw (+250), Chelsea (-110)

The top two sides in Group D face off in Philadelphia for a match that will, in all likelihood, decide who finishes in top spot. Flamengo and Chelsea meet in a competitive game for the first time -- their previous meeting in a friendly was 27 years ago -- but there are more recent links between the clubs.

Flamengo are managed by Filipe Luis, who made 26 appearances for Chelsea in 2014-15, and Jorginho signed for the Brazilian club this summer after leaving Stamford Bridge for Arsenal in 2023. Chelsea beat LAFC in a sparsely populated stadium in Atlanta, but more than 50,000 fans are expected in Philly this time. -- Olley

Odds: LAFC (-115), Draw (+240), Esperance de Tunis (+340)

LAFC desperately need a victory after falling 2-0 against Chelsea in their inaugural match of the Club World Cup. Denis Bouanga and Jeremy Ebobisse must connect in attack if they're to have a chance of advancing out of Group D.

Though Bouanga had 43 touches and three shots on goal throughout 90 minutes, Chelsea limited Ebobisse to no attempts while on the pitch for the first half. Head coach Steve Cherundolo might look to start experienced forward Olivier Giroud this time, attempting a new strategy against Esperance de Tunis.

With the Tunisian side also starting their tournament with a defeat to Flamengo, it's a must-win for both sides. -- Becherano

Odds: Bayern Munich (-550), Draw (+550), Boca Juniors (+950)

Edinson Cavani is doubtful for Boca Juniors, who will be without Ander Herrera and Nicolas Figal, both of whom were sent off against Benfica. Bayern might rotate given the likely conditions in Miami Gardens, and a Boca side that is expected to be more physical than Auckland City in the opener. That could mean a start for Joao Palhinha in the middle of the pitch, possibly Leon Goretzka, too.

Harry Kane, who somehow didn't score in the opening day 10-0 win, will look to get off the mark. -- Marcotti

The U.S. men's national team clinched a spot in the knockout round of the Concacaf Gold Cup after a grind-it-out 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia in Austin, Texas, on Thursday, June 19.

The U.S. will close out group play on Sunday, June 22 against Haiti at AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas (7 p.m. ET, Fox).

Defender Chris Richards put in a "man of the match" performance, scoring the game's lone goal and circumventing a Saudi Arabia scoring threat in the first half.

"We needed tonight. It was a tough game against a tough opponent. Props to them," Richards told Fox Sports after the game. "But that's Concacaf for you. Sometimes you've got to get physical, sometimes you've got to get nasty, and that's exactly what we did tonight."

As expected, Saudi Arabia proved to be a much tougher opponent to break than Trinidad and Tobago, which the U.S. steamrolled 5-0 on Sunday, June 15. On Thursday night, it took until late in the first half for the U.S. to even manage a shot on goal. For their part, the U.S. was equally as stingy defensively, allowing just one shot on goal the entire game.

USA TODAY Sports provided updates and highlights for the Concacaf Gold Cup match between the USMNT and Saudi Arabia:

Tempers flared after Tyler Adams was pushed to the ground. Both Saudi Arabia manager Hervé Renard and U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino got involved as players from both teams got into a scrum.

Sebastian Berhalter was issued a yellow card, as were Saudi Arabia's Ziyad Al Johani and Abdulrahman Al Obud.

The USA-Saudi Arabia Gold Cup match finally had a breakthrough, as Chris Richards scored off a free kick from Sebastian Berhalter in the 63rd minute.

The play went to VAR, but Richards was ruled onside, giving the defender his second career USMNT goal.

The USMNT was not able to break down their disciplined opponents and make any threatening attempts on goal in the first half.

The U.S. enjoyed the majority of possession (72% to 28%), but did not get a shot on goal until late in the first half. In the 45th minute, Patrick Agyemang's header attempt was on goal, but Saudi Arabia 'keeper Nawaf Al Aqidi made an easy save.

Earlier in the first half, defender Chris Richards made the USMNT's best play of the game so far, thwarting a potential Saudi Arabia goal-scoring opportunity.

Haji Wright, who came on as a second-half substitute and scored a goal on June 15, is not with the U.S. team for Thursday night's game against Saudi Arabia. Wright is dealing with an Achilles issue.

The Concacaf Gold Cup group stage game pairing the USMNT with Saudi Arabia is set for 9:15 p.m. ET at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas. Q2 Stadium is the regular home of Austin FC of Major League Soccer.

Mauricio Pochettino is going with the same starting 11 as the U.S. featured in Sunday's win over Trinidad and Tobago.

For Sebastian Berhalter and Alex Freeman, the start against Saudi Arabia represents a third national team cap for each player.

Saudi Arabia is coming off a 1-0 win over Haiti in its Gold Cup opener. The goal scorer from that win, Saleh Al-Shehri, starts this game on the bench. Forward Firas Al-Buraikan (known as Feras) is the team's most-capped active player (52).

Concacaf announced in December 2024 that Saudi Arabia would participate in the 2025 and 2027 Gold Cup tournaments. This announcement came shortly after Saudi Arabia was selected as the host nation for the 2034 World Cup.

Saudi Arabia is the eighth different non-Concacaf affiliated nation to be invited to compete in the Gold Cup. Other invited teams include Brazil (1996, 1998 and 2003), Colombia (2000, 2003 and 2005), South Korea (2000 and 2002), Peru (2000), Ecuador (2002), South Africa (2005) and Qatar (2021 and 2023).

The Gold Cup is a biennial tournament for national teams in the North and Central American and Caribbean region associated with Concacaf. Mexico (nine times), the U.S. (seven times) and Canada (one time) are the only nations to have won the Gold Cup. Mexico won the last Gold Cup competition in 2023.

The United States has advanced to the quarterfinals of 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup after beating Saudi Arabia 1-0 in Austin, Texas. 

Chris Richards scored the lone goal in Thursday's win as the USMNT grinded out a win against a tough Saudi Arabian side on a warm Thursday night. 

The win puts the USMNT in a great spot to win Group D outright on Sunday against Haiti in Arlington, Texas. 

Here were the game's best moments and highlights:

...

For most of 90 sleepy minutes Thursday night in Austin, Texas, a U.S. men's national team littered with reserves probed and plodded. In their second Gold Cup group stage match, against a Saudi Arabia B-team, a makeshift squad of American fringe players suggested that they aren't quite ready for the international level.

But in the 31st and 63rd minutes, one of a few exceptions, Chris Richards, saved the day. He led the U.S. to a 1-0 win, and to the Gold Cup knockout rounds. He also showed why he's a nailed-on starter at next summer's World Cup.

First, at the end of a 30-yard lung-busting sprint, Richards kept the U.S. goal unscathed in heroic fashion, with a lunging block, denying the Saudis their best chance of the game.

"That is what we want," U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino said of the tackle. "That is what we expect."

And then, with the teams droning toward a 0-0 draw, Richards scored the evening's only goal off a set piece:

The 1-0 win sent the U.S. through to the Gold Cup quarterfinals, likely atop Group D. There, in the knockout rounds, is where the fun — and the tougher tests — will begin, either against Costa Rica or Mexico.

Here, in the group stage, was an opportunity for this depleted USMNT to put a rough pre-Gold Cup stretch behind them. But on Sunday, for the most part, they thudded back down to their underwhelming pre-tournament levels.

The USMNT rode comfortably into Q2 Stadium, having relieved pressure and quieted noise with a 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago in its opener.

Then it played comfortably. And for about 15 or 20 minutes, that was a good thing. It bossed possession, snuffed out all Saudi threats in transition, and established its attacking shape high up the field.

But, once in that shape, the Americans did nothing. They were too slow, too safe, too predictable — with their passing and off-ball movement. They were too narrow, and the two players who did spend most of the first half wide — Max Arfsten and Jack McGlynn — did nothing incisive or creative. (They are, after all, a fullback and a central midfielder, respectively.)

They raised questions about Pochettino's game model. But when Pochettino looked down the bench to find someone who could inject life into the U.S. attack, he saw … Brenden Aaronson, Paxten Aaronson and Quinn Sullivan. He typically has two international-level wingers, Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah, but one of the two is resting; the other is with Juventus at the Club World Cup (and, last night, the White House).

So, there was hardly any vertical running. There was hardly any purposeful dribbling or passing. There were a few teasing crosses from Arfsten, McGlynn and Malik Tillman; but through 40 minutes, the U.S. had just one shot, none on target, and 0.03 Expected Goals.

And eventually, Saudi Arabia took advantage of the USMNT's blandness. It broke out into a few counterattacks. In the 31st minute, the U.S. left Abdulrahman Al Obud all alone on the left wing. He strode into the box, and into a shot, which was blocked by a flying Richards.

Patrick Agyemang finally registered the USMNT's first shot on target, with a tame header, in the 45th minute. But for the most part, he was sloppy. Neither Tillman nor Diego Luna could really get into the game. The teams went to halftime at 0-0.

Only a set piece, it seemed, could wake up the game. And before long, one did.

Eight minutes into the second half, Richards got free on a corner, but nodded his header right down the goalkeeper's gut.

A few minutes later, Saudi Arabia carved up the U.S. on a counter, and struck the crossbar — though the offside flag was up.

And a few minutes after that, Richards delivered. He latched onto Sebastian Berhalter's inswinging free kick. He airplaned away in celebration.

Of the 11 starters on Thursday — Matt Freese, Richards, Tim Ream, Arfsten, Alex Freeman, Berhalter, Luca de la Torre, Luna, Tillman, McGlynn, Agyemang — Richards is the only World Cup lock. And after an impressive season at Crystal Palace in England, he is one of the few U.S. players rising toward their unmissable moment in 2026.

He is emerging as a leader, a consistent presence with a dynamic personality, and one that the USMNT can rally around as next summer approaches.

And, "the most important [thing]," Pochettino said, is that he's "so humble. That is what I like the most. He arrives [at camp], and always is very open to learn."

Briton into world's top four after win over Nakashima

Carlos Alcaraz beats Arthur Rinderknech 7-5, 6-4

Jack Draper is a perfectionist in every sense of the word, which means that for the third consecutive match he departed the court quite unimpressed by the level of tennis he demonstrated. There were, after all, quite a few self-sabotaging concentration lapses, his forehand was too erratic and he did not always seem comfortable moving on the slick grass.

In the most important moments, however, when the match hung in the balance, the 23-year-old locked in and produced his best tennis. Once again, the British No 1 held his nerve in the final stages of a tough three-setter as he defeated Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals at Queen's Club for the first time in his career.

The victory means Draper will return to his career-high ranking of No 4 on Monday, securing him a top-four seeding at Wimbledon. At a time when almost every player wishes to avoid an early meeting with Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner, he cannot face either of the world's top two before the semi-finals.

However, a meeting with Alcaraz here remains on the cards. One day after his own dramatic three-set win, as he recovered from 2-4 in the final set to defeat Jaume Munar in a three hour, 26-minute marathon, Alcaraz, the top seed, returned to the semi-finals at Queen's Club with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Arthur Rinderknech. Alcaraz has won 16 consecutive matches, the longest winning streak of his career.

Alcaraz stressed how difficult it was to recover with less than 24 hours after such a tough match. “Could be better, honestly, but I thought I was going to feel much worse than I feel right now,” the world No 2 said. “But we are tennis players, we have to do whatever we have to do just to recover, to be in good shape the next day. I'm just feeling great. I'm glad that today was one hour, 20 minutes. Today was more grass [than clay], so I'm just happy and hopefully tomorrow I'm going to feel much better.”

For Draper the past few days have, in some ways, emphasised just how much things have changed over the past year. Although he has broken new ground this week by reaching a first semi-final at this venue, he still feels some way from producing his best. “The level of what I'm playing could be more consistent, definitely better,” he said. “I think it will come. The more I practise, the more I play, I'm getting a little bit better each time. I don't know when it will come together, but still doing well to be in the semis. Day by day, we'll see.

While he has previously been able to produce his best level from the beginning of the grass season, Draper is still finding his feet after enduring his first full clay-court season and the significant efforts it took for him to adapt his game to suit a completely different surface.

“It's just such a hard adjustment,” said Draper. “I really tried on the clay to play a certain way, to be aggressive in the back court, to be tough from the back of the court, and I spent probably like a month and a half on the clay.

This is still [early] because I didn't practise too much before the tournament with certain things. I'm sort of going by ear out there a little bit, and I'm trying to become more and more comfortable on the grass. When you get more comfortable in the movement, more comfortable in what you're trying to do out there, it just starts clicking.”

During the decisive moments, though, the confidence that Draper has gained over the past few years has been plain for all to see and every match affords him the opportunity to further improve his level on grass as he attempts to peak in time for Wimbledon. Draper will next face the talented Czech Jiri Lehecka, who ended the excellent run of the British No 2, Jacob Fearnley, with a 7-5, 6-2 win.

Elsewhere, the world No 1, Jannik Sinner, released his first music single, Polvere e Gloria (Dust and Glory), with the famous Italian vocalist Andrea Bocelli. Alongside Bocelli's singing, Sinner reiterates parts of his past speeches during trophy ceremonies. On Thursday, the same day the song was announced, Sinner suffered his first defeat to a player ranked outside the top 20 in nearly two years, losing in three sets to Alexander Bublik in the second round of the Halle Open.

In Nottingham Katie Boulter's bid for a hat-trick of titles came to an end as she was beaten 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 by McCartney Kessler. The British No 2 and eighth seed secured a service break early in the deciding set but the American stormed back to reach the semi-finals.

With the grass-court season in full flow, players are ramping up their Wimbledon preparations.

Just days after Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner in a French Open classic, tennis switched over to the grass ahead of the year's third Grand Slam tournament.

Gabriel Diallo won the first title of his career in the Netherlands, while Taylor Fritz beat Alexander Zverev in the final of the Stuttgart Open.

This week, players are split across the Queen's Club Championships in London and the Halle Open in Germany.

Two players have stood out above the rest and could cause havoc at Wimbledon next month, entering the tournament without a seed next to their names.

Having the month of his life, Alexander Bublik backed up his run to the Roland Garros quarterfinals with another shock win in Halle.

Getting revenge on the world number one, who beat him in Paris, Bublik defeated Sinner in the second round of the Halle Open 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

Becoming the first player other than Alcaraz to beat Sinner since August 2024, Bublik proved just how dangerous he can be on grass courts.

If Bublik were to be unseeded at the All England Club, Sinner, Alcaraz, and the rest of the top ten will no doubt hope to avoid the Kazakh when the draw is released.

He may yet be seeded, though, as a title for Bublik in Halle would see him rise to world number 30.

Bublik will continue his search for a second Halle title in three years when he plays Tomas Machac in the quarterfinals on Friday, June 20.

The 28-year-old isn't the only player to have impressed, as Spain's Jaume Munar made the tennis world take notice on Thursday with his second-round performance at Queen's.

Dropping the first set to Alcaraz 4-6, few would've predicted Munar to launch a comeback, but he did just that, winning a marathon one-hour, 40-minute second set, 7-6 [9-7].

Despite leading his fellow Spaniard by a break in the decider, Munar was unable to hold on to the advantage, losing out in three sets, 4-6, 7-6, 5-7.

He may not have come away with the win, but Munar's level against Alcaraz was scarily good, something the top players in the men's game would be wise to take note of.

Unlike Bublik, Munar will 100% be unseeded at Wimbledon, and could be primed to cause an upset in the first round later this month.

Bublik and Munar have impressed on the grass this week, but how have they performed at the All England Club throughout their tennis careers?

The Kazakh star has yet to reach the quarterfinals in London, although he did come close in 2023, losing out in a fifth set to Andrey Rublev.

Winning 58% of his matches at SW19, Wimbledon is statistically Bublik's best Grand Slam tournament.

He'd no doubt love to improve upon his record in 2025, no matter who he is drawn against in the first round.

Munar, on the other hand, is still looking for a breakthrough at Wimbledon, having failed to win multiple matches at the event on his five previous visits.

In the Spaniard's defence, he has lost to some strong grass-court players over recent years, falling to Cameron Norrie, Lorenzo Musetti, and Alex de Minaur.

Perhaps Munar will take confidence from his strong showing against Alcaraz at Queen's and make a deep run at this year's tournament.

The 2025 Wimbledon tournament is scheduled to begin on Monday, June 30.

Some things in life come more naturally, and for Jiri Lehecka, grass-court tennis appears to be one of them.

After missing last year's grass swing due to a back injury, the Czech star may have approached this season's return to the surface with uncertainty. But rather than hesitating, Lehecka has silenced any doubts and surged to a significant milestone: his 100th tour-level victory.

“I always like to play on grass, I call it a real surface,” Lehecka told ATPTour.com at the HSBC Championships in London, where he is into the semi-finals. “It's something you really look forward to the whole year, it's something special.

“I didn't know what to expect from myself at the beginning of last week. It was my first match on grass in two years… Adjusting to grass for me is not that hard because it fits my style. I have the game to play on grass, and the surface helps my game be even more effective.”







There has been a quiet confidence around Lehecka's return to grass this year. After reaching the quarter-finals in Stuttgart last week, he has captured the attention of the west London crowd at Queen's Club, where he is into the last four without dropping a set.
Armed with blistering groundstrokes off both wings and an explosive first serve, Lehecka's game translates seamlessly to grass. He first made waves on the surface with a memorable run to the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2023 before he was forced to retire against Daniil Medvedev.
Yet even before that, Lehecka's affinity for SW19 was clear: He captured the boys' doubles title there with countryman Jonas Forejtek in 2019.
“Wimbledon is a special place for me,” Lehecka said. “It was the first time I had success on grass. We won the junior doubles title there. There were so many firsts that year [2019]. I must say that I didn't know perfectly how to play on grass, I was just going with the flow.
“It was my first time being at a champions' dinner as a junior winner… I enjoyed my time so much back then and of course, two years ago I was playing pretty well on grass. It's always special to come back to Wimbledon to compete, and just to be there at the club.”

Despite being sidelined last year, Lehecka has returned to grass in 2025 with vengeance. He has already matched his win tally of five matches on the surface from his breakout 2023 campaign, establishing himself as a serious threat once more.
Prior to Wimbledon, Lehecka has unfinished business at Queen's Club, where he is into his third ATP Tour semi-final of the season. Across the net will be British No. 1 Jack Draper, who will aim to channel his home support to a memorable victory.
“It will be a big battle as always,” said Lehecka, who trails Draper 1-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “Jack is a great competitor, he's having the best season of his life so far. It will be a great challenge and I'm looking forward to it.
“He's the favourite and he's on home soil, but at the same time, I know I have the game to give him problems on the court.”

The two-time ATP Tour champion, Lehecka reached a career-high No. 22 in the PIF ATP Rankings in February after he reached the semi-finals at the ATP 500 in Doha. He stunned top seed Carlos Alcaraz that week before falling to Draper, but this week Lehecka is the only semi-finalist to have not dropped a set en route.
“There is no better place to play my first semi-final on grass than here at Queen's,” said Lehecka. “Over the years I have just felt that my game is stronger on grass and I can use my weapons more. It's great to be back here at Queen's, some of the best grass courts in the world.”

Jack Draper continues to impress at Queen's, booking his place in the semi-finals.

The British number one began the tournament knowing a run to the semi-finals could secure him a top-four seeding at Wimbledon later this month.

Draper eased past Jenson Brooksby in his opening match, but faced a far tougher test in round two against Australia's Alexei Popyrin.

Edging through in a third-set tiebreaker, Draper beat Popyrin 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 to advance to his third Queen's Club Championships quarterfinal.

Qualifying for the semi-finals for the first time and guaranteeing himself a top-four seeding at the All England Club, Draper took down Brandon Nakashima in three sets, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.

During his post-match interview Draper was asked whether he thinks the famous ‘Henman Hill' should be renamed in his honor.

The 23-year-old gave a typically modest answer when he was asked if Henman Hill should be renamed if he keeps up his current run of form.

“Draper's Dune, but that's sand,” joked Draper.

“No, let's keep it Henman Hill for now.

“We have not changed it for Andy [Murray], and Andy would be next in line for that, so maybe one day I will have something, but I don't think there's something that goes with Draper [for the hill].”

Draper doesn't think he quite warrants a renaming of Henman Hill just yet, but took the time to thank the crowd for their support on Andy Murray Arena.

“It means the world to me. The support I have received has been amazing. I am used to battling against the crowd, so this week is nice for that,” he said.

“To be in the semi-final here for the first time is honestly something I have wanted since I was a little kid, so it means everything to me.

“I think it definitely helps. It helps to have you guys behind me. Also, at times I have not played some great tennis, and in those moments I have just really tried to believe in myself, and I think that is where the confidence comes from, from the start of the year, and that has carried me through.

“I hope that carries on until the next round and carries me through.”

The Brit was then asked for his thoughts on the top-four seeding at Wimbledon, which will see him avoid the likes of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz until the semi-finals.

“I keep being asked by journalists about the top four seeding. It's like, well, I have got to get to the semis first,” said Draper.

“I mean, that's not guaranteed. To be in that position is an incredible feeling.

“I was at Wimbledon last year and ranked 40, so to go there ranked fourth, that's a testament to all the hard work me and my team have done, so very proud of that.”

Draper will now rest up ahead of his semi-final match with Jiri Lehecka on Saturday, June 21.

Aorangi Terrace, better known as Henman Hill, is a banked area where fans can watch matches on a big TV screen at the side of Court 1 at Wimbledon.

The nickname ‘Henman Hill' was born in the 1990s when fans of British star Tim Henman would gather on the hill to watch his matches.

Over the years, and particularly following Henman's retirement in 2007, the hill has been given several other nicknames, referencing British players.

Unsurprisingly, few stuck, although some began using Murray Mound when Andy Murray ended the 70+ year wait for a British winner at Wimbledon.

Despite all of Murray's success, the hill still belongs to Henman, as fans continue to use the name ‘Henman Hill'.

Appearing on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in 2009, Henman joked that he and Murray made an agreement over the name of the hill.

“[Murray] can have all those Grand Slams he's going to win, but I'm keeping my hill,” he said.

Only time will tell if Draper can carve out a legacy worthy of renaming the hill, but the likelihood is that Henman Hill is here to stay.

The 2025 Wimbledon tournament is scheduled to begin on Monday, June 30.

Jack Draper is into the semi-finals of Queen's for the first time after another gritty performance ousted the USA's Brandon Nakashima in three sets.

The win also means that he will return to No 4 in the world after this tournament, overtaking Novak Djokovic and Taylor Fritz. It is a useful step up, because a top-four seeding at Wimbledon means that he won't have to face either Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner until the semi-finals.

Draper had to scrap extremely hard for this 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 victory, which depended largely on his remarkable ability to repel break points. He faced 11 of them in the match, and was broken only once.

There were moments when the home fans began to show their perplexity at Draper's fondness for the drop shot, which never seemed to work against an extremely fleet-footed opponent.

But he brought his other virtues to the party, notably a first serve that grew in influence over the course of the match. By the time he reached the deciding set, he was landing it two-thirds of the time, and his eventual tally of 14 aces played a significant part in the match.

The victory earns him a meeting with Jiri Lehecka, after the Czech defeated the other surviving Briton – Draper's junior contemporary Jacob Fearnley – in straight sets.

More to follow.

Katie Boulter's hopes of defending her Nottingham title ended at the quarter-final stage, delivering a blow to her chances at Wimbledon.

In a tournament and on a court that she described as feeling like “home”, Boulter was unable to take control of the match and convert the points that mattered in a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 defeat by McCartney ­Kessler.

Boulter started the tournament, which she had won in successive years, ranked 39th in the world, with the top 32 given protected seedings at Wimbledon, thus avoiding coming up against a top-ranked player until the third round. But ­following this setback she will drop to 41.

“If I was chasing points and chasing rankings, then I'd be playing next week, but my plan is not to because I want to prioritise Wimbledon and that's something I've not done before, so I'd quite like to try something different,” a defiant Boulter said after the match.

Where Boulter was subdued in her match against Sonay Kartal on Thursday, she was much more vocal on court against American Kessler.

The pair were evenly matched in a contest stretching 2hr 7min on a hot day in Nottingham, but Boulter was left to rue what could have been after breaking twice in the decider. Both times she was unable to avoid being broken back herself.

At 4-3 ahead in the third, and needing only two more service games to go her way to win the match and reach the semi-finals for a third successive year, Boulter faltered. She lost her next two service games as Kessler carved out three match points on the Briton's serve, taking the second.

Despite the outcome in the Midlands, Boulter believes she is in a good place 10 days out from Wimbledon. “I played the way I wanted to play, I went after my shots and played the way I know I can, and I think that's some of the best tennis that I've played this year,” she said.

Draper is talking to the BBC.

On reaching the semis: “It means the world to me. The support I have received this week has been amazing. I've been getting used to having the crowd against me lately so this is really nice. To be in the semi-final for the first time is something I've wanted to do ever since I was a little kid, so it means everything to me.”

On tough three-set battles and winning due to having the confidence of recent victories: “It definitely helps to have you guys behind me, also at times I've not played great tennis and in those times I've just tried to believe in myself and I think that's where the confidence comes from, from the start of the year, and that's carried me through really, and hefully I can carry it on into th next round and keep playing a bit better

On returning to No 4 in the world rankings and therefore being among the top four seeds at Wimbledon. Does that give  added belief? “Not really, to be honest. I keep on getting asked by the journalists about top-four seedings, but I had to get to the semis first... but obviously to be in that position it's an incredible feeling. I was ranked 40 at Wimbledon last year and to go there ranked fourth is a testament to all the hard work me and my team have done – so very proud of that...

Should [Henman] Hill be renamed and if so what should we call it?

“Draper's Dune? But that's sand, isn't it? Nah, let's keep it Henman Hill for now. We didn't change it for Andy and he would have been next in line for that so maybe one day I'll have something but I don't think there's something that goes with Draper yet.

Draper wins the set.

A tight first set there, with the key statistic being Draper's 100 per cent record when facing break points. He saved all six that he faced, and also looked very secure when he came forward to the net. The only thing he might be disappointed with is a low tally of just two aces, as against six from his opponent.

Nakashima is reading the Draper serve remarkably well, and the backhand return winner he hit up the line in the last game was a collector's item: I can't remember the last time anyone did that to Draper's slider. Incidentally, did anyone else think that graphic of the ball at deuce in Nakashima's last service game showed it out, but called it in? Or was it my ageing eyes?

There is a secondary benefit to the tactic, though, as it prevents Nakashima from dropping deep in defence.

Draper is looking smooth and confident here in the early stages. I saw him on the balcony yesterday and he said he was feeling better, after dealing with a heavy cold early in the week.

Getting through the Popyrin second-round match on Wednesday was a decent effort in the circumstances.

Nakashima, on paper, is the sort of match you want, because he gives you rhythm and he doesn't have Popyrin's point-ending power. But he is a very crafty player nevertheless, and his serve is deceptively strong.

Draper came though a really tight match against Alexei Popyrin in the last round, coming from a set down to win 3-6, 6-2, 7-6, changing his racket in the middle of the final-set tie-break.

Today's opponent Brandon Nakashima is a big-serving American who looks at home on grass. The world No 32 already has one British scalp to his name, having beaten Dan Evans in two closely contested sets in the previous round.

Nakashima is the latest in a growing list of impressive American tennis players. coming in the wake of Tommy Paul, who won this event last year, and Taylor Fritz, the world No 4.

The 23-yeaar-old is not to be underestimated.

Welcome to our live coverage of the HSBC Championship from The Queen's Club, where Jack Draper is looking to reach the semi-final for the first time at the expense of Brandon Nakashima of the United States.

Draper is hoping to succeed where Jacob Fearnley failed in the match before his on the Andy Murray Arena, the Briton losing in straight sets to Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic 7-5, 6-2.

Victory is particularly important for the British No 1 as the defeat of Taylor Fritz yesterday means Draper could earn himself the world number four ranking and consequently a top-four seeding at Wimbledon, which would mean him avoiding the likes of Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Alexander Zverev in the early rounds at the All England Club later this month.

But don't let's get ahead of ourselves.

Jack Draper defeats Brandon Nakashima to reach the semi-finals of the HSBC Championship at Queen's Club; follow scores and reports from Queen's Club and you can watch all the action from the tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, stream through NOW and Sky Sports app

Friday 20 June 2025 18:39, UK

Jack Draper beat Brandon Nakashima to advance to the semi-finals of the Queen's Club championship and guarantee he will be fourth seed at Wimbledon.

It's a significant step for Draper, meaning he'd avoid potential matches with Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner until the semi-finals of his home major later this month.

He will overtake 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic and American Taylor Fritz in the world rankings, climbing from sixth to fourth.

At Queen's on Friday he defeated the Brandon Nakashima in three tight sets, 6-4 5-7 6-4.

"I've got to get to the semis first," he smiled, before adding: "I think it's a definite huge step for me.

"I remember last year going in ranked around 30 or 40. To be inside the top four one year around, that's massive progress, a testament to my team, the dedication I have had for tennis, the work I have put in on a daily basis.

"You know, I live and breathe the sport, and I'm obsessed with progressing and obsessed with becoming the player that I want to become all the time and achieve the things I want to.

"It's another step in the right direction. At Wimbledon, regardless of seeding, each match is very difficult, because obviously you've got loads of top players in the draw, a bit like this week.

"But it gives me confidence knowing I'm in that position and I'm going to be in the right place for that."

Nakashima opened the match with a strong service game but soon Draper had him under pressure. He took an early break in the first set and consolidated it with a hold in the next game.

That put him in a commanding position. Nakashima did get two break points in the sixth game but Draper eventually warded off the threat. He blasted down an ace to take the first set.

In the second set Nakashima began to serve better, tightening up the contest. He remained composed as he secured two set points against Draper's serve. The British No 1 defended the first but hit too long on the second as Nakashima took the match to a decider.

Tim Henman (1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006)
Andy Murray (2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016)
Greg Rusedski (1997)
James Ward (2011)
Cameron Norrie (2021)
Jack Draper (2025)

Draper seized a break in the seventh game and built on that to take a clear lead in the final set.

Serving for the set, Draper dropped 0-30 behind Nakashima before a hefty ace brought him into the game. The American still exerted pressure on Draper getting two break points to draw level in the deciding set. But pin-point forehand on to the line from Draper defended the first of them and he bellowed with satisfaction as Nakashima struck a return of serve too long to take them to deuce.

Draper got himself to match point and raced to the net to send Nakashima scrambling across the court before finishing the match off.

"It means the world to me, the support I've received this week has been amazing," added Draper after becoming Britain's first semi-finalist since Cameron Norrie in 2021.

"At times I've not played great tennis but I've tried to believe in myself."

Top seed Alcaraz eased through to the other semi-final after beating Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech 7-5 6-4.

Alcaraz, who spent almost three and a half hours on court on Thursday beating fellow Spaniard Jaume Munar, said: "I could feel better but honestly I thought I would be feeling worse than I am right now.

"But as tennis players we have to do what we have to do and that's to recover and play the next day. I am glad today was one hour and 20 minutes."

The 23-year-old will play Jiri Lehecka in the semi-finals after the Czech brought Jacob Fearnley's Queen's Club run to an end in their quarter-final.

The British No 2 looked heavy-legged in an error-strewn 7-5 6-2 defeat to the Czech world No 30.

Fearnley was scheduled to play the opening match on the Andy Murray Arena despite a gruelling three-setter against Corentin Moutet the day before, followed by a win in the doubles - alongside Cameron Norrie - against Lehecka and Taylor Fritz.

Lehecka got revenge for that defeat by preventing Fearnley from becoming the first British man to reach the semi-finals on his Queen's Club debut in 48 years.

Fearnley coughed up eight double faults in the first set, including three in both the games in which Lehecka broke his serve.

Lehecka struck again for 3-2 in the second after a Fearnley forehand landed a millimetre out and then ran away with the match, wrapping up victory in an hour and 17 minutes.

"Obviously if I'd known I was going to be put on first the day after playing a long match in 32 degrees and playing another doubles match late at night, then I probably wouldn't have played doubles," he said.

"It's just difficult to predict those things sometimes. It's just about being smart about it, really."

Daniil Medvedev overcame a nosebleed to reach the semi-finals of the Terra Wortmann Open in Germany.

Medvedev took a medical timeout to deal with the unwanted second-set interruption against Alex Michelsen, but the world No 11 ploughed on to beat his American opponent 6-4 6-3.

"The shadows on the court made the conditions quite difficult," former world No 3 Medvedev said after an 85-minute match in which Michelsen fended off four match points.

"It took some time to get used to it. It was then better in the second set."

Medvedev has not dropped a set in the Halle tournament and will meet Alexander Zverev for a place in the final.

The German favourite booked his last-four spot with a hard-fought 6-4 7-6 (8-6) victory over Italy's Flavio Cobolli.

 Under the weather early, but into the Terra Wortmann Open semi-finals on time nonetheless. 

 Alexander Zverev endured a rough start to his quarter-final clash with Flavio Cobolli on Friday at the grass ATP 500 in Halle, before the home favourite returned to seal a 6-4, 7-6(6) victory. Zverev had to rush from the court for an impromptu toilet break due to illness at 1-0, 40/40 in the first set, but later completed a one-hour, 41-minute triumph at OWL Arena. 

 “I felt fine before the match, and then out of nowhere I felt really, really bad and felt ill,” explained Zverev. “I went to throw up, and then 15 minutes later I felt okay again. So I don't know what it was. I've never experienced that before, to be honest. Hopefully I will be fine the next couple of hours, when the adrenalin settles. After that, I think it was a pretty good match.”

 Zverev let out a burst of emotion after firing a big first serve, which Cobolli was unable to return, to clinch his win in the second-set tie-break. The second seed is now 21-8 in Halle, where he reached the championship match in 2016 and 2017, while has now become just the fifth player to reach five or more semi-finals at the event after former champions Roger Federer, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Philipp Kohlschreiber and Tommy Haas. 

 In a rematch of their Roland Garros third-round meeting just less than three weeks ago, Zverev earned another straight-sets victory against Cobolli with an impressive serving performance in Halle. The second seed won 81 per cent (46/57) of points behind his first serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats, while he also crucially saved all six break points he faced by rallying from 0/40 in both the second and fourth games of the match. 

 A finalist in Stuttgart last week, Zverev will now aim to earn back-to-back championship-match appearances on grass when he faces one of his oldest rivals in the semi-finals: Daniil Medvedev. 



 Medvedev earlier overcame Alex Michelsen 6-4, 6-3 to reach his third tour-level semi-final of the season. The 29-year-old, who is guaranteed to return to the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday after spending six weeks as No. 11, leads Zverev 12-7 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. 

 “I think it's the guy I played the most in my career, so I'm looking forward to it,” said Zverev ahead of his first tour-level meeting with Medvedev since the 2024 Australian Open semi-finals. “A lot of things happened in the past 18 months. Definitely he's one of the toughest opponents in my career. It's going to be a great match and I'm really looking forward to facing him.” 

 Alexander Bublik and Karen Khachanov will contest the second semi-final on Saturday in Halle. Bublik, who stunned World No. 1 and 2024 champion Jannik Sinner in the second round, eased past seventh seed Tomas Machac 7-6(2), 6-3. The Kazakhstani later revealed his delight at the way he backed up the biggest win of his career. 

 “I didn't have a really good night of sleep [after the Sinner win],” admitted 2023 Halle titlist Bublik. “I tried to keep focused, but there are thoughts and everything on social media, receiving a lot of messages. But I'm really happy I was in control of the match [against Machac]. I lost it a bit at the end of the first set… He broke my serve, but I was solid enough to take the tie-break.” 

 Bublik will aim to sink a seeded opponent for the third consecutive day when he takes on eighth seed Khachanov, who downed Tomas Martin Etcheverry 6-3, 6-2, at OWL Arena. Khachanov enters the semi-final clash having won the pair's only previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, in 2020 in Cincinnati.

Aryna Sabalenka has joked that ATP Tour star Grigor Dimitrov was “begging” her to play in the US Open mixed doubles event before ultimately agreeing to partner with the Bulgarian.

WTA world No 1 Sabalenka will pair up with ATP world No 19 Dimitrov at the revamped mixed doubles competition at Flushing Meadows this August.

The new format will see the mixed event held before the start of the singles main draw, and features some of the biggest names in the sport.

Among the marquee pairings are Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud, and Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe.

Nine of the current WTA top-10 are set to be in action, with world No 2 Coco Gauff currently the only player not entered.

However, it took some persuading for three-time Grand Slam singles champion Sabalenka to sign up.

Speaking at the Berlin Open, the Belarusian admitted she was unaware of the change to the format before ultimately agreeing to play with Dimitrov.

“He was just like texting me non-stop,” joked Sabalenka.

“He was begging me to play, and I was like, ‘Man, I don't want to play.' But he was begging and I was like: ‘Ok, you got it,'

“He messaged me, and I didn't really know about the mixed doubles situation at the US Open.

“I was like: ‘What are you talking about? Why would we play mixed doubles?' And he was explaining to me how it was before the US Open.

Emma Raducanu's comments on prize money debate attract attention: ‘Never really going to take a stand'

Lois Boisson & Petra Kvitova Wimbledon wildcard decisions backed by Grand Slam winner: ‘Whoever they want'

“So I was like, ‘But nobody approached me, so I don't know if I am invited.' So we figured, and yeah, we decided probably straight after the Australian Open.”

The revamped mixed doubles event in New York hands Sabalenka the chance to complete a sweep of titles at the US Open.

Sabalenka memorably triumphed in the women's singles event at the tournament in 2024, beating Jessica Pegula in the final after tasting defeat in the 2023 final to Gauff.

However, the Belarusian also lifted the women's doubles title at the tournament in 2019, partnering with Elise Mertens to beat Ashleigh Barty and Victoria Azarenka in the final.

Sabalenka was a world No 1 in doubles and also lifted the 2021 Australian Open title alongside Mertens, though she has not played a doubles major since then.

Two Blue Devil standouts will compete together on American tennis' biggest stage. 

Rising junior Cooper Williams and graduate Theo Winegar — Duke's top doubles pairing for the latter part of the season — emerged victorious in the 2025 American Collegiate Wild Card Playoff. The tournament is a novel opportunity for collegiate tennis players to qualify for the U.S. Open, one of four professional tennis Grand Slams, or major tournaments.

“I'm extremely proud of Cooper and Theo," said Duke men's tennis head coach Ramsey Smith. "They had a tremendous spring season, finishing No. 3 in the country, and they earned the opportunity to compete in this inaugural wild card event. For them to win both matches in straight-sets and earn a berth into the U.S. Open is such an incredible opportunity for them. It's amazing for the program and I couldn't be happier for the two of them.”

This inaugural year for the wild card playoff doubled the amount of guaranteed spots for college tennis players at the U.S. Open. Four top men's and women's singles players and four men's and women's doubles teams competed in the wild card playoffs. 

Williams and Winegar won their semifinal match against SMU's Trevor Svajda and Louis Cloud 7-6, 7-5. The Blue Devil tandem grabbed the first set with a 7-5 tiebreaker score, and despite being down 4-1 in the second, roared back to knock off the Mustangs. 

In the final match Thursday afternoon against more conference opponents, Nicholas Godsick and Hudson Rivera of Stanford, Williams and Winegar took both sets 6-4, 6-4. Duke's team had also defeated Godsick and Rivera in April's ACC Championship semifinals. 

The pair played together for much of the fall and rejoined forces late in dual-match play. In total, they only lost two of 15 matches together, finishing undefeated in the spring with five straight wins. They earned ITA All-America honors as the third-ranked team in the nation. 

Winegar, a doubles specialist, transferred from Columbia for his graduate season and played at the No. 1 and No. 2 doubles courts throughout the season. Williams was the former ITA National Rookie of the Year at Harvard and demonstrated his elite talent as the year went on, holding his own on the top two singles courts and winning seven consecutive matches in March and April. 

The U.S. Open will begin Aug. 24 in its annual location of Queens, New York.

It is the partnership attracting attention from across the tennis and wider sporting world.

The revamped mixed doubles event at this summer's US Open has attracted many of the biggest names in tennis, though no pairing has generated as much hype as Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu.

Two of the biggest stars of their generation, the two Grand Slam champions will team up in New York this summer as they look to add another US Open title to their cabinets.

“She's gonna be the boss,” joked Alcaraz when asked about the partnership at Queen's.

“I'm super excited about it. I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament.

“I've known Emma for a really long time ago, so we know each other. I have a really good relationship with her. We are going to enjoy it, for sure.

“I will try to bring my doubles skill. We will try to win, but obviously it's going to be really, really fun.

“I was thinking that I couldn't play better if unless it was with Emma. I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. Yeah, I made that special request.”

Now, the US Open has revealed a special video in which Alcaraz and Raducanu are seen joking about their blockbuster partnership.

Asked to answer if they call ‘heads' or ‘tails' at a coin toss before a match, the two burst out laughing after providing different answers: Raducanu calling tails, while Alcaraz calls heads.

Alcaraz also jokingly asked Raducanu a question about whether she would chose to serve or return to start a match: “What would you pick if we win the coin toss?”

“I'd let you pick,” responded Raducanu. “That's what I would do – and then you can choose. I'm just going to take his lead.”

Alcaraz and Raducanu are one of several big-name pairings confirmed for the all-star event, which is replacing a traditional mixed doubles event in 2025.

Several all-American pairings will be competing at their home Slam, including Ben Shelton and Taylor Townsend, Jessica Pegula and Tommy Paul, and Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe.

Novak Djokovic is set to compete alongside compatriot Olga Danilovic and Jannik Sinner partners Emma Navarro, while Iga Swiatek teams up with Casper Ruud.

Italian Tennis Prodigy Jannik Sinner Faces Crushing Defeat Breaking Streaks and Records in Halle

In a shocking turn of events, Jannik Sinner, the Italian tennis sensation, suffered a defeat at the hands of Alexander Bublik in the round of 16 at the ATP 500 event in Halle. This loss marked the end of several incredible streaks and records that Sinner had managed to uphold for years.

Sinner had an impressive record of 48-0 against players other than Carlos Alcaraz, and he had not lost to a player outside the top 20 for 673 days. The 23-year-old's remarkable 66-match winning streak came to a halt in Halle, with his last loss against Dusan Lajovic at Cincinnati in 2023. Only Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have achieved longer winning streaks against players outside the top 20 in the past.

Furthermore, Sinner, who was ranked number one in the world, had reached eight consecutive finals in major tournaments since Cincinnati 2024. His defeat in Halle was the first time he had not advanced to a final since the Canada Open in the previous year. Notably, Sinner's exit from the round of 16 came after 19 consecutive tournaments where he had reached at least the quarterfinals, showcasing his consistency and dominance in the tennis world.

The loss at Halle signifies a new chapter for Jannik Sinner as he looks to bounce back and rebuild his impressive statistics and records on the international tennis circuit.

Former world No. 2 and two-time Wimbledon champion, Petra Kvitová, announced that she will retire from professional tennis after the upcoming US Open in August. In the course of her 19-year career, the 35-year-old Czech star won 31 singles titles.

Kvitová's decision to hang up the racket comes little over 5 months after her return to the courts, following a year-long hiatus and birth of her first child – son Petr.

At the end of June, Kvitová is set to compete at Wimbledon, where she first burst onto the tennis scene, becoming the first player born in the 1990s to win a major title in 2011. She went on to win the WTA Tour Finals - the most significant tennis event in the women's annual calendar - that same year.

“I am excited and very much looking forward to soak in the beauty of playing The Championships, Wimbledon one more time, a place that holds the most cherished memories in my career for me,” she writes on Instagram.

In her message Kvitová also thanks for the “unwavering support” she received throughout her decorated professional journey, starting in 2006, and says she is prepared for the next step:

“As with all phases in life, there comes a day that it is time for a new chapter, and that time for me has come now. While no such decision is ever easy to make, for me this is a happy moment! I will leave the sport with the biggest smile on my face – the same smile you've seen from me on and off court throughout my whole career.”

Adding to her WTA accolades, Kvitová took bronze at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. As part of the Czech team at the Billie Jean King Cup (formerly known as Fed Cup), she collected 6 titles between 2011 and 2018 – most of any player since the 1980s.

Aryna Sabalenka recently revealed that Grigor Dimitrov was the one who approached her to partner up for the mixed doubles event at the 2025 US Open. This year, the Belarusian will be defending her singles title at the New York Major after winning it in 2024 by defeating Jessica Pegula in the final.

The newly revamped mixed doubles competition is scheduled on Aug. 19 and Aug. 20, 2025, during US Open Fan Week at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. This year, the event will feature a fresh format, and the United States Tennis Association (USTA) already announced several pairings, including the duo of Sabalenka and Dimitrov.

Sabalenka is currently competing at the 2025 Berlin Tennis Open, where she is the top seed. After receiving a first-round bye, she began her campaign in the second round, defeating qualifier Rebeka Masarova 6-2, 7-6(6). She advanced to the quarterfinals, where she is set to face Elena Rybakina.

During the post-match press conference following her victory over Masarova, Sabalenka revealed that it was Dimitrov who initially reached out to her, asking her to partner with him for the mixed doubles at the upcoming US Open. Although at first she dismissed the idea, she ultimately agreed after Dimitrov “begged” her to join him.

“He was just like texting me non-stop. He was begging me to play, and I was like, ‘Man, I don't want to play.' But he was begging and I was like, ‘Ok, you got it,'” Sabalenka said.



Sabalenka admitted that she was unaware of the new mixed doubles format, as no one had previously approached her about it. However, she and Dimitrov discussed the opportunity and decided to team up for the tournament earlier this year, shortly after the Australian Open.

“He messaged me, and I didn't really know about the mixed doubles situation at the US Open. I was like, ‘What are you talking about? Why would we play mixed doubles?' And he was like explaining to me how it was before the US Open.”

“So I was like, ‘But nobody approached me, so I don't know if I am invited.' So we figured, and yeah, we decided probably straight after the Australian Open,” she added.

Dimitrov's best performance at the US Open came in 2019 when he reached the semifinals in singles. During that run, he triumphed over Andreas Seppi, Borna Ćorić, Kamil Majchrzak, Alex de Minaur, and Roger Federer to reach the semifinals. There, he lost to eventual runner-up Daniil Medvedev.

Sabalenka's best result in the US Open doubles came in 2019 when she clinched the title alongside her partner, Elise Mertens. The duo entered the tournament as the fourth seed and began their campaign with a straight sets victory over Anna Blinkova and Wang Yafan, winning the match 6-3, 6-4.
Sabalenka and Mertens overcame Karolína Muchová and Jil Teichmann 7-6(1), 6-3, and the pair of Viktorija Golubic and Sara Sorribes Tormo 6-4, 7-5 to advance to the quarterfinals.

In the quarterfinals, the pair triumphed over the 12th-seeded Chinese team of Duan Yingying and Zheng Saisai with a scoreline of 6-4, 6-3. In their semifinal match, they registered a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over American duo Caroline Dolehide and Vania King, securing their place in the final.

In the championship match, Sabalenka and Mertens faced off against the eighth-seeded pair of Ashleigh Barty and Victoria Azarenka and defeated them 7-5, 7-5 to win the 2019 US Open women's doubles title, both earning their first Grand Slam doubles title.

Jannik Sinner revealed it “wasn't easy” to return to court so quickly after his French Open final defeat after losing in the second round of his Halle Open title defence.

World No 1 Sinner was looking to become just the fourth man to win multiple Halle titles but was stunned 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 by 2023 champion Alexander Bublik on Friday.

The Italian had dispatched Bublik convincingly when they met in the last eight of the French Open two weeks ago, and had won his previous 66 matches against players outside the top 20, dating back to August 2023.

Sinner had also won his last 49 matches against players not named Carlos Alcaraz, with Bublik the first person other than Alcaraz to beat the Italian since Andrey Rublev in August 2024.

“We are tennis players and we try to win every match we play, but it is a special one,” said Bublik. “I had never beaten a No 1 in the world. It is an accomplishment.

“On grass, if you lose your serve, it is maybe tough and I am a guy who doesn't lose a lot of serves. I just kept serving and putting him in uncomfortable positions and it worked well.”

Sinner's loss came just 10 days after his heartbreaking final defeat at Roland Garros, holding a two-set lead and three championship points before losing to Alcaraz in a final-set tiebreak.

Speaking after his loss in Halle, the 23-year-old admitted he was pleased to get some matches under his belt on grass after his painful clay-court loss less than two weeks ago.

“I had my chances to win,” admitted Sinner.

“In the second set, he gave me little room to manoeuvre on his serve, but in the third, I had opportunities that could have tipped the match in my favour.

“I felt it was going to come down to two or three points. I tried everything, but it didn't work. He was better in key situations, and the truth is that after the defeat in Paris, it wasn't easy to be competitive here.

“I'm relatively satisfied to have been able to play two matches on grass before Wimbledon.”

Sinner's defeat to Bublik means he will not be in action again until the third Grand Slam tournament of the year at the All England Club, where the world No 1 will be the top seed.

After Roland Garros two weeks ago, Wimbledon is now the only Slam at which the three-time Grand Slam winner is yet to reach the final.

Sinner reached his first Grand Slam semi-final at the tournament back in 2o23, losing to Novak Djokovic, while he was beaten in the quarter-final by Daniil Medvedev in 2024.

The world No 1 will look to become the first Italian ever to lift the Wimbledon title, and just the second to reach the final following Matteo Berrettini in 2021.

ATP World No. 1 Jannik Sinner lost to Alexander Bublik in the second round of the Halle Open last Thursday, June 19. Sinner, who had won the tournament in 2024, thus failed to defend his title and will lose 500 ranking points as a result. Hence, his total points will be (10880-500) 10380.

Carlos Alcaraz, Sinner's rival and the current world No. 2, has 8850 ranking points at the moment. Thus, there is a gap of almost 1500 points between the two.

Alcaraz is currently playing at the HSBC Championship at Queen's Club in London. He beat Jaume Munar in the round of 16 in a gripping three-setter to book a place in the quarterfinals, where he will face Arthur Rinderknech of France. Alcaraz had lost in the round of 16 at Queen's Club last year, which means that he had 50 ranking points to defend in the tournament this year.

The 22-year-old Spaniard has already reached the quarterfinals this time, which means that he is assured of gaining 50 (100-50) ranking points even if he loses in his quarterfinal match. It will take his tally to 8900 ranking points.

Should he win his next match and reach the semifinals, and then lose, he will stand to gain 150 (200-50) ranking points. It will take him to 9000, still almost 1300 points short of Sinner.

Reaching the final and losing in it will earn the Spaniard 330 points, and he will thereby gain 280 (330-50) ranking points. It will take his tally to 9130 (8850 +280) points. That means that Jannik Sinner will still be ahead of him by almost 1200 points.

Lastly, if Alcaraz goes on to win the tournament and earn all 500 points, his tally will be (8850+500-50) 9300 points, which will be around 1000 short of Sinner's tally.

Carlos Alcaraz has won Wimbledon in each of the last two years and hence, will have 2000 points to defend this year. Jannik Sinner lost in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon last year, which means that he will have 400 ranking points to defend.

That is a significant difference, and hence, Sinner will have very little to lose. Alcaraz, meanwhile, will have everything to play for, and his inability to win the tournament will take him back in the race for the ATP No. 1 spot.

Ben Shelton is enjoying a strong year on the ATP Tour as he continues to impress.

The young American qualified for his second Grand Slam semi-final in January, when Shelton beat Lorenzo Sonego in the Australian Open quarterfinals.

Failing in his bid to reach the final, Shelton came up short against Jannik Sinner in straight sets, 6-7, 2-6, 2-6.

He's had several good performances since, reaching the quarterfinals in Miami, the final in Munich on clay, and the semi-finals of the Stuttgart Open on grass.

Following his run to the last four in Stuttgart, Shelton broke into the ATP top ten for the first time in his career.

Reacting to the news, a former doubles world number one explained why nobody wants to play Shelton right now.

Appearing on the Australian Open TV podcast, seven-time Grand Slam doubles champion John Fitzgerald pinpointed the reason why Shelton is a nightmare to play against.

“I think when you serve that well, no one wants to play you,” he said.

“Those left-handers, that's an unfair advantage. When you're a lefty and you serve that well, it's a difficult thing to combat if you're just a non-talented right-hander.

“I wouldn't have liked to play Ben Shelton, with that serve, you're battling away to hold your own serve, and he can just blow it past you quickly, game after game.”

The Australian suggested Shelton is a ‘throwback' player, who competes differently from other players on tour.

“He's a bit of a throwback for me. He's got a game that looks like it was played ten years ago or 15 years ago, but that can be a good thing,” said Fitzgerald.

“There were more players like him that had that style back then, there are more players these days that are so tight with their mistakes, they don't give away balls as much as they should.

“Ben still does, but he's got flair on the other side of that.”

Fitzgerald went on to predict what Shelton's ‘ceiling' is, and named his best surface.

“I don't think there is a ceiling on this lad. I don't think anyone knows,” he said.

“He's got some talent, some strengths, and weaknesses that make him look like a more mature player. I think on the clay, you would imagine he would struggle a bit more, but on the hard court, it's obviously where he grew up, and on the grass he can do serious damage.”

The 64-year-old highlighted the areas of Shelton's game that can still be improved and commented on the current state of American tennis.

“I think he's probably going to have to keep his unforced errors down, maybe his shot selection needs to be improved. He gives away some points at the wrong time, and plays some low-percentage stuff when he should think about high-percentage, but he's good,” said Fitzgerald.

“He's in the top ten, Taylor Fritz, Tommy Paul are already there. The Americans are looking pretty strong.”

When Shelton made his top ten debut on Monday, he joined Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul among the world's elite.

The United States of America last had three players ranked inside the world's top ten in 2006 with Andy Roddick (4), James Blake (6), and Andre Agassi (10).

Full of confidence heading into the Queen's Club Championships having reached the semi-finals of the Stuttgart Open, Shelton suffered a shock defeat.

Taking on French lucky loser Arthur Rinderknech in round one, Shelton lost in straight sets 6-7, 6-7.

Despite the loss, Shelton is likely to hold on to his place in the top ten, provided Andrey Rublev doesn't reach the final of this week's Halle Open in Germany.

He'll want to push his latest defeat to the back of his mind as he looks ahead to Wimbledon later this month.

On Shelton's two previous visits to the All England Club, he failed to reach the quarterfinals as he holds a 4-2 record at the event.

Only time will tell if Shelton can break through and reach the last eight of Wimbledon for the first time in 2025.

The 2025 Wimbledon tournament is scheduled to begin on Monday, June 30.

The world No. 1 routed Bublik in the quarterfinals in Paris, but it was a different story on German grass.ByTENNIS.comPublished Jun 19, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 19, 2025

Is Jannik Sinner still suffering from a Roland Garros hangover? The world No. 1's title defense at the Terra Wortman Open came to a screeching halt in Round of 16 on Thursday in a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 defeat to Alexander Bublik.The world No. 1 came to Halle admitting to "sleepless nights" in the days following his agonizing five-set loss to Carlos Alcaraz in the championship match in Paris, in which he failed to convert three match points in what was the longest Roland Garros final in history. But after relaxing with family and friends in his hometown of Sexten, Sinner proclaimed ahead of the tournament that he was ready to "forget the negative" and attack his first grass-court tournament of the season with a clear head."I think playing in a tournament again is positive for me because every game starts at 0-0 and you always have to be mentally prepared to fight for every point on the court," he said, and went on to defeat German Yannick Hanfmann 7-5, 6-3 in his first match.Although Sinner routed Bublik in the quarterfinals in Paris, but it was a different story on German grass, a fact Bublik himself acknowledged afterwards speaking to Tennis Channel DE. Fifteen days ago, Sinner was a 6-1, 7-5, 6-0 winner over Bublik, his fourth win in four completed matches against the Kazakh. (Sinner lost a 2023 meeting by retirement.) But from a set ahead in Halle, Sinner was confounded by the mercurial 28-year-old—who also has a track record of success at the German grass-court stop.

This backhand return from Bublik is BANANAS 😱#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/SloqZG0VHU

Bublik, the 2023 Halle champion, hit 36 winners and 15 aces in the two-hour and two-minute victory, and saved all six break points he faced in the second and third sets combined. He came into the match with 12 career Top 10 wins, but was 0-3 against world No. 1s.But that wasn't the most impressive streak snapped by Bublik's victory. In addition to having won six straight matches in Halle, Sinner had also won 66 consecutive matches against players ranked outside the Top 20 dating back nearly two full years. His last such loss was to Serbian Dusan Lajovic in Cincinnati in 2023, when he was ranked No. 6 in the world and had yet to reach a Grand Slam final.Bublik, a former world No. 17, is currently ranked No. 45, and is the first man of any ranking not named Carlos Alcaraz to beat Sinner since last August."I think I had my chances," Sinner said afterwards, speaking to Tennis Channel DE. "I felt that only two or three points went Sascha's way today, and that was what made the difference in the end. But I came here, I tried everything, and after the defeat at Roland Garros, I knew right away."I'm relatively satisfied despite everything, two matches before Wimbledon. Of course, if there were more matches, it would certainly be better, but it's fine. I need to regenerate mentally and physically now, it takes a little time, and then, logically, I'll analyze it. I think everything will be fine at Wimbledon. To be honest, it was more physical here. Mentally, I was relatively good in the first round, but you can't expect every day to be the same, so you have to accept that and yes, it's fine."

Bublik will face No. 7 seed Tomas Machac of Czechia in the quarterfinals."The tournament continues, to be honest," Bublik said. "I knew that the chance really to beat those guys is only in between the Slams. I played Jannik less than two weeks ago and it was a different Jannik, I will tell you. But, nevertheless, it's number one. It's good for history, good for my achievements. I had the chance. It only was today and I used it, so I'm really happy."Sinner wasn't the only big name to lose in Halle on Thursday. No. 4 seed Andrey Rublev was a 6-3, 6-7(4), 7-6(6) loser to Tomas Martin Etcheverry of Argentina, failing to convert two match points. No. 2 seed Alexander Zverev, though, escaped defeat by rallying from a set behind to beat Italian Lorenzo Sonego, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(2).

It was a tough day for Alpine at the Canadian Grand Prix, with Franco Colapinto slipping backwards from P10 while Pierre Gasly remained out of contention for points.

Franco Colapinto was left to rue a “wrong” strategy after slipping backwards and out of the points at the Canadian Grand Prix, while Alpine team mate Pierre Gasly also conceded that the team “need to review” following a tough afternoon in Montreal.

Things had initially looked promising for Colapinto, who lined up in P10 on the grid after outqualifying Gasly for the first time since making his F1 comeback. However, after losing a position early on to Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, the Argentine later lost out further when he found himself in traffic following his first pit stop.

It proved to be a difficult race from then onwards for Colapinto and he ultimately crossed the line in 13th, having been unable to work his way back up into the top 10.

“I think we maximised what we've done today. It just didn't go our way, I think, strategy-wise,” the 22-year-old reflected after the race. “It was tricky to know [if] we were doing the wrong thing, but I think we definitely were doing the wrong stuff.

“At the beginning of the race, stopping early with so many cars starting on [the] hard [tyre], and the team mates of the guys in front making the race slow for them – it just put us in a really bad position, killing the tyres.

“I had really slow pace after that pit stop with the dirty air and [it was] very tricky to overtake, just power [limited] on the straights and it just made our race very tricky. We went a bit backwards.

“It was tough out there today, I think still [there were] some things learned and some things to take, but we need to focus on the next one.”

Despite the disappointing outcome, Colapinto acknowledged that the weekend as a whole had felt like his strongest since making his return to the grid with Alpine in Imola.

“Yeah, it feels like that,” he explained. “It's just that when you start in the points you want to stay there, and it feels like we didn't do the right things today to try and stay [there], and that's the only thing.”

It was also a challenging day at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve for Gasly. The Frenchman had it all to do after starting from the pit lane – due to changes being made to his car under parc ferme conditions – and a one-stop strategy failed to move him closer towards the points, meaning that he ended the race in P15.

“We tried with the strategy – to be fair, we tried everything we could,” Gasly admitted. “[We were] just very slow in the straights, so we need to review exactly what we could have done better.

“I think we had some pace, it's just been a very frustrating afternoon, being stuck behind cars, and unfortunately we're just slower than them in the straights and it made it very, very tricky to pass, so we'll review it.”

Gasly's tricky afternoon also saw him forced wide onto the grass by Lance Stroll during a battle for P17, an incident that resulted in the Aston Martin driver receiving a 10-second time penalty.

Reflecting on the clash, the 29-year-old said: “We kind of got side-by-side into the last corner. I feel like he could have done a slightly better job to give me a bit more room – not talking about much, I know we're both at the limit and we're talking a few centimetres.

“But unfortunately it put me in the grass – I had to try to cut the chicane and get back on track. I think bigger picture is just [that it was] a bit of a frustrating afternoon, not being able to race.”

	There's no question that Broadway‘s Hamilton was (and still is) one of the most engrossing musicals on the Great White Way, but according to an original cast member, Madonna herself had other things to focus on.

	During his Thursday (June 19) appearance on Watch What Happens Live alonside singer Ciara, Anthony Ramos — who originated the roles of John Laurens and Philip Hamilton in the original Broadway run of the show — was asked about the “most terrifying celebrity to spot in the audience during your Hamilton days” during a game of Clubhouse of Horrors, and the actor immediately had an answer.

	“Oh, the most terrifying was Madonna with her iPad in her face. She was like this the whole time,” Ramos said, while pretending to look at a screen in his lap. “I was like, ‘Damn, shorty! If you not enjoying it that much, you know the door's right there. You ain't gotta stay here!'”

Billboard has reached out to Madonna's representatives for comment. 


	This isn't the first time the Queen of Pop has been called out for using her devices during the acclaimed Broadway show. After rumors circulated in 2015 of Madonna's behavior after star and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda tweeted about not allowing a celebrity backstage after they used their phone during the performance, actor Jonathan Groff confirmed in an interview it was Madge. “That b—h was on her phone. You couldn't miss it from the stage,” he said at the time. “It was a black void of the audience in front of us and her face there perfectly lit by the light of her iPhone through three-quarters of the show.”

	











	The news comes as Madonna prepares to release her long-rumored EDM remix album Veronica Electronica, set to feature exclusive reimaginings of tracks off her acclaimed 1988 album Ray of Light. Due out July 25, the album will feature remixes of eight songs off Ray of Light, including “Nothing Really Matters,” “Frozen” and “The Power of Goodbye.”

	We've confirmed that Owen Wilson is returning for Meet the Parents 4 opposite Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Teri Polo and new castmember Ariana Grande. 


	Wilson played Kevin Rawley in the series, the ex-fiancé of Polo's Pam. Fair to say that Stiller's Greg, who is looking to get the approval of Pam's rigid father, Jack Byrnes, (De Niro), is a bit jealous of Kevin. Kevin becomes a nuisance and Jack loves to throw Kevin up into Greg's face. Wilson's Kevin is wealthy, and a guy of all trades, including being a carpenter.


	While the plot is underwraps, THR says that one plot point centers around the song of Greg and Pam, “who gets engaged to a ball-busting woman who seems all wrong for him.” Grande is the fiancée.

[The following interview contains some spoilers for “The Waterfront.”]

Kevin Williamson was ready to put down his pen. In late 2019, following the cancellation of his CBS crime thriller “The Following,” the creator behind genre- and culturally-defining hits such as “The Vampire Diaries,” “Dawson's Creek” and the “Scream” film franchise was feeling burnt out.

“I was in a deal at Warner Bros. where you have to sing for your supper a little bit, in terms of making a pilot every season. And if you don't have a pilot, then, what good are you? So I realized I didn't have a pilot to show,” Williamson told IndieWire during a recent interview. “I was doing TV shows I didn't want to do. I was making shows I wouldn't watch. And as soon as you start doing that, you're in trouble. So I stopped and I quit, and I said, ‘No more TV.'”

But at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with most productions left at a standstill across the industry, Williamson began feeling increasingly restless. The copious amounts of alone time had forced Williamson to start contemplating how he would finally tell his most personal story to date: a drama series, set in his native North Carolina, loosely inspired by his commercial fisherman father's issues with the law.

 










In 1983, during Williamson's transition from high school to college, his father, Wade, was arrested for using his own boat to participate in an elaborate drug smuggling operation, and he was later convicted of conspiracy to traffic marijuana in excess of 20,000 pounds — the same crime that Joey Potter's dad was arrested for in “Dawson's Creek.” In retrospect, Williamson insists that his father did what he felt he needed to support his family, because the fishing business in North Carolina at that time was about to go “belly up.”

“I always teased my dad that I was going to do a show about him, and at first he would joke and say, ‘Well, just wait until I'm dead.' And then I finally said, ‘No, really, Dad.' He goes, ‘Well, I don't want to be dead and not see it,'” Williamson said, adding that Wade, a “Yellowstone” superfan, always wanted Kevin Costner to play him. “I started writing it, and then sadly, he passed [in 2020], but he was super proud. He was super excited for me. He was a very funny man, and I think he would've had a big smile on his face because he would've loved all the things we did.”

The final result is “The Waterfront,” which premiered this week on Netflix. Set in the fictional town of Havenport, North Carolina, the series stars “Mindhunter” star Holt McCallany as patriarch Harlan Buckley who, while recovering from two heart attacks, decides to retake control of his family's crumbling fishing empire after his wife Belle (Maria Bello) and son Cane (Jake Weary) resort to increasingly dangerous means to keep themselves afloat. One of those means? Smuggling opium at the whim of a mercurial drug kingpin (Topher Grace).

 










Given that he had just been contemplating retirement a few years ago, Williamson, who just turned 60 last year, admits that telling such a personal story has given him a second wind. “I'm not going to sit down yet — one day soon, but not today,” he said with a playful smile. “Look, I'm not writing teenagers anymore. I can't keep writing teenagers my whole career, so it was nice to sit down and write some adults.”

Speaking at the end of another long day of editing the next “Scream” sequel, Williamson opens up about the real-life elements which informed his long-awaited return to TV, how that explosive finale sets up a potential sophomore outing, the keys to building an epic love triangle — and why he thinks there will always be room for a good vampire story.

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

IndieWire: “The Waterfront” is not entirely about Harlan, but he is certainly the centrifugal force of this series. What parts of your own late father did you try to incorporate into the character that we see in this show?

Kevin Williamson: I really wanted to incorporate his sense of humor. My dad had a big sense of humor, and he had that sort of self-awareness where he could comment on any given situation that he was actually standing in. He had that ability, and I think he passed it to me. I found that to be part of something that Holt does as Harlan — he does a running commentary on what's happening. That inside voice becomes the outside voice. With Harlan, Holt really captures the spirit of my dad, but I think Holt drew on his own father and his own background to figure out who Harlan was. I think he did a beautiful job because he's just very honest.

 










You have always been known to create characters who are really an extension of how you see yourself. How did that manifest this time around? Are there any elements of yourself that you can recognize in the Buckley clan?

Cane is that lost individual who feels like he's second-guessing every choice he's ever made in his life, and I can spiral that way for sure, and I'm sure a lot of people can. I think [Melissa Benoist's] Bree speaks to the outsider. She's never felt like she belonged, and she also suffers from addiction issues, and I relate to her a lot. Belle was a lot of my mom. She was hard and cold when she needed to be; gentle, warm and nurturing when she needed to be. She was super in charge. My dad was a very simple but very complicated man, and he didn't show his feelings. But when he did, he felt them.

You have described “The Waterfront” as good people who are forced to do very bad things. The fun of a show like this is watching the line that the Buckleys have drawn in the sand move as they get deeper and deeper enmeshed in this world of crime. How would you describe the Buckley family's moral compass? Does the end really justify the means for them?

I think they've worked really, really hard not to do what they're doing. Of course, Cane gets caught up in it, and then Harlan goes in and tries to fix Cane's situation, and then they just end up getting deeper and deeper into it. One of the things that happens from a character standpoint is Harlan reignites [as a person]. Crime agrees with him, and he starts to get back his mojo and his swagger, and that part of him he had been missing. I think Belle says it in the first or second episode: She knows he can see it all ending, and this is a way for him to come back to life a little bit.

 










And, of course, Cane is the one who has to morally figure out: How far is he willing to go? He's never really held a gun, much less pulled the trigger. We watch him go through all of those things, and his moral compass also comes in the form of his high school sweetheart who shows up. She's sort of the road not taken, and she's there to represent every choice he didn't take — and every choice maybe he still could. And if you've seen the show, you know what happens.

The finale ends with Belle seemingly taking the reins of the fishing empire right from under Harlan's nose — and Harlan appears to be none-the-wiser right now. How does that cliffhanger set up a potential second season?

I think Belle, until this point, has stood by her husband. She married into the family. She wasn't a Buckley. And I think it was around the seventh episode when she really lays it out on [Harlan] and she's like, “I earned my name. I earned the name Buckley. I am a Buckley more so than you are.” I think right around there, she's starting to figure out that, “You know what? I can't stand in the shadows anymore. I've sat by, and he just makes a mess, and I'm always there to clean it up. Now I need to get in front of him so he just won't make the mess to start with.” 

 










So I think her point at the end is she's just going to take control the same way Cane got into trouble, and she's just going to just push him aside and stand tall and deal with it. But I think she's going to take control. She knows that she can do it. And then, of course, we have the Parkers [another crime family] who they're now beholden to, and I think there's a whole family there of interesting people. We had one, [played by] Topher Grace, this year. I think we're going to have a few more next year.

How did you land on the endings for the rest of the Buckleys? Given that you put all of them in danger this season, did you ever consider killing any of them off?

Well, we can still do that! I wanted to play out the dynamics of the family. I really love the dynamic between Bree and Cane and how she sees him as the golden boy, and he doesn't feel like a golden boy at all. He sees his sister's trouble, and now they have this third sibling that has entered the mix who's kind of perfect. He actually walks in the door — smart, intelligent, with it all together — and the only thing wrong with him is he's living with some grief and he's looking for a place to belong. It's like, how far will he go to have a family? I think that's going to be Shawn's [Rafael L. Silva] burden next season, which is, exactly how far will he go? Can he become a Buckley — and a true Buckley?

 










This show is a little bit about the sins of our father, and I wanted to put Bree on the right path so that she could perhaps have a whole different point of view next season. So I just wanted to get to the root of her drama, which was what she witnessed [as a child, with the killing of her paternal grandfather] and how [her family] just ignored her alcoholism. So now, maybe she and her brother can come together and fight a bigger enemy. I also wanted to see Cane and his wife, [Danielle Campbell's] Peyton. She was the second choice, and she knows it. She knows she wasn't the first pick. And now, at the end of the season, she is determined to become the first pick. So she's married this guy, she had a child with him, and I think now it's time to see them fall in love. They're doing it in the reverse way.

This show is almost certainly going to draw comparisons to recent shows which have hit the cultural zeitgeist — “Ozark,” “Narcos,” maybe a little bit of “Succession.”

It's not any of those things. [Laughs.]

Be that as it may, people will still try to fit this series into a specific box or genre. As a creator and writer, even though the inspiration for this show is extremely personal, how cognizant are you about creating something that may have widespread appeal and that may tap into the cultural zeitgeist in the same way? Is that something that you ever think about or that an executive has ever brought up to you?
 










I don't think of it maybe the way that you just expressed it — which was great, by the way. I think of it differently. I think of what's not on television right now. What's the show that I want to see? And more importantly, what's a show that I can write that no one else can? What's a show that I could create that no one else can create? I think I'm the only person who could have written that pilot script because I wrote it from a personal place. I wrote it from a place of family. I understand the [fishing] business. I know how it went belly up. And of course, a lot of writers came in and helped with the other episodes, and it was awesome. But I felt like this is a world that no one else was doing, so I chose to do it. I love returning to North Carolina, and I love just living in that landscape. It's beautiful down there. It's still full of so much, so I just want to bring that to the screen.

We're only a few years away from the 30-year anniversary of “Dawson's Creek.” How have you seen the business, and specifically the landscape for TV, evolve?

It's completely different than when I first started, and I didn't know how to make television back then. I was just thrust into it, and it was learn-as-you-go, but I loved it. “Dawson's,” once again, was a very personal story, and no one else was telling that story, so I wanted to tell it. And the same with “Scream” as a movie. No one was making horror movies at that moment. So I said, “Alright, I want to make a horror movie that I want to see. I've seen all the horror movies now. I want to make one that speaks to that.” And that's how “Scream” came about. I think you really just have to look around you and say, “What's not there? What can you bring to this world?”

 










Television has changed so much. We have streaming. There's so many ways everyone can be watching [content]. Part of me just loves it, and part of me is like, “Oh man, I wish we could go back.” But you can watch this hour-long drama and go, “Oh, this is a family drama. I've seen a family drama, but it's not quite like this [other show].” But hopefully, there's something comfortable about it; there's some comfort food there for people to tap into, and they'll just sit back and enjoy the eight episodes and binge them and just have a fun time. That's what I want. We live in a really weird place right now. We're in a weird time in the world, and I just want people to sit back and enjoy something for eight hours. I binge everything, so I'm hoping it's a very bingeable show. That's what we were trying to make — and to entertain and have fun. Those were our goals.

I feel like they were the same goals 20 years ago when TV was in a different world. They're the same ones now — and it's not “Succession.” [Laughs.] This is a story about the Buckleys, and I love “Succession,” but I wouldn't make that comparison. People would be sadly disappointed. I've read that comparison, and I'm like, “Oh no.” [Laughs.]

We also just passed the 15-year anniversary of “Vampire Diaries.” It's so funny to me in retrospect that you and Julie Plec didn't think there would be a demand for more vampire content after “Twilight,” but here we are all these years later, and the genre seems to be en vogue more than ever.
 










You never know what's going to resonate. I wish I had a magic ball, but I don't. I think there's always room for a great vampire story. “Interview with the Vampire” — that book came out in 1976, and now we're seeing it as a TV show. I watched Season 1, and I loved it. So I guess they are en vogue now, but I don't know. I love genre. You're asking someone who just lives in the world of genre, so I'm always going to be up for a good vampire story.

Why do you think vampires have stood the test of time?

Vampires are just dark and sexy and mysterious, and they live on the fringe of society and come out of the dark. I just think this idea that there's this person that could kiss you or bite you — I mean, there's this inherent allure to vampires in their ability to seduce and do everything, and they're very dangerous. I just think they're sexy. I think they're romantic. I think they're scary. They're all those things. So if you tap into a great story with them, it's always fun.

“Vampire Diaries,” was, once again, another very, very personal story. It was me dealing with someone who had died and I was in grief over someone, and I sat down and wrote a story about a dead vampire and a girl who was dead inside, and they brought each other back to life.

 










Out of curiosity, have you seen Ryan Coogler's “Sinners”?

Yes, I have. [Smirks.]

And what did you think?

I really, really loved it. I thought it was awesome, and I loved the little “Faculty” shout-out too. [Williamson penned the screenplay for Robert Rodriguez's 1998 sci-fi horror film, and Coogler cited the film as one of his inspirations.]

You are no stranger to creating iconic love triangles — both on “Dawson's Creek” with Dawson-Joey-Pacey and “Vampire Diaries” with Damon-Elena-Stefan. What do you think are the keys to creating an epic love triangle?

Well, they all three have to be winning; they all three have to be heroes. You can't have a villain in the bunch. That's how I look at it. If you have a villain, then you're going to know exactly who to root for. I think it was so easy to portray Damon as the bad one, and you wanted Elena to pick Stefan. But I think we quickly divulged something very, very personal about Damon that made us realize that maybe there is something in him that can love and maybe love will save it. So we just set it up where everyone has a love for the triangle, but also a want that if they don't get who they want, if they don't get their soulmate, if they don't get the person they love, then it will completely affect the rest of their life.

 










In “Vampire Diaries,” it was so awesome because everything was epic and the stakes were so high all the time, and we were just turned up to a 10 all the time. Our goal was just to make everything epic and then slow it down and surprise the audience every now and then with something tender and sweet. That was another show where we wanted to be shocking, so we'd kill someone in the middle of something.

You are in the middle of doing post-production for “Scream 7,” which will center on Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), and this is your first time in the director's chair since 1999's “Teaching Mrs. Tingle.” Is it true that Neve was responsible for convincing you to direct this sequel?

Yes! It was a Zoom, so she got to see me cry. [Laughs.] No, it was lovely. She called with the studio, and she wanted to be the one to ask me to do it. I think somehow there were all the conversations that were had without me, and then they Zoomed me and asked me, and it was awesome.

What have you made of the experience of returning to “Scream,” and how are you looking to breathe new life into the franchise? [Williamson agreed to direct amid a period of upheaval following the departures of stars Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega.]
 










I don't know. [Imitates the shrug emoji.] Look, we had a blast doing it. It was a wonderful time. I never really left the franchise. I was always there on the sidelines [as an executive producer] throughout it all, and the reason I stepped away was mainly Wes [Craven], because I was like, “Our time has passed. How can I make a ‘Scream' without Wes?” I wasn't going to be a part of any of it, and then I realized I didn't want there to be a “Scream” made without me, so I stayed involved and I'm really glad I did. The same way Wes created a family, I think this group of people have created a family, and it's been quite wonderful to be a part of it.

I can't really talk about it without giving stuff away, but I did go down a road that has never been gone down before, I think… [Pauses.] No, that's not true. Nevermind. That's a lie! [Laughs.] It's “Scream 7.” I did everything I could to make it feel new and fresh, so we'll see what happens.

All episodes of “The Waterfront” are now streaming on Netflix.

While filming Hallmark's latest installment of its popular “Hannah Swensen Mysteries” franchise, Victor Webster realized he had so much fun learning to tango with co-star Alison Sweeney, he's up for a little more dancing — potentially even on live TV. 

The dynamic duo, who play Detective Chad Norton and baker-turned-sleuther Hannah Swensen, had to take dance lessons for a scene that appears in “Pie to Die For: A Hannah Swensen Mystery,” premiering June 22 on Hallmark Channel. 

“Ali definitely picked it up much faster than I did,” Webster told EntertainmentNow, but once he got the hang of it, he said he really enjoyed it, admitting he'd even be open to waltzing onto the cast of ABC's “Dancing With the Stars.” 

A post shared by Ali Sweeney (@alisweeney)

In addition to rehearsing the actual dance steps for their upcoming movie, Webster and Sweeney also had to hold poses as their director — and fellow Hallmark star — Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe captured gorgeous overhead angles and a dramatic scene-ending dip. Webster told EntertainmentNow they “had a great time doing the scene,” but he acknowledged that freezing in place as he and Sweeney looked into each others' eyes during that dip wasn't the easiest thing to film.

“You know, I talked with Ali about it the other day,” he said, “and she was like, ‘One of the hardest things was, you know, to look super relaxed and comfortable while you're, like, laying backwards and being held up and like, you can't put any stress in your neck.' You see stuff on screen — you can't compare that to real life. Like, we have to go through a lot to make that look real, right?”

“Nobody holds that pose,” he said, adding, “Well, maybe somebody on ‘Dancing with the Stars' does.” 

When EntertainmentNow asked if he'd consider competing on DWTS, Webster said, “You know why I would do it? I'm not a reality TV guy, and that's more of a competition show, but my goddaughter wants me to be on that show so badly.” 

Smiling as he thought of his goddaughter Eden, he said, “Like, once a month (she asks), ‘Will you go? Will you go on?' Like, I can't just snap my fingers, sweetheart, and then be on ‘Dancing with the Stars!' But if somebody asked me to do it? For her, I would.”

These days, Webster's open to all kinds of experiences that expand his horizons and zest for life — whether learning to dance, connecting with fans at events like the upcoming Hallmark Christmas Experience and fan cruise with Kristoffer Polaha, or diving into favorite hobbies, including photography and travel. 

Webster told EntertainmentNow that the latest thing he's tried is stand-up comedy. He's been taking a class in Vancouver and will perform his first live set as part of a private graduation event a few days after the “Pie to Die For” premiere. 

“It scares the heck out of me,” Webster admitted, but that's why he decided to do it. “Yeah, I just want to do things that scare me and make me feel alive. I don't know that I want to do stand-up comedy as a job or profession, but I'm doing it because it scares me.” 

Webster said his comedy material is all about dogs, based on his bond with his beloved pup, Nova. 

“I find it incredibly funny,” he said, beaming. “There might be crickets in the audience, but whatever. I find dog stuff incredibly hilarious, stuff that they do. Like, what if humans did the things to other humans that dogs do to each other? So there's a lot of stuff around that I think dog owners will really appreciate.” 

“Pie to Die For: A Hannah Swensen Mystery” premieres on Hallmark Channel at 8 p.m. Eastern time on Hallmark Channel.

“Christiane F.,” the 1981 cult classic nightmare vision of a teen girl's descent into heroin addiction in West Berlin, makes even “The Panic in Needle Park” look like a walk in the, well, you know.

German filmmaker Uli Edel adapted a harrowing nonfiction book by Kai Hermann and Horst Rieck with testimonies from users who haunted the drug-cruising spot at Berlin's Zoo Station, including from Christiane Felscherinow, who was 13 when she fell into the wrong crowd and started shooting up amid the underground club scene. For the film version, Edel cast then-unknown actress Natja Brunckhorst (who would later write her own memoir about her experience making “Christiane F.”) as the David Bowie-worshipping teen addict experimenting with first love and drug use. Felscherinow eventually became an actress and musician herself.

Now, a new 4K restoration from Janus Films of “Christiane F.” opens at Film at Lincoln Center starting June 20, with screenings on the West Coast at the Los Feliz Theatre in Los Angeles. Edel takes a decidedly non-moralistic approach to capturing the actual drug-addled youth who populated Berlin in the '70s; at one point, Christiane (Brunckhorst) stumbles in a bleary daze through a tunnel lined with strung-out punks, needles hanging out of their arms and their eyes glazed over. It's one of many documentary-like moments in “Christiane F.,” as the filmmakers captured real users in the underpass. As for the graphic nudity among minors seen in the film, that's now illegal, but the first-time actors' parents consented at the time.

 










Justus Pankau and Jürgen Jürges' cinematography likely hasn't looked this shockingly vivid since the film's 1981 release, when Roger Ebert called it “one of the most horrifying movies I have ever seen.” Edel captures the jet-black streets at night and the bunker-like postwar subterranean of Berlin in a way that feels oddly romantic and nostalgia-worthy — especially under the gleaming neon signage of the trendy discotheque Sound — without ever romanticizing a youth-culture-killing drug epidemic.

“Christiane F.” also stands out for its soundtrack, supplied by David Bowie with songs from the albums “Heroes” (including the title track, playing almost triumphantly as Christiane joins a marauding band of street kids wreaking havoc in a mall), “Station to Station,” “Lodger,” and “Low.” There's even an excerpted David Bowie concert, originally shot in New York, juxtaposed with audience shots from an AC/DC concert in West Germany. Bowie's inclusion makes for a cutting contrast between the doomy glamor of Berlin's late-'70s club scene with the darkness thrumming beneath it.

Edel, working from Herman Weigel's screenplay, neither shies away from the brutality of Christiane's plunge into underage sex work nor the cold-turkey withdrawal hell she experiences with her boyfriend (Thomas Haustein), where they end up scrambling desperately for another fix. Once clean and with help from her mother to get sober, Christiane thinks she can handle one more shot in the arm, but that proves impossible as she's thrown into more tragic circumstances.

 










“Christiane F.” functions on its own terms as a piece of provocative pure cinema, but it's also in a social dialogue with the rise of cautionary tales like the controversial American “memoir” “Go Ask Alice” from 1971, which charts a 15-year-old girl's self-destruction and was later deemed fiction. The book was used as an educational tool to warn kids off drug use, a tradition of agenda-driven anti-drug art that began with the American exploitation movie “Reefer Madness” in the 1930s, and of course continued with myriad after-school specials. (Helen Hunt in “Desperate Lives,” anyone?) “Christiane F.” inadvertently might have served the same purpose, but Edel isn't chasing moral instruction here. He's capturing a moment, a milieu, and it's one that the real-life Christiane eventually pulled herself out of, unlike many of her friends.

Janus Films‘ 4K restoration of “Christiane F.” opens at Film at Lincoln Center on Friday, June 20.

According to “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” executive producer and head writer Molly McNearney, being a late night writer requires a really thick skin, “because 90 percent of what you're writing in the morning as you're crying reading the news is rejected. So we are a bunch of losers,” she joked during a recent panel.

During the panel, held inside the  “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” studio in Hollywood, as seen in the exclusive video above, McNearney was joined by fellow EP and head writer Danny Ricker, who added, “That's your first rejection of the day, by the way. It's just another 12 hours of that.” Gary Greenberg, co-head writer and supervising producer on the show also appeared on the panel, and said, “There's home and away rejections,” clarifying that all those jokes that get pitched in the morning are sent in by the writers working from home, before they come to the studio ready to share new ideas that may or may not make the episode.

“Everybody puts their initials on their pitches,” said Josh Halloway, also a co-head writer and supervising producer on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” “It's stressful, but it's such a good check of your work ethic because you can't phone in something that's going to have your initials over it,” said Ricker. “There's an element of accountability and stakes,” said Halloway.

 










Keep in mind, just from that morning pitch session, which starts at 7 a.m. and ends at 8:50 a.m., the writers generate 40 pages of ideas that are then sent to Kimmel, and usually whittled down to two or three pages. “It's really probably one of the most stressful parts of being a late night writer. One of the most fun parts too, where you can come up with a sketch idea and you're like, ‘OK, I was half awake in my sweatpants when I came up with this.' And then, ‘Oh, all of a sudden Jimmy wants to do it.' And you start getting calls from our production team,” said Ricker. “‘OK, we found a house already to shoot in. We cast a pope, and you said, you want two dogs? That's kind of expensive. Can we do one dog?' You go, ‘Yeah, that's fine.' And then you're on site shooting a sketch that then comes back here, and gets edited and shown to Jimmy. And Jimmy gives lots of notes.” 

In fact, Halloway revealed that when they have a working monologue script on Google Docs, complete with clip cues and everything, Kimmel “goes in like a Pacman and edits it and chases us. You need to be a little bit ahead so that he won't catch up to you. And he's very fast,” said the writer. “He is physically rewriting the monologue and he's obviously using what the group is doing, but he's making it his own.”

 










Given the state of the world, there are more and more days where the team will then have to flip the script in order to keep that night's episode as topical as possible. It helps that a small number of writers submit their jokes in the afternoon, but everyone tries to be adaptable, especially Kimmel. “It's not great for your nervous system, but it's very exciting with this team of people. They're so good at it. And Jimmy's so good at just being flexible and pivoting, and I love us all getting in a room and just [saying] ‘OK, what are we doing now?,'” said McNearney.

“Jimmy always said to us, our directive is to talk about the things that people are talking about. And so whenever that happens to happen, we need the pivot,” said Ricker. Greenberg recalls one particular pitch he was excited about, that did not make it to air to account for the news of the day: “We got a stuffed raccoon with the meth pipe in an RC car trying to go in the studio. Trump fucked that up.”

Politics has changed the show in such a way to where Kimmel hardly ever makes jokes about TV shows like “American Idol,” but the silver lining has been the material becoming more personal. “We're not journalists. He's a comedian. So there's always a fine balance of, can we be funny? Can we not be funny? We need to, what's going to happen? And those times are a little more darkly stressful,” said McNearney. “I actually feel so much closer to the people I work with because I feel like we're all on this team for good, whether people are listening or not, it feels good to at least have a place to put it.”

 










As the summer approaches, the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” writers are preparing for the late night comedian to take a vacation, with a bevy of celebrity guest hosts taking his place — a challenge that is pretty unique to their show. “It feels like a totally different job from how it is with Jimmy,” said Ricker. “Many aspects of it are the same, and we're in this same studio and all that kind of stuff. But there are times where sometimes we'll get somebody here and we'll go, ‘Oh, you have never read a teleprompter before? Alright, it's time for teleprompter school.' And then they'll stand right here, and they'll try it, and they'll go ‘Should I wait for the audience to stop laughing before I tell the next joke?' And we go, ‘Yes, you should do that. Great idea.'”

The head writer added, “We have gotten to work with such an insanely fun array of people to guest host the show,” even the pair of actors who led the most successful live action film of 2024. “Last year, our corporate overlords at Disney were like, ‘Hey, do you want Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman to host a show?' We go, ‘We sure do.' And they go, ‘Alright, they can get there at 12:30.' And we tape our show at 4:00,” said Ricker. “So we met them for the first time at 12:30. And we're like, ‘You're doing a show in three and a half hours with us. Great, here we go.' And we sat at this desk and we wrote the whole monologue. And that was such a pressure cooker situation. But when we have a host that gets dropped in who's just great and excited to do it, there's this really fun adrenaline that comes with that.”

 










Halloway said, “We decided after the first summer that it would be better for the hosts and for the staff if we just did a mini version of our show. So we really do write it the day of with those guest hosts. We don't just write it ahead of time because then it doesn't feel like we're doing our show, and it doesn't feel like they're doing our show. And so it really is a lot. It's a fast version of what we've just talked through with the difference that there is more talking and we rehearse more.”

Sharing his experience of quickly training these guest hosts, Greenberg said, “We've had actors on, and in the rehearsal they would deliver a joke and they'd kind of swallow the punchline and we'd say, ‘That's the punchline.' And they'd say, ‘Well, I want the audience to believe that I really mean it.' And I'm like, ‘No, you just want him to laugh.' Don't do that.”

“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” has had around 100 guest hosts, meaning that the writing staff has become “able to channel that and work and write in all these different people's voices,” said an impressed Halloway. After their time on the show, the guest hosts “also all leave here and they don't understand how Jimmy does this,” said McNearney. “They're like, ‘How the hell do you guys do this every single night?'”

“Twin Peaks: The Return” is returning to the screen, and this time, it's the big one. IndieWire announces that the Metrograph theater in Lower Manhattan will host a weekend-long marathon of the 2017 David Lynch series, as presented with Mubi.

The two-day marathon will take place July 5 and 6 to mark the 35th anniversary of Lynch and Mark Frost's original “Twin Peaks.” The sequel series, also known as “Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series,” debuted on Showtime in 2017; it's one of late director Lynch's final projects.

“Twin Peaks” composer Dean Hurley will be in attendance to introduce the series at for select showtimes, and will also participate in a special pre-screening conversation.

“Twin Peaks” first premiered in 1990 on ABC. The second season aired in 1991 before being canceled by the network; it was later revived in 2017 with “Twin Peaks: The Return.” The first two seasons of “Twin Peaks” followed FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) as he investigates the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in the border town of Twin Peaks. MacLachlan, as well as many other members of the ensemble cast, reprised their roles for “Twin Peaks: The Return,” which Lynch directed. The sequel series is set 25 years after Laura Palmer's murder. All seasons of both iterations of “Twin Peaks” are now streaming on Mubi.

 










Check out the full schedule for the Metrograph marathon, with language provided by the theater, below. 

Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series || Parts 1-3Saturday, July 5 – 12:00 p.m.Introduction by composer Dean Hurley.

In which FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper appears where last we left him, trapped now for 25 years in the Black Lodge, while his psychopathic, stringy-haired doppelgänger leaves a trail of destruction behind him on our terrestrial plane. Escaping the Lodge following a visit to a fortress-like structure towering over a wine-colored sea, Cooper returns to Earth in the body of a second manufactured doppelgänger, or tulpa, called Dougie Jones, a corrupt and debt-riddled employee of the Lucky 7 Insurance agency in Las Vegas, whom he replaces while Jones is shacked up with an escort named Jade. Jade, finding “Jones” (in fact Cooper) disoriented and incoherent, lacking all memory of his identity and the basic niceties of human interaction, drops the seeming idiot at a nearby casino, where he promptly wins 30 megajackpots in a row.  

Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series || Parts 4-6Saturday, July 5 – 3:30 p.m.

In which an amnesiac FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, having taken the place on Earth of one Dougie Jones, returns to “his” suburban “home” and “wife,” Janey-E, with the proceeds of 30 megajackpots, and attempts to adjust to Jones's routine at Lucky 7 Insurance as organized crime figures conspire to punish an oblivious Cooper for Jones's past transgressions. In Twin Peaks, Deputy Chief Hawk and Sheriff Frank Truman—filling in for ailing brother Frank—work on following a lead phoned in by an ailing Log Lady, while Richard Horne, son of Audrey Horne and Cooper's evil double, spiraling into depravity and addiction, kills a child in a hit-and-run. Further afield FBI Deputy Director Gordon Cole and agents Albert Rosenfield and Tammy Rosenfield investigate reports of a sighting of Cooper—the aforementioned doppelgänger—in South Dakota, eventually linking up with his former assistant, the heretofore unseen Diane.

 










Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series || Parts 7-9Saturday, July 5 – 7:15 p.m.Pre-screening conversation with composer Dean Hurley on his creative collaboration with David Lynch.

In which Deputy Chief Hawk and Sheriff Frank Truman puzzle over clues as to the location of the long-missing FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, while Cooper's wicked doppelgänger appears to be killed in a shootout in South Dakota with criminal associate Ray Monroe. In White Sands, New Mexico, 1945, the first atomic bomb is detonated. Eleven years later two disheveled woodsmen emerge from the New Mexico desert to violently occupy a local radio station, from which they broadcast the cryptic phrase: “This is the water and this is the well. Drink full and descend. The horse is the white of the eyes and dark within.” A creature, part insect, part bullfrog, freshly hatched from an egg, crawls down the throat of a sleeping young woman. Nine Inch Nails perform. Back in Twin Peaks, Jerry Horne is convinced that his foot is talking.  

Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series || Parts 10-12Sunday, July 6 – 12:00 p.m.

In which Janey-E, noticing that “husband” Dougie Jones has become considerably more fit and trim since his mysterious episode—in fact, his replacement with an amnesiac FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper—rediscovers the joys of the matrimonial bed. In Twin Peaks, Richard Horne continues on his violent spree; the Sheriff's department, with help from an ailing Log Lady, continue to attempt to decipher a trail of cryptic clues, auguries, and warnings (“There's fire where you're going”); and an unhinged Audrey Horne relentlessly henpecks her meek husband, Charlie, demanding he assist in helping her find her missing lover. FBI Deputy Director Gordon Cole's team, who've been investigating a savage and wholly inexplicable (double?) murder in Buckhorn, South Dakota, discover a tattoo on the arm of one of the decedents, coordinates that point them towards Twin Peaks, Washington State.

 










Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series || Parts 13-15Sunday, July 6 – 3:30 p.m.

In which the amnesiac Dale Cooper, having assumed the place of unscrupulous Las Vegas insurance agent Dougie Jones, disarms with his guilelessness all those who would wish ill will upon Jones as payback for his misdeeds or cover-up for their own, while Cooper's homicidal doppelgänger, having survived an attempt on his life, is reunited with his equally bloodthirsty son, Richard Horne. James Hurley gives a moving performance at the Road House outside of Twin Peaks, and learns of an unusual vision experienced by his cockney co-worker at Great Northern security, Freddie, who will defend James from the attack of a jealous husband with a most unusual strength-enhancing glove. At a local dive, Sarah Palmer, long a confirmed drunk, teaches a rude trucker a lesson he won't soon forget, or in fact live to remember. The Log Lady, feeling death's chill, calls Deputy Chief Hawk to bid him goodbye: “My log is turning gold. The wind is moaning.”

Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series || Parts 16-18Sunday, July 6 – 7:15 p.m.Introduction by composer Dean Hurley.

In which Dale Cooper's doppelgänger sends his own son, Richard Horne, to a dreadful death by electrocution before heading for Twin Peaks, there to be shot down by fast-acting receptionist Lucy Moran, his corpse unleashing an orb inhabited by the corrupting spirit of BOB which will subsequently be pummeled into submission by Freddie, a cockney lad who followed a beckoning dream to Twin Peaks, here fulfilling his predestined purpose. The real Cooper, freshly awakened from a coma induced by sticking a fork in an electrical socket, his long-absent memory restored, arrives shortly thereafter, thence to be transported back in time to the night of the murder of Laura Palmer, which brought him to Twin Peaks so many years ago. Preventing the murder and causing a disturbance in the timeline, Cooper eventually finds himself at a diner in Odessa, Texas, where he encounters a waitress who is the spitting image of Palmer. Believing her to be the missing girl, now in middle age, he drives her to the Palmer home in Twin Peaks for a happy family reunion, but our misguided Perceval has not found his Grail. “What… year is it?”

Don't you just love it when two worlds collide? That's exactly what happened when Henry Winkler lent a helping hand to Marlee Matlin during a critical time in her life. 

Not only did the “Happy Days” star offer support, but he literally saved the life of the 59-year-old actress, who has spoken openly about their enduring friendship.

Matlin and Winkler's connection began early in her career when she was just 12-years-old. Winkler first saw her perform on stage at a variety show in Chicago. At the time, Matlin's mother urged Winkler to discourage her daughter from pursuing acting, worried about the challenges a deaf actress would face. Winkler recalled telling her mother, “You got the wrong guy.”

From that moment, Winkler became a steadfast mentor and friend to Matlin, a bond that has lasted decades. “He was probably one of the most famous people in the world at times—more famous than the President, in my opinion—and one of the most beloved,” Matlin shared. “Who would have thought he'd take the time to give attention to a little deaf girl like me, especially when he didn't even know American Sign Language?”

“I think anyone who has a mentor like that would understand how important he was to me.”

Matlin's new documentary, “Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore,” premieres on June 20th and explores several personal chapters of her life. This includes her troubled relationship with the late actor William Hurt. Hurt, who passed away in 2022 at age 71, was described by Matlin as a “habit of abuse.”

The two met on the set of “Children of a Lesser God” in 1986, when Matlin was just 19. Hurt was 35. Despite the difficulties, Hurt encouraged Matlin to seek help for substance abuse, leading her to check into the Betty Ford Center. There, she received treatment for marijuana and cocaine addiction. Yet Matlin made it clear that once she left the toxic relationship, she never returned. “I walked out of that house and never went back,” she said.

During this challenging time, Matlin leaned heavily on Winkler. Speaking through an interpreter with Fox News Digital, she described how Winkler and his wife, Stacey Weitzman, opened their home. “He didn't make it hard for me to reach out. He was always available. It was like an open door to his heart and to mine. And he knew that,” she said.

Matlin praised Winkler's kindness and unwavering support. “He's done this for so many people. But to have that close relationship with him and his wife… I was very fortunate. I don't think if I had Henry in my life, I would be here today. I really don't.”

Winkler recalled the moment Matlin asked for help in the documentary. “She said, ‘I just broke up with my boyfriend. Can I stay with you just for the weekend?' And I said, ‘Sure.' Then I asked Stacey, and she said, ‘Of course.'” Matlin revealed that Winkler and his wife treated her like family, welcoming her with open arms.

To everyone's surprise, including Winkler's, Matlin stayed much longer than a weekend. “Two years later, she finally moved out!” Winkler chuckled.

He also shared the advice he gave her during that time, saying, “If you know what you want, without ambivalence, if you're clear about what you want, everything else will fall into place.”

Their relationship continued to deepen through the year. So much so that in 1993, Matlin asked Winkler for one more favor, to host her wedding. She married her husband, Kevin Grandalsi, in Winkler's backyard.

“You just knew it was different, that this was where a home is made,” Winkler said in the film. “There was no other place for her to get married except in our yard—her home away from home.”

Matlin reflected on the profound impact Winkler had on her life. “He provided a place where I felt safe. I could always depend on him, knowing he genuinely believed in me. He helped me build my self-confidence and trust, and he allowed me to be open and see the world more clearly.”

Despite not knowing much about deaf culture, Winkler never treated Matlin differently. “He didn't ignore the fact that I'm deaf, but he treated me with love and respect, just like anyone should. I knew from the moment we met that he was the real deal.”

“Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore” premieres on June 20th, offering an intimate look at the actress's journey and the powerful friendship that helped her survive and thrive.

The shocking lawsuit from Terrance "T.A." Dixon comes months after Fat Joe sued him first, claiming Dixon was making "extortionate demands" about false abuse allegations.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Two months after Fat Joe sued his former hypeman Terrance “T.A.” Dixon for extortion over “false and vile accusations,” the one-time employee has filed his own lawsuit accusing the rapper of having sex with two underage girls.


	In a complaint filed Thursday in Manhattan federal court, Dixon accuses Fat Joe (Joseph Cartagena) of a “deliberate and sustained campaign of exploitation,” leveling claims of sex trafficking, financial fraud, and racketeering. Most seriously, Dixon claims that he “personally witnessed defendant engage in sexual relations with children who were fifteen and sixteen years old.”

	“Minor Doe 1 is a 16-year-old Dominican girl residing in New York,” Dixon writes in his lawsuit, obtained by Billboard. “In exchange for cash, clothing, and payment of her cell phone bill, defendant would get oral sex and other sexual acts performed on him by Minor Doe 1.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Those explosive allegations come two months after Fat Joe sued Dixon and his attorney, Tyrone Blackburn, over claims that they were extorting him by making “wholly fabricated, grotesque, and scandalous allegations,” including “unspeakable acts such as pedophilia.”


	In a statement responding to the new case, Fat Joe's lawyer Joe Tacopina called them a “blatant act of retaliation” and a “desperate attempt to deflect attention from the civil suit we filed first.”


	“Law enforcement is aware of the extortionate demand at the heart of this scheme,” Tacopina says. “The allegations against Mr. Cartagena are complete fabrications — lies intended to damage his reputation and force a settlement through public pressure. Mr. Cartagena will not be intimidated. We have taken legal action to expose this fraudulent campaign and hold everyone involved accountable.”


	Asked by Billboard about Tacopina's statement regarding law enforcement, Blackburn repeatedly referred to his opposing counsel by the name Joe Taco Bell: “We offered Joe Taco Bell an opportunity for his client and me to meet at the [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York] to file our respective criminal complaints and he tucked his tail between his legs and never responded. We met with law enforcement. Let's see where this goes.”


	In his Thursday complaint, Dixon says he dedicated his “talent, labor, and loyalty” to Fat Joe for 16 years, serving not just as a hype man but also a “lyricist, background vocalist, security team member, and creative collaborator.” But he says the star manipulated and abused him in myriad ways, ranging from underpayment to threatening his life.


	“Defendants systematically engaged in coercive labor exploitation, financial fraud, sexual manipulation, violent intimidation, and psychological coercion against plaintiff Dixon, all intended to enrich defendant Cartagena and his associates while deliberately suppressing, silencing, and erasing plaintiff's substantial creative, artistic, and commercial contributions, which were foundational to defendant Cartagena's professional success and personal brand,” Blackburn writes on Dixon's behalf.


	That's a very different story from the one that Fat Joe himself told first in April, when he sued Dixon and Blackburn for defamation over “a predatory plot, built entirely on lies, to destroy Cartagena's reputation and business for profit.”


	In that case, the star says he “compensated Dixon handsomely” and the hype man “never complained or expressed any dissatisfaction.” But he says the ex-staffer recently started airing false grievances about his pay and other issues, and has published “shocking falsehoods” to social media while making “outrageous financial demands.”


	The early lawsuit also names Dixon's lawyers as a defendant, claiming Blackburn threatened to file baseless legal action. Citing a recent ruling by a New York federal judge that sharply criticized Blackburn's litigation tactics, the suit calls his behavior “shakedown tactics masquerading as lawyering.”


	“Dixon's and Blackburn's conduct is … a cold-blooded attempt to extort exorbitant sums from Cartagena by leveraging the specter of public disgrace and professional ruin,” Tacopina wrote in April. “His defamatory statements accusing Cartagena of heinous crimes are devoid of any factual foundation, relying instead on the power of shock, scandal and Cartagena's high-profile status to maximize leverage.”


	The allegations about Fat Joe in the newer case are certainly shocking and scandalous. The complaint is 157 pages – far longer than the typical pleadings in such a case – and comes with an unusual bright red “trigger warning” at the top. It is also replete with photos of the alleged teenage victims, and claims that Dixon faced “credible threats” to his life, including “attempts to lure him into a violent ambush.”


	The lawsuit also includes claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act – the federal “RICO” statute often used in criminal cases against mobsters and drug cartels. Those sprawling claims allege that Fat Joe and his associates operated an illicit enterprise, and also names a number of outside groups as defendants, including Jay-Z's Roc Nation.


	Blackburn included similar civil RICO claims in a sexual assault case he filed last year against Sean “Diddy” Combs on behalf of producer Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones. While a judge has allowed the case to move forward, he dismissed the racketeering claims in March.

Danny Boyle is still “proud” of his Best Picture Oscar winner “Slumdog Millionaire,” even while acknowledging that, as a white British director, he could not make the Bollywood-influenced Mumbai epic today. 

Boyle told The Guardian that his 2008 film, in hindsight, carries a weight of “cultural appropriation” despite working with “a big Indian crew.” Boyle also said “Slumdog Millionaire” would not get financed today with a director such as himself attached.

“We wouldn't be able to make that now,” Boyle said. “And that's how it should be. It's time to reflect on all that. We have to look at the cultural baggage we carry and the mark that we've left on the world.”

He continued, “I mean, I'm proud of the film, but you wouldn't even contemplate doing something like that today. It wouldn't even get financed. Even if I was involved, I'd be looking for a young Indian filmmaker to shoot it.”

When asked if “Slumdog Millionaire” could be considered a form of cinematic “colonialism,” Boyle said, “No, no…Well, only in the sense that everything is. At the time it felt radical. We made the decision that only a handful of us would go to Mumbai. We'd work with a big Indian crew and try to make a film within the culture. But you're still an outsider. It's still a flawed method. That kind of cultural appropriation might be sanctioned at certain times. But at other times it cannot be.”

 










“Slumdog Millionaire” made $378 million at the worldwide box office against a $15 million budget. The Fox Searchlight Pictures release centered on an Indian teenager (Dev Patel), who grew up in the slums of Mumbai and is accused of cheating during the country's version of “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” Freida Pinto, Anil Kapoor, and late actor Irrfan Khan co-starred. The film later won eight Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy loosely adapted the film from the novel “Q & A” by Vikas Swarup. “Slumdog Millionaire” is listed low, at #85, on IndieWire's ranking of all 97 Best Picture winners.

Fat Joe‘s former hype man has accused the rapper of “coercive labor exploitation, financial fraud, sexual manipulation, violent intimidation, and psychological coercion” in a lengthy lawsuit filed Thursday, Variety reports. The former employee, Terrance “T.A.” Dixon, is also reportedly alleging that the rapper, real name Joseph Antonio Cartagena, built his empire while deliberately suppressing, silencing, and erasing Dixon's “substantial” creative and commercial contributions. Dixon now seeks up to $20 million in damages.

The 157-page filing reportedly contains so many disturbing claims of sexual violence—including with minors—that it has a trigger warning on the first page. Dixon suggests that Cartagena forced him into “humiliating situations, including sex acts performed under duress and surveillance, accompanied by threats of abandonment in foreign countries if [he] refused compliance.” Over time, he estimates that he was “coerced into more than 4,000 sexual acts to maintain his standing within the Enterprise.”

The suit also alleges that Dixon “personally witnessed [Fat Joe] engage in sexual relations with children who were fifteen and sixteen years old,” including a 16-year-old girl who “in exchange for cash, clothing, and payment of her cell phone bill … would [perform] oral sex and other sexual acts,” a 15-year-old girl who “due to Minor Doe 2's body being adolescent and not fully formed, Defendant paid for her to get a Brazilian Butt Lift,” and a third 15-year-old, who Cartagena was allegedly “in love with.” 

Dixon also claims that he was forced to engage in sex acts including in “repeated orgies involving Plaintiff, female dancers and minors,” which he alleges were filmed or watched by Cartagena, corporate security staff, and other members of Cartagena's entourage. “[Dixon] did not willingly consent to participate in these acts; instead, Plaintiff submitted solely out of fear of immediate retaliation, which Defendant repeatedly demonstrated would include financial punishment, professional sabotage, abandonment in foreign countries, or physical harm,” the suit continues. 

The filing also names Pete “Pistol Pete” Torres and Richard “Rich Player” Jospitre, alleged key associates in Fat Joe's “criminal enterprise,” as defendants. They stand accused of civil claims for violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (civil RICO) as well as other violations under New York and Florida law including “unjust enrichment, quantum meruit, fraudulent concealment, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and money laundering.” Jay-Z's Roc Nation is also accused of “concealing, transferring, and manipulating” Dixon's authorship rights and royalty interests related to Fat Joe's music. 

Dixon is represented by Tyrone Blackburn, who also represented a case against Sean “Diddy” Combs. “This is the right way to fight Joe—through the system. You can't fight him no other way,” Dixon told Variety. “Joe think he's a god. Joe thinks he's untouchable.” 

Cartagena, on the other hand, is represented by Joe Tacopina, who also defended Donald Trump and A$AP Rocky in the past. Tacopina previously helped Cartagena sue Dixon in April over posts on social media claiming that the rapper had flown a minor across state lines for sex. “The lawsuit filed by Tyrone Blackburn and Terrance Dixon is a blatant act of retaliation—a desperate attempt to deflect attention from the civil suit we filed first, which exposed their coordinated scheme to extort Mr. Cartagena through lies, threats, and manufactured allegations,” Tacopina said of the new suit in a statement. “Law enforcement is aware of the extortionate demand at the heart of this scheme. The allegations against Mr. Cartagena are complete fabrications—lies intended to damage his reputation and force a settlement through public pressure. Mr. Cartagena will not be intimidated. We have taken legal action to expose this fraudulent campaign and hold everyone involved accountable.”

Mariah Carey's newest Hot 100 entry has Lambs reflecting on elite chart history.

Or, reach out on Bluesky.


Let's open the latest mailbag.


	“Mariah Carey's latest hit is a great achievement, considering she is a legacy artist on the Billboard Hot 100. Out of her 50 career entries, 19 are No. 1s and, by the end of the year, she may hold the record for the longest-running No. 1, ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You.'

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“On a side note, Mariah has Hot 100 No. 1s in eras dominated by physical releases (1990s), digital distribution (2000s) and streaming (‘10s, ‘20s).”


	Filoteo Uy(on Billboard's Facebook)


Lambs are smiling this week, as Carey claims her 50th Hot 100 hit, “Type Dangerous.”


	The feat had Carey fans, and chart fans, noting the impressive percentage of her career entries that have gone to No. 1 or the top 10 on the Hot 100. With 50 making for easy math (phew), her 19 No. 1s translate to a 38% success rate in ruling the chart, while her 28 top 10s make for 56% of her charted titles hitting the top 10.


	How do those numbers compare to others over the Hot 100's nearly 67-year history?

	











	Twenty-five acts have notched eight or more Hot 100 No. 1s. Among them, here's a ranking of the artists with the highest rate of chart entries having hit No. 1, through the survey dated June 21.


Artist, Percentage of Hot 100 Entries Hitting No. 1:


	George Michael reigns with the best percentage of Hot 100 hits reaching No. 1, at 42%. In baseball terms, that's a Ted Williams-esque .420 batting average. Carey follows at a likewise Cooperstown-worthy .380.


	Notably, Michael's total covers only his solo Hot 100 hits, including Wham!'s “Careless Whisper,” on which he's also listed as a solo featured artist. If rolling up the duo's history — three No. 1s among nine entries — into his as a soloist, Michael would still rank first with a 39% rate of topping the Hot 100, just above Carey's 38%.


	Clearly, the relatively recent evolution of music consumption works against this stat, as Drake (4%), Taylor Swift (5%) and The Weeknd (6%) round out the ranking above. Unlike in prior eras, so-called album bombs have swelled certain acts' totals of charted hits — and in a week that Swift holds the top 14 titles, only one can be No. 1. If anything, their placements on the list above make for a badge of honor, with Drake boasting a record 358 career entries and Swift, a runner-up 264.


	How about artists' rates of hitting the Hot 100's top 10?

	











	Again, in looking at the 25 artists with eight or more Hot 100 No. 1s, here's a rundown of the acts with the highest frequencies to date of chart entries having hit the top 10.


Artist, Percentage of Hot 100 Entries Hitting the Top 10:


	George Michael again takes top honors, with a lofty 79% of the late singer-songwriter's Hot 100 hits having reached the top 10. (His only four that didn't: “Waiting for That Day,” No. 27 peak, 1991; the song's B-side that became popular amid the Gulf War, “Mother's Pride,” No. 46, 1991; “Somebody to Love,” with Queen, No. 30, 1993; and “Killer”/“Papa Was a Rollin' Stone,” No. 69, 1993.)


	As with his percentage of No. 1s, Michael would still rank first on the list above if factoring in Wham!, whose nine Hot 100 hits have resulted in seven top 10s — an almost identical high rate, 78%, to his 79% solo. It took some time for the totals to nearly align: Following its 1984 release, Wham!'s “Last Christmas” jingled to the top 10 at last in 2021, reaching a No. 3 best this past holiday season. (Michael is also two-for-two on songs named “Freedom.”)


	Carey has the eighth-best rate of Hot 100 charted titles making the top 10, and the fourth-best among women, after Janet Jackson, Madonna and Whitney Houston, with all four driven largely by their sterling track records (of tracks, or records) in the ‘80s and/or ‘90s.


	Two coincidences stand out above. Paul McCartney has hit the Hot 100's top 10 with 48.9% of his solo entries on the chart, just a touch above the Beatles' 48.6% showing. Meanwhile, it takes three decimal points for Swift (22.348%) to place just above Drake (22.346%) when it comes to their titles reaching the top 10.

	











	One other act comes to mind regarding this research. Of the 307 artists with at least five Hot 100 top 10s, only one has perfect attendance in terms of all its entries on the chart having reached the top 10. In fact, all five hit the top five, and three ascended to No. 1 — “Baby Don't Forget My Number,” “Girl I'm Gonna Miss You” and “Blame It on the Rain” all led, “Girl You Know It's True” hit No. 2 and final charted single “All or Nothing” peaked at No. 4.


	Milli Vanilli, thus, owns a unique slice of Hot 100 history, even if it's somewhat owed to the abrupt end of its chart run. Perhaps the mark adds further shine to the pair, which in recent years has been looked upon much more kindly than when it was always a lock for the chart's upper reaches.

"I'll be your shotgun rider for life," Cyrus wrote.

Miley Cyrus came out of nowhere and didn't give no warning when she made a surprise appearance at Beyoncé‘s Cowboy Carter concert at the Stade de France stadium in Paris on Thursday (June 19).


	The “Flowers” singer shared a video of the on her social media pages, showing the two vocal powerhouses delivering the live debut of their Billboard Hot 100 No. 6 hit “II Most Wanted” off Cowboy Carter, with the two trading off lyrics while dazzling in complementary gold outfits. “Didn't know what I wanted 'til I saw your face/ Say goodbye to the old me,” Bey croons from the first verse before Cyrus kicks off the chorus as the two go on to blend their voices together.

	











	After her unexpected performance, Cyrus shared her excitement about taking the stage with Queen Bey in an Instagram post on Friday (June 20). “@beyonce to be beside such a humble, gracious, legendary DIVA was a dream come true. Thank you for the opportunity to perform in Paris together & sing our song about friendship,” she wrote in the carousel post, which included a clip of their performance as well as photos of the two together on stage. “To have learned from you & loved you my whole life, & then be standing together in matching gold looks is more than I could've imagined. As the finale to this trip supporting Something Beautiful, to close on something as beautiful as a stadium full of people singing ‘II Most Wanted' with us was the ultimate firework. Thank you B. I'll be your shotgun rider for life. Big gratitude to the Cowboy Carter tour crew, you all were incredible for making this happen. Forever and always.”

	In a separate video from backstage, Cyrus struts in her gold bodysuit. “Little ol' me showing up in Paris in Alexander McQueen for Queen Bey. What?” she says sassily, showing off the outfit and flipping her hair.


	The three-time Grammy winner was already in Paris for an intimate Spotify Billions Club Live performance, which took place on Wednesday. During the set — which will be turned into a concert film — the pop star performed some of her biggest hits on the music streaming platform, and also did a surprise mashup of “The Climb” and “We Can't Stop.”

	An archival recording of the original Blues Brothers — John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd — performing live, The Lost Recordings, will arrive this October. 


	The release coincides with a new graphic novel, The Blues Brothers: The Escape of Joliet Jake, written by Aykroyd's daughter Stella, Luke Pisano (son of Belushi's widow, Judy Belushi Pisano), and filmmaker and writer James Werner. The album, pressed on “royal blue” vinyl, is only available as part of a package with the graphic novel. The release, available to preorder now, coincides with the 45th anniversary of the release of the movie The Blues Brothers.


	Judy Belushi Pisano recently rediscovered the live album, which features 13 previously unreleased recordings. The musicians backing up “Joliet” Jake E. Blues and Elwood J. Blues (Belushi and Aykroyd, respectively) are the original band members, a who's who of notable soul men and bluesmen: members of Booker T. and the M.G.'s, the Bar-Kays, Howlin' Wolf's band, and the Saturday Night Live band at the time, including Steve Cropper, Donald “Duck” Dunn, Matt Murphy, and Paul Shaffer. The set list includes songs that appeared on the group's 1978 album, Briefcase Full of Blues.

	











	Dan Aykroyd, who provided editorial oversight and wrote a foreword for the graphic novel, spoke highly of the comic, which Felipe Sobriero illustrated, in a statement. “In this wonderful form of printed artistic expression we get to continue the legend of Jake and Elwood and pass it forward in ways that film can't,” he said. “This graphic novel keeps the spirit of the Blues Brothers alive; mischievous recidivists, musical outlaws who above everything care about the blues.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The story in the graphic novel picks up 10 years after the events of the eponymous 1980 movie, as Joliet Jake disappears from prison under mysterious circumstances. Did he break out or was he kidnapped? A new group of people attempt to find out.


	“The quest for the Briefcase, full of unearthed lyrics and music from the greats, is an honorable Grail,” Aykroyd said. “The Blues Brothers: The Escape of Joliet Jake is a passing of the legacy to the next generation, echoing the true heart of our original story — keeping alive what should not be forgotten.”

	In addition to the deluxe edition, which includes the vinyl, publisher Z2 Comics has also put together a “platinum edition” of the graphic novel, which includes a framed plaque signed by Aykroyd. It has also produced T-shirts with Sobriero's art.


	The Blues Brothers debuted on Saturday Night Live in a 1976 sketch, when they performed “I'm a King Bee” in bee outfits. Belushi and Aykroyd developed it further, wearing suits and sunglasses, on the show in 1978, and the novelty of seeing a couple of ultra-serious white guys deadpanning as blues aficionados became a hit. Briefcase Full of Blues came out that year and was a Number One hit on the Billboard 200.


	The John Landis–directed movie, The Blues Brothers, was also a hit in 1980. Following Belushi's death in 1982, Aykroyd regrouped the Blues Brothers with help from John Goodman for the 1998 movie, Blues Brothers 2000, also directed by Landis. The last Blues Brothers live album, 1997's Blues Brothers and Friends: Live from Chicago's House of Blues, featured John's brother James Belushi alongside Aykroyd.

	It's not every day that Bruce Springsteen releases seven albums at the same time — 83 songs in all, going back over 40 years. But there's never been an archival project with the same crazed ambition of his new box, Tracks II: The Lost Albums. His 1998 Tracks was a crate-digging collection of vault gems that fans had spent years praying for — or hoarding on bootlegs. But Tracks II is a whole different ballgame: seven unreleased albums Springsteen made, trying out various genres and voices, spanning from 1983 to 2018. Each one of these albums is a moment in time; each one is a story on its own. But the whole damn thing is a treasure trove.


Tracks II is full of revelations because no artist has ever topped Springsteen's genius as an album-crafter — not just the songwriting, but the painstaking way he weaves these tunes into longform stories, piece by piece. Nobody's ever had his flair for album-openers — “Thunder Road,” “Nebraska,” “We Take Care of Our Own”— or closers —  “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” “I'll See You In My Dreams,” “Valentine's Day.” Nobody's got his ear for the subtle architectural details — “Hungry Heart” into “Out in the Street” is the ultimate “double whammy to kick off Side Two,” just as “Racing in the Street” is the ultimate “slow sad one at the end of Side One.” 

	











	So Tracks II is dazzling not just for the abundance of previously unheard songs, but for how he's built them into albums, including great ones like Inyo or Twilight Hour, or country and hip-hop experiments. Some of these records were seemingly finished and ready to go, except he decided to keep them on the shelf. Hell, every artist has “lost songs” — but what kind of madman has this many full-fledged Lost Albums? Only this guy.

	It's a lot of music to take in. For comparison, he's released nine albums in the past 25 years (two of them devoted to covers) so he's just doubled his 21st century output. He's got a sampler called Lost and Found, which has 20 superbly chosen highlights. But the point of Tracks II is engaging it on Springsteen's terms — as individual albums, each with its own place in his story.

	Most of this music comes from the Nineties, the weirdest phase of his career — his infamous wilderness years. He ditched the E Street Band and fled to L.A., of all places, to start over. But for the first and only time, he was struggling to make an emotional connection with listeners. Without his rhythm section, his E Street audience got split down the middle by grunge and country, as Bruce got outflanked by Garth Brooks on the right and Eddie Vedder on the left. “I just felt kind of ‘Bruced out,'” he told Rolling Stone in a bombshell 1992 interview. “I was like, ‘Whoa. Enough of that.'” 


	Most rock stars of his generation had their lost decade in the Eighties, floundering through the era of shoulder pads, MTV, and video-game album covers, then got their mojo back in the Nineties. But leave it to Bruce to do it the other way around — in the Spandex Decade, he had one of the hottest hot streaks any artist's ever enjoyed. His Eighties run was so packed with highlights, the world is still catching up. If we get a whole Hollywood movie about Nebraska, does this mean we can also get movies about Tunnel of Love, the making of the “I'm On Fire” video, or the day Bruce and Little Steven got thrown out of Disneyland by security goons because Steve refused to take off his babushka? 


	But for reasons nobody understood at the time, he entered his Bruced Out era, missing out on the Nineties rock boom. He released three albums, yet none clicked. As we know now, he kept making music, but in the outside world, it looked like he was semi-retired. He even said living in New Jersey was “like Santa Claus at the North Pole,” and he knew exactly how inflammatory those words would be — it was his Plastic Ono Band “I don't believe in Jersey” moment. A rough time to be a fan, but he came back stronger than ever with his 1999 E Street Band reunion tour and The Rising; the man hasn't come close to a dud album since. So what happened in between?

	That's one of the main reasons Tracks II exists — he wants to tell the story of his missing years. “I often read about myself in the Nineties as having some lost period or something,” he said in his album announcement. “Not really. Really, I was working the whole time.” Five of these seven Lost Albums chronicle that decade — he's really out to bury the image of the Nineties as the era of the Boss on the sidelines in a cast.

	











	The earliest is L.A. Garage Sessions '83, in the aftermath of his bold folkie detour Nebraska. “I was still a little gun-shy of fame,” he admits in the notes. “I was unsure whether to immediately release Born in the U.S.A. after Nebraska.” Despite the title, there's no Nuggets-style garage band—it's the opposite, a man in retreat from his group, making solo demos in his home studio with an engineer. It's full of close-up character studies in the mode of Nebraska (“Jim Dear” and “Richfield Whistle,” both close to “Highway Patrolman”) or Born in the U.S.A. (the heartland angst of “Sugarland” and “Don't Back Down on Our Love”). It feels like a bridge between these two blood-brother albums, the Sergeant Joe and Frankie of his catalog.


	“Shut Out the Light,” one of the toughest songs of his life, was the B-side of the “Born in the U.S.A.” single, but this version has a lost extra verse about the Vietnam vet's drug addiction. “Follow That Dream” is an Elvis tribute (named after one of the King's flat-out worst movies), a longtime concert fave that finally gets a studio version here.


	But this was the Eighties, when Springsteen had the golden touch. It's the Nineties where he lost his footing, and that's where Tracks II gets wild and fascinating. Streets of Philadelphia Sessions is a light genre exercise, devoted to drum loops and electronics, inspired by West Coast hip-hop. The very mid-Nineties sound is Springsteen exploring new beats, like most of his peers; this was the era of Paul McCartney's techno project The Fireman, Bowie's drum-and-bass album, and the Stones sampling Biz Markie. (It was practically illegal for a veteran rocker NOT to make a loops album.) But it's got songwriting strokes like the poignant “One Beautiful Morning” and “The Farewell Party.”


	The biggest find on Tracks II is Inyo, a portrait of the California badlands, set in border towns, desert roads, and aqueducts, with the heavy influence of mariachi bands. The songs were mostly written as he was driving near Yosemite or Death Valley, in the late Nineties. Inyo has musical connections with Tom Joad and Devils and Dust, yet it hits even deeper than either. The high points are when he goes full mariachi, for sentimental yet powerfully elegiac laments like “Adelita,” “The Lost Charro,” and “The Aztec Dance,” where the spirits of Montezuma and Cuauhtémoc seem to appear in the shadow of a strip-mall Pizza Hut.

	











Somewhere North of Nashville is a country romp banged out “on a whim,” as he says, in the summer of 1995 — he cut it in the afternoons for kicks, while working on the much darker The Ghost of Tom Joad. It's an experiment that's oddly insular, considering how Springsteen was the most influential artist in country at the time, with Garth, Clint Black, Joe Diffie, and so many others doing Bruce-style rock to feed the heartland's gigantic Springsteen craving. (Just to pick the most obvious example, Billy Ray Cyrus became an overnight Nashville superstar with his faux-Boss smash “Achy Breaky Heart,” which was the same damn song as “Pink Cadillac.”) 


Twilight Hours is a brilliant companion album to Western Stars, written at the same time (mostly 2011), exploring the same L.A. orchestral pop theme, twisting the bittersweet chords of Jimmy Webb, Henry Mancini, or Burt Bacharach. “Sunday Love” is a lush portrait of romantic agony — hope Brian Wilson got to hear this at least once before the final curtain. If you love Western Stars — an acclaimed masterwork at the time, yet one that just keeps sounding better over the years — he leans even harder into his crooner moves, going for Frank Sinatra/Al Martino smoothness in torch ballads like “Dinner at Eight” and “Sunliner.” The cocktail-noir drama “High Sierra” is one of the box's absolute peaks—he's a Bogart or Mitchum on the run from a past he can never escape, with debts no honest man can pay. 


Faithless is a “spiritual Western,” his atmospheric soundtrack for a Hollywood movie that never happened. Perfect World is the one cheat here — it's just a collection of stray songs, not an album he ever envisioned as a unit. But it's the right place to park loosies like “If I Could Only Be Your Lover” — a soulful lament too worldly to fit with the ghost stories on Wrecking Ball — or the mid-Nineties bangers “Rain in the River” and “I'm Not Sleeping.” “It's the only piece here not originally conceived as its own record,” he says of Perfect World. “I wanted just a little fun, noise, and rock & roll to finish the package.”

Tracks II is overpowering in its sheer abundance — you can spend entire weeks exploring these albums. It's loaded with songs that any other artists would have jumped at the chance to release—but not this guy, because good as they were, they just didn't fit into his overarching plan of the lifelong story he wanted to tell.

	











	That's why Tracks II ends up being a tribute to Bruce Springsteen's stubborn streak, which has been on fine display all year. If you've been following him lately, you know he's great at making himself a pain in the ass when he chooses, and right now he chooses — he's one of the most reliably ornery voices speaking out about this moment in American history, just as he was in the damn Eighties when Reagan tried to embrace him. It shouldn't have been his job then, just as it shouldn't be now, but he's out there doing it. (Bruce has always had flawless taste in enemies.) Only an artist with that kind of obstinate integrity could have assembled seven albums this great, but decided not to release any of them. For any fan, it's a revelation to hear the secret mischief that Bruce Springsteen was making in the shadows, during his most low-profile era — the music he made for himself, after years of making music for the world.

Amy Poehler knows that certain “Saturday Night Live” sketches during her time on the series haven't aged well. 

An “SNL” cast member from 2001 to 2008, Poehler portrayed public figures such as Japanese artist Yoko Ono and former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il during her time at Studio 8H. Now, Poehler has reflected on what she learned from potentially problematic sketches.

Poehler said during her “Good Hang” podcast in the below video that “getting older and being in comedy is you have to, like, figure out, ‘Oh, it's like everything has an expiration date.'” 

 










Poehler returned earlier this year to NBC's “SNL” stage for the 50th anniversary event, which included an “In Memoriam” segment for such sketches. “There was even on the 50th, when they had that segment which was like, ‘Here's all the ways we got things wrong,' and they showed way inappropriate casting for people,” she said. “We all played people that we should not have played. I misappropriated, I appropriated…I didn't know.”

Poehler added, “It's very real, and the best thing you can do is make repairs, learn from your mistakes, do better. It's all you can do.”

During the 50th anniversary show, Tom Hanks introduced the “In Memoriam” segment, saying, “Even though these characters, accents, and let's just call them ethnic wigs were unquestionably in poor taste, you all laughed at them. So if anyone should be canceled, shouldn't it be you, the audience?” 

Poehler previously recalled being part of the star-studded “SNL50” special. “It was a night of famous alumni and people,” Poehler said on the “Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend” podcast. “There were so many people that people had to share dressing rooms, so I was sharing my dressing room with Meryl Streep. Just like a fan, I was taking a picture of the door that said my name and ‘Meryl Streep,' and it was really cool.”

Poehler added “[Meryl Streep] was getting ready for her sketch and really rehearsing it, and I remember thinking, ‘I have never rehearsed as hard as Meryl Streep is in this one moment.'”

Despite attempts from both Blake Lively and Taylor Swift's teams, the singer hasn't dodged the It Ends With Us case entirely. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman ruled that texts between pals Swift and Lively, at least any that specifically pertained to the movie and its behind-the-scenes drama, should be turned over to Justin Baldoni's legal team. Lively's side has repeatedly accused Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios partners of shameless PR when it comes to dragging Swift into the muck. But, as Judge Liman wrote (via Variety), “A motion or request may be, and in this case often has been, both a legitimate litigation tactic and an attempt to maneuver in the broader court of public opinion.”

And so: “Given that Lively has represented that Swift had knowledge of complaints or discussions about the working environment on the film, among other issues, the requests for messages with Swift regarding the film and this action are reasonably tailored to discover information that would prove or disprove Lively's harassment and retaliation claims,” the judge wrote in his ruling. 

Swift's name has been bandied about frequently in the case, as Baldoni alleged that the Grammy winner was present during one meeting he had with Lively and Ryan Reynolds about the movie (he represented this meeting as a way for Lively to intimidate him into making the film her way). Baldoni's team tried to subpoena Swift, but dropped the idea after pushback from Swift, Lively, and the court; his lawyer had also alleged that Lively was extorting Swift for public support in the case (which she has not offered). The extortion claims were struck from the record and Baldoni's team was admonished for trying to stir up public scandal. 

Notoriously private, Swift's supposed unhappiness about being shoehorned into the drama has allegedly damaged her longterm friendship with Blake Lively, if the tabloids are to be believed. According to Variety, the texts will be under protective order to prevent them from leaking to the press. ​​“Baldoni's desire to drag Taylor Swift into this has been constant dating back to August 2024 … a strategy to influence the ‘TS fanbase,'” a spokesperson for Lively told NBC News in the wake of the judge's latest text message ruling. “We will continue to call out Baldoni's relentless efforts to exploit Ms Swift's popularity, which from day one has been nothing more than a distraction from the serious sexual harassment and retaliation accusations he and the Wayfarer parties are facing.”

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


	For the second time this year, the BBC has dropped a documentary film about the Israel-Hamas conflict, announcing that it will no longer move forward with Gaza: Doctors Under Attack.


	The BBC greenlit Doctors Under Attack last year from Basement Films, the production company run by former Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear. 


	It was meant to spotlight the plight of medics in Gaza, but production was paused in April following the scandal over Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone, the HOYO Films doc that was found to have been narrated by the child of a Hamas minister.

	A BBC investigation into How to Survive a Warzone remains ongoing. Peter Johnston, the BBC's director of editorial complaints and reviews, is examining the failings that led to the film being broadcast.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Now, the BBC has said it will not screen Doctors Under Attack, or carry any of its contents in news bulletins, after discussions with Basement “reached the end of the road” on Thursday.


	In a lengthy statement, the BBC said: “We have come to the conclusion that broadcasting this material risked creating a perception of partiality that would not meet the high standards that the public rightly expect of the BBC. 


	“Impartiality is a core principle of BBC News. It is one of the reasons that we are the world's most trusted broadcaster. Therefore, we are transferring ownership of the film material to Basement Films.”


	The corporation continued: “We want to thank the doctors and contributors and we are sorry we could not tell their stories. The BBC will continue to cover events in Gaza impartially.”

	











	In a statement, Basement Films claimed that the BBC had approved the film for broadcast and it was considered a “vital piece of public service journalism.”


	“They gave us no less than 6 different release dates, and it was subjected to a long and repeated compliance process as well as scrupulous fact checking,” Basement said. “They then apologised and reversed their position and said that it would be subject to the recommendations of the Johnston report.”


	The company added: “We are relieved that the BBC will finally allow this film to be released.”

A post shared by Basement Films (@basementfilms2)


	It is not clear what brought the talks between the BBC and Basement to a head. De Pear did, however, personally criticize BBC director-general Tim Davie on a public platform at the Sheffield DocFest on Thursday. 


	He said Davie is “just a PR person,” who has meddled in editorial decisions and is leading an organization that is “failing” in its duty to report on the Gaza crisis properly.


	“Something needs to happen because they are making decisions from a PR defensive point of view rather than a journalistic one. If you make a decision on a journalistic basis you can defend it, but if you make it on a PR basis, you can't,” de Pear said, per a report in Broadcast.


	The BBC said it spent weeks with de Pear attempting to get Gaza doctors' voices heard. “Our aim was to find a way to air some of the material in our news programmes, in line with our impartiality standards, before the review [into How to Survive a Warzone] was published,” it said.


	The BBC added: “Contrary to some reports, since we paused production of Gaza: Doctors Under Attack in April, it has not undergone the BBC's final pre-broadcast sign-off processes.”


	The BBC's coverage of the Gaza crisis has stoked strong feelings on both sides of the conflict, with How to Survive a Warzone illustrating the fraught nature of the debate. 


	The UK's Jewish community was appalled that the BBC screened a film narrated by a boy with Hamas connections that were not declared to viewers. Others argued that the BBC's decision to pull How To Survive a Warzone was an act of “censorship” that played into Israel's agenda.

In 2025, as Carrie Underwood returned to “American Idol” as a judge on the show she won 20 years earlier, producers pulled out all the stops to reminisce about her original season, from airing throwback footage to putting Underwood behind the wheel of the Mustang she won in 2005. 

Underwood is now not only one of the biggest country stars in the world, but also a mom to two boys — 10-year-old Isaiah and six-year-old Jacob — she shares with husband Mike Fisher. 

Underwood told “Entertainment Tonight” in April that her boys had never watched the season of “American Idol” she competed on. But in 2025, they were very invested in watching the first season she judged, she told attendees at the official Carrie Underwood Fan Club Party held at the Grand Ole Opry in early June 2025. And that, she admitted, led to a bit of friction at home when some of their favorites were sent home.

In a Q&A hosted by Cody Alan at Underwood's annual fan club party, currently airing on SiriusXM's Carrie's Country channel, Underwood said her sons were so into watching season 23 of “American Idol,” they were among the millions who cast votes — and they didn't quite understand that she couldn't always save contestants once viewers started voting. 

Underwood recalled, “My kids were, like, voting, and I'd come home and they'd be like, ‘Oh my gosh, they went home, we need to talk!' (I'd say) ‘I don't have anything to do with it! But I'm trying to tell (the singers) things that can help them stay!' So, yeah, it was just, it was a whole dynamic.” 

Even Underwood admitted she found herself getting upset week after week as different people were sent home, given that there was “so much talent” among the contestants. 

“Every single week that anybody went home, it's like, I was upset,” she told Alan. “Then I'm like, ‘Well, who else would it be?' I think I would be the same level of upset at everybody (going home).”

Before Underwood started her role as a judge with auditions in New York, she told E! News in October that her kids didn't understand what her new role meant. 

“My son this morning — he thinks I'm singing somewhere,” Underwood said. “So, he's like, ‘God, please give her all the right words and help her sing great.' And Mike was like, ‘She's not singing.' And then he was like, ‘OK, give her wisdom.' He has no clue, which I kind of love. They don't really know what I do. They do, but they don't, which I love. I'm mom to them, but I think they're going to understand when they start seeing episodes.”

Juggling life as a country superstar, “American Idol” judge, and engaged mom is a “balancing act,” Underwood told the crowd gathered at the Grand Ole Opry.  

“When you have a career and you are trying to mix that with having a family, it's like, you figure it out,” she said matter-of-factly. “And that's that's the same for all of us with kids and jobs in life.” 

“It definitely makes you prioritize what's really important,” she continued. “Like, I've said no to a lot of things that it's like I kind of wanted to do. But, you know, it's like, ‘Isaiah has a basketball game,' so I'm like, ‘I want to go this basketball game.' So it forces you to prioritize.”

Sitting on the Grand Ole Opry stage with Alan, Underwood said she feels like parenthood “makes you a better person. You kind of cut out some of the things that aren't necessary.” 

The “Jesus Take The Wheel” singer said being a mom also makes her connect with her own music even more than she used to, noting, “Musically, you know, it's a lot. You can be more emotional. You can go in to write (songs), and you can, you know, talk about your kids, talk about your life, talk about your friends, and kind of insert more of yourself into those kinds of songs and relate more to those kinds of songs when that's the life you're living.”

One of the most successful alumni of “The Voice,” season three winner Cassadee Pope, continues to shine 13 years after her victory on Blake Shelton's team. On June 18, 2025, Pope announced her latest career milestone, starring in the off-Broadway play “Rolling Thunder: A Rock Journey.” 

It's welcome good news for Pope, who's been co-starring in the final New York run of “Titanique,” but the show is closing after three years on June 29. Meanwhile, she weeks earlier that she was mourning the loss of beloved talent agent Dave Shapiro, who tragically died in a plane crash at 42, per the Seattle Times. 

Celebrating the good news of her new show, Pope, 35, shared on social media, “Been itching to tell you that I'll playing a sweet, Midwestern gal named Linda in the amazing @rollingthunderus which starts previews July 10th at @newworldstages . Guess I'm here to stay, NYC 🥰” 

A post shared by Cassadee Pope (@cassadeepope)

The musical “Rolling Thunder” was originally developed in Australia, according to Playbill, which called it “part rock concert, part documentary” as the cast “tells the heartfelt stories of young soldiers caught in the Vietnam War and the galvanizing protest movement that sought to end it.”

Pope plays the role of Linda, while the rest of the cast includes Drew Becker as Johnny, Justin Matthew Sargent as Thomas, Daniel Yearwood as Andy, Courtnee Carter as Lauren, and Deon'te Goodman as Mike. The show will have preview performances starting on July 10 before making its U.S. premiere at New World Stages on July 24, per Playbill. 

The outlet said “Rolling Thunder” features over 20 classic rock selections including “A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,” “All Along the Watchtower,” “Born to be Wild,” “People Get Ready,” “The Letter,” “Black Magic Woman,” “Gimme Shelter,” “Help Me Make it Through the Night,” “Eve of Destruction,” “Killing Me Softly with His Song,” “We've Gotta Get Out of This Place,” and “Bridge Over Troubled Water.”

Fans and friends flooded Pope's post with words of congratulations, including Broadway star Andrew Keenan-Bolger, who wrote, “That's my girl 👏👏👏”

Pope's good news comes on the heels of losing Shapiro, a widely-loved talent agent, in a private plane crash on May 22. Shapiro helped to launch Sound Talent Group in 2018, per Variety, representing rock groups including Sum 41, Eve 6, Pierce the Veil, and I Prevail. 

Tributes rolled in for Shapiro, including from Pope, who wrote on May 22, “The music industry lost a legend today. But more importantly we all lost a really special friend.” 

“I'll never forget the ways Dave Shapiro reinvigorated my belief in myself when I was at my lowest,” she continued. “When other booking agents made me feel unworthy of attention and care, he signed me, built me up and kept me busy. I owe a lot to this man. My love and deepest condolences go out to his family and loved ones. Such a sad day 💔”

Meet the Schnackys. With more than 30 million devout followers, a podcast, a Grammy-nominated album and much more, the first family of Christian content is asking their fans to bet on Him — and on them.


							By 

	Avery Stone



	Allie Schnacky understands you may not buy it when she says Jesus Christ is real. She'd feel the same if God hadn't transformed her life: if He hadn't planted dreams and visions in her mind; if those visions hadn't then come true; if He hadn't worked miracles for her and her family.


	She knows you might be skeptical. But before you turn away, heathen reader, allow her to explain.




	Or at least she wants to explain it to me. Allie is perched across the table from me on the porch at her family home, which is nestled along Lake Minnehaha in Clermont, Florida, a city 20 miles west of Orlando. Her bright blond hair is pulled into a slicked-back bun. Her maroon nails and gold Oura ring gleam in the dappled sunlight. “Ever since I was young, I've had such a fire for the Lord,” she says.

	Today is the first time I've met Allie, but it's not the first time I've heard her testimony. Until now, the 25-year-old has existed only in the palm of my hand, just as she does for her 4 million TikTok followers, 1.68 million YouTube subscribers and 875,000 Instagram followers. I've watched her lead virtual Bible studies from her favorite coffee shops; I've watched her preach as part of Chosen and Free, her Christian young women's ministry; I've watched her encourage women to find godly love like hers with fellow content creator Austin Armstrong, her childhood best friend turned first boyfriend of two years. I've watched her explain how to know if you're under spiritual attack, how her faith cures her anxiety, and how important it is to meet people, not just in the church, but “in the broken places they're at.”

	











	***


	On her own, Allie is a prominent faith-based influencer, part of a burgeoning sect of the creator economy. But she is also one piece of a larger and increasingly powerful family business: JWLKRS Worship, a collective of Christian content creators, musicians and speakers helmed by Allie's family, including her father, Lance; her younger sisters, Ella and Noelle; and her older brothers, Noah and Colby, the latter of whom was adopted by the family, and an evolving group of other creators, among them Armstrong, Mickala Williams, Tiffany Hope and Kristin Marino, Noah's fiancée. Together, the collective has a combined following of more than 30 million.


	But it's not just on social media that JWLKRS Worship (pronounced “J Walkers,” and you can guess who “J” is) and the Schnackys wield influence. On and offline, the family is a full-service entertainment firm for Jesus — the D'Amelios or even the Kardashians in a Christian alternate universe. They hold conferences attended by thousands. They host a podcast. They dominate on TikTok — including the app's livestreaming platform — as well as on YouTube and Instagram. In 2023, they began releasing music under the name JWLKRS Worship, and this year they attended the Grammys as first-time nominees for best contemporary Christian music performance/song. Last fall, in support of the popular worship brand Maverick City, they embarked on a 24-date arena tour that included stops at Barclays Center in Brooklyn and Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. They're now developing a reality show with L.A.-based production-management firm Propagate Content. And they live in three neighboring houses in the same gated community in Clermont, where Allie and I sit now.

	











	“God has changed my life,” Allie continues, across from me. Her face lights up, and her brown eyes widen. Her leather-bound Bible sits on the table between us. “I want to share it to the ends of the earth.”


	***


	JWLKRS Worship took off, as things did for many content creators, during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, the Schnackys had hunkered down to quarantine together at home in Clermont. It was Noah and Colby who doubled down on TikTok first. In the beginning, their content didn't focus on faith — it was mostly pranks and glimpses of their daily life. “They just started making videos for fun because there was nothing else to do,” Allie says.


	At the time, she was at a crossroads. She'd graduated from her public high school and was considering her next steps but had no interest in pursuing a career in social media. Instead, she thought of it as a dark place, where one's worth was determined by one's follower count. “[Social media] led me to spiral in so many different ways,” she says. “My brother was heavily involved in it, and people would always compare me to him even though he was my biggest supporter — as if my value was lesser than his because of a number on a screen.”


	Indeed, it was Noah who had the running start. The eldest Schnacky sibling began his entertainment career as a child actor and singer who built a modest following long before his time with JWLKRS Worship. As a preteen, he signed with the now-defunct A3 Artists Agency, began homeschooling and relocated to L.A. with Lance; his siblings and their mother, Kim, who worked as a pharmacist, stayed in Florida. (Noah and Lance made a fitting father-son team; Lance caught the entertainment bug early, too. After spending his childhood in Minnesota, his family relocated to Orlando. His mom — Noah's grandmother — got him started in acting in seventh grade, and as a high schooler, he watched Universal Studios being built. He applied for a job and worked at the park's grand opening. “Anything to be a part of it,” he told me over the phone.)

	











	Over the years, Noah landed a slew of minor small-screen roles, one on an episode of How I Met Your Mother, but his breakthrough came in 2018 when he independently released “Hello Beautiful,” a country-pop single that went viral; its success led to a Teen Choice Awards nomination that year, followed by a 2019 record deal with Nashville's Big Machine Records, the country label best known for signing Taylor Swift as a teenager. (Noah left Big Machine in 2022 but plans to release solo music under Recapture Records, the family's label that also issues JWLKRS Worship's music.)


	But it wouldn't take long for Allie to follow in her brother's footsteps. During the early days of the pandemic, God intervened at a particularly low moment. “I was in my bed, crying, just feeling worthless,” she says. “I felt so lonely … and He hit me so hard in my bed that night. He told me, ‘Allie, you are chosen by me.' She says the moment freed her from her fear of rejection. “I was able to share with others that they were known by God, as fully worthy.”


	And so, emboldened, Allie and her best friend from high school, Carol Wilber, joined their brothers and began livestreaming on TikTok, too. Soon, about 2,000 people joined to watch the group for hours each night. “We'd encourage them in their faith, to find peace and joy in that hard time [through] God,” she says, “because that's where we got it from.


	“We started to realize there was such a big need for people to be encouraged,” she adds, “for people to feel like they belong to a family.” And so the JWLKRS Worship collective was born.

	











	Its core members — including the Schnacky siblings and Armstrong — had met nearly a decade earlier at church. In 2015, they founded an affiliated youth group, also called JWLKRS. Content creation was simply a natural evolution. But once they began collaborating, their followings exploded.


	The family stepped into the spotlight at the right time. The past five years have ushered in a new generation of massively popular faith-based entertainment ventures, including 2025's House of David, a biblical scripted series on Prime Video that was watched by 22 million people worldwide in the 17 days after its premiere, according to Amazon. There are also films including Sound of Freedom; with more than $250 million at the global box office, it was one of 2023's biggest theatrical success stories.


	Other content creators have risen to meet the moment, too. There's Sadie Robertson Huff, a podcast host and castmember of the A&E reality show Duck Dynasty; the actresses Angela Halili and Arielle Reitsma, who co-host the top-ranked faith podcast Girls Gone Bible; the hip-hop and spoken-word artist Jackie Hill Perry, who also wrote a memoir about renouncing homosexuality after converting to Christianity; Reece Weaver, a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader who uses her platform — which was bolstered by a prominent appearance in America's Sweethearts, Greg Whiteley's Netflix docuseries about the squad — to discuss her Christian faith; and Jeanine Amapola Ward, an author and podcast host who serves up traditional lifestyle content with a glossy New Testament twist.

	











	There's also Madison Prewett Troutt, a Christian author, podcast host and onetime finalist on The Bachelor. Prewett Troutt and her family, in particular, have parallels with the Schnackys; in 2023, her mother, Tonya Prewett, co-founded UniteUS, an organization that brings large worship music shows to American college campuses and baptizes hundreds of students on-site. (After praying about it, Prewett Troutt declined through her assistant to be interviewed for this story.)


	Still, the Schnacky family and JWLKRS Worship loom large because of the scale and scope of their business. Each member's faith may be personal, but as a unit, they make a clear and savvy play for universal influence. That play also happens to come at a pivotal time in American politics and culture, in which Christianity has landed, with ever firmer footing, in the mainstream.


	***


	Lance Schnacky, the paterfamilias, doesn't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican, he tells me.


	It is my second day in Clermont. The Schnackys have just wrapped recording the first episode of a new season of The JWLKRS Podcast, slated to launch in August. After the recording, I sit down with Lance for the first time. The king of the Schnacky clan is a youthful 51, with an athletic build and taut, tanned skin. He wears a slim-fitting cobalt blue T-shirt, ripped jeans and a pair of white Nike Jordans. I've asked him about the group's merch, which includes a black snapback hat emblazoned with a nod to President Trump: the words “MAKE AMERICA GODLY AGAIN” in white block letters. When I inquire about the slogan, he waves Noah over, telling me it was his son's idea: “[Noah] likes to throw a little controversy in,” Lance quips.

	











	Noah pops in the doorway to the dining room, where we sit. The eldest Schnacky sibling wears a beige New York Yankees beanie, a sage green Fear of God Essentials hoodie and a slightly impish grin as if he knows a secret you don't. “We don't put our faith in any man,” he says. “What we're trying to do is get away from the left versus right. It's up,” he adds, referring to God, as he leaves the room. “It's always been up.”


	“I hate labels,” Lance adds, widening his eyes and shaking his head. “A lot of people come up to us [when we're wearing the hats]. They'll be like, ‘Oh, I love that hat.' Or they just look at you. You don't know if they want to kill you or what.”


	But has Trump's re-election in November altered the group's perspective or strategy at all? For Lance, the answer is no. “I don't put my confidence in who's in the White House,” he says. “There's a bigger story than our little world's, and it's God's story … all that other stuff is noise.”


	But the family itself makes a lot of worldly noise. The Schnackys' business empire is varied and slightly nebulous. JWLKRS Worship is a nonprofit, but each of its creators earns income from their work across various social media platforms. In addition to Recapture Records, there's Recapture Management and Recapture Livestream, the family's TikTok Live agency for faith-based creators, all of which are for-profit businesses. Then there are additional entrepreneurial offshoots, including a partnership with an Israeli tourism company and plans to develop a sketch comedy series based in Nashville. Other income comes from investments. “As for revenue, we usually keep that private,” Lance says. “We see money as a tool to steward, not something to chase. Whatever God puts in our hands — we try to use it faithfully and with purpose.”

	











	In the living room, the group breaks down the podcast's set. They put away ring lights and cameras and rearrange the pieces of a gray sectional to face the room's gargantuan flat-screen. They hoist a looming statue of an astronaut by the Filipino American artist known as Jefrë that served as a backdrop, returning it to its rightful place in the house's entryway. (The D'Amelio and Jonas families have similar Jefrë statues in their homes.) Allie crouches at her laptop, uploading the footage they've just captured. Noah and a few other creators are already livestreaming again.


	The combined effect is dizzying, similar to what living in TikTok's Hype House during its heyday must have been like, I imagine. Allie understands this comparison, making it herself the first time we speak over the phone. But for her, there's one big difference between other creator collectives and her family's. “There's no real relationship with a majority of these groups,” she says. “There's no history. There's no loyalty.


	“We've been together since we were young kids,” she continues. “But we don't live the same as everyone else. We don't drink. We don't party … people look at us and just don't understand it.”


	I ask Allie what she feels is the most misunderstood thing about her family.


	She pauses, then says, “People love to look at us and call us a cult.”


	***


	The Schnackys have acolytes, though — in their millions of followers and also in more than 5,000 faith-based TikTok Live creators signed to Recapture Livestream.

	











	I meet many of these other creators later that week when the family decamps to New York City for Recapture's Winter Games, a three-day live-streaming tournament for 225 of the agency's top creators at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square.


	The tournament centers on “battles” between creators. In each battle, several pairs go live on TikTok at the same time, asking for virtual tokens that viewers buy with U.S. dollars, which are then translated back into earnings for the streamer. (According to TikTok, in the U.S., most LIVE creators are eligible for a share of up to 53 percent of TikTok's net revenue from selling virtual items after deducting the required payments to app stores, payment processors and any other adjustments required under its terms and policies. According to Lance, Recapture Livestream does not take a cut of its creators' earnings, but TikTok compensates the agency directly for services it provides, including bringing “awareness” to the app's livestreaming function.)


	The games culminate in a final battle between the top two creators that will take place outdoors in Times Square and will be livestreamed on a 2,250-square-foot digital billboard. (When asked how much it cost to rent the billboard for a 15-minute slot, Lance declined to answer.)


	I arrive on Sunday, the day of the finals. On my seat in the Marriott conference room is a sheet of stickers from Upward, a Christian dating app and the event's sponsor, featuring such phrases as “Faith Over Fear,” “Prayer Warrior” and “Grow in Grace.” I watch Lance lead a morning worship service, which also includes a live acoustic performance from JWLKRS Worship, composed of Noah, Ella, Armstrong and Hope. The attendees — largely 20- or early 30-somethings from all over the U.S. and Canada — dance and sing along, eyes fixed on the Schnackys and their crew.

	











	Afterward, Allie is all business, filming content for Upward and interviewing a steady stream of creators about their experiences with Recapture and how it's changed their lives. Mattah Parker, a 25-year-old creator and model, steps into the frame and recounts how joining Recapture helped her pay off medical debt from multiple surgeries to remove benign tumors in her breasts, as well as her continued treatment for Type 1 diabetes, a diagnosis she received during the pandemic. “I'm a very holistic person,” Parker says, “And so to be told, ‘You have to go to the pharmacy every day and go see doctors — modern doctors.' That part freaked me out.”


	After filming, Allie shares with Parker how God has cured her own sicknesses. We stand in a circle as she prays over Parker, placing her hands on both of our shoulders, willing Him to cure her diabetes. “God, for her body, no medicine,” Allie says. “God, nothing but you and your spirit.”


	After the semifinals, Nathan Stroble and Cameron Carroll are the last surviving streamers. At 10:30 p.m., everyone heads outside into the cold. The two climb onto a platform at 46th and Broadway and begin battling. When their faces appear on the billboard, which towers above the Disney Store, the crowd erupts. Stroble begins to feverishly preach the Gospel; both creators shout into their smartphone cameras as viewers' gifts roll in. TikTok's live chat function, now projected dozens of feet high, floods with messages, including “Listen to God,” “Jesus loves you NYC!!” and “JESUS CHRIST IS KING.”

	











	Ultimately, it is Carroll who emerges victorious. He leaps into the crowd, which hoists him aloft. Noah follows, then others. The group breaks into the song “I Thank God,” which features JWLKRS Worship, jumping up and down. Passersby stop to watch as the Schnackys and their sea of creators scream the lyrics at the top of their lungs, in the very center of the universe.


	***


	In Clermont, the world goes quiet as the sun sets. Allie and I have just returned from a walk with Gatsby, the family's Bernedoodle. Back on the porch, Allie reflects on her journey; she can't quite believe the way it's played out so far, how fortunate she's been.


	“Even you being here,” she says. I assume she'll continue to explain what God has done in her life, but she pivots, telling me she prayed for me before I arrived. She looks out at the water, where she's told me a baby gator lives. “This isn't me trying to convert [you] or anything,” she continues. “I just genuinely feel like there's something He has for you in the way he's made you.”


	I ask her if she says this to everyone.


	“It's not like I meet somebody random and I'm like, ‘Oh yeah, God wants to know you,' ” she says. The twilight casts a dusty rose hue over her face, matching the color of the Bible she'll gift me before I leave. “But there was something different about you, in particular, from the first time I talked to you.”


	At one point, she reaches across the table to touch my forearm, bridging the gap between us for one fleeting moment. “I really believe you're here for a reason,” she says, resolute. “And that He's going to show you what that is.”

Season 16 of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” is currently airing on Bravo. Though “RHOA” season 16 brought a crop of new ladies to the cast, Phaedra Parks also made her return to the franchise. Now, the multi-hyphenated has confirmed that she will be back for the 17th season of the show. 

Recently, Phaedra Parks sat down for an interview with ExtraTV and discussed what fans can expect from the “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” reunion. However, she also briefly discussed her future with the series. 

The interviewer asked Phaedra if she'd be back next season. Phaedra answered, “You will definitely see me next season. You know, I was only on ten days working this season. So, I'm coming back ready to have some Housewives fun.” 

Phaedra saying she plans to return to “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” for season 17 is the first piece of casting news. Notably, there are still a handful of episodes for this season, as well as the reunion. 

“The Real Housewives of Atlanta” has undergone several cast changes over the years. Phaedra Parks joined the show during its third season and created several notable moments until her departure at the end of season 9. 

During her absence, Phaedra appeared on several other reality television shows. The list includes “The Traitors” season three and “Married to Medicine.” However, Deadline reported in July of 2024 that she would once again be a part of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta.” 

It's important to note that, as she mentioned, Phaedra returned to “RHOA” toward the end of season 16. As a result, she has only appeared in three episodes as of the time of writing. Most fans agree that, as a cast member, she's providing the comedic relief she's known for. 

Bravo confirmed on June 16th that the reunion for this season of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta would be filmed that day. They did so when they released the coveted seating chart. Phaedra Parks also discussed what fans of the show can expect from it in her recent interview with ExtraTV. 

Phaedra said, “There will be quite a few surprises and a lot of secrets revealed. It's definitely a ‘got ya' moment for a few of our housewives.” When asked how dramatic the “RHOA” season 16 reunion gets, she says it's “very dramatic.”

	Another week down, Insiders, and it was a hot one in Europe. We had journalists in France and Spain (at two separate events) to gather up the top stories from the continent, while in the UK, the zombies returned, angrier and scabbier than ever. Sign up to the newsletter here.


‘28 Years Later‘, A Threequel Arrives


Worth the wait: To me, it feels like just yesterday watching Cillian Murphy wander around empty London streets in hospital scrubs in 28 Days Later. It wasn't though – it was 23 years ago and I'm just showing my age. No doubt, however, that the love for Danny Boyle's zombie horror franchise has lasted all that time, as proven by the noise around the premiere of the third instalment, and the first since 2007's 28 Weeks Later. 28 Years Later had become the second-most watched horror trailer in history well before Boyle, writer Alex Garland and producer Andrew Macdonald debuted it in this week in London at a world premiere in Leicester Square – and all the signs are that it's cutting through. Our social media guru Nada and Breaking Baz were on the red carpet to hear from the likes of Boyle, Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Ralph Fiennes, along with Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment's Motion Picture Group, Tom Rothman, who tipped us that the film will make a star of 14-year-old lead Alfie Williams. The story is set nearly three decades after the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory and brought down society, in a film that our critic Damon Wise called a “particularly scathing” commentary about “Brexit Britain and its little-islander mentality.” Reviews have been pretty good, with some criticisms about the tone, pacing and ending, and its Fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes currently sits at 92%. You can go ever deeper by listening to Anthony D'Alessandro catch up with Boyle on our Crew Call podcast, where they discuss the long journey getting the film to screen and why the Slumdog Millionaire director won't be directing all three of the planned modern-day 28 trilogy. Anthony also noted Thursday in his box office round-up that 28 Years Later is tracking for a global start of around $56M.

Netflix The Aggregator











			Watch on Deadline		







“A new kind of partnership”: Big platform news this week came out of Cannes Lions, where Netflix and French commercial network TF1 announced a potentially market-altering partnership. In part borne out of the friendship between TF1 CEO Rodolphe Belmer and Netflix's top brass, the companies unveiled a “new kind of partnership” that sees five linear TF1 channels and 30,000 hours of on-demand content streaming on Netflix. To this point, Netflix has shown little interest in aggregating linear services – or any rival services, for that matter – but analysts have pointed out that the Netflix-TF1 relationship is a special case that has already seen them create Netflix's first daily soap in France. However, there's a sense this is the start of something bigger, as our analysis of the development showed. Truth is, global streamers need to attract older, linear-minded viewers and traditional players need the leverage and access to younger viewers of streaming services. ‘Diagonal integration and co-operation' is what the big brains over at Ampere Analysis are calling it. You heard it here first.


NHK At 100


Earthquakes and giant squid: Japan's NHK turned 100 this year and there has never been a better time to celebrate the role of public broadcasting. Good thing, then, that we landed an exclusive interview with President Nobuo Inaba, who detailed how the challenges facing pubcasters today may differ from a century ago, but the battles remain the same. In the 1920s, it was the Great Kantō earthquake that compelled the need for a public broadcaster, while today it has become the flood of disinformation driven by social media from which the public needs saving. Only public broadcasters can battle through the noise, Inaba argued, as he called for greater global collaboration and more shows for young people. Of course, public broadcasters enjoy nothing more than a celebration and a 100th birthday lends quite the excuse. In NHK's case, a series of special programs have been airing through the year, including a documentary titled Neo-Japonism and anime adaptation Cocoon. Pressed on his favorite NHK show of the century, Inaba went a bit curveball by opting not for critically-acclaimed drama or doc, but for a natural history series made with Discovery, which captured the world's first video images of a giant squid. Dive deeper.


Big Week For BBC


Phillips gets Moore responsibilities: The race to succeed Charlotte Moore at the BBC has ended – and the biggest job in British TV commissioning is staying in-house. A month after Deadline had revealed acting Chief Creative Officer Kate Phillips was the frontrunner, the BBC rubber-stamped the appointment, and into a new era we go. She called the job “one of the best roles in the business at an incredible organization,” and it's clear she's got a vision of where she wants to take the UK's biggest public broadcaster. With a background in unscripted, those in drama and comedy are understandably watching closely, but it's worth noting they did the same when the Left Bank Pictures-bound Moore became Director of Content in 2016, thanks to her past in documentary. Fair to say her tenure went more than okay. That's one big headache for BBC Director General Tim Davie fixed, but there's migraine of a problem over at BBC News, where a PwC consultant has been drafted in to steer an internal review into bullying and misconduct allegations on flagship show Breakfast, which Jake first revealed in this shocking report in April. Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

	











From CineEurope To Cuenca's Conecta


Slate of play: The U.S. studios had their game faces on and film slates at the ready at CineEurope in Barcelona, Spain, this week. The annual event drew its regular industry crowd, and Nancy Tartaglione was on the ground gathering up the biggest and best of the news. Lionsgate returned after sitting 2024 out, sprinkling some magic dust in the form of Now You See Me: Now You Don't and confirming Nancy and Matt Grobar's scoop that Glenn Close and Billy Porter have joined the cast of The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping. The studio was followed by Sony showing the first 28 minutes of 28 Years Later, Universal touting new Spielberg and Nolan projects, Warner Bros playing 30 minutes of July tentpole Superman, Paramount confirming Meet the Parents 4 and Disney teasing Toy Story 5 during a presentation that culminated in a James Cameron tribute to Jon Landau. Following the fun, Nancy and Anthony revealed the global box office is red hot, with Gower Street predicting a $12.4B summer. Over 300 miles away from Barcelona in the quiet city of Cuenca, I touched down for Conecta Fiction & Entertainment, the annual Spanish TV industry get-together. Nothing quite as splashy there, but reps from Max and Lupin maker Gaumont Television France gave their views on some live issues, as boiling hot temperatures gave way to biblical floods in the mountainous locale. Read the news from Cuenca here.

The singer previously described the final preview of Virgin as "an ode to city life and horniness tbh."

Lorde has dropped the “Hammer,” giving fans the final taste of her upcoming fourth album before its official arrival next week.


	With Virgin scheduled for release on June 27, Lorde took to social media earlier this week to reveal that one final single would be dropping in the lead-up – joining the recently-released cuts “What Was That” and “Man of the Year.”


	On Instagram Wednesday (June 18), Lorde explained that the new song would be titled “Hammer.” “First song on the album,” she wrote in her caption. “An ode to city life and horniness tbh.”

	Arriving on Friday (June 20), the euphoric new single features co-production by Lorde and Jim-E Stack, and launches with an electronic passage which has drawn similarities to Lady Gaga's “Poker Face” by some online commentators.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Lyrically, the track also references Lorde's previous comments surrounding the forthcoming recording, including that of rebirth, and also of her relationship toward gender – as evidenced in the line, “Some days I'm a woman, some days I'm a man.”


	The line echoes the singer's recent comments about fostering a close friendship with Chappell Roan in the past year, with the pair also discussing Lorde's changing relationship with gender. “[Chappell Roan] asked me this … She was like, ‘So, are you nonbinary now?'” Lorde recalled.


	“I was like, ‘I'm a woman except for the days when I'm a man,'” the singer continued. “I know that's not a very satisfying answer, but there's a part of me that is really resistant to boxing it up.”

	











	Gender is one of several topics Lorde has promised to explore on Virgin, which drops June 27 via Republic Records featuring additional production from Fabiana Palladino, Andrew Aged, Buddy Ross, Dan Nigro and Dev Hynes of Blood Orange. The singer-songwriter has also said that the album was informed by her experiences with disordered eating, quitting birth control and breaking off a longterm relationship.


	“THE COLOUR OF THE ALBUM IS CLEAR,” she described the project when announcing it back in April. “LIKE BATHWATER, WINDOWS, ICE, SPIT. FULL TRANSPARENCY. THE LANGUAGE IS PLAIN AND UNSENTIMENTAL. THE SOUNDS ARE THE SAME WHEREVER POSSIBLE. I WAS TRYING TO SEE MYSELF, ALL THE WAY THROUGH. I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A DOCUMENT THAT REFLECTED MY FEMININITY: RAW, PRIMAL, INNOCENT, ELEGANT, OPENHEARTED, SPIRITUAL, MASC.”


	The release of “Hammer' will also be accompanied by a Renell Medrano-directed music video, which will premiere via YouTube at 9am ET on Friday, June 20.

We finally get an episode filled with rich conflict, but at what cost? Season three of And Just Like That… immediately walked back the five-year gap Aidan (John Corbett) proposed at the end of season two, but everything still felt murky in terms of boundaries. This installment propels things forward at last only to have them ricochet back to where we started by the credits. I am tired.

Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) wakes up in Aidan's guest house because he and his sons are painting its exterior. Are these guys painting at the crack of dawn or does Carrie sleep until noon? Honestly, either is plausible. Because her luggage is still in the rental car, she's still wearing her outfit and five-inch heels from yesterday. Though she heads into town (by ATV!) to the “sister-wives dress shop” to buy a new wardrobe, she apparently does not think to get new shoes and either goes barefoot or clomps around in those monsters for the full episode.

The episode introduces us to Homer (Corbin Drew Ross), Aidan's delightful middle child, and Wyatt (Logan Souza), the problematic youngest who caused this mess to start with. We know from last season that he got drunk and crashed his dad's truck (at age 15), so we're aware that he has some struggles, but this episode brings to life exactly what that looks like. Some of it is typical teenager stuff—he's addicted to his screens, he's moody, he has a bad attitude about being asked to do stuff—but eventually we (and Carrie) realize that there is more going on here.

Aidan pushes them to bond, and Carrie does her best by agreeing to go to one of those virtual-reality zombie-fighting games at the mall. Unfortunately, Wyatt swings his pretend gun around and accidentally clocks Carrie in the head, which she proceeds to be a huge baby about. Carrie, you are trying to win this kid over! Be quick to say you're fine and you know it was an accident! But after decades of watching Carrie, I think we all know that she doesn't do well when she's not the center of attention—and Wyatt is definitely and understandably the biggest focus in Aidan's mind.

This all comes to a head at a family birthday party for Aidan's oldest, Tate (Jason Schmidt), that's also attended by his ex-wife, Kathy (Rosemarie DeWiit), and her boyfriend, Bob (Tony Crane). Bob tries to offer Carrie some advice on gaining acceptance with the fam: “It was hard for me to break in; they are a tight-knit group. But after four years down the road, it feels pretty normal.” Four years! And just when you think Carrie can't spiral anymore, Bob brings up the Adderall: Unbeknownst to Carrie, Kathy is pro but Aidan is anti. When she tries to raise this with him as he lights Tate's birthday candles, he snaps, “Carrie. Not tonight.” Timing was never our girl's strong suit.

The whole thing blows up, obviously, over a game of Apples To Apples. Wyatt starts to throw a fit because his cards aren't getting picked, the older brothers pile on a bit, and then he storms off before breaking a window with a shovel. Of course, Aidan and Kathy start going at it over the Adderall thing. She thinks Wyatt clearly needs it, but Aidan doesn't want to medicate a kid who is already showing substance-abuse issues. Carrie, a woman who can barely take care of herself, is out of her depth.

With this very intense family portrait, Carrie finally realizes what Aidan meant when he needed to be with his family. And honestly, I do too. There is a lot to work through here. And while a woman who isn't Carrie might find it in herself to be empathetic and helpful, that's just not Carrie's bag. She tells him she doesn't belong there yet. “Are you breaking up with me?” Aidan asks tearfully. “No!” she insists. No? No?! Then what is happening here? I am begging one of you to make it clear.

Balancing the episode out is a perfectly unhinged plotline for Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) Her BBC crush Joy (Dolly Wells) invites her back on air (why is she on the street like a correspondent instead of being interviewed like an expert?) and when she's trying to take Joy's advice to speak slowly, she stutters over the word “countryside.” Obviously, the internet does its thing an edits her into a meme saying “wild cunt.” Miranda is mortified and spends the whole episode stressing that Joy has lost interest in her, only to get a kiss at the end. 

We barely get any screen time with Lisa (Nicole Ari Parker) and Seema (Sarita Choudhury), but both are still navigating their career troubles from last week. Seema is starting her own real-estate firm but is bullied out of her office. Meanwhile, Lisa's stress over picking a new editor (she's going to hire a very hot Black man, but is worried that he's not a woman) has her sleep talking and Herbert (Chris Jackson) pursuing a sleep divorce. And finally, Charlotte (Kristen Davis) still has nothing to do. But in the scene where Harry (Evan Handler) can't get it up and she's comforting him that their marriage is more than their sex life, I wrote down: “Not relevant, but Charlotte's boobs look great.”

HGTV star Heather Rae El Moussa is keeping things real on social media, revealing how she feels the universe has been “testing” her. El Moussa cryptically spoke about some of her challenges as she steered her focus towards gratitude.

A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa)

On June 17, El Moussa took to Instagram Stories to share how she was feeling and, well … she revealed that things weren't going so great.

“Guys, I must say that I feel tested right now,” she shared. “Like this universe is testing me.”

She continued, “Um, there's a lot going on. I'm sure some of you know some things, you know.”

El Moussa shrugged, “It's okay.”

She noted, “There's a lot of good things, too. So I'm trying to work on my gratefulness, but it also doesn't help that I am PMSing bad this month.”

“But … breathe,” she said. “Right?”

She added, “Um, gratefulness … I'm grateful for a lot, especially this little love there,” she said as she pointed the camera at her son.

El Moussa noted, “And, yeah, [her beauty brand] Heather Rae Essentials is doing really well. So, good things. But yeah.”

She added, “It's a lot. Lots of trailing up right now, I must say.”

While “The Flip Off” star didn't reveal the exact reasons she was feeling tested, her husband, Tarek El Moussa, was recently involved in a fight in Las Vegas after defending his dad. He was cited for battery, but not arrested.

A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa)

On June 16, El Moussa shared exciting news that she can certainly add to her gratitude list. The HGTV star has partnered with SHEIN for her own home collection line of products.

She noted in an Instagram post, “So excited to finally share my favorite affordable home essentials in partnership with @shein_us!”

El Moussa continued, “These pieces bring beauty, comfort, and functionality to any space — without breaking the bank.”

She added, “Just search ‘HEATHER' on SHEIN to shop my #SHEINxHeatherRae must-haves.”

El Moussa curated the affordable line of mostly neutral-toned products, which includes kitchen items and home decor. In the video, she showed some of the pieces, including a tray, bar cart, salt and pepper shakers, a tea kettle, canisters, a spice rack, and table settings.

“I really hand-picked everything for you guys and I cannot wait to see them in your home,” she shared.

Home sweet home.

As Prime Video subscription holders wait for the fifth and final season of The Boys, sweet teases and behind-the-scenes details are being shared by the cast and crew. The raunchy superhero drama can be pretty unpredictable, but something that's definitely known about the new episodes is that there will be a Supernatural reunion. Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins are joining Jensen Ackles for Season 5, and Ackles just opened up about why the reunion felt like “being home.”

The Boys is created by Supernatural architect Eric Kripke, so the superhero-centric show has featured more than a few familiar faces from the long-.running CW series Ackles, for example, first appeared in the third season as Vought's first superhero, Soldier Boy. After it was revealed that he would indeed be back for Season 5, it was announced that Padalecki and Collins would be appearing in undisclosed roles. Kripke previously shared what it was like seeing the three reunite, and, while promoting his upcoming Prime show, Countdown, Ackles revealed to TooFab what it was like working with them again:

Like we never left. You know, Jared and Misha are brothers to me. We've spent countless hours together, not just on set, but off set. And so anytime we're in a room together, it's very easy and very comfortable. It's like being home. Anytime I get to mix it up with those guys, it's always a thrill.

Even though the trio frequently sees each other at conventions and appear to keep in touch in other ways, for them to actually work together again on set is something else entirely. Ackles and Padalecki starred on Supernatural for all 15 seasons, while Collins joined in the fourth season. And, since then, their friendship has grown into a brotherhood. Based on the comments above, it seems like not much has changed in the five years since their former show ended.

With the reunion also comes the opportunity to fix Supernatural's finale in a funny way. The drama's series finale was divisive among fans for a number of reasons but, with Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins coming together on The Boys, there's a possibility that Kripke could (spiritually) rectify all of that. Regardless of whether that happens, as a fan, I'm just excited to see the three actors to share the screen again.

Amazon Prime Video: 30-day free trialWith an Amazon Prime membership, you can stream The Boys, the upcoming Countdown and other great original titles. Customers get receive a free trial for 30-days and subsequently pay $14.99 a month. Or why not save 22% by paying $139 upfront for the whole year?

The Boys' final season is currently set to be released in 2026 and, unsurprisingly, a specific release date has yet to be announced at this point. Even though fans have to wait for more Soldier Boy, there's more content featuring Jensen Ackles on the way. Fans can keep occupied by watching Ackles' newest series, Countdown. The series, which also stars Eric Dane and Jessica Camacho, will premiere on June 25 on Prime Video, and Supernatural fans cannot get enough of Ackles.

I'm hopeful that the Supernatural reunion on The Boys will be worth the wait. Eric Kripke is a shrewd producer, and I'd imagine that he would bring Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins together without having a good reason. For now, know that all 15 seasons of The CW show are streamable with a Netflix subscription. And of course, do yourself a favor by preparing for the final season of the superhero show by watching the first four.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- This week on "Windy City Weekend," Val Warner was off, so Ryan Chiaverini was joined by ABC7 Chicago reporter Jasmine Minor.

In their "Host Chat" segment, they talked about a study which found that a simple sit-to-stand test can predict whether you'll die in the next 10 years. It involves standing to sitting cross-legged, and then standing again. You can't touch the floor with your hands, or your knees.

Chiaverini demonstrated it, and over 4,000 people aged 46 to 75 tried it, and the ones who could do it easily were six times less likely to die of heart and lung issues over the next decade.

They also talked about a BuzzFeed study looking at "harmless conspiracy theories" that people think might be true.

Chiaverini and Minor then welcomed two performers from the Goodman Theatre's reboot of the musical "The Color Purple" into the studio.

The performers, Brittney Mack "Celie," and Aeriel Williams, "Shug Avery," performed the song "What About Love."

Mack, a Chicago native, is well-known for her breakout role as Anne of Cleves in Broadway's "Six the Musical," a performance that earned her a Grammy nomination and a Drama Desk Award. Her portrayal of Celie is anticipated to be a deeply moving and authentic journey.

Williams is stepping into the iconic role of Shug Avery, the glamorous and free-spirited blues singer who becomes a pivotal figure in Celie's life. Williams brings her experience from "The Color Purple" National Tour, where she played "Squeak," and a host of other notable regional and Chicago credits, including "Memphis" and "Dreamgirls."

The production officially begins previews on Saturday, June 21, with opening night set for June 30. Audiences will have the opportunity to experience this powerful musical through July 27, 2025, at the Goodman's 856-seat Albert Theatre. Beyond the performances, the Goodman Theatre is offering a variety of complementary programming, including a "Color Purple Book Club" event on June 28, and a "Pride Night Out!" on June 27.

Tickets for "The Color Purple" are currently on sale and can be purchased through the Goodman Theatre's website, GoodmanTheatre.org/Purple, or by calling their box office at (312) 443-3800.

Chiaverini and Minor then introduced a taped segment about Darvin Furniture & Mattress.

Darvin Furniture & Mattress is offering big savings under the big tops and great deals throughout the store. We headed to Chicagoland's largest furniture store to check out their Tent Sale, offering savings of 60%, 70% and even up to 80% off.

After five years and countless customer inquiries, the Darvin Tent Sale returns to Orland Park from June 20-23. The Tent Sale is comprised of three tents and offers more than 13,500 square feet of space. Items include area rugs, recliners, sofas and sectionals, bedrooms, outdoor furniture and dining room sets.

When it comes to the best episodes of the TV show Supernatural, I trust the cast and crew to know which ones are memorable. However, I was surprised to learn that the general consensus for the series' most iconic installment wasn't the episode I had in mind. This isn't the scariest episode of Supernatural or the most emotionally devastating, but it does define the show and gives it a sense of purpose in the following seasons. However, this doesn't mean that I don't love and appreciate the episodes that the cast members have picked out as their favorites. 

Starring Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as Sam and Dean Winchester, brothers and monster hunters who travel across the U.S., Supernatural is one of the most important fantasy shows of the 21st century. Even in the best stand-alone episodes of Supernatural, the quality and nuance of the writing are apparent. While there are a few installments of the series that haven't stood the test of time, both of these episodes are just as fun to watch today as they were when they first aired. 

It's not surprising that the performers behind Supernatural look back on the season 6 episode, "The French Mistake," with plenty of adoration and nostalgia. Even as an audience member, it's obvious in every moment of the installment that the actors are having tons of fun and love getting to lean into unexpected parts of their characters. For the most part, the characters on Supernatural deal with outlandish and fantastical situations with the utmost seriousness, so it's nice to get a break from this. 

It's an incredibly meta episode, but Supernatural excels when it gets to delve into high-concept territory like this.

The episode follows Sam and Dean after they're transported to what appears to be our reality, where they're the actors Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles on the TV show Supernatural. It's an incredibly meta episode, but Supernatural excels when it gets to delve into high-concept territory like this. Additionally, the series gets to converse directly with the fanbase throughout the story. However, while "The French Mistake" is far from one of Supernatural's worst episodes, that doesn't mean there aren't some overlooked installments that better define the series. 

Though the Supernatural cast's favorite episode is "The French Mistake," the season 5 finale, "Swan Song," is unbelievable television. It might not break the show's formula or make you laugh, but that doesn't mean it isn't relentlessly engaging and memorable. "The French Mistake" is pure fun and entertainment, but there's always been more to the substance and tone of Supernatural than this. "Swan Song" still adheres to the self-aware style of the series, but it takes itself seriously, too. Without grounding episodes like this, Supernatural would be pure comedy, which it never intended to be.

 Of course, the season finale will always feel more exciting and carry more narrative weight, as it's the episode that the overarching storyline has been leading to. However, this isn't the only reason why "Swan Song" should be remembered and counted as such a pivotal installment. Padalecki gives one of his best performances of the series, giving his all to playing both Sam and Satan, which is never easy for any actor. However, each actor has their moment to shine throughout "Swan Song."

Of all the episodes of Supernatural that are worth revisiting, I'll never get tired of watching "Swan Song." The show changes a lot after season 5, and this episode works both as a seamless transition to this new era and a fitting goodbye to the first few years of Supernatural. The relationship and bond between Sam and Dean are at the forefront of "Swan Song," and episodes that uplift this dynamic will always be some of the best. Their connection as brothers anchors every season of Supernatural, and its strength is made clear in the episode. 

Additionally, "Swan Song" does a lot of work in terms of lore and world-building for Supernatural. This comes in handy in the later seasons when heaven and hell insert themselves into the Winchesters' lives even further. There are a few significant deaths throughout "Swan Song," but many of them are reversed, with beloved characters quickly returning in the following season. However, these resurrections don't lessen the impact of "Swan Song" or its events. In fact, it makes it even more satisfying to watch the episode unfold while knowing what the future holds.

Supernatural (2005–2020)

Looking at all the critically acclaimed and audience-acclaimed episodes of Supernatural, it's usually the funny, meta episodes that garner the most attention. There's no question that everyone loves it when a Trickster appears, and the Winchesters have to find a clever way out of a sticky situation, usually accompanied by more relaxed stakes and tension. However, "Swan Song" flipped the script on this. As a season finale and the end of the first era of Supernatural, "Swan Song" dug into serious territory to great effect. 

Supernatural is a TV show well known for following a procedural formula in many cases, but these episodes broke the mold in unforgettable ways.

Part of the fun of watching Supernatural is that the series has a sense of humor, but it's important to be reminded of how emotionally intense the stakes of the story are. The Winchesters are put through a lot throughout the series, and the events of "Swan Song" stay with them for years to come. Since it was initially intended to be the series finale, a lot of significant plot and character development is wrapped up in "Swan Song." Without episodes like this, Supernatural would never have become as iconic as it is today.

Rod Serling wrote various Twilight Zone episodes during the show's original run, and his best one shows why the series is a timeless masterpiece.

There have been three movies in the Rage Virus-driven "28 Days Later" franchise, all of which are good — but which one stands out as the best?

If Hulk had appeared in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Captain America: Brave New World, I think both he and Sam Wilson could have benefited.

NBC's "Blackout Thursday" was a huge deal back in 1994, but despite the likes of Friends and Mad About you taking part, Seinfeld famously refused.

The Rotten Tomatoes scores for 28 Years Later reveal that critics and audiences may not actually be on the same page, given the shocking divide.

You'd think a detective discovering he's descended from ancient monster hunters would lean into the camp of it all, but Grimm took that premise and went completely dark with it. When it kicked off in 2011, the show was a fantasy procedural, but it quietly morphed into a complex, mythology-rich series that never stopped dishing out surprises. Sure, it gave us the creature-of-the-week format, but it also crafted a brooding supernatural underworld full of conspiracies, bloodlines, rebellions, and centuries-old vendettas. This all unfolds against the backdrop of Portland, Oregon.

At the center of it all is Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli), a homicide cop turned reluctant Grimm, whose lineage forces him to confront not just monsters, but his own sense of right and wrong. The deeper the show goes, the more blurred the line becomes between good and evil, human and Wesen, justice and vengeance. And as each season, Grimm further dove headfirst into its lore, drawing viewers into a world where fairy tales were real, and they bled. But it wasn't all bogeymen and Blutbaden, beneath it all, there was always a slow-burning story about identity, legacy, and the cost of power. For a show that snuck in under the radar, Grimm sure left a shadow long enough to shape the next era of the very specific dark magic TV that included shows like Supernatural and The Magicians.

 Forget monster hunters with leather pants and magical swords, Grimm gave us a homicide detective with a badge, a burden, and a major Wesen problem. This was long before Geralt of Rivia grunted his way through courtly politics or Harry Dresden slung spells while solving mysteries. Giuntoli's Nick Burkhardt was doing both and in a button-down shirt, no less. One of his earliest shockers came in Season 1, Episode 2, “Bears Will Be Bears,” when he's put on a missing persons case with a Goldilocks and the Three Bears twist of epic proportions. It seems straightforward enough till he realizes that Rocky, the guy he's looking for, is about to be ritually sacrificed by a family of Jagerbars Wesen reenacting a twisted coming-of-age ceremony in the woods. And he's supposed to arrest someone for this? Later, in Season 1, Episode 10, “Organ Grinder,” Nick and Hank (Russell Hornsby) investigate missing homeless teens, only to discover they're being harvested by Geiers for their organs. Needless to say, it's a lot for anyone to handle, even though he's seen some dark stuff on the streets.

But, it's not just the weekly monsters that wear Nick down, it's the fallout that follows. At some point, his double life starts bleeding into everything, and the people he loves get dragged into the vortex of chaos. Juliette (Elizabeth Tulloch) loses her memory after a Hexenbiest scratch, then spirals into a supernatural identity crisis. Hank nearly loses his mind after too many unexplained Wesen run-ins. And then there's Sergeant Wu (Reggie Lee), who gets bitten by a Skalengeck and ends up battling lycanthropia — a rage-fueled, were-creature-like condition that transforms him forever. At some point, being a Grimm wasn't just Nick's familial responsibility; it became the slow, contagious unraveling of everyone around him.

 If you were flipping through Grimm and landed on a Wesen mid-transformation, you'd probably stop, blink, and ask, “Wait… did that man just turn into a porcupine banker?” And the answer would be, yes, he did. In more ways than one, that's the magic of Grimm. Besides being monsters-of-the-week, the Wesen were deeply weird, weirdly deep, and packed with personality. Each species and each individual felt like someone took a page from a twisted fairy tale, ran it through a crime drama filter, and dropped it in Portland.

The Fuchsbau (fox-like), Blutbad (wolf-ish), and Skalengeck (lizardy creeps) weren't just spooky to look at; they all came with their own species history, alliances, and ancient beef. Take Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), he wasn't just a reformed Blutbad, he was also a watch repairman with a thing for classical music and vegan brunch. Even the terrifying Ziegevolk had day jobs and relationships, which made their transformations all the more jarring. That blend of creature and character was Grimm's true secret weapon.

The VFX and practical prosthetics work deserves an award retroactively. Remember the Hexenbiest transformations? Like watching a soap opera villain turn into a corpse in real time. Or the Löwen — basically lion-Wesen who ran underground fighting rings in Season 1, Episode 12, “Last Grimm Standing” — every snarl packed narrative weight. No show on network TV at the time was this committed to making monsters feel real. Meanwhile, Grimm didn't just show you the beast; it showed you the therapist bills and workplace tension that came with it.

"Trust your instincts and nothing else." 

You know how most monster-of-the-week shows start feeling like a Scooby-Doo rerun after five episodes? Grimm took the format, but served up a show where every creature mattered and even came with receipts. Instead of throwing in a new Wesen every Friday night, the show gave each one cultural roots, family trees, grudges, and increasingly heavy baggage. Take Season 1's “Organ Grinder” — a dark, gritty episode featuring Geiers (vulture-like Wesen) harvesting organs from homeless teens. That's not just creepy body horror; it offered up social commentary wrapped in claws and folklore. Or Season 2, Episode 9 “La Llorona,” which taps into a Latin American legend to deliver one of the show's most haunting standalones. In a nutshell, it's a story about loss, guilt, and supernatural grief that doesn't even involve a Wesen, yet still fits perfectly into the world.

It wasn't just the monster variety that was clever, it was how each case connected to a real-world issue or a core character's growth. The Wesen-of-the-week could easily be a metaphor for addiction, abandonment, prejudice, or even depression, and often, they were. At the end of it all, that made the show feel deeper, smarter — like a dark fairytale detective series with emotional teeth. Even when the cases didn't tie into the main arc, they still taught you something new about Wesen society — the laws, the rituals, the subtle politics. So, rather than just checking off episodes, Grimm was building a weird, wounded world one creature at a time and daring viewers to pay attention.

We need to talk about how you're using your powers, Clark...

This would be the rise to power that Elayne deserves.

This unexpected scene in the dystopian series' finale actually makes perfect sense. 

This ambitious series was cancelled too soon.

At this point, we're all well aware of what loss is.

EERIE new footage taken by the US military has captured a never-before-seen disc-shaped UFO mysteriously darting through the air.

Independent journalist Jeremy Corbell leaked the video and said he was stunned by the "implications" of the jaw-dropping sight.

He published the video on his social media on Tuesday, which captures the unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) soaring through the clouds.

Corbell said the clip has made history because of the object's shape. 

Most UFOs caught on camera have a sort of pill shape, but this one looks straight out of a science-fiction movie.

The video was taken by the military on November 23, 2020, and it was released after Corbell spent years verifying the footage with inside sources.

He said that US officials themselves admitted the UAP was a "disc" with an unknown origin. 

They said the craft "displayed abrupt movement and intelligent control" as it can be seen flying to the right before suddenly changing directions.

The UFO also noticeably doesn't give off any heat signatures or signs of thermal propulsion like a normal aircraft would.

Between the never-before-seen shape and the bizarre movement, Corbell said the sighting "has implications that are huge," he told the Daily Mail.

"This is the first time in history that military filmed footage of a disc-shaped UAP, designated as such by the military, has been captured on camera and released to the public," he said.

Corbell explained that it was "astonishing" that a UFO of that shape could nimbly dart through the air without emitting heat signatures.

"It's a perfect-looking disc, maybe it's an orb," he told NBC News.

The object is believed to be between 200 and 400 meters in diameter, but Corbell said that the size is debated.

It was captured flying around the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to coordinates seen in the corner of the video.

The military still considers the object a UAP and continues to investigate the sighting, according to Corbell.

The journalist claims that he's spoken with service members who had first-hand experience witnessing the footage.

He called for Congress to respond to the video and said that military whistleblowers are ready to testify and describe what they saw.

Corbell hopes that releasing this footage will encourage transparency from officials who witness UAPs.

"The source is legit. We know it's real," Corbell's cohost George Knapp said in their podcast Weaponized.

"It was not supposed to be made public. But it should've been."



Corbell previously told The Sun that UFOs have been kept a secret so that militaries can adapt their technology for warfare.

And he released disturbing details about a "huge alien aircraft" that was caught hovering over a US military base.

THE Tic Tac UFO is a mysterious flying object that U.S. pilots and experts have claimed to have witnessed over the last few decades.

The first famous sighting with footage took place off the San Diego coast in 2004, after pilots on the USS Nimitz carrier strike group detected the object.

Commander David Fravor believed it to be something beyond human technology - as it possessed extreme acceleration and no visible propulsion.

Then in 2015, pilots on the USS Roosevelt off the East Coast captured footage of unidentified moving objects.

They also showed no means of propulsion and moved at high speeds.

Speculation online has caused alien fanatics to look for more Tic Tac-shaped space paraphernalia, including a Russian military base which appeared to be a Tic Tac UFO "charging hub".

The Pentagon has also acknowledged other declassified videos of encounters, but have been unable to explain them.

A veteran US fighter pilot has broken his silence about a near-collision with a UFO that defied the laws of physics and left the Air Force in stunned disbelief.

Major Ryan Bodenheimer, a retired F-15 and F-16 combat pilot, revealed in a YouTube video that one of the 'wildest experiences' of his career involved a close encounter with a rectangle-shaped UFO as he flew with his squadron over southern Wyoming.

Bodenheimer, who served in the Air Force for 13 years, said the large craft suddenly appeared out of nowhere during a training mission and looked to be on a collision course with his plane.

'Then I realized we weren't going to hit, and all of a sudden it came more into view, and it was a rectangular shape. This was like essentially a perfect rectangle,' Bodenheimer revealed in his video on June 8.

The military veteran described the UFO as being 30 to 50 feet in height and appearing to be glowing around the edges of its bright white body as it flew alongside the Thunderbirds, the Air Force's elite aerobatic demonstration squadron.

Bodenheimer added that this craft had no visible vapor trail coming from an engine, no radar signal, and was traveling at approximately 400 knots (460 miles per hour).

'It really was defying any type of aeronautical laws that I've learned,' Bodenheimer said.

Bodenheimer then revealed that his report to air traffic control left officials in 'dead silence' before the entire matter was apparently dismissed as an 'anomalous object.'

The strange rectangle UFO got so close to Bodenheimer's F-16 Falcon at 30,000 feet in the air that he said he could make out every detail of the craft before it eventually flew off and was never seen again.

When air traffic controllers in Denver asked Bodenheimer if he could give them any more details about the UFO, he revealed that it had a cream-colored interior that became transparent or had a hole in its center.

'I know it sounds like I'm talking about a delicious pastry, but this was the wildest experience I've ever had,' the fighter pilot joked.

The only evidence of Bodenheimer's sighting was a report made by air traffic control saying that an object had been spotted in the area where the Thunderbirds were training that day, but he never heard from anyone about the incident again.

The former combat officer explained on his channel, Max Afterburner, that this UFO could not have been a weather balloon, a high-tech drone, or some kind of light trick.

'There was nothing that made me think this was some sort of illusion. It was clear as day. It was right down our wing line, a 30 to 50 foot object,' the pilot continued.

Bodenheimer then speculated whether this could have been an extraterrestrial craft, noting that he's never been a fan of 'science fiction' but admitted that his encounter matched many of the incidents involving military pilots that 'defied physics.'

'Going against aerodynamics definitely blows my mind. Anti-gravity, something that cloaks radar, I didn't see anything on the radar,' he added.

The object wasn't even tilted to deflect the wind while traveling at that speed. It stayed completely vertical as if the wind did not affect the UFO's ability to fly at over 400 mph. 

This wasn't the only time the Air Force veteran had encountered a UFO. He added that 'lightning-fast triangle' while training with the Thunderbirds near Area 51 - the military's top secret base in Nevada.

'There's been lots of crazy stuff that's been reported out there,' Bodenheimer said.

On this day, the mysterious jet-like object flew past Bodenheimer's F-16 as his squadron was coming in for a landing.

'This lightning-fast triangle blitzed past me as we were setting ourselves up on a final [approach],' the pilot revealed.

'I just remember this thing going massively fast past me... It had basically done an interceptor maneuver, a dust-off. So maybe this was its way of having fun, saying maybe this should be Top Gun 3,' Bodenheimer detailed.

The pilot noted that he hopes coming forward will encourage more of his fellow pilots to reveal what they've seen during their time in the military, noting that there have been roughly 800 UFO reports in just the last four years.

The Pyramids of Giza in Egypt have remained an object of fascination for historians, archaeologists, and the public for centuries. The question of who built these monumental structures and how continues to cause debates. In recent years, the hypothesis about possible extraterrestrial involvement in their creation has again attracted attention thanks to new research and publications.

The Pyramids of Giza, including the Great Pyramid of Khufu, were built around 2600 BCE during the Old Kingdom period of Egypt. According to the generally accepted scientific version, they were constructed by thousands of workers using complex but available technologies of that time, such as levers, rollers, and inclined planes. However, the exact construction methods still raise questions, especially regarding the transportation and installation of multi-ton stone blocks.

In 2024, Dr. Amina Hassan, an Egyptian archaeologist from Cairo University, published a study in which she analyzed unusual geometric features of the pyramids. She noted that the orientation of the Great Pyramid to the cardinal directions with an accuracy of 0.05 degrees and the use of blocks weighing up to 80 tons in construction required knowledge that, according to some, exceeded the capabilities of ancient Egyptian civilization. Hassan does not directly claim extraterrestrial intervention but emphasizes the need for further research.

At the same time, the book "Cosmic Architects" by author James Crow, published in April 2025, has again raised a wave of interest in the alien theory. Crow refers to ancient texts, such as Sumerian tablets, and suggests that extraterrestrial civilizations may have transferred technologies to the Egyptians. He points to similarities in architectural styles between pyramids in Egypt and Mesoamerican cultures, separated by thousands of kilometers and centuries.

The archaeological community is mostly skeptical about hypotheses of the extraterrestrial origin of the pyramids. Professor Mark Lehner, a Giza expert from the University of Chicago, in an interview dated June 10, 2025, stated that archaeological findings, including workers' camps and tools, confirm the human origin of the pyramids. He emphasized that the alien theory often relies on the absence of evidence rather than its presence.

Modern technologies, such as lidar scanning and 3D modeling, have allowed scientists to better understand the construction process. For example, in 2023, an international team of archaeologists discovered the remains of an ancient canal near the Giza plateau, which was likely used for transporting materials.

Besides the extraterrestrial hypothesis, there are other explanations. Some researchers suggest that Egyptians might have used lost technologies or mathematical knowledge that have not yet been fully studied. Others point to possible influences from neighboring cultures, although there is little concrete evidence for this.

The question about the construction of the pyramids remains open for discussion. Despite the popularity of theories about extraterrestrial involvement, the scientific community continues to seek answers in archaeological data and technological reconstructions. New discoveries and technologies may shed light on this ancient mystery in the future, but for now, the Pyramids of Giza remain a testament to humanity's engineering genius.

I wouldn't consider myself one of those kooky people who call late-night radio talk shows that focus on things like ghosts, aliens, and other "unnatural" topics. (although I do enjoy listening to those shows)

However, I'm also not one of those folks who refuse to believe that we're all alone in this giant universe of ours.

While I'm not sure that I've ever seen an actual "UFO", I do believe they exist, and I don't think they're filled with "little green people". It seems I'm not alone.

They call Montana "Big Sky Country", and that's for good reason. And according to one source, it seems there are a lot of Montanans out there seeing things other than stars in those big skies of ours.

The Action Network, which allows folks to place bets on sports and other activities, put together some research on U.S. States and UFO sightings. (Apparently, you can bet on anything, including the odds of seeing a UFO in Montana)

Oh, and UFO sightings aren't new in Montana; in fact, there have been a couple of famous sightings over the years, including one near Great Falls that allegedly shut down the nuclear missile silos for a short period.

So, what are the odds that you will see a UFO flying over the Treasure State?

According to the data, Montana ranks 2nd in the nation when it comes to the best places to see a UFO. Oh, and in case you're wondering who beat us out, that would be the state of Vermont.

The breakdown is as follows:

It should be noted that we're right on the heels of Vermont. I mean, I feel like if just a couple of more folks who might be afraid of ridicule would come forward, we could overtake that number one spot. I mean, we're talking about minimal effort here.

So, the question is, do you believe in UFOs, and have you ever seen one? Was it something you could explain? Was there anyone else who was there when you saw it? Let us know by sending us a message on our app.

Five months into his second presidency, Donald Trump continues to promote the repeatedly debunked conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was stolen from him. And Trump isn't alone in that regard: From MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell to FBI Director Kash Patel, many MAGA Republicans still refuse to believe that Trump was voted out of office in 2020. 

In an opinion column published on June 19, MSNBC's Steve Benen tears apart a "nonsensical" new 2020-related conspiracy theory that Patel is pushing. 

Patel, in a June 16 post on X, formerly Twitter, wrote, "The FBI has located documents which detail alarming allegations related to the 2020 U.S. election, including allegations of interference by the CCP. I have immediately declassified the material and turned the documents over to the Chairman Grassley for further review."

But according to Benen, the conspiracy theory Patel is promoting is divorced from reality.

"As part of the same tweet thread," Benen explains, "Patel referred the public to an article from John Solomon, another Trump ally, who reported on an unsubstantiated claim from an unidentified source about China producing driver's licenses to be used in a mail-in ballot scheme. Those inclined to take any of this seriously should probably think twice….. Rick Hasen, an election law expert…. told NBC News that while Patel's post 'might feed the MAGA base,' what he was promoting was an uncorroborated story of unknown origin 'with no evidence that anything actually happened, and certainly no evidence that any ballots were cast or illegal voters were even registered to vote using state identifications.'"

Benen adds that "conspiracy theorists on the right who hoped that this might finally confirm their baseless ideas should probably start lowering their expectations now."

"That said, this week's unfortunate developments were a timely reminder that Trump isn't the only one still embracing nonsensical ideas about his 2020 defeat nearly five years later," the MSNBC journalist writes. "The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who presumably has actual work to do, is swimming in the same misguided waters."

Benen's column and Patel's new conspiracy theory are generating a lot of discussion on X.

Podcast host Jack Hopkins, a former Republican, tweeted, "This isn't just absurd — it's criminal neglect. Patel and Trump are flinging a baseless conspiracy about China and 2020 without a shred of evidence...all to rewrite history and sow chaos. If this isn't betrayal...what is? The FBI deserves better than this circus. #FBI #Conspiracy."

Resist Hateful GOP Policies posted, "Trump, FBI's Patel run with a weird new 2020 election conspiracy theory. The conman isn't the only one pursuing baseless ideas about his 2020 defeat: His FBI director is unfortunately doing the same thing."

Self-described "southern liberal" Anne Adams commented, "Trump, FBI's Patel run with a weird new 2020 election conspiracy theory. I huge and complete lie."

X user Pamela Dubskoy wrote, "FBI Director Kash Patel feeds 2020 election conspiracy theories with documents about unverified…. More LIES from the Trump Administration."

LOVE Island fans are convinced Yasmin Pettet is an AI bot in a bizarre conspiracy theory - following a series of weird moments in the villa.

The claim gained traction on social media following last night's episode, when Yasmin, 24, appeared unusually rigid during the recoupling.

Viewers noted that she stood stiffly by the firepit, blinking slowly and barely reacting to the events unfolding around her.

Clips of Yasmin sitting bolt upright in her bikini during Wednesday night's installment have added fuel to the theory, with fans describing her as “glitching” and “robotic”.

One TikTok user posted a video of Yasmin with the caption: “She genuinely scares me,” while another joked, “Is Yasmin AI?” on X, formerly Twitter.

A third viewer wrote: “I saw someone say Yasmin is AI and bro she is literally not real.”

Someone else joked: "Yasmin is the certified first Love island AI icon," as a fifth chimed in with: "is yasmin love island's first ai contestant?"

One more asked: "Are we sure Yasmin is'nt AI robot?"



Show fans previously shared their convinction the commercial banking executive had been planted by producers, ranting, "she CANNOT be real!"

Due to her outrageous antics, fans are convinced Yasmin is a Love Island "mole" and has been put in the villa by producers to stir things up.

So far she has asked Dejon for a threesome, propositioned Harry, and talked no stop about sex - despite saying she had only slept with two men.

Taking to X, one wrote: "I am convinced Yasmin is a producer plant and was told to f**k s**t up. She cannot me real!"

Another added: "Yasmin has to be a producer plant because there is no way."

Someone else fumed: "You cannot convince me she isn't some sort of producer plant put in to stir the pot this season."

Fans have also branded Yasmin "the real villain" of the villa as they feel she is doing all she can to split up Meg and Dejon.

Yasmin has come under fire over her flirty interactions with Dejon, and also asking him for a "threesome".

Taking to X, one fan vented: "Yasmin is a villain she just doesn't give a f**k."

Another added: "Yasmin is actually a beg AND a weirdo omg what a villain."

Someone else fumed: "They hating Malisha when the real villain is Yasmin."

It all kicked off after Yasmin turned to Dejon on Tuesday night's episode, and asked: “I have a question for you, it's a bit rogue, would you have a threesome with me and Toni?”

Dejon laughed - but was soon saved from answering as Meg called out: “Come here please!"

He joked: "You called me at a good time! Oh my god! We'll continue that question."

However, the flirty tone continued as she followed up with: “It was in my head, I had to say it. Intrusive thoughts, intrusive thoughts."

Yasmin tried to defend the comment as innocent fun, insisting: “It was just flirty banter. I think all of us talk really openly about sex and what we want to experience.”

But Meg wasn't having it, firing back: “It just seems to be you three all the time.”

In the same episode, bombshell Yasmin revealed to some of the Islanders, including Harry and Dejon, that a man had never given her an orgasm before - which came amid another very shocking claim.

The Londoner also confessed that she has only ever slept with two men before, despite speaking about sex frequently with guys in the villa.



Then, in Wednesday night's instalment, Yasmin spoke to Harry on the terrace when things got very flirty.

She spoke about being "bent over" and he said she was "undressing" him with her eyes.

The Rise of Psychic Capitalism: Why People Are Turning to Intuitive Guidance

 20 Jun 2025 3:02 PM IST 

The decline of institutional trust has reshaped how people seek clarity.  

In a landscape defined by burnout, fractured attention, and unstable career paths, a different infrastructure is taking hold, not built on productivity or optimisation but on interpretation.  

Tarot readings, astrology, and psychic consultations, which once sat at the cultural margins, now serve a quiet but significant function: helping people process uncertainty.  

This shift has less to do with mysticism and more with interpretation.  

Without stable narratives, symbolic systems offer flexible tools for navigating ambiguity.  

These aren't beliefs. They're frameworks, ways of making emotional complexity visible and, in some cases, manageable.  

If you've ever opened multiple self‑help tabs only to feel more stuck, you're far from alone. Self‑improvement often sells transformation through structure: journals, therapy, habit trackers, and guided apps. But when your mind is overwhelmed, these tools can feel like extra noise.  

Intuitive services, on the other hand, offer something different.   

A tarot session doesn't give you a checklist. It gives you space. An astrological chart doesn't tell you what to fix. It helps you reflect on what's already there. These symbolic tools aren't clinical; they're conversational. They don't demand output; they invite introspection. And sometimes, that's precisely what we need.  

This trend isn't about abandoning reason. It's about balancing it. Instead of constantly asking, “What should I do next?” more people are learning to ask, “How do I feel right now?” That shift from strategy to self-reflection is decisive.  

Today's intuitive guides, or emotional facilitators, frame their services in practical, grounded terms. It's not about destiny; it's about discernment. Instead of promising life‑changing revelations, readers meet real human needs: navigating a career shift, unpacking a relationship, or clearing emotional fog.  

They're not handing you the answers. You're reclaiming your perspective.  

The most striking shift is online. Rather than following a single guru, users now connect with intuitive readers based on modality (tarot, astrology, energy healing), emotional tone, or relational focus.  

Many find their way to online spaces supporting this kind of emotional exploration. Platforms offering psychic reading services make it easier to connect with intuitive practitioners based on style, modality, or emotional tone, creating a more personalized and accessible experience.  

Why do people return to these services, even if they're not believers? Because symbolic interpretation works. A tarot spread can pinpoint the emotions you didn't know you were carrying. An astrological transit can explain why you've felt off-balance or disconnected.  

These modalities don't claim literal truth. They offer metaphors, which help us make meaning. They give emotional shape to what often feels intangible or unspoken. In a culture that usually expects quick fixes or polished answers, symbolism gives us space to explore without judgment, an open-ended form of gentle and profound insight.  

That kind of symbolic fluency often gets overlooked in conventional self-help. Where logic and efficiency dominate, intuitive practices offer a gentler language rooted in process, presence, and personal rhythm. A good tarot reading can feel like someone lighting a candle in a room you didn't realize was dark.  

There's also a quiet but essential transformation within the intuitive space: readers reframe their role. The best guides won't tell you what your future holds. Instead, they'll help you have your present with more clarity. You're not outsourcing decisions but reclaiming agency.  

Credible platforms include advisor profiles, user reviews, and transparent session expectations. This emphasis on clarity nudges users toward empowerment, not dependency.  

Of course, intuitive tools aren't a cure-all. Used carelessly, they can become a distraction. But used with intention, they create something rare: a ritual that slows the moment down and makes it meaningful.  

A ten‑minute reading won't solve your challenges but might help you see them differently. You don't need to believe in energy fields or planetary alignments to benefit. You only need a willingness to listen to yourself, your feelings, and your intuition.  

Ultimately, the rise of what's been dubbed “psychic capitalism” isn't evidence of a cultural obsession with mysticism. It reflects a deeper hunger for emotional rhythm and attunement. These tools offer stillness and inquiry in a world that prizes speed and certainty.  

Whether it's a quiet evening with a tarot deck or a guided session on a trusted platform, intuitive practices invite us to check in, not check out, not to forecast tomorrow, but to find our footing today. Because sometimes, the most powerful form of clarity isn't knowing what's next. It's feeling seen where you are.

A former US combat fighter pilot claims a UFO encounter he had while zipping around in the sky at 30,000 feet was one of the “wildest experiences” he's had in his seasoned military career.

Maj. Ryan Bodenheimer, a former ace of the US Air Force Thunderbirds and F-15E combat fighter pilot, recounted on his YouTube channel earlier this month how he came close to almost colliding with a UFO shaped like a “perfect rectangle” while on a training mission in southern Wyoming.

Bodenheimer alleged that he was flying during the day at about 30,000 feet in the sky, at a speed of 400 knots (460 mph), when a “bright object” caught his attention off in the distance, “out of nowhere.”

However, Bodenheimer realized that the object was on a “collision course” with his aircraft.

“I put my hand on the control stick, I'm about to turn off the autopilot, and then I realized we weren't going to hit, and all of a sudden it came more into view, and it was a rectangular shape,” he said. “This was like essentially a perfect rectangle.”

He claims the object appeared to be “30 to 40 feet” high, with “bright white” along the outside edges that looked to be “glowing” and a clear center.

“I know it sounds like I'm talking about a delicious pastry, but this was the wildest experience I've ever had,” the former fighter pilot said.

Bodenheimer, for a moment, theorized that the object could be a weather balloon, but he claimed that it didn't look like anything he had ever seen in the sky before.

“There's no wings on this thing, no exhaust. The edges were so bright they were pulsing. Aerodynamically, this thing shouldn't be going at close to 400 knots. For a rectangle to be flying through the air was a wild experience,” he said.

He said that he wasn't picking up any signal on his radar and wasn't experiencing any radio interference as it kept pace with his jet at 400 knots just a short distance away.

“It really was defying any type of aeronautical laws that I've learned,” Bodenheimer shared.

The suspected UFO then “zooms off,” and Bodenheimer said he called into air traffic control to report the encounter.

After telling the controller what happened, he said there was a “dead silence” before they told the fighter pilot they'd have other aircraft be on the lookout for the object.

“I never heard anything about it [after],” the former fighter pilot said.

However, he did do some searching of his own and said there was a report filed that day on an “anomalous object” spotted in his area.

Bodenheimer said for years he never wanted to discuss his two run-ins with UFOs after worrying about the “stigma” around other pilots who have shared their encounters.

However, the pilot-turned-YouTuber said that since the stigma has dissipated, he is more comfortable opening up about his experience, with more reports of military pilots encountering UFO-like objects in the sky over the last two decades.

Southern Wyoming is notoriously known for having some of the most UFO sightings in the country, according to the Cowboy State Daily. 

The city of Cheyenne, which is home to Warren Air Force Base, has had over 50 reported aerial phenomena, out of the state's 421 sightings since 1995.
